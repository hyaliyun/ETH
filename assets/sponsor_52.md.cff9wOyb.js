It was at the end of the short 1-in-30 Folkestone Harbour Branch Line which joined the South Eastern Main Line at Folkestone Junction. The branch and harbour station were provided for boat trains from London which connected with the ferry services to Calais and Boulogne. The branch and station closed to regular passenger train services in 2001 although they were used by the Venice-Simplon Orient Express (VSOE) and railtours until 2009. An occasional inspection train used the line until the it was officially closed on 31 May 2014. History 19th century left Folkestone Harbour was in decline in the 1830s, as nearby Dover became an increasingly important cross-channel port. Ships had difficulty approaching because of drifting shingle blocking the entryway. The harbour was acquired by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in August 1843 for redevelopment, but the steep chalk downs around the town made it impractical to route a main railway line through it. Consequently, a branch line was proposed. Construction began in 1843, with the line intended mainly for freight. The route left the main line at Folkestone Junction and was double tracked, running at a gradient of 1 in 32. It reached the harbour on a viaduct designed by SER chief engineer William Cubitt. A swing bridge was added to the viaduct in 1847, which allowed trains to cross the harbour and reach the southern pier. For most of its life, the station's main traffic was passengers travelling on boat trains direct to London, albeit with a change of direction (reversal) at Folkestone East. The SER planned to extend the branch line from to to reach the harbour directly, but were blocked by the Earl of Radnor who owned the land. The line was passed by the Board of Trade for passenger use in 1848. The station was opened on 1 January 1849, but was replaced by another on a different site in 1856. This second station went through periods of temporary closure: from 29 November 1915 until 1 March 1919; from 4 September 1939 until 1945; from 13 to 20 March 1960; and between 1 January and 11 April 1992. The station was frequently used during World War I, where soldiers would disembark for a ship to Flanders. A three-track wide goods shed was added to the station in 1881. It moved in 1899 and 1910, before closing in 1919. It continued to be used for rail purposes until it was demolished in the early 1960s. The swing bridge over the harbour was replaced in 1893. The current bridge was constructed by the Southern Railway in 1930, designed by the company's chief engineer George Ellson. 20th - 21st century The line was electrified at the same time as the main line during the \\"Kent Coast Electrification ‚Äì Stage 2\\" in June 1961, and passenger trains were formed of electric multiple units. Freight services were withdrawn on 17 August 1968. In 1994, the opening of the Channel Tunnel led to the majority of ferry operators moving to other ports in the South East, with the result that only two services per day were arriving at Folkestone Harbour, to connect with the Hoverspeed SeaCat services. When these were moved to Ramsgate, the station closed to ordinary rail traffic in 2001. Sometime after 2001, the line was singled for operational purposes, although the disused line is still in position. The swing bridge over the harbour was Grade II listed in January 2012. Services Until 2009, Venice Simplon Orient Express operated two scheduled services per week to Folkestone Harbour on its London to Paris route, which ran on Thursday and Sunday between March and November when the British Pullman service terminated there. Passengers were transferred by coach to the Eurotunnel terminal, where they joined a Eurotunnel Shuttle to Calais to pick up the Orient Express in France. Golden Arrow at Folkestone Harbour. Closure Plans to regenerate Folkestone Harbour included 1,000 new houses and apartments, but they could not be practically served by the branch line. Network Rail decided that it could not justify spending considerable amounts of money to maintain and upgrade the route, so it began the process to close the station permanently. The viaduct would be retained as a new pedestrian route. A closure ceremony with an official last train took place on 12 April 2008.Railway Herald Issue 127 The closure was objected by DB Schenker, the Department for Transport and Southeastern. During 2008, the Venice-Simplon Orient Express still used Folkestone Harbour with its last train travelling on 13 November,Railway Herald Issue 155 and a number of rail tours visited the branch. Advertised as the last train, a steam hauled rail tour visited the branch on 14 March 2009.Railway Herald Issue 170 Reliant on closure of the line, a proposed Folkestone Harbour and Seafront Masterplan included plans to demolish the viaduct to make way for a new marina. An association opposing the closure was formed, with the primary aim of gaining control of the branch either through purchase or a lease with an option to buy.Steam Railway Magazine, Issue 360, 6 March ‚Äì 2 April 2009 The group, called the Remembrance Line Association proposes turning it into a mainline connected heritage railway, a 'Leaving for War' museum and a memorial dedicated to the troops that arrived on trains to the branch and left on ships to fight in both World War I and World War II. It also proposes hosting regular national railtours to the branch, and would permanently operate a tourist shuttle service up and down the 1in30 gradient, utilising its own rolling stock and locomotives. Further plans include a revived passenger ferry to Boulogne. On 21 December 2008, the Remembrance Line Association ran a railtour to the branch using the Southern Railway preserved diesel electric Class 201 No. 1001. On 20 March 2009, Network Rail announced they had begun the formal process to close the line and station on cost grounds, having redeveloped Folkestone West with new waiting facilities for the VSOE passengers. However, up to August 2010, the closure process had not proceeded past the statutory 'mothballing' stage, making the railway still officially operational. This was to allow protracted negotiations between all interested parties to run their full course to ensure the optimum benefits for the Folkestone Harbour statutory port area and to fully investigate heritage, conservation and other planning issues pertaining to the Shepway District as a whole. On 20 November 2013 the Department for Transport published a proposal to close the line and station serving Folkestone Harbour. Consultation on the closure ended on 28 February 2014, and the line was formally closed on 31 May 2014. Restoration View of Folkestone Harbour station platforms 1 and 2 following 2018 refurbishment works Folkestone Harbour ‚Äì Customs House ‚Äì Urban Room In 2015, the Folkestone Harbour Company commenced a ¬£3.5 million project to refurbish the viaduct and the station, retaining the remaining tracks, and repairing the canopies and the Customs House. The viaduct across the harbour was opened as a pedestrian route to the station in September 2017. The restoration of the station has included the installation of bilingual signage and platform lighting for platforms 1 and 2 based on 1950s evidence, and the beige and green colour scheme for the walls, columns and canopies originally used by South Eastern Railway around 1900. The imposing Folkestone Harbour Station Customs House, built in 1856, was destroyed by bombing in WWII, but the luggage tagging room survived. This room has been restored and was reopened in 2017, and has hosted exhibitions i.e. the Urban Room from the Folkestone Triennnial. A number of box cars are being installed on the tracks, and several original Pullman carriages built for the London ‚Äì Folkestone route have been purchased and are currently in the process of renovation, to be installed in the station in 2019. Several artworks from the Folkestone Triennial 2011, 2014 and 2017 are installed in the station. These include the Rug People by Varga Weisz and the large Folkestone sign by Patrick Tiuttofuoco In the future, Folkestone Harbour station will become integrated into the wider development of the beachfront and the harbour, with restaurants, workshops, galleries and nightclubs to be built alongside the station platforms. Incidents On 19 March 1844, a platelayer was killed on the incline leading into the station when he was hit by a coal train without brakes.

The one on the right, the right colic flexure is known as the hepatic flexure. The one on the left, the left colic flexure is known as the splenic flexure. Structure The right colic flexure or hepatic flexure (as it is next to the liver) is the sharp bend between the ascending colon and the transverse colon. The hepatic flexure lies in the right upper quadrant of the human abdomen. It receives blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery. The left colic flexure or splenic flexure (as it is close to the spleen) is the sharp bend between the transverse colon and the descending colon. The splenic flexure is a watershed region as it receives dual blood supply from the terminal branches of the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery, thus making it prone to ischemic damage in cases of low blood pressure because it does not have its own primary source of blood. In the context of ischemia, the splenic flexure is sometimes referred to as Griffith's point, along with the upper rectum (Sudak's point).

He was the second son of Otto II, Margrave of Meissen and Hedwig of Brandenburg. Biography Dietrich fell out with his brother, Albrecht the Proud as his mother persuaded his father to change the succession so that Dietrich was given the Margraviate of Mei√üen and Albrecht (although the older son) the Margraviate of Wei√üenfels. Albrecht took his father prisoner to try to make him return the succession to the way it had been. After Otto obtained his release by order of the emperor Frederick I, he had only just renewed the war when he died in 1190. Albrecht took back the Mei√üen margraviate from his brother. Dietrich attempted to regain the margraviate, supported by Landgraf Hermann I of Thuringia, whose daughter he was married to. In 1195, however, he left on a pilgrimage to Palestine.Heinrich Theodor Flathe: Dietrich der Bedr√§ngte. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).

Dietrich finally came into possession of his inheritance two years later on Henry's death. At the time of the struggle between the two rival kings Philip of Swabia and Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, Phillip gave Dietrich the tenure of the march of Mei√üen again. After that time, Dietrich was on Phillip's side and remained true to the Staufer even after Phillip was murdered in 1208. Dietrich became caught up in dangerous disagreements with the city of Leipzig and the Mei√üen nobility. After a fruitless siege of Leipzig, in 1217 he agreed to a settlement but then took over the city by trickery, had the city walls taken down and built three castles of his own within the city, full of his own men. Death Margrave Dietrich died on 18 February 1221, possibly poisoned by his doctor, instigated into doing so by the people of Leipzig and the dissatisfied nobility.

It is attached to the Parachute Regiment. The unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the 50th Parachute Brigade in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as 9th Parachute Commando Battalion, is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army. History The parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The 50th Indian Parachute Brigade was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British 151st Parachute Battalion, the British Indian Army 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.Parachute Regiment, India on GlobalSecurity.org The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952. In 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded 44th Airborne Division. In the post- independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade‚Äîthe 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the Jammu and Kashmir operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, Naushera, Jhangar and Poonch, and were awarded the respective Battle Honours. On 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, an ad hoc commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the Brigade of the Guards. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. Lt Col Megh Singh was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the Parachute Regiment and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in Gwalior. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies. 10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the Western Desert and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions. In 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). On 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the centre. 1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when 21 Maratha Light Infantry was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process. 1971 Indo-Pakistan War The unit first saw action in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war, the first six-man assault team was inserted deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka. In the Western Sector the unit was also involved in the Battle of Chamb. Operation Mandhol Operation Mandhol was a raid carried out by soldiers from the 9 Para (SF) to seek and destroy Pakistani artillery located in hostile territory near a village called Mandole. During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from Poonch and crossed the Poonch River. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense gunfight took place between the Indian raiders and Pakistan Army soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971. This operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. Pakistan Army officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the Indian Military Academy.  Chachro Raid  A series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as The Desert Scorpions) at Chachro, Virawah, Nagarparkar and Islamkot during the 1971 Indo- Pakistani war. The objective of these raids were to hit Pakistan military installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as desert warfare. During the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking Pakistan military installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties. The raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a LMG, to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts. Soon, a pathfinder team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the Pakistan Rangers in Chachro. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of 7 December. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured Chachro. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. Chachro was subsequently handed over to Indian infantrymen and the Alpha team proceeded further. The Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and Nagarparkar. They reached Virawah before the dawn of 8 December, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. Hand- to-hand combat between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by gunfights. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to Nagarparkar and captured it by the morning of 8 December. Following this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack an ammunition dump in Islamkot. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on 17 December but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors. Operation Bluestar 1984 In 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in Operation Blue Star. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the Golden Temple to evict Sikh militants in Punjab. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. Shabeg Singh (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours. Sri Lanka 1987 The late 1980s saw the Para (SF) in action in Sri Lanka, as part of Operation Pawan. However, the lack of proper planning by the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPF), and insufficient intelligence on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam's (LTTE) whereabouts, caused the initial heli-borne assault on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests. Six soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track Velupillai Prabhakaran but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning. After the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF). This battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around Mullaittivu. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka. Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives With the capture of Maldives, an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) mercenaries, the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of IL-76, An-32 and An-12 transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the National Security Service HQ. Later 7 Para and part of 17 Para Field Regiment were also deployed to the Maldives. When mercenaries tried to escape by sea along with hostages, they were intercepted by the Indian navy. Thus, 6 Para, and the 17 Para Field Regiment conducted the first-ever international intervention by the Indian army without any loss of life. 1999 Kargil War In 1999 nine out of ten Parachute battalions were deployed for Operation Vijay in Kargil, which bears testimony to the operational profile of the Regiment. While the Parachute Brigade cleared the Mushkoh Valley intrusions, 5 PARA was actively involved in the forgotten sector of Batalik, and was awarded the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Unit Citation. Operation Khukri 2000, Sierra Leone Operation Khukri was a rescue mission conducted by the 2 PARA (SF) in Sierra Leone in June 2000. About 90 operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gurkha Rifles who were surrounded and held captive by Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels for over 75 days. Just 90 Para (SF) forced 2000-5000 members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) divided into 5 battalions to surrender. This ultimately led to the liberation of Freetown. Operation Summer Storm 2009 On 11 April 2009, the 57 Mountain Division of the Indian Army based in Manipur, Para Commandos along with the para-military Assam Rifles and State Police, launched a counter insurgency operation, code-named \\"Operation Summer Storm\\" in the Loktak Lake region and adjoining Loktak Lake in Bishnupur District, located south of State capital of Imphal. The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported. Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India Paratroopers and Para (SF) have conducted thousands of counter-insurgency (COIN) operations in Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and the eastern states in India. Sometimes these units work with the Rashtriya Rifles (COIN force) in complicated operations. Since the mid-1990s, the role of Paratroopers and Para (SF) as a counter terrorism force has increased substantially. They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), National Security Guards (NSG) and special units of the Rashtriya Rifles - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir. They may also include MARCOS personnel, many of whom are seconded to the Army for CT operations. Counter-terrorist operation in Samba On 26 September 2013, terrorists dressed in Army fatigues stormed a police station and then an Army camp in the Jammu region killing 10 people, including an Army officer, in twin fidayeen attacks. The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army. Authorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015 Based on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (K) (NSCN) and the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the Nagaland and Manipur border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps. 70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from Dhruv helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong. In its statement after the operation, the Indian Army said it was in communication with Myanmar and that, \\"There is a history of close cooperation between our two militaries. We look forward to working with them to combat such terrorism.\\" The Indian Army claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties (158 reported) on the attackers behind the ambush of the Army on 4 June, which claimed the lives of 18 Army jawans (soldiers) of 6 Dogra Regiment from the Chandel district of Manipur. This has been noted as the largest attack on the Indian Army after the Kargil war of 1999. Surgical strikes in Pakistan- administered Kashmir On 29 September 2016, India attacked the strike targeted areas close to the Line of Control (LoC), where militants congregate for their final briefings before sneaking across it into India. An Indian security source said the operation began with Indian forces firing artillery across the frontier to provide cover for three to four teams of 70‚Äì80 para SF commandos from 4 and 9 Para (Special Forces) to cross the LoC at several points shortly after midnight IST on 29 September (18:30 hours UTC, 28 Sept.). Teams from 4 Para SF crossed the LoC in the Nowgam sector of Kupwara district, with teams from 9 Para SF simultaneously crossing the LoC in Poonch district.[2] [16] By 2 a.m. IST, according to army sources, the special forces teams had travelled - on foot, and had begun destroying the terrorist bases with hand-held grenade and 84 mm rocket launchers. The teams then swiftly returned to the Indian side of the LoC, suffering only one injury, a soldier wounded after tripping a land mine.[2] The Indian army said the strike was a pre-emptive attack on the militants' bases, claiming that it had received intelligence that the militants were planning \\"terrorist strikes\\" against India.[36] [37] India said that, in destroying \\"terrorist infrastructure\\" it also attacked \\"those who are trying to support them,\\" indicating it also attacked Pakistani soldiers.[48] India later briefed opposition parties and foreign envoys, but did not disclose operational details.[16] The footage from the strike captured by overhead drones and thermal imaging was released to the media afterwards. It was also informed that around 40-50 militants were killed and many more injured in one of the surgical strikes. However, the Pakistan army dismissed India's claim, and instead claimed that Indian troops had not crossed the LoC but had only skirmished with Pakistani troops at the border, resulting in the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and the wounding of nine. Organization Para SF contingent marching on the occasion of Republic Day Parade 2020. The Parachute Regiment presently has nine Special Forces, five Airborne, two Territorial Army and one Counter-Insurgency (Rashtriya Rifles) battalions in its fold. The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions. In the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment. Para (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel. They have to hide their identity from general public. The Special Group, a confidential special forces unit of the Research and Analysis Wing, recruits soldiers from the Para SF. Functions * Intelligence collection, special reconnaissance * sabotage of vital enemy infrastructure and communications through deep penetration and surgical strikes behind enemy lines. * Covert and overt/direct action special operations as part of the Indian Army's counter-terrorist and counter- insurgency operations. * Hostage rescue operations within and beyond Indian territory. The unit is tasked with missions such as special operations, direct action, hostage rescue, counter-terrorism, special reconnaissance, foreign internal defense, counter-proliferation, counter-insurgency, seek and destroy and personnel recovery.

Some enter the Para regiments fresh from recruitment, while others transfer in from regular army units.Para Commandos at Bharat Rakshak.com They are put through a probationary period / selection process of three months for Paratroopers (Airborne) Battalions (5,6,7,23,29) and six months for Para (Special Forces) battalions (1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,21 PARA), in order to be a Para (Special Forces) all personnel are first required to qualify as Paratroopers; once selected the candidates may choose to advance to the SF selection, which takes place twice a year in the spring and the autumn term. It is one of the longest and tough training in the India, the candidates are exposed to sleep deprivation, humiliation, exhaustion, mental and physical torture. Deaths have been reported during this selection process. The attrition rate is very high, and selection rarely exceeds 15 percent. Even though a candidate may have cleared selection, he is not formally inducted into the regiment until completion of the Balidan Padh. After training, the candidates are involved in active operations in a hostile zone for a year. Provided if the candidates survives the Balidan Padh, they shall earn the Balidan Badge and formally get inducted into the regiment. There are nine Para (SF) battalions and soldiers are selected accordingly. An example of this would be the 10 Para (SF) who are also known as Desert Scorpions. The probation period for this is six-month and the probationers are selected accordingly for desert warfare. The 9 Para (SF) who specialise in Mountain warfare go through a nine-month course at the Special Forces training centre in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh which is followed by further specialised selection. 1 Para specialises in mountain warfare. This concept of geographical specialisation was over time reduced and each Para (SF) battalion is trained to operate in various different terrains and climates. Soldiers of the Indian Army volunteer for the course irrespective of rank. Depending on the battalion, the probation period varies from three months, six months or nine months, with additional time for specialized skills selection. Over the probation period, all soldiers are stripped of their ranks, including officers, and are known as probationers or probies. During any day of the course, a probationer can opt to leave the course.India's Paratroopers: Earning the Badge, Discovery Channel, Monday 26 February 2018 - 9 pm to 10 pm IST The completion rate is under 12-15 per cent and this slightly high completion rate is because many probationers are drawn from their regimental battalions. Each Special Forces operative specialises in various skills such as weapons, demolition, navigation, communication, medical. PARA (SF) work in small teams, five to eight men, and are also focused on strategic reconnaissance, surveillance, target designation (RSTAD) Hostage rescue and direct action (DA) tasks and are selected and trained accordingly.Employment of India's Special Operations Forces - DEEPAK SINHA AND RAMESH BALAKRISHNAN - Observer Research Foundation http://www.orfonline.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/06/ORF_IssueBrief_150_SinhaBalakrishnan.pdf Those who complete the probation period and are inducted into the Para (SF) undergo further selection and training, but to earn the Balidan (sacrifice) badge, they have to further survive being deployed in active operations in hostile zones, known as the Balidan Padh.  Four phases  buddy pair on an all- terrain vehicle at a public demonstration in 2020. Para SF commandos being extracted using a helicopter during a public demonstration in 2020. There are four phases to become a Para (SF): * Basic military training - to start the process a candidate first must join the Indian Army and complete the basic training requirements, which vary according to the training center and prospective role. * Pre-Selection - this stage encompasses administrative procedures and the soldier applying for the Para (Air) or Para (SF) and the necessary medical requirements. * Selection (encompassing a selection process and basic SF training) - the duration of this stage has changed over the years. For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the Parachute Regiment. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10 kg sandbag becomes a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10 km, 20 km, 30 km and 40 km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night. In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra. * Advanced SF Training \\\\- all those who opt for Para (SF) must first qualify for Para (Air). Although this is also a training phase, it is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training, land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics, close quarter battle (CQB) training, urban warfare, counter-terrorism, unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the Indian Defense Forces.  Training centers and courses  * Commando Training Camp, Belgaum, Karnataka * 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh * Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan * High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir * Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, Kochi * Counter insurgency, at the Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram * Indian Special Forces Training School, Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; * Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra  90-day probation  Some of the training during the 90-day selection includes: * Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'. This includes hours of rigorous exercises apart from other tests and skills training such as blindfolded team assembly, weapons training, demolition, navigation, communication, medical and cooking skills. Probationers are also taught animal handling skills, insertion and extraction techniques and have to learn several languages. Many probationers are not able to complete this stage of the course itself and up to 20% drop out here. * Day 45: The 36-hour Para SF stress test includes 36 hours of exercises, maneuvers, insertion, extraction where the probationers stress capabilities are put to the test. It starts with a 10 km speed march with 30 kg battle loads and an additional 40 kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85 kg in weight. During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted \\\\- simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10 km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave. * Day 56: The Para SF 100 km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10 kg battle load and personal weapon of 7 kg they have to run 100 km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal. The run is divided into four stages. * Day 60 to 90: The final and toughest test is reserved for those who make it to this stage, the Counter Terror Operations. Not much is publicly known about this stage or the other parts of this course. At the end of the 90-day probation period, the successful candidates receive and wear their maroon berets for the first time and go through a glass eating tradition. Training The initial training to become a special forces operator is 3.5 years, the longest anywhere, but the training is also a continuous process. In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advanced training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable parachutes called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to is also perfected. For combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water. The daily routine begins with a morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death. Night and weapons training and field craft involving treks with loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with combat loads with distances over to and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted. In addition to this in- house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare. These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in Belgaum, Karnataka, the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang Arunachal Pradesh, the desert warfare school in Rajasthan, the High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS) in Sonamarg, Kashmir, the Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the Indian special forces training school in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh. These schools are among the finest of their kind anywhere, and routinely host students from other countries. Members of USSOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) and UKSF (United Kingdom Special Forces) have conducted joint training exercises with the Indian Paras. SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. U.S. Army Special Forces also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the French Foreign Legion also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them. Para (SF) troops can also undergo a complete Combat Divers course, after which they earn a combat diver badge. They are also experienced in conducting SHBO (special heli-borne operations) and typically employ Cheetahs, MI-8/MI-17 or HAL (Dhruv) helicopters for this purpose. Joint exercises with other nations Para SF with US special forces during Vajraprahar 2019 Para SF train alongside US special forces during Vajra Prahar 2018 The Para (SF) conduct a series of joint exercises, named Vajra Prahar, with the United States Army every year, in which about 100 personal from the US and Indian special forces participate.Indian and US special forces to conduct counter-terror exercise - Times Of India INDRA is a series of joint exercise with Russian special forces, and operation Sampriti is the name for joint exercises with Bangladeshi special forces. Para (SF) also conducts exercises and training with the special forces of Israel. The Ajeya Warrior is a series of exercises with regular infantry units of the UK (as the UK's special forces are highly classified). Indian special forces also conduct exercises with forces of the following 16 friendly countries: the United States, France, the UK, Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Maldives, Seychelles, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. International competitions Personnel from the Para (SF) have participated in international competitions like Airborne Africa, Cambrian Patrol. This exercise was designed to test the endurance, combat efficiency, and combat readiness of the special forces community. The regiment has a record of highest tally wins in both these exercises that is hosted annually ever since their participation was inducted in the competition hosted by Botswana in Africa's Kalahari Desert from 8‚Äì10 June 2002, in which 10 Para (SF) participated. Special forces from other nations like the Special Air Service of the UK and the Green Berets of the US also participated. In 2014 a team from the Indian army won the gold medal out of the 140 teams that participated  Influence on foreign units  The Para SF has provided training to special forces from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. In December 2013, 60 Afghan special forces were trained by the 10 Para (SF) at the Thar Desert. A month earlier, the Tajikistani special forces had undergone training. Equipment The following equipment are reportedly used by the Para (SF): Small Arms *Beretta semi-automatic pistols *Glock pistols *MP9 machine pistol *Heckler & Koch MP5 Sub-machine gun *Micro Uzi 9mm Sub-machine gun *FN Scar (L) 5.56 x 45 mm assault rifle. *IWI TAR-21 Tavor Assault rifle *M4A1 Carbine *FN Scar (H) 7.62 x 51 mm assault rifle. *Sako TRG .338 Lapua Magnum sniper rifle. *IWI Galil Sniper Semi-automatic sniper rifle *Barrett M107A1 heavy sniper rifle. * IWI Negev NG-7 light machine gun. *.50 caliber machine gun. *Mk 48 Maximi general purpose machine guns. *PKM General purpose machine gun *C-90-CR-RB (M3) rocket launcher. *RL MkIII 84mm Recoilles rifle *Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle(Mark-4) light weight rocket-launcher. *B-300 Shipon 82mm Rocket launcher *Spike (ATGM) Rocket launcher Transport *C-130J Super Hercules tactical transport aircraft. *Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft. *HAL Dhruv utility helicopter. *All Terrain Vehicles *HAL Cheetak utility helicopter Insignia Para (SF) personnel, like other parachute troops in the Indian military, wear a maroon beret. In addition, they wear a \\"Special Forces\\" tab on each shoulder. Personnel who serve in the Para (SF) are allowed to wear the \\"Balidan\\" (Sacrifice) patch on their right pocket below the name plate, which is similar to the SAS beret insignia; only para commandos are allowed to wear the patch. Para (SF) personnel may grow beards, as this allows them to blend in with the civilian population, especially in Jammu and Kashmir. The insignia on their beret is drawn from the near identical insignia of the British Special Air Service.

It was formed in September 2004 and has a current strength of over 1500 personnel. The unit derives its name from Garuda, a divine bird-like creature in Hinduism. Garud is tasked with the protection of critical Air Force bases and installations; search and rescue during peace and hostilities and disaster relief during calamities. Archived from the original in Wayback Machine. Presently, Garuds are deployed in Congo as part of the UN peace keeping operations.  History  Garud Commandos at Air Force Day 2018 After attempts by terrorists to attack two major air bases in Jammu and Kashmir in 2001, Indian Air Force commanders felt the need for a specialized force to protect these critical elements and to have a dedicated Commando Force trained in Special Forces techniques, Combat Search and Rescue, Reconnaissance, Counter Insurgency (COIN) Operations and Emergency in response to terror-threats to airfields. While the Army might have provided some Special forces units to the Air Force, its units were always subject to being posted out on rotation to other areas as per the Army's requirements. It was felt that the specialized training the air force would have provided such units would have to be repeated again and again for the replacement units. The initial plans mooted in October 2001 called for a specialized force with 2000 commandos. The group was originally called \\"Tiger Force\\", but was later renamed as \\"Garud Force\\". In order to address the need for a dedicated force, in September 2003, the Government of India authorized a 1080 strong force to be raised and trained on the lines of the Para commandos of the army and MARCOS of the Indian Navy, with the mandate of performing niche, Air Force specific operational tasks. Soon after, the first batch of 100 volunteers from the IAF No.1 Airmen Training Center at Belgaum, Karnataka were earmarked to undergo Garud Training at Gurgaon. The Garuds were first unveiled on 6 February 2004, when the first batch of 62 \\"Air Commandos\\" passed out of training in New Delhi.Picture of Garud demonstrations during the Passing out ceremonyIAF Garud commandoes pass out, Second passing out batch of Garuds, Indian Express, December 18, 2003'Garud' the special Commando Force joins IAF , indiainfo.com, 5 February 2004. The Garuds were first seen publicly during the Air Force Day celebrations at New Delhi on 8 October 2004.Dhruv to star in flypast, The Tribune, 5 October 2004. In the aftermath of the Pathankot Terror Attack, Indian Air Force decided to raise ten additional squadrons of Garud commandos, comprising about 700 personnel, bringing the total strength of the force to 1780.  Responsibilities  The mandated tasks of the Garuds include direct action, special reconnaissance, rescuing downed pilots in hostile territory, establishing airbases in hostile territory and providing air-traffic control to these airbases. The Garuds also undertake suppression of enemy air defences and the destruction of other enemy assets such as radars, evaluation of the outcomes of Indian airstrikes and use laser designators to guide Indian airstrikes. The security of IAF installations and assets are usually performed by the Air Force Police and the Defence Security Corps even though some critical assets are protected by the Garuds.Garud Commandos at Exercise Vayu Shakti 2019. Their airbase protection task also includes, when necessary, rendering inaccessible weapons systems and other assets by sealing them off. The tasks they perform also includes counter-terrorism, airborne assault, anti-hijacking, hostage rescue and assist civilian relief operations during calamities.  Organisation  Garud personnel are enlisted as airmen in the Indian Air Force. The Garud commandos are organised into fifteen 'flights'. These flights are deployed at air force stations. Each flight is led by an officer who holds the rank of a Squadron Leader or a Flight Lieutenant and is composed of around 60 to 70 men who usually operate in squads of 14 soldiers. The Garud Commando Force has a reported strength of over 1500 personnel as of 2017. A Wing Commander rank officer commands the force. Additional personnel are planned to be added to the force.  Training   Airmen Selection Process  A Garud Commando of IAF during a training exercise in USA, 2008. Unlike its counterparts in the Army and Navy, candidates for Garud Commandos are not selected from volunteers of other branches. Recruitment to the Garuds is done directly through airmen selection centres via advertisements. Candidates found eligible for the force is put through a process of rigorous physical training. Candidates have only one chance to become a Garud trainee. Once a recruit completes training and meets required standards, he is absorbed into the Commando force and is retained in this stream throughout his career. Wherever he is posted in the IAF, he will be part of a Garud Unit. This approach ensures that the Commando Force retains its highly trained men all through their career with the IAF. The first batch of Officers for the Garuds were volunteers from the Cadets of the Ground Duty Officers course being trained at the Air Force Academy, Dundigal, Telangana. These officers on successful completion have been absorbed into Garud Force and will be permanently assigned to the force till the point they reach senior ranks and go for higher postings.  Training  Garud Commandos para-dropping at Exercise Iron Fist at Pokhran in 2013. Garud trainees undergo a 72-week training. The Basic Training course, which is the longest among all the Indian special forces but it also includes basic training. The total duration of training before a trainee can qualify as a fully operational Garud is around 3 years. The initial phase is a three-month probationary training which filters in the promising candidates for the next phases of training. This phase, which usually has a high attrition (Drop-out) rate is conducted at the Garud Regimental Training Centre located at Hindon, Ghaziabad near New Delhi. The subsequent phase of special operations training is imparted by the Special Frontier Force, the army special forces and NSG. Those who qualify, proceed to the Parachute Training School (PTS) at Agra to complete the basic airborne phase. Trainees are trained along with paratroopers of the Indian Army. The remainder of the phases concentrates on niche fields like jungle and snow survival, demolition, etc. Garuds also train at the diving school of the Indian Navy and the Army's Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS). The final phase of training is active operations on being attached to Special Force Units of the Indian Army, which helps the Garuds in gaining operational experience. After induction, the commandos also undergo advanced training including anti-hijack counter-insurgency training, jungle and snow survival techniques, specialized weapon handling and advanced diving skills.Garud: IAF's commando force takes off , Rediff.com, 6 February 2004.

History Cebu City National Science High School, commonly known as Sci-Hi is a Secondary Science public High School system located in Salvador St. Labangon, Cebu City, Philippines. It was founded on July 17, 1970 and nationalized in the 1974-1975 school year. The Cebu City National Science High School, which had been known as Cebu City Science High School, was established on July 17, 1970 as the brainchild of Dr. Aurelio A. Tiro, the then Cebu City Schools Division Superintendent. The school's overall concept was patterned after the objectives of the Philippine Science High School and in line with the Government's Science and Technological Education and Manpower Development Program. On April 28, 1970, Resolution No. 81 of the Cebu City School Board was passed by the Hon. City Councilor Raymundo Crystal, who was then Chairman of the Committee on Education, and requested the Cebu City Council to initiate the funding of a Cebu City Science High School with an appropriation of P50,000. Then it was followed with Resolution No. 772 of the Cebu City Council on May 7, 1970 appropriating the requested amount for the establishment of the school during the incumbency of Honorable Mayor Eulogio Borres. The school was nationalized under Presidential Decree 105 in SY 1974-1975. Cebu City Science High School was established in Barangay Labangon in its present site, which is a property donated by Don Sergio Osme√±a, Sr. to the City Government. The first building of the school was a modified 3-unit steel pre-fab Marcos-type school building. The school drew a development plan, and the founding principal, Mrs. Rosalina R. Kintanar, sought direct financial aid from the Office of the President in order to construct a two-storey Academic Library (AL) Building. The Science Building (SB) that was reconstructed from the pre-fab Marcos-type original, the ESEP Building, and the School Gymnasium were added during the administration of Mrs. Nicanora P. Creus. Succeeding principals also had their share in the development of school buildings and facilities. With her ingenuity and brilliance, the founding principal, Mrs. Rosalina R. Kintanar pioneered in gathering 64 intelligent students and 5 competent teachers who started with what is now the Cebu City National Science High School. The founding principal was succeeded by equally competent administrators in the persons of Mr. Tereso M. Edo, who was appointed in April 1982, Mrs. Nicanora P. Creus in October 1985, Mrs. Pilar A. Tesaluna in February 1999, Mrs. Severina B. Chin as OIC from May 2001-July 2001, Mr. Jesus G. Ortiz in August 2001 and presently Mrs. Severina B. Chin as OIC from June 2002-October 2002 and finally re-appointed on November 15, 2002. In June 2012 Mrs. Marites V. Pati√±o was appointed as the Principal. Currently, the school is being headed by Dr. Evelyn R. Pielago which assumed office on June 2017. Admission To better prepare each student for the tasks, activities and responsibilities that lie ahead, each student must pass both written (conducted on the third Saturday of February) and oral (conducted on the second Saturday of March) entrance examinations. All applicants must be part of the upper 10% of their graduating class and must have at least a grade of 85% in Science, Math, and English and 83% or above in all other subject areas in any grading period or the equivalent grade as to the grading system used by a school as duly certified by its principal. Pupils graduating from Science Elementary classes are required with a grade of at least 83% in Science, Math, and English and 80% in all other subject areas. The examination is in Science, Math and Mental Ability with which the examinee must get 83% and 80% of the total score in Science and Math, respectively, and at least an above average IQ. Hence, all successful examinees qualify for an interview that tackles all subject areas. The screening committee determines the top 175 students (formerly 140) who have to confirm for enrollment. Finally, all 175 enrollees should attend the school's orientation program as scheduled together with their parents or guardian.

Its main goal originally was to conduct covert operations behind Chinese lines in the event of another Sino-Indian War. Throughout its history, SFF has fought in India's major external wars including the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Kargil War. It has also acted in internal security, including taking part in Operation Blue Star and serving as the \\"Personal Force\\" of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to suppress opposition parties during the state of emergency from 1975 to 1977. It has been part of border operations against China, including the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes. Based in Chakrata, Uttarakhand, the force was put under the direct supervision of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and later the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's external intelligence agencyBollywood Sargam ‚Äì Special: Tibetan faujis in Bluestar , and is not part of the Indian Army but functions under their operational control with its own rank structure, charter and training infrastructure. It falls under the authority of the Directorate General on Security in the Cabinet Secretariat headed by an Inspector General (SFF) who is selected from the Major General rank of the Indian Army and who reports directly to the Prime Minister's Office. History British India precursor Tibetans have been a part of the modern Indian Army for as long as it has existed. Independent formations of Tibetan (including Ladakhi, B√∂n, Sikkimese and now Gurkha) units were to patrol and police the lands they were native to. During the time of the Great Game, the British Indian Army began to employ Tibetans as spies, intelligence agents, and even covert militia in northern India and Tibet proper. 1950s training with IB and CIA At the time of Indian independence, the northern mountain-covered region of India remained the most isolated and strategically overlooked territory of the subcontinent. During the 1950s, the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Indian Intelligence Bureau established Mustang Base in Mustang in Nepal, which trained Tibetans in guerilla warfare. The Mustang rebels brought the 14th Dalai Lama to India during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Formation Chakrata, Uttarakhand, is where SFF personnel are trained in stealth combat and scouting techniques. The idea of raising a specialized force consisting of Tibetan refugees and Tibetan resistance fighters in India against the Chinese was first mooted by General K S Thimayya when he was leading the Indian Army between May 1957 and May 1961. During the Sino-Indian War and towards the end of 1962, after hectic lobbying by the IB Chief Bhola Nath Mullik and World War II veteran Biju Patnaik, the Jawaharlal Nehru government finally ordered the raising of an elite commando unit and specialised mountain division. The primary task of SFF is defence against the People's Libration Army (PLA) Ground Force as well as conducting clandestine intelligence gathering and commando operations along the Chinese border. Chushi Gangdruk leaders were contacted for recruitment of Khampas into this new unit. The initial strength was 5000 men, mostly Khampas who were recruited at its new Mountain Training Facility at Chakrata, 100 km from the city of Dehradun. The SFF is also known as 'Establishment 22' or just '22' due to its first Inspector General, Maj. Gen. Sujan Singh Uban, who commanded the 22nd Mountain Division as an artillery officer in Europe during World War II. Uban also went on to command a Long Range Desert Group Squadron (LRDS) in North Africa during the war. The SFF made its home base at Chakrata, which was home to a large Tibetan refugee population and is a mountain town in the foothills of the Himalayas. Starting with a force of 5,000 men, the SFF commenced six months of training in rock climbing and guerrilla warfare. Initial training was conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Special Operations Unit. Both the RAW and the CIA helped in raising the force. During the same period, the Indian government also formed the Ladakh Scouts and the Nubra Guards paramilitary forces on similar lines. Many SFF members were also absorbed from the Gurkha Rifles. SFF was later incorporated into the Special Services Bureau. By late 1963, inter-service rivalry led to severe criticism by the Indian Army. To prove the SFF's worth, the Inspector General sent 120 men from the SFF on a field exercise, codenamed Garuda, with the Army. The exercise proved to be a dramatic success for the SFF and the Army was now less inclined to criticise the force. However the force faced other problems such as mass desertions by Tibetans. The Tibetan recruits found that smuggling was a much easier way of making money than risking their lives along the border. In 1964, the SFF, led by the Inspector General, began its airborne training at Agra. The SFF then began its own airborne training program at Sarsawa Air Force Station. In 1968 with the help of Aviation Research Centre (ARC), SFF were provided with airlift facilities and became fully airborne-qualified with a dedicated mountain and jungle warfare unit. CIA support and pull-out The SFF's weapons were all provided by the USA and consisted mainly of M-1, M-2 and M-3 sub-machine guns. Heavy weapons were not provided. The US government pulled out the CIA from the training program as relations with India soured in the early 1970s during the period of Cold War, with the Sino-Soviet split and Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China improving the bilateral relationship. The unit conducted limited cross-border reconnaissance missions as well as highly classified joint operations with the CIA in 1965 on Mount Nanda Devi in the Himalayas. Battalions and composition The SFF has a total of six battalions called 1 Vikas, 2 Vikas, 3 Vikas, 5 Vikas, 6 Vikas, and 7 Vikas. Each battalion has around 800 troopers. The six battalions are commanded by Indian Army officers of colonel rank. At least five other Indian Army officers are in a battalion. At the helm of SFF is the Inspector General (SFF), an officer of Major General rank. The Special Group, or 4 Vikas, functions under a separate chain of command under the RAW. Historically, by the late 1960s, the SFF was organised into six battalions for administrative purposes. In the past, each battalion, consisting of six companies, was commanded by a Tibetan who had a rank equivalent to a lieutenant colonel in the Indian Army. A Tibetan major or captain commanded each company, which was the primary unit used in operations. After the 1980s, the practice of giving Indian Army commissions to Tibetans was discontinued. Ethnically, the unit is a mixture of Tibetans and Gurkhas from Nepal. The Tibetan troopers are recruited from the dwindling population of Tibetans in India, which stood at 85,000 in 2018. The flow of Tibetans joining SFF has slowed due to the declining population of Tibetans, leading to a more ethnically mixed unit. Gurkhas have been recruited to the SFF since 1965. Tibetans currently serve as soldiers and non- commissioned officers and were in the past given officer commissions. Women are also recruited for specialized operations as well as in signal and medical companies. Operations SFF was raised with covert operations in mind, mainly along the Indo-China border; however, SFF has been fielded by the RAW and the Indian government in various covert and overt operation theatres. China Cold War In 1964 intelligence reports kept indicating that China was preparing to test a nuclear weapon at its Lop Nor nuclear installation in Xinjiang. On 16 October 1964 China did indeed test a nuclear weapon in Xinjiang. It was expected, but not enough details were known. Later in November 1964, the CIA launched a U2 flight out of Aviation Research Centre (ARC)'s Charbatia Air Base in Orissa, but its return turned out to be something of a mishap. The Lockheed U-2 overshot the runway and got stuck in slushy ground caused by heavy rain in the monsoon. Getting it unstuck and out of India without being noticed by the Indian press, then even more subject to leftist influences and hence antagonistic to the USA, was another clandestine operation. This gave all concerned quite a scare and it was decided to rely on other technical means. The CIA therefore decided to launch an electronic intelligence (ELINT) operation along with RAW and to track China's nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches. The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to Nanda Devi, involved celebrated Indian climber M S Kohli who, along with operatives of SFF and CIA (most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran STOL pilot), was to emplace a permanent ELINT device, a transceiver powered by a plutonium battery, that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China. The plan to install a snooping device was devised far away in Washington D.C., in the offices of the National Geographic Society. Barry Bishop, a photographer with the magazine, interested General Curtis LeMay of the US Air Force in the idea. The actual efforts called for the placement of a permanent ELINT device powered by a nuclear SNAP 19C power pack fuel cell. The first attempt to place this device on Nanda Devi, by a Kohli-led SFF team under the cover of a mountaineering expedition, failed as the team had to retreat in the face of adverse conditions and left the device in a small unmarked mountain cave after having hauled the device just short of the 25,645-foot peak. When another Kohli-led expedition returned the following year to recover the device, it was found to be missing.Harish Kapadia, \\"Nanda Devi\\", in World Mountaineering, Audrey Salkeld, editor, Bulfinch Press, 1998, , pp. 254‚Äì257.There are many theories about what happened. Likely ones are that the device rolled off the mountain and is now lodged at the bottom of the glacier. More imaginative theories speculate that the supposedly indestructible nuclear power pack with a highly toxic plutonium isotope in its core, with a half-life of many thousand years, is inching its way into the Ganges. Another plausible theory is that another team of Indian mountaineers came up secretly early the next season and spirited the device away for Indian nuclear scientists to study. Many Americans lean towards this, and with the legendary spymaster RN Kao in the picture anything was possible. In the meantime the Chinese not only kept testing not only nuclear weapons but also ballistic missiles at regular intervals. The urgency to gather information was never greater. Another mission was launched in 1967 to place a similar device on the Nanda Kot. This mission was successful but a couple of years later another problem cropped up: snow would pile up over the antenna and render it blind. So Kohli and a SFF team were sent once again to bring it down; this time they retrieved it successfully. In October 1967 the Chinese began testing an ICBM capable of reaching targets 6000 miles away. There was renewed urgency to find out more. So SFF mountaineers went off on one more mission in December 1969 to successfully place a gas-powered device on an undisclosed mountain, supposedly in Chinese-controlled areas. However, by the following year, the US had the first generation of TRW spy satellites in place and did not have to rely on the old ELINT devices. 2020 Ladakh skirmishes During the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes, SFF were reported to have conducted operations in Ladakh, including the capture of heights near Pangong Tso. In another incident, an official statement by the Indian Army read: \\"Indian troops pre- empted this PLA activity on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground\\". During this activity, on 1 September 2020, company leader Nyima Tenzin of SFF died in a landmine blast when undertaking a reconnaissance mission along the line of actual control. Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 Illustration showing military units and troop movements during the war SFF was part of major combat operations during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Starting in late October and November 1971, elements of the force were sent to Mizoram. An SFF Task Force of around 3000 members was deployed to conduct pre-emptive strike in support of the Indian Army formations along the Chittagong Hill Tracts and to train the local underground unit called Mujib Bahini. With cross-border attacks becoming more frequent, SFF was ordered to attack the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Bangladeshi campaign was designated Operation Mountain Eagle, and SFF members were given Bulgarian AK-47s and US-made carbines. This operation saw the first Dapon, the Tibetan equivalent of a Brigadier, in command of part of the SFF Task Force. With war imminent, SFF successfully executed several mission plans that included the destruction of the Kaptai Dam and other bridges of strategic value. The Inspector General also urged that the SFF be used to capture the second largest city, Chittagong, but the idea was found not favourable to military planners in New Delhi since the unit lacked artillery or airlift support capabilities to conduct a mission of such magnitude. After three weeks of border fighting, the SFF divided its six battalions into three columns and moved into East Pakistan on 3 December 1971. The Tibetans were given mortars and recoilless rifles and two Mil Mi-4 helicopters of the Indian Air Force, and captured several villages in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The air- operations were handled by ARC at Balasore. On the night of 14 November 1971 in the forests of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Brigadier Dhondup Gyatotsang was killed by the elite Special Service Group of the Pakistan Army. With the fall of Dhaka and Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi surrendering on 16 December 1971, SFF had lost 49 men and nearly 190 were wounded. The SFF Task Force was able to block a potential escape route for East Pakistani forces into Burma. They also halted members of Pakistan's 97 Independent Brigade and 2 Commando Battalion at the Chittagong Hill Tracts. For their bravery and courage, 580 SFF Task Force members were awarded cash prizes by the Union Government of India. Their swift covert capabilities won the force the nickname 'Phantoms of Chittagong'.

Taganrog was also the center of uezd (including the cities of Rostov on Don, Nakhichevan on Don and Mariupol) from 1816 to 1834. Rostov was subordinated to Yekaterinoslav Governorate in 1834, while Nakhichevan and Mariupol remained within Taganrog's governorate until 1859. Historical background By the end of the 18th century, Taganrog lost its importance as a military base with Crimea and Azov Sea being under command of Imperial Russia. The cities on Black Sea and Azov Sea transformed into important trade centers. The trade development demanded new measures and Alexander I of Russia introduced the office of governors (–≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫) who were in direct contact with H.I.M. The governorships (in different periods of time) were introduced in four Russian cities: Odessa, Taganrog, Feodosiya and Kerch. The emperor appointed to this post dynamic people with initiative.

He is the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, the investment advisor to the Hermitage Fund, which at one time was the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia. The Hermitage Fund was founded in partnership with Republic National Bank, with $25 million in seed capital. The fund, and associated accounts, eventually grew to $4.5 billion of assets under management. In 1997, the Hermitage Fund was the best- performing fund in the world, up 238%. The primary investment strategy of Browder was shareholder rights activism. Browder took on large Russian companies such as Gazprom, Surgutneftegaz, Unified Energy Systems, and Sidanco. In retaliation, on November 13, 2005, Browder was refused entry to Russia, deported to the UK, and declared a threat to Russian national security. Eighteen months after Browder was deported, on June 4, 2007, Hermitage Capital's offices in Moscow were raided by twenty-five officers of Russia's Interior Ministry. Twenty-five more officers raided the Moscow office of Browder's American law firm, Firestone Duncan, seizing the corporate registration documents for Hermitage's investment holding companies. Browder assigned Sergei Magnitsky, head of the tax practice at Firestone Duncan, to investigate the purpose of the raid. He discovered that while those documents were in the custody of the police, they had been used to fraudulently reregister Hermitage's holding companies to the name of an ex-convict. The reregistration of the Hermitage holding companies was an intermediate step before the perpetrators used those companies to apply for a fraudulent $230 million tax refund, awarded on December 24, 2007. In response, in June and October 2008, in testimony to the Russian State Investigative Committee, Magnitsky testified against the perpetrators of the fraud, including the Interior Ministry officials who conducted the raid on Hermitage's offices. Five weeks after his second testimony, on November 24, 2008, Sergei Magnitsky was arrested at his home; among those present at his arrest were officials he had named in his testimony. While he was in custody, Magnitsky was mistreated, and eventually fell gravely ill. The tax auditor began complaining of severe pain in his back in May 2009, and became increasingly ill over the next several months. Medical expert reports that have been carried out in the years since have concluded that for the remainder of his time in pre-trial detention, Magnitsky received inadequate medical care, and may have even been given medication that aggravated his pancreatitis. The court judgement notes that \\"domestic authorities unreasonably put his life in danger.\\" After Magnitsky's death, Browder lobbied for Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights violators, which was signed into law in 2012 by President Barack Obama. In 2013, both Magnitsky and Browder were tried in absentia in Russia for tax fraud. Both men‚ÄîMagnitsky had died four years prior‚Äîwere convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. Interpol rejected Russian requests to arrest Browder, saying the case was political. In 2014, the European Parliament voted for sanctions against 30 Russians believed complicit in the Magnitsky case; this was the first time it had taken such action. In July 2017, Browder testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On October 19, 2017, Canada enacted its own Magnitsky Act, which permits the freezing of assets and the suspension of visas when officials from Russia and other nations are found to be guilty of human rights violations; Canadian firms are prohibited from dealing with foreign nationals who have grossly violated human rights. Other countries including Estonia, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, have also enacted their own version of the Magnitsky Act. On October 21, 2017, the Russian government attempted to place Browder on Interpol's arrest list of criminal fugitives, which Interpol eventually rejected the fifth such request on October 26, 2017. After the initial request, Browder's visa waiver for the United States was automatically suspended. After a bipartisan protest by U.S. Congressional leaders, his visa waiver was restored the following day. While visiting Spain in May 2018, Browder was arrested by Spanish authorities on a new Russian Interpol warrant and transferred to an undisclosed Spanish police station. He was released two hours later, after Interpol confirmed that this was a political case. Early life and education William Felix Browder was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and he grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He is the son of mathematician Felix Browder, and the grandson of Earl Browder. He attended the University of Colorado, Boulder before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which he graduated with a degree in economics. He earned an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1989 and entered the financial sector. Family background Browder's paternal grandfather was Earl Browder, who was born in Kansas in 1891. He was a radical and had lived in the Soviet Union for several years from 1927 and married Raisa Berkman, a Jewish Russian woman, while living there. After his return to the United States in 1931, Earl Browder became the leader of the Communist Party USA from 1930 to 1945, and ran for U.S. president in 1936 and 1940. After World War II, Browder lost favor with Moscow and was expelled from the U.S. Communist Party. Earl and his wife Raisa had three children, all sons, and all three became mathematicians who headed the mathematics departments of top American universities including Bill Browder's father Felix Browder who married Eva (Tislowitz). Felix was a mathematics prodigy who had entered MIT at 16, acquired his bachelor's degree in two years, and by the age of 20 received a Ph.D. from Princeton. But during the McCarthy era, he could not find work because he was the son of the onetime head of the Communist Party USA. After a series of job rejections in the 1950s, he was championed by Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady who was then chairman of the board of Brandeis University; she overrode the rest of the board who were afraid to hire him, and he gained a position at Brandeis. Felix went on to chair the mathematics department at the University of Chicago, and in 1999 became the president of the American Mathematical Society. Felix Browder was renowned in the field of nonlinear functional analysis‚Äîa branch of mathematics with wide applications to such fields as physics, engineering, and finance. He was instrumental in establishing a science and technology center in conjunction with Princeton University and Bell Labs. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Bill Clinton, for his \\"key role in the explosive growth of nonlinear functional analysis and its applications to partial differential equations in recent years\\". Bill Browder has one sibling, Tom Browder, who entered the University of Chicago at 15, and became a leading particle physicist. Career and citizenship Browder started his career in the Eastern European practice of the Boston Consulting Group in London, then worked for Robert Maxwell's MCC conglomerate, and after that managed the Russian proprietary investments desk at Salomon Brothers. In 1999, Browder received naturalization as a British citizen. Meanwhile, he relinquished his U.S. citizenship in 1998. He cited that he did so because of \\"a legacy of bad feeling about the rule of law\\" as a result of his family having been \\"viciously persecuted\\" by U.S. authorities in the 1950s, citing especially his communist grandfather, Earl Browder who was imprisoned twice during the era of McCarthyism.Matthew Cooper. Who is Bill Browder, Vladimir Putin's Enemy Number One? Newsweek. October 27, 2017. Hermitage Capital Management Browder and Edmond Safra (1932‚Äì1999) founded Hermitage Capital Management in 1996 for the purpose of investing initial seed capital of $25 million in Russia during the period of the mass privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union. Beny Steinmetz was another of the original investors in Hermitage. Following the Russian financial crisis of 1998, Browder remained committed to Hermitage's original mission of investing in Russia, despite significant outflows from the fund. Hermitage became a prominent activist shareholder in the Russian gas giant Gazprom, the large oil company Surgutneftegaz, RAO UES, Sberbank, Sidanco, Avisma, and Volzhanka.\\"The Hermitage Fund: Media and Corporate Governance in Russia,\\" Harvard Business School Case 703-010, 2002 (26) Browder exposed management corruption and corporate malfeasance in these partly state-owned companies.\\"Gazprom and Hermitage Capital: Shareholder Activism in Russia\\", Stanford Graduate School of Business Case IB-36, 2002. He has been quoted as saying: \\"You had to become a shareholder activist if you didn't want everything stolen from you\\". In 1999, Avisma filed a RICO lawsuit against Browder and other Avisma investors including Kenneth Dart, alleging they illegally siphoned company assets into offshore accounts and then transferred the funds to U.S. accounts at Barclays. Browder and his co-defendants settled with Avisma in 2000; they sold their Avisma shares as part of the confidential settlement agreement. From 1995 to 2006, Hermitage Capital Management was one of the largest foreign investors in Russia, and Browder amassed millions through his management of the fund. In both 2006 and 2007, he earned an estimated ¬£125‚Äì150 million. In March 2013, HSBC, a bank that serves as the trustee and manager of Hermitage Capital Management, announced that it would end the fund's operations in Russia. The decision was taken amid two legal cases against Browder: a libel court case in London and a trial in absentia for tax evasion in Moscow. In June 2018, HSBC reached a settlement with the Russian government to pay a ¬£17 million fine to Russian authorities for its part in alleged tax avoidance. Conflict with Russian government In 2005, after ten years of business deals in Russia, Browder was blacklisted by the Russian government as a \\"threat to national security\\" and denied entry to the country. The Economist wrote that the Russian government blacklisted Browder because he interfered with the flow of money to \\"corrupt bureaucrats and their businessmen accomplices\\". Other experts on the activities of Western \\"investors\\" in Russia in the 1990s were more sympathetic to the Russian government's assessment, citing Browder's earlier settlement agreement with Avisma, which seemed to indicate a long-standing habit of siphoning off funds to offshore accounts. He also had been found guilty of evading some $40 million in taxes by using fake deductions. Browder had earlier supported Russian president Vladimir Putin. As reported in 2008 by The New York Times, \\"over the next two years (according to Browder) several of his associates and lawyers, as well as their relatives, became victims of crimes, including severe beatings and robberies during which documents were taken\\". In June 2007, dozens of police officers \\"swooped down on the Moscow offices of Hermitage and its law firm, confiscating documents and computers. When a member of the firm protested that the search was illegal, he was beaten by officers and hospitalized for two weeks, said the firm's head, Jamison R. Firestone.\\" Hermitage became \\"victim of what is known in Russia as 'corporate raiding': seizing companies and other assets with the aid of corrupt law enforcement officials and judges\\". Three Hermitage holding companies were seized on what the company's lawyers insist were bogus charges. The raids in June 2007 allegedly enabled corrupt law enforcement officers to steal the corporate registration documents of three Hermitage holding companies. They allegedly perpetrated a fraud, claiming (and receiving) a rebate of $230 million in taxes paid by those companies to the Russian state in 2006. In November 2008, one of Hermitage's auditors, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested. He was \\"charged with two counts of aggravated tax evasion committed in conspiracy with Mr Browder in respect of Dalnyaya Step and Saturn\\" (ECHR ¬ß 35). Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009 in prison, after eleven months in pretrial detention, nearly the limit allowed under the law. On August 27, 2019, the European Court for Human Rights, in judging a case brought against Russia by the Magnitsky family, ruled that Magnitsky was detained in conditions which amounted to \\"inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention\\" (¬ß 193). This, combined with negligence, lack of adequate medical care and ill-treatment also amounted to a breach of the convention (¬ß 240). Magnitsky's family was awarded ‚Ç¨34,000. As a result of the controversy related to his arrest and evidence of mistreatment and claimed abuse, his death aroused international coverage and outrage. Magnitsky's death was the catalyst for passage by the U.S. Congress, of the Magnitsky Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. The act directly targeted individuals involved in the Magnitsky affair by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system. In February 2013, Russian officials announced that Browder and Magnitsky would both be tried for evading $16.8 million in taxes. In March 2013, Russian authorities announced that they would be investigating Hermitage's acquisition of Gazprom shares worth $70 million. The investigation was to focus on whether Browder violated any Russian laws when Hermitage used Russian companies registered in the region of Kalmykia to buy shares. An investigation by the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights cleared Browder of the accusations of improprieties that surfaced at this time. Browder was also charged with trying to gain access to Gazprom's financial reports. Browder speaks to the protesters in front of the Russian Consulate in Toronto in March 2016 Browder admitted having sought influence in Gazprom, but denied any wrongdoing. He said that purchasing Gazprom shares was an investment in the Russian economy, and the desire to influence the Gazprom management was driven by the need to expose a \\"huge fraud going on at the company\\". However, at the time it was illegal for foreigners to buy Gazprom shares in Russia, and he did it through shell companies that hid his ownership. He also said that the scheme of using Russian-registered subsidiaries entitled to tax advantages was practised by other foreign investors at the time and was not illegal. He also said that he believed the trial was a response to the United States passing the Magnitsky Act, which had blacklisted Russian officials involved in Magnitsky's death, preventing them from entering the U.S. The Financial Times reported that this trial was the first in Russian history that included a dead defendant. Amnesty International described the trial as \\"a whole new chapter in Russia's worsening human rights record\\" and a \\"sinister attempt to deflect attention from those who committed the crimes Magnitsky exposed\\". On July 11, 2013, Browder was convicted in absentia by a district criminal court in Moscow on charges under article 199 of the RF Criminal Code (tax-evasion by organisations), and sentenced to nine years. Magnitsky, according to Browder, was posthumously convicted of fraud.\\"Russia finds Magnitsky posthumously guilty of fraud\\" . BBC News. July 11, 2013.

In May 2013 and again in July 2013, Interpol rejected requests by Russia's Interior Ministry to put Browder on its search list and locate and arrest him, saying that Russia's case against him was \\"predominantly political\\". In April 2014, the European Parliament unanimously passed a resolution to impose sanctions on more than 30 Russians complicit in the Magnitsky case; the first time in the parliament's history that a vote was held to establish a public sanctions list. However, the vote was only advisory to the European Commission, which did not act on it. In December 2017, Browder was tried in absentia and convicted of tax evasion and deliberate bankruptcy by a Russian court, receiving a sentence of nine years of imprisonment. On May 30, 2018, Browder was arrested by Spanish police in Madrid on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. He was freed soon after, when the General Secretary of Interpol warned the Spanish police not to follow the Russian arrest warrant. Browder had come to Spain to brief anti-mafia prosecutor Jos√© Grinda. After briefing him, Browder returned to the United Kingdom later that evening. In November 2018, Russian prosecutors announced new charges against Browder, accusing him of organising a \\"transnational criminal group\\" and claimed he may have poisoned Sergei Magnitsky.  2017 testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee  On July 27, 2017, Browder testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in regards to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and Fusion GPS. The latter is the opposition research firm based in Washington D.C. that commissioned former MI6 staffer Christopher Steele to collect information on Donald Trump's ties with Russia. The hearing was set up to examine the firm's separate work on a legal case involving the Magnitsky Act. He directly discussed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Browder testified that President Putin is \\"the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world\\", building a fortune by threatening Russian oligarchs and getting a 50% cut of their profits: > I estimate that he has accumulated $200 billion of ill-gotten gains from > these types of operations over his 17 years in power. He keeps his money in > the West and all of his money in the West is potentially exposed to asset > freezes and confiscation. Therefore, he has a significant and very personal > interest in finding a way to get rid of the Magnitsky sanctions. Browder concluded his statement by reviewing the circumstances that led to U.S. passage of the Magnitsky Act: > I hope that my story will help you understand the methods of Russian > operatives in Washington and how they use U.S. enablers to achieve major > foreign policy goals without disclosing those interests. I also hope that > this story and others like it may lead to a change in the FARA enforcement > regime in the future.  Book about experiences in Russia  In February 2015, Browder published a book about his career, Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice, focusing on his years spent in Russia and the Russian government's attacks on Hermitage Capital Management. Browder's responses to Russian corruption and his support of the investigation into the death of his attorney Sergei Magnitsky are at the heart of the book. A film adaptation written by William Nicholson was reportedly in the works in 2015. Prevezon civil asset forfeiture case In 2013, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York's Southern District filed a civil asset forfeiture case against Prevezon Holdings Limited, a real estate holding company belonging to Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, based on information from Browder. Prevezon and the Department of Justice settled the case in May 2017 for $5.9 million. Pursuant to a subpoena, Browder gave deposition testimony in the case. Awards and recognition Browder has been the recipient of dozens of awards and recognitions. Some of the most significant are listed below. In 2017, GQ magazine named Browder one of its Men of the Year for standing up to Vladimir Putin. In 2018, Browder was named the 67th most powerful person in the world by Worth magazine. The magazine noted, \\"Browder has become one of the biggest thorns in Putin's side‚Äîand appears to be a key reason Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\" Browder's interview with Preet Bharara on the Stay Tuned with Preet podcast received the People's Choice Webby Award for Best Individual Podcast. In 2018, Browder received the Aspen Institute Henry Crown Leadership Award, a prize honoring \\"an outstanding leader whose achievements reflect the high standards of honor, integrity, industry, and philanthropy.\\" In October 2018, Browder received the Coalition for Integrity's Integrity Award for \\"his courageous fight to expose state-sponsored corruption and shine a light on individuals whose wealth is built on wrongdoing, so that they are denied safe havens anywhere in the world.\\" In June 2019, Browder was presented with the American Spirit Award for Citizen Activism at The Common Good Forum & American Spirit Awards. The committee noted Browder's \\"relentless fight against human rights abuses, corruption, and his work spearheading the Magnitsky Act.\\" In September 2019, Browder received the Trinity College (Dublin) SMF award for outstanding contributions to finance. In 2019, Browder received the Lantos Human Rights Prize from the Lantos Foundation for his work as the \\"driving force behind the Magnitsky Sanctions, the most consequential enforcement mechanism of the modern human rights movement.\\" Counterclaims Andrei Nekrasov documentary Browder and others at a 2015 talk hosted by the Hudson Institute A documentary by Andrei Nekrasov, The Magnitsky Act ‚Äì Behind the Scenes (2016), according to The Daily Beast, \\"absolves the Russian government of any responsibility for Magnitsky's death\\" and claims that Browder was behind the $230-million tax-rebate fraud. Several of the key figures interviewed in the movie have declared it mendacious. The Washington Post described it as part of \\"a campaign to discredit Mr. Browder and the Magnitsky Act\\". Some European theater screenings and a television broadcast of the film were canceled after threats of libel suits from Browder. Over Browder's objections, the Newseum in Washington, D.C. held a screening in June 2016 hosted by Seymour Hersh. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA)'s office actively promoted the screening, sending out invitations from the office of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats, which Rohrabacher chairs; he was described by The Daily Beast as \\"a long-standing Russia ally\\". The Washington Post commented in an editorial: \\"The film is a piece of agitprop that mixes fact and fiction to blame Magnitsky for the fraud and absolve Russians of blame for his death.\\" In the summer of 2017, Bill Browder told the United States Senate Judiciary Committee that the individuals involved with arranging the one-time showing of the film should be charged with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Vladimir Putin statement in Helsinki On July 16, 2018, during a joint press conference with President Donald Trump in Helsinki, Finland, Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that Browder had funneled $400 million to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, an effort that he claimed involved members of the U.S. intelligence community who, Putin said, \\"accompanied and guided these transactions.\\" The statement was made after Putin said he would allow special counsel Robert Mueller's team to come to Russia for their investigation‚Äîas long as there was a reciprocal arrangement for Russian intelligence to investigate in the U.S. Putin said: > For instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder, in this particular case. Business > associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia and never > paid any taxes neither in Russia or the United States and yet the money > escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent > [a] huge amount of money, $400,000,000, as a contribution to the campaign of > Hillary Clinton. (Later, the Russian Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office spokesman > Alexander Kurennoy clarified that it was not $400 million, but rather > $400,000.) Well that‚Äôs their personal case. It might have been legal, the > contribution itself but the way the money was earned was illegal. So we have > solid reason to believe that some [US] intelligence officers accompanied and > guided these transactions. So we have an interest in questioning them. The Washington Post and The New York Times rated Putin's claim about the funding \\"false,\\" noting that there is no evidence to substantiate it. Politifact, gave it a \\"pants on fire\\" rating. Bill Browder, in his own article for Time, called the accusation \\"so ludicrous and untrue that it falls into delusion.\\" He maintains that Putin continues to make false allegations against him in response to Browder's involvement with the Magnitsky Act. Browder also says that he is a British citizen and no longer American, therefore Trump would be unable to respond to Putin's request. Der Spiegel articles On November 22, 2019, German news magazine Der Spiegel published an article in which it claimed Browder accusations concerning the \\"Magnitsky Case\\", do not withstand thorough examination. The English version appeared on November 26, 2019. After Browder filed a complaint against this article with chief editorship of Der Spiegel and the German Press Council, Der Spiegel published a further article, releasing its evidence and emphasising its stance on the matter.

Lisbeth Palme was slightly wounded by a second shot. The couple did not have bodyguards with them. Christer Pettersson, who had previously been convicted of manslaughter, was convicted of the murder in 1988 after having been identified as the killer by Mrs Palme. However, on appeal to Svea Court of Appeal, he was acquitted. A petition for a new trial, filed by the prosecutor, was denied by the Supreme Court of Sweden. Pettersson died on 29 September 2004, legally declared not guilty of the Palme assassination. On 10 June 2020, chief prosecutor Krister Petersson, in charge of the investigation, announced his conclusion that Stig Engstr√∂m, also known as the \\"Skandia Man\\", was the most likely suspect. However, as Engstr√∂m died on 26 June 2000, and no further investigative or judicial measures were possible, the investigation was officially closed. Various different theories about the murder have also been proposed. Night of the assassination Olof Palme in the early 1970s Despite being Prime Minister, Palme sought to live as ordinary a life as possible. He would often go out without any bodyguard protection, and the night of his murder was one such occasion. Walking home from the Grand Cinema with his wife Lisbeth Palme on the central Stockholm street of Sveav√§gen, close to midnight on 28 February 1986, the couple was attacked by a lone gunman. Palme was fatally shot in the back at close range at 23:21 CET. A second shot wounded Mrs Palme. Police said that a taxi driver used his mobile radio to raise an alarm, and two girls in a nearby car tried to assist. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital at 00:06 CET on 1 March 1986. The attacker escaped eastwards on Tunnelgatan. Deputy Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson immediately assumed the duties of Prime Minister as the new leader of the Social Democratic Party. Sequence of events Cinema decision Palme's decision to visit the Grand Cinema was made at very short notice. Lisbeth Palme had discussed seeing a film when she was at work during the afternoon, and called her son, M√•rten Palme, at 17:00 to talk about the film at the Grand Cinema. Olof Palme did not hear about the plans until at home, at 18:30, when he met with his wife, by which time Palme had already declined any further personal bodyguard protection from the security service. He talked to his son about the plans on the phone, and they eventually decided to join M√•rten and his girlfriend, who had already purchased tickets for themselves to see the Swedish comedy Br√∂derna Mozart (The Mozart Brothers) by Suzanne Osten. This decision was made about 20:00. The police later searched Palme's apartment, as well as Lisbet's and M√•rten's workplaces, for wire-bugging devices or traces of such equipment, but did not find any.The investigation committee report (1999:88), p. 161\\\\.

At 20:30 the Palmes left their apartment, unescorted, heading for the Gamla stan metro station. Several people witnessed their short walk to the station and, according to the later police investigation, commented on the lack of bodyguards. The couple took the subway train to the R√•dmansgatan station, from where they walked to the Grand Cinema. They met their son and his girlfriend just outside the cinema around 21:00. Olof Palme had not yet purchased tickets which were by then almost sold out. Recognizing the prime minister, the ticket clerk wanted him to have the best seats, and therefore sold Palme the theatre director's seats.The investigation committee report (1999:88), p. 162\\\\. (PDF) Murder After the screening, the two couples stayed outside the theatre for a while but separated about 23:15. Olof and Lisbeth Palme headed south on the west side of Sveav√§gen, towards the northern entrance of the H√∂torget metro station. When they reached the Adolf Fredrik Church, they crossed Sveav√§gen and continued on the street's east side. They stopped a moment to look at something in a shop window, then continued past the Dekorima (later Kreatima, now Urban Deli) shop which was then located on the corner of Sveav√§gen and Tunnelgatan. At 23:21, a man appeared from behind, shot Mr. Palme at point-blank range and fired a second shot at Mrs. Palme. The perpetrator then jogged down Tunnelgatan street, up the steps to Malmskillnadsgatan, and continued down David Bagares gata [street], where he was last seen.The investigation committee report (1999:88), p. 159 (PDF) Timeline Thanks to time stamps on the radio chatter in the central dispatch centre, the events immediately after the murder have been determined with a very high precision.The investigation committee report (1999:88), p. 173 (PDF) *23:21:30 ‚Äì Palme and his wife are shot. *23:22:20 ‚Äì A witness calls the 90000 emergency line reporting the murder, but the call is misdirected and the caller is not put through to the police. *23:23:40 ‚Äì A J√§rf√§lla Taxi switchboard operator calls the police dispatch centre to pass on a message from one of its drivers to the effect that someone has been shot at the corner Sveav√§gen and Tunnelgatan. *23:24:00 (approx.) ‚Äì A police patrol, stationed a few hundred meters away, arrives on scene after being alerted by a second taxi driver who heard of the shooting on his taxi radio. *23:24:40 ‚Äì The police are contacted by the emergency dispatch centre concerning the shooting on Sveav√§gen.

Leads from the crime scene The only forensic leads left by the assassin were the two bullets fired, identified as Winchester-Western .357 Magnum 158 grain metal piercing. Both bullets matched the lead fragments found in the clothing of Olof and Lisbeth Palme. Because the weapon was a revolver (which does not automatically eject cartridge cases) there were no cases to recover for ballistic examination ‚Äì only the two bullets recovered from the street. From the bullets' lack of certain characteristic deformations, investigators concluded they had been fired from a barrel no shorter than 10 cm (4 inches); thus the murder weapon would have been a conspicuously large handgun. The singularly most used weapon for this type of ammunition is the Smith & Wesson .357, which is why great efforts were made to locate a weapon of this make.The investigation committee report (1999:88), p. 151-152. (PDF) Throughout the investigation, Swedish police test-fired approximately 500 Magnum revolvers. The investigation placed particular emphasis on tracking down ten Magnum revolvers reported stolen at the time of the murder. Out of these all were located except the Sucksdorff revolver, a weapon stolen from the Stockholm home of Swedish filmmaker Arne Sucksdorff in 1977. The person who stole the weapon was a friend of drug dealer Sigvard \\"Sigge\\" Cedergren, who claimed on his deathbed that he had lent a gun of the same type to Christer Pettersson two months prior to the assassination. Another weapon that has figured prominently in the investigation is the so-called Mockfj√§rd gun. This weapon, a revolver of the type Smith & Wesson Model 28 (\\"Highway Patrolman\\") with .357 Magnum caliber, was first purchased legally by a civilian in the northern Swedish city of Lule√•. The gun, along with 91 metal-piercing bullets, was stolen in a burglary in Haparanda in 1983 and is believed to have been used in the robbery of a post office in Mockfj√§rd, Dalarna that same year. A lead isotope analysis of a bullet fired during the robbery confirmed it to have the same isotopic composition as the bullets retrieved from the assassination crime scene, verifying that the bullets were manufactured at the same time. In the autumn of 2006, Swedish police, acting on a tip communicated to the Expressen newspaper, retrieved a Smith & Wesson .357 revolver from a lake in Dalarna. The gun was determined to be the same one used in the post office robbery in Mockfj√§rd, confirmed by the gun's serial number. The gun was transferred to the National Laboratory of Forensic Science in Link√∂ping for further analysis. However, the laboratory concluded in May 2007 that tests on the gun could not confirm whether it was used in the Palme assassination, as it was too rusty. There were numerous witnesses to the murder, of whom more than 25 came forward to the police. The killer was described by witnesses as a man between 30 and 50 years of age, about 180 (5'11\\") to 185 (6'1\\") centimetres tall, and wearing a dark jacket or coat. Many described him as having walked with a limp or otherwise clumsily, but those testimonies were not given immediately after the murder, only after the arrest of Christer Pettersson. Initially, many witnesses described the killer's movements as smooth, efficient and powerful. No witness was in a position to observe the killer's appearance in any detail. A police sketch of the supposed killer was widely circulated in the media a week after the murder, leading to a massive influx of tips from the public, but it was later determined that the witness on whose statement it was based probably had not seen the actual assailant. No good description of the killer's appearance therefore exists. Witnesses agreed on the killer's escape route.

At the time, a murder under Swedish law was subject to prescription in 25 years. The law was later changed to prevent the Palme case from expiring, and thus the police investigation remained active for 34 years. In February 2020, Krister Petersson, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation, stated that he expected to present a conclusive case and either bring charges or close the investigation within a matter of months. Yugoslavian connection In January 2011 the German magazine Focus cited official German interrogation records in connection with another investigation from 2008 as showing that the assassination had been carried out by an operative of the Yugoslavian security service. \\"The 33-year-old\\" A Swedish extremist, Victor Gunnarsson (labeled in the media 33-√•ringen, \\"the 33-year-old\\"), was soon arrested for the murder but quickly released, after a dispute between the police and prosecuting attorneys. Gunnarsson had connections to various extremist groups, among these the European Workers Party, the Swedish branch of the LaRouche Movement.SOU 2002:87 Rikets s√§kerhet och den personliga integriteten , Swedish Government Official Report, p. 239 Pamphlets hostile to Palme from the party were found in his home outside Stockholm. Christer Pettersson Mugshot of Christer Pettersson In December 1988, almost three years after Palme's death, Christer Pettersson, a criminal, drug user and alcoholic, who had previously been imprisoned for manslaughter, was arrested for the murder of Palme. Picked out by Mrs Palme at a lineup as the killer, Pettersson was tried and convicted of the murder, but was later acquitted on appeal to the court of appeal. Pettersson's appeal succeeded for three main reasons: * Failure of the prosecution to produce the murder weapon; * Lack of a clear motive for the killing; * Doubts about the reliability of Mrs Palme's testimony and \\"extremely gross errors\\" by the police in arranging the lineup (giving her hints about Pettersson's alcohol abuse, and allowing him to look like an alcoholic) Additional evidence against Pettersson surfaced in the late 1990s, mostly coming from various petty criminals who altered their stories but also from a confession made by Pettersson. The chief prosecutor, Agneta Blidberg, considered re-opening the case, but acknowledged that a confession alone would not be sufficient, saying: While the legal case against Pettersson therefore remains closed, the police file on the investigation cannot be closed until both murder weapon and murderer are found. Christer Pettersson died on 29 September 2004, after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage caused by a fall during an epileptic seizure. According to a documentary programme broadcast on Swedish state television channel SVT in February 2006, associates of Pettersson claimed that he had confessed to them his role in the murder, but with the explanation that it was a case of mistaken identity. Allegedly, Pettersson had intended to kill Sigvard Cedergren, a drug dealer who customarily walked along the same street at night and resembled Palme both in appearance and dress. The programme also suggested there was greater police awareness than previously acknowledged because of surveillance of drug activity in the area. The police had several officers in apartments and cars along those few blocks of Sveav√§gen but, 45 minutes before the murder, the police monitoring ceased. In the light of these revelations, Swedish police undertook to review Palme's case and Pettersson's role. In the newspaper Dagens Nyheter of 28 February 2006, other SVT reporters scathingly criticized the documentary, alleging that the film-maker had fabricated a number of statements while omitting other contradictory evidence, in particular his chief source's earlier testimony that could not be reconciled with his claim to have seen the shooting. In the final part of the investigation, and the end report, Pettersson was not much included due to formal legal reasons. The police is according to law not allowed to reopen an investigation of a person found not guilty in trial, unless major new evidence happen to materialise. Enough such new evidence has not come up, so the investigation was after the trial not focused on him, and the final report instead pointed out the \\"Skandia man\\" with even less evidence. South Africa On 21 February 1986 ‚Äî a week before he was murdered ‚Äî Palme made the keynote address to the Swedish People's Parliament Against Apartheid held in Stockholm, attended by hundreds of anti-apartheid sympathizers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the Anti-Apartheid Movement such as Oliver Tambo. In the address, Palme said, \\"Apartheid cannot be reformed, it has to be abolished.\\"Speech made by the Prime Minister. Mr Olof Palme, at the \\"Swedish People's Parliament against Apartheid\\" at Folkets Hus on 21 February 1986 Ten years later, towards the end of September 1996, Colonel Eugene de Kock, a former South African police officer, gave evidence to the Supreme Court in Pretoria, alleging that Palme had been shot and killed because he \\"strongly opposed the apartheid regime and Sweden made substantial contributions to the ANC\\".http://www.kurdistan.org/Washington/southafrica.html De Kock went on to claim he knew the person responsible for Palme's murder. He alleged it was Craig Williamson, a former police colleague and a South African spy. A few days later, former police Captain Dirk Coetzee, who used to work with Williamson, identified Anthony White, a former Rhodesian Selous Scout with links to the South African security services, as Palme's actual murderer.Sweden Vs Apartheid: Putting Morality Ahead of Profit, Abdul Karim Bangura, Ashgate, 2004, page 115 Then a third person, Swedish mercenary Bertil Wedin, living in Northern Cyprus since 1985, was named as the killer by former police Lt. Peter Caselton, who had worked undercover for Williamson. The following month, in October 1996, Swedish police investigators visited South Africa, but were unable to uncover evidence to substantiate de Kock's claims. A book that was published in 2007 suggested that a high-ranking Civil Cooperation Bureau operative, Athol Visser (or 'Ivan the Terrible'), was responsible for planning and carrying out Olof Palme's assassination. The 8 September 2010 edition of Efterlyst, Sweden's equivalent of BBC TV's Crimewatch programme, was co-hosted by Tommy Lindstr√∂m, who was the head of Swedish CID at the time of Olof Palme's assassination. After being asked by Efterlyst's host Hasse Aro who he believed was behind the assassination of the Prime Minister, Lindstr√∂m without hesitating pointed to apartheid South Africa as the number one suspect. And the motive for this, he said, was to stop the payments that the Swedish government secretly paid, through Switzerland, to the African National Congress. Bofors and Indian connection In his 2005 book Blood on the Snow: The Killing of Olof Palme, historian Jan Bondeson advanced a theory that Palme's murder was linked with arms trades to India. Bondeson's book meticulously recreated the assassination and its aftermath, and suggested that Palme had used his friendship with Rajiv Gandhi to secure a SEK 8.4 billion deal for the Swedish armaments company Bofors to supply the Indian Army with howitzers. However, Palme did not know that behind his back Bofors had used a shady company called AE Services ‚Äî nominally based in Guildford, Surrey, England ‚Äî to bribe Indian government officials to conclude the deal ‚Äì the Bofors scandal. Bondeson alleged that on the morning he was assassinated, Palme had met with the Iraqi ambassador to Sweden, Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf. The two discussed Bofors, which al-Sahhaf knew well because of its arms sales during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Bondeson suggested that the ambassador had told Palme about Bofors' activities, infuriating Palme. Bondeson theorized that Palme's murder might have been inadvertently triggered by his conversation with the ambassador, if either the Bofors arms dealers or the middlemen working through AE Services had a prearranged plan to silence the Prime Minister should he discover the truth and the deal with India become threatened. According to Bondeson, Swedish police suppressed vital MI6 intelligence about a Bofors/AE Services deal with India. Roberto Thieme The Swedish journalist Anders Leopold, in his 2008 book Det svenska tr√§det skall f√§llas (\\"The Swedish Tree Shall Be Brought Down\\"), makes the case that the Chilean fascist Roberto Thieme killed Olof Palme. Thieme was head of the most militant wing of Patria y Libertad, a far-right political organization, financed by the US CIA. According to Leopold, Palme was killed because he had gratuitously given asylum to a great number of leftist Chileans following the coup that overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973. Police conspiracy In an article in the German weekly Die Zeit from March 1995, Klaus-Dieter Knapp presented his view of the assassination as a result of a conspiracy among Swedish right-wing extremist police officers. According to this report, the murderer was identified by two witnesses who happened to be at the scene and who knew the murderer from previous encounters. PKK Abdullah √ñcalan, leader of PKK, was accused of involvement in Olof Palme's assassination. In 1971, Olof Palme said that he blamed the fear of the masses on \\"anarchists and people with long hair [and] people with beards.\\" Following up on this suggestion, Hans Holm√©r, the Stockholm police commissioner, worked with an intelligence lead passed to him (supposedly by Bertil Wedin) and arrested a number of Kurds living in Sweden. The PKK was allegedly responsible for the murder. The lead proved inconclusive however and ultimately led to Holm√©r's removal from the Palme murder investigation. Fifteen years later, in April 2001, a team of Swedish police officers went to interview PKK leader Abdullah √ñcalan in Turkish prison about state allegations that a dissident Kurdish group, led by √ñcalan's ex-wife, murdered Palme. The police team's visit proved futile. In 2007, renewed allegations of PKK complicity in Palme's assassination surfaced in Turkish media during the Ergenekon investigation, which was ongoing . The Turkish newspapers have several times claimed that the PKK has admitted the murder but the PKK have always denied all claims. In 1998, the PKK said that there is a strong indication that the Turkish side is trying to discredit the PKK using Olof Palme's murder. Also many Kurdish organizations believe that the initial claims were propaganda of the Turkish government.http://so.firatajans.com/guncel/isvec-palme-cinayeti-icin- kurtlerden-ozur-dilemeli The CIA and P2 connection Another plot sees the involvement of the CIA and the Italian clandestine, pseudo-masonic lodge Propaganda Due led by Licio Gelli who wrote, in a telegram to Philip Guarino, that \\"the Swedish tree will be felled\\".\\"L'albero svedese sar√† abbattuto\\", from a telegram by Licio Gelli to Philip Guarino, from the hearing of Ennio Remondino in the parliamentary inquiry commission about Italian terrorism and the causes behind the unsuccessful identification of the massacre's guilty party, 72nd session, 4 July 2000 (president Giovanni Pellegrino) Claims of CIA involvement in the assassination were made by Richard Brenneke, an Oregon businessman who said he was an ex-CIA operative, in a RAI Television report in July 1990.La Repubblica, 4 July 1990, GELLI E L' AGENTE DELLA CIA LA PAROLA E' AI MAGISTRATI The CIA denied Brenneke's allegations calling them \\"absolute nonsense\\". Given \\"the outrageous nature of his claims\\", the CIA gave a public denial stating: \\"The agency flatly denies that Mr. Brenneke was ever an agent of the CIA or had any association with the CIA.\\" GH A suspect identified only as GH by the Granskningskommissionen of 1999 was of prime interest during the early investigation. This was based on a standard profile used by the police to identify an assassin. The conclusion was that the killer had a knowledge of handling light firearms, used a Smith & Wesson of .357 Magnum, which GH at the time possessed. The suspect was reported to have failed to appear on several police interrogations to testify during the 1990s. Later testimonies given by the suspect were deemed untrustworthy; this included the suspect's whereabouts during the night of the assassination and the disposal of firearms. He refused to submit his gun, the only registered .357 caliber weapon in the Stockholm region not to be tested, and subsequently claimed to have sold it to an unknown buyer in Kungstr√§dg√•rden. GH had on one occasion had his gun license suspended after shooting his television, arguably after seeing Olof Palme's face on the screen. GH has also been convicted for assault, one time for kicking a dog in 1985, and a later incident in 2005 when he assaulted a young man on the metro liner after being harassed. In August 2008, GH committed suicide by gunshot after the police rang his doorbell and requested to be let in after being alerted thru a phone call by his brother. He reportedly suffered from paranoid depressions. The Laser Man  John Ausonius, \\"the Laser Man\\", also known as John Stannerman, was initially one of the suspects but it turned out that Ausonius had a solid alibi, as he was imprisoned on the night Palme was shot. The Skandia man In 2018, journalist and investigator Thomas Petterson published first a series of articles in the Swedish magazine Filter and later a book, Den osannolika m√∂rdaren (\\"The unlikely assassin\\"), based on a long-running investigation into Palme's murder. Petterson's findings were also covered elsewhere in the Swedish media, for example by Expressen and Aftonbladet newspapers. Petterson's theory is that Palme was shot by one Stig Engstr√∂m, known as ‚Äúthe Skandia man\\" (Skandiamannen) after his employer, the Skandia insurance company, whose head office is located next to the murder scene. In earlier accounts Engstr√∂m had been treated mostly as a witness, specifically (by his own assertion) the first eyewitness to arrive at the scene of the murder. He had also been briefly investigated by the police as a possible suspect, but this had subsequently been dropped. Petterson posits a scenario where Engstr√∂m, who had a strong dislike of Palme and his policies, had chanced upon Palme in the street and shot him, possibly without premeditation. Engstr√∂m is dead, having committed suicide in 2000. Petterson suggests that evidence from the crime scene strongly points towards Engstr√∂m as the assassin. Most significantly, several other witnesses gave descriptions of the fleeing killer that matched Engstr√∂m, some of them very closely so, while no other witness placed Engstr√∂m at the scene after the shots, even though Engstr√∂m himself claimed to have been present from the beginning, spoken to Mrs. Palme and the police, and taken part in attempts to resuscitate the victim. Conversely, the only persons whom Engstr√∂m was able to identify as having been present at the scene were those likely to have been encountered by the killer, while he was unable to identify those who had arrived after the shooting. Also, Engstr√∂m's known movements during the evening, about which he provided false information when questioned, indicate he had the opportunity to find Palme at the cinema earlier that evening and later to follow him from there to the crime scene. Soon after the murder, Engstr√∂m began a series of media appearances in which he developed an increasingly detailed story of his involvement in the events and criticized the police. He claimed those witnesses who had described the killer had in fact been describing him, running to catch up with police officers in pursuit of the assassin. The police, meanwhile, became frustrated with Engstr√∂m as an unreliable and inconsistent witness and soon classified him as a person of no interest. Petterson proposes Engstr√∂m's media appearances were an opportunistic and ultimately successful tactic devised to mislead investigators and later to gain attention as an important witness neglected by the police. While Petterson's theory is built on circumstantial evidence, he suggests it might be possible to prove Engstr√∂m's guilt conclusively by tracing and examining the murder weapon. According to Petterson's theory, the revolver was likely to have been one legally owned by an acquaintance of Engstr√∂m's, an avid gun collector. The \\"Skandia man\\" theory had already previously been suggested by Lars Larsson in his 2016 book Nationens fiende (literally, \\"The enemy of the nation\\"), but this received only limited attention at the time. On 10 June 2020, the Swedish Prosecution Authority proposed The Skandia Man as the perpetrator and closed off the investigation since Engstr√∂m is dead and can thus not be prosecuted, while noting the lack of technical evidence. Although Engstr√∂m had a negative view of the prime minister, as well as long-standing financial and growing alcohol problems, investigators still did not have a \\"clear picture\\" of Engstrom's motive for killing Palme, Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson said.

The Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes (, ), commonly referred to by its acronym YSEE, is a non-profit Hellenic organisation established in Greece in 1997. Its primary goal is the protection and restoration of the Hellenic ethnic religion in contemporary Greek society. The group itself estimates that some 2,000 Greeks practice the Hellenic ethnic religion and another 100,000 have \\"some sort of interest\\". The followers of the Hellenic ethnic religion face varying degrees of discrimination in Greece, which has an overwhelmingly Orthodox Christian population. One of YSEE's main goals is to obtain legal recognition for the Hellenic ethnic religion. YSEE is a founding member of the European Congress of Ethnic Religions (ECER) and hosted its seventh Congress in June 2004. YSEE has also been member of the European Union's action program to combat discrimination. Outside of Greece In 2007, members of YSEE in the United States founded the Hellenic Council YSEE of America which is now a recognized non-for profit organization based in Astoria, a New York City neighborhood with a large Greek-American community. Principles The Gods have emerged from the ‚ÄúTrue Being‚Äù as a simple multiplication of itself into separate entities, and for this reason, they retain all its qualities, which are immortality, infinity, and knowledge. The mission of the Gods is the establishment and maintenance of the unity and the order of the Cosmos. Thus the true Gods are perfect beings that impose order and possess immortality and knowledge. They infuse the world without any obstructions by acting on it. They are subject to the natural laws that they serve, and they partake in the eternal rebirth and continuous synthesis and decomposition of the forms. As to their nature, the true and natural Gods are perfect, virtuous, immortal, unchangeable, infinite, just, all-wise, eternal, non-personal, without gender, unifying, ethereal and permeate all matter.Hellenic Council YSEE of America. (2018). Hellenic Ethnic Religion: Theology and Practice. Practices  Altars  The Hellenic Ethnic Religion performs its ritual on altars and hearths, depending on the nature of the deities worshiped at the time. For the Olympian gods, altars are used, which are sanctified surfaces raised above the ground. For chthonic deities and ancestral spirits, we use hearths, which are sanctified surfaces on the ground or in pits. In Hellenic Ethnic Religion, the altar is the most sacred point, the adobe of a Deity, ‚Äúwhere the altars are, that is where the Gods are.\\" Because of their nature the altars are points of refuge (asylum) and whoever touches them is considered invulnerable as if he was ‚Äúholding the hand of the Gods‚Äù.Hellenic Council YSEE of America. (2018). Hellenic Ethnic Religion: Theology and Practice.  Statues  The only thing that can be equated in holiness with the altar for Hellenes is the sacred statue (Grk. ŒÜŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒºŒ±). A statue is every sculpted or other (even natural) pleasing form which is defined as the icon or symbol of the deity. Either natural, (for example, unworked stones, meteorite etc.) or worked by human hand (sculpted or casted) and of any material (marble, wood, common or precious metal, clay, etc.) for a statue to be ‚Äúraised‚Äù to devotional it must first be sanctified in a special ritual. After the sanctification which is also called ‚Äúopening of the eyes‚Äù, the statue is now the adobe of Divinity, like the altar, and thus it requires respectful handling.

It is named after the large Franzensfeste Fortress erected from 1833 to 1838 and is also known as an important railway hub. Geography Wipptal at Franzensfeste Franzensfeste is located in the southern Wipptal valley on the Eisack river, about south of Sterzing and north of Brixen. The settlement is situated on the western side of the valley, at the Sachsenklemme narrow where it is only a few hundred meters wide, along with the Brenner Railway line and the state road SS12 while the Autostrada A22 (Brenner Highway), running elevated on the same side, pass through the lake in its northern part entering a tunnel on the opposite side; the state road cross than the Eisack river nearby the railway station due north. The valley is confined by the Zillertal Alps in the northeast and the Sarntal Alps in the southwest, rising up to the Tagewaldhorn peak at .  History  Origin Franzensfeste was founded recently. The village dates from the 19th century when the construction of the fortifications was begun, to which the site is also closely linked in name (into Italian language), and the railway. The parish was originally Mittewald, still the common land, with the two villages of Oberau and Unterau. Archeological findings have shown the area to be settled by 2500 B.C. as indicated by the finding of home pottery. The Wipptal has always played an important role in the transit of goods on the north-south bound, first as the Amber Road between Greece, Sicily and Northern Europe later in the Roman period, between Aquileia and the regions beyond the Alps; also a long stretch of the Roman Via Claudia Augusta has been unearthed. Gemeinde Franzensfeste: The Roman road In the 17th century, where the station is now placed, there were a few farms, one of which, was turned into an inn with the name \\"Post- Reifer\\". It is still in operation today. Fortress The military importance of the place became evident during the Tyrolean Rebellion in 1809 when General Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre, commander of 2500 Royal Saxon troopers, was defeated in an ambush by Andreas Hofer‚Äôs Tyrolean insurgents at the narrow which later was called Sachsenklemme (\\"Gorge of the Saxons‚Äù). In the 1830s Emperor Francis I of Austria wanted to build a defensive system on the strategic important Brenner route, for fear of an invasion from the south; the village was settled for strategic purposes; it is well protected by the surrounding mountainous and can block the entrance to the Eisack valley. Work began on June 17, 1833, and the Franzensfeste Fortress was inaugurated by Franz' successor Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria on August 18, 1838. The construction of the fortress and later of the Brenner railway, helped thousands of workers who found accommodation in Franzensfeste contributing to the development and growth of the village. Franzensfeste station In 1867 with the opening of the Brenner railway line, Franzensfeste consolidated its role as a transport hub not only on the north-south direction, but also with the eastern branch-off into the Puster Valley, to Carinthia and the Austrian Southern Railway line at Maribor in Styria, opened in 1871. The Franzensfeste Fortress, however, lost its strategic importance with the signing of the Triple Alliance military agreement by Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy in 1882. The fortifications were transformed into a military ammunition depot, which kept even when was transferred to Italy according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain. In 1939 began the construction of the hydroelectric basin for the power plant in Brixen made necessary for the electrification of the railway; the work was completed the following year and the village of Unterau was flooded. Franzensfeste in 1940 was elevated to municipality, became an important railway junction and the infrastructure for the maintenance of the locomotives and housing the staff were built. Geschichte Tirol Until the 1990s Franzensfeste was an important customs goods- station for cattle, but with the entry of Austria in the European Community has lost importance. In the summer of 2008 the fortress of Franzenfeste was opened to the public for the first time as one of the locations of Manifesta 7, the European Biennial of Contemporary art. In 2009 the location hosted the so-called \\"Landesausstellung\\", an event remembering the Bicentenaire of the Tyrolean riots in 1809. Coat-of-arms The emblem of Fortress consists of an argent inverted upsilon symbolizing the roads to the village. The gules area, on top left, symbolizes the rock; the azure, top right, the lake and the vert the meadows. The emblem was adopted in 1968.

It is the byproduct of protectionism. However, the term is controversial because what one part may see as a trade restriction another may see as a way to protect consumers from inferior, harmful or dangerous products.  Examples  German purity laws: Beer Germany required the production of beer to adhere to its purity law. The law, originally implemented in Bavaria in 1516 and eventually becoming law for newly unified Germany in 1871, made many foreign beers unable to be sold in Germany as \\"beer\\". This law was struck down in 1987 by the European Court of Justice, but is still voluntarily followed by many German breweries. US motor vehicle headlamps Rectangular headlamps were promoted in the United States where round lamps were required until 1975. By 1979, the majority of new cars now had the rectangular headlamps. Again, the US permitted only two standardized sizes of rectangular sealed-beam lamp: A system of two 200 mm x 142 mm high/low beam units corresponding to the existing 7\\" round format, or a system of four 165 mm x 100 mm units (two high/low and two high-beam) corresponding to the existing 5¬æ inch (146 mm) round format. In 1968, the US Department of Transportation outlawed any decorative or protective element in front of the headlamps if the headlamps are switched on. Glass-covered headlamps, like those used on the Jaguar E-Type, the pre-1968 VW Beetle, the Porsche 356, the Citro√´n DS and Ferrari Daytona, now had to be equipped with uncovered headlamps for the US market, further altering the look of European models sold in the United States. The change meant that vehicles designed for solid aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market. In 1984, the Department changed the rule to allow replaceable-bulb headlamps of nonstandard shapes. However, some automaker could equip a vehicle with the same type of headlamps in the US as in the rest of the world. US headlamp standards are governed by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which is incompatible with the UNECE standards, used in most of the rest of the world. Canada has its own headlamp standards that are similar to the US standard but allows UNECE-compliant headlamps. Headlamps were used in cars but also for traffic violation stops.

Later that month, Brittany Ferries then announced three intentions; To fit scrubbers to a number of older vessels, to convert newer vessels to LNG, and to construct a new LNG powered ferry. Later, Brittany Ferries withdrew and cancelled the order for a new LNG- powered ferry and for the LNG conversions, and instead announced that all vessels were to have scrubbers systems fitted. Accordingly, Normandie was fitted with a scrubber in October 2015. In the same dry dock visit, improvements were made to her public areas.

In late 2016, Brittany Ferries signed a letter of intent with Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft for a new cruise ferry between Portsmouth-Caen to be delivered in 2019. The new vessel, Honfleur, will result in a fleet movement with Normandie assigned to the Portsouth-Le Havre service from late 2019. In June 2020 Brittany Ferries announced the cancellation of the Honfleur contract with the Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard in Germany meaning Normandie will remain in the Portsmouth-Caen route.

Chief Operating Officer is Ivan Cherkasov. Hermitage Capital Management headquarters are in Guernsey, it also maintains offices in the Cayman Islands, London and Moscow.Hermitage Capital Management Company Profile. LinkedIn Overview. Accessed 2010-04-23. Its main investment fund, the Hermitage Fund created in 1996, was rated as extremely successful after earning 2,697% between 1996 and December 2007. Hermitage describe themselves as an activist fund. Its main tactics include the exposure of corporate corruption in the companies it is holding, in the hope of improving managerial behaviour and lessen the significant discount that corruption has on share prices. Most famously, Hermitage has helped to expose several high-profile cases of corruption in Russia's largest company Gazprom between 1998 and 2000. In October 2000, Hermitage reported that \\"investors are valuing this company as if 99 percent of its assets have been stolen. The real figure is around 10 percent so that's good news.\\"\\"Gazprom and Hermitage Capital: Shareholder Activism in Russia\\", Stanford Graduate School of Business Case IB-36, 2002 In April 2007, the firm launched Hermitage Global, an activist fund focused on global emerging markets. Since 2015, Hermitage has operated as a family office hedge fund based in London, having returned outside capital to investors. The focus of the fund is still in emerging markets. Conflict with Russian government  Although the fund's founder William Browder was a supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin, in November 2005 he was blacklisted by the Russian government as a \\"threat to national security\\" and denied entry to the country. According to publication in The Economist, the fund was blacklisted because its management interfered with the flow of money to \\"corrupt bureaucrats and their businessmen accomplices\\" in Russia. In April 2008 because three of Hermitage Capital's subsidiaries had been placed under control of Boily Systems, which is a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company that CTL established in 2007 for G.S.L. Law & Consulting which is a firm in Russia, Hermitage Capital Management sent a letter to Commonwealth Trust Limited (CTL) claiming that thieves had taken control of Hermitage's three subsidiaries. One of the companies, Diron Trade LLP, a stolen Magnitsky company with a Great Britain postal box, assisted in more than $5.8 billion in money laundering transfers between Swedbank's baltic subsidiaries and Danske Bank during 6 months in 2010 and 2011 according to SVT. As the New York Times reported in 2008, over the next two years, several of his associates and lawyers, as well as their relatives, were victims of crimes, including severe beatings and robberies during which documents were taken. In June 2007 dozens of police officers raided the Moscow offices of Hermitage and its law firm, confiscating documents and computers. When a member of the firm protested that the search was illegal, he was beaten by officers and hospitalized for two weeks. Hermitage became victim of what is known in Russia as \\"corporate raiding\\": seizing companies and other assets with the aid of corrupt law enforcement officials and judges. Three Hermitage holdings companies were seized on what the company's lawyers insist are bogus charges. On 8 October, 2008 Hermitage released a video on YouTube accusing Russian Police of fraud. On November 16, 2009 Sergei Magnitsky, a partner of the legal company Firestone Duncan, who was a representative and legal consultant for William Browder in Moscow, having been accused in tax fraud and imprisoned for 11 months, died in prison. In 2013 it was announced that Magnitsky will go on trial posthumously. Opalesque.TV released a video on February 8, 2010 in which Browder reveals details of Sergey Magnitsky's ordeal during his eleven months in detention. In 2012 Hermitage filed a complaint with Cyprus anti-corruption agency Mokas regarding $31m funds illegally moved from Russia through a chain banks in Cyprus. However, in 2015 Cyprus police passed the documents to Russian investigators in the alleged tax-evasion case of Magnitsky and Browder, widely described as a set-up. In 2013, Hermitage closed its Russian fund which in 2005, had over $4 billion in assets under management. In 2013, the fund was evaluated as having less than $60 million in assets. Closing the fund led to a dispute between investors and HSBC which was a manager and trustee of the fund. In December 2017, Browder and Cherkasov were sentenced in absentia to 9 and 8 years of imprisonment respectively by a Russian court for tax evasion by Hermitage Capital Management and causing $58million of damage to the Russian federal budget. In April 2018, Natalia Veselnitskaya announced that on behalf of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation, she was investigating Bill Browder and Hermitage Capital, but denied working for the Kremlin. In May 2018, Bill Browder praised the Magnitsky amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act released in the United States calling for ‚Äúswift and robust action‚Äù adding that ‚Äútop Putin oligarchs should be on that list‚Äù. Also in May, Browder was briefly detained in Spain when a Russian arrest warrant for extradition placed him on Interpol‚Äôs Red Notice.

In 1984, Gold Circle was notable as the first major discounter to implement chain wide UPC barcode scanning in an effort to reduce checkout time for shoppers and improve inventory accuracy and speed store merchandise replenishment. Merge with Richway In 1986, Federated merged its Gold Circle division with its Richway Department Stores, another Federated discount division. While the chains each continued to operate under their original names (though several Richways were converted to Gold Circles), buying and other administrative functions for both were consolidated into Gold Circle's Worthington, Ohio headquarters. Liquidation After Campeau Corporation acquired Federated Department Stores in 1988, Gold Circle was liquidated along with Richway (in addition to the sale or liquidation of several other under-performing Federated divisions). The chain was dismantled in late 1988 with Kimco Development acquiring all of the store locations while the corporate office and distribution center were sold off in separate transactions. Hills leased 35 Gold Circle stores in Ohio, New York, and Kentucky and immediately converted them into Hills stores following the liquidation sales, reopening early in 1989. Some of the Gold Circle stores became Hills Department Stores or Target, while Springfield and Elyria, Ohio, became Kmart.

It formed after the last ice age and has gradually shrunk to its current size of 1.7 hectares (4.2 acres). Bog lakes like Lake Wilkie are a rare ecosystem in this part of the country. Formation Lake Wilkie was formed after the most recent ice age about 13,000 years ago. Trapped towards the coast by a small cliff, water accumulated in a depression between ancient sand dunes. Originally, the lake was much larger and is slowly being filled in and reclaimed by the vegetation around it. Today, the lake is very shallow and its water colored brownish by organic acids released by the peaty soils.Department of Conservation NZ information panel along walking track Fauna and flora The lake is home to only microscopic plankton and small invertebrates such as mites, molluscs, water boatman and worms. No fish have been found in the lake; although native galaxias are a possibility. The introduced whistling tree frog is common around the lake's edges. A cafe along the road west from Lake Wilkie shares the same name of \\"The Whistling Frog Cafe & Bar\\". Birds common in the forest around the lake include kerer≈´, tui, silvereye, fantail, bellbird, brown creeper and grey warbler. Fernbirds and ducks from the nearby Tautuku Estuary regularly visit Lake Wilkie.Forest & Bird information panel along walking track The lake is only a short walk from a small car park on the Southern Scenic Route road, about south of Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre. A walking track starts through mature podocarp forest, including rata and leads past a viewpoint over the lake and down to the lake. At the lake margin, a short loop track with a boardwalk section takes in the boggy wetland on the lake's edge. Along the track are several signs explaining the succession of different plants as land is slowly reclaimed. The full transition from marsh dominated by sphagnum moss and sedges to mature podocarp forest occurs in only 65 m (210 ft). This shows how waterside plants can slowly reclaim the land, and in turn be replaced by larger and larger vegetation types, culminating in the forest now covering the ancient dunes around the lake.

It is a parody of the French feature-length nature documentary March of the Penguins (2005), directed and co written by Luc Jacquet. The film features Samuel L. Jackson as narrator, with the two main characters voiced by Bob Saget and Lewis Black. Five of Saget's former Full House co stars also lent their voices to the film. Additional voices were provided by Tracy Morgan, Christina Applegate, James Belushi, Whoopi Goldberg, Dane Cook, Abe Vigoda, Mo'Nique, David Koechner, Jamie Kennedy, Harvey Fierstein, Alyson Hannigan, and others. Synopsis Samuel L. Jackson narrates the story about a group of male penguins that make a seventy mile trek to go to their breeding grounds, where females are waiting to have sex with them. These penguins include Carl (Bob Saget) and Jimmy (Lewis Black), two friends who talk about relationships and other things as they meet new characters including Marcus (Tracy Morgan), a penguin who likes to kid around and brag about his huge penis (an illogical point, since penguins do not have penises, and instead have cloacas), and Steve the snowy owl (Jonathan Katz), who gives Carl advice on his life in a Freudian kind of way while billing him for the two quick sessions. Meanwhile, Melissa (Christina Applegate) and Vicky (Mo'Nique) argue about men and other women who bother them as they wait for their mates to arrive at the breeding grounds. Cast * Samuel L.

They are found worldwide, outside of the Arctic and Subantarctic, in the mesopelagic zone below a depth of . This genus once contained three nominal species: M. niger (the type), M. choristodactylus, and M. danae, with the validity of the latter two species being challenged by different authors at various times. In 2007, Kenaley examined over 450 stoplight loosejaw specimens and revised the genus to contain two species, M. niger and the new M. australis. Malacosteus and the related genera Aristostomias, Chirostomias and Pachystomias are the only fishes that produce red bioluminescence. As most of their prey organisms are not capable of perceiving light at those wavelengths, this allows Malacosteus to hunt with an essentially invisible beam of light. Furthermore, Malacosteus is unique amongst animals in using a chlorophyll derivative to perceive red light. The name Malacosteus is derived from the Greek malakos meaning \\"soft\\" and osteon meaning \\"bone\\". Another common name for these fishes is \\"rat-trap fish\\", from the unusual open structure of their jaws. Species There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Malacosteus australis Kenaley, 2007 (Southern stoplight loosejaw) * Malacosteus niger Ayres, 1848 (Stoplight loosejaw) Distribution and habitat These fishes have a wide distribution in all oceans: M. niger is found between 66¬∞ N and 33¬∞ S, except for the Mediterranean Sea, while M. australis is found in the southern transition zone between 25¬∞ to 45¬∞ S, where it is bound by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. M. niger appears to be replaced by M. australis south of 30¬∞ S, while M. australis does not occur north of that latitude outside of the Indian Ocean and the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Both species are usually found below a depth of in midwater. They are the only known stomiids that do not seem to conduct significant diel vertical migrations. Description Malacosteus has an elongated body with short, blunt snouts and large eyes that face forward, granting binocular vision. Unlike other stomiids, it has a single round nostril on each side in front of the eye. Relative to its size, Malacosteus has one of the widest gapes of any fish, with a lower jaw measuring one-quarter of the fish's length. The lower jaw has no ethmoid membrane (floor) and is attached only by the hinge and a modified tongue bone. There are several large, fang-like teeth in the front of the jaws, followed by many small barbed teeth. There are several groups of pharyngeal teeth that serve to direct food down the esophagus. The pectoral and pelvic fins are moderately long, containing 3-4 and 6 fin rays respectively. The dorsal and anal fins are placed far back on the body and contain 18-20 and 19-22 rays respectively. The caudal fin is small, with the lower lobe larger than the upper. There are three bioluminescent photophores near the eyes: beneath the eye is a large, teardrop-shaped suborbital photophore that emits red light. Behind it is an ovoid postorbital photophore that emits green light; this photophore is larger in males than females. These red and green photophores are evocative of traffic lights, hence the fish's common name. The third is tiny and round, located between the eye and the large red photophore. Several rows and clusters of blue photophores are present on the sides and belly. In addition, there are small photophores and accessory areas of white luminous tissue scattered over the head and body. The skin is thin and scaleless; the coloration is black. Biology and ecology Malacosteus is thought to use its suborbital photophores like searchlights to find prey. As long wavelengths of light (i.e. red) do not reach the deep sea from the surface, many deep-sea organisms are insensitive to red wavelengths, and so to these creatures red- colored objects appear black. The red photophore of Malacosteus thus allows it to illuminate prey without being detected. These fishes exhibit a number of adaptations for feeding on large prey. The \\"open\\" structure of its jaws reduces water resistance, allowing them to be snapped shut more quickly, while large recurved teeth and powerful jaw closing muscles assure a secure hold on prey items. The connection between the head and the body is reduced, with unossified vertebrae, allowing the cranium to be tilted back and the jaws thrust forward for a wider gape. Finally, the gills are exposed to the outside, allowing the fish to continue respiring while slowly swallowing large prey. However, contrary to its apparent morphological specialization, the diet of Malacosteus consists primarily of zooplankton, chiefly large calanoid copepods, with smaller numbers of krill, shrimps, and fishes. It is yet unclear how Malacosteus captures such small planktonic prey given the open structure of its mouth. The unexpected diet of Malacosteus is theorized to be a result of the small volumes that it searches for food, in which large prey items are rare. The rapid attenuation of red light in sea water gives Malacosteus a shorter visual range than species that use blue light, and it does not migrate vertically into more productive waters like other stomiids. Therefore, its strategy may be one of \\"snacking\\" on copepods, which are three orders of magnitude more abundant than fishes at its native depths, in between larger meals. The red photophore of Malacosteus. The other factor believed to be partly responsible for Malacosteus' diet is its unique visual system, which uses a derivative of chlorophyll as a photosensitizer that absorbs long-wave light (around 700 nm) and then indirectly stimulates the fish's two visual pigments, which have maximum absorbances at only 520 and 540 nm. No vertebrates are known to synthesize chlorophyll derivatives, and Malacosteus is believed to obtain these derivatives from the copepods it consumes. The red photophore of Malacosteus consists of a pigmented sac with a reflective inner lining and an internal mass of gland cells. Inside the gland cells, blue-green light is produced via the same chemical reaction found in other stomiids, which is then absorbed by a protein that fluoresces in a broad red band. This light is then reflected out through the photophore apterture, where it passes through a brown filter, yielding a far-red light with a maximum absorbance at 708 nm (almost infrared). In live fish, the suborbital and postorbital photophores both flash vigorously, the suborbital at a slower rate.

Downloaded on 20 February 2016. It lives in oceans around the world from tropical to subarctic waters. Flashing of photophores of Malacosteus niger, showing red fluorescence modifying the bioluminescence The postorbital photophore in this species is larger than in M. australis. It also differs in lateral photophore count, as well as in morphological characters. The maximum known length is 25.6 cm (10.1 in). Its specific epithet niger is Latin for \\"black\\". M. niger occurs in the mesopelagic zone of all oceans. Contrary to barbeled dragonfishes in general, it is not a vertical migrator. While the morphology of M. niger with huge fangs and an enormous gape is typical for its family and suggests adaptations to piscivory, its diet in fact contains a substantial proportion of zooplankton. It is suggested that its dominant feeding mode is searching for zooplanktonic prey (copepods in particular) using bioluminescence to illuminate a small search area, with infrequent encounters with larger prey items. The likely origin of the pigment necessary for detecting its long wavelength bioluminescence, a chlorophyll derivative, is the copepods themselves.

The Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) began recognizing it as a title event in 1998, and it was designated one of the four majors in 2000. A PBA rule change in 2008 retroactively awarded a PBA title (and a major) to any Masters winners prior to 1998 who were PBA members at the time of the victory. History The tournament began in 1951 as the ABC Masters, conducted by the American Bowling Congress (ABC). The ABC merged with the WIBC and YABA to become the USBC in 2005, after which the tournament was renamed USBC Masters. The Masters began as an invitational event showcasing national and local bowling stars and has grown to become one of bowling's most prestigious events. While the event has evolved over the years, its trademark qualifying and double-elimination match play format has remained largely unchanged. All bowlers compete in 15 games of qualifying, with the top 63 qualifiers joining the previous year's champion in the double elimination match play bracket. All head-to-head matches consist of 3 games, highest total pinfall wins.Official USBC Masters \\"Information\\" web page Hundreds of competitors turn out for the Masters each year (a full field of 360 entered the 2018 event) with their sights set on a prize fund that has recently been as high as $350,000, including a $50,000 top prize.\\"New formats for new era.\\" Article at www.pba.com, August 4, 2008. The field, which now includes women, also features representatives from all 50 states and a handful of foreign countries. The Masters is open to PBA members and any USBC member that meets average requirements, and is a part of the World Bowling Tour. After the Masters in January 2004, the tournament was moved to the fall, resulting in two Masters events during calendar year 2004. (The first was part of the 2003‚Äì04 PBA season, and the second was part of the 2004‚Äì05 season.) Then in 2008, the tournament was moved back to the spring, which is why there was no Masters during 2008. Mike Aulby is the first player to have won the USBC Masters three times, but was eventually passed by Jason Belmonte. Belmonte is the only player to win three Masters in a row (2013, 2014 and 2015), and he won again in 2017 to become the only player to win four Masters titles. Walter Ray Williams Jr. is the oldest person to win the USBC Masters, capturing the 2010 event at age 50. In 2016, Anthony Simonsen, aged 19 years and 39 days, became the tournament's youngest winner, as well as the youngest to win a PBA major of any kind. Current defending champion 2019 Event The 2019 USBC Masters was held at the Gold Coast Bowling Center in Las Vegas, Nevada from March 27 to April 1. The tournament had a starting field of 450 bowlers, and used a five-player stepladder finals format.

Most workshops are open to youth, and many are open to tweens and children. Safety & rules The PSG registration process includes agreeing to abide by rules set down by Circle Sanctuary, mostly for the safety and health of the participants. Some rules, such as those regarding alcohol and drugs or the nudity of minors, are put in place to assure the legality of the festival under federal and state laws. The Guardians of the Sacred Circle are a separate protective order which provides safety and medical services for the festival. PSG is clothing-optional throughout most of the campsite. Relatively few attendees go skyclad. There are some limitations for minors (in more private circumstances where adults are also present) in order to assure compliance with state law. At PSG, each adult must perform four hours of community service or equivalent (as determined by Circle Sanctuary staff) during the course of the week. These periods of time are referred to as \\"workshifts\\". Many of these workshifts are great opportunities to interact with festival-goers in other parts of the site. Music Music is very much a part of the activities at Pagan Spirit Gathering. Chanting and singing can be heard at the Morning Meetings, at musically oriented workshops, and one can find drumming and dancing into the night at the Bonfire Circle. There is a performing arts show on the main stage and concerts every afternoon and evening of the event. The main stage has hosted numerous performers and bands, notable musicians include Owain Phyfe, Skinny White Chick with S. J. Tucker, and SONA.

It encompassed the islands and southern coastal part of the present-day municipality of Flekkefjord. The municipality included the islands of Hidra and Andabel√∏ya as well as 56 other islands, plus the mainland coast from Abelsnes to the river Sira. The administrative centre was the village of Kirkehavn where Hidra Church is located. Hidra was home to the landscape and coastal painter Olav Omland (1909‚Äì1998). He was also a poet and songwriter, and composed the song about Hidra \\"Hidrasangen\\". Hidra was also home to the eccentric personality and artist Tatjana Lars Kristian Guldbrandsen. Name The Old Norse form of the name was Hitr. The name is probably derived from a word with the meaning \\"split\\" or \\"cleft\\" (referring to the fact that the island is almost split in two by the Rasv√•g fjord). Prior to 1918, the name was spelled Hitter√∏. History The parish of Nes og Hitter√∏ was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). However, on 8 October 1893, this municipality was split into two municipalities: Hitter√∏ (population: 2,075) and Nes (population: 1,704).

Life and Kingship The D√°l nAraidi kingdom was in fact a number of competing Cruthin tribes at this time so succession to the kingship was achieved through force of arms and prestige rather than by any regular means. According to the genealogies, Fiachnae's predecessor was his great-uncle √Åed Dub mac Suibni, who died c. 588, and F√≠achnae became king some time after √Åed Dub's death.

Local Pagan Pride groups sponsor \\"Pagan Pride Day\\" festivals, usually in public locations such as city parks or university campuses. The first recorded reference to \\"Pagan Pride\\" can be traced to 1992. The Pagan Pride Project The Pagan Pride Project is an organization whose aims are to promote understanding of Paganism, support various charities, and bring Pagan communities closer together. The project's logo shows various Pagan symbols encircling the Earth‚Äîthe yin/yang symbol, Celtic cross, Mj√∂llnir, a Triple Goddess symbol, an Eye of Horus, Venus of Willendorf, ankh, pentagram, triskelion, Stone Megalith, Green Man, Enneagram, and the Kabbalistic Tree of life. Pagan Pride Day Pagan Pride Day is an annual event held in a variety of locations across the world. The festivities are as varied as the communities who organize them. Some events are simple open picnics or cook-outs held in a local park; others are full-fledged festivals with rented venues, performance stages, and food facilities. There are, however, several common elements. First and foremost is the goal of educating the public about the beliefs and practices of various Neopagan traditions. The general public is invited and there are usually tables of reading materials, staffed by members of a range of Neopagan denominations. Speakers or workshops may focus on dispelling common misconceptions about Neopaganism, or may seek to educate outsiders about the details of their particular beliefs and practices. The second most common aspect is charitable work. Many Pagan Pride coordinating committees choose a local charity to support with fundraising and/or donations raised by the event. These charities might be organizations related to environmental conservation, animal rescues, food pantries, shelters for victims of domestic violence, or related causes. Pagan Pride Day events are open to the public and generally welcoming to families and children. Hosting a PPD event requires adherence to a range of policies. Many Pagan Pride festivals showcase local Neopagan performers, artisans, and merchants. Some events offer open mic sessions where attendees might chant, tell jokes, spin tales, drum, or read poetry.

It is the home stadium of FC Dynamo Kyiv yet not the main stadium, for which Dynamo uses the bigger NSC Olympiyskiy. The Dynamo Stadium is also a major alternative stadium for the Ukrainian national football team that often plays its exhibition games. The stadium holds 16,873 people, and was built in 1934 as Vsevolod Balitsky Dynamo Stadium by the project of Vasyl Osmak as the central stadium of the Ukrainian SSR Dynamo sports society associated with OGPU/NKVD. It was built in the park area next to the NKVD building which is today is known the Government building. History The Dynamo Stadium was built in 1934 during transferring of the Soviet capital from Kharkiv to Kyiv. It was built near the newly erected building that was initially intended as a republican NKVD headquarters in Kyiv (today building of the Government of Ukraine). The stadium current name was given in honour of the former Dynamo Kyiv and USSR national football team coach Valeriy Lobanovskyi in 2002, who died on 13 May that year, at age 63. In January 2014, the square adjoining the stadium's main gate from Hrushevskoho Street became scene of the month-long street battle between attacking activists of the Euromaidan revolution and police. At several moments, the clashes took place immediately on top of the stadium gate, with at least one rioter filmed being thrown down at the pavement by police officers. The square, the entrance colonnade & stadium fence were completely smoked over by prolonged artificial tyres-fed fire, as well as surrounding street buildings. By 2015, the entrance square was completely restored. The only reminder of the revolution events is an amateur monument erected in the middle of the Hrushevskoho Street driveway opposite the stadium gate. In 2017, new seats were installedhttp://stadiumdb.com/news/2017/07/kyiv_major_revamp_at_dynamos_old_home as the ground was chosen to host the final of the 2017‚Äì18 UEFA Women's Champions League. Monuments In 1971, near the stadium was installed a monument of the Dynamo players involved in the game known in the Soviet historiography as the Death Match and the players who perished in the World War II. The sculpture is composed of steel, in which figures of four players are carved using high relief. The architects responsible for the sculpture, V. Bogdanovska and I. Maslenkov, are well known for designing stations of the Kyiv Metro. The sculptor was I. Gorovyi. The monument is located by the service entrance to the stadium, so many fans are unable to see it. On 11 May 2003, before the first anniversary of the death of Valeriy Lobanovskyi, a monument was opened. The famous coach is sitting on the trainer's bench and is watching a match. The pedestal is a large ball. The total weight is about 5 tonnes. The monument was create by a group of nine people led by the architect Vasil Klimenko and the sculptor Vladimir Filatov.Monument V.

The main venue is Romerike friidrettsstadion, an athletics stadium with eight all-weather running tracks. It has multiple football pitches, including one with artificial turf and one with gravel. The park features of two arenas, LSK-Hallen with a full-size artificial football pitch and Skedsmohallen for indoor sports. The venue is located adjacent to √Ör√•sen Stadion, the home ground of Lillestr√∏m SK. The main tenants for Lillestr√∏m idrettspark are Flisbyen BK and Focus FK in football, and Str√∏mmen IF, L√∏renskog FIL and Minerva IS in athletics. The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was the main venue for Lillestr√∏m SK until 1951. The athletics stadium opened two years later. In 2004, the artificial turf pitch was laid and in 2007 a new athletics venue and LSK-Hallen opened. History The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was originally named Lillestr√∏m kommunale idrettsplass (\\"Lillestr√∏m Municipal Sports Place\\"). Lillestr√∏m SK was the main football tenant from the opening until 1951, when they opened √Ör√•sen Stadion. The original athletics stadium opened in 1953, located at the same place as the current athletics stadium. Minerva arranged the first tournament on 16 June 1954. Subsequently, a velodrome was installed outside the running track. A municipal grant of 5,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) allowed a steeplechase obstacle to be installed in 1959. A cage for discus throw and hammer throw was installed on the current artificial turf pitch in 1970. The athletics venue suffered with drainage problems, and from the 1970s it was no longer used for competitions. This forced Minerva IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in Oslo and Jessheim stadion in Ullensaker. In 1976, Minerva IS took initiative to lay all-weather running track, but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK 2 million for all-weather running track, but the funding was reallocated to fix a leaking roof on Skedsmo Church. No further grants were issued for the stadium. In 2004, Lillestr√∏m SK took initiative to convert one of the gravel pitches to artificial turf. The proposal also saw the installation of floodlights and under-soil heating. The new field cost NOK 9 million, which was covered by LSK, betting grants and the municipality. Construction started in August 2004 and was completed in November. The pitch located behind Skedsmohallen was converted to a throwing venue in 2005. Ahead of the 2003 municipal elections, the Labour Party mayor candidates for the municipalities of Skedsmo, R√¶lingen and L√∏renskog, Andreas Hamnes, Terje Granerud and √Öge Tovan, proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for Nedre Romerike. The proposal was followed up by the three athletics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Str√∏mmen IF and L√∏renskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestr√∏m idrettspark because of the availability of existing utilities, parking and changing rooms, which would reduce the investment costs. In the process, Str√∏mmen stadion was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive artificial turf and Marikollen was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in L√∏renskog was deemed unsuitable. The choice of Lillestr√∏m idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005. Grants were issued from the municipalities in 2005, the size of which was determined by the population of each municipality. Multiconsult was hired to design the venue and construction started on 28 June 2006. Earthworks were completed by November and asphalting started on 16 May 2007. The all-weather surface was completed on 13 June and technical installations were completed by mid-August. The new venue was inaugurated on 1 September 2007. It cost NOK 28.6 million, of which NOK 15.9 million were paid for by the municipalities in ratio of their population. The rest was financed through a combination of betting grants, value added tax compensation and volunteer work. In 2006, the municipality approved Lillestr√∏m SK's plans to build an indoor football pitch. The hall was inaugurated on 11 October 2007 and cost NOK 62 million. In 2009, Lillestr√∏m launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host the UEFA Euro 2016. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestr√∏m. One of three potential locations was at Lillestr√∏m idrettspark. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues. The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent. Facilities Lillestr√∏m idrettspark is located across the railway from √Ör√•sen Stadion, the home ground of Lillestr√∏m SK. It is the main recreational sports complex in Skedsmo, located just north of Lillestr√∏m. It contains several football pitches, including one with gravel and one with artificial turf. The artificial and two of the natural grass pitches have undersoil heating. LSK-Hallen contains an indoor artificial turf football pitch with capacity for 3,000 spectators. Skedsmohallen is the main indoor arena in Skedsmo; it is largely used for ball sports, athletics and martial arts, but also sees cultural evens such as concerts. Lillestr√∏m og Omeng Bueskyttere undertakes archery practice behind Skedsmohallen. Also at the park is a driving range and a skateboarding park. Romerike friidrettsstadion is an inter-municipal athletics venue jointly owned by the municipalities of Skedsmo, R√¶lingen and L√∏renskog. The venue is built to a sufficient standard to host the Norwegian Athletics Championship. It features a long all-weather surface with eight tracks, permitting 110 meters hurdles on both sides. Both sides have two jumping pits, and two areas for pole vault and two for high jump. Javelin throw is possible from both ends, with undersoil heating in the last part of the approach. The throwing cage permits discus throw and hammer throw, and the area for shot put is heated. The venue is used exclusively for athletics and is constructed such that it cannot be used for football. The athletics field has a spectator capacity of 750, of which 185 can be seated. It has floodlighting at 200 lux and electronic timekeeping equipment, as well as two huts. In addition, a gravel football pitch is used for throwing practice. Events Lillestr√∏m SK uses Lillestr√∏m idrettspark and LSK-Hallen for training sessions for the elite team and for lower-level matches. The Women's Premier League side LSK Kvinner FK play their home matches in LSK- Hallen. The football grounds are also used by Flisbyen BK and Focus FK in the Third Division. The athletics venue is used by Minerva IS, L√∏renskog FIL and Str√∏mmen IF. During the 1952 Winter Olympics, the stadium was one of five rinks used for ice hockey. Three rinks were located outside Oslo in order to spread the games to a wider audience.Organising Committee for the VI Winter Olympic Games (1952): 31 The single match at Lillestr√∏m stadion saw Poland beat Finland 4‚Äì2 on 23 February.Organising Committee for the VI Winter Olympic Games (1952): 249 The former velodrome hosted two Norwegian championships. The athletics venue annually hosts Romerikslekene and one of the three Huyndai Grand Prix events.

In 2011, all students, nearly 250, left with one recognised qualification resulting in a 100% pupil pass rate.Department for Education, Department for Education, Kingsdale Foundation School, 2011, Department for Education TES, Magazine, Informants 'lose faith' in cheating inquiry, 08-06-12, by William Stewart In 2012, as reported by Ofsted in the December 2012 report, Year 11 attainment experienced a 'significant dip'.Ofsted Inspection Report, December 2012 In reporting on this situation, Ofsted stated that \\"During this inspection, all groups of students were making good progress in the large majority of lessons and outstanding progress in some lessons.\\". The report went on to state \\"..As a result, the progress made by all students, including boys, has now returned to the good levels seen in the past and attainment is rising rapidly across the school, particularly in English, mathematics and science.\\" In 2012, the school's GCSE results fell, particularly prior to the English GCSE resits which were offered to all schools caught up in the national English GCSE examination scandal. This equated to roughly 1 in 14 students nationally resitting the examination in October 2012. Performance Tables for 2012 achievement published in January 2013, do not reflect the attainment of students who achieved a Grade C or above in these English GCSE resits (36% of Kingsdale pupils achieved 5A*-C GCSE grades with English and Mathematics).Department for Education website, Kingsdale Foundation School, Performance tables The school results published on their website are therefore considerably higher than this figure as they reflect the addition of resit grades (currently published at 5A*-C GCSE grades with English and Mathematics at 49%). The national average for secondary schools in England and Wales is 59% of pupils achieving 5 A*-C grades including English and Maths. In 2010 and 2011 the school was above national averages for the percentage of students achieving 5A*-C GCSE grades including English and mathematics. In 2012 it was below. The school has met the Government's floor target for school performance and this has been confirmed. Building refurbishment project Architect Philip Marsh during the 2003 refurbishment. The modernist building was designed by the London County Council Architect's Department, under the leadership of Leslie Martin. In 'austerity Britain', Martin's team had to scrimp on materials creating unique 'honeycombed' plaster walls and minimal scree between floors. Still the design observed the best principles of modernism, with concrete stairs positioned at each corner of the oblong building, boxed in glass and steel frames. The shoe- box shape described a 'quadrangle' that served as an inner playground as well as letting natural light into the corridors. William Turnbull's sculpture 'Stargazer', popularly known as 'the Fish' stood in the quad.Making the Grade , The Dulwich Society Newsletter, Spring 2004. In the early 2000s (decade), the architects De Rijke Marsh and Morgan and builders Galliford Try refurbished the building, adding a translucent, and sun-sensitive 'skin' over the quadrangle, adding additional corridors, and constructing a wooden framed, egg-shaped 'pod' that projected into the quad, containing a music hall. The re-build was controversial after the administrator Hilary Cottam was awarded the Designer of the Year award 2005.James Heartfield, Building School Success, Prospect magazine (Scotland). The building refurbishment and the stakeholders, including architects drMM, have achieved world recognition for the project.

Languedoc-Roussillon wine, including the vin de pays labeled Vin de Pays d'Oc, is produced in southern France. While \\"Languedoc\\" can refer to a specific historic region of France and Northern Catalonia, usage since the 20th century (especially in the context of wine) has primarily referred to the northern part of the Languedoc-Roussillon r√©gion of France, an area which spans the Mediterranean coastline from the French border with Spain to the region of Provence. The area has around under vines and is the single biggest wine-producing region in the world, being responsible for more than a third of France's total wine production.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 293 Workman Publishing 2001 In 2001, the region produced more wine than the United States.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 294 Workman Publishing 2001  History  A vineyard in Villeneuve-l√®s-Maguelone bordering the Gulf of Lion. The history of Languedoc wines can be traced to the first vineyards planted along the coast near Narbonne by the early Greeks in the fifth century BC. Along with parts of Provence, these are the oldest planted vineyards in France. The region of Languedoc has belonged to France since the thirteenth century and the Roussillon was acquired from Spain in the mid-seventeenth century. The two regions were joined as one administrative region in the late 1980s. From the 4th century through the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Languedoc had a reputation for producing high quality wine. In Paris during the 14th century, wines from the St. Chinian area were prescribed in hospitals for their \\"healing powers\\".K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 295 Workman Publishing 2001 During the advent of the Industrial Age in the late 19th century, production shifted towards mass-produced le gros rouge‚Äîcheap red wine that could satisfy the growing work force. The use of highly prolific grape varieties produced high yields and thin wines, which were normally blended with red wine from Algeria to give them more body.Assorted Editors The Pocket Wine Guide p. 84 Barnes & Noble, 2006 The phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off many of the higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside. In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine p. 205 Global Book Publishing 2006 During both World Wars the Languedoc was responsible for providing the daily wine rations given to French soldiers. In 1962, Algeria gained its independence from France, bringing about an end to the blending of the stronger Algerian red wine to mask the thin le gros rouge. This event, coupled with French consumers moving away from cheap red wines in the 1970s, has contributed to several decades of surplus wine production in France, with Languedoc as the largest contributor to the European \\"wine lake\\" and recurring European Union subsidies aimed at reducing production. These developments prompted many Languedoc producers to start refocusing on higher quality, but has also led to many local and regional protests, including violent ones from the infamous Comit√© R√©gional d'Action Viticole (CRAV). Despite the general reputation as a mass producer and a consensus that the region is in the midst of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pp. 294‚Äì96 Workman Publishing 2001 Languedoc-Roussillon Region Climate and geography The Languedoc-Roussillon region shares many terrain and climate characteristics with the neighboring regions of Southern Rhone and Provence. The region stretches from the Banyuls AOC at the Spanish border and Pyrenees in the west, along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to the Rhone River and Provence in the east. The northern boundaries of the region sit on the Massif Central with the C√©vennes mountain ranges and valleys dominating the area. Many vineyards are located along the H√©rault River.Kim Marcus Languedoc Wakes Up Wine Spectator March 31, 2000 Vineyard near Forques, with Pyrenees in the distance Vineyards in the Languedoc are generally planted along the coastal plains of the Mediterranean while those in the Roussillon are to be found in the narrow valleys around the Pyrenees. The peak growing season (between May and August) is very dry and the majority of annual rainfall occurs during the winter. In the Languedoc, the plains area is the most arid and hottest region of France. The region's Mediterranean climate is very conducive to growing a large amount of a wide variety of grapes, with vintners in the area excelling in mass production. The average annual temperature is . The tramontane inland wind from the northwest often accentuates the dry climate; drought is the most common threat to vine production, with French AOC and European Union regulation prohibiting the use of irrigation.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine p. 204 Global Book Publishing 2006 In December 2006, the French government responded to global warming concerns and relaxed some of the irrigation regulations.Corie Brown Climate change and the world wine map March 2, 2007 Los Angeles Times In 1999 severe weather had damaging effects on the wine producing industry, including hailstorms in May that affected Roussillon and a rain surge in mid November that saw a year's worth of rain fall in 36 hours in the areas of Corbi√®res and Minervois in the western Languedoc. The composition of soil in the Languedoc varies from the chalk, limestone and gravel based soils inland to more alluvial soils near the coast. Some of the more highly rated vineyards are laid on top of ancient riverbed stones similar to those of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 297 Workman Publishing 2001  Appellations  A Chardonnay from the Pay d'Oc. The five best known appellations in the Languedoc include Languedoc AOC (formerly known as the Coteaux du Languedoc), Corbi√®res AOC, Faug√®res, Minervois AOC, and Saint-Chinian AOCs. The vast majority of Languedoc wines are produced by wine cooperatives which number more than 500.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 299 Workman Publishing 2001 However, the appellation system in the region is undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing. One recent change is that the Coteaux du Languedoc has changed name to Languedoc and been extended to include also the Roussillon. Within the larger Languedoc AOC appellations are several sub- districts, or Cru's, with distinct wine styles of their own. Some of these sub-districts have pending AOC applications to become appellations in their own right and some have been granted sub-appellations to the umbrella appellation Languedoc AOC. These include the Quatourze, La Clape, Montpeyroux, St. Saturnin, Picpoul de Pinet, Terrasses du Larzac, and Pic St.-Loup.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 300 Workman Publishing 2001 The boundary of the eastern Languedoc with the Southern Rh√¥ne Valley wine region was moved slightly in 2004, with the result that Costi√®res de N√Æmes AOC is now a Rh√¥ne appellation rather than a Languedoc one. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation's wine to the regional committee of the Rh√¥ne valley.JORF n¬∞177 du 1 ao√ªt 2004 page 13753 texte n¬∞ 25: Arr√™t√© du 19 juillet 2004 relatif √† la composition des comit√©s r√©gionaux vins et eaux-de-vie de l'Institut national des appellations d'origine Local producers of C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of Rh√¥ne wines in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare, so out of habit, Costi√®res de N√Æmes remains listed as a Languedoc wine in many publications. Grapes Syrah is a principal grape in many Languedoc red blends The Languedoc-Roussillon area is home to numerous grape varieties, including many international varieties like Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc, and Chardonnay. The traditional Rh√¥ne grapes of Mourvedre, Grenache, Syrah, and Viognier are also prominent.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 298 Workman Publishing 2001 Chardonnay is a major white grape, used in the Vin de Pays d'Oc and the sparkling Cr√©mant de Limoux. Others include Chenin blanc and Mauzac, which is also the principal grape in the sparkling Blanquette de Limoux. The sweet fortified wines of the Muscat de Frontignan and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois regions are made with the Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains grapes. In the Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC, fortified wines are made from Muscat of Alexandria grapes. Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre are major grapes of the Corbi√®res, Faug√®res, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs. Cinsault is also commonly used in ros√© production along with Lladoner Pelut, Piquepoul noir, Terret noir, and Grenache. Grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the Banyuls and Rivesaltes region. Some of the oldest vines in France are Carignan grapes. Winemakers often use carbonic maceration to soften the tannins.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course p. 199 Abbeville Press 2003 Other varieties that can be found include Roussanne, Marsanne, Vermentino, Bourboulenc, Clairette blanche, Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Piquepoul blanc, Piquepoul gris, and Macabeo.  Wines and taxonomy  Two wines from the Languedoc. The bottle on the left is an AOC classification wine from the Costi√®res de N√Æmes and the bottle on the right is a Vins de Pays labeled with the grapes used to produce the wine Wines from the Languedoc can carry an enormous number of names, ranging from broad regional designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbi√®res and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livini√®re, Corbi√®res-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope.R. Joseph French Wine Revised and Updated p. 191 Dorling Kindersley 2005 While these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving their product, others have criticized the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification. The majority of wine produced in the Languedoc are labeled vin ordinaire. There is also sizable production of Vins Doux Naturels.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine p. 138 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Vins de Pays The introduction of the vins de pays, a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC, opened up the Languedoc wine industry to the labeling of varietal wines and the blending of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Chardonnay. Examples include Vin de pays d'Oc, Vin de pays d'Aude, Vin de pays de l'H√©rault, and Vin de Pays du Gard. Winemakers such as Guy Anderson, Thierry Boudinaud and E. & J. Gallo Winery capitalized on this new horizon, producing wines like Fat Bastard and Red Bicyclette.G. Taber The Judgment of Paris: California vs France p. 286 Simon & Schuster Vins Doux Naturels Vins Doux Naturels are \\"naturally sweet\\" wines that have been fortified with brandy to stop fermentation, leaving residual sugar to add sweetness to the wine. The majority of Languedoc sweet white wines are made with a variety of Muscat grapes. The red fortified wines of the Banyuls are made from Grenache grapes, normally have an alcohol level between 16 and 17% and carry residual sugars in the 8 to 12% range.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 301 Workman Publishing 2001 In Banyuls, winemakers use various methods to \\"bake\\" their wines to encourage deep raisin colors. Some winemakers utilize a solera system of transporting the wine among different size barrels of various ages that are left out in the sun to warm. Others will put the wine in large glass jars to expose it to direct sunlight. In addition to the dark color, the resulting wines often have a nutty, rancid taste called rancio. In the Banyuls Grand Cru AOC the wine is required to be aged in wood barrels for two and a half years.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course p. 201 Abbeville Press 2003 Cr√©mant de Limoux A Blanquette de Limoux from the Languedoc The cr√©mant produced in the Languedoc is made according to the M√©thode Traditionnelle ‚Äì formerly known as m√©thode champenoise ‚Äì the same method used to produce Champagne. M√©thode Traditionnelle includes a second fermentation in the bottle to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast. Languedoc cr√©mant is produced in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The wines are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled m√©thode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation, and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.K.

It was first published in 1939. Background and composition The Siegfried Line was a chain of fortifications along Germany's Western border, analogous to the Maginot Line in France. At the first big wartime variety concert organized by ENSA, which was broadcast by the BBC from RAF Hendon in North London on 17 October 1939, Adelaide Hall performed the song accompanied by Mantovani and his orchestra. A rare newsreel of this concert exists,Mantovani: A Lifetime in Music by Colin MacKenzie, page 78: and the footage is thought to be the earliest surviving film of a performer singing the song. The song was used as a morale-booster during the war, particularly up to and during the Battle of France. It began: Leslie Sarony (1897‚Äì1985) and Leslie Holmes added some possibly unofficial lines. The Sarony and Holmes version put \\"Mother dear, I'm writing you from somewhere in France\\" at the start and then, after the main section, added four lines starting \\"Everybody's mucking in and doing their job\\". The song was recorded by many British musicians during the Second World War, including Arthur Askey, Flanagan and Allen, and Vera Lynn.

Plot summary Erik Ponti is a fourteen-year-old boy living in the 1950s Stockholm lower middle class. His sadistic father beats him often, his mother rarely intervenes the abuse and his six-year-old brother takes advantage of the situation. He excels in school subjects that interest him; \\"He ran the fastest and scored the most goals, could take a gargantuan beating, hit with full strength at the first punch and on top of all that he was the superior student in several subjects\\", which lends him a position as gang leader and favored student of half his teachers. (He compulsively leads the class to rebel against the other half, who beat the students.) He lives with violence both at home and at school and begins feeling sympathy and pity towards those he beats, when his life comes tumbling down because of the school gang's criminal activities. Betrayed by those he thought of as his friends, the gang, he is expelled from school and \\"pre-emptively\\" expelled from every school in Stockholm by his zealous and influential principal. He comes home prepared to face his father \\"for the last time\\" but is surprisingly sent to a boarding school outside of the city, the expensive and exclusive Stj√§rnsberg school. Away from his father and everyone who knew him, Erik is determined to make a new life without violence for himself, but the traditions of the school stop him. Unable to abide the abuse of the senior students, who make it their habit to boss around and beat those below them, \\"especially new and mouthy kids\\", he begins a spiral of escalating violence and psychological abuse under the nose of unwitting teachers and adults. Noses are broken, threats are uttered, buckets of feces thrown around and Erik spends a cold winter night soaking wet and tied to the ground. Erik and his friend and roommate Pierre hold in-depth discussions about the nature of evil, the importance of resistance and methods of fighting, while spending summer and winter breaks abroad. Erik develops a forbidden relationship with Marja, a school cook from Savonia, Finland, and wins a swimming trophy in a school championship. He is thrown out of the swimming team as an attempt to make him follow orders, and begins working out obsessively by weightlifting to vent his frustrations, panicked over the prospect of being expelled if he lays a hand on a senior student. When Pierre surrenders to the abuse directed at him to punish Erik and leaves the school, Erik takes to stalking the woods in disguise at night and systematically breaking the nose and teeth of those responsible, when he finds them alone. Marja, fired because of the suspicions of her relationship with Erik, sends him a love letter which the principal uses as grounds to have him expelled, but with the aid of Mr. Ekengren, the family lawyer, Erik threatens legal action over the confiscation of his mail and is allowed to finish his last semester in relative peace. Although not before tracking down his chief tormentor, the chairman of the students' council Otto Silverhjelm, alone in the woods and scaring him into hysteric crying and vomiting. Finishing his basic education with the highest possible grades - barring the lowest possible grade in conduct and behavior - Erik returns home and deals with his father. Semi-autobiographical Jan Guillou has stated that Ondskan is basically a true story. \\"Some things, like the identity of the love interest, the placing of the swimming pool and such were changed to make the story better. But the stuff you're wondering about - the violence, the crap, the psychological terror - is absolutely true.\\" Indeed, the school Guillou went to was scandalized in the newspapers and bankrupted a few years after his graduation, and he speaks in interviews of his extensive and personal experience of violence. Characters Erik Ponti is a teenager hardened by his abusive stepfather, who rebels against anyone who would use their authority to hurt people, fighting with peerless physical and intellectual prowess. He is the autobiographical alter ego of Jan Guillou, and appear in later novels. Fyrtornet (Lighthouse) is a grunt in Erik's gang at the beginning of the novel. An outrageously large fourteen-year-old, he beats up those who owe the gang money and at one point fights Erik for the leadership of the gang. Farsan (Dad) is a waiter at a high-class restaurant in Stockholm and Erik's father. A sadist who habitually makes up excuses to beat Erik - but never his little brother - and secretly lets his twin large dobermanns loose to kill a small dog who enters his property, for his amusement. Pierre Tanguy is chubby, unathletic, bespectacled and maybe the most brilliant student ever at Stj√§rnsberg. He is mostly left alone by bullies who consider him \\"no challenge\\", until his friendship with Erik makes him a target. The exception to the rule against teachers abusing students, he is ridiculed by the history teacher who uses his body to point at examples of \\"undesirable\\" qualities. He also appears in later novels. Otto \\"Skitenhielm\\" (\\"Shittyhielm\\") Silverhielm gains the highest authority among the students' ranks during Erik's second year at Stj√§rnsberg, and uses every opportunity to punish his subjects physically. He seems to thoroughly enjoy hitting people, leading to discussions about him being evil, sadistic or a victim of misdirected aggression.

In the Second World War he was a fighter ace, first in the French Air Force in the Battle of France and then in the Royal Air Force. In the French Air Force Va≈°√°tko shot down at least 12 enemy aircraft in May and June 1940. In the RAF he shot down another 14 enemy aircraft between October 1940 and his death in June 1942. He commanded No. 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF from June 1941 and RAF Fighter Command's Czechoslovak fighter wing from May 1942. France awarded Va≈°√°tko the Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945 with seven palms, two gold stars and one silver star, and made him a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. The United Kingdom awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross. Va≈°√°tko was killed in action in June 1942 by a mid-air collision over the English Channel between his Supermarine Spitfire and an enemy Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Early life Va≈°√°tko was born in 1908 in ƒåel√°kovice in central Bohemia. He was one of five children of a cabinet-maker, also called Alois Va≈°√°tko, who served in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces and returned from the First World War as an invalid. When Va≈°√°tko was still a child the family moved to T√Ωni≈°tƒõ nad Orlic√≠ in northeastern Bohemia, where Va≈°√°tko completed secondary school. He then studied at a teacher training college in Hradec Kr√°lov√© and became a schoolteacher in Litomƒõ≈ôice in northern Bohemia. Czechoslovak armed forces On 1 October 1928 Va≈°√°tko changed career, joining the Czechoslovak Army as an artilleryman. In 1929 he began training at the military academy in Hranice. In July 1931 he passed out as a Poruchik (junior lieutenant) and was posted to Olomouc in Moravia as commander of the 2nd battery of the 7th Artillery Regiment. On 1 October 1935 he was promoted to Senior Lieutenant. Letov ≈†-328 aerial reconnaissance biplane Also in 1935 Va≈°√°tko trained as an air observer at the military aviation school at Prostƒõjov in Moravia. On 31 December 1936 he transferred from the Army to the Czechoslovak Air Force. On 15 November 1937 he was appointed commander of the 14th Observation Squadron of the 2nd \\"Dr Edvard Bene≈°\\" Air Regiment stationed at Olomouc, which was equipped with Letov ≈†-328 reconnaissance aircraft. On 30 September 1938 France and the United Kingdom allowed Germany to annexe the Sudetenland. Va≈°√°tko continued his training and on 1 March 1939 he qualified as a pilot. On 15 March Germany occupied the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia and imposed a Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia with a puppet government that it ordered to dissolve its armed forces. The Czechoslovak Air Force ceased to exist, and the Luftwaffe confiscated its aircraft. Leaving the protectorate was not allowed, but many airmen chose to do so illegally. In July 1939 Va≈°√°tko passed through the now independent Slovak Republic and over the Beskid mountain range into Poland, where he reported to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Krak√≥w. On 28 July he and other Czechoslovaks left Gdynia aboard the Polish ocean liner . French Air Force Va≈°√°tko disembarked in France, where Czechoslovak refugees were not yet allowed to join the Arm√©e de l'air. After France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 Czechoslovaks were allowed to join the French Foreign Legion. Only after 17 November were they allowed to the Arm√©e de l'air. Va≈°√°tko enlisted and was trained at the Centre d'Instruction de la Chasse (\\"Fighter Training Centre\\") at Chartres air base. On 1 May 1940 he was promoted to Captain. On 10 May Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium and attacked France. Curtiss H-75 fighters flying in close formation in June 1940 The next day Va≈°√°tko and fellow-Czechoslovaks Adolf Vr√°na and Tom√°≈° Vyb√≠ral were posted to the Groupe de Chasse I/5 \\"La Fayette\\", which was equipped with new Curtiss H-75-C1 fighter aircraft. Va≈°√°tko quickly became a fighter ace. By the end of the six-week campaign he was credited with shooting down 12 German aircraft and probably two more. France awarded him the Croix de guerre, to which it added seven palms, two gold stars and one silver star. He was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. After France capitulated to Germany on 22 June 1940, GC I/5 withdrew to French Algeria. Va≈°√°tko left and travelled via Morocco to Gibraltar, whence he went by ship to Cardiff in Wales. Royal Air Force Armourers of 312 Squadron prepare ammunition belts, with Va≈°√°tko's Hurricane Mk I fighter, DU-J, in the background The United Kingdom quickly agreed to enlist Czechoslovak airmen in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Va≈°√°tko was commissioned as a Pilot Officer and retrained to fly Hurricane Mk I aircraft. He was posted to the newly formed No. 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF, where he was allocated to Yellow Flight with Sergeant Josef Stehl√≠k and led by Flight Lieutenant Denys Gillam. By October 1940 the squadron was stationed at RAF Speke outside Liverpool. About 16:00 hrs on 8 October a lone Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber of Kampfgeschwader 2/806 was sighted flying up the River Mersey. Yellow Flight was scrambled, with Va≈°√°tko flying Hurricane L1926, code letters DU-J. All three fighters machine-gunned the Ju 88, killing its observer and setting fire to its two engines. At 16:15 the bomber made a forced landing in a field near Bromborough Dock and the surviving crew were captured. Spitfire Mk VB fighter in flight The RAF promoted Va≈°√°tko to Flight Lieutenant on 28 October 1940, and on 7 November he was given command of \\"B\\" flight of 312 Squadron. On 5 June 1941 Va≈°√°tko was appointed to command the whole of 312 Squadron. In October the squadron converted from Hurricanes to Supermarine Spitfires. Va≈°√°tko was promoted to Squadron Leader on 5 June 1941. The RAF had three Czechoslovak-manned fighter squadrons: 310 Squadron, 313 Squadron and Va≈°√°tko's 312 Squadron. In 1942 it grouped them into a Czechoslovak fighter wing to operate together. On 1 May Va≈°√°tko was made its commanding officer and on 30 May 1942 he was promoted to Wing Commander. Va≈°√°tko continued the run of victories he had begun in France. He is credited with shooting down four enemy aircraft single-handed, another ten jointly with other airmen, and probably two more. Death By June 1942, 312 Squadron was based at RAF Exeter. On 23 June a force of Douglas Boston light bombers was sent on a \\"Ramrod\\" raid to bomb an airfield in Brittany. Va≈°√°tko commanded the bombers' fighter escort, which comprised Spitfire Mk VB aircraft from all three squadrons of the Czechoslovak fighter wing. One of the 7./JG 2 Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters that intercepted Va≈°√°tko's Spitfire escorts on 23 June 1942 As the raiding force was returning to England a Staffel of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters of Jagdgeschwader 2 \\"Richthofen\\" from Morlaix airfield intercepted them over the English Channel. The escorts successfully defended the bombers and destroyed two Fw 190s, but seven Spitfires were also destroyed. Va≈°√°tko's Spitfire collided in mid-air with an Fw 190 flown by Unteroffizier Wilhelm Reuschling of 7./JG 2, destroying both aircraft. Reuschling baled out, was rescued from the sea off Start Point, Devon and made a prisoner of war, but Va≈°√°tko went down with his 'plane and his body was never recovered. Achievements and honours Va≈°√°tko became a fighter ace twice: first in the Battle of France and again in the RAF. Among RAFVR Czechoslovak fighter aces, only Sqn Ldr Karel Kuttelwascher and Sgt Josef Franti≈°ek shot down more aircraft than Va≈°√°tko. As a Wing Commander, Va≈°√°tko was one of the RAF's most senior Czechoslovak officers in front-line service. Va≈°√°tko had just been awarded his DFC on the day of his death. The Inspector-General of the Czechoslovak Air Force, Air Commodore Karel Janou≈°ek, called Va≈°√°tko's death \\"the most cruel blow to our entire air force\\".\\"nejkrutƒõj≈°√≠ r√°nu pro cel√© na≈°e letectvo\\", Monuments and memorials Va≈°√°tkova street in the ƒåern√Ω Most suburb of Prague In 1945 after Germany surrendered, two Czechoslovak postage stamps commemorating Va≈°√°tko were issued. The first has a face value of 50 hellers and the second has a face value of five Czechoslovak crowns. On 23 June 1946, the fourth anniversary of Va≈°√°tko's death, a memorial plaque was unveiled at his birthplace in ƒåel√°kovice. On 23 June 2012 the 70th anniversary of his death was commemorated with a ceremony at his monument, which included a flypast by two Czech Air Force Saab JAS 39 Gripen multirole combat aircraft. Three streets are named \\"Va≈°√°tkova\\" after him. One is in ƒåel√°kovice where he was born and another is in T√Ωni≈°tƒõ nad Orlic√≠ where he grew up. The other is in the ƒåern√Ω Most suburb of Prague, which has streets named after numerous Second World War Czechoslovak airmen who served in the French Air Force or the RAF. On 3 March 1948 the Czechoslovak Air Force named its 4th Fighter Regiment \\"Va≈°√°tko\\", but in a reorganisation in 1950 it was renumbered the 6th Air Regiment and ceased to carry his name. As Va≈°√°tko has no known grave, his name is recorded on the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede in Surrey.

It is located 15 km west of the capital city of Sofia. It is located on two important transport corridors: Lom ‚Äî Sofia ‚Äî Thessaloniki and Sofia ‚Äî Belgrade. The international railway line to Western Europe passes through the municipality, with a train stop at Kostinbrod Station. The town is crossed by two rivers, the Blato in the north and the Belitsa in the south, both tributaries of the Iskar River. According to the legends, the town was founded by a certain Georgi, who settled near the crossing (–±—Ä–æ–¥, brod) of the Belitsa, thus giving the name to the town (Kostinbrod means \\"Georgi's ford\\"). There he opened a pub that became popular among the merchants arriving in the capital, some of them settling and organizing a village, whose centre of the time is now located west of the road between Sofia and Lom. Historically, an early reference to the locality (as –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–™ –ë–†–û–î–™) can be found in Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria's Oryahov Charter of 1 December 1348. The economy of Kostinbrod was largely based on poultry farming and stock breeding during the Communist period, but a number of factories, including a 120,000 m¬≤ Coca-Cola one, have emerged in democratic times due to the town's favourable position and the liberal zoning policy of the municipality. Kostinbrod is also famous for the mineral waters in the area. Thermae were built in the Izvoro country in Roman times.

Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177 (1990), is a U.S. Supreme Court case dealing with the issue of whether a warrantless search conducted pursuant to third party consent violates the Fourth Amendment when the third party does not actually possess common authority over the premises. Opinion of the Court In an opinion by Justice Scalia and decided 6‚Äì3, the Court held that a warrantless search of premises, when a third party consents to the search but does not possess actual common authority over those premises, is valid if the authorities \\"reasonably believed\\" at the time of the search that the third party possessed common authority over the premises. In reaching its decision, the Court noted that \\"reasonableness\\", not consent, is the touchstone of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence; the Constitution only prohibits \\"unreasonable\\" searches and seizures. Therefore, the constitutional validity of a police determination of consent to enter is not judged by whether the police were correct in their assessment, but by whether, based on the facts available at the moment, it was reasonable to conclude that the consenting party had authority over the premises.

History In the 18th and 19th centuries the village played an important part in the Industrial Revolution. Slave trader Thomas Hinde founded a mill in Lower Dolphinholme in 1795. This worsted mill prospered and the lower village was amongst the first in the United Kingdom to have gas lightinghttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-53404913. Pollution was fed away from the village underground to the mill's chimney which was located in a nearby field. Geography The village, designated as a historic conservation area, is split into two parts - a higher village and a lower part, called Lower Dolphinholme, situated on the River Wyre. The river is the boundary between the Lancaster and Wyre districts. Dolphinholme sits on the edge of the Forest of Bowland and is less than five miles away from Lancaster. Transport links It is only 2¬Ω miles from Junction 33 of the M6 motorway. The nearest railway station is Lancaster. There are no public transport links apart from a public school bus which comes once a day and only during term time. Community The village has a school (Dolphinholme Church of England Primary School), a village hall, a parish church (St Mark's C of E), a Methodist chapel, a pub (the Fleece Inn), a recreational ground, a tennis court and a bowling green. A Post Office visits the village hall on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 10:00am to midday. Most of the historic lower village is still intact, the remains of the mill are in what is now a private garden but the chimney is still standing, in a nearby field. A warehouse, associated with the mill has been converted into housing although it has been (somewhat confusingly) named 'The Mill'. There is a village show that takes place on the second Saturday of September each year in the village hall. It features vegetables, flowers, cooking, photography and a children's section. A village breakfast takes place in the Chapel on the second Saturday or every month (except July and August) from 8:30am to 10:30am and is open to all without booking. The Chapel also hosts a coffee morning every Tuesday from 10:00am until midday which is also open to all without booking.

It is a member of The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). It was founded in 1883 with funding from a 13th-century endowment of John I de Balliol and the bequest of the local industrialist Benjamin Flounders. The ambition was to create a school of the quality of the ancient public schools at a more reasonable cost, whilst accepting pupils regardless of their faith. Originally the North Eastern County School, the name was changed in 1924, but is still generally known locally as the \\"County School\\". The school is set in its own grounds in Teesdale, within the North Pennines, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. An on-site prep school caters for pupils aged 4 to 11, while the senior school caters for pupils aged 11 to 18. The school was previously funded by direct grant. Founded as an all-boys school, it has been fully co- educational since 1993. There are around 660 pupils and some 200 members of staff. Since the 1980s, the school has been one of Britain's most successful at producing top class rugby union players. During this period it schooled England international players Rob Andrew and Tony and Rory Underwood. The school has also produced Mathew Tait, Lee Dickson and Tim Visser, and appeared in three finals of the inter-school Daily Mail Cup. Former pupils in other fields include Edward Mellanby (the discoverer of Vitamin D); industrialist Percy Mills, The Lord Mills; fashion designer Giles Deacon and poet Craig Raine. History The school can trace its origins to an endowment made by John I de Balliol, then Lord of Barnard Castle, in 1229. The school itself was established in 1883 when it occupied temporary premises in Middleton One Row, County Durham, whilst construction of the school was undertaken in Barnard Castle.\\"Stately surroundings for 'merchant' school\\", The Northern Echo (Darlington), 5 May 2004. Initially there were 25 boarders and 10-day pupils, but by the end of 1884, there were 76 boarders. Originally known as the North Eastern County School, the main school building was completed on 2 February 1886 and initially housed 116 boarders and 12-day pupils. The Bishop of Durham presided over the foundation ceremony.The Times Literary Supplement (London), 25 January 1934; pg. 61; Issue 1669. The building was designed by Clark & Moscrop of Darlington in the Jacobean style, and is a Grade II listed building built with local Yorkstone and Lakeland slate. The school was built for the trustees of Benjamin Flounders and the trustees of St. John's Hospital, Barnard Castle, who managed the Baliol endowment, and was overseen by a University of Durham committee. Flounders was a Quaker industrialist who had helped to fund the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The Flounders trustees financed the entirety of the construction of the school with a donation of ¬£31,000. A further ¬£20,000 was raised by subscription to cover initial running costs, ¬£10,000 of which came from St John's Hospital. The gift from St John's was conditional on the school being situated in Barnard Castle, and this determined its location. An early photograph of the school. The school's governance was inspired by the county school movement of Joseph Lloyd Brereton, who was largely inspired in turn by the example of Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School. The object of the school was to provide a liberal education, with fees a fraction of those charged by public schools. Tolerance of non-conformist denominations such as Methodism and Roman Catholicism informed the school's ethos, and the school has always remained independent of the Church of England.http://reports.isi.net/DownloadReport.aspx?s=6224&t;=c Brereton's son became the first headmaster of the school. In contrast to the largely classical education offered by many of the public schools of the time, the school always maintained a focus on scientific and technological education. A strong sporting programme was believed to build character. Extensions over the next few years included a sanatorium in 1890 (now the music school) and a swimming-bath block in 1896. In 1900 a ¬£4,000 (¬£400,000 in 2010) science block was opened by Lord Barnard with Brooke Foss Westcott, Bishop of Durham in attendance.Full text of \\"Life and letters of Brooke Foss Westcott, D.D., D.C.L., sometime Bishop of Durham\\" The building is now inhabited by Tees and Dale houses. The school name was changed to Barnard Castle School in 1924, and it was by this time one of the largest public schools in the North of England. When Harold Birkbeck was appointed headmaster in 1935 there were 193 pupils.BBC Media Player In 1942 the school was elected to the Headmaster's Conference, making it an \\"official\\" public school. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1944, from 1945 the school became a direct grant grammar school and the number of pupils enrolled at the school increased substantially. In April 1961 a ¬£65,000 (¬£1.1 million in 2010) appeal was launched for funding to build new science blocks and a library building. By this time there were 470 boys at the school, more than half of whom progressed to universities or higher education. Birkbeck introduced squash to the school, and made it one of the best-known schools for the sport in the country in the 1960s and 1970s. The novelist Will Cohu described the school in 1974 as \\"a rugged Victorian establishment in a brooding Jacobean-style building overlooking the Tees ... The school was popular with parents who were in the armed forces. It was cheap, did not have any reputation for abuse, and was strong on games\\". The direct-grant revenue stream was abolished in 1975, making the school reliant upon independent funding. An appeal was launched that year to ensure the school's survival, with ¬£109,000 (¬£750,000 in 2011) raised within nine months.The Times, Thursday, 19 February 1976; pg. 16; Issue 59632; col E The school's first computer was installed in January 1978. Frank Macnamara became headmaster in 1980, described as \\"an affable enthusiast\\" in The Guardian.\\"Rugby Union: School with the boys' own story ‚Äì England were not the first to field Andrew and Underwood together\\". The Guardian (London), 16 March 1991. Under his tenure the school would develop its reputation for fostering world-class rugby talent. For the duration of its existence (1980‚Äì1997) the school took part in the Assisted Places Scheme.Assisted Places Scheme (Hansard, 11 March 1996) Girls were first admitted to the Sixth Form in 1981, and the school has been fully co-educational since 1993.Barnard Castle Junior and Senior Mixed Independent School Durham Guide to Independent Schools By 1992 there were around 610 pupils with an approximately 50:50 split between boarding and day pupils.\\"Inquest into death of public schoolboy\\", Press Association, 22 September 1992. From 1993, as the result of a HMC initiative, Eastern European children were awarded scholarships to study at the school; by 1995, 8 per cent of the school's intake came from overseas. Michael Featherstone, a former England hockey international, was appointed headmaster in 1997, and the school enjoyed considerable academic success during his tenure. School site The Pepperpot One of the North East's most famous schools, Barnard Castle is set in its own 50-acre grounds on the edge of town. It is located in Teesdale, and is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Giles Deacon has said of the location that \\"you could just walk out and you were in the middle of the Pennines\\". The Bowes Museum is situated next to the school. The school caters for pupils aged 4 to 18, with pupils younger than 11 being taught in a separate on-site preparatory school (Prep School). The original building is now used mainly for accommodation and administration and is described as \\"stately\\" by The Independent. The school spire is known colloquially as \\"The Pepperpot\\". It also contains the dining hall and \\"Big School\\", public school slang for the school hall. All teaching is undertaken in purpose-built classrooms. The school site contains tennis/netball courts, squash courts, a large sports hall and an AstroTurf pitch. A total of ¬£3 million has been invested in the school's infrastructure since 2008, including a ¬£1.5 million Physics and ICT block, a new hall for the Prep School and a new sports pavilion containing a gym and a dance studio. The school has been used as a filming location for the television sketch show The Fast Show. Chapel The school's chapel was completed in 1911. It was designed by W. D. Caroe, and Nikolaus Pevsner described it as \\"impressive\\" both internally and externally.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Williamson, Elizabeth. County Durham, Volume 9. p.88. Somewhat unusually, it is oriented in a north‚Äìsouth direction. A large proportion of the funding to build the chapel was provided by Lord Barnard, the local nobleman and a leading freemason (with the remainder made up from public subscription), and accordingly the foundation ceremony was performed in full masonic regalia. The Grade II* listed building contains a painting by Ary Scheffer and a Father Willis organ. It has stained glass windows commemorating John Balliol and Benjamin Flounders, the two founders of the school. A roll of honour in the chapel commemorates the 141 former pupils and 4 Masters who died in the First World War, the 55 former pupils who died in the Second World War and one who died in the Falklands War.North East War Memorials Project There is a roll of honour in the main school building for the former pupils who lost their lives in the Second Boer War. Barnard Castle Preparatory School The Prep School has access to all of the facilities of the senior school. It is situated in a separate area of the school grounds with its own organisation, staff and buildings. The school is sited around a main building called Westwick Lodge, \\"a sprawling Victorian villa with the modern dormitories and classroom block hidden at the rear. It [has] a long, sloping front lawn, thickly planted with shrubberies ... Round the back [is] a playground and a muddy hill with a few trees\\". Members of the Prep School are referred to throughout the school as \\"Preppies\\". The school was founded in 1914 and was originally a girls' school, and independent from the County School. In 1989 there were just 65 pupils, all of them boys. By 2009 there were over 200 pupils, equally split between girls and boys. School on Saturdays was abolished at the Prep School in 1999. School life Intake 40 per cent of senior school intake comes from the state sector, and over 50 per cent come from the on-site Prep School. 25 per cent of Sixth Form pupil intake is from state schools. Day pupils commute from a wide catchment area that is predominantly rural in nature. These settlements are as far afield as Hurworth and Stanhope as well as larger settlements such as Kirkby Stephen, Durham, Bishop Auckland, Richmond and Darlington. Pupils are from a range of professional, managerial and farming backgrounds. There are 200 boarding pupils, significant numbers of whom have parents who are members of HM Forces, and many families are linked to nearby Catterick Garrison, Europe's largest military base.Layout 1 15 per cent of boarders have parents living overseas, particularly Hong Kong. An Open Day is held several times a year when the school welcomes prospective students and their families to tour the school.Barnard Castle School, Barnard Castle, Durham, Independent Schools Academic and routine Every weekday (except for Wednesday) begins with a chapel service. School is held on Saturday mornings, with many sporting fixtures taking place on Saturday afternoons. There is an exeat weekend every term when pupils get respite from Saturday school. The Sunday chapel service is compulsory for boarding pupils. Homework, which is always referred to as \\"prep\\", (short for preparatory work) is set for every day with the exception of Sunday. During weekdays there is a mid-morning coffee break for all pupils when refreshments are provided, a tradition from when many day pupils would arrive at that time from outlying settlements. The school uniform is traditional, including a navy blue blazer and a tie. Merits are given as rewards for outstanding work. Punishments include weekday afternoon detention and Saturday afternoon detention. Corporal punishment had to be phased out by 1987 in line with state schools, as it received public funding. The headmaster is aided in his running of the school by the monitor (prefect) system. As well as the standard subjects, Latin, Classics, Ancient History, Greek, German and Spanish are taught. The school has a strong reputation for sciences. In 2011 the Independent Schools Inspectorate described the school's ethos as \\"traditionally unpretentious\\". Pastoral Pastoral care is provided through the house system. Each pupil is assigned to a house. Each house has its own accommodation in the school and its own set of tutors to look after members of the house. There are eight vertically integrated houses in total, each with its own colour and heraldic-like shield: The two boys' boarding houses are York (red) and Northumberland (pale blue). The three-day boys' houses are Tees (dark green) and Dale (burgundy), both formed by splitting Teesdale House, the first day boys' house, and finally Durham (gold), which was converted from boarding to day when the school expanded in the 1990s. The boarding girls belong to the original Sixth Form girls' house, Longfield (dark pink), and the new houses formed for day girls when the school became co- educational are Marwood (purple) and more recently Bowes (pale green). The school considered abolishing its boarding facilities when, like many boarding schools, it suffered a significant drop in numbers during the 1990s. However, numbers unexpectedly improved around the turn of the millennium, and this turnaround has often been attributed to the positive image that boarding received from the Harry Potter series. The school is interdenominational, whilst maintaining its foundation in Christian principles and values. Governance The school is a charitable trust governed by a number of foundation and four nominated governors, the latter with links to Durham and Newcastle Universities, Durham County Council / Barnard Castle Town Council and the Old Barnardians' Club. The school aims to offer the best independent education to children from the North East of England. According to information provided to the Charities Commission, the income of the school was ¬£8.7 million in the 2017-18-year, with the vast majority of the revenue coming from school fees.BARNARD CASTLE SCHOOL :: OpenCharities It has been a member of The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference since 1944. Extracurricular activities The houses form the basis for much competition within the school. The first competition in the school year is the House Singing Competition in which every member of the school takes part. Thereafter, throughout the school year, the houses compete against each other in a variety of academic, artistic, and sporting events. An extensive range of almost 100 after-school activities are offered throughout the year, such as The Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme up to Gold level.Barnard Castle School Sport Rugby for boys and hockey for girls are the major sports during the Autumn term. In the Spring Term the boys play football, hockey and squash whilst the girls play netball and lacrosse. Both boys and girls take part in cross country running and swimming. During the Summer term, cricket is the most important sport for boys. Teams have toured Majorca and the Caribbean in recent years. Members of the 1st XI often gain representative honours for their counties and the North of England. The school was described by The Daily Telegraph as \\"one of the premier cricketing schools of the north\\". Girls focus on rounders in the summer whilst both girls and boys partake in tennis and athletics. Sports Day is a major fixture in the school calendar. Barnard Run The Barnard Run is a school competition, consisting of a cross-country trial over a hilly course. It is the most important sporting event in the school year. The course has varied considerably over the years.BBC Media Player It dates back to 1892 when Lord Barnard donated and presented the trophy.Barnard Castle School The race takes place annually at the end of the first half of the Spring Term. The girls' and younger boys' race is 2¬æ miles while the senior boys' is 4 miles. Historically the Barnard Run was a seven- mile course which began at Towler Hill Farm, ran to Cotherstone suspension bridge, with an undetermined route back to the school. In 1898 a 4-mile junior Barnard Run was created for 11- to 14-year-olds. In 1904 it was decided that it would be easier for training purposes if the run began at the school, and a new course was developed. CCF The Junior Officers' Training Corps was established at the school in 1909 following an invitation from Lord Haldane, then Secretary of State for War.Officers' Training Corps. (Hansard, 11 April 1911) By 1911 it had 103 cadets and 3 staff. In 1948 all OTCs were superseded by the Combined Cadet Force (CCF). As of 2012 it had almost 200 cadets and 10 staff, making it one of the largest contingents in the country. Facilities associated with the CCF include an armoury and an indoor shooting range. In 2012 the contingent won the Colts Canter competition, which saw it named the best force in the North of England. Rugby union The school has produced 38 U19 international rugby players, leading The Times to comment that it has \\"a happy knack of producing some of England's finest rugby talents.\\"Barnard Castle focus shifts back to England The Observer commented on the rugby success in 2008, \\"Someone should analyse what they put in the food\\". The most prominent are Rob Andrew, brothers Rory Underwood and Tony Underwood, and Mathew Tait who have all played for England at international level. Former headmaster David Ewart explained the school's rugby ethos: \\"We believe the game breeds important life skills in those who play it. It's a civilising game and you need to be a gentlemen on the pitch, as well as off.\\" During the period 1970 to 1995 no other British school produced as many England international players. In 2012 Tim Visser described his former school's rugby programme as \\"brilliant\\". The school is a prominent feeder institution for the Newcastle Falcons, with signings over the last decade including Lee Dickson, Tim Visser, Alex Tait, Ed Williamson and Rory Clegg. Recent signings to other premiership clubs include Calum Clark, Alex Gray and Ross Batty. Many Barnardians represent junior international sides, as well as the North of England, several northern county sides (such as Durham, Cumbria, Yorkshire and Cheshire) and the Independent Schools' Barbarians. The 1st VII have appeared in the final of the North of England Sevens and National Schools Sevens. The School's 1st XV team reached the final of the national Daily Mail Cup for U18s three times in five seasons between 2002/03 and 2006/07. Nicknamed the Barney Army, the team lost to Oakham School, Colston's School and Warwick School respectively in the 2002, 2003 and 2007 finals. In 2007/2008, the 1st XV were beaten in the semi-finals 19-16 by St Benedict's School. The school reached the finals of the National Schools Sevens in 2002 and 2005.

For the 1st XV cheers also take place after home victories. The team gathers in what is known as Back Porch immediately after the match and three cheers are sounded. Foundation Day: Celebrated every 6 November. Initially the Barnard Run was held on this day. Before 1892 the tradition was to celebrate the day with a paper chase, but this was replaced after Lord Barnard donated the Barnard Cup. Nailing Up: This occurs at every end of term school chapel service. Originally taking place in Central Hall, the captain of the house team which had won that term's major sporting event would climb up to his house shield displayed on the first floor balcony and nail the award to the shield. Nowadays the captain of the winning house team comes to the front of chapel and ceremonially taps the shield. \\"Jerusalem\\" is always sung at the last service of term. Speech Day: Occurring on the final day of the Summer Term (usually a Saturday) the entire school community including parents, relatives and friends of the school, meet for Speech Day. The Chairman of the Governors, the Headmaster, an invited Speaker and the Head of School make speeches, and academic prizes are awarded to pupils.

The records of his life are scanty. He was connected with the command of Indian troops under the British and had some connections with Kanhoji Angre. He paid for the reconstruction of the Walkeshwar Temple in 1715 and also donated a temple on Parsi Bazaar Street. He was clearly friendly with the British, since he is on record as one of the honoured guests at the inauguration of St. Thomas' Cathedral on Christmas Day, 1718. Unfortunately Charles Boone found a piece of paper that said that Kamat was working with Boones archenemy-Kanhoji Angre. The paper was just a forgery by one of Kamat's jealous friends but Boone was so angry that he tortured and killed Kamat and then just one day later it was found out that Kamat never helped Angre and Boone paid money to Kamat's family hoping for forgiveness.

OÃ£ba'lumoÃ£, emigrated from the ancient √íÃ£b√† civilization in northeastern Yorubaland. Foundation and development Obalumo, a prince of the Oba civilization, and a veteran hunter and warrior, founded √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥, his new city-state in one of the areas of his frequent hunting expeditions. Recent archaeological research results (and published works of oral history experts, anthropologists and archaeologists of the Arizona State University, USA and the University of Ibadan, Nigeria); of the region's contemporary and later settlements suggest that √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ was founded between the 10th and the 12th centuries by √íÃ£b√† refugees probably fleeing from both internal dissension in their √íb√† kingdom as well as the cyclic conflicts of their ·ªåÃÄb√† kingdom with the neighbouring kingdoms, perhaps including the Nupe to the north. At its zenith towards the end of the 15th century, √ås√®d√≥ had grown into a city-state of 13 clans, some of which were later \\"consolidants\\" into the Obalumo's kingdom at √ås√®d√≥ and were not of the ancient Oba origin. New arrivals Some oral-historians indicate that at the request of an arriving faction from Ila- Yara, the city-state founded by √ír√†ng√∫n, Oduduwa's fourth son, the region's king, ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ gave land-grants to the new arrivals at a location thought to be sufficiently distant from √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥'s location. Another version of the oral history, which seems more reliable, indicates that the land-grant occurred a few centuries later, when the faction of the younger of two quarreling princes arrived in the vicinity of the ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ's √ås√®d√≥ kingdom, from the schism at their old kingdom at √ål√° Y√†r√†. Arutu Oluokun, the younger of the feuding princes, founded a settlement at the Ila-Magbon, but the new kingdom moved within a short time to found another city called Ila-Odo closer to Isedo, which subsists as the modern √ål√° √ír√†ng√∫n. Consolidation and accommodation An annual celebration called \\"√åm√°r√∫gb√≥\\" (or \\"√ík√πnr√¨n\\") festival was instituted between the two city-states during which the King ·ªåÃÄr√†ng√∫n leaves his palace with his chiefs to pay a day-long homage to his primogenitor, the King ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ in his (the ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ's) palace. This is in symbolic tribute to ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ's land grant and precedence of him in the region, in appreciation of ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ's hosting of the √ír√†ng√∫n's elderly mother who could not continue with the immigrant party to the location of their allocated land. The ·ªåÃÄr√†ng√∫n's mother died in the palace of the ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ and was buried at √ås√®d√≥. So the ·ªåÃÄr√†ng√∫n also visits her grave as part of this festival. While it has maintained the royal title of Oba'l√∫m√≤, the kingdom of √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ has in modern times been virtually engulfed by the present-day Ila OÃ£rangun such that the old Isedo township now lies (at ), in the southeast quadrant of Ila Orangun. In Oke-Ila, the oratures of the ·ªåba√°l√° clan refer to their origin from √ås√®d√≥, indicating that they are actually a segment of the √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ royalty which emigrated several centuries ago to an alliance with Apakiimo, the last Orangun at Ila Yara kingdom to found his (Orangun's) new kingdom now known as Oke-Ila. In this five-centuries-old quasi-consolidation treaty to help found with the new Oke-Ila Orangun state, the √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ immigrants \\"of the hilltop\\" (Isedo Oke or Isedo Ori Oke)were retained their royal title of ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ, and subsequently were accorded a new recognition (possibly for their foremost contribution to the establishment of the new kingdom), awarding their clan the title of OÃ£ba√°l√° (\\"mighty king\\" or \\"senior king\\"), a title next in rank to the √íÃ£r√†ng√∫n of Oke-Ila the paramount king. The ·ªåba√°l√° is also designated as the automatic regent upon the demise of any reigning ·ªåÃÄr√†ng√∫n. Heritage and diaspora The √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ clans retain references in their oratures to their ancestry from √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ and the ancient ·ªåÃÄb√† kingdom, and citing their descent from King ·ªåba'l√∫m·ªçÃÄ of √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ and King Olunlakin of ·ªåÃÄb√† as well as nostalgically referring to themselves as \\"children of the great wealth\\" of ·ªåÃÄb√†. Other examples of Igbomina and non-Igbomina towns (in Kwara and OÃ£sÃ£un states of Nigeria) with large concentrations of ·ªåÃÄb√† people, now commonly called 'The √íÃ£b√† Diaspora', include the following: Oke-Ila OÃ£rangun, Ila OÃ£rangun, OÃ£ra-Igbomina, Ipoti-Ekiti, Isanlu-Isin, Oke-Onigbin, Omu-Aran, Ror·∫π, ·ªåyan, Inisha, Ipee, Oke-Ode, Babanla, Ajas·∫π-Ipo, Omupo, Esi·∫π, Oro, Ijomu-Oro, Iddo-Oro, Idofin, Ado-Eku, Oreke, Sanmora, and Pamo. The √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ clans appear to be the earliest surviving [but perhaps not the only] group in 'The √íÃ£b√† Diaspora' that purposefully set out and founded a surviving kingdom ruled by the king OÃ£ba'lumoÃ£. Subsequent ·ªåÃÄb√†-derivative kingdoms and diasporas appear to have resulted solely from refugee flights from wars and slave raids. √ås·∫πÃÄd√≥ communities resulting from the diaspora of such wars exist in Ipoti-Ekiti, and other Igbomina and Ekiti towns as well as Omido (Kwara State) and other towns in Kwara State. Isedo and Oba diaspora tourism  The legends of origin and of emigrations of the Isedo from Oba has been a major effort of His Royal Highness, Dr. Ol√∫f·∫πÃÅmi ·ªål√°d√†p·ªçÃÄ Babal·ªçl√°. He has also been active since 2004 in promoting tourism (heritage tourism/cultural tourism and geo-tourism), and planning tourist expeditions to the various Isedo and Oba heritage sites and physiographic features and cultural performances/traditional occupations of the Igbomina-Yoruba and adjoining Yoruba areas. He has led various special tours to the various old sites, ruins and existing towns and historical places of Yorubaland, especially of the Igbomina-Yoruba region, verifying oral history and oral poetry of various clans and ancient kingdoms.

It is the official sanctioning body, recognised by FIQ, the sport's world governing body, for all competitions, leagues and tournaments held in the UK, and is the organisation responsible for the protection, integrity and development of the sport. It also oversees coaching for tenpin bowling at all levels, and is the official awarding body for formal coaching qualifications. The BTBA had a monthly magazine to keep members up to date with the latest news in the sport but nowadays news can mainly be found on Facebook. History The first British tenpin bowling centre opened at Stamford Hill. The two principal American manufacturers of tenpin machinery - AMF and Brunswick - had expanded their operations to the UK when it became apparent that they had virtually saturated their home market in the US at the end of the 1950s. The American Bowling Congress (ABC) took an interest in this expansion and helped British bowlers to set up their own governing body. The BTBA was formed on 26 May 1961 The General Secretary was Maurice Glazer, at that time a professional photographer in Dalston, East London. His shop became the first official residence of the Association. One of its original roles was to provide official recognition for newcomers to the fledgling sport of tenpin bowling as it grew in popularity across the UK. It standardised rules and playing regulations, laid down guidelines and provided an independent governing body to which reference could be made in the event of disagreement. The rule-book was copied almost verbatim from the ABC version. The annual membership subscription was five shillings), which at the prevailing exchange rate was the Sterling equivalent of the ABC's annual subscription of US$1. With about half-a-million members the ABC found this rate to provide them with adequate funds, but it was insufficient to run the BTBA, given that only a few thousand British bowlers were members. Authority was delegated to each of the counties under the auspices of local area representatives. Some of the area representatives soon came into conflict with the bowling centre proprietors, for example insisting on costly re-surfacing of lanes, which they argued was unnecessary. The proprietors rebelled and set up their own rival organisation, the Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association (TBPA), in 1967. An Annual General Meeting of the BTBA saw this conflict rise to a head and most of the governing council resigned, leaving Glazer to regroup and bring back all decisions to the BTBA head office. It took several years to achieve a rapprochement with the proprietors. Glazer continued to follow his instincts in what he believed to be the best interest of British bowlers, became President of FIQ and was awarded an MBE for his service to the sport. The BTBA has continued to have a considerable impact on the sport.

Similar to the Carnatic gottuvadhyam (chitra vina) it has no frets and is played with a slide.http://www.vichiterveena.com/instrument.htm The structure The Vichitra Veena is the modern form of ancient Ektantri Veena. It is made of a broad, fretless, horizontal arm or crossbar (dand) around three feet long and six inches wide, with two large resonating gourds (tumba), which are inlaid with ivory and attached underneath at either end. The narrow ends of the instrument are fashioned into peacock heads, the national bird of India. The strings There are four main playing strings and five secondary strings (chikaris), which are played openly with the little finger for a drone effect. Underneath them are 13 sympathetic strings tuned to the notes of the appropriate raag. The veena has a five-octave range. Two plectrums (mizrab) identical to those used for sitar are worn on the middle and index fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings, and a glass ball (batta) is moved with the left across the main strings to create melody (there can be a distance of up to two inches between notes). Coconut oil is put on the strings to minimize the friction of the sliding hand holding the batta. The veena was often used to accompany the Dhrupad style of singing and this did not allow for much intricacy or embellishment around the notes. It was rescued from oblivion by Lalmani Misra who developed technique of playing and created Misrabani compositions; his son Gopal Shankar Misra made the repertoire universal. Artists * Gopal Krishan, (1926 - 2004) disciple of Nand Kishore Sharma. A deep understanding of the raga and a depth presentation by weaving of various intricate musical patterns and its rhythmic synchronisation is his speciality. He specialised in a technique called \\"Jhala\\" (very difficult to play on this instrument),which gives a climactic effect to the performance for the grand finale. * Lalmani Misra, (1924 - 1979) A perfectionist, he modified the instrument for better quality of renditions of Khayals and Thumris. He even played Dadras on the Veena. He created numerous Ragas, Madhukali being the most famous. He was inspired by Ustad Abdul Aziz Khan. * Gopal Shankar Misra, (1957 - 1999) Son and student of Lalmani Mishra. * Ragini Trivedi (b. 1960) * Brahm Sarup Singh, (1940 - 1998) was a renowned player of vichitra veena.

They have released three albums: 2001's \\"Wildflowers\\" (Platinum), \\"Karma Calling\\" (Gold) in 2003 (both of these were on the EMI Ireland label), and \\"Connected\\" in 2011. \\"Wildflowers Karma Calling was released as a double album package by Universal Records (Ireland) in 2015. The band are perhaps best known for the songs \\"Rainbow Zephyr\\" and \\"You I'm Thinking Of\\", from their debut album, Wildflowers. The former (a big Irish radio hit in its own right) was covered by Westlife with slightly changed lyrics and released as a single \\"Hey Whatever\\", which went on to become an international hit. Relish were fully formed by the mid 1990s when bass player Darren Campbell teamed up with the brothers. The band signed to EMI in 1998 and immediately caught the attention of famed producer John Leckie (The Stone Roses, Radiohead). Fans of the band include Brian May of Queen and Larry Mullen Jr of U2. History Upbringing The Papenfus brothers are sons of South African jazz singer Jane Londis (of Golden City Dixies fame) and doctor of psychology, author and percussionist Stan Papenfus. Their parents fled South Africa whose apartheid system deemed their inter-racial marriage illegal and settled in Belfast, Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. The Papenfus' sons early musical upbringing was augmented by their parents record collection of jazz, gospel + world music and 1960s rock; their only possession brought from South Africa. Early bands and Relish formation Pre-Relish musical outfits included 50/50 (half cover versions/half original) with Steaf√°n Hanvey and grunge + funk metal band The Id. Darren Campbell joined the band and Relish was formed from the ashes of The Id after the departure of keyboard player, and vocalist Brendan Kelly. Reduced to a 3 piece outfit, all members took up vocal duties with Ken reluctantly assuming lead vocals and named themselves Relish in 1995. After three years of consistent demoing, gigging and building relationships with labels, one demo struck a chord that had record labels visiting the Relish rehearsal room in their home town of Downpatrick. Releases EMI years Wildflowers Following a series of auditions in the Papenfus' living room in front of a bemused number of record company A&R; personnel, the band signed to EMI Ireland in 1998 and began work on their debut album \\"Wildflowers\\" with acclaimed producer John Leckie ( Stone Roses, Radiohead), in UK studios Rockfield, Air and Abbey Road studios. Al Clay (Stereophonics, Pixies) was commissioned to produce and mix the next phase of recording at BJG and Windmill Lane studios in Ireland. The 2001 release debuted at No 6 in the Irish charts and was well received in both the UK and Ireland. It spawned a top 10 and two top 30 singles, and a No1 in the airplay charts in Japan with \\"You I'm Thinking Of\\" The album, and particularly its lead singles, \\"Let It Fly\\" and \\"Rainbow Zephyr\\", brimmed over with direct soul and gospel influences, soft in tone but with a clear rock edge. '' Karma Calling Karma Calling was released in 2003 debuting at No. 8 in the Irish charts. Produced by Al Clay it achieved a No11 Irish hit single with 'Father, Brother, Lover and Son. During this period live slots included appearances at Scotland's T in the Park, the V Festival, Japan's Summer Sonic Festival, and by personal invitation by U2's Larry Mullen Jr. at Ireland's Slane Castle. Post EMI years Connected On 19 November 2010 Relish performed their first live gig in five years. It was a charity fund raiser for Brendan Kelly, former band member and ex lead vocalist of The Id. On October 2011 a new album called \\"Connected\\" received a low key UK + Ireland release on their own label Zephyr Sounds licensed to US label Rock Ridge Music/ADA Warners (which included radio hits \\"Something To Believe In\\", \\"Connected\\" and \\"Together You\\") to positive reviews. Written, recorded, engineered, produced and mixed (almost entirely) by the Papenfus brothers, it was a heavily revised version of \\"Three Times\\"; a Japanese only release through CCRE Entertainment in 2009.

In any action in which a wrong is alleged to have been done to a company, the proper claimant is the company itself. This is known as \\"the rule in Foss v Harbottle\\", and the several important exceptions that have been developed are often described as \\"exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle\\". Amongst these is the \\"derivative action\\", which allows a minority shareholder to bring a claim on behalf of the company. This applies in situations of \\"wrongdoer control\\" and is, in reality, the only true exception to the rule. The rule in Foss v Harbottle is best seen as the starting point for minority shareholder remedies. The rule has now largely been partly codified and displaced in the United Kingdom by the Companies Act 2006 sections 260‚Äì263, setting out a statutory derivative claim. Facts Richard Foss and Edward Starkie Turton were two minority shareholders in the \\"Victoria Park Company\\". The company had been set up in September 1835 to buy of land near Manchester and, according to the report, > enclosing and planting the same in an ornamental and park-like manner, and > erecting houses thereon with attached gardens and pleasure-grounds, and > selling, letting or otherwise disposing thereof. This became Victoria Park, Manchester. Subsequently, an Act of Parliament incorporated the company.This read \\"An Act for Establishing a Company for the Purpose of Laying Out and Maintaining an Ornamental Park within the Townships of Rusholme, Charlton-upon-Medlock and Moss Side, in the County of Lancaster\\". It received Royal assent on the 5 May 1837 (7 Will 4). The claimants alleged that property of the company had been misapplied and wasted and various mortgages were given improperly over the company's property. They asked that the guilty parties be held accountable to the company and that a receiver be appointed. The defendants were the five company directors (Thomas Harbottle, Joseph Adshead, Henry Byrom, John Westhead, Richard Bealey) and the solicitors and architect (Joseph Denison, Thomas Bunting and Richard Lane); and also H. Rotton, E. Lloyd, T. Peet, J. Biggs and S. Brooks, the several assignees of Byrom, Adshead and Westhead, who had become bankrupts. Judgment Wigram VC dismissed the claim and held that when a company is wronged by its directors it is only the company that has standing to sue. In effect the court established two rules. Firstly, the \\"proper plaintiff rule\\" is that a wrong done to the company may be vindicated by the company alone. Secondly, the \\"majority rule principle\\" states that if the alleged wrong can be confirmed or ratified by a simple majority of members in a general meeting, then the court will not interfere (legal term). Developments The rule was later extended to cover cases where what is complained of is some internal irregularity in the operation of the company. However, the internal irregularity must be capable of being confirmed/sanctioned by the majority. The rule in Foss v Harbottle has another important implication. A shareholder cannot generally bring a claim to recover any reflective loss ‚Äì a diminution in the value of his or her shares in circumstances where the diminution arises because the company has suffered an actionable loss. The proper course is for the company to bring the action and recoup the loss with the consequence that the value of the shares will be restored. Because Foss v Harbottle leaves the minority in an unprotected position, exceptions have arisen and statutory provisions have come into being which provide some protection for the minority. By far and away the most important protection is the unfair prejudice action in ss. 994-6 of the Companies Act 2006 (UK) (s 232 Corporations Act 2001 in Australia). Also, there is a new statutory derivate action available under ss 260‚Äì269 of the 2006 Act (and s 236 Corporations Act 2001 in Australia). Exceptions to the rule There are certain exceptions to the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, where litigation will be allowed. The following exceptions protect basic minority rights, which are necessary to protect regardless of the majority's vote. ;1. Ultra vires and illegality The directors of a company, or a shareholding majority may not use their control of the company to paper over actions which would be ultra vires the company, or illegal. *s 39 Companies Act 2006 for the rules on corporate capacity *Smith v Croft (No 2) and Cockburn v. Newbridge Sanitary Steam Laundry Co. [1915] 1 IR 237, 252‚Äì59 (per O'Brien LC and Holmes LJ) for the illegality point ;2. Actions requiring a special majority If some special voting procedure would be necessary under the company's constitution or under the Companies Act, it would defeat both if that could be sidestepped by ordinary resolutions of a simple majority, and no redress for aggrieved minorities to be allowed. *Edwards v Halliwell [1950] 2 All ER 1064 ;3.

Until the Balkan Wars in 1912‚Äì1913, there was only an unmanned pier used to export wood and charcoal on the site. Kiten was founded in 1931 by 30 families of Bulgarian refugees from Eastern Thrace who resettled there from the newly founded refugee village of Fazanovo. However, the area has roots from antiquity, as amphoras from the 6th century BCE were found on the south beach (Urdoviza). Kiten was declared a national resort in 1962, and since 1981 it had been administratively a quarter of nearby Primorsko. On 17 June 2005 the former village was proclaimed a separate town in order to more effectively cope with the growing number of tourists, primarily from Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Serbia, Russia and Germany.BOURGAS, the City on the Black Sea Coast Atliman beach Honour Kiten Point on Graham Land in Antarctica is named after the town.

As of 2010 Kendall-Jackson was the highest-selling brand of \\"super- premium\\" wine (retailing for more than US$15 per bottle) in the United States. History Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, California; August 2007. In 1974, San Francisco land-use attorney Jess Jackson and his wife Jane Kendall Wadlow Jackson converted an pear and walnut orchard in Lakeport, California to a vineyard and sold wine grapes to local wineries. In 1982, a downturn in the grape market led them to produce their own wine instead of selling the grapes, and the Kendall-Jackson brand was established. That label now continues under the umbrella company, Jackson Family Wines, that Jackson later created. In the 1980s, Kendall-Jackson rejected the California wine industry's trend toward vineyard-specific wine labeling. It ignored the concept of terroir in favor of blending wines from different regions to achieve desired wine characteristics. They reversed that direction in the mid-2000s, along with a push to upgrade their quality. After retiring from Hewlett-Packard, Lew Platt was the company's CEO from 2000 to mid-2001. In late 2006, the Jackson family launched White Rocket Wine Co. in Napa Valley to target the millennial generation of wine drinkers. In April 2011 Jess Jackson died from cancer at the age of 81. His son-in-law, Don Hartford, had been serving as CEO of the company. The company disclosed a succession plan in March 2011, announcing that president Rick Tigner would be transitioning into the position of CEO. Tigner was featured on the third season, second episode of Undercover Boss. Don Hartford and Barbara Banke oversee the family's interests on the board of directors.

It is named after the Hindu goddess Saraswati, who is usually depicted holding or playing the instrument. Also known as raghunatha veena is used mostly in Carnatic Indian classical music. There are several variations of the veena, which in its South Indian form is a member of the lute family. One who plays the veena is referred to as a vainika. The Saraswati veena is one of major types of veena today. The others include chitra veena, vichitra veena and rudra veena. Out of these the rudra and vichitra veenas are used more often in Hindustani music, while the Saraswati veena and the chitra veena are used more frequently in the Carnatic music of South India. They can be used to play either traditional music or contemporary music. History The veena has a recorded history that dates back to the approximately 1700 BCE In ancient times, the tone vibrating from the hunter's bow string when he shot an arrow was known as the Vil Yazh. The Jya ghosha (musical sound of the bow string) is referred to in the ancient Atharvaveda. Eventually, the archer's bow paved the way for the musical bow. Twisted bark, strands of grass and grass root, vegetable fibre and animal gut were used to create the first strings. Over the veena's evolution and modifications, more particular names were used to help distinguish the instruments that followed. The word veena in India was a term originally used to generally denote \\"stringed instrument\\", and included many variations that would be either plucked, bowed or struck for sound.Bonnie C. Wade (2004). \\"Music in India\\". Manohar, 90-93.Padma Bhushan Prof. P. Sambamurthy (2005). \\"History of Indian Music\\". The Indian Music Publishing House, 208-214. The veena instruments developed much like a tree, branching out into instruments as diverse as the harp-like Akasa (a veena that was tied up in the tops of trees for the strings to vibrate from the currents of wind) and the Audumbari veena (played as an accompaniment by the wives of Vedic priests as they chanted during ceremonial Yajnas). Veenas ranged from one string to one hundred and were composed of many different materials like eagle bone, bamboo, wood, and coconut shells. The yazh was an ancient harp-like instrument that was also considered a veena. But with the developments of the fretted veena instruments, the yazh quickly faded away, as the fretted veena allowed for the easy performance of ragas and the myriad subtle nuances and pitch oscillations in the gamakas prevalent in the Indian musical system.<, ref name=\\"Padma Bhushan Prof 2005\\"/> As is seen in many Hindu temple sculptures and paintings, the early veenas were played vertically. It was not until the great Indian Carnatic music composer and Saraswati veena player Muthuswami Dikshitar that it began to be popularized as played horizontally. \\"The current form of the Saraswati veena with 24 fixed frets evolved in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, during the reign of Raghunatha Nayak and it is for this reason sometimes called the Tanjore veena or the Raghunatha veena. The Saraswati veena contains 4 strings. It is said Govinda Dikshita father of Venkatamukhin, who was a musician and a minister in the court of Raghunatha Nayaka designed it. Prior to his time, the number of frets on the veena was less and also movable.\\" - Padmabhooshan Prof. P. Sambamurthy, musicologist.Padma Bhushan Prof. P. Sambamurthy (2005). \\"History of Indian Music\\". The Indian Music Publishing House, 203. The Saraswati veena developed from Kinnari Veena. Made in several regions in South India, those made by makers from Thanjavur in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu are to date considered the most sophisticated. However, the purest natural sound is extracted by plucking with natural fingernails on a rosewood instrument construction, which is exemplified by the grandeur of the Mysore Veena. Pitampura in East Godavari District and Bobbili in Vijayanagara District of Andhra Pradesh is also famous for Veena makers. Sangeeta Ratnakara calls it Ekatantri Veena and gives the method for its construction. While the Saraswati veena is considered in the lute genealogy, other North Indian veenas such as the Rudra veena and Vichitra veena are technically zithers. Descendants of Tansen reserved Rudra Veena for family and out of reverence began calling it the Saraswati Veena. Construction Tuning Pegs (Kunti) of Saraswati Veena About four feet in length, its design consists of a large resonator (kudam) carved and hollowed out of a log (usually of jackfruit wood), a tapering hollow neck (dandi) topped with 24 brass or bell-metal frets set in scalloped black wax on wooden tracks, and a tuning box culminating in a downward curve and an ornamental dragon's head (yali).If the veena is built from a single piece of wood it is called (Ekantha) veena. A small table-like wooden bridge (kudurai)--about 2 x 2¬Ω x 2 inches--is topped by a convex brass plate glued in place with resin. Two rosettes, formerly of ivory, now of plastic or horn, are on the top board (palakai) of the resonator. Four main playing strings tuned to the tonic and the fifth in two octaves (for example, B flat-E flat below bass clef - B flat- E flat in bass clef) stretch from fine tuning connectors attached to the end of the resonator across the bridge and above the fretboard to four large-headed pegs in the tuning box. Three subsidiary drone strings tuned to the tonic, fifth, and upper tonic (E flat - B flat- E flat in the tuning given above) cross a curving side bridge leaning against the main bridge, and stretch on the player's side of the neck to three pegs matching those of the main playing strings. All seven strings today are of steel, with the lower strings either solid thick. Playing technique Close up of a veena being played. The veena is played by sitting cross-legged with the instrument held tilted slightly away from the player. The small gourd on the left rests on the player's left thigh, the left arm passing beneath the neck with the hand curving up and around so that the fingers rest upon the frets. The palm of the right hand rests on the edge of the top plank so that the fingers (usually index and middle) can pluck the strings. The drone strings are played with the little finger. The veena's large resonator is placed on the floor, beyond the right thigh. The photo of Veenai Dhanammal more accurately illustrates how the veena is held than the more fanciful Ravi Varma painting. Like the sitar, the left hand technique involves playing on the frets, controlled pushing on the strings to achieve higher tones and glissandi through increased tension, and finger flicks, all reflecting the characteristics of various ragas and their ornamentation (gamaka). Modern innovations include one or two circular sound holes (like that of the lute), substitution of machine heads for wooden pegs for easier tuning, and the widespread use of transducers for amplification in performance. Religious associations within Hinduism Goddess Saraswati depicted playing the veena The patron Hindu Goddess of learning and the arts, Saraswati, is often depicted seated upon a swan playing a veena. Lord Shiva is also depicted playing or holding a vina in His form called \\"Vinadhara,\\" which means \\"bearer of the vina.\\" Also, the great Hindu sage Narada was known as a veena maestro.Bhag-P 1.5.1 Narada is addressed as 'Vina-panih', meaning \\"one who carries a vina in his hand\\" and refers to 19 different kinds of Veena in Sangita Makarandha. Ravana, the antagonist of the Ramayana, who is also a great scholar, a capable ruler and a devoted follower of Shiva, was also a versatile veena player. Scholars hold that as Saraswati is the goddess of learning, the most evolved string instrument in a given age was placed in her hands by contemporary artistes. References in ancient texts and literature The Ramayana, the Bhagavata, the Puranas and Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra all contain references to the Veena, as well as the Sutra and the Aranyaka. The Vedic sage Yajnavalkya speaks of the greatness of the Veena in the following verse: \\"One who is skilled in Veena play, one who is an expert in the varieties of srutis (quarter tones) and one who is proficient in tala attain salvation without effort.\\"Padma Bhushan Prof. P. Sambamurthy (2005). \\"History of Indian Music\\". The Indian Music Publishing House, 202, 205, 207. Many references to the veena are made in old Sanskrit and Tamil literature, such as Lalita Sahasranama, Adi Shankara's Soundarya Lahari, poet Kalidasa's epic Sanskrit poem Kumarasambhava and Shyamala Dandakam, and Tamil Thevarams and the Thiruvasagamhttp://egayathri.blogspot.my/2009/04/nada-yoga_15.html to name a few. Examples include \\"veena venu mridanga vAdhya rasikAm\\" in Meenakshi Pancharathnam, \\"mAsil veeNaiyum mAlai madhiyamum\\" Thevaram by Appar.\\"See above\\". Veena or the Hindu goddesses playing the veena i.e. Saraswathi and Shakti have also been referred to as kachchapi (in the Lalitha Sahasranama for example)http://www.vignanam.org/veda/sree-lalita-sahasra-nama-stotram- english.html or vipanchi (in the Soundarya Lahari) in Sanskrit texts. Musical compositions like Tyagaraja's Mokshamugaladha contain philosophies about the spiritual aspects of the veena.http://www.karnatik.com/c1291.shtml Each physical portion of the veena is said to be the seat in which subtle aspects of various gods and goddesses reside in Hinduism. The instrument's neck is Shiva, the strings constitute his consort, Parvati. The bridge is Lakshmi, the secondary gourd is Brahma, the dragon head Vishnu. And upon the resonating body is Saraswati. \\"Thus, the veena is the abode of divinity and the source of all happiness.\\"- R. Rangaramanuja AyyangarBonnie C. Wade (2004). \\"Music in India\\". Manohar, 93. Eminent veena player E. Gayathri has mentioned in many interviews that the Aitareya Upanishad contains a verse stating that human beings are the veena created by God (daiva veena) and the wooden Saraswati veena is the man-made veena (maanushi veena). According to her, the veena is resemblant of the human skeleton, where the resonating kudam represents the skull, the dandi and the lion (Yali) face the human backbone, and the twenty- four frets on the fretboard representing the 24 vertebrae of the human spine. Variants Scholars consider that today four instruments are signified by Veena which in the past has been used as generic name for all string instruments. They are the Tanjavur (Saraswati) Veena, Rudra veena, Vichitra veena, and Gottuvadhyam veena (also called the Chitra veena). Modern day evolving of the veena include the Sruti veena (more an instrument for theoretical demonstration than for actual playing) that was constructed by Dr. Lalmani Misra in early 1960s on which all 22 srutis can be produced simultaneously,.Shruti Veena: the Sound Link Contemporary situation Veena represents the system of Indian music. Several instruments evolved in response to cultural changes in the country. Communities of artists, scholars and craftsmen moved around and at times settled down. Thus Veena craftsmen of Kolkata were famous for their instruments. Similarly, Rudra Veena was given a new form which came to be known after the craftsmen of Tanjavur as Tanjavur Veena. Modern life-style is no longer limited to definite routine within a small locality, thus along with performers and teachers of Veena, the community of craftsmen is also on decline.Forbes India: The last notes of Thanjavur Veena Attempts to start institutions of instrument-making have been made, but there is a strong need for conservatories which focus on all aspects of Veena. As a state party to UNESCO Convention 2003, India has identified Veena as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage and proposed its inscription in the Representative list of UNESCO. Electronic and Digital veena: Over the years, the acoustic Tanjavur veena (also known as Saraswati veena) has been used in solo and duet concerts in large auditoria. Performers have also been travelling across the globe for concerts. Many practitioners of the art live outside India. The challenges faced by them in using the acoustic veena: 1\\\\. Low sound output (volume) compared to other louder instruments like flute or violin, causing the sound of the veena to be almost inaudible in concerts comprising other instruments along with the veena. This necessitated use of a contact mike (pioneered by Emani Sankara Sastri) or magnetic pickup (pioneered by S.Balachander). Usage of these requires carrying an additional amplispeaker to enable audibility to the performer. 2\\\\. Fragility of the acoustic instrument, causing frequent breakage and damage during travel. 3\\\\. Requirement of re-fretting every year or so, necessitating either carrying the instrument back to India or facilitating the travel and stay overseas, of the skilled artisan from India for this specific purpose. All these factors led to the creation of the rudimentary electric veena, followed by the electronic veena(1986) and digital veena (2002) by the engineer-flautist G Raj Narayan of Bengaluru.(1971)Electric veenaEarly Electronic veena The main characteristics of the electronic veena: Enhanced volume, with the amplifier and speaker built into one of the gourds; Built-in electronic tambura for sruti in the other removable gourd; Matched pick-up and amplispeaker to enable authentic sweet veena sound; Adjustable independent volume control for main and taala strings; Adjustable frets on a wooden fret board, eliminating the more delicate wax fret board, frets can be adjusted easily by the user; Guitar-type keys for easy and accurate tuning; Complete portability, as the sound box of the veena is dispensed with, and replaced by a plank of wood. Easy assembly / disassembly; Usage on battery in case of AC Mains power failure. The electronic veena has gained popularity among users of the instrument. Videos of electronic veena concerts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qp6dhg3anY; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKKxyddXUk; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8i4PW1z7SE; http://musicnagari.com/ladies- tanpura https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv5l0VNopDU However, this did not solve other issues such as need for repeated retuning while playing, change of strings for playing on higher pitch, mismatch of same note on different strings, etc. This led to the invention of the Digital veena (for which the inventor G Raj Narayan was awarded a patent by the Indian Patent office),demonstrated at the Madras Music Academy in 2002. This is the first synthesiser for Indian music, and its salient features are:Photo of demonstration of digital veenaDigital veena Patent File:digiveena-2013.jpg|thumb] Can be used at any pitch without changing strings; All four strings and tala strings tuned automatically and perfectly on selection of ANY pitch; Selection of PA / MA for mandara panchamam and taala panchamam strings ‚Äì PA will change to MA on open string but first fret will still be Suddha Dhaivatam; String will not change sruti while playing (frequency / sruti will not reduce or increase); Gamakam response adjustment ‚Äì can be set for high response to smaller transverse deflection of finger or small response to more deflection. e.g., Selection can be made so that with a moderate pull of string, five-note gamakam can be achieved on the same fret; Enhanced volume, with the amplifier and speaker built-in to one of the gourds, adjustable volume; Increased sustenance of notes; thus long passages can be played with fewer plucks, adjustable ‚Äòsustain‚Äô to suit a user‚Äôs style; 8 ‚Äòvoice‚Äô choices ( types of sound) ‚Äì e.g. Tanjore veena, mandolin, saxophone, flute, etc.; Fixed frets on a wooden fret board, eliminating the more delicate wax fret board. No setting of melam. Digitally preset fret positions for perfect frequency of each note; Built-in electronic tambura for sruti and line-out facility, battery back-up in case of AC Mains power failure; Complete portability, as the sound box of the veena is dispensed with, and replaced by a detachable gourd with an ampli-speaker with easy assembly / disassembly. The digital veena has also been used in junior/ amateur concerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL78310529B34D2B20; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1DC8992449F99704; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPntK9cnRa695tzMidqD7r6CODCjrX3Gj Tone and acoustics Nobel Prize-winning physicist C.V. Raman has described the veena as having a unique construction. The string terminations at both ends are curved and not sharp. Also, the frets have much more curvature than any other instrument. Unlike in guitar, the string does not have to be pushed down to the very base of the neck, so no rattling sound is generated. This design enables a continuous control over the string tension, which is important for glissandi. The beeswax beneath the frets may act as a noise filter.

The Catholic Church in Ethiopia is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The Oriental Ethiopian Catholic Church, the primary organization of Catholicism in the country, is especially close to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, whose doctrine and liturgical tradition it shares. While separated by their understanding of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, the Ethiopian Catholic and Orthodox Churches have basically the same sacraments and liturgy. As of 2010, there were 610,714 members of the Ethiopian Catholic Church. There are also a small number of Latin-Rite Catholics in the country, primarily Italian Ethiopians. History Around the year 341 A.D., Saint Frumentius (Abune Salama Kesatie Berhan) was consecrated the first Bishop of Ethiopia by the great Saint Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria, who was in union with the Bishop of Rome. Thus the Bishop of Alexandria was the bridge between the Bishop of Rome and the Bishop of Ethiopia. When the Church in Alexandria and in Ethiopia split from the Church in Rome in the sixth century, the Church which had been one became divided. Between the 13th - 18th centuries, various consistent missionary attempts had been carried out in Ethiopia to re-introduce Catholicism. Since there was already a Christian church in the Country, most of the missionary attempts were not concerned with the conversion of the non-Christians, but securing the adhesion to the Holy See of the existing Church. Yet these missions eventually failed due to the national-religious attachment of the Ethiopians, in particular, the Coptic party, to their Miaphysite doctrine, and the strict link between religious and political struggles. The Portuguese voyages of discovery at the end of the fifteenth century opened the way for direct contacts between the Church in Rome and the Church in Ethiopia. Due largely to the behaviour of the Portuguese Jesuit Afonso Mendes, whom Pope Urban VIII appointed as Patriarch of Ethiopia in 1622, Emperor Fasilides expelled the Patriarch and the European missionaries, who included Jer√≥nimo Lobo, from the country in 1636; these contacts, which had seemed destined for success under the previous Emperor led, instead, to the complete closure of Ethiopia to further contact with Rome. From 1839 Msgr. Justin de Jacobis, and subsequently Cardinal Guglielmo Massaia, resumed Catholic missionary activities. The Catholic communities currently found in Ethiopia are mostly the fruit of the vigorous work of the above-mentioned missionaries, de Jacobis, and Cardinal Massaja.

The Santebal was in charge of internal security and running prison camps like Tuol Sleng (S-21) where thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured and killed. It was part of the Khmer Rouge organizational structure well before 17 April 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took control over Cambodia. The name is an amalgam of two words: santisuk meaning security and norkorbal meaning police. History As early as 1971, the Khmer Rouge established the Special Zone outside of Phnom Penh under the direction of Vorn Vet and Son Sen. Son Sen, later the Deputy Prime Minister for Defence of Democratic Kampuchea, was also in charge of the Santebal, and in that capacity he appointed Comrade Duch to run its security apparatus. Most of the Santebal's deputies, such as Comrade Chan and Comrade Pon, hailed from Kampong Thom, Duch's native province.Ben Kiernan, The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979. Page 315 When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, Duch moved his headquarters to Phnom Penh and reported directly to Son Sen. At that time, a small chapel in the capital was used to incarcerate the regime's prisoners, who totaled fewer than two hundred. In May 1976, Duch moved his headquarters to its final location, a former high school known as Tuol Sleng, which could hold up to 1,500 prisoners. It was at Tuol Sleng that the major purges of Khmer Rouge cadres took place and thousands of prisoners were tortured and killed. Between 1976 and 1978, 20,000 Cambodians were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng. Of this number only seven adults are known to have survived. However, Tuol Sleng was only one of at least 150 execution centres in the country.Locard, Henri, State Violence in Democratic Kampuchea (1975-1979) and Retribution (1979-2004), European Review of History, Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2005, pp.121‚Äì143.

All 20 passengers and crew on board as well as 32 people on the ground were killed. Accident St. Paul's Church, Munich On 17 December 1960, the Samaritan was due to fly from Munich-Riem airport in Germany to RAF Northolt in the United Kingdom with 13 passengers and 7 crew. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft lost power to one of its two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engines. Unable to maintain altitude and with bad visibility due to fog, it hit the 318-foot steeple of St. Paul's Church next to the Oktoberfest site (then vacant) in the downtown Ludwigsvorstadt borough. Subsequently, at 2:10 PM, it crashed into a crowded two-section Munich tramway car in Martin-Greif-Stra√üe, close to Bayerstra√üe. All 13 passengers and 7 crew members on the plane died. 32 people on the ground were killed and 20 were injured. A section of the wing crashed through the roof of a building at Hermann-Lingg-Stra√üe, a block away from the main accident site, without injuring anybody there. Time magazine later reported that all 13 passengers on the Convair were holiday-bound University of Maryland students. Aircraft The accident aircraft, Convair C-131D-CO Samaritan, (c/n 212, company designation: Model 340-79), was a twin piston engined military transport with seating for 44 passengers. Given the military serial number 55-0291, the aircraft was the first United States Air Force C-131 to be based in Europe, at RAF Northolt, where it was under command of the 7500th Air Base Group, 3rd Air Force, U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Investigation A crash investigation revealed water in the fuel tank booster pump. Because water is more dense than fuel it can settle to the bottom of the tank, into the pump inlets; when it freezes it blocks inlets and deprives the engine of fuel. This deprivation of fuel caused the Munich C-131 to lose power and eventually shut down the engine. Aftermath After the accident, the Munich Fire & Rescue Services ordered new TLF 16 powder trucks to complement their fleet of traditional water tenders. The day before the accident, two commercial airliners collided over New York, killing 134. The accidents fueled the discussions in Munich and Hamburg for building new airports further away from the cities. Due to resistance of the citizens, the new Munich airport did not commence operation until 32 years later, in 1992. Hamburg still uses Fuhlsb√ºttel Airport, which was founded in 1911 and is the oldest airport operating in Germany.

Headquartered in downtown Riverside, California, it is the primary newspaper for Riverside County, with heavy penetration into neighboring San Bernardino County. The geographic circulation area of the newspaper spans from the border of Orange County, California to the west, east to the Coachella Valley, north to the San Bernardino Mountains, and south to the San Diego County line. The Press- Enterprise is a member of the Southern California News Group. The newspaper traces its roots to The Press, which began publishing in 1878, and The Daily Enterprise, which started publishing in 1885. The two papers were merged into one company in 1931, but the company did not begin publishing a daily morning paper named The Press-Enterprise until 1983. A. H. Belo acquired the company in 1998. In October 2013, A.H. Belo announced that it had reached an agreement to sell The Press-Enterprise's assets to Freedom Communications, parent company of the Orange County Register, for $27 million; after some delays, the transaction closed in late November.Ken Bensinger, \\"Sale of Riverside Press- Enterprise to Aaron Kushner closes, finally\\", Los Angeles Times, November 21, 2013. Freedom declared bankruptcy in 2016, the Register and the Press- Enterprise were sold in a bankruptcy auction to Digital First Media in March 2016. The Press-Enterprise's local competitors are the San Bernardino Sun and the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, along with sharing some of its western circulation areas with the Orange County Register and The Californian (of Temecula) in the southwest area. History The Riverside Press was first published on June 29, 1878 by James Roe, a druggist and teacher.Patterson, Tom. A Colony For California, Second Edition, 1996. Page 55. In 1880 Roe sold the newspaper to Luther M. Holt, who, for several years, published the paper under the name the Riverside Press and Horticulturist. In 1886 Holt began issuing the paper daily.The Press-Enterprise, Press Into The Past, 1878-2007: A Press-Enterprise Timeline, April 20, 2007 The Riverside Daily Enterprise was first published in 1885 by David F. Sarber, and became a county paper in 1896 when it absorbed the Perris Valley Record and the Moreno Valley Indicator. The paper was published somewhat sporadically through 1911 by various owners, and under various names, including; Riverside Weekly Enterprise, Riverside Semi- weekly Enterprise, Weekly Enterprise, and the Morning Mission. In 1912, The Enterprise was sold to the owners of the San Bernardino Sun. In 1931 The Press purchased The Enterprise from the San Bernardino Sun. The newly combined company issued The Enterprise in the morning, and The Press in the evenings. In 1954 the Riverside Press changed its company name to the Press-Enterprise Company, and in 1955 the two papers began printing a joint Sunday edition called the Sunday Press-Enterprise. Due to market conditions, the two papers were combined into one morning paper, The Press-Enterprise, in 1983. The Dallas-based A.H. Belo Corporation purchased The Press-Enterprise Company from the Hays family through multiple acquisitions in 1997 and 1998. Enterprise Media was formed in 2010 and released a B2B website, enterprisemedia.co. In 2013, The Press-Enterprise was sold to Freedom Communications for $27 million. On March 21, 2016, The Press-Enterprise and its sister newspaper The Orange County Register were sold to Digital First Media, after Freedom Communications declared bankruptcy and was placed in an auction which included Tribune Publishing. With Digital First Media as its new owner, it now expands to 11 daily newspapers, six in Los Angeles County, three in San Bernardino County, one in Orange County, and one in Riverside County. Pulitzer Prize The Press-Enterprise won the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for meritorious public service for its expos√© of corruption in the courts in connection with the handling of the property and estates of the Agua Caliente Indian tribe of Palm Springs, California. The series was written by George Ringwald. Supreme Court cases The Press-Enterprise Company won two separate United States Supreme Court cases that established the public's right to witness specific aspects of criminal court proceedings. The first case, won in 1984, was Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California. In a case involving the rape and murder of a teenage girl, the Press-Enterprise requested that the voir dire, the process of questioning the jury, be open to the public and press. The request was denied, as well as the request for the subsequent transcripts, and upheld by the California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme Court denied the Press-Enterprise's request for a hearing. The United States Supreme Court decided in favor of the Press-Enterprise, establishing that the public has the right to attend jury selection during criminal trials.Justia.com; US Supreme Court Center; PRESS-ENTERPRISE CO. V. SUPERIOR CT., 464 U. S. 501 (1984). Retrieved 2009-11-16. The second case, won in 1986, was Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Riverside County, California. The case involved Robert Diaz who was accused of 12 patient murders while acting as a nurse at the Community Hospital of the Valleys in Perris, California. The defendant requested that the public be excluded from the proceedings. The Magistrate granted the unopposed request because of the national attention that the case had garnered. At the end of the hearing the Press-Enterprise requested that the transcripts be released, but the request was denied and the records were sealed. The United States Supreme Court decided that the public has the right to attend pretrial hearings in criminal cases, including preliminary hearings.Justia.com; US Supreme Court Center; PRESS-ENTERPRISE CO.

Latin hierarchy  The whole of the country forms a single archdiocese, the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Suva, which has two (foreign) suffragan sees :http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/country/FJ.htm GCatholic * Diocese of Rarotonga, on the Cook Islands, for those and Niue (both New Zealand- associated countries) * Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru, with see at Tarawa on Kiribati (formerly Gilbert Islands), also for Nauru (republic). They all partake in the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific (C.E. PAC.; which is part of the broader Federation of Catholic Bishops‚Äô Conferences of Oceania, F.C.B.C.O.) ), as neither of these countries' tiny episcopates warrants a national Episcopal Conference. There are not titular, pre-diocesan or other exempt sees. The only defunct jurisdictions are the direct precursors of the Archdiocese of Suva. There is formally an Apostolic Nunciature (papal diplomatic representation, embassy level) to the Fiji Islands but it is vested (as with many South Sea states) in the Apostolic Nunciature in the New Zealand capital, Wellington. History Missions of the Marist Fathers were begun in the Lau Islands in 1844 and then in Levuka but were initially unsuccessful. A more successful mission began in Levuka in 1861. Many churches were built by Bishop Julien Vidal around 1900. Sex abuse scandal On July 13, 2020, New Zealand's 1News revealed that a year long investigation found that the Catholic Church in Fiji had at least 1,300 allegations of sexual abuse against children. 1News Pacific Correspondent Barbara Dreaver, who was in Fiji just before the national lockdown, spoke with some of the victims of the alleged abuse. Many of these allegations also involved Catholic schools in Fiji. Some of the accused clergy were also originally from Australia and New Zealand before they were transferred to Fiji as well. Dr Murray Heasley from the Network of Survivors in Faith Based Institution also stated to 1News that Fiji was common place for the New Zealand Catholic Church to transfer accused Catholic clergy. Despite Archbishop Peter Loy Chong's claim that there had been no reported cases of clergy abusing children in Fiji, Australian priest Julian Fox, who was later convicted and jailed in 2015 for child sex crimes, was transferred to Fiji in 1999 after Australian police started an investigation against him. It was also confirmed that the church also had knowledge of sex abuse allegations against Fox nine years before he was charged. It goes back to the late 1900's when the allegation of sexual abuse took place in New Zealand which the suspects were sent into the Pacific without police clearance at that time  Demographics  There are approximately 80,000 Catholics in Fiji, just under 10% of the total population. The 1996 census revealed just over 75 percent of Catholics to be indigenous Fijians and 5 percent Indo-Fijians, with minority communities making up the balance.

He was the father of comedian Vanessa Hollingshead. He evangelized the use of LSD to many notable figures. Biography Hollingshead was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange in 1961.Best Sellers (1987) by Helen Dwight Reid Educational Foundation, University of Scranton. Dr. John Beresford, a research scientist, received a package of one gram of LSD from Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland at a time when it was still legal to experiment with it. Beresford, in turn, gave part of the gram to Hollingshead. One of Hollingshead's experiments studied the effects on web-weaving by spiders under the influence of the drug. Hollingshead claims to have first tried LSD by licking the spoon of a batch of LSD-laced cake icing he had packed in a mayonnaise jar for transport. (This jar was to become the object of psychedelic legend.) Following this first experience, Hollingshead contacted Aldous Huxley, who suggested he get in contact with Timothy Leary to discuss the potential of the drug. In September 1961, Hollngshead met Leary in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was invited to live in the latter's house and teach a course at Harvard. Shortly thereafter, he introduced Leary to LSD. Hollingshead participated in the Concord Prison Experiment with Leary, Ralph Metzner, and others in 1962. For the next few years he worked with psychedelic therapists, and lived at Millbrook, New York with Leary and Richard Alpert (a.k.a. Ram Dass). He then set up a New York- based project of his own together with Jean Houston, where guided trips were performed and data gathered which, according to Hollingshead's book, formed the core material for Masters' and Houston's work The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience. In 1965, he moved to London and opened the World Psychedelic Center. He also worked in experimental film, collaborating on the Scott Bartlett short subject \\"A Trip to the Moon\\", in 1968. 'Seven young men, each of them involved in one of the arts (Carlo Ceniveros, Gene Schoefeld, Micheal Hollingstead, Jin Arender, Scott Barlett, Edward Bear, Iver Flom) talk for the greater part of the film. They are involved in a discussion of mystical processes important to them: astrology and the I Ching.' Hollingshead was an associate of the Castalia Foundation, a contributor to the Psychedelic Review, and interviewed cult writer Robert Anton Wilson for High Times magazine in 1980. According to Psychedelia Britannica, Hollingswood died in the early 1980s. In a 2018 interview, Hollingshead's daughter Vanessa said that her father died in Bolivia from a stomach ulcer in 1984.  Influence Apart from Leary, those Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD include writers William S. Burroughs and Paul Krassner, comparative religions scholar Huston Smith, philosopher Alan Watts, graphic designer Storm Thorgerson, film director Roman Polanski, poet Allen Ginsberg, businessman-financier Saul Steinberg, musicians Donovan, Keith Richards, Pete LaRoca, Charles Mingus, Maynard Ferguson and Paul McCartney, John Lennon, and George Harrison of the Beatles.

Although the archives functions primarily as the government archive, it also preserves some documents from private individuals and non-public organizations. The mission of the archives is to collect and preserve records for future generations.  Organization  The National Archives of Sweden is a state administrative authority, organized under the Ministry of Culture. The head of The National Archives, known as the Riksarkivarie in Swedish, works alongside of staff responsible for strategic issues, and overall coordination and development. The position is currently held by Karin √Östr√∂m Iko. The structure of the organization is divided into five departments: the Regional Department, National Department, Department of Conservation and Digital Infrastructure, Department of Public Information Management, and Administrative Department. The Regional Department includes Regional Archives (Landsarkiven) located in seven cities: Gothenburg, H√§rn√∂sand, Lund, Uppsala, Vadsterna, Visby, and √ñstersund. The National Department includes the main branch Marieburg in Stockholm, Arninge located just north of Stockholm, and other archives that have been incorporated into the National Archives, including the Military Archives and the Heraldry Board. History The National Archives of Sweden is one of the oldest public authorities in Sweden, with roots that can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Beginning under King Gustav Vasa, an archive was created from previously collected older documents, some documents that were received, and documents drawn up in the Royal Office. On October 18, 1618 Axel Oxenstierna, the Lord High Chancellor (Rikskansler) of the Privy Council, issued a Chancellor's Order to appoint a special secretary, along with two writers, to be responsible for the archive, thus creating the National Archives as an institution. Over time, the archive became less important for the activities of the Chancellor, and more valuable for historical researchers. However, it wasn't until 1878 that the National Archives was established as an independent authority. In 1697 a fire at the Tre Kronor castle in Stockholm destroyed a large portion of the Archives, resulting in a severe loss of items and documents from the Middle Ages. Out of 24,500 books and 1,400 manuscripts, only 6,000 books and 400 manuscripts could be salvaged, respectively. One of Sweden's most famous books, The Silver Bible (Silverbibeln), or Codex Argenteus, was purportedly thrown out the castle window to save it from the flames. The National Archives was originally limited to the Royal Office, but over time the National Archives has subsumed responsibility for archives of other central and local authorities. Regional Archives In order to preserve documents from regional and local governments, regional archives were created in seven cities from 1899 to 1935. The Archives of Vadstena was the first regional archive to open in 1899. Regional archives in Lund and Uppsala both opened in 1903, Visby in 1905, Gothenburg in 1911, √ñstersund in 1928, and finally in H√§rn√∂sand in 1935. The Regional Archives (Landsarkiven) were merged with the National Archives (Riksarkivet) in 2010 under a joint authority.  Military Archives  The Military Archives (Swedish: Krigsarkivet) were created in 1805. Formerly an independent authority, The Military Archives were incorporated into the National Archives in 1995. The archive stores a unique and comprehensive collections of maps, including historical maps of Sweden, hand-written foreign topographical maps, and city fortification plans. The National Herald Board The National Herald Board was closed in 1953, and the state's heraldic operations continued as a department under the National Archives. The department deals with questions about coat of arms design, flags and emblems and continuously produces new heraldic images for newly formed governmental bodies, counties, etc. The head of the National Herald Board held the title of National Herald, but in the new organization the title instead became State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In 2007, the Swedish military altered the image of the heraldic lion depicted on the Nordic Battlegroup's coat of arms, removing the lion's penis to promote a more gender neutral image following protests from female soldiers. The creator of the image at the National Archives, Vladimir A. Sagerlund, made the news in Sweden over his staunch disapproval of the change. Holdings The oldest document in the National Archives (listed in 2005) is a parchment from a missal, written in England in the late 10th century. The document came to Sweden via the British Christian missionary in Norway. Under King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, archiving expanded and national registry and chamber books, land records, and diplomatic treaties were collected in the National Archives. Scrolls in Cyrillic writing from Novgorod were preserved in memory of the Swedish occupation from 1611 to 1617. There is a wide variety of materials available, including documents from the ministry, parliament, and central authorities. Documentation of government decisions from the 1840s to 1980s are available to researchers. Around 100,000 maps and drawings of state civilian buildings from 1697 to 1993 are preserved in the archive. Although the primary focus of the National Archives is government records, there are also some personal archives, which were in the past obtained via confiscations and seizures, and more recently as donations. Personal collections include feudal archives from the 17th and 18th century, such as the Skokloster collection, Sj√∂holms, Stafsund and Ericsberg archives, and other archives of statesmen and cultural personalities. There are also some archives of non-governmental associations and businesses, as well as news archives. In 2015 the archival holdings amounted to approximately 750 kilometers of shelving - comprising mainly parchment and paper. The digital media holdings included 130 million digital images. The amount of documents increases continuously because of the delivery of documents from the Cabinet Office and other central agencies. Novgorod Occupation Archives The \\"Novgorod occupation archives\\" (Swedish: Ockupationsarkivet fr√•n Novgorod) is the name used since the 1960s for a unique collection of documents in the National Archives. They are written in Russian by Russian administrators of the city of Veliky Novgorod during the years 1611-1617 when the Swedish army occupied the city. The documents include both originals and copies that were intended to be sent to Moscow. When the Swedish army withdrew from the city, the commander Jacob De la Gardie collected these documents as useful evidence for the peace negotiations and brought them back to his quarters in Estonia. Later the collection was sent to Stockholm, where its importance as a source of Russian history was recognized in the mid-19th century. They were first catalogued in 1964 by Russian historian Sergei Dmitrievsky. An improved catalogue was printed and published in 2005.Elisabeth L√∂fstrand, Laila Nordquist, Accounts of an Occupied City : Catalogue of the Novgorod Occupation Archives, Series I, Skrifter utgivna av Riksarkivet 24 (2005), series II, Skrifter utgivna av Riksarkivet 31 (2009). The documents (which comprise 30,000 pages) were initially microfilmed, and the monochrome microfilm later digitized. This digital archive is available online. The collection consists of two series. Series 1 has 141 books and series 2 has 368 scrolls.Ockupationsarkivet fr√•n Novgorod, website of the National Archives, in Swedish, visited October 19, 2014.Ockupationsarkivet fr√•n Novgorod , website of Stockholm University, department of history, in Swedish, visited October 19, 2014.  Digital Collections and Access  The National Archives is subject to open government, which means that the holdings in general are available to the public - including researchers and research- related individuals. The exception is made for confidential documents or certain perishable older material. Many of the oldest documents are, however, reproduced on microfilm or as digital images. In 2017, the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag) awarded the Swedish National Archives 10 million SEK in order to make its digital collections available to the public free of charge. The subscription charge for the digital collections was removed on February 1, 2018 and the Archives has announced further plans to move towards open and free access. There are currently 180 million pages digitized, of which 65.5 million are accessible through the digital reading room (SVAR). The National Archives is also responsible for the development and administration of Sweden's national portal for open data and public sector information, and future plans will focus on making the digital collections accessible as open, linkable, and machine-readable data that will be integrated into the open data from the public sector.  Newspapers  In 2018, the research foundation Acadia donation 30 million SEK to digitize all of the copyright-free Swedish newspapers preserved by the Royal Library (KB), estimated at 1,250 titles. Newspapers older than 115 years are free from copyright and when the project is expected to complete in 2022, the digitized newspapers will extend up to the year 1906. The Royal Library and the National Archives have collaborated on digitization since 2010, and the digitization will take place at the National Archives Unit for Digitalization Media Conversion Center (MKC).  Regulations  The National Archives regulations RA-FS and RA-MS are legal rules for government agencies and other groups that store public records from government archives. The regulations dictate how the documents should be created, organized, reported, deleted, stored, and submitted to the repository.

Gambia is a predominantly Muslim country (approximately 94% of the population). The Diocese of Banjul covers the whole of the country. Relations between the Muslim and Christian communities in Gambia are generally very good. The Catholic Church operates various missions including schools which children of Muslim parents attend. Of the minority Christian population, there are around 30,000 Catholics, which represents around 2% of the population. History The history of the Catholic Church in the Gambia is closely linked to Senegal. In 1445 Portuguese arrived on the coast of West Africa with the first attempts of Evangelism. From the ecclesiastical point of view, only in 1931 was born the mission of the Gambia, entrusted to the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, detached from the Apostolic vicariate of Senegambia. In 1951 was erected the Apostolic Prefecture of Bathurst (now Banjul), which became a diocese in 1957 immediately subject to Holy See. In 1992 Pope John Paul II visited Gambia and gave further impetus to the interest in Christian-Muslim relations within the Catholic community. The Pope stressed the importance of the good relations existing between the two. He stated ‚Äúwe are all pilgrims on the path of seeking to do God‚Äôs will in everything. Although we differ in many ways, there are important elements of our respective faiths which can serve as a basis for fruitful dialogue and a strengthening of the spirit of tolerance and mutual help‚Äù. He met with leaders of the Muslim community, and Muslims were present at the Mass he celebrated at the Independence Stadium while in the Gambia. Organization and institutions In 2008 the Catholic Church is present in the territory with the sole Diocese of Banjul, immediately subject to the Holy See. At the end of 2004 the Catholic Church of The Gambia counted: * 56 parishes * 26 priests * 42 religious sisters * 57 schools * 9 charities. The Catholic population amounted to 34,400 Christians, equal to 2.10% of the population.

Mooca today is home to over 75,000 inhabitants, spread in its . It is also considered one of the fastest growing districts in the city, experiencing over the last years a vigorous momentum in the construction industry. Mooca has been the stage for many social movements, specially because of the presence of a strong influence of the industry interests in the political scene of S√£o Paulo towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The composition of Mooca's economy today ranges from small businesses ran by locals, large industries, such as Lorenzetti and Groupe SEB, both important players locally and globally in the home appliances industry, and ultimately, large shopping malls offering a variety of services. History The plains where Mooca lies were first settled by ancient Native American communities, such as the Tupi- Guaran√≠. S√£o Paulo, known in the 16th century as S√£o Paulo de Piratininga, arose from a Jesuit mission, founded in 1554 to convert indigenous populations, and its history is often confused with that of Mooca. In 1567, Portuguese Bandeirantes, or pathfinders, based in the village of S√£o Paulo de Piratininga moved eastwards in their expeditions and that was probably when the region was first explored. Over the centuries, Mooca became an important rural area, containing a number of farms and cottages, dependent on the work of enslaved African-Brazilians. In the 1890s the area was divided into large plots that were put on sale in order to encourage Mooca's development. The district eventually became an important industrial area as the farms gave way to factories and industries towards the beginning of the 20th century. One of the first working-class sections is Vila Maria Z√©lia in the northern district of Bel√©m. Many of the industrial installations eventually moved out of the city or closed down (even though a number of them are still active) and, much of the industrial zones became residential. Italian settlement Cotonif√≠cio Crespi textile industry, sold to Extra Hipermercados supermarket chain. In early 1900s, many industries settled in Mooca's quiet plains, an isolated area back then. Because labour at that time was in high demand, many immigrants from Italy, most of them coming from the city of Naples, fled to S√£o Paulo to take up jobs at local industries. Indeed, much of Mooca's development was an outcome of the strong Italian immigrant influence. In 1910, two out of three inhabitants of Mooca were Italian. The largest and most important collection on the history of immigration in Brazil, and specially the large flow of Italian and immigrants arriving in S√£o Paulo state via the port of Santos, can be found at Museu da Imigra√ß√£o, a state-run museum that offers a very interesting database on immigrant records.Am√°cio Mazzaropi museum, named after a famous Brazilian comedian born to an Italian father, is a site of interest that preserves some of Mooca's immigration golden age memories. Another site of interest that is strongly related to Mooca's Italian origins is the local soccer team stadium, Juventus Stadium (cap. 2.000). A great number of the working-class families from Mooca found prosperity and as S√£o Paulo was gradually changing from an industrial city into a business centre, many of those families started their own businesses (such as the Lorenzetti and Matarazzo families). Many of the more affluent families now reside in Tatuap√©. The local Italian community holds traditional religious celebrations and festivities all year round, being the most famous that of San Vito, Our Lady of Casaluce, San Gennaro (patron saint of Naples) and Our Lady Achiropita in the district of Bela Vista. These celebrations take place on the streets, where, aside from the true markets offering typical dishes, handicrafts and wine, stages for dance presentations and live traditional music are set up. Cultural influences A large number of Mooca's inhabitants have an Italian background although over the last century, Mooca embraced other communities from other parts of the world and regions in Brazil. Some representative communities that have contributed to Mooca's ethnic diversity are the Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Croatian, Lithuanian, Syrian, Lebanese and more recently the Bolivian and Peruvian, besides Brazilians migrants from the Northeast. Urban development  High rises, Alto da Mooca Residential area, Mooca Hip√≥dromo Mooca's atmosphere has always been that of an industrial suburb. Buildings, homes and warehouses fa√ßades preserve traces of the Italian legacy and it is not unusual to find old preserved vilas oper√°rias, narrow cobbled residential streets in large abandoned industries surroundings, where the Italians and other workers from different countries first settled. However, this scenery has changed as in the last decades industries have been moving out of S√£o Paulo for it has become increasingly expensive. As a result of this phenomenon, many warehouses and industries facilities were simply abandoned, creating perfect conditions for real estate speculation to turn Mooca into one of the fastest growing districts in Brazil's largest city, consolidating its momentum as a powerhouse in East S√£o Paulo. Real estate speculation not only is taking place in residential areas, but also in major business areas all over the district. Office towers have been built recently, mainly along Avenida Paes de Barros. BRMalls, a Brazilian shopping centre & real state management corporation, has opened in November, 2011 a state-of-the-art shopping mall in the area, the Mooca Plaza Shopping spanning , and containing over 200 high-end stores. Due to Mooca's industrial nature, there is a lack of green spaces in the district. The local government holds a tree plantation program through which residents may have trees planted in their sidewalks at no cost. It is quite evident, when visiting some parts of Mooca, that there is a need for green areas and locals have long called for it. Over the past years, the attempts of the government to increase the amount of green spaces in Mooca, along with the launch of residential condominiums projects that adopt a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù concept have indeed changed much of Mooca's gray landscape. Mooca is split into four sections (known as bairros), although these are often confused as they are very integrated and locals refer to them simply as Mooca: ‚Ä¢ Mooca: central area ‚Ä¢ Hip√≥dromo: northwest, along the railway and Avenida Alc√¢ntara Machado, known as Radial Leste ‚Ä¢ Parque da Mooca: south, along Avenida Paes de Barros ‚Ä¢ Alto da Mooca: northeast, along Rua Siqueira Bueno extending to Rua da Mooca Transportation Buses Mooca is served by several bus and trolleybus lines that connect it to the city centre, neighbouring districts (such as Tatuap√©, Bel√©m, Br√°s and √Ågua Rasa) and also other cities within Greater S√£o Paulo area (e.g. S√£o Caetano do Sul). Some of the most important avenues, such as Avenida Paes de Barros, offer express lanes designed for buses only. Subway S√£o Paulo metro system plays an important role in Mooca's transport network as it services the district and its surroundings with at least 4 (four) subway stations, named Br√°s, Bresser-Mooca, Bel√©m (on Line 3-Red) and Vila Prudente (on Line 2-Green). The short surface segment of the Line 3-Red of the city's subway system was first built in the 1970s along Avenida Alc√¢ntara Machado (Radial Leste), an eight-lane highway which is one of the main gateways to eastern parts of S√£o Paulo. Suburban trains A western part of Mooca which lies along the border with Br√°s district, is serviced by CPTM's (Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos) (English: Metropolitan Trains of S√£o Paulo) Line 10-Turquoise from Mooca station and by Line 11-Coral from Br√°s station, connecting with subway Line 3-Red. Education Anhembi Morumbi University Memorial do Imigrante Museum Anhembi Morumbi theatre The three universities, fifteen public schools (which include infant schools, primary schools, high schools and technical high schools), along with a number of private institutions offer a wide range of education options for students in Mooca. Some public schools are funded by the state of S√£o Paulo while others are funded by the municipality of S√£o Paulo. Additionally, the district offers three theatres, a public library (Biblioteca Affonso Taunay), and the state-ran museum Museu da Imigra√ß√£o.

There are several church-run private institutions, following Mooca's strong catholic traditions. Some of the most important independent schools, including those ran by the Catholic Church, are: Col√©gio S√£o Judas Tadeu Col√©gio Santa Catarina Col√©gio Ouro Preto Col√©gio Santa Am√©lia Col√©gio Passo Seguro Col√©gio S√£o Paulo (Anglo) Instituto Pedag√≥gico Maria Montessori Instituto de Educa√ß√£o Cruz de Malta Externato Nossa Senhora Menina Externato S√£o Rafael Liceu Santa Cruz S√£o Judas Tadeu University Universities Few districts in S√£o Paulo contain as many higher education institutions as Mooca. Although there are no public universities, Mooca takes pride in its three private universities campuses: Universidade S√£o Judas Tadeu Universidade Anhembi Morumbi Centro Universit√°rio Capital Sport Juventus athletics club Juventus stadium (cap.2000) If Mooca lacks green spaces in one hand, it offers sport venues and nature in the 196.000sqm of its sports club, Clube da Mooca, and at the local athletics club, Clube Atl√©tico Juventus, which has a namesake soccer team and a small stadium (Est√°dio Conde Rodolfo Crespi), as mentioned above. Juventus soccer team was formed in 1924 under the name of Cotonif√≠cio Rodolfo Crespi F.C. and consisted of players who worked at Cotonif√≠cio Crespi textile industry (see photo above). One year later, a piece of land at Rua Javari next to the plant facilities was donated to the community by Crespi, owner of the textile industry, so that there would be a property for the construction of venue for the community and for the recently formed team to play. Cotonif√≠cio Rodolfo Crespi F.C switched its name in 1930, a year after it won S√£o Paulo state league. The name Clube Atl√©tico Juventus was suggested by Crespi. Est√°dio Conde Rodolfo Crespi hosted in 1959 a match between Juventus and Santos F.C., in which Pel√© scored the most beautiful goal in his career. SESC Belenzinho - is a cultural centre and sports venue and, although it is located just outside the district, it is site of interest in the area as provides Mooca's population with a variety of quality theatre plays, busy cultural agenda and sports training (e.g. tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, yoga, pilates, etc.) Cuisine and nightlife Bar Mooca Perhaps the highest index of pizza restaurants per inhabitant in S√£o Paulo, and in the entire Latin America, is Mooca. It has at least over 100 pizza restaurants and a large number of Italian restaurants. Mooca is a top destination for people from other parts of the city who are looking for fine Italian food. Some of the most famous pizza places in Mooca include: Pizzeria S√£o Pedro, Pizzeria do Angelo, Babbo Giovanni, Zio Pasquale, Bendita Maria, Emporio 167. Also, some of the local bars are famous in S√£o Paulo particularly El√≠dio Bar, a soccer- themed bar, Moocaires, an Argentine bistro-bar, Vilarejo S√£o Paulo, a square that concentrates a number of restaurants and bars, with a particular European-like architecture and Bar Mooca. Moreover, Mooca has now other great restaurants and bars that worth the visit, such as Bravo Bistro, Bricabraque, Deck, and some others.

He was a seaman, trader, poet, farmer and boat builder who tried to develop direct trade between the Faroes and the rest of Europe and introduced vaccination to the islands. He went missing in the winter of 1808/09 sailing home from England. Life Poul Poulsen was born in N√≥lsoy, the fourth of seven children. He and his brothers all took the additional name 'Nols√∏e' for the island where they were born.John Frederick West, Faroe: The Emergence of a Nation, London: Hurst, 1972, , p. 49. After his father's death in 1786 he fulfilled his ambition of going to sea, and travelled widely; he supposedly served in both the British and the French Navy, captained a US merchant vessel,West, p. 50. and also sailed on pirate ships in China.Ernst Krenn, Die Entwicklung der Foeroyischen Literatur, Illinois Studies in Languages and Literature vol. 26, no. 1, Urbana: University of Illinois, 1940, , p. 74 In 1798 he married a woman from his home island, Sigga Maria Tummasd√≥ttir, and was based in Copenhagen for a couple of years, then returned to the Faroes in 1800. His wife died, and in 1801 he remarried to Maren or Marin Malene Ziska, the daughter of a wealthy crown tenant near Klaksv√≠k on Bor√∞oy, and took over another crown tenancy nearby.Jak. Jakobsen, \\"Nols√∏e, Poul Poulsen\\", Dansk biografisk leksikon, online at Projekt Runeberg, pp. 308-09, p. 308.Krenn, p. 75. He was so successful farming there that the Danish Royal Society for the Advancement of Agriculture awarded him a silver medal, although he died before he could receive it.Jakobsen, p. 309. His innovations in shipbuilding, a longer and more sharply rising keel and a less square sail closer to the lateen, were rapidly adopted. He also designed an improved spinning wheel.West, p. 51. Denied a loan to buy a ship to demonstrate the possibilities of fishing from larger ships, he, his brother- in-law Per Larsen, Jacob Jacobsen and Poul's brothers bought a wrecked ship at auction and rebuilt her at V√°gur. Launched on 6 August 1804 and christened Royndin Fr√≠√∞a (Beautiful Trial), this schooner was the first seagoing ship built in the Faroe Islands, and the first Faroese-owned vessel since the early Middle Ages.West, p. 55. Since 1805 was a bad year for fishing, he instead took loads of coal from Su√∞uroy across the Atlantic to Bergen and Copenhagen, trying to open up direct trading, but was prevented from importing goods to the Faroes by the Danish Royal Trade Monopoly authorities.Jonathan Wylie, The Faroe Islands: Interpretations of History, Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 1987, , p. 216, note 11. Instead, by vaccinating members of his crew successively using material from the previous man, he succeeded in bringing the first smallpox vaccine back to the Faroes, and with the help of one of his brothers spread vaccination through the islands.West, p. 56. The following year, after again attempting to trade directly, he was convicted and fined on two charges of contravention of the trading laws, but cleared of smuggling goods back to the Faroes, having sold them to a Swedish ship in the Kattegat.West, pp. 56-57. He reacted by counter-suing the T√≥rshavn district sheriff, Joen Christiansen √òre, for large-scale smuggling; the Monopoly officials appear to have been conducting personal trading on the side. However, he seems to have dropped the lawsuit.West, p. 58. In 1807, after a year's effort to overcome refusals by the local government in the Faroes and by the Monopoly, he sailed to Copenhagen on Royndin Fr√≠√∞a as one of a deputation of five presenting a popularly supported proposal for a three-year experimental lifting of the trade restrictions. They had to illegally sell 2,600 knitted sweaters and other merchandise to a Norwegian merchant to finance the voyage,West, pp. 59-60. but Crown Prince Frederick, who was governing as regent for his father, and others in Copenhagen were sympathetic, and trade would have been opened up if war with England had not begun.West, p. 60. After the battle in 1807, the British Navy began a six-year blockade of Denmark as part of the ongoing Napoleonic wars, cutting off the Monopoly barley trade which had supplied 80% of the Faroes Islanders' grain needs. To stave off famine, N√≥lsoyar P√°ll obtained a pass from the British, and brought a load of barley back with him in October 1807.West, p. 61. The following summer, after two British ships in succession had plundered the Faroes of all Danish government property, he sailed back to Denmark at the request of the T√≥rshavn commandant to try to obtain more grain, but Royndin Fr√≠√∞a was seized by a British warship and irreparably damaged. Taken to London, he and his crew obtained the Privy Council's sympathy and a replacement ship, the North Star; in this ship they sailed soon after 17 November 1808 with what was to have been the first of several grain shipments, but were lost at sea, presumably in the heavy storms of November and December that year, near Sumba.West, pp. 66-67.Wylie, p. 213, note 3. The famine was not averted until 1810, when an arrangement was made with the British.Wylie, p. 67. The depth of the hatred between N√≥lsoyar P√°ll and the T√≥rshavn commandant is demonstrated by the latter expressing his satisfaction the next April at P√°ll's having not returned, even though he had asked him to sail for help.West, pp. 66 This led to suspicion, which still persists, that the commandant had arranged P√°ll's death, perhaps by commissioning a Norwegian privateer (the Odin) to sink P√°ll's ship south of the Faroes.West, 67.  Poetry  N√≥lsoyar P√°ll was a talented poet known for satirical ballads. He and his youngest brother J√°kup often collaborated on poems;Krenn, p. 73. \\"Fuglakv√¶√∞i\\" was released earlier than he would have liked; someone heard him and his brother working on it. Krenn, p. 79. the first mature work which can be unequivocally ascribed to P√°ll is \\"Kr√°kuteiti,\\" about the case of a law-man who refused to recognise the baby he had fathered on his housekeeper: he is portrayed as a heron, the housekeeper as a duck, the judge he tried to buy, a cuckoo, and the unwanted child, a red knot. \\"J√°kup √° M√∏n\\" is about an unlucky suitor, and mocks the parochialism then very prevalent in the islands.Krenn, pp. 75-76. \\"Fruntat√°ttur\\" mocks the fashion for women to wear a fringe.Krenn, p. 77. \\"Gorplandskv√¶√∞i\\" memorialises the cowardice of the commandant of the T√≥rshavn garrison, who surrendered without a fight to a British gunboat.West, pp. 61-62. A rather rushed work, it has been claimed for another poet, but the tone of the mockery and characteristics such as N√≥lsoy vocabulary indicate it is by N√≥lsoyar P√°ll.Krenn, p. 79. His best known work is \\"Fuglakv√¶√∞i\\" (Ballad of the Birds), a 229-stanza work in which birds of prey symbolise the Danish authorities, and the poet himself warns the smaller birds in the guise of an oystercatcher, which was later chosen to be the national bird of the Faroe Islands. The ballad said in poetic form what could not have been said in plain speech; it sold many copies.Krenn, pp. 78, 79.West, pp. 58-59. Memorial at Fl√∏tan Fr√≠√∞a in V√°gur to building of Royndin Fr√≠√∞a there by N√≥lsoyar P√°ll and others Influence N√≥lsoyar P√°ll almost succeeded in opening the Faroes to direct trading over half a century early, although most of his inspiration was posthumous.In Wylie's judgement, \\"N√≥lsoyar P√°ll, for all his heroism and undoubted genius, gained more posthumously and symbolically than in fact and in his own time.\\" (p. 87). His ideas, Royndin Fr√≠√∞a and the training he provided to Faroese in ocean-going sailing began the development of deep-sea fishing, which later brought the islands prosperity; Klaksv√≠k, where he lived and hauled up for the winter, has become one of the fishing ports.West, p. 67. He was an exemplary patriot and has become a national hero. In his poem \\"Heimfer√∞ N√≥lsoyar P√°ls\\" (The Return of N√≥lsoyar P√°ll), Janus Djurhuus wrote of his voyage home, drawn by Beinisv√∏r√∞, symbolising the independent islands.Heimfer√∞ N√≥lsoyar P√°ls at Faroeartstamps, FaroePost, with translation by Anker Eli Petersen, 21 November 2005, retrieved 25 September 2011.Beinisv√∏r√∞ at Faroestamps.fo, 6 October 2006, retrieved 25 September 2011.

In his debut, on September 30, he pitched a complete game, 4‚Äì2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies and their staff ace Grover Cleveland Alexander, foiling Alexander's bid for his 20th victory of the season. After that, Bader played for the Buffalo minor league team, and went 16-7 In 1914, 20-18 in 1915, and in 1916 topped the league pitchers with a 23-8 mark. Bader returned to the major leagues with the Boston Red Sox in 1917. He ended 2-0 with a 2.37 ERA in 15 games, all but one in relief. He enlisted in the Navy at the end of the season, but was discharged in June 1918 because of loose knee ligaments. He rejoined the Red Sox for the rest of the year and played his last game on July 18. Following his majors career, Bader pitched with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League in 1920 and 1923 and was a pitcher-manager with the Lynn, Massachusetts team of the New England League in 1926. He also worked as a Boston Braves scout in 1927, and managed the Hartford, Connecticut club in the Eastern League in 1930. Personal Bader died in LeRoy, Kansas, at the age of 85. Nicknamed \\"King\\", Bader was also known as \\"Two Pairs\\" because he loved playing cards.

Argyrol is synonymous with the chemical Mild Silver Protein (MSP). It was manufactured in the chemical industry at a pharmaceutical grade, using denatured pharmaceutical-grade protein‚Äîfor ophthalmic application‚Äîand elemental silver. This combination produces the silver protein molecule. Widely publicized for its value to resolve gonorrhea infections, it prevents gonorrheal blindness and other pathogenic infections in the eyes of newborn infants. Albert C. Barnes developed and commercialised Argyrol as a prevention technology for use on mucous membranes to resolve localized infections. History Argyrol was first made commercially available in 1901 by the Barnes and Hille Chemists Company. It has remained a registered trademark since Barnes's USPTO registration was first issued in 1902. In 1903, Medical News reported that Barnes had read a paper at the Tri-State Medical Society, in which he said Argyrol could be used to treat conjunctivitis, ophthalmia neonatorum, gonorrheal ophthalmia, otitis media, genitourinary infections and inflammations, and urethritis. In April 1907, Barnes bought out Hille and organized the A.C. Barnes Company to continue the manufacture and global sales of Argyrol from three headquarters located in the United States, Great Britain, and Australia. Argyrol was never patented because Barnes planned to promote it exclusively through his trademark of Argyrol, as the colloidal silver protein for antiseptic use to mucous membranes. The original company was a partnership of Dr Albert C. Barnes, a physician, and Dr. Herman Hille, a chemist, who developed the process of manufacturing it at the urging of Barnes. By World War II, Argyrol post-exposure male hygiene was mandatory in the U.S. and Allied Military VD Prevention Technology for sexual hygiene. With the advent of antibiotics, prevention was out distanced by the promise of cure by simple injection. After that, Argyrol Anti-Infective was prescribed less often because Argyrol‚Äôs 10% Stabilized Solution was available without a prescription, while compounded solutions of mild silver protein, at any requested strength, were available by prescription. Argyrol was an important treatment for ophthalmic infections, and, at least until 1943, was preferred over silver nitrate for treating infections at other sites as well. Used for a range of conditions in human and veterinary medicine, the drug brought in enormous profits. With the money, Barnes accumulated a large collection of art, mainly French Impressionist works, which today form the holdings of the Barnes Foundation, an educational art institution established by his will. The paintings were valued in March 2010 at $25 billion.\\"The Art of Stealing from the Rich and Dead\\". Vanity Fair. March 2, 2010. Retrieved March 12, 2010. Argyrol was manufactured by A.C. Barnes Company until the Zonite Products Corporation acquired the firm in 1929. Argyrol products were compounded by pharmacists at various concentrations and dispensed to the public in pharmacy- labelled bottles. It was also sold in A.C. Barnes Company packaging in solutions of various strengths. A succession of pharmaceutical entities acquired Argyrol over the decades, avidly protecting their right to use the trademark Argyrol as reflected in the public record at the USPTO. The trademark was guarded by Barnes to ensure the quality and protect the reputation of the drug that resulted in a particular protection under law in jurisprudence, as well as to enable the Zonite Products Corporation rightfully to caution their Argyrol buyers to beware of purchasing imitations of Argyrol which contained substances illegally substituted by druggists for competitive compounds that resembled Argyrol.Broad Street Gossip, The Wall Street Journal, August 17, 1929, p. 2. The silver protein molecule in Argyrol has been in use for over 100 years to date, with ample clinical data supporting the benefits and versatility of the silver protein molecule in medicine without the detriment of drug resistance. Although Argyrol is used as a synonym for the chemical descriptions silver vitelline and mild silver protein, Barnes insisted Argyrol was different. A silver-gelatin colloid, made by the reaction of silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide, and gelatin, in which a complex colloidal aggregate is formed, Barnes could rightfully assert Argyrol differed in its chemical assay, for instance, as it was claimed to contain over 30% silver. When compounded in varying strengths, nevertheless, Argyrol is silver protein identified as to its molecular construct. Argyrol is an over-the-counter internationally recognized anti-infection drug, regulatory-compliant immediate to manufacture and distribution in every jurisdiction for antiseptic use in medicine specifically due to global drug regulatory administrative adjudication initiated by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States to mandate New Drug Applications for silver drugs. Argyrol has been used continuously in commercial medicine since the date of Argyrol inception by Barnes and Hille.

The series was in continuous publication in the Aberdeen Press & Journal from September 1961 until its last appearance in 2012. With over 10,000 strips made over the decades and running for over 51 years. Bristow is one of the longest running daily cartoon strips by a single author, according to Guinness World Records. When looking at the character Bristow itself the series is even one year older than that, as Bristow debuted in Dickens' older series Oddbod in The Sunday Times in 1960. Due to his popularity he received his own spin-off series soon afterwards. Dickens broke the original record held by Marc Sleen, whose The Adventures of Nero was drawn for 45 years without any assistance. However, even Dickens' record has been broken in his turn by Jim Russell, whose series The Potts ran for 62 years. Background The cartoons follow the daily life of a buying clerk who works in the monolithic Chester-Perry building. He is a fantasist and has delusions of grandeur, wishing he were a brain surgeon and a writer. His epic tome Living Death in the Buying Department has yet to find a publisher, but he is not discouraged. He lives in a small bedsit in East Winchley and commutes to work by train, invariably arriving late. Bristow is surrounded by co-workers, Fudge (his overbearing manager), Jones, Hewitt, Dimkins, hapless typist Miss Sunman, master chef Gordon Blue, the Postboy and the ever-gossiping Mrs. Purdy the Tealady. Bristow has a crush on routine visitor Miss Pretty of \\"Kleenaphone\\". Another regular visitor is the pigeon who sits on a window ledge. During the winter, the bird travels to a warmer climate where she visits Bristow's counterpart, a black man in a white suit. Bristow invariably holidays at a beach resort known as Funboys Sur La Plage. Frank Dickens is often credited for \\"inventing\\" a cartoon device whereby he wrote the words of the action next to the character, such as \\"flinch flinch\\", as he was unable to draw expressions well enough to fit in the comic-strip boxes. Syndication The strip was widely syndicated in Great Britain and in Australia. It appeared in the Birmingham Evening Mail and, between 1962 and 2001, appeared in the London Evening Standard newspaper. The Melbourne Age and Sydney Morning Herald published the strip from the late 1960s. Since 1966 at least eleven Bristow books have been published in the UK, as well as editions in Australia. A number of collections were published in Italy with the captions translated. Radio adaptation \\"Bristow\\" was made into a BBC Radio 4 series written by Dickens and starring both Michael Williams as Bristow and Rodney Bewes as his colleague Jones. There were 14 half-hour episodes made from April 1999 to July 2000, with frequent repeats on BBC 7. (Radio 4 Extra). Stage adaptation In 1971 the strip was also adapted into a theatrical play.

The Cold War (1962‚Äì1979) refers to the phase within the Cold War that spanned the period between the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis in late October 1962, through the d√©tente period beginning in 1969, to the end of d√©tente in the late 1970s. The United States maintained its Cold War engagement with the Soviet Union during the period, despite internal preoccupations with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1968, Eastern Bloc member Czechoslovakia attempted the reforms of the Prague Spring and was subsequently invaded by the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact members, who reinstated the Soviet model. By 1973, the US had withdrawn from the Vietnam War. While communists gained power in some South East Asian countries, they were divided by the Sino-Soviet Split, with China moving closer to the Western camp, following US President Richard Nixon's visit to China. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Third World was increasingly divided between governments backed by the Soviets (such as Libya , Iraq , Syria , Egypt and South Yemen.) governments backed by NATO (such as Saudi Arabia), and a growing camp of non-aligned nations. The Soviet and other Eastern Bloc economies continued to stagnate. Worldwide inflation occurred following the 1973 oil crisis. Third World and non-alignment in the 1960s and 1970s Decolonization Cold War politics were radically affected by decolonization in Africa, Asia, and to a limited extent, Latin America as well. The economic needs of emerging Third World states made them vulnerable to foreign influence and pressure. The era was characterized by a proliferation of anti-colonial national liberation movements, backed predominantly by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The Soviet leadership took a keen interest in the affairs of the fledgling ex- colonies because it hoped the cultivation of socialist clients there would deny their economic and strategic resources to the West. Eager to build its own global constituency, the People's Republic of China attempted to assume a leadership role among the decolonizing territories as well, appealing to its image as a non-white, non-European agrarian nation which too had suffered from the depredations of Western imperialism. Both nations promoted global decolonization as an opportunity to redress the balance of the world against Western Europe and the United States, and claimed that the political and economic problems of colonized peoples made them naturally inclined towards socialism. Western fears of a conventional war with the communist bloc over the colonies soon shifted into fears of communist subversion and infiltration by proxy. The great disparities of wealth in many of the colonies between the colonized indigenous population and the colonizers provided fertile ground for the adoption of socialist ideology among many anti-colonial parties. This provided ammunition for Western propaganda which denounced many anti-colonial movements as being communist proxies. As pressure for decolonization mounted, the departing colonial regimes attempted to transfer power to moderate and stable local governments committed to continued economic and political ties with the West. Political transitions were not always peaceful; for example, violence broke out in Anglophone Southern Cameroons due to an unpopular union with Francophone Cameroon following independence from those respective nations. The Congo Crisis broke out with the dissolution of the Belgian Congo, after the new Congolese army mutinied against its Belgian officers, resulting in an exodus of the European population and plunging the territory into a civil war which raged throughout the mid-1960s. Portugal attempted to actively resist decolonization and was forced to contend with nationalist insurgencies in all of its African colonies until 1975. The presence of significant numbers of white settlers in Rhodesia complicated attempts at decolonization there, and the former actually issued a unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 to preempt an immediate transition to majority rule. The breakaway white government retained power in Rhodesia until 1979, despite a United Nations embargo and a devastating civil war with two rival guerrilla factions backed by the Soviets and Chinese, respectively. Third World alliances Some developing countries devised a strategy that turned the Cold War into what they called \\"creative confrontation\\" ‚Äì playing off the Cold War participants to their own advantage while maintaining non-aligned status. The diplomatic policy of non-alignment regarded the Cold War as a tragic and frustrating facet of international affairs, obstructing the overriding task of consolidating fledgling states and their attempts to end economic backwardness, poverty, and disease. Non-alignment held that peaceful coexistence with the first-world and second-world nations was both preferable and possible. India's Jawaharlal Nehru saw neutralism as a means of forging a \\"third force\\" among non-aligned nations, much as France's Charles de Gaulle attempted to do in Europe in the 1960s. The Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser manoeuvres between the blocs in pursuit of his goals was one example of this. The first such effort, the Asian Relations Conference, held in New Delhi in 1947, pledged support for all national movements against colonial rule and explored the basic problems of Asian peoples. Perhaps the most famous Third World conclave was the Bandung Conference of African and Asian nations in 1955 to discuss mutual interests and strategy, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. The conference was attended by twenty-nine countries representing more than half the population of the world. As at New Delhi, anti-imperialism, economic development, and cultural cooperation were the principal topics. There was a strong push in the Third World to secure a voice in the councils of nations, especially the United Nations, and to receive recognition of their new sovereign status. Representatives of these new states were also extremely sensitive to slights and discriminations, particularly if they were based on race. In all the nations of the Third World, living standards were wretchedly low. Some, such as India, Nigeria, and Indonesia, were becoming regional powers, most were too small and poor to aspire to this status. Initially having a roster of 51 members, the UN General Assembly had increased to 126 by 1970. The dominance of Western members dropped to 40% of the membership, with Afro-Asian states holding the balance of power. The ranks of the General Assembly swelled rapidly as former colonies won independence, thus forming a substantial voting bloc with members from Latin America. Anti-imperialist sentiment, reinforced by the communists, often translated into anti-Western positions, but the primary agenda among non-aligned countries was to secure passage of social and economic assistance measures. Superpower refusal to fund such programs has often undermined the effectiveness of the non-aligned coalition, however. The Bandung Conference symbolized continuing efforts to establish regional organizations designed to forge unity of policy and economic cooperation among Third World nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was created in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1963 because African leaders believed that disunity played into the hands of the superpowers. The OAU was designed :to promote the unity and solidarity of the African states; to coordinate and intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for the peoples of Africa; to defend their sovereignty; to eradicate all forms of colonialism in Africa and to promote international cooperation... The OAU required a policy of non- alignment from each of its 30 member states and spawned several subregional economic groups similar in concept to the European Common Market. The OAU has also pursued a policy of political cooperation with other Third World regional coalitions, especially with Arab countries. Much of the frustration expressed by non-aligned nations stemmed from the vastly unequal relationship between rich and poor states. The resentment, strongest where key resources and local economies have been exploited by multinational Western corporations, has had a major impact on world events. The formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960 reflected these concerns. OPEC devised a strategy of counter-penetration, whereby it hoped to make industrial economies that relied heavily on oil imports vulnerable to Third World pressures. Initially, the strategy had resounding success. Dwindling foreign aid from the United States and its allies, coupled with the West's pro-Israel policies, angered the Arab nations in OPEC. In 1973, the group quadrupled the price of crude oil. The sudden rise in the energy costs intensified inflation and recession in the West and underscored the interdependence of world societies. The next year the non-aligned bloc in the United Nations passed a resolution demanding the creation of a new international economic order in which resources, trade, and markets would be distributed fairly. Non-aligned states forged still other forms of economic cooperation as leverage against the superpowers. OPEC, the OAU, and the Arab League had overlapping members, and in the 1970s the Arabs began extending huge financial assistance to African nations in an effort to reduce African economic dependence on the United States and the Soviet Union. However, the Arab League has been torn by dissension between authoritarian pro-Soviet states, such as Nasser's Egypt and Assad's Syria, and the aristocratic-monarchial (and generally pro-Western) regimes, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman. And while the OAU has witnessed some gains in African cooperation, its members were generally primarily interested in pursuing their own national interests rather than those of continental dimensions. At a 1977 Afro-Arab summit conference in Cairo, oil producers pledged $1.5 billion in aid to Africa. Recent divisions within OPEC have made concerted action more difficult. Nevertheless, the 1973 world oil shock provided dramatic evidence of the potential power of resource suppliers in dealing with the more developed world. Cuban Revolution and Cuban Missile Crisis The years between the Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the arms control treaties of the 1970s marked growing efforts for both the Soviet Union and the United States to keep control over their spheres of influence. U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson landed 22,000 troops in the Dominican Republic in 1965, claiming to prevent the emergence of another Cuban Revolution. While the period from 1962 until D√©tente had no incidents as dangerous as the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was an increasing loss of legitimacy and good will worldwide for both the major Cold War participants. 30 September Movement The 30 September Movement was a self-proclaimed organization of Indonesian National Armed Forces members who, in the early hours of 1 October 1965, assassinated six Indonesian Army generals in an abortive coup d'√©tat. Among those killed was Minister/Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Ahmad Yani. Future president Suharto, who was not targeted by the kidnappers, took command of the army, persuaded the soldiers occupying Jakarta's central square to surrender and oversaw the end of the coup. A smaller rebellion in central Java also collapsed. The army publicly blamed the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) for the coup attempt, and in October, mass killings of suspected communists began. In March 1966, Suharto, now in receipt of a document from Sukarno giving him authprioty to restore order, banned the PKI. A year later he replaced Sukarno as president, establishing the strongly anti-communist 'New Order regime. 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia Barricades and Soviet tanks on fire. A period of political liberalization took place in 1968 in Eastern Bloc country Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring. The event was spurred by several events, including economic reforms that addressed an early 1960s economic downturn. In April, Czechoslovakian leader Alexander Dubƒçek launched an \\"Action Program\\" of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government and limiting the power of the secret police.Ello (ed.), Paul (April 1968). Control Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, \\"Action Plan of the (Prague, April 1968)\\" in Dubcek's Blueprint for Freedom: His original documents leading to the invasion of Czechoslovakia. William Kimber & Co. 1968, pp 32, 54 Initial reaction within the Eastern Bloc was mixed, with Hungary's J√°nos K√°d√°r expressing support, while Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubƒçek's reforms, which they feared might weaken the Eastern Bloc's position during the Cold War. On August 3, representatives from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration, which declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism- Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against \\"bourgeois\\" ideology and all \\"anti-socialist\\" forces. On the night of August 20‚Äì21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries ‚Äì the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary ‚Äì invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion comported with the Brezhnev Doctrine, a policy of compelling Eastern Bloc states to subordinate national interests to those of the Bloc as a whole and the exercise of a Soviet right to intervene if an Eastern Bloc country appeared to shift towards capitalism. The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. In April 1969, Dubƒçek was replaced as first secretary by Gust√°v Hus√°k, and a period of \\"normalization\\" began. Hus√°k reversed Dubƒçek's reforms, purged the party of liberal members, dismissed opponents from public office, reinstated the power of the police authorities, sought to re-centralize the economy and re-instated the disallowance of political commentary in mainstream media and by persons not considered to have \\"full political trust\\". The international image of the Soviet Union suffered considerably, especially among Western student movements inspired by the \\"New Left\\" and non-Aligned Movement states. Mao Zedong's People's Republic of China, for example, condemned both the Soviets and the Americans as imperialists. Vietnam War U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson landed 42,000 troops in the Dominican Republic in 1965 to prevent the emergence of \\"another Fidel Castro.\\" More notable in 1965, however, was U.S. intervention in Southeast Asia. In 1965 Johnson stationed 22,000 troops in South Vietnam to prop up the faltering anticommunist regime. The South Vietnamese government had long been allied with the United States. The North Vietnamese under Ho Chi Minh were backed by the Soviet Union and China. North Vietnam, in turn, supported the National Liberation Front, which drew its ranks from the South Vietnamese working class and peasantry. Seeking to contain Communist expansion, Johnson increased the number of troops to 575,000 in 1968. Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin (left) with U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference. North Vietnam received Soviet approval for its war effort in 1959; the Soviet Union sent 15,000 military advisors and annual arms shipments worth $450 million to North Vietnam during the war, while China sent 320,000 troops and annual arms shipments worth $180 million.Qiang Zhai, China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950‚Äì1975 (University of North Carolina Press, 2000), p135; Gen. Oleg Sarin and Col. Lev Dvoretsky, Alien Wars: The Soviet Union's Aggressions Against the World, 1919 to 1989 (Presidio Press, 1996), pp93-4. While the early years of the war had significant U.S. casualties, the administration assured the public that the war was winnable and would in the near future result in a U.S. victory. The U.S. public's faith in \\"the light at the end of the tunnel\\" was shattered on January 30, 1968, when the NLF mounted the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam. Although neither of these offensives accomplished any military objectives, the surprising capacity of an enemy to even launch such an offensive convinced many in the U.S. that victory was impossible. A vocal and growing peace movement centered on college campuses became a prominent feature as the counter culture of the 1960s adopted a vocal anti-war position. Especially unpopular was the draft that threatened to send young men to fight in the jungles of Southeast Asia. Elected in 1968, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon began a policy of slow disengagement from the war. The goal was to gradually build up the South Vietnamese Army so that it could fight the war on its own. This policy became the cornerstone of the so-called \\"Nixon Doctrine.\\" As applied to Vietnam, the doctrine was called \\"Vietnamization.\\" The goal of Vietnamization was to enable the South Vietnamese army to increasingly hold its own against the NLF and the North Vietnamese Army. L-R: Llewellyn Thompson, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Dean Rusk On October 10, 1969, Nixon ordered a squadron of 18 B-52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of Soviet airspace in order to convince the Soviet Union that he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War. The morality of U.S. conduct of the war continued to be an issue under the Nixon presidency. In 1969, it came to light that Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader in Vietnam, had led a massacre of Vietnamese civilians a year earlier. In 1970, Nixon ordered secret military incursions into Cambodia in order to destroy NLF sanctuaries bordering on South Vietnam. The U.S. pulled its troops out of Vietnam in 1973, and the conflict finally ended in 1975 when the North Vietnamese took Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties). 195,000‚Äì430,000 South Vietnamese civilians died in the war.Lewy, Guenter (1978). America in Vietnam.

Defense Department officials concluded that these body- count figures need to be deflated by 30 percent. In addition, Guenter Lewy assumes that one-third of the reported \\"enemy\\" killed may have been civilians, concluding that the actual number of deaths of communist military forces was probably closer to 444,000.

Nixon Doctrine Richard Nixon shaking hands with armed forces in Vietnam (1969) By the last years of the Nixon administration, it had become clear that it was the Third World that remained the most volatile and dangerous source of world instability. Central to the Nixon-Kissinger policy toward the Third World was the effort to maintain a stable status quo without involving the United States too deeply in local disputes. In 1969 and 1970, in response to the height of the Vietnam War, the President laid out the elements of what became known as the Nixon Doctrine, by which the United States would \\"participate in the defense and development of allies and friends\\" but would leave the \\"basic responsibility\\" for the future of those \\"friends\\" to the nations themselves. The Nixon Doctrine signified a growing contempt by the U.S. government for the United Nations, where underdeveloped nations were gaining influence through their sheer numbers, and increasing support to authoritarian regimes attempting to withstand popular challenges from within. In the 1970s, for example, the CIA poured substantial funds into Chile to help support the established government against a Marxist challenge. When the Marxist candidate for president, Salvador Allende, came to power through free elections, the United States began funneling more money to opposition forces to help \\"destabilize\\" the new government. In 1973, a U.S.-backed military junta seized power from Allende. The new, repressive regime of General Augusto Pinochet received warm approval and increased military and economic assistance from the United States as an anti-Communist ally. Democracy was finally re-established in Chile in 1989. Sino‚ÄìSoviet split Cold War alliances 1975 The People's Republic of China's Great Leap Forward and other policies based on agriculture instead of heavy industry challenged the Soviet-style socialism and the signs of the USSR's influence over the socialist countries. As \\"de-Stalinization\\" went forward in the Soviet Union, China's revolutionary founder, Mao Zedong, condemned the Soviets for \\"revisionism.\\" The Chinese also were growing increasingly annoyed at being constantly in the number two role in the communist world. In the 1960s, an open split began to develop between the two powers; the tension lead to a series of border skirmishes along the Chinese-Soviet border. The Sino-Soviet split had important ramifications in Southeast Asia. Despite having received substantial aid from China during their long wars, the Vietnamese communists aligned themselves with the Soviet Union against China. The Khmer Rouge had taken control of Cambodia in 1975 and became one of the most brutal regimes in world history. The newly unified Vietnam and the Khmer regime had poor relations from the outset as the Khmer Rouge began massacring ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia, and then launched raiding parties into Vietnam. The Khmer Rouge allied itself with China, but this was not enough to prevent the Vietnamese from invading them and destroying the regime in 1979. While unable to save their Cambodian allies, the Chinese did respond to the Vietnamese by invading the north of Vietnam on a punitive expedition later in that year. After a few months of heavy fighting and casualties on both sides, the Chinese announced the operation was complete and withdrew, ending the fighting. The United States played only a minor role in these events, unwilling to get involved in the region after its debacle in Vietnam. The extremely visible disintegration of the communist bloc played an important role in the easing of Sino-American tensions and in the progress towards East-West D√©tente. D√©tente and changing alliance Brezhnev and Nixon talk while standing on the White House balcony during Brezhnev's 1973 visit to Washington ‚Äì a high- water mark in d√©tente between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs. The Soviet Union achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States. From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated. China, Japan, and Western Europe; the increasing nationalism of the Third World, and the growing disunity within the communist alliance all augured a new multipolar international structure. Moreover, the 1973 world oil shock created a dramatic shift in the economic fortunes of the superpowers. The rapid increase in the price of oil devastated the U.S. economy leading to \\"stagflation\\" and slow growth. D√©tente had both strategic and economic benefits for both sides of the Cold War, buoyed by their common interest in trying to check the further spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons. President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT I treaty to limit the development of strategic weapons. Arms control enabled both superpowers to slow the spiraling increases in their bloated defense budgets. At the same time, divided Europe began to pursue closer relations. The Ostpolitik of German chancellor Willy Brandt lead to the recognition of East Germany. Remains of the \\"Iron curtain\\" in Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves, Bratislava (Slovakia) (2007) Cooperation on the Helsinki Accords led to several agreements on politics, economics and human rights. A series of arms control agreements such as SALT I and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty were created to limit the development of strategic weapons and slow the arms race. There was also a rapprochement between China and the United States. The People's Republic of China joined the United Nations, and trade and cultural ties were initiated, most notably Nixon's groundbreaking trip to China in 1972. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union concluded friendship and cooperation treaties with several states in the noncommunist world, especially among Third World and Non-Aligned Movement states. During D√©tente, competition continued, especially in the Middle East and southern and eastern Africa. The two nations continued to compete with each other for influence in the resource-rich Third World. There was also increasing criticism of U.S. support for the Suharto regime in Indonesia, Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile, and Mobuto Sese Seko's regime in Zaire. The war in Vietnam and the Watergate crisis shattered confidence in the presidency. International frustrations, including the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the hostage crisis in Iran from 1979-1981, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the growth of international terrorism, and the acceleration of the arms race raised fears over the country's foreign policy. The energy crisis, unemployment, and inflation, derided as \\"stagflation,\\" raised fundamental questions over the future of American prosperity. At the same time, the oil-rich USSR benefited immensely, and the influx of oil wealth helped disguise the many systemic flaws in the Soviet economy. At the same time, the entire Eastern Bloc continued to experience massive stagnation, consumer goods shortfalls in shortage economies, developmental stagnation and large housing quantity and quality shortfalls. Culture and media The preoccupation of Cold War themes in popular culture continued during the 1960s and 1970s. One of the better-known films of the period was the 1964 black comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Peter Sellers. In the film, a mad United States general overrides the President's authority and orders a nuclear air strike on the Soviet Union. The film became a hit and today remains a classic. In the United Kingdom, meanwhile, The War Game, a BBC television film written, directed, and produced by Peter Watkins was a Cold War piece of a darker nature. The film, depicting the impact of Soviet nuclear attack on England, caused dismay within both the BBC and in government. It was originally scheduled to air on August 6, 1966 (the anniversary of the Hiroshima attack) but was not transmitted until 1985. In the 2011 superhero film, X-Men: First Class, the Cold War is portrayed to be controlled by a group of mutants that call themselves the Hell Fire Club. In the summer of 1976, a mysterious and seemingly very powerful signal began infiltrating radio receivers around the globe. It has a signature 'knocking' sound when heard, and because the origin of this powerful signal was somewhere in the Soviet Union, the signal was given the nickname Russian Woodpecker. Many amateur radio listeners believed it to be part of the Soviet Unions over-the-horizon radar, however the Soviets denied they had anything to do with such signal. Between 1976 and 1989, the signal would come and go on many occasions and was most prominent on the shortwave radio bands. It was not until the end of the Cold War that the Russians admitted these radar pings were indeed that of Duga, an advanced over-the-horizon radar system. The 2004 video game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is set in 1964 and deals heavily with the themes of nuclear deterrence, covert operations, and the Cold War. The 2010 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops is set during this period of the Cold War. Significant documents *Partial or Limited Test Ban Treaty (PTBT/LTBT): 1963. Also put forth by Kennedy; banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space. However, neither France nor China (both Nuclear Weapon States) signed. *Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT): 1968. Established the U.S., USSR, UK, France, and China as five \\"Nuclear-Weapon States\\". Non-Nuclear Weapon states were prohibited from (among other things) possessing, manufacturing, or acquiring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. All 187 signatories were committed to the goal of (eventual) nuclear disarmament. *Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM): 1972. Entered into between the U.S. and USSR to limit the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against missile-delivered nuclear weapons; ended by the U.S. in 2002. *Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties I & II (SALT I & II): 1972 / 1979. Limited the growth of U.S. and Soviet missile arsenals. *Prevention of Nuclear War Agreement: 1973. Committed the U.S. and USSR to consult with one another during conditions of nuclear confrontation.

He is best known for being honored as the \\"Employee of the Century\\" by the U.S. Department of Labor for his unparalleled reliability. Biography Winston was born and raised in Oklahoma Territory. His first job, at age 10, was picking cotton. In 1918, his family moved to California. Winston graduated from Jefferson High School in 1922 and got a job working for the Los Angeles Railway for four years before quitting because a black man could not drive a bus. He returned to work in January 1934 for the Los Angeles Railway where his income was 41 cents an hour. In 1925, he married Frances Smith. The couple had four children and five grandchildren, a number of great- grandchildren and a great-great grandson. The Winstons were married for 64 years until her death at age 82 in 1989; the sick day Winston took to attend his wife's funeral was the only instance he missed work in 72 years. Winston stayed with the agency through its name changes, starting from the Los Angeles Railway which became Los Angeles Transit Lines in 1945, to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority created in 1958, the Southern California Rapid Transit District created in 1964, and as it is known today Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority \\"Metro\\" created in 1993. In 1996, President Bill Clinton awarded Winston the \\"Employee of the Century\\" citation for his work ethic and dedication. He is the most reliable worker that the United States Department of Labor has ever chronicled. He worked for 72 years without arriving late or leaving early and having taken the single sick day. He attributed his work ethic to his upbringing, asserting that his father taught him the value of hard work at an early age. Upon his retirement on his 100th birthday, he stated that he was planning to visit his 98-year-old brother in Tennessee and had the intention of remaining active in various endeavors. \\"I'm going to keep active. I can't afford to just sit down. I wouldn't do that,\\" he said. \\"I don't drink and I don't smoke, so I feel alright.\\" Winston died of heart failure at his great-granddaughter's home in Los Angeles on April 13, 2006, less than one month after his retirement. He is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. The Arthur Winston/Mid-Cities busyard in Leimert Park, Los Angeles is named in his honor.

The Court re-examined the authority of tribunals to hear constitutional challenges and their power to strike down legislation under section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. In doing so the Court overturned the previous decision of Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), (1996). Also, the Court struck down provisions within Nova Scotia's Workers' Compensation Act that prohibited people who were disabled by chronic pain from benefits as a violation of section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Background Donald Martin and Ruth Laseur both suffered from chronic pain caused by work injuries. They attempted to claim compensation from the injury but the Worker's Compensation Board denied any benefits. They challenged the Worker's Compensation Act as a violation of equality rights under section 15(1) of the Charter for denying benefits to those with chronic pain. The Appeals Tribunal held that the Charter was violated in Martin's case. The government appealed the decision and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that the tribunal did not have the authority to apply the Charter. To arrive at this conclusion the court had followed the Cooper case. In that decision the Supreme Court was divided on when the Charter could be used. McLachlin argued that the Charter belonged \\"to the people\\" and so must be granted liberally. Lamer had argued otherwise, stating that only courts of proper authority could use it. The compromise was that it could only be used where there was clear legislative intent. On the facts here there was no clear legislative intent and so the appeal court found no authority. Reasons of the court The Court held that the tribunal had the authority to apply the Charter and found that the Act did violate it. Consequently, Martin was given the benefits and Laseur's case was sent back to the tribunal for reconsideration. Justice Gonthier, writing for a unanimous Court, considered the question of whether the Charter could be applied by the tribunal. Gonthier stated that if the text of the legislation gives the tribunal authority to apply the law then it can also apply the Charter. In the case where there is no express authority to apply law then the court can look for implied authority by considering the statute as a whole. Factors to be considered include the mandate of the tribunal, whether the body is adjudicative in nature, and whether it possesses any other characteristics of the administrative system. If the claimant successfully argues that the tribunal has authority to use the Charter, the party opposing this can rebut the presumption by either showing that there is explicit withdrawal of the authority by the legislature, or by showing that the statutory scheme points to an intention to exclude the authority.

Organization The Council is headed by its president, who is chosen from among the members of the Council by the Cabinet of Greece for a term of four years. The court comprises the presiding board (the President and 7 Vice- presidents), 42 Privy Councillors, 48 Associate Judges and 50 Reporting Judges, all graduates of the National School of Judges. The Council is seated in the Arsakeion building in the centre of Athens. The Council executes its jurisdiction in Plenary Session or in six Chambers-Judicial Formations ( Œë', Œí', Œì', Œî', Œï' and Œ£Œ§' ). Each Chamber may have two compositions: five-member or seven-member. The jurisdiction of the Plenary Session is determined by the law (Legislative Decree 170/1973, Article 14), while the competence of the Chambers is determined by the law and the presidential decrees, proposed by the Minister of Justice after an opinion of the Council. After the Constitutional Amendment of 2001 the Plenary Session (and not the Chambers) is the only competent to judge the constitutionality of laws. The Plenary Session is, also, competent: a) for cases of general interest that the President introduces directly into it, b) for cases that one of the Chambers submits to it. These cases are submitted by the Chambers to the Plenary Session for two reasons: either because they are cases of general interest or because the applicable legislative provision is judged unconstitutional. History The Council was first founded in 1835 and it constituted an imitation of the French Conseil d'√âtat. It had advisory competence with respect to the draft decrees and administrative jurisdiction, issuing irrevocable decisions. The Council was suppressed by the Constitution of 1844 (article 102). Following the deposing of King Otto in 1862, the National Assembly that was convened decided to re-establish the Council in order to \\"prepare and deliberate on law proposals\\". The new 1864 Constitution provided for a revision of this in the forthcoming parliamentary session, provided that a 3/4 majority voted against it. On 25 November 1865 a law was passed that abolished the Council of State again. Although the Constitution of 1911 provided for its re-establishment, it was not refounded until 1928 (Law 3713/1928 as it has been repeatedly revised), after the adoption of the Constitution of 1927 (articles 102-105). Its first president, from 1928 until 1935, was Konstantinos Raktivan. Its jurisdiction and composition is now provided for in the Constitution of 1975/1985/2001 (article 95), the Law 170/1973 (as revised) and the Presidential Decree 18/1989. Administrative competence The administrative competence of the Council, as one of the three Big Bodies of the Public Administration (the other two are the Chamber of Accounts and the Hellenic Legal Council) is regulated by the article 95 of the Constitution of 1974/1985/2001 and consists in the elaboration of all the regulative decrees, namely of all the decrees that include impersonal (nor referring to a particular person) legal rules. Competent for this elaboration is the fifth (Œï' ) Chamber of the Council, composed, for such cases, of three or five members. The Chamber may, at its option, submit the case to the nine member Plenary Session. The submission is obligatory for the Chamber, when the constitutionality of the relevant to the decree legal provisions is judged (article 100 of the Constitution after the Amendment of 2001). The Administration is obliged to send the regulative decrees to the Conseil for elaboration but it is not obliged to follow the consultory response of the Council. Nonetheless, the Administration usually abides by the Council's opinion. A promulgated regulative decree, if not sent to the Council for elaboration before its promulgation, shall be annulled, if a recourse (writ of annulment) is submitted to the competent court (the Conseil d' Etat or the Administrative Court of Appeals). The elaboration of the decrees by the Council is limited to the lato sensu legality (and the constitutionality of the relevant legal provisions) of the decrees, while the respective control of the French Conseil d'√âtat goes to the substance of the context of the elaborated decree. Litigation The Council is the head of the system of administrative justice and it constitutes the Supreme Administrative Court. A case is introduced into the Council with the following legal means or remedies: * the recourse (Œ±ŒØœÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ±Œ∫œçœÅœâœÉŒ∑œÇ; the accurate translation is writ of annulment), with which the annulment of an administrative act is pursued. The Council judges only the legal aspects of the case and not the true facts. Its decision includes a judgement about legality and not a control upon the merits. * the writ of certiorari (Œ±ŒØœÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒπœÅŒ≠œÉŒµœâœÇ) against the decisions of the lower administrative courts (Administrative Courts of First Instance and Administrative Courts of Appeals), which judge recourses (œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜœÖŒ≥Œ≠œÇ) and their decisions include a control upon the merits. The writ of certiorari is constitutionally consolidated (article 95 of the Constitution 1975/1986/2001) and places the Council at the top of the administrative branch of justice, because it has the last word in the legal aspects of every administrative litigation. * the clerical recourse, with which disputes between the State and the civil servants are introduced into the Council. The decision of the Council includes a judgement both about the legality and upon the merits of the case. * the appeal against the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeals, which judges at first instance certain writs of annulment (according to the provisions of the Law 702/1977). In this case, the Council judges as a court of appeals and the Administrative Court of Appeals as a court of first instance. Acts of government Following the jurisprudence of the French Conseil d'√âtat, the Council refuses to examine the legality of certain administrative acts, which are called \\"acts of government\\". The Council includes in this limited category: * acts regulating the relationships between the executive branch and the Parliament, such as the dissolution of the Parliament or the act proclaiming a referendum. * acts connected with the foreign policy of Greece, such as international conventions, acts promulgated for the application of international treaties, acts relevant to the diplomatic protection of Greek citizens abroad etc. * the declaration of mobilisation. * the granting of pardons. Procedure The procedure is based on the principles of the \\"inquisitorial system\\" and of the initiative of the litigant. According to this last principle the litigant is responsible for the commencement of the procedure.  International relations  The Council of State is a founding member of the International Association of Supreme Administrative Courts and, since Greece‚Äôs accession to the European Union, of the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union. It also participates to the Commission of Venice, the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters.

She was portrayed by actress Heather Langenkamp in the series' first and third film, and by Rooney Mara in the 2010 remake, in which she was renamed Nancy Holbrook. Introduced in the 1984 original film, Nancy is the first person to battle Freddy Krueger and survive. In A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), she guides the last of the Elm Street children in their battle against Freddy. In Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994), Langenkamp must become Nancy once again to put an end to an entity embodying Freddy in the \\"real world\\". The character also appears in the A Nightmare on Elm Street expanded universe, appearing in the comic book series, novels, video games and the 2010 reboot. A popular A Nightmare on Elm Street character, Nancy has been called a 1980s icon and has often been regarded as one of the most significant female protagonists in horror cinema. She has also been regarded as a prominent figure in American pop culture. Appearances In films Nancy Thompson In the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, Nancy Thompson is a 16-year-old girl whose parents, Donald and Marge, divorced when she was little. Marge now lives with Nancy as a single parent on 1428 Elm Street. Nancy is experiencing nightmares about a mysterious, disfigured man in a red and green sweater. The man has \\"knives for fingers\\", which he scrapes along objects in the dream. She learns that her friend Tina Gray is having similar nightmares; Tina is murdered in her sleep later that night. Tina's boyfriend Rod tells Nancy that he saw four \\"invisible\\" razors cutting her at the same time, a revelation which convinces her that the man from her dreams is connected to the murder. Nancy begins relying on caffeine to stay awake, and develops sleep disorders such as Insomnia and night terror resulting from her sleep deprivation and nightmares. She discovers that she can pull things out of her dream after she takes the killer's hat, labelled \\"Fred Krueger\\". Her mother explains that Krueger was a child killer who was burned to death by vengeful parents who live in their street after being freed from prison on a technicality. Nancy becomes convinced that he is exacting his revenge on the children of his killers from beyond the grave. Being tormented by Krueger every time she fall asleep causes tremendous stress to Nancy; her hair becomes prematurely grey, while Nancy notes that she looks like a woman in her twenties. With all of her friends dead, Nancy forms a plan to face Krueger and pull him into the real world, where he falls victim to a series of booby traps she has set up. Nancy finally defeats Krueger by taking back the energy she has given him and stripping away his power. Although Nancy does not appear in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, she maintains a presence when a new family moves into the house where she battled Freddy Krueger. Teenager Jesse Walsh, who inhabits Nancy's old room and his girlfriend Lisa discover Nancy's old diary, which chronicles the events of the first film. It tells them of the murders of Nancy's friends and also reveals Krueger's strengths and weaknesses. This helps Jesse and Lisa conquer Freddy in their own struggle with him. In A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, at age 22, Nancy is re-introduced as the new intern therapist at Westin Hills Mental Institution. Despite not having received her doctorate, Nancy is at the top of her class at graduate school and makes groundbreaking research on pattern nightmares (nightmare disorder); her studies are based on investigation of her own experiences. She is on the verge of becoming an authority on sleep disorders despite her young age and qualified to work with the hospital's doctors despite still being a student. Nancy meets the last surviving children of the parents who killed Fred Krueger. For six years, she is dedicated to finding a way to stop Krueger and tracks his activities and targets. Dr. Neil Gordon is initially reluctant to work with Nancy but agrees after he sees her bond with one of his patients, Kristen Parker. Nancy knows that Kristen's mother, Elaine, participated in Krueger's murder but Elaine initially fails to realize that Nancy is Donald and Marge Thompson's daughter. Nancy and Neil also begin dating despite their age differences. When Nancy realizes the children are falling victim to Freddy, she begs that they be prescribed Hypnocil, an experimental drug, which she has been using to suppress her dreams, in an effort to protect them. In a therapy session, Nancy uses hypnosis to put everybody to sleep and teach them how to use their \\"dream powers\\" to their advantage. However, she and Neil are fired when Hypnocil is blamed for a patient falling into a coma. Neil and Nancy learn from a mysterious elderly nun, revealed later to be the spirit of Freddy's mother Amanda Krueger, of Freddy's origins and that in order to defeat him they must lay his bones to rest. Nancy contacts her father to find out what the town's parents did with Freddy's remains. As Neil and Donald go to bury Freddy's bones, Nancy returns to Westin Hills and rejoins the patients in the dream world, where they use their dream powers against Freddy. Freddy tricks Nancy when he appears to her as Donald and stabs her in the abdomen with his clawed glove, killing her in the real world. After rising a final time to stab Freddy with his own glove before he can kill Kristen, Nancy dies and Krueger disappears as Neil covers Freddy's remains in holy water and a crucifix, and buries them. Kristen states that she intends to place Nancy into a \\"beautiful dream\\". Nancy's tombstone is seen briefly in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. To some extent Nancy reappears in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. The story, set in the \\"real world\\", focuses on actress Heather Langenkamp being stalked by a malevolent entity as the tenth anniversary of the release of the original film A Nightmare on Elm Street approaches. Heather learns from Wes Craven that the entity was locked in Freddy Krueger's character through the Nightmare on Elm Street film series. With the series ended after Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare the entity has been set free, and wants to cross over into the real world in the form of Freddy Krueger. It views Heather as an enemy, seeing her as Nancy, who originally defeated him. Like Nancy, Heather's hair also turns prematurely grey under the stress of Krueger's attacks in addition to the reality overlapping with his fictitious world. In order to battle the entity, who has kidnapped Heather's son Dylan Porter, Heather enters the dream world, where she traps him in a furnace and seemingly destroys him. However, Krueger's creator states that the entity is imprisoned in the film franchise's make-believe world once more. Though she only appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in Freddy vs. Jason, she maintains somewhat of a presence: her former home is now occupied by Lori Campbell. Clips featuring Nancy appears in the documentary film The Nightmare (2015). Nancy Holbrook In the 2010 remake, Nancy's last name is changed to \\"Holbrook\\", portrayed by Rooney Mara. Kyra Krumins also portrayed the character as a preadolescent in the film's flashbacks and dream sequences. She is also based on the franchise's other heroine Alice Johnson due to Nancy's job as a waitress. In this film, she is portrayed as an 18-year-old socially unavailable outcast who loves art. Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner), another high school outcast, crushes on her, and tries hard constantly to hit on her, but ends up failing. However, she does take partnership with him as they try to investigate the deaths of their three friends: Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), and Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), all of which died in their sleep, and both claiming to see a man matching the same description: a burnt face. As the result of their sleep deprivation, both Nancy and Quentin develop sleep disorders such as insomnia and recurring microsleep episodes, causing them to develop hypnagogia and their supernatural stalker begins to be able to reach them from the dreamworld. When they discover that both she, Quentin, Kris, Jesse, and Dean all went to preschool together when they were little, they don't understand, seeing how they didn't know each other until high school. When Nancy's mother Gwen (Connie Britton) catches the both of them, she finally admits that as children, they and all the kids in the preschool were molested by a man named Fred Krueger, the school gardener who resided in the preschool's basement. She claims that Freddy fled the area before they could turn him in, and that their dreams of Freddy are just repressed memories. However, when Quentin learns the truth through one of Freddy's dreams when he falls asleep in swim class, they both confront Quentin's father Alan (Clancy Brown) for killing Freddy when the parents had chased him down, and Alan through a fire-lit gasoline gallon into a shed where Freddy hid, despite not there being any evidence that he was molesting them. Alan admits regret for his actions, but also defends them, saying they were only trying to protect them. Quentin storms out in anger, as a guilt-stricken Alan instructs Nancy to never reveal to anyone who Freddy was. Still unable to understand, Nancy and Quentin decide to go to the preschool to find answers, and when they arrive, it is revealed that Freddy was in fact molesting the children when they discover pictures of Nancy as a child (though never shown only implied). With their memories back, they realize that Freddy isn't after them because they lied about him, but because they told the truth about him. When Nancy sees a piece of Freddy's sweater she pulled out from a hallucination before, she realizes that Freddy needs to be pulled into the real world to be defeated. When she does, she defeats Freddy by slicing off his clawed hand with a broken paper cutter blade, and finishes the job by slicing his throat. They burn down the preschool with Freddy's corpse inside, and she and Quentin escape, with Quentin hospitalized. Nancy also reciprocates Quentin's feelings for her. Nancy returns home, and thanks her mother for trying to protect her, but Freddy appears in a mirror behind Gwen. He kills her, and drags her body into the mirror, with Nancy screaming. Bollywood adaption In the Bollywood adaption called Mahakaal (1994) by the Ramsay Brothers, Nancy's analogue is called Anita and is played by actress Archana Puran Singh. Much like the original Nancy, Anita is the daughter of a policeman who killed Shakaal (the placeholder for Freddy's character) for murdering his young daughter, Anita's sister, as deleted scenes from Wes Craven's film hinted. She and her friends are college students instead of attending high school like Nancy. Anita has been criticized for being overly passive and doing little more than running away and screaming, unlike Nancy Thompson who was a fighter who used her wits to take on Freddy head on.() In literature Nancy Thompson appears in the 1991 short story collection The Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger's Seven Sweetest Dreams. In the story \\"Asleep at the Wheel\\", Freddy Krueger and Nancy Thompson are long dead, and they are considered urban legends or the result of mass hysteria due to Springwood's scandalous history. The pretentious band Nancy Thompson Grave Watch, which includes songwriter and guitarist Ian, is renting the dilapidated house at 1428 Elm Street for musical inspiration. Nancy's spirit‚Äîstill suffering from the stab wounds that she received following the events of Dream Warriors (which turn into four disfigured fetuses to symbolize the children that Nancy would have given birth to had she survived)‚Äîappears in Ian's dreams to warn him that Freddy's murderous legacy is indeed real. Nancy and the events of Dream Warriors are mentioned in the story \\"Le Morte De Freddy\\". Dr. Andy Curtis of Springwood Mental Health Center is struggling to treat Gayle Ann Millikin, an adolescent patient who is suffering from self imposed insomnia. When other teenagers start exhibiting similar sleep disorders, Dr. Curtis is encouraged to study the archived files of Westin HIlls (which had closed five years prior to the story's events) and Dr. Neil Gordon's research. Nancy returned in Nightmares on Elm Street, a canonical six-issue comic book series published by Innovation Comics from 1991 to 1992. In the story, Nancy teams up with several other characters from the film series, including Neil Gordon, Jacob Johnson and Alice Johnson, to fight Freddy in his nightmare world. The events of this series were meant to fill in the time period between the A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare films. The series was written by Andy Mangels. The first two issues of the story explain to the readers about Nancy's life in between parts one and three. After the events of part one, Nancy had been sent to an institution by her father until she was \\"rational\\" again. Around the time she was in college after she was released, her father sold 1428 Elm Street to the Walsh family in Freddy's Revenge. In college, she studied psychology and sleep disorders, and made two friends in her roommates Cybil Houch and Priscilla Martin. After Nancy was fatally wounded by Freddy at the end of part three, Kristen had dreamed her soul into the Beautiful Dream, the good side of the dream world, where Nancy now acts as its agent as Freddy acts as an agent for the nightmare realm. In the story, Freddy begins targeting Cybil and Priscilla in an attempt to get to Nancy. He actually succeeds in killing Priscilla and Cybil's husband, James, before Nancy rescues Cybil. She is then reunited with Neil Gordon and the three of them realize that it might be impossible to fully destroy Freddy since he is pure evil, but it is possible to weaken him. Freddy is stopped and weakened by the dream-selves of unborn children, such as Cybil's unborn daughter, in a realm in the Beautiful Dream. The next four issues, titled Loose Ends, deals with the characters from previous Nightmare movies teaming up to defeat Freddy again. Here, Nancy is reunited with the soul of her father, who Freddy uses to try to kill her but is unsuccessful. Nancy defeats Freddy and manages to stop his plan of using Jacob Johnson to break into the real world with help from Neil Gordon and Devonne, a psychotic former accomplice of Freddy's. Nancy makes an appearance in the final issue of the crossover comic series Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors. In a battle against Freddy Krueger, Dream Master Jacob Johnson summons the spirits of Freddy's past victims, including Amanda Krueger and the Dream Warriors. Nancy also appears, reuniting with Neil Gordon to help him read the Necronomicons' passages needed to banish Freddy. With Freddy defeated, Nancy leaves Neil and returns to the afterlife with the other spirits.  In video games  Nancy shown among the \\"Dream Warriors\\" in the Commodore 64/MS-DOS game. In her debut game appearance, Nancy Thompson is a playable character in the 1989 A Nightmare on Elm Street video game. Released by Monarch Software and Westwood Associates, Nancy and the Dream Warriors are on a quest to stop Freddy Krueger. As each character has a dream power, Nancy has the ability to freeze enemies. Although not playable, Nancy makes a cameo appearance in Freddy's ending in Mortal Kombat (2011). Nancy is mentioned in Quentin Smith's biography in Dead by Daylight: :\\"When he heard that Nancy‚Äôs mother had disappeared, Quentin Smith knew instantly that their success had been short- lived. Although their plan had seemed to work flawlessly, Freddy Krueger had beaten death yet again. But Quentin wasn‚Äôt about to give up. It may take many attempts, but he vowed that somehow they would find a way to beat Freddy, once and for all. If he didn‚Äôt, it would only be a matter of time before Freddy would win and Nancy was lost...\\" Additionally, a variety of Freddy's in game \\"Add-Ons\\" are named after Nancy: Nancy's Sketch and Nancy's Masterpiece. Nancy was originally meant to be a playable survivor but the developers couldn't obtain the rights to the character. In popular culture Nancy Thompson is the only character featured in several A Nightmare on Elm Street merchandise. Kristen Parker is only featured in Screen Grabs: A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (a diorama released by Mezco Toys in 2007). Debbie, in mid- transformation as a cockroach, is featured as a Cinema of Fear 4 action figure (released by Mezco Toys in 2009). In 2008, Mezco Toyz Cinema of Fear Series 2 released a Nancy Thompson action figure‚Äîwhich recreates the famous bathtub scene in the original film. Within the same year, the Mezco Toyz Cinema of Fear Series 2 also released the diorama Screen Grabs: A Nightmare on Elm Street. The diorama recreates the bedroom scene in which Freddy creeps along the wall above a sleeping Nancy. McFarlane Pop Culture Masterworks released an A Nightmare on Elm Street 3-D poster, with Nancy featured prominently as the central figure. In 2002, NECA released an A Nightmare on Elm Street Snowglobe. The female within the globe resembles Nancy, with a stalking Freddy Krueger forming the globe's outside base. However, the product information never confirms if it is actually the character. In 2004, NECA also released a lunchbox and thermos set with the poster image from A Nightmare on Elm Street. Since May 2011, there has been an online petition for manufacturers to create a Nancy Thompson doll. Although not considered a part of the official film canon, Nancy Thompson has appeared in various fan films: * Krueger (A Tale from Elm Street) (2011; Blinky Productions): The film takes place during Lieutenant Donald Thompson's interrogation of Freddy Krueger. During the course of the interrogation, Donald shows a picture of his daughter Nancy in order to gain a confession from Freddy. She would figure into the events of future fan films produced by the same production company. In Krueger (A Walk Through Elm Street), Freddy interacts with Marge Thompson who is pregnant with Nancy. * The Confession of Fred Krueger (2015; Produced by Rebel Rouser Comics): The film takes place during the 1970s during Freddy Krueger's interrogation after his arrest. Donald Thompson (prior to his becoming a lieutenant) and Nancy Thompson make cameos in the film. * Don't Fall Asleep: The Film (2016; Produced by 3 Count & Go): Taking place between A Nightmare on Elm Street and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Nancy Thompson (played by Diandra Lazor) is struggling to maintain her sanity after she is checked into a psychiatric ward. The film includes narration from Heather Langenkamp. There are brief appearances by the canon characters Donald Thompson and Alice Johnson. The characters Cybil Houch and Priscilla Martin from the Nightmares on Elm Street six-issue comic book series (published by Innovation Comics in 1991) also make brief appearances. *Before the Nightmare (2017; Produced by Occult Classic): Taking place before A Nightmare on Elm Street, Donald Thompson (prior to his becoming a lieutenant) has a greater incentive to catch Freddy Krueger, as the \\"Springwood Slasher\\" has set his sights on an elementary school-aged Nancy Thompson. Conception In Wes Craven's original script for A Nightmare on Elm Street, Nancy Thompson was initially named Nancy Wilson. In the scene in which Tina, Nancy, and Glen are at Tina's house, Nancy describes a dream in which Freddy Krueger leered at her obscenely. Soon afterwards, when conversing with Glen, Nancy shows an earlier interest (at least when compared to the actual film) into why her and Tina dreamed of the same individual. While Nancy's character differs little than the actual film, the original script has scenes that emphasize her headstrong nature. The biggest change was in the original A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors script. Nancy was closer to her personality in the first film. She was not a dream researcher, nor did she have the mature and calm demeanor portrayed in the actual film. Instead, Nancy was brazen and street smart‚Äîat times heading straight into a potentially dangerous situation. Nancy's stubbornness was evident in that she had traveled through five states in search of her missing father, Donald Thompson (named \\"John\\" in the script). When first attacked by Freddy Krueger, Nancy tried to physically fend him off with her bare hands‚Äîdespite being shocked from dreaming again after a five- year time period. This contrasts with the actual film, in which she used a broken mirror shard to injure Freddy. While Nancy cared about the Westin Hill patients, the age disparity between her and the teenagers was not as emphasized. In fact, some of the teenaged patients and hospital workers initially mistake Nancy for a patient. Thus, Nancy was not written as acting maternal. Instead, Nancy acts more like a big sister to the patients. There are instances in which Nancy fights back against the medical authorities, dismissing Dr. Neil Gordon's (named Neil Guinness in the original script) insistence that she has Delayed Stress Syndrome. As with the first movie, Nancy dismisses any attacks on her sanity‚Äîas she knows that Freddy Krueger is real. With regard to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Heather Langenkamp stated her viewpoints about Nancy Thompson's characterization: :‚ÄúThe connection with Nancy was there. I never felt that comfortable in the skin of that role because...I just felt like the dialogue that they gave Nancy was so stiff and there was no sense of humour at all. She had barely anything going in that department at all and then she‚Äôs supposed to be having this quasi-love affair with Craig Wasson‚Äôs character... None of it really seemed to have a dynamic energy behind it and as a result I felt I didn‚Äôt know what Nancy was anymore. I was struggling to make something of her because she didn‚Äôt have that big of a role in some way. She was like a facilitator, she was always showing things like 'let me show you how to do this', 'let‚Äôs do it together' but she was never really moving the plot forward herself that much and as a result I didn‚Äôt feel like I did a very good job in that role. Then when I saw the movie I thought 'oh it‚Äôs not as bad as I thought' because actually the relationship I had with the kids does come through and she is a kind of a reassuring presence in the movie rather than this fighting, battle warrior that she was in the first movie. So I just had to get used to this different role that Nancy played...\\" Some significant scenes involving Nancy in Dream Warriors were either cut from the film or never filmed; Langenkamp and co-star Craig Wasson both refers to a scene they filmed in which they kissed, with Wasson stating that \\"No, we didn't have sex, but there was this one real hot kiss that just about melted the camera lens. Too bad they cut it\\". Another significant scene that does not feature Nancy but mentions her is the cut penultimate scene (before the final scene with the model house lighting up while Neil sleeps) in the shooting script between survivors Kristen Parker and Neil Gordon in which Neil hint that she's visiting him in his dreams post-mortem, similarly to Freddy but benevolent; this was carried over from the original script but was not ultimately included in the film. This idea of \\"the beautiful dream\\" would later be recycled in the Nightmares on Elm Street comics. Reception In his book Horror films of the 1980s, John Kenneth Muir references Nancy Thompson, stating the following: :\\"As written by Craven and performed by Langenkamp, Nancy is a rarity in the horror genre: an intelligent and insightful youth who is capable of connecting the important things in her life. Only Nancy can recognize the link between worlds for what it is, and look below the surface of reality because she is already trained to do so, through family history. Nancy is prepared in her battle with Freddy because, one senses, she has already detected the dark truth lurking beneath the affluent surface of Elm Street. She has suffered her parent's divorce, her father's absence, and her mother's alcoholism...Nancy is even compared explicitly to Hamlet...in that Hamlet stamps out the lies of his mother, an act which Nancy will repeat during the course of the film...\\" :\\"So the key to defeating her Freddy... is something that goes against Nancy's most prominent characteristic. She must turn her back on the dream demon. She must take back all the energy she gave him...This is Nancy's crisis: knowing when to dig for truth and confront the lies, and when to turn her back on the corruption and lies she has discovered...\\" :\\"The final girl must actively take steps to protect herself and vanquish evil. For example, Nancy buys a survivalist, self-defense manual and in the conclusion of Elm Street, baits Freddy into chasing her. She then runs him through a punishing course of booby traps...Unlike Laurie, whom Halloween depicts as a victim of unchangeable 'fate,' someone who must mount a defense on the fly, Nancy is armed for battle and ready to rock.\\" In his book Horror Movie Freak, Don Sumner also notes how Nancy was a different \\"final girl\\" despite following the rules of avoiding sex, drugs, and juvenile behavior. He mentions that \\"the stereotypes of the victimized female screaming in terror and hiding in the closet do not apply to Nancy as she sets out to trap Freddy and attack him with all of the vigor of a killer herself. Her active role and anti-victim posture broke the mold of the horror heroine...\\" In her book Visions of the Night: Dreams, Religion, and Psychology, Kelly Bulkeley compares Nancy Thompson to Dorothy Gale in Wizard of Oz in that \\"Nancy ultimately finds in her dreams the deep resources of personal strength to overcome an evil that the adult social world had failed to defeat.\\" Nancy's death in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is even given some interpretation. In her book Phallic Panic: Film, Horror and the Primal Uncanny, Barbara Creed notes that as \\"Nancy embraces her father's/Freddy's body and tells him that she has always loved him she is torn apart by his finger-blades. The point is that it is dangerous for children to want the love of their parents--disappointment, even death, is the final result.\\" Heather Langenkamp portrayed Nancy in the original series. The documentary The Making of Nightmare on Elm Street features a segment concerning the casting of Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson. According to Sara Risher, Langenkamp was chosen because Wes Craven wanted a \\"young girl who was smart-looking, obviously pretty, vulnerable, but clearly had a good head on her shoulders.\\" Langenkamp herself said that she identified with Nancy Thompson the most, stating that Nancy \\"had a great sense that she could solve problems without anybody's help at all. I try to be like her, actually.\\" In the same documentary, Langenkamp also characterizes Nancy as the \\"good girl\\" whereas the Tina Gray character is contrasted as giving the feeling that \\"she wasn't going to make it.\\" In her documentary I Am Nancy, Heather Langenkamp laments how Freddy Krueger became an iconic character while Nancy Thompson disappeared into the background. To explore why this phenomenon occurred, Langenkamp visits six horror conventions, and tries to discern why the villain became the celebrated figure. After interviewing several attendees, Langenkamp learns that while Nancy Thompson's impact on fans is subtle, she still represents strength and intelligence in the hearts and minds of many. For the advertising campaign, campaign buttons were given out that displayed \\"I am Nancy\\". A Facebook page allowed Nancy fans to share their artwork, photographs, and sentiments about the character. The film won a Best Editing Award at the Amsterdam Film Festival. In addition to interviewing Nancy fans, the documentary also features interviews with Wes Craven, Robert Englund and Jessica Craven (Wes Craven's daughter). Langenkamp learned from Craven that: :\\"I never knew it but now that I‚Äôve talked to him about it, he always thought that Nancy was the centre of his story. It wasn‚Äôt this typical horror movie where you‚Äôre going to kill off everybody. He knew that she was the heart and soul of Nightmare On Elm Street so I think it made a lot of sense for him to bring her back, but I didn‚Äôt know all of this until recently, after conducting my own interviews with him and asking him myself...\\" When developing her documentary, Langenkamp also learned that Nancy Thompson is considered a gay icon. Although Nancy Thompson is heterosexual, Langenkamp shared her theories of why gay and lesbian audience members would be drawn to the character: :\\"I read a lot of these PhD that talk about the final girl, sexuality and sexuality of horror‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre kind of on to something but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre onto the right thing. One theory goes that Nancy is not a particularly feminine hero; she‚Äôs not androgynous but she‚Äôs not scarily beautiful and as a result she can easily identified by both men and women and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the key to her popularity...\\" :\\"I think that people like these movies at a time in their lives when they‚Äôre also understanding who they are sexually so it makes sense that they make connection and they see things in these movies that express who they are...For the gay population out there, I‚Äôm not sure if its just a great movie or there is something to it that gives a gay man or woman a sense of strength maybe...that watching inspirational characters helps you be true to yourself and find the strength you need to do whatever you need to do...\\" See also *Alice Johnson *Final girl References External links  Nancy Thompson at A Nightmare on Elm Street (wiki) * Nancy Thompson at Heroes (wiki) * Nancy Thompson at Horror Film (wiki) Category:A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise) characters Category:Wes Craven characters Category:Fictional psychologists Category:Fictional diarists Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Film characters introduced in 1984 Category:Teenage characters in film Category:Final girls Category:Fictional insomniacs Category:Fictional stalking victims ","title":"Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)"},{"id":"4511538","text":"Geoffrey Patrick Dolan (known as Geoff Dolan) (born 29 December 1964 in Lower Hutt, New Zealand) is a New Zealand actor, singer and corporate entertainer who is probably best known in recent times as recurring character, Derrick/Thor in The Almighty Johnsons.

Due to the rapid growth of Scouting, it took some time for central organisations to be established, and the earliest groups were only registered some time after their first meeting. Some groups first met under the banner of other organisations, including the Boys' Brigade, Church Lads' Brigade, YMCA, churches or schools, and only later registered with central Scout organisations. Some maintained dual registrations. This makes it impossible to establish which groups started first. Today, national Scout associations often do not take a stance as to which was the first group in their country.  Birth of Scouting  There are records of Boy Scouts and Scouting groups from 1900. The Boys' Brigade began its Scouting scheme in 1906. Scouting is usually considered to have started on 1 August 1907 with a camp run by Robert Baden- Powell on Brownsea Island. Thereafter the publishers C. Arthur Pearson Limited and Baden-Powell began promoting Scouting in Britain, and Scouting for Boys was published, initially in six fortnightly installments from January 1908 and then in complete book form. The book was followed by The Scout magazine from April 1908. Boys began forming Scout patrols and flooding the C. Arthur Pearson Limited's Scout office and Baden-Powell with requests for assistance. The Scouting movement developed rapidly from here, in Britain, the British Empire, among English speaking people and the rest of the world.  United Kingdom  1st Glasgow Scout Group, one of the claimants to the title of First Troop The first Scout Patrols and Troops were formed in the United Kingdom in 1907. There are a number of claimants to be the first troop. As Scouting was a movement and not an organisation, there was initially no central organisation. The publishers C. Arthur Pearson Limited sold registration cards to subscribers of its magazine. Numerous local or regional Boy Scouts Associations were formed and several national Scouting organisations were formed in the United Kingdom including the Boys' Brigade Scouts, Chums Scout Patrols, YMCA Boy Scouts, British Boy Scouts, Church Scout Patrols, London Diocesan Boy Scout Corps, Boys' Life Brigade Scouts, National Peace Scouts, The Boy Scouts Association and Salvation Army Boy Scouts (re-organized in 1914 as the Life-Saving Scouts of the Salvation Army). The Boy Scouts Association was formed in 1910 and does not acknowledge any single troop as being the first. Unfortunately, The Boy Scouts Association issued backdated registrations. The Scout Association maintains a list of all the Scout Troops who claim to have started in 1908. The Scout Troops with the strongest claims are listed below: The 1st Glasgow Scout Group in Scotland holds the earliest known registration certificate, dated 26 January 1908, issued by The Boy Scouts Association. The Group was formed from the Glasgow Battalion of the Army Cadet Corps; its Adjutant was Captain Robert E Young. In June 1907, they formed the 'Cadets' Winter Recreation Training Club'. The club was a success from the beginning, as 'Boss' Young related: \\"At first we met at my house, signalled up and down the stairs, tied knots around the banisters and always finished with a good tuck-in.\\" 'Boss' Young met B-P during Autumn 1907 who suggested that the Club could experiment with the ideas contained in 'Scouting for Boys'. On 16 January 1908, the Club was formally disbanded and the First Glasgow Troop of Boy Scouts was registered with Scout HQ in London. The first Scout Troop to receive a visit from Baden-Powell was the Vaux's Own Scout Troop in Sunderland. This visit was made on 22 February 1908, so it is assumed by The Scout Association \\"that it had already been in existence for some days at any rate\\". This was also the first Scout Troop listed in the Imperial records. The 1st Crystal Palace Patrol (now known as the 2nd Croydon, 1st Crystal Palace) is documented as being in existence on 28 February 1908. The group is still in existence. In 2007, 1st Henfield Scout Troop was named as the oldest surviving Scout Troop in the world for the centenary of Scouting. They were the hosts of the only place that the centenary flame stopped in England for the night before reaching its goal of Brownsea Island. However, it is not the oldest Scout Troop, as others were set up before Henfield. It is said that the boys that went to Brownsea Island on the first ever Scout trip were from Henfield. The 1st Birkenhead (YMCA) has a claim to be the oldest Scout Troop as it was founded on 24 January 1908 when B P attended a meeting at the YMCA. Documents at the District Headquarters confirm this fact. Baden- Powell at the 1929 Coming of Age Jamboree in Birkenhead said \\"Here in Birkenhead that I first mooted the idea of Scouting\\". The 1st Croydon Scout Group (Addiscombe) were founded in the latter months of 1907. The Group was officially registered by Imperial Scout Headquarters on 16 June 1908 and can claim to be one of the earliest Groups. 1st Church Kirk, Church near Accrington Lancashire. Formed 1907. Baden Powell formed a link with Accrington during his opening of the Ambulance Drill Hall in 1904. The 1st New Cross (The Greys) Scout Group was formed 17 January 1908 but was not registered until 26 May 1908 by Baden Powell before he even registered his own group.1st New Cross (The Greys) Scout Group There is an entry in Baden-Powell's diary on 4 February 1908 which mentions a Scout Troop in Nottingham. 1st Alsager, Cheshire were formed before 24 February 1908. A troop from Hampstead was involved in various events in the first half of 1908. The 1st City Of Aberdeen Scouts existed in 1908. 1st Arbroath Scout Troop (2nd Angus) dates back to June 1908. 1st Stirlingshire Scouts unofficially first met in August 1908, and later officially on the 21st of December 1908. The 1st Norwich \\"Capt. Bower's Own\\" Sea Scouts started in January 1908. The group is one of few which has continuously run for 100 years and, remarkably, had just 4 Group Scout Leaders during that time. To celebrate their centenary year, the group published a book entitled, \\"It Can Be Done: The Hundred Year History of the 1st Norwich Sea Scout Group.\\" drawing from their extensive archives. The 1st Colchester scout group in Essex (now known as 1st Colchester Air Scouts) were founded in May 1908, the group met in the Bunting Rooms in Culver Street West (Colchester) and Baden Powell made several visits to attend local Scouting rallies. The \\"Air Scout Troop\\" gained official recognition by the Royal Air Force in 1956 and has retained this recognition. https://www.1stcolchesterscoutgroup.com/group-history In Poole, Dorset, there are strong claims from three current Scout Groups that all have separate newspaper articles back to 1908 listing Patrols or Troops practicing Scouting. 1st Parkstone has got a registration number back to February 1908 for a Scout Troop. Hamworthy are listed as having a Boat patrol at the Local Church in November 1908 and Broadstone having an Ambulance Scout at the Gathering on Brownsea Island in December 1908. Wycliffe Scout Group (Gloucestershire) claims to be the oldest continuously active school-based Scout group in the world (active September 2013). It is listed in the Scout Association database with a registration date of 1 February 1909, although the Group celebrated their centenary in 2008, implying that there had been Scouting activity at the school before the Group was registered.  British Empire  1908 Australia Scouting appears to have started as early as 1907 in Victoria in an informal way when a boy in Caulfield received from a friend, who had been a member of the experimental camp at Brownsea Island, some pamphlets which had been issued by Baden-Powell.Victoria Scout Heritage Centre - How Scouting began The first Scout Group in Australia may have been founded in Northcote in Melbourne in early 1908, but the Victoria Scout Heritage Centre states that \\"It is very difficult to name the first Troop to start in Victoria\\".Those Boy Scouts: A Story of Scouting in Victoria, Victorian Scout Archives, 1987 However, by the end of 1908, there were 11 Scout Troops in Victoria. In New South Wales, 1st Toongabbie Scout Group in the western suburbs of Sydney was founded in 1908 by a member of the Sydney University Scouts, Errol Galbraith Knox (later Brigadier Sir Errol Knox, MBE), and is still operating. Canada In the spring of 1908, Canada became the first overseas Dominion with a sanctioned Boy Scout program. The 1st Merrickville Scout Troop, founded in 1908, is the oldest Scout troop in North America. Reference \\"75 Years of Scouting in Canada\\". The 1st Port Morien Group claims to be the first Scout Group in North America. The Nova Scotia Council of Scouts Canada recognized the centennial of the Port Morien Group by providing a crest to all Nova Scotian Scouts Canada members. Gibraltar The first recognized overseas unit in a country controlled by the United Kingdom was chartered in Gibraltar with the establishment of the 1st Gibraltar Scout Troop on 27 March 1908. The group is still active and has a membership of around 140. It is expected to open a new troop and pack this coming year. The group celebrated its 100th anniversary with a parade along Main Street and received the Freedom of the City of Gibraltar on 2 October 2008. To commemorate the conferment of the title Marquis of Milford Haven one hundred years ago, the present marquis visited the Group during the celebrations. Malaysia In Malaysia, the Scout movement started two years after it was founded in London. However, it is believed that a trial group had been established in Penang at YMCA in 1908, the same year that Scouting was formed in England. Malta The Malta Boy Scouts Association applied to become a member of the British Movement on 9 November 1908 and was officially recognised, as was the procedure then, exactly a year later. The 1st Sliema Scout Group in Malta was founded in 1909. South Africa The first Scout Group in South Africa was formed 3 March 1908 at Claremont Public School by George French. It is still running, as 1st Claremont Scout Group, as are several other groups founded in 1908. India The Scout Movement arrived in India in 1909. A troop was formed in Bangalore by a Captain Baker, a retired naval officer. The troop had boys from St. Joseph's, Baldwin's, St. Andrew's, and Bishop Cotton's. The troop was registered with Boy Scout Headquarters in London in November 1909 and, according to records, was the first Scout troop in Asia. Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scout Group was established in 1914, after Rustomji Edulji Sethna (1898‚Äì1954) came across Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys. Sethna was enamoured with the book, and formed India's first Scout group for native boys. (Prior to this, there were some Scout groups, but they were primarily for British expatriate youth.) The group today is India's oldest continually running Scout group. Since its first day on 14 August 1914, the troop remains continuously active. The FIRST DACCA, St. Gregory's Scout Troop. The date on the Approval was 7 May 1914. The Scoutmaster was Mr. Joseph Harnett. The total strength of the Troop was forty boys, as of 27 April 1914. The Britist Official Approval, Dalil lists St. Gregory's as the First Troop in the Dacca or East Bengal area, the Bengal Presidency. The first scouts were David Pogose, Peter Gomes, Alfred Ferguson, Harold Armstead, Cyril Lucas and Osmund D'Silva. The school had Five Patrols and Mr. Francis listed the total number of Scouts as 40,to be going on their first camp in January 1915. Since its first day on 27 April 1914, the troop remains continuously active. Isle of Man The 1st Douglas Scout Group, on the Isle of Man (a Crown Dependency of the UK and not technically part of the UK) was also founded in 1909.  Outside the British Empire  1908‚Äì1910 United States There are numerous troops which claim to be first Boy Scout troop in the United States. Although there appear to be several Boy Scout troops that were operating prior to the establishment of the Boy Scouts of America, none of these claims are deemed verifiable by the organization ‚Äî as far back as 1940 an official, George W. Ehler, searched records and determined ‚ÄúAfter several years of experience with these inquiries and claims, I came to the conclusion that it was not possible from any accepted record to determine which was the first Troop.‚Äù * A claimant for first Boy Scout Troop in the United States is Burnside, Kentucky in 1908. * Bala One is another claimant for first Boy Scout Troop in the United States in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. It was started by Frank H. Sykes prior to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America.Troop Bala One History * A claimant for first Boy Scout troop is Troop #1 of Barre, Vermont in 1909. It was formed in Barre, Vermont, by William Foster Milne, who moved to the United States from Aberdeen, Scotland.name=\\"http://www.aldrich.lib.vt.us/Guide.htm#P16 \\" See Cameron papers, and 1907 Barre City Directory at Aldrich Library :In 1907, William Foster Milne, a stonecutter, immigrated to Barre, Vermont from Aberdeen, Scotland, where he had been active in the early Scouting movement.http://www.timesargus.com/article/20091026/NEWS01/910260350/0/MEDIACENTER He is referred as the \\"First Scoutmaster in America\\" by Sir Francis Vane.http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/resolutn/HCR244.pdf Sir Francis Vane was London Commissioner of Scouts in Baden Powell's organisation and also became President of the British Boy Scouts.Order of World Scouts In 1909, \\"Billy\\" Milne learned of a small group of boys at the First Baptist Church in Barre, who were already members of the Boys Brigade, he offered them an alternative to their routine of marching and drills. By re-organizing into a new \\"Boy Scout Club\\" (Troop #1 in the United States) these Scouts learned first aid, new outdoor skills and being helpful to others. \\"Billy\\" Milne went back to his native Scotland and brought back the books and materials he needed along with a British Charter. By 1910, Barre's Troop #1 joined the Boy Scouts of America. :By March 1910, the Boy Scouts in Vermont had expanded to such a degree that the girls of nearby Thetford became interested. These girls along with William Chauncy Langdon, Dr. Luther Gulick and Charlotte Vedder Gulick formed the Camp Fire Girls which became the sister organization of the Boy Scouts of America on 17 March 1910. The Camp Fire Girls preceded the Girl Scouts of the USA by 2 years. (The Boy Scouts of America has always regarded the Camp Fire Girls - not the Girl Scouts - as its sister organization. Up until the 1970s there were suggestions to merge the BSA and the CFG.) :The original group of boys that made up Troop #1 were Charles Booth, George Booth, Gerald Brock, Carl Burgess, Earl Burgess, Stanton Burgess, Raymond Cave, Clarence Geake, James Grearson, Walter Grearson, Douglas Inglis, Harry Kent, George Murray, Milton Rollins, Craig Rollins, Cecil Watt and Wallace Watt. Dr. Wallace Watt moved to Clinton County, Michigan to attend college and remained there as a Scout leader for his entire life. He received the Silver Beaver Award in 1981 and in 1984 a 75 year Diamond Jubilee service pin from the Boy Scouts of America. Upon his death his widow donated his Barre, Vermont Troop 1 artifacts to the Paine-Gillam-Scott Museum in St. Johns, Michigan.http://www.ci.saint- johns.mi.us/community%20info/2009museum%20opening.pdf :Governor Deane C.

Mitchell. Rev. Mitchell was a missionary priest from England sent to St. Thomas Episcopal Church by the Church of England. Rev. Mitchell, who had been associated in Scout work with Lord Baden-Powell in England, organized the troop of Boy Scouts under English charter and equipped them with English uniforms, manuals, and badges. * On 10 September 1910, S. F. Lester of Troy, New York, became the very first person to hold the Scouting leadership position of Scoutmaster (approved by the BSA). He received his certification from the BSA headquarters in New York City. In 1910 he led a group of 30 Scouts at Camp Ilium, in Pownal, Vermont. Camp Ilium was the starting point of the Boy Scout Movement for Troy, and Pownal. Pownal is only away from Troy. * In 1910, Dan Beard founded Boy Scouts Troop 1 in Flushing, New York, which is believed to be one of the oldest continuously chartered Boy Scout Troop in the United States.http://www.troop1.org/about-us.html * Troop 5 of Denver holds claim to be the oldest continually chartered Boy Scout troop in the United States, west of the Mississippi River, having been chartered continuously since 1910. * In November 1910, Troop #1 of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey received the first charter from the newly organized Boy Scouts of America, with Pastor E.

Some time later on 21 May 1909 the first Scout Camp was held. Norway The first recognized troop in Norway is \\"1. Kristiania (NGSK)\\", established 15 November 1909. This was a troop in Oslo, connected to an athletic organisation. This troop became a part of \\"Norske Gutters Speiderkorps\\", which was established by a national sport organisation. But there were single Scouting patrols earlier than this in some Norwegian cities. China In Shanghai, a troop of \\"Boy Scouts\\" was formed, as a branch of the then existing (British) \\"Boys' Brigade\\" whose members were representative of the cosmopolitan but culturally Western population of the city. The 1st Dragon Troop, run on actual Baden-Powell lines, was also formed in early 1909, in Shanghai. These were mostly British boys. The first native Scout troop was organized by Reverend Yen Chia-lin in Wuchang on 25 February 1912 and the Scouting movement spread rapidly all over the country. 1910 By 1910 Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Suriname,Dagblad Suriname Boy Scouts 84 jaar Sweden and the United States had Boy Scouts too. Finland Toimen Pojat (Unga Fribyggare in Swedish), a Scouting troop in Kauniainen, Finland was established in 1910. Toimen Pojat is the oldest continuously operating Scout troop in Finland. During the Russian ban on Scouting in the 1910s before the Finnish independence in (1917), the troop operated underground. Many traditions that distinguish the troop formed during that period.

Hence the first Boy Scout unit in the Philippines was the YMCA troop organised by Brown. In the official Handbook for Boys of the Boy Scouts of America, First Edition, August 1911 (still in print today!reprints include those of Applewood Books (1997, ), Dover (1969, 2005, , ), Skyhorse () and the Boy Scouts of America), page 354 (page 222 of PDF copy), in a letter from BSA Honorary Vice President Theodore Roosevelt (former US President) to BSA Executive Secretary (laterNovember 1911 Chief Scout Executive) James E. West, dated 20 July 1911, Roosevelt mentions a letter from a Scoutmaster in the Philippines narrating the noble work of \\"boy scouts of the Philippines\\" in rendering assistance during a big fire that hit Manila and in serving at the ten-day Manila Carnival. This is the earliest available documented mention of the phrase \\"boy scouts of the Philippines\\" in print.The organization named Boy Scouts of the Philippines was inaugurated much later, on 1 January 1938. The Manila Scoutmaster's and Roosevelt's letters prove beyond doubt that there were Boy Scouts in the Philippines as early as 1910 - the same year that YMCA International Secretary for Boys' Work Edgar M. Robinson started actively organizing the Boy Scouts of America in the US mainland. Portions of Roosevelt's quote of the Manila Scoutmaster's letter were also printed (before and after the Handbook for Boys edition) in New Castle News (26 May 1911), The Corsicana Daily Sun (31 May 1911), The Washington Post (8 August 1911), The Youngstown Daily Vindicator (23 August 1911), and The Miami Metropolis (20 September 1911). According to The Miami Metropolis article \\"Boy Scouts Work with the Firemen Just Like Heroes\\" on page 3, it was \\"Elwood E. Brown, organizer in the Philippines\\" who had written to Roosevelt.Unfortunately, the Miami News / Miami Metropolis archival site, formerly here, was removed or closed in 2015. Hence citation of this article can no longer be accessed online.Roosevelt's letter has been reproduced in Scouting historian David Scott's book about Roosevelt, We Are Americans, We Are Scouts, 2008, but with Elwood Brown's letter about the Philippine events (rendered irrelevant by Philippine independence in 1946) excised. During his world tour in 1912, Lord Baden-Powell sent back articles for publication in 'The Scout. In issue no. 224, 27 July 1912, in the article \\"In the Cannibal Islands,\\" he made a brief narration about Philippine history and culture and his trip to Manila, illustrated with his own drawings. He mentioned \\"Boy Scouts of the Philippines\\" and that he was met by a \\"Guard of Honour.\\" He also quoted from Roosevelt's letter about the Manila fire and the Manila Carnival in which Scouts rendered valuable service. In the article, Baden-Powell urged readers \\"to get into correspondence with your brother Scouts in Manila‚Ä¶ The Chief Scoutmaster is Mr. Elwood Brown, Y.M.C.A., Manila.\\"The article was reprinted in Chapter 6 of Baden-Powell's compilation Boy Scouts Beyond the Seas: \\"My World Tour\\", 1913, but with BP's date-dependent reference to Brown excised. Boy Scouts Beyond the Seas 1911 Japan The first Boy Scout troop in Japan was organized in Yokohama in 1911 by Clarence Griffin. The boys of the troop were mostly British students of St. Joseph College, a boys' school in the Bluff area of Yokohama, and Clarence Griffin organized the troop under English charter. Clarence Griffin is recognized by the Scout Association of Japan as Japan's first Scoutmaster and is honoured with an inscription as such at his final resting place in the Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery. In 1918 Marianist Bro. Joseph Janning, a missionary teacher of St. Joseph College, assumed the position of Scoutmaster at the school and opened the Troop to boys of all nationalities. The Group subsequently became the first directly registered group of the newly formed Boy Scouts International Bureau, receiving a Charter signed by B-P formally allowing the group to accept \\"Scouts of mixed nationalities\\". The group was registered by the World Scout Bureau as \\"Troop 1, International Boy Scouts\\" and has remained continuously active in Yokohama since its formation. Macao Macao, at the time administered by the Portuguese, saw its first Scout troop founded by Lieutenant √Ålvaro de Melo Machado, the nominated interim governor of the territory. After resigning from the post the following year, Lt. Machado returned to Lisbon, and carried his fostering of scouting to mainland Portugal. 1912 Portugal In the Lisbon area there was at least one documented group started this year, with spotty records pointing to the existence of others around the mainland, all fostered by the Portuguese YMCA (ACM). This first group, along with the one started by Lieutenant √Ålvaro Machado upon his return from Macao, would later (in 1913) join to form the Associa√ß√£o dos Escoteiros de Portugal (AEP), which is active to this day. 1913 Greece In Greece, Mark Mindler established in 1913 the third Sea Scout troop of Athens (3Œ∑ ŒüŒºŒ¨œÇ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ ŒùŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œåœÄœâŒΩ) as the first Scouting group of the country.

However, the cadets were not themselves Scouts. 1918 Mysore State The Chamundi Scout Group was started in December1918 by its founder M.H.R.(Mallasandra Hanumantharao Ramachandrarao) (05/05/1899-18/01/1982). as the first Open Group to be started in India & the then called Mysore State. 1918 is a year of Historical importance since the 1914-1918 war breathing a sigh of relief. The Boy Scout Movement was then taking its roots in the state. The Group consisted of Scout Section only when it was formed. A cub pack was added in 1924 and it became complete in 1924 when a rover crew was started. When S.R.Nanjundaiah's Hindu A.V School which was in a private building at Sultanpet, got accommodation at the Govt.Middle School,Siddikutte (Seegebeli) the Troop started its activities in the school compound. Later the group moved its operations to Naranarayana Choultry at the Market Square in Old Police Road. In course group secured A roon Tippu Sultan palace with the help of Sri. Subba Rao, the then Organising Commissioner, The Boy Scouts of Mysore. It was here troop had all the facilities for scouting group committee was formed with Late Ananda Rao Sirsi, the then Municipal President, who was succeeded by Sri.K.Chandy, the Revenue Commissioner who later became the member of council, Sri Belvadi Ramaswamiah, Revenue Commissioner,Rao Sahib Channaiah, District Judge, Sri.N.Madhava Rao, chief secretary to government later became the 23rd Deewan of Mysore, Dr.Subba Rao, senior surgeon, Sri.D.V.Gundappa,Sri.K.Shankarnarayana Rao, Major Y.V.K Murthy, Dr.V.K.Badami Etc. Shri.K.Netkallapa continued to be one of the Vice Presidents. The group had branches in Old Sringeri Mutt,Chamrajpet, Shankar Puram. In order to cater to the needs of the units \\"Siddikutte\\" Local Association was formed and later merged with \\"City Local Association\\" to extend its activities.The group leader was the Secretary in the year 1928 this association was merged with \\"City District Association\\" one of our Vice-Presidents Major Y.V.K Murthy became the District Scout Commissioner and one of the parents Dr. Gopakrishna Rao became the Secretary. =Royal patronage= The group has the proud legacy of being adopted as the Maharaja's Own Troop after winning the All India First Aid Mace at the All India competitions held at Nandi Hills in 1924. M.H.R. was Baloo for sometime to the Prince Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. On a special invitation in 1931 the group and its members including parents and we'll wishers attend a Hi-Tea party at the Bangalore Palace hosted by H.H the chief Scout Sri Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar and H.H chief cub Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. The wheel of the group had rolled from place to place in the first fifty years. One must recollect how the Scout group was tossed from place to place before establishing its land in November 1941 on the solid rock it stands today with the efforts of Late.M.R.Narsimha Iyengar Group Scout Master and Secretary of the Group Committee. There was no den until the year 1957 with the sincere effort of Bros. V.Rangaswamy and M.Nagaraj the group put up a small den. The group has been successfully running now for 99 years and looks forward to a whole new approach to 21st century of scouting. The group is led by Bro. K.Narasimha Murthy and with more than 80 kids meeting & doing scouting 365 days has been a dream come true of our founder M.H.R.

Formed from Interactive Development Environments, Inc. and Thomson Software Products, it was called Aonix from 1996 until 2010. It was acquired by PTC in 2014. History The company might be considered an example of the \\"merger mania\\" of the 1990s and beyond. Aonix was formed in November 1996 by merging two software development tools companies: Interactive Development Environments, a modelling, analysis and design tools developer, and Thomson Software Products (TSP). TSP was based in Norwalk, Connecticut with engineering and support facilities in Norwalk and San Diego, California. TSP was established in July 1995, as a United States subsidiary of the French firm Thomson-CSF, formed by merging the Thomson subsidiary Alsys of San Diego with Must Software International of Norwalk. The staff in Norwalk continued to provide client/server fourth-generation language (4GL) and middleware products, while the ex-Alsys worked on high-performance Ada programming language development environments and the TeleUSE family of graphical user interface development tools. In December, 1998, Aonix was acquired by private equity firm The Gores Group (then known as Gores Technology Group). Aonix owned the product lines Nomad software, Ultraquest and Select Solution Factory until two groups split in January 2003 in a management buy-out. The new company, based in Boulder, Colorado and still owned by Gores, was named Select Business Solutions. Aonix merged with real-time and embedded Java tools vendor NewMonics, of Tucson, Arizona in 2003, acquiring the PERC product line. In January 2010, Aonix and Artisan Software Tools (based in Cheltenham, UK) agreed to merge, forming a new company called Atego. The combined company was headquartered in San Diego. In March 2010 Atego acquired BlueRiver Software, the Germany-based maker of the X32PTC X32plus C/C++ interactive development environment. In 2011 it acquired the ApexAdaPTC ApexAda family of Ada compilers from the Rational Software division of IBM. PTC, Inc. announced on July 1, 2014, it acquired Atego, for approximately $50 million in cash. Product lines included AdaWorld, Ameos, Architecture Component Development, ObjectAda (now PTC ObjectAda), PERC (now PTC Perc), RAVEN, SmartKernel, Software Through Pictures, and TeleUSE (now PTC TeleUSE).

However, some specificities exist. Portugal has the highest rate of rural population in Western Europe, which means that roughly a third of the Portuguese families live in farms or properties outside urban areas. Another characteristic is that most of the urban population is actually suburban. The metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto each have over 2 million inhabitants. In these areas, families live in apartment blocs, each apartment usually having two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and one or two bathrooms. Most properties have been built since the 1970s, and especially since the turn of the millennium. This caused historical areas of Lisbon, Porto and other cities to become depopulated, though the younger generations now have a growing interest on buying and repairing these old buildings. The trendy district of Bairro Alto, in Lisbon, is an example of this. Portuguese traditional architecture is quite similar to others of the Mediterranean, and whether a traditional country house or a suburban apartment bloc, Portuguese buildings and towns will look like those in Italy or Spain. This apart from the specificities of Portuguese architecture and its traditions, also excluding high rise projects inspired by the English Post-War tradition, the Socialist Bloc tradition and nowadays modern trends. Another strange, but somewhat common sight in Portugal, are the Swiss-like chalets, built by Portuguese people who lived in Switzerland or Germany. However, in recent years, traditional architecture is more popular. Over two thirds of all Portuguese property is owned by the resident. House renting is more common in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Aveiro, all of these cities having many students and foreign residents. Other areas where apartments are usually rented are sea resorts and the Algarve, this last region having many British, Irish, Dutch, German and French residents. As of 2006, it costs around 500‚Ç¨ to rent a T1 (one bedroom and a living room) apartment in Lisbon, and 90.000‚Ç¨ to buy the same house. These prices force young couples and families to live in suburbs like Amadora, Odivelas or Almada, where housing is cheaper. However, luxury housing is an important market in Portugal, especially in the larger cities, as well as in Algarve, Cascais and the South Bank of the Tejo. All of the real estate market in Portugal is still recovering from a crisis, which means there are many empty houses in the suburbs, as well as construction firms in financial trouble. There are more houses in Portugal than the total population of 10 million individuals, since half of the Portuguese families own a country or holiday house, as well as many Europeans who choose to regularly spend their holidays in this Southern European country. Large projects of holiday housing featuring private beaches and golf resorts are very common in the South of the country. Typologies Real estate industry in Portugal usually divides housing units in two classes: apartments (apartamento or andar) and separate houses (vivenda or moradia). The apartments are classified in types T0, T1, T2, etc., that define the number of separate bedrooms. So a T0 means a studio apartment (no separate bedrooms, with bedroom and sitting room combined in the same single room), while a T2 means an apartment with two separate bedrooms (plus a living room). Usually, T0 apartments have a kitchenette while T1 and above apartments usually have a kitchen as a separate room. When an apartment has additional small bedrooms (only allowing a single bed and/or without window), the quantity of these rooms appear in the typology after a \\"+\\" (e.g. T1+1, means an apartment with a normal bedroom plus a small bedroom). Separate houses are analogously classified, with a \\"V\\" prefix replacing the \\"T\\". So, a house with a living room and two bedrooms would be classified as V2. The typologies with higher and lower number of housing units are respectively the T3 and the T1. By the order of percentages, the typologies are: T3 (22,5%), T2 (20,6%), T4 (9,3%), T5 (8,9%), T1 (6,2%) and T0 (1,0%).Housing and Building Statistics in Portugal, Statistics Portugal References Category:Economy of Portugal Category:Portuguese society Category:Real estate in Portugal ","title":"Housing in Portugal"},{"id":"4511581","text":"Scavas 1 (1973) Scavas 2 (1992) Scavas is the name of sports cars designed by Greek engineer Vassilios Scavas that were never industrially produced.

A single model is usually developed to predict the behavior of propagation for all similar links under similar constraints. Created with the goal of formalizing the way radio waves are propagated from one place to another, such models typically predict the path loss along a link or the effective coverage area of a transmitter. Characteristics As the path loss encountered along any radio link serves as the dominant factor for characterization of propagation for the link, radio propagation models typically focus on realization of the path loss with the auxiliary task of predicting the area of coverage for a transmitter or modeling the distribution of signals over different regions Because each individual telecommunication link has to encounter different terrain, path, obstructions, atmospheric conditions and other phenomena, it is intractable to formulate the exact loss for all telecommunication systems in a single mathematical equation. As a result, different models exist for different types of radio links under different conditions. The models rely on computing the median path loss for a link under a certain probability that the considered conditions will occur. Development methodology Radio propagation models are empirical in nature, which means, they are developed based on large collections of data collected for the specific scenario. For any model, the collection of data has to be sufficiently large to provide enough likeliness (or enough scope) to all kind of situations that can happen in that specific scenario. Like all empirical models, radio propagation models do not point out the exact behavior of a link, rather, they predict the most likely behavior the link may exhibit under the specified conditions. Variations Different models have been developed to meet the needs of realizing the propagation behavior in different conditions. Types of models for radio propagation include: Models for free space attenuation  * Free-space path loss * Dipole field strength in free space * Friis transmission equation Models for outdoor attenuation *Terrain models **ITU terrain model **Egli model **Two-ray ground-reflection model *City models **Okumura model **Hata model for urban areas **Hata model for suburban areas **Hata model for open areas **COST Hata model  Models for indoor attenuation  *ITU model for indoor attenuation *Log-distance path loss model  Software  * Propagation Modeling Website (PMW) * ITS Radio Propagation Software  See also  * Computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere * Radio propagation * Channel model * Fading * Link budget * Mobility model * Nakagami fading * Traffic generation model * Radio resource management References Category:Radio frequency propagation ","title":"Radio propagation model"},{"id":"4511637","text":"The Brigade Mixte Mobile (BMM) is the paramilitary secret police of Cameroon.

History This methodology for continuous perfection of production, industrial technologies, organizational structures was developed by Juryj Sobolev (–°–æ–±–æ–ª–µ–≤, –Æ—Ä–∏–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á) (Russia) in 1948 at the \\"Perm telephone factory\\" (Almost at the same time as L.

Today in economically developed countries practically each enterprise or the company use methodology of the kind of functional-cost analysis as a practice of the quality management, most full satisfying to principles of standards of series ISO 9000. Basic ideas * Interest of consumer not in products itself, but the advantage which it will receive from its usage. * The consumer aspires to reduce his expenses (cost or price of functions). * Functions needed by consumer can be executed in the various ways, and, hence, with various efficiency and expenses. Among possible alternatives of realization of functions exist such in which the parity of quality and the price is the optimal for the consumer. Method The goal of FCA is achievement of the highest consumer satisfaction of production at simultaneous decrease in all kinds of industrial expenses (production costs). Classical FCA has three English synonyms - Value Engineering, Value Management, Value Analysis.

The Faroe Islands' avifauna consists of about 110 species of bird, including vagrants. During the last 150 years, over 260 species have been recorded. There are about 40 common breeding birds, including the seabirds fulmar (600,000 pairs), puffin (550,000 pairs), storm petrel (250,000 pairs), black-legged kittiwake (230,000 pairs), guillemot (175,000 pairs), Manx shearwater (25,000 pairs). Symbolically, the most important of the birds of the Faroe Islands is the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). Their annual arrival on about 12 March is celebrated by the Faroe Islanders as the start of spring. For this reason, the tjaldur (pronounced ), is recognised as the national bird of the Faroes. However, in numbers, the avifauna is dominated by an estimated two million pairs of breeding seabirds of several species. There are also some resident landbirds and many regular visitors, both passage migrants and breeders, as well as several species recorded occasionally as vagrants, mainly from Europe. The Faroese postal system, the Postverk F√∏roya, prints stamps portraying Faroe birds. See external links. History In the 19th century, the islands were occasionally visited by black-browed albatross; one bird regularly summering with gannets for 34 years before it was shot for the Natural History Museum in Copenhagen. The great auk also visited the Faroes and may have bred there, but became extinct throughout its range in the North Atlantic in the early 19th century due to human predation. The pied raven, a colour morph of the common raven, also occurred but disappeared by the middle of the 20th century. Historically, harvesting seabirds for food was an important source of nutrition for the islanders. A reduced and strictly regulated harvest, mainly of fulmars and puffins, continues. In general, the seabirds and their nesting areas are now strongly protected. List of birds The most common birds are listed with their Faroese names too.

In organisms that naturally have teeth, it is the result of tooth loss. Organisms that never possessed teeth can also be described as edentulous, such as members of the former zoological classification order of Edentata, which included anteaters and sloths, all of which possess no anterior teeth and either no or poorly developed posterior teeth. In naturally dentate species, edentulism is more than just the simple presence or absence of teeth; it is biochemically complex, because the teeth, jaws, and oral mucosa are not static objects; they are dynamic (changing over time). Processes such as bone remodeling (loss and gain of bone tissue) in the jaws and inflammation of soft tissue in response to the oral microbiota are clinically important for edentulous people. For example, bone resorption in the jaw is frequently how the teeth were able to detach in the first place; the jaw in an edentulous area undergoes further resorption even after the teeth are gone; and insertion of dental implants can elicit new bone formation, leading to osseointegration. Meanwhile, bacteria and yeasts of the oral cavity and the immune system of their host create an immensely complicated and constantly changing interplay that presents clinically as gingivitis, caries, stomatitis, and other periodontal pathology. Signs and symptoms For people, the relevance and functionality of teeth can be easily taken for granted, but a closer examination of their considerable significance will demonstrate how they are actually very important. Among other things, teeth serve to: *support the lips and cheeks, providing for a fuller, more aesthetically pleasing appearance *maintain an individual's vertical dimension of occlusion *along with the tongue and lips, allow for the proper pronunciation of various sounds *preserve and maintain the height of the alveolar ridge *cut, grind, and otherwise chew food Tooth loss also has a psychological impact: it has been shown to generally lower a patient's quality of life, with this compromised oral function leading to decreased self-esteem and a decline is psychological well-being. Patients may be embarrassed to smile, eat and talk. In conclusion, tooth loss has a vast impact on general and psychological health. So Dental practitioners should do their utmost to prevent it through prevention, education and finally treatment. Facial support and aesthetics When an individual's mouth is at rest, the teeth in the opposing jaws are nearly touching; there is what is referred to as a \\"freeway space\\" of roughly 2‚Äì3 mm. However, this distance is partially maintained as a result of the teeth limiting any further closure past the point of maximum intercuspidation. When there are no teeth present in the mouth, the natural vertical dimension of occlusion is lost and the mouth has a tendency to overclose. This causes the cheeks to exhibit a \\"sunken-in\\" appearance and wrinkle lines to form at the commissures. Additionally, the anterior teeth, when present, serve to properly support the lips and provide for certain aesthetic features, such as an acute nasiolabial angle. Loss of muscle tone and skin elasticity due to old age, when most individuals begin to experience edentulism, tend to further exacerbate this condition. The tongue, which consists of a very dynamic group of muscles, tends to fill the space it is allowed, and in the absence of teeth, will broaden out. This makes it initially difficult to fabricate both complete dentures and removable partial dentures for patients exhibiting complete and partial edentulism, respectively; however, once the space is \\"taken back\\" by the prosthetic teeth, the tongue will return to a narrower body. Vertical dimension of occlusion As stated, the position of maximal closure in the presence of teeth is referred to as maximum intercuspidation, and the vertical jaw relationship in this position is referred to as the vertical dimension of occlusion. With the loss of teeth, there is a decrease in this vertical dimension, as the mouth is allowed to overclose when there are no teeth present to block further upward movement of the mandible towards the maxilla. This may contribute, as explained above, to a sunken-in appearance of the cheeks, because there is now \\"too much\\" cheek than is needed to extend from the maxilla to the mandible when in an overclosed position. If this situation is left untreated for many years, the muscles and tendons of the mandible and the TMJ may manifest with altered tone and elasticity. Pronunciation The teeth play a major role in speech. Some letter sounds require the lips and/or tongue to make contact with teeth for proper pronunciation of the sound, and lack of teeth will obviously affect the way in which an edentulous individual can pronounce these sounds. For example, the consonant sounds of the English language s, z, j, and x are achieved with tooth-to-tooth contact; d, n, l, t, and th are achieved with tongue-to-tooth contact; the fricatives f and v are achieved through lip-to-tooth contact. These sounds are very difficult to properly enunciate for the edentulous individual. Preservation of alveolar ridge height faciolingual dimensions of a newly edentulous ridge, while the blue line indicates these dimensions after the occurrence of very severe resorption. The alveolar ridges are columns of bone that surround and anchor the teeth and run the entire length, mesiodistally, of both the maxillary and mandibular dental arches. The alveolar bone is unique in that it exists for the sake of the teeth that it retains; when the teeth are absent, the bone slowly resorbs. The maxilla resorbs in a superioposterior direction, and the mandible resorbs in an inferioanterior direction, thus eventually converting an individual's occlusal scheme from a Class I to a Class III. Loss of teeth alters the form of the alveolar bone in 91% of cases. In addition to this resorption of bone in the vertical and anterioposterior dimensions, the alveolus also resorbs faciolingually, thus diminishing the width of the ridge. What initially began as a sort of tall, broad, bell curve-shaped ridge (in the faciolingual dimension) eventually becomes a short, narrow, stumpy sort of what doesn't even appear to be a ridge. Resorption is exacerbated by pressure on the bone; thus, long-term complete denture wearers will experience more drastic reductions to their ridges that non-denture wearers. Those individuals who do wear dentures can decrease the amount of bone loss by retaining some tooth roots in the form of overdenture abutments or have implants placed. Note that the depiction above shows a very excessive change and that this many take many years of denture wear to achieve. Ridge resorption may also alter the form of the ridges to less predictable shapes, such as bulbous ridges with undercuts or even sharp, thin, knife-edged ridges, depending of which of many possible factors influenced the resorption. Bone loss with missing teeth, partials and complete dentures is progressive. According to Wolff's law, bone is stimulated, strengthened and continually renewed directly by a tooth or an implant. Teeth and implants provide this direct stimulation which develops stronger bone around them. A 1970 research study of 1012 patients by Jozewicz showed denture wearers had a significantly higher rate of bone loss. Tallgren's 25-year study in 1972 also showed denture wearers have continued bone loss over the years. The biting force on the gum tissue irritates the bone and it melts away with a decrease in volume and density. Carlsson's 1967 study showed a dramatic bone loss during the first year after a tooth extraction which continues over the years, even without a denture or partial on it. Effects on jawline and facial structure due to complete edentulism The longer people are missing teeth, wear dentures or partials, the less bone they have in their jaws. This may result in decreased ability to chew food well, a decreased quality of life, social insecurity and decreasing esthetics because of a collapsing of the lower third of their face. The bone loss also results in a significant decrease in chewing force, prompting many denture and partial wearers to avoid certain kinds of food. Food collecting under the appliance takes their enjoyment out of eating so they make their grocery and restaurant choices by what they can eat. There are several reports that correlate the quality and length of peoples lives with their ability to chew. Dental implant studies from 1977 by Branemark and countless others show dental implants stop this progressive loss and stabilize the bone over the long term. Implanted teeth provide a stable, effective tooth replacement that feels natural. They also provide an improved ability to chew comfortably and for those missing many teeth an improved sense of well being. Dental implants have become the standard for replacing missing teeth in dentistry. Masticatory efficiency Physiologically, teeth provide for greater chewing ability. They allow us to masticate food thoroughly, increasing the surface area necessary to allow for the enzymes present in the saliva, as well as in the stomach and intestines, to digest our food. Chewing also allows food to be prepared into small boli that are more readily swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. For those who are even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. When an individual loses enough posterior teeth to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of their anterior teeth to chew. If enough posterior teeth are missing, this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their occlusion; posterior teeth, in a mutually protected occlusion, help to protect the anterior teeth and the vertical dimension of occlusion and, when missing, the anterior teeth begin to bear a greater amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. Thus, loss of posterior teeth will cause the anterior teeth to splay. This can be prevented by obtaining dental prostheses, such as removable partial dentures, bridges or implant-supported crowns. In addition to reestablishing a protected occlusion, these prostheses can greatly improve one's chewing abilities. As a consequence of a lack of certain nutrition due to altered eating habits, various health problems can occur, from the mild to the extreme. Lack of certain vitamins (A, E and C) and low levels of riboflavin and thiamin can produce a variety of conditions, ranging from constipation, weight loss, arthritis and rheumatism. There are more serious conditions such as heart disease and Parkinson's disease and even to the extreme, certain types of Cancer. Treatments include changing approaches to eating such as cutting food in advance to make eating easier and less likely to avoid as well as consumer health products such as multivitamins and multi- minerals specifically designed to support the nutritional issues experienced by denture wearers. Numerous studies linking edentulism with instances of disease and medical conditions have been reported. In a cross-sectional study, Hamasha and others found significant differences between edentulous and dentate individuals with respect to rates of atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and joint disease. Cause Edentulism is a condition which can have multiple causes. In exceedingly rare cases, toothlessness may result from the teeth not developing in the first place (anodontia).Jahangiri, L., Choi, M., Moghadam, M. and Jawad, S. (2015). Interventions for missing teeth: Removable prostheses for the edentulous mandible. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, (2). However, in most cases it is as a result of permanent tooth extraction in adulthood. This may or may not be due to dental caries, periodontal disease (gum disease), trauma or other pathology of the face and mouth (i.e. cysts, tumours). In those under 45 years of age, dental caries is considered to be the main cause of toothlessness, whereas periodontal disease is the primary cause of tooth loss in older age groups.Papapanou, P. N. Periodontal diseases: epidemiology. Annals of periodontology/the American Academy of Periodontology 1, 1‚Äì36, doi: 10.1902/annals.1996.1.1.1 (1996).  Replacing missing teeth  There are three main ways in which missing teeth can be replaced: *Bridges: Used to replace 1 or a few missing teeth. False teeth are supported by the remaining, adjacent natural teeth. **Advantages: ***They are fixed, they do not require removal on a frequent basis. Therefore, they are easily maintained. ***Can be cleaned by normal brushing procedures. ***Unlike dentures, they do not require skill in their use. They will not move about. **Disadvantages: ***They generally require the preparation of adjacent teeth. This is destructive, and not required for the placement of a denture. ***They have a higher rate of failure than either Dentures or Implants. *Dentures: False teeth are mounted onto an acrylic base. These may be partial (to replace some missing teeth) or complete (where all the natural teeth are missing). Dentures may be removable, or fixed in the mouth by dental implants. **Advantages: ***This is the least expensive option for the replacement of teeth. ***The least invasive, no surgery needed (usually). **Disadvantages: ***Quite often rely solely on the mucosa for support, do not tend to be as stable as the other options. ***Very difficult to keep clean and can exacerbate any oral hygiene issues. ***They are difficult to learn to use. Quite often require complex muscular control to hold them in place. ***Not as efficient as other options. Foods such as apples and nuts will often have to be avoided. * Dental Implants: To replace a single tooth, a screw (the implant) is placed into the jaw bone, onto which a false tooth is screwed onto. Implants can also be used to support bridges or dentures. **Advantages: ***They are much more realistic than the other options. Have similar efficiency and aesthetics to an actual tooth. ***They do not require the destruction of the adjacent teeth like bridges. ***These last 5-8 times longer than both bridges and dentures. Despite the initial higher cost, it pays off in the long term. ***Much easier to maintain, with oral hygiene procedures being rather similar to an actual tooth. **Disadvantages: ***Cost: they are very expensive. A single implant will cost between ¬£2000-3000 on average. ***Surgery: Their placement requires quite invasive surgery. With surgery comes risks (e.g. infection, swelling, bleeding). ***Replacement: The actual implant itself rarely requires replacement, but the actual abutment, or tooth sitting on top of the implant will. This needs replacing on average every 10‚Äì15 years. ***Time: Once an implant has been placed, the tooth replacement does not occur immediately. Implants take time for bone integration. The majority require 3 to 6 months before the final restoration is placed. Clinical classification A classification system has been developed by the American College of Prosthodontists. The classification are based on diagnostic findings, which is used to help practitioners determine appropriate treatments for patients. The diagnostic criteria used to classify edentulism are: * Location and extent of the edentulous areas * Condition of abutment teeth * Occlusal scheme * Residual ridge There are four categories which are Class I, II, III and IV. * Class I: Minimally compromised This class is most likely to be successfully treated with complete dentures. The characteristics include: * Residual bone height of 21mm or more measured at the lowest vertical height of the mandible shown on a panoramic radiograph. * Residual ridge morphology resists horizontal and vertical movement of the denture base * Location of muscle attachments that arc conducive to denture base stability and retention * Class I maxillomandibular relationship. * Class II: Moderately compromised This class is distinguished by the continued degradation of the denture‚Äêsupporting anatomy. It is also characterised by specific patient management and lifestyle considerations as well as systemic disease interactions. Characteristics include: * Residual bone height of 16 to 20mrn measured at the lowest vertical height of the mandible on a panoramic radiograph. * Residual ridge morphology that does not show horizontal and vertical movement of the denture base. * Location of muscle attachments with limited influence on denture base stability and retention. * Class I maxillomandibular relationship. * Minor modifiers, psychosocial considerations, mild systemic disease with oral manifestaion. * Class III: Substantially compromised This classification level is where surgical revision of supporting structures is needed to allow for adequate prosthodontic function. * Residual alveolar bone height of 11 to 15mm measured at the least vertical height of the mandible on a panoramic radiograph. * Residual ridge morphology has minimum influence to resist horizontal or vertical movement of the denture base. * Location of muscle attachments with moderate influence on denture base stability and retention. * Class I, II or III maxillomandibular relationship. The conditions that need preprosthetic surgery include: # minor soft tissue procedures # minor hard tissue procedures including alveoloplasty # simple implant placement, no augmentation required # multiple extractions leading to complete edentulism for immediate denture placement. * Class IV: Severely compromised This classification level depicts the most debilitated edentulous condition. Surgical reconstruction is al- most always indicated but cannot always be accom- plished because of the patient's health, preferences, dental history, and financial considerations. When surgical revision is not an option, prosthodontic techniques of a specialized nature must be used to achieve an adequate treatment outcome. * Residual vertical bone height of 10mm or less measured at the least vertical height of the man- dible on a panoramic radiograph. * Residual ridge offers no resistance to horizontal or vertical movement. * Muscle attachment location that can be expected to have significant influence on denture base stability and retention. * Class I, II, or III maxillomandibular relationships. * History of paresthesia or dysesthesia. Major conditions requiring preprosthetic surgery # complex implant placement, augmentation required # surgical correction of dentofacial deformities # hard tissue augmentation required # major soft tissue revision required, i.e., vestibular extensions with or without soft tissue grafting. Epidemiology Disability-adjusted life year for edentulism per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Edentulism affects approximately 158 million people globally as of 2010 (2.3% of the population). It is more common in women at 2.7% compared to the male rate of 1.9%. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from 14 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) and Israel showed substantial variation in the age- standardized mean numbers of natural teeth amongst people aged 50 years and older, ranging from 14.3 teeth (Estonia) to 24.5 teeth (Sweden). The oral health goal of retaining at least 20 teeth at age 80 years was achieved by 25% of the population or less in most countries. A target concerning edentulism (‚â§15% in population aged 65‚Äì74 years) was reached in Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, France, and Germany. Tooth replacement practices varied especially for a number of up to five missing teeth which were more likely to be replaced in Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland than in Israel, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, and Sweden. The prevalence of Kennedy Class III partial denture was predominant among younger population of 21-30 year and 31‚Äì40 years, whereas in group III between 41 and 50 years Class I was predominant. It can be stated that the need for prosthodontics care is expected to increase with age, and hence, more efforts should be made for improving dental education and motivation among patients. Edentulism occurs more often in people from the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. Society and culture It is estimated that tooth loss results in worldwide productivity losses in the size of about US$63 billion yearly.

Designed by Erik Palmstedt, the palace was originally the private residence of Princess Sophia Albertina. It was built 1783-1794 and declared a historical monument (byggnadsminne) in 1935 and subsequently restored by Ivar Tengbom in 1948-52. Since 1906 the palace has served as the seat of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The palace is facing the square Gustav Adolfs torg, with the Royal Swedish Opera on the opposite side. Located near the palace are the Sager Palace, official residence of the Prime Minister, and Rosenbad, official office of the government. The bridge Norrbro stretches past the Riksdag on Helgeandsholmen and further south to Stockholm Old Town and the Royal Palace.  History  Lennart Torstensson (1603‚Äì51), a successful general, bought the area west of the square and had his palace built there 1646-51. The main entrance of this building was facing Fredsgatan, the street passing north of the site, while the southern part of the site was still occupied by one-story wooden structures. This was a German-Dutch Renaissance palace in brick in a style widely favoured all over Europe at this time. One of the rooms from this era is still preserved; the former kitchen now serving as the office of the Chief of Protocol. Lennart's son Anders, governor of Estland, made unsuccessful attempts to sell the property to save his economy, and the palace was subsequently taken over by the Crown in 1696 but eventually given back to Torstensson's heir.Nilsson, Kulturv√§rden, 2001:1. King Gustav III's sister Princess Sophia Albertina bought the property in 1793. The king, who wished to give his sister a residence in accordance to her station, commissioned architect Erik Palmstedt to create a new palace which should include the old and adopt the plans for the area north of the Royal Palace.Government of Sweden The architect not only had to create a copy of the building on the opposite side of the square, he was also ordered to ensure the old Renaissance palace would be included into the new, a demand which reflects Gustav III's passion for Gustavus Adolphus and his era. While Sophia Albertina, before her death in 1829, had the palace bequeathed to the Swedish heir presumptive (i.e. the hereditary prince), it was during the ensuing decades used by court officials and as offices for various authorities, a faith which would eventually prevail. Before Oscar II became king in 1872, he and his wife Sofia used the palace as their residence, where their son, Gustav V, and other members of the royal family, including Prince Eug√©n, spent parts of their childhood. The ministry for Foreign Affairs moved there in 1906, but had to share the building with several other authorities until 1936. A comprehensive restoration was made 1948‚Äì1952, which among other things resulted in the addition of a building on the courtyard.  Exterior  The surroundings of Arvfurstens palats as seen from Stockholm Palace (2011) During the era of the Swedish Empire, Gustav Adolfs torg, the square in front of the palace, was developed into one of the most prominent public spaces in Sweden. It is centred on the equestrian of Gustavus Adolphus by Pierre Hubert L'Archev√™ques. This project was based on Tessin the Younger's plans for the rebuilt Royal Palace and its immediate surroundings. East of the square, a new opera building was erected in 1782 (demolished in 1892) and the fa√ßade on the western side was designed as a copy of the former, echoing its pilasters and the columns of the accentuated central portion. The entire setting was inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris.M√•rtelius, Guide till stockholms arkitektur, p 17. And like in the French capital, several other aristocrat residences were built in the surrounding area. Some of the grand visions Tessin developed were carried through with the construction of the bridge Norrbro, even though the centrepiece in his plans, a royal church on the northern side of the square, remained a dream. A large Renaissance sandstone portico from the original Torestensson Palace on the northern side, was restored in the 20th century, and its present appearance thus reflects the original design of Diedrich Blume from 1647.Statens fastighetsverk, Arvfurstens palats, Stockholm. An identical portico is still found on the courtyard.  Interior  Matsalen (\\"Dining Room\\") or Stora konferensrummet (\\"Great Conference Room\\") was originally divided into three separate rooms during Torstensson, but these were united into a single space in the mid-18th century and are since then used for official dinners and conferences. On the walls hang the portraits of past Minister for Foreign Affairs and a large portrait of Axel Oxenstierna. Stora salongen (\\"Great Salon\\") or Bl√• salongen (\\"Blue Salon\\") is a salon designed by the Louis Masreliez in a style called Late Gustavian. This, the central and largest room in the piano nobile, was used as an archive during WWII and was at the time in a bad shape. It has since been restored and is today used for official receptions. It has cut- glass chandeliers, two sandstone stoves, and textiles in the original blue and white colours. It also features the busts of Gustav III and his sister Sophia Albertina by Johan Tobias Sergel, as well as four sculptures donated by the Italian government. In Audiensrummet (the \\"Audience Room\\"), because of the red textiles also called R√∂da salongen (the \\"Red Salon\\"), Sophia Albertina used to receive her guest sitting in a gilded throne under a baldachin, the prominence of the scene underlined by the royal coat of arms topped by a princess crown over the four doors. Today it serves as the office room of the Minister's press secretary and his/her staff. The preserved wood carvings were executed by Gottlieb Iwersson, one of the most distinguished furniture designers of the late 18th century, with ornaments carved by Jean Baptiste Masreliez, Louis Masreliez's brother. During the era of Sophia Albertina, S√§llskapsrummet (the \\"Drawing Room\\") served a salon where she and her courtiers could spend hours conversing and embroidering. The wall frameworks by Louis Masreliez featuring nymphs, cupids, and muses, were once surrounding the embroideries produced by the princess and her court, but are today replaced by wallpapers with painted flowers. Since the ministry took position of the palace this room serves the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the room are two 17th century desks by Gottlieb Iwerson and Georg Haupt, the latter featuring an ornamental inkstand originally intended to be a gift to Marie Antoinette. Arbetsrummet (the \\"Study\\") originally served as the princess' bedroom and later as her waiting room. Today it is the office of the Under-secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (kabinettsekreterare). Many of the furnitures in the room date back the Princess' era and are still found on their original locations, as are the painting Belshazzar's Banquet and the Rococo cabinet featuring with the Swedish Coat of Arms in bronze.

She was the stepdaughter of Mark Antony and half-sister of his sons Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Iullus Antonius. Biography She had one full sibling from her parents; Publius Clodius Pulcher Minor, and three half-brothers from her mother Fulvia; Gaius Scribonius Curio, Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Iullus Antonius. Mark Antony was her mother's third husband. As Clodius had done previously, Antony was happy to accept Fulvia's money to boost his career. Following Julius Caesar's assassination on March 15, 44 BC, Antony formed the second triumvirate with Octavian and Lepidus and embarked on a savage proscription. To solidify the political alliance, Fulvia offered Clodia to young Octavian as wife, while Lepidus offered his wife's niece Servilia (daughter of Junia Prima and Publius Servilius Isauricus).Dr Kirsty Corrigan; Brutus: Caesar's Assassin - page: 128 Subsequently, Octavian chose Clodia. Not much is known about their marriage and little information survives about Clodia. These actions caused political and social unrest, but when Octavian asked for a divorce from Clodia, Fulvia herself decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, her brother-in- law, she raised eight legions in Italy to fight for Antonius' rights against Octavian, in what became the Perusine War. The army occupied Rome for a short time, but eventually retreated to Perusia (modern Perugia). Octavian besieged Fulvia and Lucius Antonius in the winter of 41-40 BC, starving them into surrender. Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon, where she died of a sudden illness. Octavian divorced Clodia to marry Scribonia, with whom he would have his only child, Julia the Elder. His marriage with Clodia was never consummated: in a letter to her mother he stated that she was still a virgin.Suetonius, Augustus 62. 1; Cassius Dio, Roman History 48. 5. 3.

The film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Thomas Reilly, a businessman recruited by the souls of four deceased people, his guardian angels from childhood, to help them rectify their unfinished lives, as he is the only one who can communicate with them. Plot In San Francisco, 1959, four despondent strangers embark on the same night trolleybus: Penny, a single mother, regrets working the night shift and leaving her three children at home; Harrison, a would-be singer, has backed out of an important audition due to stage fright; Julia leaves her waitressing job to seek out her boyfriend John, whose marriage proposal she rejected; and small-time thief Milo has just failed to retrieve a book of valuable stamps that he had conned out of a young boy. Their driver is Hal, who becomes distracted by an attractive passenger in another car and accidentally swerves the trolleybus off of an overpass, killing everyone aboard. At the same time, Frank Reilly is driving his pregnant wife Eva to the hospital. Frank avoids the trolleybus just before it crashes. The Reillys are safe, but Eva delivers their baby in the car. Hal ascends into the next life, but the souls of the four passengers are \\"attached\\" to the newborn baby, Thomas, for reasons they do not understand. Only Thomas can see and hear them, and they are forced to follow him wherever he goes. As the years pass, the four grow to love Thomas, and he loves them. As Thomas grows older, however, his parents worry about his obsession with these \\"invisible people\\" and consider having him committed. Realizing their presence is hurting Thomas, the quartet decides to become invisible to him as well. The perceived abandonment causes young Thomas to avoid close relationships for the rest of his life, fearful that they, too, will leave him. Thirty-four years later, Hal returns with his trolleybus. Because his irresponsibility ended four innocent lives, Hal has been condemned to convey spirits to the next life, and he has now come for his former passengers. The quartet learns that they've been with Thomas all these years because each of them died with unfinished business: Penny never found out what happened to her children, Harrison never conquered his fears and fulfilled his dream of public singing, Julia never told John her true feelings, and Milo never returned the stamp album, which would have freed him of the guilt from his life of crime. Thomas was meant to serve as their corporeal form, helping them to resolve their final business; if he refused to help, they were to inhabit his body and use it to solve their problems. After convincing Hal to buy some more time for them to rectify their unfinished lives, they reappear to Thomas, now a ruthless foreclosure banker who refuses to open up to his devoted girlfriend Anne. Thomas, who has since undergone psychotherapy to convince himself that his \\"imaginary friends\\" were only a childhood delusion, initially believes their reappearance means he has had a psychotic break. Ignoring their pleas, he attempts to check himself into a psychiatric hospital, where a schizophrenic patient is able to describe the spirits that accompany him. This convinces Thomas that the spirits are real, but he is still angry with them for their abandonment and refuses to help them. The quartet convince him by leaping in and out of his body during an important meeting and threatening further public humiliation until Thomas reluctantly agrees to help in order to finally be rid of them. Thomas is able to locate Penny's two daughters, but not her youngest child Billy, who was adopted after Penny's death. Milo uses Thomas's body to break into a house, steal back the stamp album, and return it to its now-adult owner. However, after the burglary, a nervous Thomas encounters a police sergeant (who is ticketing his illegally parked car) and accidentally gets himself arrested, forcing Anne to bail him out. Harrison uses Thomas's body to sing the national anthem at a B.B. King concert, after which Thomas is arrested again by the same police sergeant, who Penny suddenly recognizes as her son. Thomas tells Billy the location of his long-lost sisters, and Billy is so overcome that he lets Thomas go with a warning. Meanwhile, Anne, concerned with Thomas's recent bizarre behavior, demands to know what's going on. When he is unable to tell her, she breaks up with him. Finally, Thomas and Julia write a letter to Julia's boyfriend John in which she confesses her love for him, only to learn from a man now living in what was John's house, that John died several years before. At the same moment, the trolleybus returns to take Julia. Thomas protests that Julia's business is still unresolved, but Julia realizes that her true business is Thomas, who is making the same mistake with Anne that she made with John. Thomas promises her that he will tell Anne his true feelings before it is too late, allowing Julia to depart. Thomas invites Anne back to the arboretum, where he admits his fear of abandonment and his love for her. As a symbol of his trust, he gives her a heart-shaped keyring containing all his personal keys. Anne forgives him. The two dance under the night sky where four new stars twinkle to show that Penny, Julia, Harrison, and Milo are finally at peace.

The Court proposed what is known as the Handy test for determining whether past occurrences that resemble the crime can be admitted as evidence. Background The complainant went out drinking with her friends and met James Handy whom she had known for several months. They went home together and what began as consensual sex became violent. Handy was charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm. The Crown tried to introduce evidence of Handy's history with his ex-wife which involved seven past sexual assaults on her. The trial judge allowed it. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether Handy's history of violence with his ex- wife is admissible as evidence. Ruling of the Court Justice Binnie, writing for the Court, used this case to restate the approach to similar fact evidence. He stated that a \\"principled approach\\" must be used where the probative value must be weighed against the prejudicial effect. When examining probative value several factors must be considered. First, the court must examine the strength of the evidence in showing that the past events actually occurred. The credibility of the witness must be considered and if there is any motive to lie must have an effect. Second, the court must consider whether there was any potential of collusion between the witness and the claimant. If there was merely an opportunity to collude then the question is left to the jury, otherwise if there is \\"some evidence of collusion\\" then the onus is on the Crown to show on the balance of probabilities that no collusion occurred. Third, the court must consider the scope of the issue in question. If it is a very broad issue, then the threshold for probative value will be very high. If it concerns a material issue in the trial, then it should be looked upon favourably. Fourth, the court must consider whether the evidence supports the inference that the Crown is attempting to draw. This involves examining the similarities between the events. Factors include: * the proximity in time between the events * the extent to which the other events are factually similar * the number of occurrences of the similar events * the circumstances surrounding the events * the distinctiveness of the events * the existence of any intervening events Next Binnie considered what prejudicial effects should be considered. He divided it into moral prejudice and reasoning prejudice. The moral prejudice includes evidence that will cause the jury to think that the accused is a bad person. This is particularly where the past events were acts that were more reprehensible than the current facts. The reasoning prejudice includes evidence that present a risk of distraction, confusion, and evidence that will consume too much time. Using this test Binnie found that the evidence put forward by the Crown was inadmissible.

He is best known for working as director on the Studio Ghibli film The Cat Returns. History Morita was born in Fukuoka Prefecture and graduated from Fukuoka Kenritsu Chikushikoto School. During his high school days, he produced an independent animated film called , which won a prize in an animation magazine contest at the time. One of the production staff members for the film was Katsuyuki Toda, who later became a manga artist. After graduating from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Fukuoka University, he joined the animation production company Shaft. His first work as an animator was Hiatari Ry≈çk≈ç!. Afterwards, he became a freelancer and worked as an inbetweener on movies such as Akira and Kiki's Delivery Service, a key animator for Roujin Z, Hashire Melos!, Memories, Perfect Blue and many others, and an episode director for the OVA Golden Boy. Being an animator who cares about fundamentals, Morita even danced the choreography for the idols in Perfect Blue. Other Studio Ghibli productions he has worked on include My Neighbors the Yamadas and Koro no Daisanpo, a short film for the Ghibli Museum. This led to him being selected to direct The Cat Returns. In 2007, he directed his first TV series, Bokurano: Ours. On February 27, 2011, he was elected as director for the Japanese Animation Creators Association. He retired in June 2015 after serving on the board of directors for approximately four years. Until mid-2017, he worked at Polygon Pictures, a digital animation production company, and was involved in the management of ACTF, a forum themed around digital animation. He is currently working as a freelancer. Controversy During the production of the anime adaptation of Bokurano, Morita posted progress reports and held Q&A; sessions about the aired episodes on his blog. There were various comments from the viewers such as criticism, support and inquiries. On the same blog, Morita stated, \\"I dislike the original work, and I admit that I made some malicious changes to the original when making it into an animation.\\"Hiroyuki Morita's blog; June 13, 2007 In response to this, not only did viewers criticize the adaptation of Bokurano, but many also criticized Morita himself. Later, Morita explained, \\"The word 'dislike' that I used towards the original work was misleading so I'll correct myself. The original manga is good and full of mysteries, and I think it was worth adapting. I wrote that I 'disliked' the original story simply because there was so much mystery there, and because of the hardships involved. I was wrong to easily blame my personal 'dislike' and 'malice' for the criticisms written about the quality of my work. There is no escaping the fact that we have our own interpretation of the greatest mystery of all: why do the children die.\\" In a Monthly Ikki magazine interview with the original author Mohiro Kitoh, Morita said, \\"I was half-forced to say [that I 'dislike' it],\\" to which Kitoh replied, \\"I'm sure you were (laughs)\\" and \\"On the contrary, you've shown some good stuff (laughs).\\" Filmography TV Anime *Hiatari Ry≈çk≈ç!

Founded in 1958 by the Hungarian-born entrepreneur and electronics engineer Peter Munk with furniture designer David Gilmour, the company established an international reputation for stereo and cabinetry design in the 1960s. It had failed little more than a decade later, but in its heyday it made a notable contribution to the field of consumer electronics. Already in 1959, Clairtone won a design award from Canada's National Industrial Design Council for its very first hi-fi model, the \\"100-S\\"‚Äîa long, low teak cabinet fitted with a Dual 1004 turntable, a Granco tube chassis, and speakers obscured by cream- colored broadcloth from Knoll. But the most famous Clairtone design was the futuristic Project G series designed by Hugh Spencer and introduced at the National Furniture Show in Chicago in January 1964. Striking, massive (nearly seven-feet long), and expensive ($1,600, or about $12,000 today), the Project G featured an rosewood cabinet mounted on a metal base, and, at either end, cantilevered black aluminum \\"sound globes\\" (a.k.a. speakers). The Project G introduced the now-standard modular approach to consumer audioCivilization.ca: Cool '60s Design: Canadian design to remember that offered a dramatic departure from boxy cabinet design popular until that time (and which Clairtone also manufactured).

Clairtone earned a reputation for combining modern designs with high-quality materials, and marketing them well. It opened its first international sales office in New York in 1960 and convinced Frank Sinatra and Oscar Peterson, among others luminaries, to endorse Clairtone's sound systems. \\"Listen to Sinatra on Clairtone stereo. Sinatra does,\\" was one of the company's memorable tag lines. The Project G system was featured in the films Marriage on the Rocks and The Graduate, marking an early example of product placement, and Clairtone hired the fashion photographer Irving Penn to photograph the hi-fi for its promotional booklets and brochures. The Project G came to epitomize the ethos of the Swinging Sixties when Hugh Hefner bought one for the Playboy Mansion.Book Review: \\"Design In Canada Since 1945: Fifty Years From Teakettles To Task Chairs\\" , Deirdre Hanna in Now Toronto Online Edition, December 2001. In 1963, Clairtone began traded publicly on the Toronto Stock Exchange. At its peak, demand for Clairtone's stereos in Canada and the U.S. was so great that for a time the company's factory stayed open around the clock. But even as sales soared and it was winning awards for its innovative designs, Clairtone was facing insurmountable financial troubles. In 1963, it earned a profit of $300,000 on sales of $10 million, and profits decreased the following year as marketing costs rose higher than sales.Hopkins Early investor Frank Sobey, who had been mayor of Stellarton, Nova Scotia from 1937 to 1959 and was then president of Industrial Estates Limited (IEL), helped the company obtain financial support from the Government of Nova Scotia to open an electronics manufacturing plant in Stellarton. The company decided to switch production to televisions at this time and was fully operational in Stellarton by the summer of 1966. There were close to 1,000 employees at the time. Clairtone launched its new G-TV television set with its usual flair, hiring the cinematographer Fritz Spiess to direct a TV advertisement that starred Peter Munk and David Gilmour driving a 1936 Pierce-Arrow convertible across the Brooklyn Bridge‚Äîwith a Clairtone TV set in the back seat (the ad, titled \\"New York,\\" can be found on YouTube today). But Clairtone's entry into the colour television market was ill-timed (the market would not take off for another five years; see History of Television). Sales were exceedingly poor, with annual losses in 1967 of more than $6 million, and the business began to spiral out of control. In October, 1967, Industrial Estates Limited, an economic development agency of the Government of Nova Scotia, took over control of the company from Peter Munk and David Gilmour. Sales continued to decline and the share price plunged from more than $15 in 1967 to a few cents by 1970.Roy George A confidential study commissioned by Clairtone in 1967 found that the failure of the plant was in part due to the local workforce: \\"The general population is basically not geared to the manufacturing frenzy and especially the five-day workweek... The welfare situation is such that it has created conditions similar to Appalachia in the United States where the third generation is already on relief.\\" But, as reported by Peter Munk's daughter, the financial journalist Nina Munk, in her 2008 book about Clairtone (The Art of Clairtone: The Making of a Design Icon, 1958-1971), the labour force in Stellarton was only one of many problems: \\"Nothing went smoothly, from all accounts. Cost controls were 'nonexistent,' according to the commissioned study. Roads leading to the factory were so bad that Clairtone's stereos and TVs were often damaged en route. Getting parts for the stereos, a task that at the old plant in Rexdale, Ontario, could be organized in a single day, took several weeks. As for the manufacturing process itself, Clairtone's inexperienced management team was over its head, and sinking: inventory went missing; unidentified parts accumulated on the factory floor; the assembly line seldom if ever ran at full speed or full capacity.\\" By March 1970, Clairtone was sold to the Government of Nova Scotia and came under new management. At this time it began to offer cheaper products including the world's smallest transistor radio, the \\"Mini Hi-Fi\\".Transistor.org: Clairtone \\"Mini Hi-Fi\\" by Sarah Lowrey, 2001WJOE Radio: Taking radio from the past into the new Millenniumradiomuseum.org- Clairtone Sound Corporation The company hemorrhaged money to the amount of $19 million that year, losses that were absorbed by the province. Clairtone's stock was de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1971, and the company finally closed in 1972. The assets were sold but the company was not officially dissolved until 1979. Over the period of its investment the Government of Nova Scotia lost approximately $25 million, considerably more in today's money. Sinclair Micromatic. Notes Further reading * Roy E.

Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction, most notably as places which human beings might colonize, as resources for extracting minerals, as a hazard encountered by spaceships traveling between two other points, and as a threat to life on Earth due to potential impacts.  Overview  When the theme of interplanetary colonization first entered science fiction, the Asteroid Belt was quite low on the list of desirable real estate, far behind such planets as Mars and Venus (often conceived as a kind of paradise planet, until probes in the 1960s revealed the appalling temperatures and conditions under its clouds). Thus, in many stories and books the Asteroid Belt, if not a positive hazard, is still a rarely visited backwater in a colonized Solar System. The prospects of colonizing the Solar System planets dimmed as they became known to be not very hospitable to life. However, the asteroids came to be imagined as a vast accumulation of mineral wealth, accessible in conditions of minimal gravity, and supplementing Earth's presumably dwindling resources‚Äîthough the value of such minerals would have to be very high indeed to make such enterprises economically viable. Stories of asteroid mining multiplied after the late 1940s, accompanied by descriptions of a society living in caves or domes on asteroids, or (unscientifically) providing the asteroid with an atmosphere held in place by an \\"artificial gravity\\". The idea of such isolated settlements, coupled with existing stereotypes of American mineral prospectors in the 19th century \\"Wild West\\", gave rise to the stock character of a \\"Belter\\" or \\"Rock Rat\\" ‚Äì a rugged and independent-minded individual, resentful of state or corporate authority. Among such works is Ben Bova's Asteroid Wars series. Another way in which asteroids could be considered a source of danger is by depicting them as a hazard to navigation, especially threatening to ships traveling from Earth to the outer parts of the Solar System and thus needing to pass the Asteroid Belt (or make a time- and fuel-consuming detour around it). In this context, asteroids serve the same role in space travel stories as reefs and underwater rocks in the older genre of seafaring adventure stories. And like such hazards, asteroids could also be used by bold outlaws to avoid pursuit. Representations of the Asteroid Belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks, so dense that adventurous measures must be taken to avoid an impact, giving dramatic visual images which the true nearly empty space would not provide. One of the best-known examples of this is the Hoth system in The Empire Strikes Back. In reality asteroids, even in the asteroid belt, are spaced extremely far apart. Proto-planets in the process of formation and planetary rings may look like that, but the Sun's asteroid belt does not. (The asteroid belt in the HD 69830 system may, however.) The asteroids are spread over such a high volume that it would be highly improbable even to pass close to a random asteroid. For example, the numerous space probes sent to the outer solar system, just across the main asteroid belt, have never had any problems, and asteroid rendezvous missions have elaborate targeting procedures. The movie 2001: A Space Odyssey is unusual in that it does portray realistically the ship's \\"encounter\\" with a lone asteroid pair. A common depiction of asteroids and comets in fiction is as a threat, whose impact on Earth could result with incalculable damage and loss of life. This has a basis in scientific hypotheses regarding such impacts in the distant past as responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs and other past catastrophes ‚Äîthough, as they seem to occur within tens of millions of years of each other, there is no special reason (other than creating a dramatic story line) to expect a new such impact at any close millennium. In earlier works, asteroids provided grist for theories as to their origin ‚Äì specifically, the theory that the asteroids are remnants of an exploded planet. This naturally leads to SF plot-lines dealing with the possibility that the planet had been inhabited, and if so ‚Äì that the inhabitants caused its destruction themselves, by war or gross environmental mismanagement. A further extension is from the past of the existing asteroids to the possible future destruction of Earth or other planets and their rendering into new asteroids.  Early examples  The earliest explicit references to asteroids date from the late nineteenth century:An illustration from 's novel Off On a Comet (, 1877) drawn by . * ' (Off on a Comet, 1877), novel by Jules Verne. A Victorian vision of touring the solar system via handy \\"comet Gallia\\", the comet captures the \\"recently discovered asteroid Nerina\\" as it traverses the asteroid belt. Nerina was fictional at the time, but 1318 Nerina would be discovered and named by Cyril V. Jackson nearly sixty years later. * Edison's Conquest of Mars (1898), serial by Garrett P. Serviss. A fleet of spaceships from Earth on its way to attack Mars halts at an asteroid that is being mined for gold by the Martians. * ' (The Chase of the Golden Meteor, 1908), by and . This posthumously published novel was extensively edited and modified by his son . The attribution of plot elements between father and son was long debated, until Verne's original version was unearthed. The book begins with the rivalry between two amateur astronomers who both claim discovery of a new asteroid. Originally an in-crowd issue among astronomers, it becomes a major worldwide problem when it is found that the asteroid is about to fall on Earth (to be exact, in Greenland). One of The Adventures of Tintin has a similar premise: The Shooting Star. Unlike later asteroid books, the main problem is not the damage which its fall may cause, but the fact that it is made of solid gold, which could upset the economy of the world. Thus, the asteroid's eventual fall into the Atlantic and its disappearance beneath the waves is presented as a satisfactory aversion of the economic danger, and there are none of the huge and highly destructive tsunami which in later stories (and in reality) would have followed.Jacques Crovisier Fred Hoyle's Element 79 (1967) exploits essentially the same plot device: an asteroid with significant amount of gold wreaks havoc with the Earth's economy. * The Valley of Fear (1914), short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Professor Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes's arch-enemy, \\"is the celebrated author of 'The Dynamics of an Asteroid' , a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it\\" Though the Holmes stories were published at the same time as those by H. G. Wells, Holmes regards astronomical studies as an issue of pure abstract science, which would never have practical applications or provide the scene of future adventures. * \\"Asterite Invaders\\" (1932‚Äì33), a storyline in the Buck Rogers comic strip, featuring miniature humanoids living on the asteroids. * ' (The Little Prince, 1943), novel by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. The title character lives on an asteroid named \\"B-612\\". He then travels among various asteroids, each inhabited by a single person: a lamplighter, a king, a businessman, a geographer, and so on. Saint-Exup√©ry made no effort at scientific accuracy, since he was mainly writing social and political commentary and satire. (For example, his reference to \\"Baobab trees which, if not uprooted in time, might take root and break an asteroid to pieces\\" is commonly understood as an allegory of Fascism). The asteroid moon was named after the character, and after his asteroid.  Real asteroids in fiction  Although the asteroids are commonly dealt with en masse, a few belt asteroids have become known well enough to be mentioned in fictional treatments. Ceres Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest and first discovered planetoid of the main-belt asteroids. Eros After Ceres, Asteroid 433 Eros is perhaps the most-commonly mentioned asteroid, probably because it is one of the largest near-Earth asteroids. * ‚ÄúOur Distant Cousins‚Äù (1929), short story by Lord Dunsany. An enterprising aviator flies to Mars, but ends up on Eros on his return trip due to a navigation error. Everything on Eros is tiny due to its small size and gravity; the aviator brings a tiny elephant back to Earth in a matchbox, but it escapes.Lord Dunsany, ‚ÄúOur Distant Cousins,‚Äù The Saturday Evening Post, November 23, 1929; collected in In the Land of Time and Other Fantasy Tales, S.

Eros turns out to be a disguised alien spaceship. * Men into Space (1960), TV tie-in novel by Murray Leinster. The First Martian Expedition, commanded by Col. Ed McCauley, lands on Eros to refuel en route to Mars. * Space Angel (1962‚Äì64), Cambria Productions TV series. In the episode \\"The Visitor from Outer Space\\", Scott McCloud and his crew are forced to destroy Eros by deflecting it into the Sun, when it becomes a hazard to spaceship navigation. * Captive Universe (1969), novel by Harry Harrison. Eros has been converted into a vast hollow generation ship, the interior of which provides the setting for the story. * \\"Let Us Save the Universe (An Open Letter from Ijon Tichy)\\" (1971), a short satirical story by Stanis≈Çaw Lem, published usually within The Star Diaries collection. A letter purportedly written by Ijon Tichy criticizing widespread vandalism done by space tourists describes Eros as one of the most vandalized asteroids, being strewn with graffiti, such as initials of loving couples, petty poetry, hearts pierced by arrows etc. * Ender's Game (1985), novel by Orson Scott Card. Eros was formerly an outpost for the aliens known as Formics who installed artificial gravity, but was taken over by humans; a Command School was built there. This is where Ender was sent after he graduated from Battle School. * Vacuum Flowers (1987), a novel by Michael Swanwick, is set partly in \\"Eros Kluster\\", a slum of jerry-rigged space stations orbiting 433 Eros. * Asteroid (1997), NBC's two-part miniseries features a series of asteroids heading towards Earth. Eros, the larger of the two asteroids, is shattered into small fragments by the Air Force's ABL in an attempt to divert it from a certain impact on Earth. Eros still proceeds to rain over Dallas, Texas. * Justice League of America #26 (February 1999) by DC Comics. The JLA uses Eros as an inescapable prison for their unkillable foe, The General. He is simply deposited on the asteroid's flatter end. He later escapes with the aid of alien forces. * Evolution (2003), novel by Stephen Baxter. Eros plays an important role in the future evolution of life on Earth. Millions of years after being perturbed into a new orbit, the asteroid collides with Earth, bringing about a mass extinction. The micrometeoroid- ravaged shell of NEAR Shoemaker still stands on the surface of Eros until seconds before the impact. * Leviathan Wakes (2011), first novel of book series by James S. A. Corey. Supporting \\"a population of one and a half million\\", Eros is \\"a port of call in the first generation of humanity's expansion\\" into the outer solar system and is the setting for a large part of this science fiction series opener. ** The Expanse (2015‚Äì ), TV series (SyFy network, 2015‚Äì2018; Prime Video since 2019) adapted from Leviathan Wakes (above) and its sequels. Icarus Asteroid 1566 Icarus, best known for its close approach to Earth and the Sun, has been the subject of multiple fictional works, such as: * \\"Nebo Zovyot\\" (\\"The Sky Beckons\\", 1959), a Soviet science-fiction film, depicts an emergency landing and cosmonauts walking on Icarus as it passes Mars. * \\"Summertime on Icarus\\" (aka \\"Icarus Ascending\\", 1960), short story by Arthur C. Clarke. An astronaut is stranded on Icarus as it approaches perihelion. * Alley Oop, newspaper comic strip. During Icarus' 1968 passage the character Doc Wonmug electrostatically deflects it away from a collision with Earth. * Icarus's Way (a.k.a. The Trip of Icarus) (1974), novel by Lyuben Dilov. Icarus is equipped with engines and turned into a large spaceship travelling for generations through the Universe. * In the Ocean of Night (1977), novel by Gregory Benford. An asteroid named Icarus plays a major role. * Lucifer's Hammer (1977), novel by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The 1968 passing of Icarus is mentioned several times. However, the actual impactor is a comet, perturbed by a passage of the hypothetical dwarf star Nemesis. * The Memory of Whiteness (1985), novel by Kim Stanley Robinson. Icarus is inhabited by a religious cult that worships its close approaches to the Sun. Juno Asteroid 3 Juno is one of the largest belt asteroids, the second-most-massive stony S-type. * Mobile Suit Gundam (1979), a Real Robot anime directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino. The asteroid Juno, renamed Luna 2, has been placed into Lunar orbit, opposite the moon for the purpose of supplying materials for space colony construction. It is later retrofitted into a military base for the Earth Federation. * Eon (1985), science fiction novel by Greg Bear. Juno appears as a hollowed out asteroid/starship from the future, called the Thistledown. * The title character of the song \\"The Lean Green Vegetable Fiend (From 'Tuther Side Of The Moon)\\" by Nervous Norvus hails \\"from Juno, on the other side of the moon-o\\". * In the Sailor Moon metaseries (1995), a subset of villains called the \\"Amazoness Quartet\\" appear in the fourth arc of the manga and its anime counterpart, Sailor Moon SuperS. One of them is called JunJun who is later revealed to be a Sailor Senshi named Sailor Juno. Pallas Asteroid 2 Pallas is the third-largest belt asteroid. * \\"Palladian Space Pirates\\" (1936), a storyline in the Buck Rogers comic strip. * Seetee Shock (1949) and Seetee Ship (1951), novels by Jack Williamson in which many smaller asteroids are made of \\"contraterrene\\" or \\"seetee\\" matter, an early fictional name for antimatter. Pallas is made of normal matter and is the seat of government for the \\"Mandate\\" which oppressively governs the Asteroid Belt. * Pallas (1993), book 1 in L. Neil Smith's science fiction- fantasy series, Ngu Family Saga. Emerson Ngu, a boy who lives in a dystopian socialist commune in a crater on the terraformed asteroid Pallas, creates a crystal radio and is astonished to learn of the world outside the commune. Escaping, he discovers that the rest of Pallas is a libertarian utopia. Unable to forget his semi-enslaved family‚Äîwhose \\"workers' paradise\\" is starving to death‚Äîhe innovates a cheap but durable gun (because the Libertarians on Pallas, to their shame, did not have a domestic firearms industry), and sets about liberating his former commune. The book was partly inspired by Jared Diamond's article, \\"The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race\\" (1987). The book also includes a brief description of a way to encapsulate the entire surface of a small body, such as an asteroid, to enable the creation of an Earth-like environment. * Captain Future magazine, Winter 1942 (\\"Quest Beyond the Stars\\"), featured a version of Pallas known as the \\"Pirates' Planet\\". * \\"The Shrinking Spaceman\\", episode of Space Patrol (1962), puppet television series.

Common themes  Collisions with planets A common depiction of asteroids (and less often, of comets) in fiction is as a threat, whose impact on Earth could result with incalculable damage and loss of life. This scenario is based on such past events as the impact event responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. Such events are, however, sufficiently rare that there is no special reason to expect such an impact in the near future. * The Year 4338: Petersburg Letters, an 1835 novel by Vladimir Odoevsky, is set in 4338, a year before Biela's Comet was to collide with the Earth as computed in the 1820s; although in reality the comet burned up later in the nineteenth century. * \\"The Wandering Asteroid\\", episode of Space Patrol (1962), puppet television series.

Colonization When the theme of interplanetary colonization first entered SF, the Asteroid Belt was quite low on the list of desirable real estate, far behind such planets as Mars and Venus (often conceived as a kind of paradise planet, until probes in the 1960s revealed uninhabitable temperatures with a deadly carbon dioxide and sulfur atmosphere under its clouds). Thus, in many stories and books the Asteroid Belt, if not a positive hazard, is still a rarely visited backwater in a colonized Solar System. * Seetee Shock (1949) and Seetee Ship (1951), novels by Jack Williamson featured terraformed and antimatter asteroids. * \\"Dumb Martian\\" (1952), short story by John Wyndham. A ruthless Earth man buys a young Martian woman (Martians, in this story, being a humanoid race subject to Earth-human colonialism and exploitation). She is to serve as a companion in his five-year lonely tour of duty on an asteroid orbiting Jupiter. In the power struggle between the two of them, isolated on the asteroid, the arrogant and chauvinistic Earth man finds that his \\"Dumb Martian\\" is not as dumb as he thought she was. * Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (1953), juvenile novel by Isaac Asimov. The Asteroid Belt is the haunt of dangerous pirates. The hero, an agent of The Terran Empire, has not only his job but also a private score to settle with pirates who had killed his parents. In the end, however, the enlightened Empire gives former Pirate strongholds in terraformed asteroids a chance to stay on as law-abiding communities.Review of Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids in Jenkins‚Äô Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov * \\"The Lonely\\" (1959), episode of The Twilight Zone, television series. A convict, serving a 40-year sentence in exile on an asteroid, is clandestinely given a robot woman as a companion. * \\"Island in the Sky\\" (Uncle $crooge #29, Mar. 1960), comic by Carl Barks. Scrooge McDuck scouted the asteroid belt to find a safe location for his money. The story depicts the asteroid belt as being much denser than it actually is. There are also many very large asteroids, some having atmospheres and inhabitants. At least one is a virtual paradise, replete with lush vegetation including bananas, papayas, apples, nuts, wild rice and melons. * \\"The Small Planets\\" (ca. 1960‚Äì62), episode of Gumby animation. Gumby searches for an asteroid to settle, but finds each one already inhabited by a reclusive and unfriendly child. * Raiders From The Rings (1962) by Alan E. Nourse * X-Men, comic book. The villain Magneto has used an asteroid called Asteroid M (X-Men #5, May 1964) as his base of operations, complete with an observation deck, hangar bays and medical facilities, using technology to conceal it from standard detection technology. * \\"Tales of the Flying Mountains\\" (1970), short stories first published 1962‚Äì65 by Poul Anderson. Collection of short stories on the colonization of the asteroids. * Protector (1973), novel, and other short stories by Larry Niven. These stories explore the psychology of the \\"Belters\\", people born and raised in asteroid colonies. A similar society in the \\"Serpent Swarm\\" of asteroids in the Alpha Centauri system, are featured in some stories of the Man-Kzin Wars series. * Gundam, anime and novel series by Yoshiyuki Tomino. Asteroids are utilized for a variety of purposes. In Mobile Suit Gundam (1979), Several asteroids have been moved from the asteroid belt to positions in Earth's Lagrange points. The most prominent of these are Solomon and A Baoa Qu, major space fortresses of the Principality of Zeon. Juno, formerly a mining asteroid, is renamed Luna II and moved to the L3 Lagrangian point opposite to the Moon. It becomes the Earth Federation's main space military base during and after the story. . Solomon and A Baoa Qu eventually fall into the Federation's hands, and are renamed Konpei Island and Gate of Zedan, respectively. In Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (1985), Axis is a former asteroid mining colony that has become the stronghold of the Axis Zeon faction. Originally located in the asteroid belt, Axis is equipped with thermonuclear pulse thrusters in order to travel to Earth. Axis arrives in the Earth Sphere late in the Gryps Conflict, and the alliances Axis forms drastically alter the balance of power. * The Venus Belt (1981), novel in the North American Confederation series by L. Neil Smith. A social system of total free enterprise on asteroids. * Ender's Game (1985) and Ender's Shadow novels by Orson Scott Card. The Asteroid Belt is mainly a military zone, housing the bases and institutions dedicated to the war against Earth's insectoid invaders. A major part of both books takes place at Command School on 433 Eros where gifted children are kept in complete isolation and ruthlessly turned into tough fleet commanders, losing their childhood in the process. * The Way (1985‚Äì1996), series of novels by Greg Bear. There is a colony inside a hollowed-out asteroid. * Blue Mars (1996), novel by Kim Stanley Robinson, and 2312, set in the same background: The colonization of asteroids and how new technology affects their development. * Futurama (1999‚Äì2003, 2008‚Äì2013). Humans have inhabited asteroids with single homes in the asteroid belt. * Asteroid Wars (2001‚Äì2007), novels by Ben Bova. Warfare by corporations for control of the asteroid belt. * The Expanse, a novel series, and The Expanse, a television show, where humanity has colonized Ceres and several other asteroids. * The 100 (2014‚Äìpresent), a television series about space. Asteroid colonies have been mentioned. Fifth planet Before colonization of the asteroids became an attractive possibility, a main interest in them was theories as to their origin ‚Äì specifically, the theory that the asteroids are remnants of an exploded planet. This naturally leads to SF plot lines dealing with the possibility that the planet had been inhabited, and if so ‚Äì that the inhabitants caused its destruction themselves, by war or gross environmental mismanagement. A further extension is from the past of the existing asteroids to the possible future destruction of Earth or other planets and their rendering into new asteroids. For a list of \\"fifth planets\\" in fiction, see Fictional planets of the Solar System Mineral extraction The prospects of colonizing the Solar System planets became more dim with increasing discoveries about conditions on them. Conversely, the potential value of the asteroids increased, as a vast accumulation of mineral wealth, accessible in conditions of minimal gravity, and supplementing Earth's dwindling resources. Stories of asteroid mining became more and more numerous since the late 1940s, with the next logical step being depictions of a society on terraformed asteroids ‚Äî in some cases dug under the surface, in others having dome colonies and in still others provided with an atmosphere which is kept in place by an artificial gravity. An image developed and was carried from writer to writer, of \\"Belters\\" or \\"Rock Rats\\" as rugged and independent-minded individuals, resentful of all authority (in some books and stories of the military and political power of Earth-bound nation states, in others of the corporate power of huge companies). As such, this subgenre proved naturally attractive to writers with Libertarian tendencies. Moreover, depictions of the Asteroid Belt as The New Frontier clearly draw (sometimes explicitly) on the considerable literature of the Nineteenth-Century Frontier and the Wild West. And since (in nearly all stories) the asteroids are completely lifeless until the arrival of the humans, it is a New Frontier completely free of the moral taint of the brutal dispossession of the Native Americans in the original. * Seetee Ship (1951) and Seetee Shock (1949) by Jack Williamson. Earth, Mars, Venus and the Jovian Moons are all dominated by competing tyrannical political systems (a Communist one, a Fascist one, and a Capitalist \\"democracy\\" totally dominated by a single vast, all-owning and all-controlling corporation). The scattered, despised and numerically inferior asteroid miners are left as the sole remaining champions of individual liberty. The \\"Rock Rats\\" neatly turn the tables by finding out how to produce energy from the collision of matter and anti-matter asteroids (anti-matter or \\"Contraterrene\\" is the \\"Seetee\\" (C-T) of the title). Virtually unlimited energy is broadcast from the Asteroid Belt all over the Solar System, for everybody to tap and use completely free of charge ‚Äî and all the oppressive systems go crashing down. * Beyond Mars (1952‚Äì1955), comic strip in The New York Sunday News by Jack Williamson. Loosely based on the novel Seetee Ship. * \\"Catch That Rabbit\\", short story by Isaac Asimov in the collection I, Robot (1950). A lonely asteroid mining station is the location for an intractable robot mystery and tangle. * The Rolling Stones (1952), novel by Robert A. Heinlein. The family Stone travels to the Asteroid Belt, where the twins of the family hope to sell food and luxury items to the miners extracting radioactive ores. * Rip Foster Rides the Gray Planet (1952), young adult novel by Harold L. Goodwin under the pseudonym Blake Savage; alternately published under the title Assignment in Space with Rip Foster. Planeteer Rip Foster undertakes capturing an asteroid of pure thorium and steering it to earth orbit. * \\"The Talking Stone\\" (1955), short story by Isaac Asimov. A group of miners is killed before they can reveal the coordinates of an asteroid particularly rich in uranium. * \\"The Rogue\\" (1963), short story by Poul Anderson. A tense love affair takes place between an entrepreneur, who represents a kind of reversion to 19th Century Capitalism, and a woman officer in a space warship sent by the Social Justice Party (in power at Washington D.C.) to clip that entrepreneur's wings. The encounter is the first skirmish in what eventually develops into a full-scale Asterite War of Independence (consciously modelled on the American one), told of in further stories. Anderson's asteroid stories were eventually collected in Tales of the Flying Mountains, where the flourishing Asteroid Republic makes of a terraformed asteroid the first interstellar ship, which in the course of generations would reach other stellar systems. The veterans who go along tell, for the edification of the young generation, their memoirs of the pioneering days. * Known Space (1964 onward) series of stories by Larry Niven. The Solar System is divided between the U.N.-dominated Earth and the Asteroid Belt, two competing political and cultural entities whose rivalry might at any moment descend into a destructive war ‚Äî forming the background to several books and the main theme of World of Ptavvs. In this universe, it is planets such as Mars which are the neglected backwaters, Belters spurning them and their gravity wells as fit only for \\"Flatlanders\\". * The Men in the Jungle (1967), novel by Norman Spinrad. The Asteroid Belt is originally colonized by Afrikaners who hog its mineral wealth and lord it over later-arrived immigrants from Third World countries ‚Äî in effect recreating Apartheid all over again. A revolution culminates with the creation of the Belt Free State, a republic far less stable than Anderson's which is headed by the likeable though thoroughly corrupt Bart Fraden. The intervention of the Big Powers from Earth, seeking to control the same mineral wealth, leads to Fraden's overthrow and his escape out of the Solar System ‚Äî setting the stage to further (quite grisly) adventures which are the book's main plot line. * \\"Tinker\\" (1975), short story in the collection High Justice, vol. 1 of the Future History series by Jerry Pournelle. The Asteroid Belt is dominated by a consortium of multinational corporations (upgraded to multi-planetary corporations by this time). Pournelle deliberately turns upside down the well-established rules of this subgenre by making the corporations and their field agent into the Good Guys of the story. The Bad Guys are the rugged miners of Jefferson Asteroid, who use assorted dirty tricks in their effort to get free of the corporations' rule ‚Äî an aspiration which a character describes as \\"an atavistic nationalism for which there is no room in the Belt\\". * Heechee (1976‚Äì2004) series of stories by Frederik Pohl. Explorers discover an asteroid orbiting perpendicular to the solar plane, filled with hundreds of small spaceships left aeons ago by a mysterious alien race which humans call \\"Heechee\\". Named Gateway by the discovers, the powerful nations of the world occupy the asteroid and subsequently form the Gateway Corporation to administer the object. Under their open eye, there develops a culture of adventurers and prospectors rather similar to that portrayed in other asteroid books. Here, however, the prospecting is not for mineral wealth but rather for interstellar discovery, to which the adventurers set out blindly in the hardly understood alien ships, in trips which can end with riches or death. * Red Dwarf (1988‚Äì1999), television series. Asteroids have presumably been mined for at least several decades, as Dave Lister is once heard singing a futuristic version of \\"Clementine\\" ‚Äì \\"On an asteroid / Evacuating for a mine / Lived an old plutonium miner / And his daughter Clementine...\\". The Jupiter Mining Corporation, which operates the ship Red Dwarf, presumably mines on asteroids (Red Dwarf itself mined the Neptunian moon Triton, according to the novels). * The Stone Dogs (1990), novel in the Draka series by S. M. Stirling. The Asteroid Belt is a major arena of the decades-long struggle between \\"The Domination of the Draka\\", a political and military entity bent on conquering everybody else and reducing them to literal slavery, and its arch-enemy \\"The Alliance for Democracy\\". Following \\"The Final War\\" of that history's 1998, the tough Asteroid miners are the last holdout against the victorious Draka. Though they eventually defect to the Draka, they are first able to launch \\"New America\\", a huge starship carrying some 100,000 colonists to the stars, to keep the cause alive and fight again another day. * Heavy Time (1991), novel by C. J. Cherryh. Mining of the asteroid belt of Earth's solar system is a critical part of the economy in the 24th century. A dispute over mining rights to a particularly large asteroid rich with valuable minerals involves ASTEX, a giant mining corporation, and the book describes in detail ASTEX's mining operations in the asteroid belt. * Several short stories by Geoffrey A. Landis, including \\"Outsider's Chance\\" (1998) and \\"Betting on Eureka\\" (2005), deal with mining asteroids.Review, Asimov's Science Fiction October/November 2005, Tangent Online 2006-02-12 (retrieved Jun 11 2014) * Live Free or Die (2010), novel by John Ringo. Asteroids are melted by sunlight concentrated by a distributed network of orbital mirrors, allowing the centripetal force of the asteroid's own rotation to separate it into concentric layers of its component materials, which are then peeled off one-by-one. One asteroid, known as Troy, is drilled into, stuffed with ice, and then melted, inflating it into a hollow metal shell in diameter and over thick, which is then developed into a space station used to defend the solar system from invading aliens. Navigational hazard Another way in which asteroids could be considered a source of danger is by depicting them as a hazard to navigation, especially threatening to ships travelling from Earth to the outer parts of the Solar System and thus needing to pass the Asteroid Belt (or make a time- and fuel- consuming detour around it). Asteroids in this context provide to space travel stories a space equivalent of reefs and underwater rocks in the older genre of seafaring adventures stories. And like reefs and rocks in the ocean, asteroids as navigation hazards can also be used by bold outlaws to avoid pursuit. Representations of the Asteroid Belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks. In reality, even in the asteroid belt, asteroids are spaced extremely far apart (even so, they can still be a risk to ships travelling at high speeds). * 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), film. 2001 accurately (and, for a work of fiction, atypically) depicts a \\"close approach\\" between the Discovery One and a binary asteroid while en route to Jupiter. The scene simply cuts briefly to two lone rocks passing by the ship, with tens of thousands of kilometres to spare. * 2061: Odyssey Three (1986), novel by Arthur C. Clarke. Clarke dispenses with the relative monotony of the journey from the first book, and instead applies ominous parallels to the journey of the RMS Titanic. During writing the novel, the Titanic's wreck had just been found. * The Wreck of The River of Stars (2003), novel by Michael Flynn. Themes of nautical adventure novels are transferred to an Asteroid Belt environment, with a dramatic account of cumulative accidents, mismatched good intentions and power struggles among crew members in a former space luxury liner turned tramp freighter (the \\"River of Stars\\" of the title) which culminate in a disastrous collision with an asteroid. * Space Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets (2004), television drama documentary by the BBC. The Pegasus encounters a binary asteroid from much closer than expected, and dubs the rocks \\"Hubris\\" and \\"Catastrophe\\" as a result. * Once Upon a Time... Space (1982), cartoon. Asteroid belts depicted there are presented unrealistically dense, allowing among other events to emulate the famous chase scene of The Empire Strikes Back. New asteroid belts A theme related to that of the Fifth Planet is the generation of a new asteroid belt, via the demolition of a planet, sometimes the Earth. The energy required to reduce a planet such as Earth to loose rubble is truly enormous: about 2 J, equivalent to the Sun's entire luminous energy output for about a week! * Facing the Flag (1896), novel by Jules Verne. A mad genius invents an enormously powerful new explosive, of which a few grams suffice to blow a passable tunnel through many metres of tough volcanic rock. One of the story's villains remarks that several thousand tons might be enough to blow up the entire Earth and render it into a new asteroid belt ‚Äì which (though no character in the story has any desire to actually try it) seems to be the first time that such a suggestion was made in science fiction. * Worlds of the Imperium (1962), novel by Keith Laumer. The hero, travelling in a vehicle capable of traversing parallel worlds, passes many where Earth had been shattered in a cataclysmic war and was rendered into a scattered collection of asteroids. He gets a brief and horrifying glimpse of an asteroid on which a section of road is still visible. Later, he learns that our own Earth narrowly avoided a similar fate. * The Corridors of Time (1965), novel by Poul Anderson. Two groups, the Wardens and the Rangers, wage a relentless struggle for control of Earth and the Solar System. As a result, Mars is blown up and its remnants become a new Asteroid Belt. The two fighting sides tacitly agree to use more subtle forms of fighting, involving mainly time-travel. * The Venus Belt (1980), novel by L. Neil Smith. The \\"useless\\" planet Venus is deliberately blown up to create a new asteroid belt. It is part of a genre of asteroid SF in which asteroids are rated as more valuable than planets. Spacecraft * Eon (1985), science fiction novel by Greg Bear. The asteroid Juno appears as a hollowed out asteroid/starship from the future, called the Thistledown. *The 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon episode \\"Poor Little Rich Turtle\\" includes Krang and Shredder trying to turn an asteroid into a spacecraft. As weapons * Protector (1973), novel by Larry Niven. Jack Brennan, a human turned into a \\"Pak Protector\\", commits genocide by causing an ice asteroid to collide with Mars, thereby causing a rise in the water content of its atmosphere and exterminating the native Martians to whom water is a deadly poison. * Footfall (1985), novel by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven. Elephant-like aliens launch an asteroid which lands in the Indian Ocean, causing a huge tsunami which almost completely wipes out life in India and causes enormous damage to all countries which have shores on that ocean. * Metal Armor Dragonar (1987), anime. The Lunar-based Giganos Empire uses a mass driver to fire asteroids at the Earth and space colonies. * The Last Command (1993), novel by Timothy Zahn set in the Star Wars universe. The Galactic Empire makes a number of asteroids invisible and places them in low orbit around the New Republic controlled world Coruscant, forcing them to divert resources from the war effort to find them before they deorbit and hit the densely populated city. * Starship Troopers (1997), film, loosely based on the 1959 novel by Robert A. Heinlein. Aliens launch an asteroid at Earth, completely wiping out Buenos Aires. This is the opening move in the war. * \\"Fail Safe\\" (2002), episode of Stargate SG-1 television series. A Goa'uld surreptitiously diverts an asteroid to a collision course with Earth. * Sunstorm (2005), novel by Stephen Baxter and Arthur C. Clarke. Extraterrestrials attempt to cause Earth's destruction by way of a \\"cosmic bullet\\" projectile sent into the Sun. * Live Free or Die (2010) and its sequel Citadel by John Ringo, in which asteroids are melted, inflated, and turned into unstoppable battleships of space. *Nemesis Games (2015) and Babylon's Ashes (2016), novels by James S. A. Corey where asteroids are used as weapons to attack Earth. Extrasolar asteroids Some works of fiction take place on, or in, asteroid-like bodies or fields outside the Solar System: * Miners in The Sky (1967), novel by Murray Leinster. The ring system around Thotmess, a gas giant in the system of the star Niletus where planets are called for Ancient Egyptian gods, is a completely lawless place where \\"claim jumping\\" is frequent. Miners, riding small \\"donkey ships\\", need to contend with both the harsh natural environment and with fierce human competitors. They must be ready at any moment to take up a gun or a bazooka to defend their finds of \\"grey matrix in which abyssal crystals occur\\". (The reader is not told what this may be, except that it is evidently valuable enough to kill for.) The extra-solar environment is chosen by Leinster in order to convey the feeling of an ever-expanding frontier ‚Äì Sol's own Asteroid Belt has become \\"tame\\", as did the rings of Saturn, and the rough adventurous types move further on. (The historical model is obviously the recurring Gold Rush of the Nineteenth Century, drawing adventurers in 1840s from the settled East Coast to wild California, and in 1890s from settled California to the wild Klondike). * Star Trek episode \\"For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\\" (1968). A generational ship called the Yonada is shaped like an asteroid. * The Mote in God's Eye (1974), novel by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven. The novel features the examination of evidence indicating the use of asteroids in planetary bombardment as the final strategy of a war that almost wipes out the warring species. * Outcasts of Heaven Belt (1978, expanded from a 1976 story), novel by Joan D. Vinge, in which an extraterrestrial solar system is originally named the \\"heaven belt,\\" and colonized because its extensive asteroid belt gives access to resources. * Star Wars (1977), film by George Lucas. In demonstrating the ability of the newly constructed Death Star to destroy planets, Grand Moff Tarkin destroys the planet Alderaan, thereby creating an asteroid field that the Millennium Falcon haplessly stumbles into when attempting to visit the planet. * The Empire Strikes Back (1980), film. Han Solo enters an asteroid field to flee from the fleet of the evil Empire. Han then hides his ship, the Millennium Falcon inside a giant asteroid; the ship then finds itself inside a colossal animal that lives within the asteroid. *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode \\"Golden Man\\" (1981, season 2). The spaceship Searcher enters the asteroid belt of the Alpha Centauri system and becomes trapped against an asteroid by a powerful magnetic storm while responding to a distress radiobeacon signal, the plot involves the crew visiting an Earth-like planet Iris VII that exists within the belt so that they can escape the asteroid's gravity and destruction of the Searcher. * Gap Cycle (1991‚Äì1996), series of novels by Stephen R. Donaldson's. Numerous human asteroid colonies, albeit not in the Solar System's Asteroid Belt. * Night's Dawn Trilogy (1996‚Äì1999), novel trilogy by Peter F. Hamilton. Worlds colonized by humans use asteroids as their main source of minerals and location of their industries. The asteroids are either in orbit around a colonized world, are moved into orbit to be used as a base for the industry, or are in an asteroid belt. * Halo: The Fall of Reach, novel by Eric Nylund (2001). Describes an assault by Spartans on a hidden rebel base located within a hollowed-out asteroid.

Raw materials are mined from an asteroid to gather resources vital to the fleet. * Halo: The Cole Protocol (2008), novel by Tobias Buckell. Describes a massive linked cloud of asteroids trailing the orbit of a gas giant. The links contain mass transit systems. * Strikebreaker (short story) (1957) by Isaac Asimov. The world in question is Elsevere, an extrasolar planetoid a hundred miles in diameter which is home to an insular, idiosyncratic human colony of thirty thousand people, who have inhabited the planet in all three dimensions. A rigid caste system has developed, with each occupation being confined to a particular set of families. A visiting Earth sociologist, Steven Lamorak, learns that Igor Ragusnik has gone on strike.

Its user interface allows the user to set breakpoints and/or step through execution of script code line by line, and examine values of variables and properties after any step. In effect, it provides a way for developers to see script code behavior as it runs, thus eliminating much of the guess-work when things don't quite work as intended. Microsoft considers it to be deprecated in favor of the more sophisticated Microsoft Script Editor (MSE.EXE),The download details page indicates Script Debugger is deprecated, but doesn't say in favor of what. It could be MSE, but it could also be Visual Studio. an optional tool included in Microsoft Office 2000 through Office 2007. Also, Internet Explorer 8 comes with a different, tightly integrated JScript debugger part of the Internet Explorer Developer Tools. Features According to Microsoft, the Script Debugger provides these traditional debugging features: * Ability to set and clear breakpoints. * Ability to step through and over procedures. * Ability to display and change the values of variables and properties. * Ability to evaluate expressions. * Ability to view the call stack, and navigate to any currently loaded procedure. Additionally, it can open and edit HTML pages, and it supports script colorization for improved readability. Limitations The debugger has several limitations, including the following: * The line indicator may be incorrect when stepping through inline JScript or debugging a framed document. * When debugging documents open in Internet Explorer, only one can be debugged at a time. * Commands typed in the Command window have no effect unless the user is in break mode. * A breakpoint immediately after a Document.Write is ignored. * Entering a Document.Write command while debugging, or refreshing a document in Internet Explorer while debugging it, can cause hangs or other unexpected behavior. * Unlike in other debuggers, there is no Watch window for monitoring variables; they must be checked via manual commands. * Unlike in other debuggers, breakpoints can't be set by clicking in the left margin; they must be set via keypress or menu. Usage After installation, new options can be found in Internet Explorer's Script Debugger menu, which gets added in the View menu. Debugging can optionally be turned off from the Advanced tab in the Internet Options dialog.

He is a former communist leader who served as the model for a colourful character in Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa's novel \\"Conversation in the Cathedral.\\" He was Vargas Llosa's teacher of Marxism- Leninism when the writer became a member of a university communist cell. Personal life Isaac Humala N√∫√±ez, who is of Andean origin and speaks Quechua, is the father of Ollanta Humala, a former president of Peru. His wife Elena Tasso Heredia is from an old Italian family that established itself in Peru at the end of the 19th century. One of his other sons, Antauro Humala, a former army major, ran a rebellion against the government's policies in the Andean city of Andahuaylas in December 2004, in which a police station was seized and some people were killed. His eldest son, Ulises Humala, also ran for president in 2006, and currently occupies a full-time position as a Professor at the National University of Engineering in Peru. Humala is a self- proclaimed subversive: \\"a patriot has to be...Christ was and so are we\\", he declared in an interview. Beliefs Humala's Instituto de Estudios Etnogeopol√≠ticos (IEE) is the brain trust of the Movimiento Etnocacerista, which he founded in 1989. He has been an active member of the Communist Party of Peru ‚Äì Red Fatherland. According to Humala: \\"the human species had four races, of which one is practically separate, the white one that dominates the world, the yellow has two powers, China and Japan, and the Black, although without the same weight as the others, at least dominates its own continent. On the other hand, ours does not govern anywhere.\\" 2006 Peruvian general election Vargas Llosa published an editorial on January 15, 2006 attacking Issac Humala's beliefs. Humala has said that his movement advocates more political sovereignty for Peru's indigenous members as they suffer more than the descendants of Europeans, who he believes hold too much influence in Peru and throughout the Andes. During the 2006 Peruvian general election, Humala, father of candidates Ollanta and Ulises, said that he would free Shining Path and MRTA leaders Abimael Guzm√°n and V√≠ctor Polay, since he considers that terrorist movements no longer represent a threat to Peruvian society. This came after a letter was signed by several public figures, including Ulises and fellow candidates Javier Diez Canseco and Alberto Moreno, demanding a fair trial for Polay.

A temporary station building is currently in place while a new station is constructed. The station serves six Amtrak trains daily: two daily Empire Service round trips and one Maple Leaf round trip. The station is approximately two blocks away from the Erie Canal Harbor and Seneca stations on the Buffalo Metro Rail light rail line. It is also close to the KeyBank Center and Sahlen Field. There is also daily Coach USA bus service at the station, operating between Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center and Jamestown, New York, via Dunkirk and Fredonia, and serving the communities along the southeast shore of Lake Erie.Coach Usa Western New York: Jamestown ‚Äì Buffalo Line Run The temporary station has one low-level side platform on the north side of two tracks. History There have been four New York Central Railroad stations on Exchange Street in Buffalo. Buffalo's first true railroad passenger station was built in 1848 on Exchange Street. It was a small brick building that was added to or changed at least 5 times during its use. It was built by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. The third station on the site was built in 1880. The biggest issue with the Exchange Street site at the time aside from the station's small size for being the main station in Buffalo was that it was plagued with downtown congestion as the crossings in and out of the area were at grade and therefore had to contend with busy city streets. The station's importance declined after Buffalo Central Terminal which was built to solve the issues at the Exchange Street site opened in 1929. The third Exchange Street station was closed on November 13, 1935, and demolished shortly after. Fourth station building The fourth Buffalo‚ÄìExchange Street station in 2011 Planning for the fourth and final New York Central structure began in 1949. New York heavily funded the station as being part of the Skyway construction. The total cost was $7 million. The station opened on August 2, 1952 as a secondary station to the Buffalo Central Terminal. The station originally served 21 New York Central and Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway trains daily. The double track station had two side platforms connected by an overhead walkway. Soon after the station was built passenger rail service began a steep decline that would eventually lead to the end of private passenger rail service in the United States. As part of the decline and problems within the railroad, in 1961, the New York Central Railroad ceased passenger operations to Niagara Falls, and the station building was closed, though some trains continued to stop at the platforms for a brief time. During this time the overhead walkway that connected the station's two platforms was demolished. The station in November 1980 before reduction to single track On October 29, 1978, Amtrak routed the Niagara Rainbow through Niagara Falls, restoring service to downtown Buffalo and to the station. One old platform was reused immediately; a temporary structure was used for Niagara Rainbow and Empire State Express passengers while the station building was renovated. Exchange Street became one of the two main Buffalo train stations alongside the then-new Buffalo‚ÄìDepew station when Buffalo Central Terminal closed in 1979. The line was later reduced to single track in the 1980s and the second platform was abandoned. By the 2000s, the Buffalo‚ÄìExchange Street station had gained a reputation for being long outdated and in a such a deteriorating condition that it got dubbed as one of the saddest Amtrak stations in America by CityLab in 2015. In September 2016, the station building was temporarily closed due to a partial collapse during heavy rains, further highlighting the need for a new station. The platforms remained open for passengers. Demolition of the 1952 station began on August 22, 2019, to make way for the new station. Replacement station The temporary station constructed during demolition and reconstruction of Exchange Street station Beginning in 2016, there were proposals to replace the station with either a station at Canalside or at Buffalo Central Terminal as part of that building's restoration. The downtown location - close to the current Exchange Street location - was chosen because of its proximity to the central business district, though public opinion strongly favored the Buffalo Central Terminal site. Supporters of the latter site alleged that the selection was made for political favors rather than on the merits of the downtown site. On April 17, 2017, a panel including Buffalo mayor Byron Brown approved the downtown location. The New York State Department of Transportation awarded a $27.7 million design-build contract in December 2018, with completion expected in Fall 2020. Construction of a temporary station began in June 2019. The new station is and is closer to Exchange Street and higher in elevation then the previous station so the building is not shadowed by the nearby Interstate 190 viaduct. In addition there is a lit, covered pedestrian walkway under I-190 to connect the train station to Metro Rail on Main Street. The station also has a high-level platform, space for a waiting room on the east side of the building, and 14 canopied parking spaces for Greyhound, Trailways and NFTA buses if they are later added. The new Buffalo‚ÄìExchange Street station in 2020 came as part of upgrades made to the Empire Corridor which also included new stations in Niagara Falls in 2016, Rochester in 2017 and Schenectady in 2018.

It was the first battlefield command for the Marquis de Lafayette.  Background  In mid-1777, British General William Howe embarked on a plan to regain control of Britain's rebellious Thirteen Colonies by capturing Philadelphia, the city where the Continental Congress met. He successfully captured the city in September 1777, and then, after consolidating his command of the city by repulsing an attack from General George Washington's Continental Army at Germantown in October, sought to gain control of the Delaware River as far north as the city, on which his army depended for supplies. After a Hessian assault on Fort Mercer, one of the principal defenses on the New Jersey side of the river, was repulsed in the Battle of Red Bank, Howe sent part of his army across the Delaware to Gloucester, New Jersey under the command of Lord Cornwallis to take Fort Mercer. Washington reacted to this by detaching forces under General Nathanael Greene across the Delaware just north of Gloucester. Greene was accompanied by the Marquis de Lafayette, a young French officer who had accompanied Washington at the Battle of Brandywine. Lafayette had been wounded in the foot in that battle, and, while it was not fully healed, he was eager to join the action. Greene ordered Lafayette out to on a reconnaissance mission to determine the location and strength of Cornwallis' army.  Battle  Lafayette led 350 men toward the British position. He carefully scouted the British camp, at times personally coming within firing range of British sentries. He then led his men in a surprise attack on a forward picket of j√§gers. The 400 Hessians were caught completely unprepared, and began a disorganized fighting retreat toward the main British camp, with Lafayette and his men giving chase. Cornwallis sent some grenadiers to provide covering fire as the Germans retreated, and Lafayette withdrew under cover of darkness, returning to Greene.Unger, p. 54  Aftermath  Lafayette's reconnaissance was a success. He suffered only one killed and five wounded, against 60 casualties on the British side. Word of the operation was instrumental in a decision by Congress to award him a commission as a major general in the Continental Army.Tuckerman, pp. 50‚Äì51  References   External links  *Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

Considered to be part of the Farnborough/Aldershot Built-up Area and nearly contiguous to Camberley, Surrey, it is centred WSW from London. Location The northern (and, respectively, eastern) borders of Blackwater are a mixture of water-meadows and roads to Berkshire (Bracknell Forest) and Surrey (Surrey Heath). The town is centred west of Camberley, NNW of Farnborough, and east of Basingstoke. As with that much larger town, Camberley and Bagshot, it straddles the A30 road. It is centred west-southwest of London. A pre-1900 distance sign near the nightclub on the A30, in Camberley marks \\"London - 30 miles\\", from which the centre of Blackwater is less than a mile. The town and Aldershot Urban Area (Blackwater Valley conurbation) which includes the towns of Farnborough, Aldershot, Camberley, Sandhurst, Yateley, Frimley and Farnham are in the outer half of the London Commuter Belt, the fastest link being Farnborough (Main) Station on the South Western Main Line. The place sits west where the A30 trunk road from London to Land's End crosses the River Blackwater. It is served by Blackwater railway station which is on the non-interchanging line, midway, between Reading and Guildford. History The first record of Blackwater, archived and known, is in 1281, when it was known as Bredeford. It grew around the ford (soon after seen as Brydrs Ford) across the Blackwater. The White Hart Parade of shops and offices, to the west of Blackwater station, is named after the White Hart coaching inn that occupied the site in the late 19th century. Transport connections Trains from Blackwater station operate with a half-hourly service to Reading, and to Gatwick Airport or the shorter- stop Redhill both via Guildford. Trains do not operate directly to London, requiring a change to London Paddington at Reading, or to London Waterloo at Guildford or Wokingham. At peak times, some additional trains operate; which usually go beyond Guildford to Shalford. Trains are operated by Great Western Railway. Train passengers seeking to commute to Farnborough North for the Sixth Form College or for London-bound trains from nearby Farnborough Main are advised that these are on the few full-stopping-services only, as a semi-fast stopping pattern prevailingly operates for convenience of the whole line and regional transport. Buses to Camberley operate every 15 minutes via Route 3. Local economy Blackwater is a gateway town into Hampshire on a main national route (the A30). This 'high street' area is a dual-carriageway which subsides to singled west of the town. It passes over Blackwater railway station, as well as passing over the River Blackwater itself. Aldi, and shortly after a new Lidl supermarket was built opposite Aldi in 2003, taking up most of the shopping floorspace in the town. Blackwater has two public houses, Mr Bumble and The Royal Swan. There are two parades of shops which include food outlets, a pharmacy, a newsagent and a vinyl record store. The largest nearby town is Camberley, which provides many jobs for residents of Blackwater due to its wide range of shops, particularly within The Mall, Camberley. Other nearby towns include Sandhurst, home to the Royal Military Academy. Entrance to Java House, Sun Microsystems Sun Microsystems were a major employer in the Blackwater Valley and their UK headquarters were in Blackwater at Guillemont Park, at the M3 motorway junction on the site of the former Guillemont Barracks. Following Oracle's acquisition of Sun in 2009, employees were relocated to Oracle's UK headquarters in the Thames Valley Park. Suburbs There are two suburban villages to the north, Frogmore and Darby Green, which are considered by Hart District council to be districts of Blackwater. Frogmore has its own modern village hall, village green, church and a small shopping parade. Darby Green has a shopping parade (including a Tesco Express) and a small youth centre. There is also a modern medical surgery between the two villages on Frogmore Road. The village of Hawley, which has its own village hall, primary school, church, private leisure centre and equestrian centre, lies less than to the south on the road towards Farnborough.

Unsolved\\") is an interactive German television programme first broadcast on 20 October 1967 on ZDF. Created by Eduard Zimmermann, it aims to combat and solve crimes. The programme is currently presented by Rudi Cerne. It airs monthly, with 12 episodes in a year, on Wednesday at 8:15 PM. Until December 2002 it was produced in cooperation with the Austrian public service broadcaster ORF and Schweizer Fernsehen, a division of the Swiss public broadcaster SRG SSR. The programme was adapted by the BBC as Crimewatch and for the US market as America's Most Wanted, and Unsolved Mysteries. Other adaptations aired in Canada, Poland, Hungary and New Zealand. The goal of the programme is to throw light on unsolved offences with the aid of viewers. Each episode contains three to five short films, each lasting about ten minutes, in which a real criminal case is reconstructed. The cases are mostly complex ones in which the criminals and chains of events are still unknown. In addition cases are discussed in the studio in which, for example, the identities of criminals or unknown murder victims are sought with the aid of a photo. Viewers can use the telephone or Internet to give information. According to a study by the programme's editorial department, about forty percent of cases shown on the programme are solved.  History  Logo used from the early-2000s until October 2014 The creator and first presenter of the programme was Eduard Zimmermann. After the programme's 300th episode he passed the presentership onto Butz Peters, who fronted the show together with Zimmermann's daughter Sabine. Since 18 January 2002 Aktenzeichen XY has been presented by Rudi Cerne. With Aktenzeichen XY Eduard Zimmermann and ZDF succeeded in starting a TV format that had not existed worldwide until 1967. Although news reports had often shown photofits, an actual independent show of this type was unknown at this time. The idea came to Zimmermann during his work with the programme ' (Eng: Beware, Trap!) first broadcast in 1963, in which he warned the viewers of \\"Nepper, Schlepper und Bauernf√§nger\\" (Eng: Scammers, Hustlers and Conmen). The viewers frequently sent him information regarding descriptions of the fraudsters on the programme. This gave him the idea to use the medium of TV to work with the police on unsolved crimes. In a biographical statement Zimmerman also admitted that his motivation for both programmes was partly a personal one; he himself is a victim of fraud. Aktenzeichen XY was initially produced in the ZDF studios in Wiesbaden, before moving to the FSM studios in Unterf√∂hring from 1969. From 15 March 1968, the Austrian public broadcaster ORF became a joint producer of Aktenzeichen XY, with a segment focusing on Austria hosted first by Thadd√§us \\"Teddy\\" Podgorski (de) from 1968 until 1971, then by Peter Nidetzky (de) from 1971 until 2002; which from 24 January 1969 was also joined by Schweizer Fernsehen (SF), with a segment focused on Switzerland hosted firstly by Werner Vetterli from 1969 until 1976, then by Konrad Toenz (de) from 1976 until 1998, and finally Stephan Schifferer from 1998 until 2002. An attempt to extend Aktenzeichen XY beyond West Germany first took place on 18 July 1969, when ZDF and the Dutch public broadcaster NOS produced a joint episode featuring Dutch journalist Johan van Minnen from a studio in Enschede, with NOS providing simultaneous translations from German to Dutch. That project was however unsuccessful due to language barriers and was abandoned after said broadcast. A more successful attempt took place on 14 July 1972, when the West German branch of the American Forces Network (AFN) took part in a broadcast of Aktenzeichen XY, with simultaneous interpretation into English on AFN TV. The first colour episode of Aktenzeichen XY aired on ZDF on 16 January 1975. On 8 November 2002, the broadcast of the 350th episode was celebrated, after Aktenzeichen XY had been on the air for 35 years. Eduard Zimmermann was the guest of Rudi Cerne on his own programme, which concerned a several-decades-old crime that had particularly touched him - the Ursula Herrmann kidnapping, about a young girl who was buried alive in a crate for extortion on 15 September 1981 (a case similar to the case of Barbara Jane Mackle, although the Mail Online states that the inspiration actually came from Dirty Harry), but suffocated in her prison because the ventilation duct was clogged up by leaves. At the time 3,228 cases had been featured on the show, of which 1,182 had been solved. 1,880 people had been sought and 914 of them had been caught. This included 624 murder cases. In April 2012 the program received international public attention of a somewhat amusing nature when one of its case re-enactment performers, German actor , was erroneously arrested in Stuttgart following his portrayal of a jewel robber in the episode of 14 March 2012 and a call to the police by one of the program's viewers. This misunderstanding was, however, cleared very swiftly.Jens Witte: So gut wie echt, Spiegel Online, April 23, 2012.

A 2-hour special episode of Aktenzeichen XY aired on 16 October 2013, dealing with the case of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007 at the age of three. McCann's parents and a Scotland Yard detective were also featured in the broadcast.

In 2014, Aktenzeichen XY is still watched by around six million viewers with an audience share by 20%.

Widespread in many areas, it is an important food source for other fish, including the cutthroat trout.  Range  The tui chub's range includes the Lahontan and Central system of the Great Basin, as well as the Owens and Mojave Rivers.FishBase, 2006 It is found in the Pit River and Goose Lake of the upper Central Valley, in the Klamath River system, and in the Columbia River drainage.  Description  The form and appearance of the tui chub is variable; many were originally described as different species by J. O. Snyder, but have since been reduced to subspecies. In general, the color is deep olive above and white below, with a smooth variation in shading along the sides, and a brassy reflection. Fins are olive and sometimes tinted with red. The pectoral fins are far forward and low on the body. Length has been recorded at up to , but is more typical.  Habitat and behavior  Tui chubs are found in a variety of habitats, including anything from small streams to large lakes and reservoirs, and both high cold lakes, such as Lake Tahoe, and warmer desert streams. They spawn between late April and early August, depending on temperatures. In Pyramid Lake the peak season is June; males move inshore first, then congregate around arriving females in shallow water, preferring areas of heavy vegetation. The female scatters her eggs randomly over a wide area, where they are then fertilized by several males. The hatchlings remain in the heavy vegetation for the remainder of the summer. In Lake Tahoe some chubs spawn around stream mouths in July. Tui chub diet is varied; young fish eat mostly invertebrates, adding plant material and especially algae as they mature. Habits also vary by location and the fineness of the gill rakers, so for instance fine-rakered forms in Pyramid Lake feed more on plankton in open water than the coarse-rakered forms, which live near the bottom and eats more plants and algae. The largest individuals will eat other fish also. In Pyramid Lake the endangered Lahontan cutthroat trout feeds on the tui chub; the Lahontan cutthroat trout has been studied extensively due to water management decisions affecting the water quality of the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake.C.M. Hogan, 1987  Subspecies  The exact number of subspecies is not known; Sigler & Sigler estimate as high as 16.

Since 1786 some secular priests opened a missionary center, but soon had to flee to the opposition of the ministers of other Christian denominations. When in 1816 the territory passed into the hands of the Dutch, was guaranteed freedom of worship. This was the real starting point of Catholic evangelization of what today is called Suriname. In 1817 was erected the Apostolic Prefecture of Dutch Guyana, which became apostolic vicariate in 1842 and the mission was entrusted in a special way to the Redemptorists. On 7 May 1958 the apostolic vicariate was elevated to the rank of diocese, then Diocese of Paramaribo.

It was long thought to be by the leading painter of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, Pieter Bruegel the Elder. However, following technical examinations in 1996 of the painting hanging in the Brussels museum, that attribution is regarded as very doubtful, and the painting, perhaps painted in the 1560s, is now usually seen as a good early copy by an unknown artist of Bruegel's lost original, perhaps from about 1558. According to the museum: \\"It is doubtful the execution is by Bruegel the Elder, but the composition can be said with certainty to be his\\",Says the Museum: \\"On doute que l'ex√©cution soit de Pieter I Bruegel mais la conception lui est par contre attribu√©e avec certitude\\", although recent technical research has re-opened the question. Largely derived from Ovid, the painting is described in W. H. Auden's famous poem \\"Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts\\", named after the museum in Brussels which holds the painting, and became the subject of a poem of the same name by William Carlos Williams, as well as \\"Lines on Bruegel's 'Icarus'\\" by Michael Hamburger.Rico, 19 (gives text) Description Landscape with The Fall of Icarus, ca. 1590‚Äì95, oil on wood (), Circle of P. Bruegel the Elder, Museum van Buuren, Brussels, Belgium In Greek mythology, Icarus succeeded in flying, with wings made by his father Daedalus, using feathers secured with beeswax. Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. Daedalus does not appear in this version of the painting, though he does, still flying, in the van Buuren one (see below). The ploughman, shepherd and angler are mentioned in Ovid's account of the legend; they are: \\"astonished and think to see gods approaching them through the aether\\", which is not entirely the impression given in the painting. The shepherd gazing into the air, away from the ship, may be explained by another version of the composition (see below); in the original work there was probably also a figure of Daedalus in the sky to the left, at which he stares. There is also a Flemish proverb (of the sort imaged in other works by Bruegel): \\"And the farmer continued to plough...\\" (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort\\") pointing out the ignorance of people to fellow men's suffering. The painting may, as Auden's poem suggests, depict humankind's indifference to suffering by highlighting the ordinary events which continue to occur, despite the unobserved death of Icarus. Though the world landscape, a type of work with the title subject represented by small figures in the distance, was an established type in Early Netherlandish painting, pioneered by Joachim Patiner, to have a much larger unrelated \\"genre\\" figure in the foreground is original and represents something of a blow against the emerging hierarchy of genres. Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example The Hunters in the Snow (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a \\"higher\\" class of painting in the background. However, paintings from the same period by the Antwerp artist Pieter Aertsen had large kitchen or market genre scenes, with large figures in the foreground, and in the distant background a glimpse of a scene from the Life of Christ. Giving more prominence to \\"low\\" subject-matter than \\"high\\" in the same work is a feature of some Northern Mannerist art, often called \\"Mannerist inversion\\". The traditional moral of the Icarus story, warning against excessive ambition, is reinforced by (literally) fore-grounding humbler figures who appear content to fill useful agricultural roles in life.Hagen, Rose-Marie and Rainer; What Great Paintings Say, vol 1, 265, 2005, 2 vols, Taschen, Attribution Icarus and the angler The painting is probably a version of a lost original by Bruegel. A date of c. 1558 has been suggested for the lost original, based on Bruegel's other works; the copy probably comes from the 1560s or soon after. It is in oils whereas Bruegel's other paintings on canvas are in tempera. The work was unknown until it was bought by the museum in 1912; subsequently another version on panel, generally considered inferior, turned up, which was acquired in 1953 by Daniel van Buuren for his private house, today a museum in Brussels.de Vries:4 In this, which excludes the far left and right sides of the composition, Icarus is in the water but Daedelus is still in the air, and the shepherd's gaze is directed at him, explaining one aspect of the composition of the other version. The original would have been Bruegel's only known painting of a mythological subject. The perspective of the ship and figures is not entirely consistent, although this may enhance the power of the composition. Bruegel also produced a design for an engraving with the ship and the two falling figures. Since its acquisition by the Museum in 1912, its authenticity has been challenged by several specialists, mainly for two reasons: (i) the relatively weak quality of the painting compared to other Bruegels, although this question is complicated by later overpainting; (ii) it is an oil painting on canvas, an exception in the work of Peter Bruegel the Elder who made all his oil paintings on panel. In 1963, Philippe Roberts-Jones, curator at the museum, and the Bruegel specialist Georges Marlier, hypothesized that an original panel painting had been later moved onto canvas, as was once common. Scientific tests In 1998, a mixed team of scientists from the Belgian Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage and the University of Utrecht attempted to solve the authenticity problem by a radiocarbon dating of the canvas that was supposed to be the original support. As mentioned here above, the conclusion of this dating was that P. Bruegel the Elder cannot have painted on this canvas. Later, in 2006, Prof. J. Reisse (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles) challenged this dating on technical grounds. The upturned face in the bushes A sample of blue paint taken from the right edge in 1973 was re-examined by performing analysis such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled to the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which in connection with optical microscopy revealed the following structure and composition. From bottom to top: # Canvas (from transposition); # Oily lead white (adhesive); # Thick oily layer with azurite (repaint); # Chalk ground; # Oily lead white with scarce particles of charcoal; # Oily blue with azurite; with layers 4 to 6 being original. The presence of chalk ground under the original blue proves that this is a panel painting transposed on a canvas. The original blue layer is lead white with azurite containing a few grains of ochre and charcoal. These structure and composition match perfectly those found on other certified panels of Peter Bruegel. Moreover, it is noticeable that the wood charcoal particles are very peculiar, being very long and acicular, exactly the same as those found only in The Census from the same Museum. This related work by Joos de Momper includes the ploughman and angler, but Icarus is still in flight, with wax drops falling. Recently, a study of the underdrawing using infrared reflectography has been published. Reflectography is based on the fact that the infrared light penetrates all colors except black. As a result, the drawing, mostly black, can be made visible. The interpretation of these reflectograms is of course more subjective, but in a global way, the drawing from the Fall of Icarus is not really different from other certified works from Peter Bruegel the Elder. This drawing is generally limited to a layout of the elements. Probably because the thin, weakly covering paint on white ground would hide imperfectly a detailed graphism. A re-interpretation of the reflectograms in agreement with the other analysis suggested the conclusion that the work in the Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels is a panel painting transferred to canvas. The paint layer and maybe also the underdrawing have been severely damaged by this intervention as well as by two more relinings, responsible for the heavy overpainting. In the paint sample remains a fragment with structure and composition matching perfectly the technique of the large panels attributed to Peter Bruegel the Elder. It is therefore unlikely that this version of the Fall of Icarus might be from the hand of a copyist, except perhaps from P. Bruegel the Younger. Conversely, the Van Buuren copy with a different technique cannot be attributed to either Peter Bruegel. Mentions in other media The painting is shown in Nicolas Roeg's film The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), where a character opens a book of paintings to an image of it. On the facing page a description points out that the scene remains calm, the event of the fall hardly noticed. Eric Steele, whose film The Bridge (2006) documents the suicides of two-dozen people who jumped off the world's most popular suicide site - the Golden Gate Bridge - throughout 2004, has compared images captured in his documentary to those of Bruegel's Landscape With the Fall of Icarus, because the fatal leaps go almost unnoticed by passersby. Composer Brian Ferneyhough's 1988 chamber work La Chute d'Icare was inspired by the painting: > What this piece attempts to suggest is ... less a reflection on the heroic- > tragic dimension of the underlying myth than a transcription of the strange > sensation of ‚Äúalready having been‚Äù which is brilliantly evoked by Breughel > in the view of a world serenely pursuing its own concerns, completely > oblivious to the almost invisible tiny pair of legs waving pathetically out > of the water, the only record of the apocalyptic event being a pair of > feathers floating disconsolately down in the wake of their erstwhile owner.

The painting features prominently in Frank Ceruzzi's dystopian play Round Went the Wheel (2019), where children take control of the world and use the painting and the Icarus myth as a way to teach the adult population about hubris and the dangers of technology. The painting is mentioned by W. H. Auden in his 1938 poem, Mus√©e des Beaux Arts, in which Icarus's fall is perceived by the ploughman as \\"not an important failure\\". The painting is also the subject of the Titus Andronicus song, Upon Viewing Bruegel‚Äôs Landscape with the Fall of Icarus. : > In the painting from the original song, in the corner, you see this tiny guy > falling into the ocean.

Cover art by Richard Corben. Deathworld is the name of a series of science fiction novels by American writer Harry Harrison, including the books Deathworld (first published 1960, serialized in Astounding Science Fiction), Deathworld 2 (1964, initially titled The Ethical Engineer and serialized in Analog) and Deathworld 3 (1968, serialized in Analog as The Horse Barbarians), plus the short story \\"The Mothballed Spaceship\\" (1973, written as part of a tribute to John W. Campbell). The central hero is a gambler who becomes involved with colonists of an extremely hostile planet. There are several hints that the novels take place in the same universe as Harrison's The Stainless Steel Rat series; however, other hints suggest a similar universe but not exactly the same one. For example, at several points in the Deathworld series, the novels mention the Special Corps with Inskipp as its leader; however, the story \\"The Mothballed Spaceship\\" mentions an armada about to attack Earth‚Äîa planet that is long destroyed in the time of The Stainless Steel Rat universe. Synopsis Deathworld centers on Jason dinAlt, a professional gambler who uses his erratic psionic abilities to tip the odds in his favor. While visiting the planet Cassylia, he is challenged by a man named Kerk Pyrrus (an ambassador of the planet Pyrrus) to turn a large amount of money into an immense sum by gambling at a government-run casino. He succeeds and survives the planetary government's desperate efforts to take back the money. Bothered that he may finally have met someone superior to him, he decides to accompany Kerk to Pyrrus, despite being warned that it is the deadliest world ever colonized by humans. There have been numerous supernovae in a region, meaning that planets in the area are rich in valuable radioactive ores, but Pyrrus is the only even marginally habitable one, and thus the only one that can support sustained mining operations. Pyrrus is no paradise. It has a gravity of 2 g; its 42¬∞ axial tilt creates severe weather; it has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions; two large moons generate tides of up to 30 meters; and finally, there are high levels of radiation. Everything on the planet is deadly to humans. The large animals are strong enough to destroy small vehicles, while the small ones have neurotoxic venom. Even the plants are deadly. All microorganisms consume insufficiently protected tissue as quickly as acids. On top of all this, life evolves so quickly that even Kerk and his Pyrran crew have to be retrained upon their return in order to survive. Because of this harsh environment, the settlers are engaged in a ceaseless struggle to survive, which‚Äîdespite generations of acclimation and a training regime harsher than that of ancient Spartans‚Äîthey are losing. The money Jason won is used to buy desperately needed weapons. While acclimating to the harsh planet, Jason turns his attentions toward solving the planet's mysteries and saving the faltering colony. The few surviving historical records Jason finds show that the settlers numbers have decreased since the planet was first colonized, and they are now restricted to a single settlement. Extrapolating backward, it is clear to Jason that the flora and fauna were once far less hostile to humans. Jason also learns of greatly despised \\"grubbers\\", humans living outside the city, with whom the Pyrrans grudgingly trade hardware for increasingly necessary food. After several weeks, Jason leaves the city in search of the grubbers, who live in harmony with the harsh environment. They practice what many would consider suicidal forms of animal husbandry, with the assistance of their telepathic \\"talkers\\". Jason is able to earn their trust by demonstrating his own abilities. The outsiders' knowledge of the initial colonization effort is even more intriguing than that of the city dwellers. Not long after their arrival, animals suddenly began attacking the city, and have not stopped since. However, a number of colonists lived outside the city. Though they still found the planet incredibly harsh, they never suffered such attacks. The grubbers are their descendants. The two factions despise each other. The grubbers hate the city Pyrrans, or \\"junkmen\\", for cutting them off from space and refusing to trade food or ore for scientific knowledge or advanced technology‚Äîparticularly medicine. The junkmen hate the grubbers for thriving while they are dying. While studying the grubber community, he notices an anomaly‚Äîthough the life-forms throughout the area are dangerous, they are nowhere near as lethal as the ones around the city. Some grubbers theorize that the initial schism was a disagreement over the city's location, in which the ancestors of the grubbers abandoned the dangerous ground in favor of their current homes. Jason has the grubbers guide him back to the city, so he can see it from the outside. There his psionic senses confirm his hypothesis. Every species of native flora and fauna is psionic, and all life around the city is telepathically \\"shouting\\" the same thing: KILL THE ENEMY! Pyrrus' biosphere is intentionally attacking the city. Jason shares this information with the grubbers and wins their total support. They ask Jason to go back to civilization and return with a ship. In return they will reward him handsomely. Jason agrees, but only to get back to the city. He knows that though the grubbers would keep their word, the first thing they would get from civilization would be weapons with which to make war on the city. He has a better idea, and shares it with Kerk along with the truth about the attacks. Jason builds a device that can track the intelligence giving commands to the native flora and fauna to attack the city, and puts it in the city's spaceship to search. They detect that the psychic commands emanate from a cave on an island far from the city. Jason prepares to go down and \\"talk\\" to what may be an alien intelligence, but the junkmen decide instead to attack and kill the intelligence. The resulting battle ends with hundreds dead, along with the intelligence after the entire island is destroyed in a nuclear blast. However, the attacks on the city grow even worse than before. Kerk blames Jason for the loss of the attack team (although the order to attack was given by him) and the futility of the plan and prepares to kill him. Jason is barely able to flee in an escape pod, but it is shot down by Kerk. Jason crashes into the jungle and is stricken with a Pyrran infection. He awakens in the grubber village. The grubbers witnessed his escape and killed a junkman for his medkit to treat Jason. Then the village's \\"quakeman\\", who is precognitive, warns of an impending quake. The grubbers put Jason on a stretcher and follow the quakeman as he runs from the village, accompanied by just about every animal in the area. A tectonic event hits the village, flattening it. The animals flee together, without attacking each other. Jason realizes the nature of the conflict. But he needs to tell everyone‚Äîgrubbers and junkmen‚Äîat the same time. He plans an attack on the city, based heavily on the talkers. By stirring up an animal attack on the city opposite the spaceport they easily take the spaceship, and therefore the city. Jason is thus able to get the grubbers and junkmen into a room without them killing each other. Jason now reveals all. Although all life on Pyrrus competes for survival individually, they react collectively to natural disasters. The grubbers, with the assistance of their talkers, have integrated themselves peacefully into the planet's ecosystem, killing only for food or in self-defense. The junkmen, however, think only of killing, and kill everything they can simply because they can. The animals and plants band together against the common threat and cooperate in trying to eliminate them, mutating to better kill humans. Jason proves this to the junkmen, first by having the grubbers safely handle one of the city's ultralethal species, then doing it himself. The city's science director pretends he is handling a training aid, and is able to do the same. With this knowledge and the cooperation of both Pyrran communities, Jason offers a solution. As the prejudices between the two cultures are generations old, the two communities cannot simply merge. Instead, select junkmen will live among the grubbers to learn their methods of coexistence, and in exchange selected grubbers will be given transport on the city's only spaceship to restore their connection with the rest of humanity. Trade will be continued fairly, with the grubbers trading food and ore to the city Pyrrans for technology and medicines. The educational system will be completely redesigned around grubber survival techniques, after which the city's children will live in new lodgings outside the besieged city‚Äîwhich will remain home to those who cannot adapt to the wilds of Pyrrus. Though the city will inevitably fall to the onslaught, those who have adapted will no longer be grubbers or junkmen, but simply Pyrrans. Kerk and the leader of the grubbers make peace. The junkmen who are unable to adapt need not die with the city. There are many worlds of great value that are too harsh for normal humans to colonize. However, Pyrrans can survive where others cannot. Deathworld 2 In Deathworld 2, Jason is kidnapped by the self-righteous Mikah, who is determined to bring him back to the planet Cassylia, ostensibly to be tried for his various crimes but really (Cassylia does not want Jason returned, since his huge winnings have been spent and the planet has used the incident to promote the \\"honesty\\" of its casino) to help Mikah's movement to overthrow the government, which they consider corrupt. Jason forces a crash-landing on a planet where the human population has regressed. The technology is extremely primitive and knowledge is split up among many small clans, each one jealously monopolizing what it knows. Jason uses his ingenuity to survive, trading his knowledge for protection and power in one of these clans. He eventually allies with a clan which has the knowledge of electricity. He creates innovations and machinery for the clan, in the process devising a crude device that signals his location to a spaceship piloted by his Pyrran girlfriend, Meta. Deathworld 3 In Deathworld 3, Jason invites those Pyrrans who cannot adapt to the changes on their home world to colonize \\"Felicity\\", a planet rich in mineral wealth, but home to humans who are divided into two primitive societies, reminiscent of early Asia. One is an agrarian society living in towns and cities; the other is composed of nomadic clans that constantly fight amongst each other, strongly reminiscent of the Mongols before they invaded China and settled down. The two are divided by an impassible, miles-high, continent-spanning cliff. Most of the warlike clans have recently been united under a wily leader calling himself Temujin. Jason tries to infiltrate the warrior society and use his Pyrrans to wrestle the leadership of the clans away from Temujin, but is unmasked as an off-worlder and thrown down a deep cave. He survives the fall, landing in a bank of snow and finds that it is a passageway through the cliff. Jason changes his plans and contacts Temujin, who takes him for an unkillable demon. Jason offers the barbarian leader his greatest wish, to conquer the rest of the continent. Temujin does indeed prove unstoppable, but is perceptive enough to realize, at the peak of his triumph, that he has to pay an enormous price for what he has won, as his people are becoming corrupted by the easy life of civilisation and will forget their nomadic ways. Continuations  \\"The Mothballed Spaceship\\" In \\"The Mothballed Spaceship\\", a hostile armada is heading towards Earth, and its government contracts Jason and the Pyrrans to reactivate an ancient mothballed battleship. It is cheaper to use the battleship, a relic from the First Galactic War, than it is to build a fleet from scratch. Unfortunately, when the ship was deactivated for storage, or \\"mothballed\\", it was programmed to destroy any approaching object so it could not be stolen by Earth's enemies. The only way it can be used is if it receives the correct codeword. The armada is just weeks away, so Jason and Kerk must race against time to enter the ship. Jason approaches the problem with intelligence and guile, and is able to board it with plenty of time to spare. Kerk's Pyrran combat skills then make short work of the ship's on-board defenses. But when they reach the control center, the computer starts a self-destruct sequence‚Äîa final option to keep the ship from being \\"stolen\\". Just in time, Jason's Pyrran lover, Meta, discovers the correct codeword, canceling the self-destruct. It turns out to have been a simple five-letter word in Esperanto: \\"Haltu\\" or, \\"Stop\\". This short story was featured in Astounding: The John W. Campbell Memorial Anthology which was published after the death of the famed, influential editor. Return to Deathworld The Return to Deathworld series is a collaboration between Harry Harrison and Russian authors Ant Skalandis and Mikhail Akhmanov and has never been published in English. The exact share of Harrison's participation is unclear, as Skalandis has also written several sequels to late Edmond Hamilton's books, and they were published in Russian under both their names. These are: *–í–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –ú–∏—Ä —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ (Return to Deathworld. 1998) by Harrison and Skalandis *–ú–∏—Ä —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ —Ñ–ª–∏–±—É—Å—Ç—å–µ—Ä–æ–≤ (Deathworld vs. Filibusters, 1998) by Harrison and Skalandis *–ú–∏—Ä —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ –∏ —Ç–≤–∞—Ä–∏ –∏–∑ –ø—Ä–µ–∏—Å–ø–æ–¥–Ω–µ–π (The Creatures from Hell, 1999) by Harrison and Skalandis *–ú–∏—Ä —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏. –ù–µ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∏ –ø–æ —Ä–∞–∑—É–º—É (Foes in Intelligence, also known as Deathworld 7, 2001) by Harrison & Akhmanov In Return to Deathworld, a strange planetoid is detected heading for a densely populated star cluster. Anybody who looks at it or a recording of it is overcome by irrational fear. The collective governing body of the cluster hires the Pyrrans to investigate and, if the planetoid is dangerous, destroy it. Things get complicated when the planetoid is discovered to arrive from another universe with different physical laws (e.g. œÄ is exactly 2) and Jason and Meta get kidnapped by the insane master in control of the thing. The second part of Return to Deathworld describes Jason's adventures at the galactic core, strangely mirroring the ancient myth of the Argonauts (including the fact that the hero is named Jason and the battleship's new name is Argo). In fact, Jason recognizes the parallel and attempts to alter the outcome. In Deathworld vs. Filibusters, the remains of the defeated armada (mentioned in \\"The Mothballed Spaceship\\") turn to piracy under the leadership of one Henry Morgan. Jason dinAlt is hired by the same casino he won a fortune from at the start of the series to steal back the money Morgan took from the casino. Jason's plan fails when he and Meta are captured by Morgan's men and taken to their hidden planet. In no time, Jason makes up another daring plan‚Äîlead the pirates to Pyrrus for a pirate-Pyrran face-off. In The Creatures from Hell, strange eruptions occur all over a semi- backward planet. Unknown creatures are seen rising from the lava. As usual, the planetary authorities turn to Pyrrus for help. As the Pyrrans begin to investigate, the truth is revealed about the rulers of the planet and the crops they are growing there. In Foes in Intelligence, super-titled Deathworld 7, the Roog civilization plans to invade Pyrrus. In order to ensure the success of the operation, they decide to kidnap one of the Pyrran leaders for study. As luck would have it, instead of their original target (Kerk Pyrrus), the Roogs kidnap Jason dinAlt‚Äîthe only Pyrran who would even think of trying to convince the captors that \\"trade is better than war\\". Notes There are a great many similarities between the hero of this series, Jason DinAlt, and the more famous 'Slippery Jim' DiGriz of Harrison's 'Stainless Steel Rat' series, leading many fans of Harrison's work to consider Deathworld as a 'trial run' of the Stainless Steel Rat character, testing out what aspects of the intended hero work and what do not. Many of DinAlt's attitudes and beliefs are almost identical to DiGriz's and they share a few catchphrases as well.

Clonaslee is approximately 100 km west of Dublin, and is close to the towns of Portlaoise and Tullamore. As of the 2016 census, the village had a recorded population of 566. Name The primary spelling of the name, Clonaslee, is associated by several sources to the Irish Cluain na Sl√≠ (translated as \\"pasture of the way\\" or \\"roadside meadow\\" or similar) and related to the village's location on ancient cross- country route. Though this is the commonly and officially accepted version, an alternative spelling of the name, Cloneslieu, is associated by some sources to the Irish Cluain na Sl√©ibhe (translated as \\"the mountain meadow\\"). The original name of the parish, Kilmanman, from the Irish Cill na mBanbh√°n or Cill Mheanman (translated as \\"the church of Manman\\"), is associated with Saint Manman who founded a church here in the 7th century. History While earlier archaeological remains suggest more ancient settlement in the area (including a ringfort in nearby Larragan townland), the modern day Clonaslee evolved from its beginnings as an Anglo-Norman town of the late-12th century. At this time the eskers and related landforms gave a great strategic advantage by providing ideal vantage points where mottes and other defensive battlements were constructed. This advantage also had a profound influence on the location of towns and villages throughout the county. From the 12th to 17th centuries, recorded history does not provide much detail on the development of Clonaslee. The most significant period in the village's growth took place from the 16th century under the influence of the Dunnes of Brittas. This family left their mark on the form and history of the village as evidenced in its planned form and also from a number of ruins in the area. The former residence of a young branch of the family remains in ruins one mile from the village at Clara Hill. Also, near the east bank of the Clodiagh River stand the ruins of Ballinakill Castle, built in 1680 by Colonel Dunne. Throughout the 18th century, Clonaslee prospered due to its location on an important highway across Laois leading onto Munster. The proximity of Brittas - the seat of the Dunnes - was also influential as the power of this family had by now grown beyond that of a native Irish Chieftain. In 1771, Francis Dunne, then head of the Dunne Family, became a Roman Catholic and built a thatched parish chapel in the village. This was located close to the site of the present church. The Dunne family continued to finance the construction of landmark buildings in the village. The parish Church was erected in 1814 under General Dunne (known locally as 'shun-battle Ned' because of his rumoured refusal to fight at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo). The construction of the Church was aided by a gift of ¬£800 and a loan of ¬£300 from the former Board of First Fruit. In 1830, the same board donated ¬£50 towards the construction of Glebe House. The village continued to grow quickly from the 1800s to the 1830s. This was largely due to the development of the Mountmellick to Birr road in 1814. This period also saw the arrival of civic facilities such as the Post Office, the Police Station and other offices of Civil Administration. The population of the village peaked at 561 inhabitants in 1841. However, in 1901 this fell to a low of 287 persons. As of the 2016 census, the recorded population was 566. Amenities Local walks and trails include Slieve Bloom Forest Park, the Giant's Grave, and Brittas Lake and Forest - the latter of which is managed by Coillte. The ruined tower of Brittas Castle, largely destroyed by fire in the mid-20th century, has a gateway from Clonaslee's main street. Clonaslee-St.Manmans is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.

History  The club announced they would be installing a 3G all-weather pitch for the 2017/18 season. Carmarthen Town began the season with a number of games away from their Richmond Park home due these pitch renovations. With the new pitch the 'Old Gold' joined a growing list of Welsh Premier League clubs to install a 3G/4G pitch. Richmond Park has been used for a number of International football matches. The majority of these have featured Wales national football team sides. The first match was against Scotland on 20 May 2003 which ended in a 2‚Äì1 victory for Wales.  Records  The highest attendance recorded at Richmond Park is 911, for Carmarthen's League of Wales match against Barry Town, on 10 September 1997.

This species typically reaches only in length, although some are as long as . The back is generally a dark olive green, while the sides are silvery, with a dark line extending from gill cover to tail, and a scattering of dark melanophores. The fins are colorless, with more melanophores on the rays of the dorsal fin and tail, as well as on the first four rays of the pectoral fins. Similar in many ways to the Alvord chub, the Borax Lake species has a longer, wider, and deeper head, and larger eyes, and the caudal peduncle is more slender. Aerial photo of Borax Lake in Eastern Oregon The Borax Lake chub eats a variety of foods, including midge larvae, diatoms, copepods, ostracods, and terrestrial insects. Its preferred mode of feeding is to root around in the bottom, but it will go after floating material or feed from the surface if necessary. This species is the sole fish inhabiting the Borax Lake waters. While parts of the lake itself can, at times, rise to about fed from thermal springs, the average temperature ranges between . The fish avoid the warmest water, favoring lake's outflows. Its continued existence was threatened by geothermal energy development near the lake, which dried up part of the chub's habitat. However, in 2000 the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act put the area around the lake off-limits to geothermal exploration and mining.

It was a trout-sized detritivorous fish that lived in estuaries of the early Devonian. Description Like its relatives, Cephalaspis was heavily armored, presumedly to defend against predatory placoderms and eurypterids, as well as to serve as a source of calcium for metabolic functions in calcium-poor freshwater environments. It had sensory patches along the rim and center of its head shield, which were used to sense for worms and other burrowing organisms in the mud. Diet Because its mouth was situated directly beneath its head, Cephalaspis was thought of as being a bottom-feeder, akin to a heavily armoured catfish or sturgeon. It moved its plow-like head from side to side, Cephalaspis easily stirring sand and dust into the water, along with revealing the hiding places of its prey, digging up worms or crustaceans hidden in the mud and algae, as well as sifting through detritus (inferred from its lack of jaws and inability to bite). Classification The genus Cephalaspis has long been used as a wastebasket taxon since Agassiz erected it in 1835 for four species, C. lyelli, C. rostratus, C. lewisi and C. lloydi.White, E. I. \\"On Cephalaspis lyelli Agassiz.\\" Palaeontology 1.2 (1958): 99-105. Later, it was eventually determined that the last three species were portions of what would eventually be described as the heterostracan Pteraspis rostratus. C. lyelli, named after Sir Charles Lyell, would be left to be the type species of the genus. Other researchers would continue adding other similar-looking osteostracans throughout the decades until, in 2009, Sansom reevaluated Osteostraci, and determined that only C. lyelli could be reliably placed within Cephalaspis, and that probably all other species would eventually need to be reexamined and be placed into other genera.Sansom, Robert S. \\"Phylogeny, classification and character polarity of the Osteostraci (Vertebrata).\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 7.1 (2009): 95-115. In the same 2009 study, Sansom also determined that Cephalaspis sensu stricto was the sister-taxon of cornuate osteostracans, i.e., all osteostracans that either have, or have ancestors that had defined corners on the head-shields.

The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Durand Line border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular the Waziristan region and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct low-intensity warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO allies, as well as against civilian targets. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups. The leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akhundzada, who heads the Quetta Shura. The allied Haqqani Network, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and smaller al-Qaeda groups have also been part of the insurgency.Our Man in Kabul? by Michael Crowley, tnr.com, 9 March 2010 Background Following the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan. In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. Small mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. In late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against \\"America and its puppets\\" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to \\"regain the sovereignty of our country\\". While The Taliban spent several years regrouping, they launched a re-escalation of the insurgency campaign in 2006. Organization As of 2017, the Taliban was composed of four different shuras, or representative councils. The first is the Quetta Shura. Two smaller shuras are subordinated to it, the Haqqani network (also known as the Miran Shah Shura) and the Peshawar Shura. The Pehsawar Shura was established in March 2005, and is based in eastern Afghanistan. The majority of its fighters are former members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin.Giustozzi 2019, p. 88. The Haqqani network declared its autonomy from the Quetta Shura in 2007, and rejoined in August 2015. The Peshawar Shura was autonomous from 2009 until 2016.Giustozzi 2017, p. 9. The second autonomous shura is the Shura of the North, based in Badakhshan Province. The third is the Mashhad Shura, sponsored by Iran, and the fourth is the Rasool Shura, led by Muhammad Rasul and also known as the High Council of the Islamic Emirate. 2001-2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period Map detailing the spread of the Taliban- insurgency in Afghanistan 2002‚Äì2006 Following the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, The Taliban were defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan, where they began the initial stages of re-grouping. Stephen Tanner, Afghanistan: A Military History, Page 317 Pamphlets by Taliban and other groups turned up strewn in towns and the countryside in early 2003, urging Islamic faithful to rise up against U.S. forces and other foreign soldiers in holy war. On 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose (War in Afghanistan), a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex north of Spin Boldak. Eighteen rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time. In May 2003, the Taliban Supreme Court's chief justice, Abdul Salam, proclaimed that the Taliban were back, regrouped, rearmed, and ready for guerrilla war to expel U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. Small mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. As the summer of 2003 continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. Operation Valiant Strike was a major United States military ground operation in Afghanistan announced on 19 March 2003 that involved 2nd and 3rd battalions of 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Romanian and Afghan troops. The combined forces moved through Kandahar and parts of Southern Afghanistan with the objective of eliminating Taliban enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. At the conclusion of the operation on 24 March 2003, coalition forces had detained 13 suspected Taliban fighters and confiscated more than 170 rocket-propelled grenades, 180 land mines, 20 automatic rifles and machine guns, as well as many rockets, rifles, and launchers. United States led- coalition forces carried out Operation Asbury Park on June 2, 2004, and June 17, 2004, of taskforce 1/6 BLT of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit engaged in fighting with Taliban and other anti-coalition forces in both Oruzgan Province and Zabul Province culminating in the Dai Chopan region of Afghanistan. This operation was characterized by atypical fighting on the side of the tactics of the Taliban and the other guerillas encountered.Asbury Park culminating in a large battle on June 8. During Asbury Park, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit was faced with an opponent that frequently would dig in and engage the Marine forces, rather than the traditional hit and run (or \\"asymmetric attack\\") methods. As such, Marines, with the aid of B-1B Lancer, A-10 Warthog, and AH-64 Apache aircraft, engaged in \\"pitched battles each day,\\"Asbury Park culminating in a large battle on June 8. The last of the fighting which took place near Dai Chopan on June 8 was decisive in that enemy forces were depleted to such an extent that no further contact was made with the enemy for the duration of the operation. What was meant by the enemy to be a three pronged attack June 8, 2004 resulted in over eighty-five confirmed kills, with estimates well in excess of 100 enemy dead, an estimated 200-300 wounded, with dozens captured. While throughout the entire operation a \\"handful\\" of US forces and Afghan Militia were injured. In late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against \\"America and its puppets\\" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to \\"regain the sovereignty of our country\\". In late June through mid-July 2005, United States Navy Seals carried out Operation Red Wings as a combined / joint military operation in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar, approximately west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005. At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation. In between August 13 and August 18 2005, United States Marine Corps carried out a military operation, called Operation Whalers that took place in Afghanistan's Kunar Province, just weeks after the disastrous Operation Red Wings. Like Operation Red Wings, the objective of Operation Whalers was the disruption of Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the region in support of further stabilizing the region for unencumbered voter turnout for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Operation Whalers was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3). The emphasis of the operation was an Anti-Coalition Militia cell led by Ahmad Shah, which was one of 22 identified ACM groups operating in the region at that time, and was the most active. Ahmad Shah's cell was responsible for the Navy SEAL ambush and subsequent MH-47 shootdown that killed, in total, 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings. Operation Whalers, named after the Hartford / New England Whalers professional hockey team, was the \\"sequel\\" to Operation Red Wings in that it was aimed at furthering stabilization of the security situation in the restive Kunar Province of Eastern Afghanistan, a long-term goal of American and coalition forces operating in the area at that time. Operation Whalers, conducted by a number of Marine infantry companies of 2/3 with attached Afghan National Army soldiers and supported by conventional Army aviation, intelligence, and combat arms forces units and U.S. Air Force aviation assets, proved a success. Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia activity dropped substantially and subsequent human intelligence and signals intelligence revealed that Ahmad Shah had been seriously wounded. Shah, who sought to disrupt the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections, was not able to undertake any significant Taliban Anti-Coalition operations subsequent to Operation Whalers in Kunar or neighboring provinces. 2006 escalation In 2006, Afghanistan began facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006. Afghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said: Insurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have \\"sharply escalated in 2006\\" with \\"at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects.\\"The Consequences of Insurgent Attacks in Afghanistan April 2007 Volume 19, No. 6(C) 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded).Afghanistan\`s record of suicide attacks in 2006 Paktribune.com quoting \\"A well-calculated survey by Pajhwok Afghan News\\".

In the meantime the Taliban insurgency spread to the northern provinces of the country. The new policy of the Taliban was to shift militants from the south to the north, to show they exist \\"everywhere\\", according to Faryab Province Governor Abdul Haq Shafaq. With most Afghan and NATO troops stationed in the southern and eastern provinces, villagers in the once-peaceful north found themselves confronted with a rapid deterioration of security, as insurgents seized new territory in provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, and even infiltrated the mountains of Badakhshan Province in the northeast.

A government official said that the victims were beheaded for celebrating with music and mixgender dancing in the Musa Qala district of Helmand, which ran contrary to the Taliban's extreme brand of Islam. Later, however, a provincial government official said that the 17 people killed were due to a fight between two Taliban commanders over two women (who were also killed). The civilians were either beheaded or had their throats cut, but some showed signs of gunshot wounds or beatings. ****The attacks were condemned by Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who ordered an investigation into the attack, the leader of the NATO coalition led by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union.

Timeline * July ** 25 July *** Afghan insurgents killed 17 Shia civilians travelling from Kabul. ** 13 July Assassination of Atiqullah Raufi.  2015  2015 saw the Taliban make various gains in Afghanistan in an attempt to fracture the fledgling Afghan government with successes not seen since NATO intervened in 2001. The Taliban has increased suicide attacks and has made multiple territorial gains across the country.  Kunduz Offensive  Beginning in April, the Taliban fought for the city of Kunduz in the northern Kunduz Province with them capturing the city by September. Afghan Armed Forces recaptured the city in October but local sources dispute this claim. The quick fall of the city resulted in calls by some government officials for President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah to resign.  Helmand Offensive  In December, the Taliban made more territorial gains by besieging Afghan forces in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Sangin and outlying towns in the Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan. By late December, most of Sangin was captured by the Taliban with local Afghan forces surrounded and forced to rely on airlifts for ammunition and food.  Effects  The gains made by the Taliban have hampered peace talks between them and the government and made rifts appear in the Taliban over negotiations. In response to the new offensives, it was reported that the United States would slow down their withdrawal of troops to help in counter-insurgency operations.  2016  Find information on this subject in: War in Afghanistan (2015‚Äìpresent)#2016, like: * 14 April: Taliban attacking Kunduz; * 31 May: kidnapping a bus with 220 people, killing 10; * 1 June storming a court in Ghazni, 5 dead Taliban and 5 dead others; * June: Taliban have 25,000 fighters in Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan, according to US sources; * 18 July attacking Qalai Zal, unsuccessfully; * July: 20% of Afghanistan is in Taliban hands, said Time magazine; * December: Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan, said the US military.  2017  Find information on this subject in: War in Afghanistan (2015‚Äìpresent)#2017  2018  See War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent)  2019  See War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Throughout most of the year, the US government maintained high-level talks with the Taliban, in an effort to secure a peace deal with the insurgency. However, a suicide bombing in Kabul on 7 September 2019 which killed 11 people and one American soldier prompted the US President to break-off peace talks with the Taliban. In mid September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that the Taliban had suffered more than 1,000 war casualties in the space of only one week since the US broke off peace negotiations with the Taliban.  2020  On 29 February, the United- States reached an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, in Doha, Qatar. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. and allied troops over the next 14 months, on the condition that the Taliban continues with the peace process. The first withdrawal, of around 5,000 personnel, will occur within the next 135 days. The peace deal stipulates that the Taliban not allow terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda ‚Äúto use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.‚Äù If successful, the peace deal will bring an end to 18-years of conflict. Only days after signing the historic deal, US forces conducted airstrikes on Taliban soldiers as a \\"defensive\\" measure, as Taliban fighters were \\"actively attacking\\" an Afghan government checkpoint. On 2 May, the US revealed that the agreement included an informal commitment for both sides to cut violence by 80%. Since the agreement was signed, attacks on cities and coalition forces had decreased, but overall attacks had increased 70% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Reuters. The Taliban claim that attacks have fallen since the agreement was signed. On 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians in Gardez, Paktia Province. On 18 May, the Taliban killed nine people in a similar attack in Ghazni Province. On May 29, 2020, it was revealed that numerous Taliban and Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network leaders were infected with COVID-19. This resulted in the late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar's son Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob being made the entire organization's acting leader.https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/29/taliban-leadership-disarray- coronavirus-covid-peace-talks/ Finances While the pre-2001 Taliban suppressed opium production, the current insurgency \\"relies on opium revenues to purchase weapons, train its members, and buy support.\\" In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium. Today it produces 93% of the global crop, and the drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP.Gretchen Peters \\"Seeds of Terror: How Heroin is Bankrolling the Taliban and Al Qaeda\\", publ. Thomas Dunne Books (2009) On 28 July 2009, Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that money transfers from Western Europe and the Gulf States exceeded the drug trade earnings and that a new task force had been formed to shut down this source of funds. The United States Agency for International Development is investigating the possibility that kickbacks from its contracts are being funneled to the Taliban. A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the Taliban on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author Matt Waldman spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realized. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura.\\"Pakistan puppet masters guide the Taliban killers\\" A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as \\"malicious\\".

It is primarily used as a football ground and is the home of Llanelli Town A.F.C.. It was also used for athletics and Llanelli Amateur Athletic Club (Llanelli AAC) were based at the stadium. It is owned by Llanelli Town Council. From 2015 Raiders RL club used the stadium for their debut season in the Conference League South but are now based at the park on a permanent basis as they compete in the RFL professional tier as the only professional Rugby League team in South Wales. History Stebonheath Park has been used as a football ground since 1920. It almost hosted League football in the 1930s but the club lost out coming second in the vote. At the time the ground had a large wooden grandstand, a covered end terrace and a large bank on the south side, and it could easily have been developed into a Third Division ground. The stand was subsequently demolished and the ground re-shaped to allow the building of an adjacent by-pass road. Stebonheath Park was home to the Wales national rugby league team in the 1930s. Here Wales were crowned European Champions, after defeating England 17‚Äì9, on 10 November 1938. Frank Whitcombe made his debut for Wales in this game. The stadium has been owned by Llanelli Town Council since 1977. The council undertook major redevelopments of the stadium which included floodlighting, a new 700 seater main stand, new terracing, a function room social club as well as all-weather training facilities for the athletics club. In July 2008, a new open seated stand was built on existing terracing along one side of the ground with about 300 seats. Around the pitch is a narrow 400 metre running track with four lanes on each straight. It is the narrowest 400m track in the United Kingdom. On 28 February 2006 the stadium hosted an international match between Wales Under-21s and Northern Ireland Under-21s, with the Northern Irish side winning 1‚Äì0. Local junior football finals are held at the stadium. The Welsh Cup Final has been staged at the stadium including the 2002‚Äì03 season final between Barry Town and Cwmbran Town as well as the 2004‚Äì05 final between Total Network Solutions and Carmarthen Town. On 6 May 2007 Stebonheath Park staged the 120th Welsh Cup final between Carmarthen Town and Afan Lido. On 31 October 2008 the stadium hosted a Victory Shield match between Wales under-16 and England under-16 which was shown live on Sky Sports. In 2016 it held a 2017 Rugby League World Cup Qualifier between Wales and Serbia. Llanelli AFC Although the stadium was the home of Llanelli AFC, they used to play major games at Stradey Park which had a capacity of 10,800. Stradey Park was demolished in late 2008 and an option for major games was the then newly built 14,340 capacity Parc y Scarlets. The new open seated stand at Stebonheath Park enabled Llanelli to host European matches, the first being a UEFA Champions League qualifier against Latvian club FK Ventspils in July 2008. Llanelli AAC Lanelli AAC, which was formed in 1978, is based at the stadium and caters for all standards of track and field athletics, cross-country running and road running. Raiders RL West Wales Raiders RL relocated to Llanelli in 2014 and struck up a deal to play at the stadium with the local council in preparation for the debut season in the Conference league south where they finished 3rd. The West Wales Raiders Rugby League Club previously known as Raiders RL are the most established Rugby league club[1] in West Wales formed in January 2015.[2] Formerly called Gwendreath Valley Raiders they moved to Llanelli when the club gained entry into the Conference League South which is level 4 of the Rugby League system. In 2017, Andrew Thorne purchased the semi professional League 1 club South Wales Ironmen, relocating the club immediately to Llanelli. The Ironmen will rebrand as West Wales Raiders from 2018 onwards. They also have links with one of the oldest university rugby league teams in Wales the Warpigs from Swansea University. The raiders have taken over the running and coaching of the university rugby league team since 2017. The Raiders first ever match was an away friendly against Aberystwyth University in February which they won 72‚Äì6. Their first league match was a home derby win against the defending champions Valley Cougars 34‚Äì6, captain Alan Pope scoring the club's first try. The game was watched by over 370 spectators. Records The record attendance for football at Stebonheath Park is 1,410 for a Welsh Premier League football match between Llanelli and Barry Town on 14 January 2000. The biggest ever crowd at Stebonheath Park was for a Rugby League match on 23 November 1935 where Wales beat France in front of a crowd of over 25,000 fans.

It is currently used for football matches and is the home ground of Newtown F.C.. The stadium holds 5,000 people and is named after former Wales international footballer George Latham. Over the years the club have played at a number of sites but the officers and general committee of the late 1940s took the decision to purchase and construct a new playing headquarters at a site to be called Latham Park. This decision was a far-sighted one, and the present board officers, committee, supporters and players owe much to their counterparts of some 60 years ago. The Control Techniques stand has 420 covered seats with dressing rooms for the club and the community use. A further stand has been constructed at the Llanidloes Road \\"Allotment End\\" side of the ground and the old \\"Shed\\" stand has been improved with new seating as well as new dug out facilities. The function room and social club has also seen a new extension built on to the club house. During the 2004/05 season the clubhouse was extended with the building of a new function room with a 200 capacity. This coupled with upgrading of the floodlights and a new pitch drainage system resulted in a football ground with social facilities to equal any club in non- league football. The most recent addition in October 2009 is a new media room with balcony which also acts as an exclusive sponsors lounge on club match days. In early 2004, the club was awarded the UEFA Licence, the first Welsh Premier club to receive this licence. During the last 11 years, the club have hosted not only their own UEFA cup ties against Skonto Riga (1996) and Wisla Krak√≥w (1998) but a host of other games including U21 Internationals, full ladies Internationals, Champions League and UEFA ties for other Welsh Premier Clubs as well as full U15 and U18 Internationals. The Welsh Cup final has been hosted on two occasions at the ground and the Welsh League Cup final eight times. The ground is currently sponsored by Paveways and is known as Paveways Latham Park.

History  Llansantffriad F.C., which later became Total Network Solutions used the Recreation Ground as their home ground since 1959, though it had been used as the centre of football in Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain prior to this. Up until 1990, the Recreation Ground had no stands or clubhouse, which required players to change in a nearby pub. Being a recreation ground, it was also used to graze cows requiring clearing of cow dung before each match. They also used to play in the Welsh Premier League. In 2003, Total Network Solutions merged with Oswestry Town F.C. with the agreement that the majority of matches would be played at the Recreation Ground. In 2005, it was announced that Total Network Solutions, later renamed The New Saints, would leave the Recreation Ground and move to Oswestry Town's old Park Hall ground in England following redevelopment. The move was made because The New Saints were unable to improve the Recreation Ground to bring it up to UEFA standards for European competition as it was a council owned recreation ground. This came after Total Network Solutions were obliged to move their UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool F.C. to Wrexham's Racecourse Ground because the Recreation Ground was not big enough to meet UEFA standards. Despite The New Saints leaving the Recreation Ground, chairman Mike Harris stated following the purchase of Total Network Solutions by British Telecom, that he still intended for The New Saints to run the Recreation Ground. As a result, the Recreation Ground was still used by The New Saints' youth teams. This was a reversal of the original situation following the merger of Total Network Solutions and Oswestry Town whereby the first team played at the Recreation Ground while the club's reserve, youth and ladies teams played at Park Hall. In 2007, the Recreation Ground was proposed by The New Saints as a potential venue for the FAW Premier Cup final after they opposed the selection of their final opponent Newport County A.F.C.'s Rodney Parade being selected as the venue when they expected a neutral venue. However the Football Association of Wales rejected this as BBC Wales had requested it and the Recreation Ground \\"was not considered suitable and did not have the infrastructure required\\". As a result of The New Saints moving to Oswestry, a number of Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain residents broke away from The New Saints to form Llansantffraid Village F.C. because of The New Saints were no longer playing regularly in the village and because most of the youth team's players were not from Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain. Llansantffraid Village then started to use the Recreation Ground for their matches in the Montgomeryshire Football League. Following this, the Recreation Ground became viewed as a public youth club. The Recreation Ground later became a target for vandalism with one occasion, vandals threw used nappies on the pitch and a fifth of the Recreation Ground's bucket seats were damaged. Attendance The highest attendance recorded at the Recreation Ground was 1,996 for a pre- season friendly between The New Saints F.C. (then known as \\"Total Network Solutions\\") and Chelsea F.C. on 9 August 2002. The Recreation Ground's record attendance in the league stands at 1,042, set at a Welsh Premier League game between The New Saints and Rhyl F.C. on 23 January 2005.

Words deemed obscene were described as obsc(a)ena (obscene, lewd, unfit for public use), or (improper, in poor taste, undignified). Documented obscenities occurred rarely in classical Latin literature, limited to certain types of writing such as epigrams, but they are commonly used in the graffiti written on the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Among the documents of interest in this area is a letter written by Cicero in 45 BC (ad Fam. 9.22) to a friend called Paetus, in which he alludes to a number of obscene words without actually naming them. Apart from graffiti, the writers who used obscene words most were Catullus and Martial in their shorter poems. Another source is the anonymous Priapeia (see External links below), a collection of 95 epigrams supposedly written to adorn statues of the fertility god Priapus, whose wooden image was customarily set up to protect orchards against thieves. The earlier poems of Horace also contained some obscenities. However, the satirists Persius and Juvenal, although often describing obscene acts, did so without mentioning the obscene words. Medical, especially veterinary, texts also use certain anatomical words that, outside of their technical context, might have been considered obscene. Latin taboo words Cicero's letter ad Fam. 9.22 In a letter to one of his friends, written about 45 BC, Cicero discusses a number of obscenities in Latin. 9.22. It appears that the friend, Lucius Papirius Paetus, (whose letters to Cicero have not been preserved) had used the word (\\"penis\\") in one of his letters. Cicero praises him for his forthrightness, which he says conforms to the teachings of the Stoic philosophers, but says that he himself prefers modesty (). In the letter Cicero alludes to a number of obscene words, without actually mentioning them. The words which he alludes to but avoids are: (\\"arsehole\\"), (\\"penis\\"), (\\"cunt\\"), (\\"clitoris\\"), and (\\"testicles\\"). He also objects to words which mean \\"to fuck\\", as well as to the Latin word \\"two\\" because for bilingual speakers it sounds like the Greek () (\\"he fucks or sodomises\\"Bain (1991).), and also to two words for passing wind, and . He does not object to using the word , and says that , which in his day was obscene, was formerly just a euphemism meaning \\"tail\\". Degrees of obscenity There thus appear to have been various degrees of obscenity in Latin, with words for anything to do with sex in the most obscene category. These words are strictly avoided in most types of Latin literature; however, they are common in graffiti, and also in certain genres of poetry, such as the short poems known as epigrams, such as those written by Catullus and Martial.Adams (1982), p. 2. The poet Horace also used obscenities in his early poems, that is the Epodes and the first book of Satires, but later writers of satire such as Juvenal and Persius avoided the coarser words even when discussing obscene topics. There were, however, some occasions in public life, such as in triumphal processions, at weddings, and at certain festivals, where obscenities were traditionally allowed. The purpose of these was presumably twofold, first to ward off the evil eye or potential envy of the gods, and second to promote fertility.Adams (1982), pp. 4‚Äì6. Euphemistic expressions A very common way of avoiding words for sexual acts was simply to omit the word in question. J.N. Adams collects numerous examples of this.Adams (1981a). For example, in Horace (Epodes 12.15): : ::(\\"You are capable of [having sex with] Inachia three times in a night.\\") Another way was to substitute the taboo word with a milder one or a metaphor, for example using (\\"rump (of an animal)\\") for or for . Sometimes the offending word was replaced by a pronoun such as (\\"that\\") or an adverb such as (\\"there\\"), as in Martial (11.104.16): : ::(\\"And when the Ithacan was snoring, modest though she was, Penelope always kept her hand there.\\")  and : the penis   is the basic Latin word for penis. It is used 48 times in Martial, 26 times in the Priapeia, and 18 times in Pompeian inscriptions.Adams (1982), pp. 10, 12. Its status as a basic obscenity is confirmed by the Priapeia 29, in which and are given as ideal examples of obscene words:Adams (1982), p. 9. : :: (\\"May I die if it doesn't shame me to use obscene and improper words; but when you, Priapus, as a god, shamelessly show me your balls hanging out, it is appropriate for me to speak of cunts and cocks.\\") Martial mocks a friend who despised effeminate clothing, explaining why he suspects that he is secretly homosexual: : :: (\\"He will ask why I suspect him to be a 'soft' man. We go to the baths together. He never looks at anything above, but examines the athletesOn draucƒ´, see Taylor (1997), pp. 366-9. with devouring eyes, and looks at their penises with motions of his lips.\\" also frequently appears in the poetry of Catullus. He uses as a nickname for Mamurra, as if it were an ordinary name, as in his epigram 105: : :: (\\"That prick tries to climb the Pimpleian mount (of poetry); the Muses drive him out with pitchforks.\\") (Pimpleia was a place in Pieria in northern Greece associated with the Muses (the nine goddesses of poetry and music).)  Etymology  The etymology of is obscure, although outwardly it would appear to be a diminutive of , gen. , the \\"mind\\" (i.e.; \\"the little mind\\"). Cicero's letter 9:22 relates it to , a spearmint stalk. Tucker's Etymological Dictionary of Latin relates it to , \\"to project outwards\\", , \\"chin\\", and , \\"a mountain\\", all of which suggest an Indo-European root *men-. Other hypotheses have also been suggested, though none generally accepted.cf. Messing (1956).  is also a basic Latin obscenity for \\"penis\\", in particular for a penis in an erect state with the glans bare,Adams (1982), p. 13. as in the illustration of the god Mercury below. It was \\"not a neutral technical term, but an emotive and highly offensive word\\" (Adams), used especially in contexts of aggressive homosexual acts rather than mere (\\"fucking\\"). It is found frequently in graffiti of the type (= ) (\\"Whoever reads this, you're a dickhead\\").Adams (1982), p. 124. It is found less frequently in Classical Latin literature, but it does appear in Catullus 28: : :: (\\"O Memmius, while I lay on my back for a long time you fed me good and slow with that entire beam of yours. But as far as I can see, you guys have met with the same fate: for you have been stuffed with a \\"verpa\\" no less large!\\") Catullus is here speaking metaphorically. He complains that when he accompanied Gaius Memmius, the governor of Bithynia (57-56 BC), as part of his entourage, he was not allowed to make money out of the position. From this poem it is clear that Catullus's friends Veranius and Fabullus were kept under an equally close rein when they accompanied Lucius Piso to his province of Macedonia in 57-55 BC.Wheeler, A.L. 1964 [1934]. Catullus and the Traditions of Ancient Poetry, pp. 96, 103. Adams (1982), p. 130. , as a masculine adjective or noun, referred to a man whose was exposed, either by an erection or by circumcision; thus Juvenal (14.100) has : :: (\\"To guide only the circumcised [i.e. Jews] to the fountain that they seek\\"). And in poem 47 Catullus writes: : :: (\\"Did that unsheathed Priapus prefer you guys to my little Veranius and Fabullus?\\") In Martial's time it was a common practice for actors and athletes to be fitted with a (a pin or brooch through their foreskin) to discourage sex and to preserve their voice or strength.Schultheiss et al. (2003). Martial (7.81) mocks one such actor as follows: : ::(\\"Such a big brooch clothes Menophilus's penis that it is enough for all the comic actors in the world. I believed (since we often go to the baths together) that he was anxious to preserve his voice, Flaccus. But one day, while he was wrestling in the middle of the palaestra with everyone watching, the poor man's brooch fell off. He was circumcised!\\")  A third word for \\"penis\\" was (or ). This is very rare and found only in one line of Horace and a fragment of the satirist Lucilius. The passage in Horace (Sat. 1.2.68) is as follows, in which he advises a young man who was beaten up as a result of an affair with the dictator Sulla's daughter: : ::(\\"What if, in the words of his penis, his mind were to say to the man when he sees such troubles: 'What exactly do you want? Do I ever demand a cunt descended from a famous consul or veiled in a fancy gown when my passion grows hot?'\\") And Lucilius says: : ::(\\"But with his left hand as his girlfriend, he wipes away his mutt≈ç's tears.\\")cf. Antonio Varone, Erotica Pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95. The word may be related to the marriage deity Mutunus Tutunus.Adams (1982), p. 62. Although itself is rare, the derivative (\\"well-endowed\\") is found twice in Martial, as at 3.73: : ::(\\"You sleep with well-endowed boys, Phoebus, and the thing that stands up for them does not stand up for you.\\") The derivative is found in Lucilius and in two Pompeian graffiti.Adams (1982), p. 63.  Synonyms and metaphors  The Latin word itself originally meant \\"tail\\". Cicero's , 9.22, observes that originally was an innocuous word, but that the meaning of male sexual organ had become primary by his day. The euphemism is used occasionally by Catullus, Persius, Juvenal, and Martial, and even once by the historian Sallust,Sallust, Catiline 14. who writes that the supporters of the anti-government rebel Catiline included : ::(\\"whatever shameless man, adulterer, or glutton had ruined his ancestral property by hand, stomach, or 'tail'\\") Commenting on this passage, St Augustine notes that Sallust's use of the term in this phrase was not offensive.Adams (1982), p. 36. The word did not survive into Romance, however, and occurs only once in a Pompeian inscription. Juvenal, showing his knack for describing grossly obscene matters without using taboo words, writes as follows in one of his satires (9.43-4): : ::(\\"Or do you think it is an easy or straightforward thing to drive a proper-sized 'tail' inside someone's guts and there bump into yesterday's dinner?\\")\\"proper-sized\\": Miller (1998). Other commentators translate similarly. Mercury was depicted with an enormous penis on this fresco from Pompeii. The obscure word (gen. ) seems to have meant a sexualized caricature with an abnormally large penis, such as the Romans were known to draw. It appears in Catullus 37: : ::(\\"I will draw sopios on the front of the tavern\\") and in a graffito from Pompeii: : ::(\\"whoever drew sopios, let him eat shit!'\\") The grammarian Sacerdos preserves a quotation about Pompey, that says (\\"whoever is not ashamed, and does not blush, is not a man, but a .\\") would appear to describe drawings such as that of the god Mercury in the illustration. The word seems to have been children's slang for the penis; compare English pee-pee. It appears in Martial 11.71: : :: (\\"Natta sucks the pee-pee of his athlete, compared to whom, Priapus is a eunuch.\\") A (the word occurs only in Martial), according to Housman, was a man \\"who performs feats of strength in public\\".Housman (1930). Rabun Taylor disagrees and sees a more as a kind of rent boy who hung around in the baths in search of patrons.Taylor (1997), pp. 366-70. A was an emasculated member of the cult of Cybele; according to Taylor (1997), they had much in common with the hijras of India today.Taylor (1997), pp. 330-37. Another euphemism for the penis was (\\"tail\\"), which occurs twice in Horace,Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. and continues today in the French derivative (\\"tail\\" or \\"penis\\"). In one place in his Satires (Serm. 2.7.50) Horace writes: : ::(\\"Whichever girl receives the blows of my swelling 'tail', or when I'm on my back sexily rides my 'horse' with her buttocks, sends me away neither with a bad reputation nor worried that a richer or more handsome guy might piss in the same place.\\") For the metaphorical use of (\\"to piss\\"), see below. The words (\\"nerve\\" or \\"sinew\\") and or , which meant a phallic image or amulet in the form of a penis, were also sometimes used as euphemisms for the penis.Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. In one of Horace's Epodes (12) a woman boasts of one of her lovers, Coan Amyntas, : ::(\\"on whose indomitable groin a sinew grows, more constant than a new tree clings to the hills.\\") And one of the characters in Petronius's Satyricon, Ascyltus, is described as follows:Williams (2010), p. 97. : ::(\\"For he had a weight on his groins so big that you'd think the man himself was just an appendage of his phallus.\\") Yet another euphemism is or or , which literally means the stem or stalk of a plant (such as a cabbage, onion, or vine). This word was used by the satirist Lucilius and by the medical writer Celsus (6.18.2). In the same passage, Celsus refers to the foreskin as \\"skin\\", and to the glans as \\"acorn\\". Martial also uses the word in an obscene pun (12.75.3): : ::(\\"Secundus has buttocks fed with acorns\\") Erect and flaccid The verb meant \\"to have an erection\\". Suetonius's Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Augustus 69, contains the sentence: : :: (\\"Does it make any difference where or in which woman you get hard?\\") The participle means 'erect'. Martial describes the habit of a certain girl of weighing a lover's penis in her hand (10.55.1): : : :: (\\"Whenever Marulla weighs an erect penis in her fingers...\\") Martial uses the word (\\"a hard one\\") alone to refer to a penis in the following line, mocking a certain Greek philosopher who despite his beard was effeminate (9.47.6): : :: (\\"You enjoy having a hard one in your soft backside\\") Another word for \\"erect\\" was (\\"stretched, extended\\"). Priapus is addressed as tente PriƒÅpe in PriƒÅpeia 81, and as being (\\"heavy with an extended phallus\\") in PriƒÅpeia 79. An \\"erection\\" or \\"impatience to have sex\\" was .Adams (1982), p. 103. Horace (Sat. 1.2.116-8) writes: :... ::(\\"When your groin swells up, then if a slave girl or home-reared slave boy is available, on whom you can mount an attack straightaway, do you prefer to burst with the erection?\\") Similarly in Priapeia 33.5, the god Priapus says: : ::(\\"Shameful indeed to do, but so that I don't burst with desire, I shall put down my sickle and my hand will become my girlfriend.\\") An adjective to describe a penis which refused to become erect was . Ovid (Am≈çrƒìs 3.7.65-6): : ::(\\"But my members lay there as if prematurely dead, shamefully, more languid than yesterday's rose.\\") And a girlfriend of Horace's chides him with the words (Epodes 12): : ::(\\"You are less languid with Inachia than with me!\\") While Catullus (67.23) speaks of an impotent husband in these terms: : ::(\\"whose little dagger, hanging more flaccid than a tender beet (a vegetable) never raised itself to the middle of his tunic\\")  In the Romance languages  has evolved into Sicilian and Italian minchia and South Sardinian minca. Minga also exists in Spanish. Verpa is preserved in some Romance dialects, usually with another meaning; verpile is a sort of stirrup and spur in a Calabrian dialect, possibly named for its shape. Most Romance languages have adopted metaphorical euphemisms as the chief words for the penis; as in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian verga, obscene for penis, and in Romanian vargƒÉ (although pulƒÉ is far more common), in Catalan and French verge, from Latin , \\"staff\\", and French queue (\\"tail\\"), from Latin \\"tail\\". The Portuguese caralho \\"penis\\", first attested in the 10th century, is thought to derive from a vulgar Latin word *caraculum \\"a little stake\\".\\"A origem da palavra caralho\\". Ciberd√∫vidas da L√≠ngua Portuguesa, quoting Dicion√°rio da L√≠ngua Portuguesa 2008, da Porto Editora. The Italian cazzo has no obvious Latin ancestor. A number of different suggestions have been made for its origin, but none has yet gained general acceptance.See cazzo (Italian Wikipedia).  : the testicles  The basic word for the testicles in Latin was (singular: ). It appears to have had an alternative form * (singular: ), from which the Spanish and other Romance forms are derived. (One late Latin source has the spelling ).  Etymology  The etymology of is obscure. Tucker, without explanation, gives *qogh-sle«ê-os (*kwogh-sley-os?), and relates it to cohum, an obscure word for \\"yoke\\". Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary relates the word to (\\"a leather sack for liquids\\"). However, this etymology is not generally accepted today, and according to the the etymology is unknown. In texts, the word for testicles is always spelled with col- not cull-, and is plural.  Usage  Cicero in his letter discussing obscene Latin words (ad Fam. 9.22) says at one point (\\"Lanuvian are respectable, but \\"Cliternian\\" ones are indecent\\"). (Lanuvium and Cliternia were small towns not far from Rome.) However, the meaning of these phrases is not known, according to the . The word occurs in Petronius (44): : ::(\\"if we had any balls (i.e. if we were real men), he wouldn't be so pleased with himself!\\")See Adams (1982), p. 66. Martial (9.27) writes of a philosopher who had depilated his balls as well as the rest of his legs, using a pair of (tweezers): : ::(\\"since you carry your balls hairless, Chrestus\\"). A Pompeian graffito quotes a line of iambic verse:Adams (1982), p. 66. : ::(\\"When an old man lies down, his testicles cover his butthole.\\") The form of the line is reminiscent of the proverbial sayings of Publilius Syrus, many of which employ the same metre.  Synonyms and metaphors  The more decent word in Latin for testicles was (sing. ). This word may have derived from the Latin for \\"witnesses\\". Cicero's letter says (\\"In a court of law, witnesses is a quite decent word; not too much so elsewhere.\\") Katz (1998) draws attention to the fact that in some cultures it was customary to take a solemn oath while laying hands on the testicles either of a living person (as in Genesis 24:2-4; 47:29-31), or of a sacrificed animal (as described in Demosthenes 23.67f); a similar ritual took place in Umbria when dedicating a sacrificial animal. According to Katz, the word itself appears to be derived from the root trityo- (\\"third\\") and originally meant a third party. The two meanings of open the door for puns such as the following from Martial (2.72):Fontaine (2010), p. 237. : ::(\\"What about the fact that Caecilius has witnesses/testicles, Postumus?\\") Or Cicero's (\\"outstanding witnesses!\\") in his amusing account of two witnesses hiding naked in a public bathhouse.Cicero, , 63; cf. Adams, Elizabeth D. (2013). Esse videtur: Occurrences of Heroic Clausulae in Cicero‚Äôs Orations. (University of Kansas MA thesis), p. 42. The diminutive was entirely confined to the anatomical sense; it is used 33 times by the medical writer Celsus, but not at all.Adams (1982), p. 67. The satirists Persius and Juvenal also used the word . Veterinary writers use both and . In Catullus (63.5), the testicles are famously referred to as (\\"weights\\"), perhaps a metaphor of the weights hung on threads of a loom.Wray (2001). The exact words of the text here are disputed,See Currie(1996); Kokoszkiewicz (2011). but the general sense is clear: : ::(\\"He tore off the weights of his groin with a sharp flint\\") Ovid ( 2.241) recounting the same story, and perhaps implying that Attis removed the whole organ, similarly uses the phrase (\\"the burden of his groin\\").Wray (2001), p. 122. Other euphemisms are used in other writers. Ovid (Am≈çrƒìs 2.3) uses the phrase :Adams (1982), p. 69. : ::(\\"He who first cut off the genital parts of boys ought himself to have suffered the wounds which he made.\\")  In the Romance languages  is productive in most of the Romance languages: cf. Italian , French ; Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Sardinian , Romanian , Spanish (now a loanword in English).  Cunnus: the vulva  Cunnus was the basic Latin word for the vulva. The Priapeia mention it in connection with mentula, above. Despite its similarity to \\"cunt\\", the Oxford English Dictionary cautions that the two words may have developed from different roots.  Etymology  Cunnus has a distinguished Indo-European lineage. It is cognate with Persian kun \\"anus\\" and kos \\"vulva\\", and with Greek (kusthos). Tucker and de Vaan derive it from an Indo-European *kut-nos akin to Welsh cwd 'bag, scrotum'.  Usage  Cicero's Orator (ad Marcum Brutum) ¬ß154 confirms its obscene status. Cicero writes: : dƒ´citur \\"cum illƒ´s\\"; \\"cum autem n≈çbƒ´s\\" non dƒ´citur, sed \\"nobƒ´scum\\"; quia sƒ´ ita dƒ´cerƒìtur, obscaenius concurrerent litterae. :: (\\"We say cum illƒ´s (\\"with them\\"), but we don't say cum nobis ['with us'], but rather nobiscum; because if we said it like that, the letters would run together in a rather obscene way.\\") Because the /m/ of cum assimilates to the /n/ of n≈çbƒ´s, cum n≈çbƒ´s sounds very similar to cunn≈ç bis, meaning \\"in/from/with a cunt twice\\". A similar euphemism occurs in French: the avoidance of qu'on, homophone to con (cunt), by the insertion of a superfluous letter: que l'on. Horace, however, uses the word cunnus in his Satires (Sermones) at 1.2.70, and again at 1.3.105: : Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus taeterrima bellƒ´ causa. . . :: (\\"For even before Helen, the cunt was a most loathsome cause of war\\") Martial also uses it freely, for example (3.87): :nƒÅrrat tƒì r≈´mor, Chionƒì, numquam esse fut≈´tam atque nihil cunn≈ç p≈´rius esse tu≈ç. tƒìcta tamen non hƒÅc, quƒÅ dƒìbƒìs, parte lavƒÅris: sƒ´ pudor est, trƒÅnsfer subligar in faciem. ::(\\"Rumour has it, Chione, that you have never been fucked and that there is nothing purer than your cunt. However, you go to the baths without covering the part you should; if you have any modesty, transfer your loincloth to your face!\\") The word cunnilingus occurs in literary Latin, most frequently in Martial; it denotes the person who performs the action, not the action itself as in modern English, where it is not obscene but technical. The term comes from the Latin word for the vulva (cunnus) and the verb \\"to lick\\" (linguere, cf. lingua \\"tongue\\").  Synonyms and metaphors  These include sinus, \\"indentation\\", and fossa, \\"ditch\\". The modern scientific or polite words vulva and vagina both stem from Latin, but originally they had different meanings. The word vƒÅgƒ´na is the Latin word for scabbard or sword-sheath. Vulva (or volva) in classical Latin generally signified the womb, especially in medical writing, and also it is also common in the Vetus Latina (pre-Jerome) version of the Bible.Adams (1982), pp. 101-2. The meanings of vagina and vulva have changed by means of metaphor and metonymy, respectively. Other words for the womb are uterus, mƒÅtrƒ´x (in later Latin), venter (\\"belly\\"), and alvus (also \\"belly\\"). At Juvenal 6.129, however, the word volva is used of the vagina or clitoris of the (allegedly) nymphomaniac empress Messalina, who is described as departing from a session in a brothel:Adams (1982), p. 103. :adh≈´c ardƒìns rigidae tentƒ´gine volvae, et lassƒÅta virƒ´s necdum satiƒÅta recessit ::(\\"still burning with the excitement of her rigid 'volva', tired out by men but still not satisfied, she departs\\")  In the Romance languages  Cunnus is preserved in almost every Romance language: e.g. French con, Catalan cony, Spanish co√±o, Galician cona, Portuguese cona, (South) Sardinian cunnu, Old Italian cunna. In Calabrian dialects the forms cunnu (m.) and cunna (f.) are used as synonyms of \\"stupid, dumb\\"; the same is true of the French con, conne and in fact this has become the primary meaning of the words, both eclipsing the genital sense and significantly reducing the word's obscenity. In Portuguese it has been transferred to the feminine gender; the form cunna is also attested in Pompeian graffiti and in some late Latin texts.  Landƒ´ca: the clitoris  The ancient Romans had medical knowledge of the clitoris, and their native word for it was landƒ´ca. This appears to have been one of the most obscene words in the entire Latin lexicon. It is alluded to, but does not appear, in literary sources, except in the Priapeia 79, which calls it misella landica, the \\"poor little clitoris\\". It does, however, appear in graffiti.  Usage  Not even the poets Catullus and Martial, whose frankness is notorious, ever refer to landƒ´ca. In a letter to a friend,Cicero, Epistolae ad Familiares, 9.22 Cicero discusses which words in Latin are potentially obscene or subject to obscene punning, and there hints at the word landƒ´ca by quoting an unintentionally obscene utterance made in the Senate: : . . . hanc culpam maiorem an illam dƒ´cam? :: \\"shall I say that this or that was the greater fault?\\" with illam dƒ´cam echoing the forbidden word. Note that the \\"m\\" at the end of \\"illam\\" was pronounced like \\"n\\" before the following \\"d.\\" The word landƒ´ca is found in Roman graffiti: (\\"I seek Fulvia's clitoris\\") appears on a leaden projectile found at Perugia left over from the Perusine War,Raffaele Garrucci, Sylloge inscriptionum Latinarum aevi Romanae rei publicae..., Paravia 1875, p. 318. while a derivative word is found in Pompeii: (\\"Euplia (is) loose and has a large clitoris\\").Antonio Varone, Erotica Pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii, 2002, , p. 147. It also occurs in Priapeia 78.5 (in some versions 79.5), where a girl who has received the attentions of a cunnilingus is described as suffering from landƒ´cae ... fossƒ´s (\\"cracks in her clitoris\\").Adams (1982), p. 97. The word also occurs twice in a medical context in a 5th-6th century Latin translation of Soranus of Ephesus's book on gynaecology.Fay (1907), p. 13. Fay (1907) suggests one possible etymology as (g)landƒ´ca (\\"a little gland\\").  Synonyms and metaphors  Martial's epigram 1.90 alludes to a woman who uses her clitoris as a penis in a lesbian encounter, referring to it as her \\"prodigious Venus\\":Joseph S. Salemi \\"Three Sexual Poems by Marcus Valerius Martialis\\" : inter sƒì gemin≈çs audƒìs committere cunn≈çs mentƒ´turque virum pr≈çdigi≈çsa Venus. :: (\\"You dare to rub two cunts together and your prodigious Venus pretends to be a man.\\") In the Satires of Juvenal it is referred to euphemistically as a crista, \\"crest\\" in this line (6.420), describing a lady's massage after an exercise session: : callidus et cristae digit≈çs inpressit aliptƒìs ac summum dominae femur exclƒÅmƒÅre coƒìgit :: (\\"And the cunning masseur presses his fingers on her 'crest' and causes the top of his mistress's thigh to cry aloud\\")  In the Romance languages  Landƒ´ca survived in Old French landie (extremely rare),Adams (1982), p. 98. and in Romanian lindic.  C≈´lus: the anus  The basic Latin word for the anus was c≈´lus.Adams (1982), p. 110. Though not very common, it occurs in both Catullus and Martial, and is productive in Romance. The word is of uncertain etymology, according to Adams. Usage In the texts c≈´lus appears to be used only of humans. It was associated with both defecation and with sex. Catullus (23) mocks a certain Furius with these words: :quod c≈´lus tibi p≈´rior salill≈ç est nec t≈çt≈ç deciƒìs cacƒÅs in ann≈ç ::(\\"Because your arsehole is purer than a salt- cellar and you don't shit more than ten times in a whole year!\\") Martial (2.51) mocks a passive homosexual in these terms:Quoted in Williams (2010), p. 96. :≈™nus saepe tibƒ´ t≈çtƒÅ dƒìnƒÅrius arcƒÅ cum sit et hic c≈´l≈ç trƒ´tior, Hylle, tu≈ç, n≈çn tamen hunc pistor, n≈çn auferet hunc tibi c≈çp≈ç, sed sƒ´ quis nimi≈ç pƒìne superbus erit. ƒ´nfƒìlƒ´x venter spectat convƒ´via c≈´lƒ´, et semper miser hic ƒìsurit, ille vorat. ::(\\"Though you often have only one denarius in your whole money-chest, Hyllus, and that rubbed smoother than your arsehole, yet it's not the baker, nor the innkeeper, who will take that away from you, but anyone who is proud of his over-sized penis. Your unlucky stomach looks at the banquets of your arsehole, and the former is always hungry, poor thing, while the latter devours.\\")  P≈çdex  The word p≈çdex was synonymous with c≈´lus, \\"arsehole\\". This word is thought to be an o-stem version of the same root as pƒìdere \\"to fart\\", identifying it as the source of flatulence. Lewis and Short's Dictionary cites only two instances. In an unattractive picture of an old woman Horace (Epodes 8.6) writes: :hietque turpis inter ƒÅridƒÅs natƒ´s p≈çdex velut cr≈´dae bovis. ::(\\"And (when) there gapes between your wrinkled buttocks an ugly arsehole like that of a cow with diarrhoea.\\") Juvenal (2.12), writing of outwardly virile but in practice effeminate philosophers, writes: :hispida membra quidem et d≈´rae per bracchia saetae promittunt atr≈çcem animum, sed p≈çdice lƒìvƒ´ caeduntur tumidae medic≈ç ridente mariscae. ::(\\"Your hairy limbs and the tough bristles along your arms promise a stern spirit, it's true, but from your smooth arsehole swollen figs (i.e. piles) are cut out as the doctor laughs.\\") The implication is that the piles have been caused by anal sex; that such anal piles or sores are caused by sex is a common theme in the poems of Martial.Adams (1981b), p. 246. P≈çdex seems to have been rather a rarer word than c≈´lus. It is not used by Catullus, and only twice by Martial. It is not found in Pompeii, and did not produce derivatives in vulgar Latin or in the Romance languages. The fact that it is used once by Juvenal (who avoided obscene vocabulary) shows that it was less offensive than c≈´lus. In later medical Latin, such as the 5th century Cassius Felix, it could be used as an alternative for ƒÅnus.Adams (1981b), p. 235. Other synonyms A more seemly Latin word for the backside was cl≈´nƒìs (singular cl≈´nis) \\"buttocks\\"; this word was generally more decent than c≈´lus, and older, as well: it has several Indo-European cognates. It can be used for the rump of animals as well as humans, and even birds.Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. The word is usually plural but sometimes singular. In the same satire quoted above Juvenal (2.20‚Äì21) speaks scathingly of philosophers who have double standards, preaching about virtue but practising vice: :dƒì virt≈´te loc≈´tƒ´ cl≈´nem agitant. 'ego tƒì cƒìventem, Sexte, verƒìbor?' ::(\\"They speak of virtue but waggle their rump. 'Am I going to respect you, Sextus, when you behave in such a camp way?'\\") Another word for buttocks, slightly less common, was natƒìs, which is generally used only of the buttocks of humans. It seems to have been a more vulgar or colloquial word than cl≈´nƒìs.Adams (1981b), p. 240. In one of the Priapeia epigrams (22, in some editions 21) the god Priapus threatens potential thieves with punishment as follows:Richlin (1981), p. 42. :fƒìmina sƒ´ f≈´rtum mihi faciet virve puerve haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille natƒìs. ::(\\"If any woman steals (from my garden) or a man or a boy, the first must provide her cunt, the second his head, the third his buttocks.\\") ƒÄnus was the name for the posterior opening of the digestive tract; the word is not specific to that usage, but instead originally meant \\"ring\\". Its anatomical sense drove out its other meanings, and for this reason the diminutive ƒÅnulus became the usual Latin name for a ring or circle. In his book on agriculture, Columella describes how to treat a cow with stomach-ache: :sƒ´ dolor remanet, ungulƒÅs circumsecƒÅre, et unctƒÅ man≈´ per ƒÅnum ƒ´nsertƒÅ fimum extrahere ::(\\"If any pain remains, trim your nails, insert your oiled hand through its anus and extract the dung\\") An example of the usage of \\"ring\\" as a metaphor in a modern Romance language can be found in Brazilian Portuguese slang, in which the word anel can have the same double meaning, especially in the expression o anel de couro (the leather ring). \\"Ring\\" is also British slang for \\"anus\\".  In the Romance languages  C≈´lus has been preserved as meaning the buttocks (rather than the anus) in most Romance languages except for Portuguese, which kept the original semantics. It yields the forms culo in Spanish and Italian; in French and Catalan it becomes cul, in Romanian cur, in Vegliot Dalmatian ƒçol, in Sardinian culu, in Portuguese cu and in Galician cu. Its offensiveness varies from one language to another; in French it was incorporated into ordinary words and expressions such as culottes, \\"breeches\\", and cul-de-sac.  : to fuck  Decorative scene in the baths. Some scholars suggest that this is what was meant by a (\\"team of three\\").Uden (2007), p. 12. , infinitive , perfect , supine , Latin for \\"to fuck\\", is richly attested and useful. The etymology of is \\"obscure\\". It may be related to \\"repel, rebut\\" and , \\"suppress\\" or \\"beat down\\", and come from a root meaning \\"beat\\".Adams (1982), p. 118. Futu≈ç is richly attested in all its forms in Latin literature. In one poem (10.81.1) Martial writes, using the supine: : ::(\\"When two men came one morning to Phyllis for a fuck...\\") Not only the word itself, but also derived words such as , \\"fucked out, exhausted from sex\\" (Catullus 41), (Catullus 29, same meaning), and \\"to have sex with\\" (Catullus 37) are attested in Classical Latin literature. The derived noun , \\"act of intercourse\\", also exists in Classical Latin, and the , which corresponds to the English epithet \\"fucker\\", but lacking the derogatory tone of the English word. The god Priapus says in one poem (Priapeia 63): : ::(\\"To this (p....) of mine, a girl ‚Äì I almost added the name ‚Äì is accustomed to come with her boyfriend\\") It is also used metaphorically in Catullus 6, which speaks of , funds exhausted, literally \\"fucked away\\". , unlike the English word \\"fuck\\", was more frequently used in erotic and celebratory senses rather than derogatory ones or insults. A woman of Pompeii wrote the graffito (\\"I got laid here\\")Varone (2002), p. 83. and prostitutes, canny at marketing, appear to have written other graffiti complimenting their customers for their sexual prowess: : ::(\\"Lucky boy, you fuck well\\"); : ::(\\"Victorious, best wishes to one who fucks well\\"). It is famously used in Catullus 32: : :: (\\"but you remain at home and prepare for us nine acts of fucking, one after the other.\\") in its active voice was used of women only when it was imagined that they were taking the active role thought appropriate to the male partner by the Romans. The woman in Martial 7.70 is described as a , a lesbian. : :: (\\"Lesbian of all lesbians, Philaenis, you are right to call the woman you fuck, your 'girlfriend'.\\") Other more neutral synonyms for in Latin include , literally \\"to enter\\", as in this sentence from Suetonius, supposedly from a letter written by Mark Antony (lover of Queen Cleopatra) to his brother-in-law Octavian (later to become the Emperor Augustus):cf. Suetonius, Life of Augustus 69. : :: (\\"What has changed you? Is it because I'm sleeping with the queen? ... So is Drusilla the only woman you sleep with?\\") The word , literally \\"to go with,\\" whence Latin and English coitus, is also used euphemistically for sexual intercourse, but it is not exactly a synonym for . It can be used for both men and women, and also of animals and birds.Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. Another word found on Pompeian inscriptions was , which appears to be a borrowing from the Greek () \\"loosen\\".Adams (1982), pp. 172-3. A Pompeian inscription says (\\"Dionysius is allowed to fuck whenever he wants to\\").Varone (2002), p. 66. The Latin word appears to be used in the same sense in Priapeia 31: (\\"these weapons of my belly will relax you\\" (of ).Adams (1982), p. 173. Adams (1982) lists a large number of other euphemisms for the sexual act,Adams (1982), pp. 171-207. such as this one from Juvenal (6.126): : ::(\\"And lying on her back she absorbed the blows of all and sundry\\")  In the Romance languages  , a core item of the lexicon, lives on in most of the Romance languages, sometimes with its sense somewhat weakened: Catalan fotre, French foutre, Spanish joder, Portuguese foder, Galician foder, Romanian fute (futere), Italian fottere. A famous ribald song in Old Occitan sometimes attributed to the troubadour William IX of Aquitaine reads: : Tant las fotei com auziretz: Cen e quatre vint et ueit vetz, Q'a pauc no-i rompei mos corretz E mos arnes :: (\\"I fucked them as much as you will hear: a hundred and eighty-eight times. I most nearly broke my equipment \\\\-- and my tool.\\")  Pƒìdƒ´cƒÅre: to sodomise  The aggressive sense of English \\"fuck\\" and \\"screw\\" was not strongly attached to futu≈ç in Latin. Instead, these aggressive connotations attached themselves to pƒìdƒ´cƒÅre \\"to sodomise\\" and irrumƒÅre \\"to force fellatio\\" respectively, which were used with mock hostility in Catullus 16: : Pƒìdƒ´cƒÅb≈ç ego v≈çs et irrumƒÅb≈ç, Aurƒìlƒ´ pathice et cinaede F≈´rƒ´, quƒ´ mƒì ex versiculƒ´s meƒ´s putƒÅstis, quod sunt molliculƒ´, parum pudƒ´cum. :: (\\"I will bugger and facefuck you, pervert Aurelius and faggot Furius, since you thought me indecent because my poems are somewhat sissified.\\") The passive voice, pƒìdƒ´cƒÅrƒ´, is used of the person who is forced to submit to anal sex, as in Priapeia 35, in which the god Priapus threatens a thief: :pƒìdƒ´cƒÅbere, f≈´r, semel; sed ƒ´dem sƒ´ dƒìprƒìnsus eris bis, irrumƒÅb≈ç. ::(\\"You will be buggered, thief, on the first offence; but if you are caught a second time, I will stick it in your mouth.\\") There is some doubt in the dictionaries whether the correct spelling was ped- or paed- (Lewis and Short give the latter). B√ºcheler (1915, p. 105) argues that ped- is correct on the basis of the following epigram in the Priapeia (no. 67): :Pƒínelopƒìs prƒ´mam Dƒ™d≈çnis prƒ´ma sequƒÅtur et prƒ´mam CAdmi syllaba prƒ´ma REmƒ´, quodque fit ex illƒ´s, mihi t≈´ dƒìprƒìnsus in hort≈ç, f≈´r, dabis: hƒÅc poenƒÅ culpa luenda tua est. ::(\\"Let the first syllable of 'Penelope' be followed by the first of 'Dido', and the first of 'Cadmus' by the first of 'Remus', and what comes out of them is what you will pay to me if you are caught in the garden, thief; it is with this penalty you must pay for your crime.\\") Pƒìdƒ´cƒÅtor and pƒìdƒ´co (noun) The word pƒìdƒ´cƒÅtor (\\"buggerer\\") is used in a poem by Catullus's friend the orator Licinius Calvus quoted by Suetonius (Caesar 49), in which the King of Bithynia is referred to as pƒìdƒ´cƒÅtor Caesaris (\\"the buggerer of Caesar\\"), referring to a rumour that in his youth Julius Caesar had had an affair with king Nicomedes. Martial on the other hand preferred to use the shorter form pƒìdƒ´c≈ç or pƒìdƒ´co, of the same meaning,Adams (1982), p. 123. for example at 11.87: :dƒ´ves erƒÅs quondam: sed tunc pƒìdƒ´co fuistƒ´ et tibi n≈´lla di≈´ fƒìmina n≈çta fuit. nunc sectƒÅris an≈´s. ≈ç quantum c≈çgit egestƒÅs! illa fut≈´t≈çrem tƒì, Charidƒìme, facit. :: (\\"Once you were rich; but in those days you were a pƒìdƒ´co, and for a long time no woman was known to you. Now you chase after old women. O the things that poverty forces one to do! That woman is making a fucker out of you, Charidemus!\\") The activities of a pƒìdƒ´co are hinted at in the following lines of Martial (12.85): :pƒìdƒ´c≈çnibus ≈çs olƒìre dƒ´cis. hoc sƒ´, sƒ´cut ais, Fabulle, vƒìrum est: quid tu crƒìdis olƒìre cunnilingƒ´s? :: (\\"You say that buggerers' mouths stink. If this is true as you say, Fabullus, what do you think the mouth of pussy-lickers smells of?\\") The various distinctions in sexual activity are made clear in the following poem of Martial (2.28): :rƒ´dƒìt≈ç multum quƒ´ tƒì, Sextille, cinaedum dƒ´xerit et digitum porrigit≈ç medium. sed nec pƒìdƒ´co es nec t≈´, Sextille, fut≈´tor, calda Vetustƒ´nae nec tibi bucca placet. ex istƒ´s nihil es fateor, Sextille: quid erg≈ç es? nescio, sed t≈´ scƒ´s rƒìs superesse duƒÅs. :: (\\"Laugh a lot, Sextillus, if anyone calls you effeminate (cinaedus), and show him your middle finger; but you're also neither a buggerer (pƒìdƒ´co) nor a fucker (fut≈´tor), nor does the hot mouth of Vetustina please you. You're none of those, I admit, Sextillus, so what are you? I don't know, but you know there are only two other possibilities!\\") The fourth line rules out Sextillus as an irrumƒÅtor; the two remaining possibilities were in Roman eyes the most degrading, that he was either a cunnilingus or a fellƒÅtor.Sapsford (2012), p. 80. Etymology Pƒìdƒ´cƒÅre is often thought to be a Greek loanword in Latin (from the noun (paidika) \\"boyfriend\\"), but the long \\"i\\" is an obstacle. B√ºcheler (1915, p. 105), who rejects this etymology, suggests there may be a connection to p≈çdex and pƒìd≈ç. In Romance Unlike futu≈ç, the word pƒìdƒ´c≈ç has no reflexes in Romance.Adams (1982), p. 133. The French slang word p√©d√© (\\"male homosexual\\") is an abbreviated form of p√©d√©raste, according to the Dictionnaire historique de la langue fran√ßaise. IrrumƒÅre and fellƒÅre: oral sex IrrumƒÅre: to make suck IrrumƒÅre, which in English is denoted by the passive construction \\"to be sucked\\", is an active verb in Latin, since the irrumƒÅtor was considered to be the active partner, the fellƒÅtor the passive. IrrumƒÅtio is the counterpart of fellƒÅtio; in Roman terms, which are the opposite way round to modern conceptions, the giver of oral sex inserts his penis into the mouth of the receiver. To be forced to submit to oral sex was apparently a worse punishment than to be sodomised. Martial (2.47) advises one effeminate man who is having an adulterous affair, and who would not perhaps have objected too much if the husband punished him by sodomising him: :c≈çnfƒ´dƒ´s natibus? non est pƒìdƒ´co marƒ´tus; quae faciat duo sunt: irrumat aut futuit. ::(\\"Do you rely on your buttocks (to avoid a worse punishment)? Your girlfriend's husband is not a sodomiser. He does two things only: puts it in your mouth or screws women.\\") According to Adams (1982, p. 126-7), it was a standard joke to speak of irrumƒÅtio as a means of silencing someone. Martial (3.96) writes: :garris quasi moechus et fut≈´tor; sƒ´ tƒì prendero, Gargilƒ´, tacƒìbis. ::(\\"You gossip like an adulterer and a womaniser; but if I catch you, Gargilius, you will be quiet!\\") IrrumƒÅtio was seen as a hostile act that enemies might inflict on one. An inscription says:Adams (1982), p. 127. :mƒÅlim mƒì amƒ´cƒ´ fellent quam inimƒ´cƒ´ irrument ::(\\"I would prefer my friends to suck me than that my enemies make me suck them.\\") It is also a standard threat made by the god Priapus, protector of orchards, to potential adult male thieves, as in Priapeia 13: :percƒ´dƒìre, puer, mone≈ç: futuƒìre, puella: barbƒÅtum f≈´rem tertia poena manet ::(\\"You will be thoroughly 'cut', boy, I warn you; girl, you will be fucked; for the bearded thief, a third penalty awaits.\\") FellƒÅre: to suck The word fellƒÅre originally had an innocent sense, meaning to suck the teat or to suck milk, but in classical times the sexual sense was predominant. The verb fell≈ç and the nouns fellƒÅtor and (less often) the feminine fellƒÅtrƒ´x are common in graffiti, and the first two also occur several times in Martial's epigrams.Adams (1982), p. 131. The practice was thought particularly degrading for a man, and Martial, mocking a certain butch lesbian, writes (7.67): :n≈çn fellat ‚Äì putat hoc parum virƒ´le ‚Äì sed plƒÅnƒì mediƒÅs vorat puellƒÅs ::(\\"She does not suck cocks ‚Äì she thinks this not masculine enough ‚Äì but absolutely devours the middle parts of girls.\\") Fell≈ç was generally used absolutely, without an object.Adams (1982), p. 135. A Pompeian wall inscription says Murtis bene felas (\\"Myrtis, you suck well\\"),Varone (2002), p. 77. and another says Romula cum suo hic fellat et uubique (\\"Romula does fellatio with her boyfriend here and everywhere\\").Varone (2002), p. 70. Fell≈ç leaves little trace in Romance languages, being replaced by s≈´gere (\\"to suck\\") and its derivatives. Though it is not represented by descendants, it is represented by learned borrowings such as the French fellation. Lingere and lambere: to lick The verb ling≈ç (\\"I lick\\") was common in both sexual and non-sexual contexts. As a sexual term, it could have c≈´lum, mentulam, or cunnum as its object.Adams (1982), p. 134. Its synonym lambere was also sometimes used in a sexual sense. Martial (3.81) criticises a eunuch who presumed to have oral sex with women: :haec dƒìbet medi≈çs lambere lingua vir≈çs ::(\\"That tongue of yours ought to be licking the middle parts of men (not women)\\") Gl≈´bere: to \\"peel\\" Gl≈´bere \\"to take the bark off\\", \\"peel\\" and dƒìgl≈´bere \\"to take the husk off\\", \\"to skin, flay\\" are famously used in a sexual sense in two places in Latin literature by Catullus and Ausonius.Penella (1976). It has been argued that the meaning is to pull back a man's foreskin, in order to masturbate him. Ausonius (Ep. 71), after mentioning various perversions (obscƒìnƒÅs venerƒìs), says: : Crispa tamen c≈´nctƒÅs exercet corpore in ≈´n≈ç dƒìgl≈´bit, fellat, m≈çlƒ´tur per utramque cavernam, nƒì quid inexpertum fr≈´strƒÅ morit≈´ra relinquat ::(\\"Crispa, however, practices all the perversions in one body: she 'peels', she sucks, she puts it in either hole, lest she leave anything untried before she dies.\\") What seems to shock Ausonius is that Crispa actively enjoyed taking an active role in such practices rather than passively submitting to male desires as was the norm. The other sexual use of this word is in Catullus (57), who says in a moment of bitterness: :Caelƒ´, Lesbia nostra, Lesbia illa, illa Lesbia, quam Catullus ≈´nam pl≈´s quam sƒì atque su≈çs amƒÅvit omnƒìs, nunc in quadriviƒ´s et angiportƒ´s gl≈´bit magnanimƒ´ Remƒ´ nep≈çtƒìs. ::(\\"Caelius, our Lesbia, that Lesbia, that one woman whom Catullus loved more than himself and all his dear ones now on crossroads and in alleys 'peels' the grandsons of magnanimous Remus.\\") Some, noting that in Italian the phrases cavar la pelle, scorticare (\\"debark\\") can mean \\"strip someone of their money\\", and similar uses of tondƒìre (\\"to shear\\") and dƒìgl≈´bere (\\"to skin\\") in Latin, have argued that Catullus is also using the word in a non-sexual sense; that is, Lesbia is acting like a prostitute and fleecing the spendthrift Roman young men (nep≈çtƒìs) of their money.Penella (1976), note 4.Muse (2009), pp. 310-11.  Cƒìvƒìre and crƒ´sƒÅre: to waggle Cƒìve≈ç (cƒìvƒìre, cƒìvƒ´) and crƒ´s≈ç (crƒ´sƒÅre etc.) are basic Latin obscenities that have no exact English equivalents. Crƒ´s≈ç referred to the actions of the female partner in sexual intercourse (i.e. grinding or riding on a penis); as, similarly to the case in English, futu≈ç, which is often translated \\"fuck\\", primarily referred to the male action (i.e. thrusting, pounding, slamming). Cƒìve≈ç referred to the similar activity of the passive partner in anal sex.  Etymology  Both of these verbs are of fairly obscure origin. Unlike some of the vocabulary of homosexuality in Latin (pathicus, cinaedus), cƒìve≈ç seems not to be of Greek origin. Francis A. Wood relates it to an Indo-European root *kweu- or *qeu-, relating to a variety of back and forth motions.  Usage  Cƒìve≈ç always refers to a male taking the bottom role in anal sex. Martial 3.95 contains the phrase: : sed pƒìdƒ´cƒÅris, sed pulchrƒì, Naevole, cƒìvƒìs. ::(\\"But you get buggered and you wiggle your arse so prettily, Naevolus.\\") Crƒ´s≈ç appears to have had a similar meaning, but to have been used of the female. Again Martial 10.68: : Numquid, cum crƒ´sƒÅs, blandior esse potes? T≈´ licet ƒìdiscƒÅs t≈çtam referƒÅsque Corinthon, N≈çn tamen omnƒ´n≈ç, Laelia, LƒÅis eris. :: (\\"Could you possibly be prettier as you grind? You learn easily, and could do everything they do in Corinth; but you'll never be Lais, Laelia.\\") Lais was a famous prostitute or courtesan, and Corinth was the site of a major temple of Aphrodite; the temple employed more than a thousand cult prostitutes.  Synonyms and metaphors  These words have few synonyms or metaphors, and belong almost to a sort of technical vocabulary.  In the Romance languages  Both words seem to have been lost in Romance. MasturbƒÅrƒ´: to masturbate This word is found twice in the poet Martial, but apparently not in earlier writers.Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. Martial writes in one poem (11.104): :masturbƒÅbantur Phrygiƒ´ post ≈çstia servƒ´, Hectore≈ç quotiƒìns sƒìderat uxor equ≈ç ::(\\"The Phrygian slaves used to masturbate behind the doors whenever Hector's wife sat on her husband's 'horse'.\\") The word masturbƒÅtor also occurs. In 14.203 Martial writes of a Spanish girl from GƒÅdƒìs (C√°diz): :tam tremulum crƒ´sat, tam blandum pr≈´rit, ut ipsum masturbƒÅt≈çrem fƒìcerit Hippolytum. ::(\\"She wiggles so sexily and itches for it so charmingly that she would have made a masturbator out of Hippolytus himself!\\") Hippolytus was famous in mythology for refusing the advances of his stepmother Phaedra. Etymology Lewis and Short suggest that the word masturbƒÅrƒ´ may be derived from man≈´ stuprƒÅrƒ´ \\"to defile oneself with a hand\\", and this is the usual view, and supported (\\"with some hesitation\\") by J.N. Adams.Adams (1982), pp. 208‚Äì211. Another view,Hallett (1976).D. Q. Adams (1985). however, is that it comes from *mƒÅs + turbƒÅre (\\"to excite the penis\\"), assuming an otherwise unattested meaning of \\"penis\\" for mƒÅs (\\"male\\"). The supporters of this view cite another word mascarpi≈çnem (from mascarpi≈ç), which occurs once in Latin literature in Petronius (134.5), and which appears from the context to mean \\"beating the penis with a wand (to stimulate it)\\". It is argued that in this word, the element mƒÅs- may be the same as in masturbƒÅrƒ´. Yet another proposed etymology is that the element masturb- derives from a Proto-Indo-European root *mostrgh- meaning \\"brain, marrow\\", and hence \\"semen\\".Katz (1998), pp. 210-11. Synonyms and euphemisms Martial (9.41) criticises a Roman gentleman for masturbating, using the phrase: :paelice laevƒÅ ≈´teris et Venerƒ´ servit amƒ´ca manus ::(\\"you use your left hand as a concubine and your hand serves Venus as your girlfriend\\") The hand used for masturbating by the Romans was evidently the left one, as Martial 11.73 confirms.Varone (2002), p. 95. (Compare also the fragment of the satirist Lucilius quoted above in the section on m≈´t≈ç.) In another poem (11.22) Martial advises a friend: :inguina saltem parce fut≈´trƒ´cƒ´ sollicitƒÅre man≈´ ::(\\"do at least cease from troubling your groins with copulating hand\\"). He continues: :lƒìvibus in puerƒ´s pl≈´s haec quam mentula peccat et faciunt digitƒ´ praecipitantque virum ::(\\"In smooth-skinned boys this (i.e their hand) sins more than their cock, and their fingers hasten the process of turning them into a man.\\") This apparently dates back to a belief of Aristotle that vigorous sexual activity caused a boy's voice to turn rapidly into that of a man.Quoted in Schultheiss et al. (2003). In another poem (2.43), however, Martial admits that he himself for want of a sexual partner sometimes resorts to the practice: :at mihi succurrit pr≈ç Ganymƒìde manus ::(\\"but as for me, my hand has to serve instead of Ganymede\\"). In another (11.46), addressed to a man who finds it difficult in middle age to get an erection, Martial uses the word tr≈´d≈ç (\\"I shove\\" or \\"prod\\") to signify masturbation:Beckelhymer (2014), p. 240. :tr≈´ditur et digitƒ´s pann≈´cea mentula lassƒ´s nec levat extƒ´nctum sollicitƒÅta caput ::(\\"and your shrivelled dick is prodded by your fingers until they get tired, but doesn't raise its worn out head even when provoked\\"). The frequentative form of tr≈´d≈ç is tr≈´sƒÅre (\\"to thrust or shove repeatedly\\"). This occurs in only one place, in Catullus 56: : dƒìprendƒ´ modo p≈´pulum puellae tr≈´santem: hunc ego, sƒ´ placet Di≈çnae, pr≈ç tƒìl≈ç rigidƒÅ meƒÅ cecƒ´dƒ´. :: (\\"Recently I caught the ward of my girfriend 'thrusting'; this boy, if it please Dione, using my 'hard one' as a weapon, I 'cut'.\\") The meaning of tr≈´santem here is disputed. \\"Masturbating\\" was the interpretation of A. E. Housman;Housman (1931), p. 402.Adams (1982), p. 146. he also wanted to read pr≈ç tƒìl≈ç as pr≈çtƒìl≈ç with the meaning \\"there and then\\". Others,Scott (1969), p. 24.Uden (2007), pp. 11-12.Beckelhymer (2014), pp. 240‚Äì241. however, understand Catullus to mean that the boy was caught having sex with a girl; in which case, pr≈çtƒìl≈ç probably means \\"in a threesome\\", since a pr≈çtƒìlum, according to the agricultural writer Cato the Elder, was a team of three oxen pulling a plough.Cf. Housman (1931), p. 402, though he rejects this interpretation. Uden (2007) translates: \\"I just caught a kid banging his girlfriend\\", explaining that p≈´pulum is a derogatory diminutive. The verb caedere (literally \\"to cut\\" or \\"kill\\") is used as slang for homosexual penetration elsewhere in Latin literature, such as at Priapeia 26.10, a poem in which Priapus boasts that in his earlier days solƒìbam f≈´rƒìs caedere quamlibet valentƒìs (\\"I used to 'cut' (i.e. sodomise) thieves, however strong they were\\").Adams (1982), pp. 145-6. Dione, was the mother of Aphrodite, goddess of love; according to a passage in Homer's Iliad book 5, she cared for Aphrodite when the latter was pierced by Diomedes' weapon in a battle. The implication is that her services might be needed here after Catullus had dealt with the boy.  CacƒÅre: to defecate  Cac≈ç, cacƒÅre was the chief Latin word for defecation.  Etymology  The word has a distinguished Indo-European parentage, which may perhaps relate to nursery words or children's slang that tends to recur across many different cultures. It would appear to be cognate with the Greek noun , kopros, meaning \\"excrement\\" (hence, coprophilia). It also exists in Germanic; in German, Swedish (kack), Scots (as both noun and verb, cack or cackie, the diminutive), whilst English \\"poppiecock\\" derives from Dutch pappe kak, \\"diarrhea\\". It exists in Turkish (kaka), Irish and Scottish Gaelic (cac), Hebrew, Hungarian (kaka), Ukrainian (–∫–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∏), Russian, Lithuanian and Persian/Isfahani accent (keke). In British English, \\"caca\\" is occasionally used as childish slang for excrement (similar to American English \\"poop\\"), a word whose level of obscene loading varies from country to country; whilst in Scotland and in Ireland, \\"cack\\" is occasionally used either as a mild interjection, or as an impolite adjective to mean of poor quality, broken, nonsense. It also exists as a loan in Finnish (kakka). The derivatives of this Latin word appear in Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Italian (cacca), Romanian, and French. Also, in Slavic languages: kakati.  Usage  The verb is usually used intransitively. Martial (1.92.11) says: :non c≈´lum, neque enim est c≈´lus, quƒ´ non cacat ≈çlim ::(\\"not your arsehole, for something that never shits isn't an arsehole\\") However, in the phrase below, from Catullus 36, it is transitive: : AnnƒÅles Volusƒ´, cacƒÅta carta, :: (\\"Annals of Volusius, paper defiled by shit\\")For a discussion of the meaning of cacƒÅta carta, see Watson, Lindsay C. (2005). \\"Catullan Recycling? Cacata carta\\". Mnemosyne, Fourth Series, Vol. 58, Fasc. 2 (2005), pp. 270-277.  Synonyms and metaphors  Few synonyms are attested in Classical Latin, apart from a word cunƒ´re, attested by the grammarian Festus (but nowhere else) in the meaning stercus facere. The word dƒìfƒìcƒÅre comes much later. A euphemism which occurs in Petronius (116) is suƒÅ rƒì causƒÅ facere: :habuimus ... et pƒÅnem autop»≥rum de su≈ç sibƒ´, quem ego mƒÅl≈ç quam candidum; et vƒ´rƒìs facit, et cum meƒÅ rƒì causƒÅ faci≈ç, n≈çn pl≈çr≈ç :(\\"We also had whole-wheat bread, which I prefer to white, since it gives you strength and also when I relieve myself, I don't feel pain.\\") The same euphemism is used in Petronius of relieving oneself of gas (see below).  In the Romance languages  CacƒÅre is preserved unaltered in Sardinian and the southern Italian dialects, and with little alteration in Italian (cagare). It becomes Galician, Catalan, Spanish, and Portuguese cagar, in Vegliot Dalmatian kakuor, in French chier, and in Romanian as cƒÉcare (the act of taking a dump) or a (se) cƒÉca. (Feces are referred to as caca in French, Catalan, Romanian (besides cƒÉcat) and Spanish childhood slang, while Portuguese and Romanian use the very same word with the general meaning of anything that looks or smells malodorous or reminiscent of excrement.) German kacken, Dutch kakken, Czech kakat, Lithuanian kakoti, Russian –∫–∞–∫–∞—Ç—å (kakat), Icelandic k√∫ka, Bosnian kakiti etc. are all slang words meaning \\"to defecate\\", most of them having roughly the same level of severity as the English expression \\"take a dump\\".  Merda: feces  Merda is the basic Latin word for excrement. Frequently used, it appears in most of the Romance languages.  Etymology  Merda represents Indo-European *s-merd-, whose root sense was likely \\"something malodorous.\\" It is cognate with German Mist (dung), Lithuanian \\"smirdƒóÃÅti\\" (\\"to stink\\"), Russian \\"—Å–º–µ—Ä–¥–µÃÅ—Ç—å\\" (smerd√©t, \\"to stink\\") and Polish ≈õmierdzieƒá (\\"to stink\\").  Usage  The word merda is attested in classical texts mostly in veterinary and agricultural contexts, meaning \\"manure\\". Cato the Elder uses it, as well as stercus, while the Mulomedicina Chironis speaks of merda b≈´bula, \\"cattle manure\\". Unlike the English word \\"shit\\", merda could be both singular and plural. In Horace (Satires 1.8.37), a talking statue of Priapus says: :mentior at sƒ´quid, merdƒ´s caput inquiner albƒ´s corv≈çrum atque in me veniat mictum atque cacƒÅtum I≈´lius, et fragilis PediƒÅtia, f≈´rque VorƒÅnus. ::(\\"But if I'm telling a lie, may my head be spattered with the white droppings of ravens, and may Julius, delicate Pediatia, and the thief Voranus come to piss and shit on me!\\") In one of his verse fables (4.18.25), Phaedrus speaks of some dogs who, on hearing thunder, :repente od≈çrem mixtum cum merdƒ´s cacant ::(\\"suddenly they shit out a stink mixed with turds\\") The word can also be used in a metaphorical sense, as at Martial 3.17, speaking of a tart which had been blown on by a man with impure breath (caused no doubt by oral sex) to cool it down:cf. Sapsford (2012), pp. 87‚Äì8. : Sed nƒìm≈ç potuit tangere: merda fuit. :: (\\"But nobody could touch it: it was a piece of shit.\\")  Synonyms and metaphors  The politer terms for merda in Classical Latin were stercus (gen. stercoris), \\"manure\\" and fimum or fimus, \\"filth.\\" Stercus was used frequently in the Vulgate, as in its well-known translation of Psalm 112:7: (Psalm 113:7 in the KJV.) : SuscitƒÅns ƒÅ terrƒÅ inopem, et dƒì stercore ƒìrigƒìns pauperem. :: (\\"Raising up the needy from the earth : and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill.\\" DRC) In Classical Latin, faex, plural faecƒìs, meant the dregs, such as are found in a bottle of wine; the word did not acquire the sense of feces until later.  In the Romance languages  Merda is productive in the Romance languages, and is the obvious etymon of French merde, Spanish mierda, and in Vegliot Dalmatian miarda. It is preserved unaltered in Catalan, Galician, Italian, Portuguese, and Sardinian. It was preserved in Romanian too, not for feces, where cƒÉcat (derived from caco) is used instead, but in the word dezmierda, originally meaning \\"to clean the bottom of (an infant)\\"; subsequently becoming \\"to cuddle\\" or \\"to fondle\\".  Pƒìdere and vissƒ´re: passing wind  Pƒìdere Pƒìd≈ç, pƒìdere, pepƒìdƒ´, pƒìditum is the basic Latin word for passing intestinal wind. In the Sermones 1.8, 46, Horace writes: : Nam, displ≈çsa sonat quantum vƒìsƒ´ca, pepƒìdƒ´ diffissƒÅ nate fƒ´cus. . . Christopher Smart translates this passage as \\"from my cleft bum of fig-tree I let out a fart, which made as great an explosion as a burst bladder\\". The \\"I\\" of this satire is the god Priapus, and Smart explains that he was made of fig-tree wood which split through being poorly prepared. Martial also uses the word several times, including the following (10.15): : nƒ´l aliud vide≈ç, qu≈ç tƒì crƒìdƒÅmus amƒ´cum, quam quod mƒì c≈çram pƒìdere, Crispe, solƒìs. :: (\\"I don't see any other reason why I should believe you a friend, other than that you are in the habit of farting in front of me, Crispus.\\") A word oppƒìdere (\\"to fart in the face of, mock\\") is used in Horace (Sat. 1.9.70). Catullus also uses the noun pƒìditum in one of his poems (54).  Vissƒ´re  A rarer word, meaning \\"to fart silently\\", was vissƒ´re. This is hinted at in Cicero's letter ad Fam. 9.22, where he says that the word divƒ´si≈ç is potentially obscene, in the same way as the word intercapƒìd≈ç.Cf. D.R. Shackleton Bailey, Cicero: Epistulae ad Familiares, vol. 2, p. 333. The word is not recorded in Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary and does not appear to have been used by any extant author. However, the Oxford Latin Dictionary quotes an inscription from a public bath in Ostia which saysFor further information on this inscription, which is in the form of an iambic senarius, see \\"The Room of the Seven Sages\\". :vissƒ´re tacitƒì Chƒ´l≈çn docuit subdolus ::(\\"cunning Chilon taught how to fart silently\\"). Judging from derivatives in some of the daughter languages (see below), there was also a noun *vissƒ´na \\"a silent fart\\", but no trace of this is found in the extant texts. CrepƒÅre The noise made by escaping flatulence was usually called crepitus, a word which could refer to \\"a noise\\" of various kinds, and the verb crepƒÅre was used of breaking wind noisily.Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. Martial writes of a certain man, who after an embarrassing incident of flatulence when praying in the temple of Jupiter, was careful in the future to take precautions: :cum vult in Capit≈çlium venƒ´re, sellƒÅs ante petit PatercliƒÅnƒÅs et pƒìdit deciƒìsque vƒ´ciƒìsque. sed quamvƒ´s sibi cƒÅverit crepand≈ç, compressƒ´s natibus Iovem sal≈´tat. ::(\\"Whenever he wants to come to the Capitolium (to pray) he first heads for the toilets of Paterclus and farts ten or twenty times. But however much he takes precautions by breaking wind, he still salutes Jupiter with clenched buttocks.\\") Euphemisms In Petronius (47), in the speech of the vulgar millionaire Trimalchio, euphemisms suƒÅ rƒì causƒÅ facere and facere quod sƒì iuvet \\"do what helps one\\" are both used for relieving oneself of wind: :itaque sƒ´ quis vestrum voluerit suƒÅ rƒì causƒÅ facere, n≈çn est quod illum pudeƒÅtur. ... ego n≈´llum put≈ç tam magnum tormentum esse quam continƒìre ... nec tamen in triclƒ´ni≈ç ullum vetu≈ç facere quod sƒì iuvet, et medicƒ´ vetant continƒìre. ::(\\"And so if any of you wants to relieve himself (of wind), there's no need for him to be ashamed. Personally I think there's nothing worse than holding it in. And I never forbid anyone to relieve himself of wind even in the dining-room, and doctors forbid people to hold it in as well.\\")  Etymology  The antiquity of pƒìd≈ç and its membership in the core inherited vocabulary is clear from its reduplicating perfect stem. It is cognate with Greek (perdomai), English fart, Bulgarian prdi, Polish pierdzieƒá, Russian –ø–µ—Ä–¥–µ—Ç—å (perdet), Lithuanian persti, Sanskrit pardate, and Avestan p…ôr…ôŒ¥aiti, all of which mean the same thing. Vissƒ´re is clearly onomatopoeic. The Old Norse fisa may be compared,Oxford Latin Dictionary. although the correspondence in sounds is not exact.  In the Romance languages and English  Pƒìdere and pƒìditum survive in Romance. In French, the noun pet from pƒìditum and the derived verb p√©ter (for earlier poire from pƒìdere) are very much alive. In Catalan, the verb is petar-se and the noun is pet. In Spanish the noun pedo as well as the verbs peerse and pedorrear are similarly derived. Portuguese peido and peidar(-se), (-dei) and Galician peido and peidar(se) are related. Italian peto is less common than scorreggia and its derived verb scorreggiare, but in Neapolitan pireto is frequently used. The English word petard, found mostly in the clich√© \\"hoist with his own petard\\", comes from an early explosive device, the noise of which was likened to that of farting. English also has petomania for a musical performance of breaking intestinal wind, and petomane for the performer, after Le P√©tomane, a French performer active in the early 20th century.These terms are not yet recognised by the OED, but featured in an article in The Guardian in the 1960s, and are discussed. Vissƒ´re, though rare in Latin texts, has derivates in several Romance languages, such as Romanian be»ô√≠ (verb) and be»ô√≠nƒÉ (noun);Diccionario etimologico rumano (Alejandro Cioranescu, 1958-66) French vesse (noun) and vesser (verb).Dictionnaire de fran√ßais LarousseFurther details are given at Laudator Temporis Acti blogspot  Mingere and meiere: urination  Ming≈ç (infinitive mingere) and mei≈ç (infinitive meiere) are two variant forms of what is likely a single Latin verb meaning \\"to urinate\\", or in more vulgar usage, \\"to take a piss.\\" The two verbs share a perfect mixƒ´ or mƒ´nxƒ´, and a past participle mictum or minctum. It is likely that ming≈ç represents a variant conjugation of mei≈ç with a nasal infix. In Classical Latin, the form ming≈ç was more common than mei≈ç. In some Late Latin texts a variant first conjugation form meiƒÅre is attested. This is the form that is productive in Romance. The Classical Latin word micturƒ´re became the accepted medical word meaning \\"to urinate\\". It is the source of the English medical term \\"micturition reflex\\".  Usage  Martial's epigram 3.78 uses meiere and ≈´rƒ´na to make a bilingual pun: : mƒ´nxistƒ´ currente semel, Paulƒ´ne, carƒ´nƒÅ. meiere vƒ´s iterum? iam 'Palin≈´rus' eris. :: (\\"Once you pissed off the side of a boat, Paulinus. Do you want to piss again? then you will be Palinurus.\\") (Note that palin is a Greek word meaning \\"once again.\\" Palinurus was Aeneas's navigator who was thrown overboard in the Aeneid.) The verbs meiere and mingere could also be used euphemistically of sexual intercourse.Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary. Horace (Satires 1.2.44), speaking of the punishments meted out to adulterers, says: :hunc permƒ´nxƒìrunt cƒÅl≈çnƒìs; quƒ´n etiam illud accidit, ut cuidam testƒ´s caudamque salƒÅcem dƒìmeterent ferr≈ç. ::(\\"One got thoroughly 'pissed on' (i.e. raped) by the servants; it even happened once that they cut off someone's balls and lecherous 'tail' with a knife.\\") Catullus (67.23) speaks of a father who \\"pissed in the lap of his own son\\" (ipse suƒ´ gnƒÅtƒ´ mƒ´nxerit in gremium), that is, had sex with his son's wife.  Urine  The most usual word for urine was ≈´rƒ´na, which is attested in Latin as early as Cicero, and became the usual polite term. The relationship with the Greek verb (oure≈ç), \\"to urinate\\", is not clear. In Classical Latin, however, the verb ≈´rƒ´nƒÅrƒ´ meant \\"to dive into water\\", and ≈´rƒ´nƒÅtor was \\"a diver\\", ≈´rƒ´nantƒìs \\"those who dive\\". Catullus (37) writes contemptuously of a certain Spaniard who was one of the lovers of his girlfriend Lesbia: :t≈´ praeter omnƒìs ≈´ne de capillƒÅtƒ´s, cunƒ´cul≈çsae Celtiberiae fƒ´lƒ´, EgnƒÅtƒ´. opƒÅca quem bonum facit barba et dƒìns HibƒìrƒÅ dƒìfricƒÅtus ≈´rƒ´nƒÅ. ::(\\"You above all, one of the long-haired ones, son of rabbit-filled Celtiberia, Egnatius, made handsome by your dark beard, and your teeth brushed clean with Iberian piss.\\") Another word for urine, but less commonly used, was l≈çtium. This word relates to lavƒÅre, \\"to wash\\". The Romans, innocent of soap, collected urine as a source of ammonia to use in laundering clothes. The early agricultural writer Cato, an advocate of cabbage, used this word when he wrote (Res Rustica 156): :brassica alvum bonum facit l≈çtiumque ::(\\"Cabbage is good for the digestion and for the urine.\\")  Etymology  Meiere is an inherited Indo-European word. It relates to Sanskrit mehati, \\"urinates\\", Persian mƒ´z, \\"urine\\", Lithuanian my≈æa, \\"he/she urinates\\", Greek (omeikhein), \\"to urinate\\", which, taken together, point to an Indo-European *h3meiƒ£h-. This IE root with a palatal ƒ£h was formerly mixed up (e. g. in Pokorny's IEW) with another one with velar *gh meaning \\"mist\\" (Russian mgla), hence erroneous tentative overall translations like \\"to sprinkle\\" or \\"to wet\\" which still turn up sometimes.  In the Romance languages  Though mingere and meiere are the Classical Latin forms, meiƒÅre seems to have been the popular form in Late Latin. This underlies Galician mexar, Portuguese mijar, and Spanish mear. *PissiƒÅre represents a borrowing from the Germanic languages, and appears elsewhere in the Romance territory, as in French pisser, Catalan pixar, Italian pisciare and Romanian a (se) pi»ôa, along with English to piss.  Latin words relating to prostitution  Compared to the anatomical frankness of the Roman vocabulary about sexual acts and body parts, the Roman vocabulary relating to prostitution seems euphemistic and metaphorical. Prostitutes were called meretrƒ´x, \\"earner\\", and lupa, \\"she-wolf\\"; a brothel was a lupƒÅnar; these words referred to the mercantile and perceived predatory activities of prostitutes. The Latin verb pr≈çst≈ç meant \\"to be up for sale\\" and pr≈çstitu≈ç meant \\"to expose for public sale.\\" The poet Juvenal (6.120-3) describes how the disgraced Empress Messalina used to enjoy playing the part of a prostitute in a brothel: :sed nigrum flƒÅv≈ç crƒ´nem abscondente galƒìr≈ç intrƒÅvit calidum veterƒ´ cent≈çne lupƒÅnar et cellam vacuam atque suam; tunc n≈´da papillƒ´s pr≈çstitit aurƒÅtƒ´s titulum mentƒ´ta Lyciscae ::(\\"But hiding her black hair with a yellow wig, wearing an old patchwork cloak, she entered the hot brothel and an empty cell of her own; then she offered herself for sale nude with her nipples covered in gold, using the false name of 'Lycisca'.\\") The pimp or pander in charge of the brothel, who dismissed the girls at closing time, was called lƒìn≈ç if male (Juvenal 6.127) and lƒìna if female. The neuter word scortum could refer to either a male or female prostitute.Taylor (1989), p. 358. This word may relate to Latin scorteus, \\"made of leather or hide\\", much as English refers to the skin trade. Lewis and Short quote Varro: pellem antƒ´quƒ´ dƒ´cƒìbant scortum (\\"in the old days people referred to skin as scortum\\"). Another word for a male prostitute, notably one who is no longer a boy, is exolƒìtus (literally \\"grown up, adult\\").Taylor (1989), p. 358. Cicero (pro Milone, 21, 55) writes: :Cl≈çdius, quƒ´ semper sƒìcum scorta, semper exolƒìt≈çs, semper lupƒÅs d≈´ceret ::(\\"Clodius, who always used to take with him whores, and male and female prostitutes\\") The verb scortor, scortƒÅrƒ´, which occurs chiefly in Plautus, means \\"to go whoring\\" or \\"to employ prostitutes\\". Plautus illustrates its use in Asinaria: : quand≈ç mƒìcum pariter p≈çtant, pariter scortƒÅrƒ´ solent, hanc quidem, quam nactus, praedam pariter cum illƒ´s partiam. :: (\\"Whenever they go drinking with me, they also usually go whoring with me. So I'll share this booty which I've captured with them equally.\\") The important and productive words for a prostitute in Romance, *p≈´ta or *p≈´tƒÅna, are not attested in Classical Latin, despite their many Romance derivatives: French putain and pute, Italian puttana, Spanish, Filipino, Catalan, Portuguese and Galician puta. French linguists state that they relate to Latin p≈´te≈ç, p≈´tƒìre, \\"to stink,\\" and thus represent yet another metaphor.. Spaniards Mar√≠a Moliner (author of a famous dictionary of Spanish) and Joan Coromines think they came from Vulgar Latin *putta, feminine form of *puttus, an emphatic form of p≈´tus, \\"pure\\" or \\"boy\\". In Portugal, the word puto has the same connotation as \\"small kid\\" or \\"little boy\\"; in Brazil, on the other hand, it is slang for \\"pissed off\\" or enraged males in general or as a colloquial, mildly offensive term for male escorts (more formally called prostitutos or mich√™s) ‚Äì the male counterpart of the slang puta, with the same meanings.  In popular culture  The HBO/BBC2 original television series Rome depicts the city with the grit and grime that is often absent from earlier productions, including that of language. But since the actors speak English, Latin profanity is mostly seen in written graffiti, such as: * ATIA FELLAT, \\"Atia sucks\\"; \\"fellatio\\" is a noun derived from this verb. * ATIA AMAT OMNES, \\"Atia loves all [men]\\". Thus calling her a whore or slut. * CAESARI SERVILIA FUTATRIX, \\"Servilia is Caesar's bitch\\".  See also  * Vulgar Latin * Sexuality in ancient Rome * Homosexuality in ancient Rome  Bibliography  Primary literary sources are discussed in the text.

These \\"codfish\\" bills, so-called because of the cod in the border design, were engraved and printed by Paul Revere.Newman, The Early Paper Money of the America, 185‚Äì86. The pound was the currency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its colonial predecessors until 1793. Like the British pound sterling of that era, the Massachusetts pound was subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence, but the Massachusetts and British pounds were not equivalent in value. British and other foreign coins were widely circulated in Massachusetts, supplemented by the pine tree shilling produced by the \\"Hull Mint\\" between 1652 and 1682 and by local paper money from 1690. The paper money issued in colonial Massachusetts was denominated in pounds, shillings, and pence. Initially, six shillings were equal to one Spanish dollar. After years of high inflation, in 1749 Massachusetts withdrew its paper money from circulation and returned to specie. Massachusetts once again began issuing paper money after the American Revolutionary War began in 1775. The state currency depreciated greatly and was replaced by the U.S. dollar in 1793. Coins Silver pine tree shilling, dated 1652. Shillings were issued in denominations of 3 and 6 pence and 1 shilling. The first pieces bore the letters \\"NE\\" and the denomination \\"III\\", \\"VI\\" or \\"XII\\". The coins (the pine tree shillings) were smaller than the equivalent sterling coins by 22.5%.N E Coinage Introduction Later pieces, struck between 1652 and 1660 or 1662, bore the image of a willow tree,Willow Tree Introduction with an oak treeOak Tree Introduction appearing on coins produced between 1660 or 1662 and ca. 1667. However, the most famous design was the final one to be issued, the pine tree type, struck between ca. 1667 and 1682.Pine Tree Coinage Introduction The coins circulated widely in North America and the Caribbean. The shillings nearly all bore the date \\"1652\\". This was the date of the Massachusetts Bay Colony legislation sanctioning the production of shillings. The date was maintained by the Massachusetts moneyers in order to appear to be complying with English law that reserved the right of produce shillings to the crown, since, in 1652, England was a Commonwealth (King Charles I having been beheaded three years previously). The shillings were struck by John Hull and Robert Sanderson, two Massachusetts settlers. The image of the pine tree on the later coins may symbolize an important export for Massachusetts - pine trees for ships' masts.NMAH Legendary Coins & Currency: Massachusetts the pine tree shilling, \\"1652\\" (struck 1667-1674) The \\"Hull Mint\\" producing the pine tree shillings was closed by the English government in 1682. Paper money Two shilling note, dated 1 May 1741. From 1690, paper money was issued, denominated in pounds, shillings and pence. The notes were printed from engraved copper plates (probably the work of silversmith Jeremiah Dummer). The pine tree shilling struck by \\"The Hull Mint\\" in Boston for the Massachusetts Bay Colony was initially worth 9 pence sterling. However, the value of this first issue of notes declined relative to silver coins and, in 1704, the \\"Old Tenor\\" notes were introduced, again at a value of 1 Massachusetts shilling = 9 pence sterling. The value of these notes also declined and they were followed, in 1737, by the \\"Middle Tenor\\" issue, worth 3 times the Old Tenor notes, and, in 1741, by the \\"New Tenor\\" issue, worth 4 times the Old Tenor notes. In 1759, all previous issues were replaced by the \\"Colonial\\" issue, worth 10 times the Old Tenor notes.

Life  Eduard Zimmermann was born on 4 February 1929 in Alte Heide in the borough of Schwabing-Freimann in Munich, Germany to a teenage mother who worked as a waitress. Shortly before the Second World War Zimmermann moved to his grandparents house in Ottobrunn. At the end of the war Zimmermann moved to the city of Magdeburg where his mother had married a hotelier, and where Zimmermann was first employed at his stepfather's hotel. Following the Second World War the man who would later be known as a 'criminal hunter' and 'crook's bane' eked out a living as a thief and black market trader, for which he served a sentence at Fuhlsb√ºttel Prison. With a false identity and diploma he finally found work as a roadworks engineer in Sweden. Zimmermann returned to the Soviet occupation zone in Germany on an assignment for Dagens Nyheter newspaper. There he was charged with espionage in 1950 and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He served five years of his sentence in Bautzen and was released early on 17 January 1954 under the Vierm√§chtekonferenz (Conference of the Four Powers). Subsequently he worked as a journalist and editor at NDR and ZDF. From 20 October 1967 to 24 October 1997 Zimmermann presented 300 episodes of the ZDF TV series Aktenzeichen XY... ungel√∂st (File Sign XY ‚Ä¶ Unsolved), whom he also co-hosted with his adopted daughter Sabine from 6 November 1987 until 24 October 1997 (Sabine would remain at the said programme until 7 December 2001), as well as 180 episodes from 1964 to 1997 of Vorsicht Falle! - Nepper, Schlepper, Bauernf√§nger (Beware, Trap! - Scammers, Hustlers, Conmen). He then retired from the television business and maintained an Internet security portal in co-operation with ZDF. Zimmermann was a co-founder of Wei√üer Ring e.V. (White Ring), an organisation that assists victims of crimes, and was its chairman for many years. On the occasion of Aktenzeichen XY's hundredth episode on 7 October 1977 Zimmermann received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany on ribbon, presented by Federal President Walter Scheel, and was subsequently awarded the Order of Merit First Class on 16 June 1986, presented by Federal President Richard von Weizs√§cker. In 1982 he received the Humanitarian Award of the German Freemasons.

This happens in a situation which cannot be remedied instantaneously but requires a solution over a long time, at times going on for years. With this procedural innovation of the writ of mandamus or a mandatory order, the court monitors compliance of its orders, seeking periodic reports from authorities on the progress in implementing them. It may enlist senior advocates to assist it as amicus curiae in court, or as court commissioners in the field, and subject experts or expert bodies to report back to it on the facts and ground-realities of the case. It may appoint a court committee or a court commission, independent from the executive, as its oversight or monitoring agency. It may require the subject-matter covered by the case, be taught in schools and universities, making it part of textbooks and syllabi, or be given wide publicity through the media. It may use contempt against people in positions of power or authority as a remedy in case of non- compliance or poor implementation of its orders. It may recommend that the legislature frame a policy in the matter, for the future. India The doctrine of continuing mandamus, first propounded in a case in the late 1970s, has been discussed and dealt with in the respective cases of Vineet Narain v. Union of IndiaVineet Narain v. Union of India, AIR 1996 SC 3386 and Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India & Ors.Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, AIR 1984 SC 802 It has been applied to cleaning the air around the Taj Mahal and the waters of the Ganga, and to mitigate travel conditions in commuter trains and road surface, traffic & vehicle conditions, in cities. As it essentially seeks to directly control the bureaucracy, bypassing the political regime, it has met with both, gradual success and stiff resistance, in India. If a case, prima facie, cannot be made out against an accused in a charge sheet, it is to be closed and quickly submitted to the court. The courts are not concerned with the accusations on merit, in such cases, but merely whether the agencies have investigated them expeditiously, and to their logical conclusion. Philippines The Manila Bay Case led to the formal placement of the procedural innovation of continuing mandamus in statute books in the Philippines, where it is being resorted to by litigants in other cases. South Africa The Constitutional Court of South Africa in 2002, recognised the need for structural interdicts in their supervisory jurisdiction, where declaratory orders go unheeded. This need should be coupled with a meaningful engagement of all the parties to the litigation in securing socio-economic rights. Canada Courts would give time to authorities for compliance, by suspending or delaying declarations of invalidity. In 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada in Doucet-Boudreau v Nova Scotia (Minister of Education) held that, in constitutional cases a court could keep the final outcome in a case pending in a post-judgment supervisory jurisdiction, and would not become functus officio. US Structural injunction, formulated possibly first by American courts, has been applied to try remedy schools, prisons, environmental cleanup and traditional rights of indigenous people.

With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 the immediate need for a considerable expansion of the British Army resulted in the formation of the New Army under Lord Kitchener. The war target was seventy divisions in all, the New Army to have thirty volunteer divisions separate and under Army Order 324, as additional from the Regular Army, with a planned period of service of at least three years. On 7 August a general United Kingdom-wide call for 100,000 volunteers aged 19‚Äì30 was issued. The battalions were to be distinguished by the word 'Service' after their number.Staunton, Martin: The Royal Munster Fusiliers (1914-1919) Ch. IV \\"The 6th, 7th Battalions, RMF\\" MA thesis at University College Dublin (1986). See under ext.-link: The Open LibraryStaunton, p.87 The first new battalions were raised as units of Kitchener's new K1 Army Group, which led to the formation of the 6th and 7th (Service) Battalions, Royal Munster Fusiliers (RMF) comprising the 30th Brigade of the 10th (Irish) Division, under the command of General Bryan Mahon. The 8th and 9th RMF (Service) Battalions followed as units of the 16th (Irish) Division's 47th and 48th Brigades, part of Kitchener's second new K2 Army Group, the 16th Division under the command of Major General William Hickie .Staunton, p.221 In the course of the war heavy losses suffered by the Regular RMF Battalions caused the new service battalions to be disbanded and absorbed in turn by the regular battalions, the last on 2 June 1918 when the 8th (Service) RMF was amalgamated with the 1st (Regular) RMF Battalion.

Kerry in August 1914 and moved to the Curragh as the 30th Brigade of their division for initial training and receiving recruits from the recruiting districts. An early problem was to find 29 sufficiently experienced officers for the battalions. By the time they transferred to Basingstoke England in May they had a variety of regular, retired and reserve officers designated from other battalions. Both battalions had their ranks further diversified, receiving surplus recruits from other British regiments, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers to the 6th RMF, Ulster recruits then numbering Munster recruits.Staunton, p.88-92 Gallipoli After very hard training, both battalions embarked on 9 July 1915 from Liverpool, disembarking on 19 July in Greece at Mudros on the Aegean island of Lemnos. Disease reduced battalion strength from 1000 to 800 even before the planned landing at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula.Staunton, p.94 The intention was to land north of the Turkish forces and cut them off, opening the way to Constantinople. The 1st Regular RMF had already been engaged in fighting with varying intensity since its landing in April. The 10th (Irish) Division landed at Suvla Bay on 7 August, already weakened by the fact that a number of its battalions had been landed on the wrong beaches. The tenth division was left with only five battalions, including the two RMFs, out of 13. Their objective was to capture the Kiretch Tepe Sirk ridge along the North side of the bay. The 6th landed first with 25 officers and 749 men, then the 7th with 28 officers and 750 men.Staunton, p.95 Retreat The 6th were raw troops in action for the first time in what was known as the Battle of Sari Bair Ridge. Held up by concealed trenches, lack of water, heat and exhaustion, they lost over 70 killed by dusk when they withdrew. Although they outnumbered the Turks, a further day was lost due to lack of leadership at Corps level, during which the enemy reinforced its position.Staunton, pp.96-7 The RMF attack resumed on 9. August but came to a halt at the bottom of the ridge. A naval bombardment failed its objectives. When scrub caught fire they withdrew and entrenched. Bitter cold nights made them retire to the beaches where 350 reinforcements arrived. On 15 August the 10th Division made its final thrust taking the north slope of the ridge costing the 6th RMF 43 killed, the 7th RMF in support lost 23 killed. The 6th held its position overnight under heavy bombardment, then had to withdraw next day.Staunton, pp.100-101 The ridge had been nearly captured, but by the 19. both battalions were down to half strength since landing. During the last offensive by the British forces in the Battle of Scimitar Hill on 21. August, the battalions played a supportive role, after which static trench warfare ensued to the end of September. Casualties from sickness now exceeded those from enemy action. The 10th (Irish) Division was withdrawn and embarked for Mudras on the 30., the 7th RMF with only 6 officers and 305 men, the 6th RMF with fewer than 450 men.Staunton, p.102 Serbia With the Bulgarian invasion of Serbia, both Greece and Serbia requested Allied help. In response the 10th (Irish) Division was shipped to Salonika for the Macedonian campaign.Staunton, p.104 The division received extensive training as well as reinforcements from non-regimental sources changing the character of the two battalions. Still wearing summer uniforms the severe snow and frost at high level caused many casualties. The Bulgarian forces made intensive progress and threatened the Anglo-French force, the 7th RMF in a front line position. At Kosturino it held the rearguard as the 10th Division, which included Connaught Rangers and Royal Dublin Fusiliers, was ordered to retreat at the end of December. Having failed to prevent the fall of Serbia, the Allied forces remained at Salonika, where during early 1916 the two RMF battalions were built up to strength again.Staunton, pp.105-07 Greece The Bulgarians, with German support, crossed the Greek frontier on 26 May. The 10th Division was first sent into action in August along the Struma River valley, coming into action against the Bulgarians on 30 September in the 'Struma offensive', crossing the river and taking the village of Yenikoi (present-day Provatas in Serres Prefecture, Greece),Fallingrain.com website then reoccupying it again after a Bulgarian counterattack, but at the cost of 500 men. Both RMF battalions crossed back on 15 October for a rest period. Now well below strength due to the malaria in summer and lack of recruits, it resulted in the amalgamation, on 3 November, of the 7th into the 6th RMF after they returned again to Yeninkoi. .Staunton, p.111 The division withstood further Bulgarian attacks in March 1917. In late summer the 10th was withdrawn to be deployed to stem the Turks on the Palestine front.Staunton, p.113 Palestine They embarked from Salonika on the 9. September 1917, arriving via Egypt in Ismalia on 12. September, October spent training after redress, entering the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. During the Battle of Gaza from the 27. October the 6th RMF were not greatly involved to their disappointment, the Turks withdrawing by 7 November. Following a refit the 10th Division returned to the line 25. November, the 6th RMF encountering considerable sniper fire on the way to the capture of Jerusalem, which was entered unopposed on 9. December. With relatively low losses the 6th RMF had taken what was asked of it. After so many defeats since Gallipoli, they were at last tasting victory. .Staunton, p.114 Into 1918 was spent on reconstruction work, when fighting flared up again in March requiring an advance towards Nablus. This enemy engagement was to be the last action in Palestine. France Heavy losses had been encountered on the Western Front after the great German March offensive, resulting in the transfer of 60,000 men from Palestine to France, their place taken by Indian battalions.Staunton, p.117 Ten battalions of the 10th (Irish) Division were included, the 6th RMF one of them. 35 officers and 812 other ranks embarked at Alexandria arriving Marseilles on 2. June. It was entrained for the journey northward, reaching Arques on 6. June, marching from there to the camp of the remaining 2nd Regular RMF which had suffered heavily in March and was at cadre level. The 2nd RMF was largely reconstructed with disbanded personnel of the 6th RMF. The remaining 6th RMF self at cadre strength, was assigned to instruct an American infantry brigade. After completion, they re-joined the 2nd RMF in Dieppe which was in reality the rebuilt 6th RMF. These had been a closely knit unit with relatively low losses since Gallipoli but were soon to suffer heavily in fierce combat during the Hundred Days Offensive and the final weeks before the Armistice in November 1918.Staunton, p.118 8th, 9th (Service) Battalions An Army Order 352 of 11 September 1914 authorised the formation of a second six divisions to be called the K2 Army Group of Kitchener's New Army, and included the 8th and 9th Munsters as battalions of the 16th (Irish) Division's thirteen battalions. The 16th Division officers were all former Regulars. This caused much controversy because experienced officers had previously been drafted to the 10th (Irish) Division and the fact that the 16th (Irish) Division in contrast to the 10th, was to be solely for recruits enlisting in Ireland. Other rebuffs were the rejection by the War Office of distinctive regimental colours and shamrock cap badges. This very much hampered recruitment to the Division.Staunton, Martin: The Royal Munster Fusiliers (1914-1919), Ch. VIII \\"The 8th, 9th Battalions RMF\\"Staunton, pp.214-16 8th (Service) Battalion This battalion was formed at Fermoy, in October 1914 and reserved for recruits from the Irish National Volunteers by order of the Secretary of State for War, as the 47th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. It also comprised the largest number of recruits from the County Limerick area. It moved to Mitchelstown in November 1914 where it was visited by the Belfast Nationalist M.P. Joseph Devlin. After a stay in Templemore from February 1915, it returned to Fermoy again in May 1915. Then in August it crossed over to Blackdown camp Aldershot, Hampshire, England, undergoing harder training.Staunton, pp.217-21 France Sailing from Southampton the 8th RMF landed in France with the 16th (Irish) Division under its new commander Major-General William Hickie on 19. December 1915 with 33 officers and 948 other ranks, going straight to the Winter trenches on the Loos salient, the front line of the earlier lost Battle of Loos, alongside the 15th (Scottish) Division.Staunton, pp.221-24 Casualties occurred throughout January. During February it was stationed at B√©thune for training, returning to the lines, rotating with the 9th RMF through April. In May its casualties were replenished by 12 officers and 200 men from the disbanded 9th Battalion. During June and July it took part on several raids along the Loos sector with its brigade, suffering significant losses, often the battalion's best soldiers. It left with the 16th Division for the Somme sector on 30 August 1916.Staunton, pp.226-35 Ginchy Its area of operation was to the front at Guillemont and Ginchy. It was part of the assault which took Guillemont on 3 September 1916 along with the Connaught Rangers. After the initial attack on Ginchy failed, it was left open to a counter-attack, then withdrawn to recover from its losses. It returned on 7 September 1916 with 200 men for the next attack on Ginchy. With inadequate cover, by 9 September 1916 it was inflicted with heavy casualties and was unable to bury its dead. The other battalions of the 16th (Irish) Division captured Ginchy. The Division was then transferred northwards to the Ypres salient. The 8th RMF was on rotating trench engagements with continual casualties up to 7. November 1916. It was disbanded with 21 officers and 446 other ranks on 22 November 1916, and its personnel drafted into the 1st RMF (Regular) Battalion which had returned from Gallipoli, just three weeks after the disbandment of the 7th RMF in Macedonia.Staunton, pp.235-37 9th (Service) Battalion The battalion was raised mostly in County Cork between late autumn 1914 and the spring of 1915, having the highest proportion of soldiers from the regimental county. The Independent Nationalist MP. for mid-Cork, Capt. D. D. Sheehan, played a considerable role as officer in its recruitment. After initial training at Kilworth near Buttevant it was stationed at Mallow then moved to Fermoy in June 1915, before crossing to Blackdown camp, Aldershot.Staunton, pp.220-21 France Landing in France on 29. December, it joined the 8th Battalion on the Loos Salient near Aire, described as 'hideous territory', suffering first casualties of its short history in January. Terrific artillery harassment followed right through March. Constant enemy activity, vile weather and appalling trench conditions greatly fatigued the battalion.Staunton, pp.222-23 Heavy losses were caused by mines and trench mortars. It endured a chlorine gas attack at the Battle of Hulluch in April. All enemy assaults were however repelled.Staunton, pp.227-28 The 9th spent its last tour of the trenches as a unit from 6‚Äì25 May. The manpower shortages in other RMF regiments necessitated the battalion's disbandment on 30 May. Being the last raised new battalion its personnel were drafted to the 1st, 2nd and 8th RMF Battalions.Staunton, pp.232-33 10th (Service) Battalion This was unusual in many respects. The initiative did not go out from the British Army, but from the West Clare M.P. Arthur Lynch whose intention was to raise a unit in 1918 which did not have the barriers against national identity which had affected the raising of the 16th Division. He had previously raised the Second Irish Brigade to fight for the Boers in the South African War, for which he had been sentenced to death by the British, which was later commuted. He then became involved in constitutional politics.Staunton, Martin: The Royal Munster Fusiliers (1914-1919), Ch. VI \\"The 10th (Service) Battalion RMF\\"Staunton, p.168 He campaigned to raise recruits separately from the British recruiting drive in Ireland, which caused much aggravation, putting many obstacles in his way, including having those he recruited diverted elsewhere and the familiar denial of concessions to Irish national sentiments. He only managed to get a special uniform approved for his six pipers, they were to be kilted, their hat badges with the design of an Irish Wolfhound rather than the traditional Munster's emblem of a Bengal tiger. The battalion was initiated on 18 September 1918 at Ballyvonare Camp, Buttevant, County Cork. It was to be officered only by men with front line experience. Col. Lynch had enlisted 29 men by 5 October and 77 by the middle of the month. He then visited the front in France, calling his unit \\"my nominal regiment\\", which made the battalions connection with the RMF tenuous, many of the RMF's prominent officers not knowing the RMF had a 10th battalion. Its numbers were never high, a recruit enlisting on 4 December was the 146th. The unit was not on active service, the Armistice removing any justification for its existence. It was disbanded 14 March 1919, Col. Lynch resigning his commission in April.Staunton, pp.169-171 Notes RMF (Regular) Battalions History of 1st and 2nd (Regular) Battalions related under *Royal Munster Fusiliers Reserve and Garrison Battalions History of 3rd (Reserve), 4th and 5th (Extra Reserve) Battalions History of 1st and 2nd (Garrison) Battalions related under *Royal Munster Fusiliers (Reserves) Great War Memorials * National War Memorial, Islandbridge Dublin. * Island of Ireland Peace Park Messines, Belgium. * Menin Gate Memorial Ypres, Belgium.

History  Montgomery had approached Bantam Books in the 1970s with his idea for \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" novels. Montgomery's initial books were popular, and the series took off with additional authors, with publication between 1978 and 1998, with over two hundred fifty million books sold in thirty-eight languages. In 2003, Montgomery and his wife Shannon Gilligan opted to form Chooseco to republish some of the classic titles of the series, create new titles, and option the franchise for other media.  Lawsuits  In March 2007, Chooseco filed a lawsuit against car manufacturer DaimlerChrysler, claiming that the company's advertising campaign for their Jeep Patriot model, bearing the tagline \\"Choose Your Adventure\\", infringed on Chooseco's trademarks. The suit was ultimately settled. Chooseco filed a similar trademark lawsuit in January 2019 against movie streaming platform Netflix following the release of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, an interactive film produced and released by Netflix that uses the \\"choose your own adventure\\" phrase. The company has also sent cease and desist notices to developers of indie video games on the itch.io storefront for using the term \\"choose your own adventure\\" to describe their game. Netflix has responded to Chooseco's suit with a number of defenses, including the assertion that the use of the term was artistic expression protected by the First Amendment (see Rogers v.

Route The route up Sani Pass starts at 1544 m, and climbs 1332 vertical metres to an altitude of 2876 m. The road is a steep gravel road with gradients up to 1:3, which can be difficult to drive in bad weather and may be covered with snow and ice in winter. By South African law only 4x4 vehicles are allowed on the road. Several tour operators run guided tours up and down the pass. The pass lies between the border controls of both countries and is approximately 9 km in length.The Sani Pass; gateway between the Southern Drakensberg and Lesotho Caution must be exercised and motorists must be alert while navigating the pass as it has claimed many lives. Occasionally the remains of vehicles that did not succeed in navigating the pass's steep gradients and poor traction surfaces can be seen. Road upgrades The Sani Pass dirt road will be upgraded in two phases; phase 1 extending for 14 km from the P318 (Sani Pass) turnoff and finishing at the old Good Hope Trading Post, and phase 2 extending from kilometer 14 to kilometer 33, the summit of Sani Pass. Construction work for the first phase commenced in December 2006 and was completed in September 2012. An economic impact study for phase 2 was compiled in August 2011. and its environmental impact assessment was compiled in October 2011. On 2 July 2013 the South African Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism approved the execution of phase 2 of the project, with the ultimate objective to re-gravel the final 5 km of the pass. The department also authorized plans to upgrade the storm-water drainage system and retaining walls along the route to reduce sand and gravel erosion. On 21 May 2014 the South African Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, approved the execution of phase 2. Tarring was planned to start within five months following the announcement and would bring the total cost of the project to R887-million. In July 2015 it was stated that phase 2 shall be completed in 2019. Border regulations While South African emigration at the bottom of the pass prohibits vehicles deemed unsuitable for the journey, the Lesotho border agents at the summit generally allow vehicles of all types to attempt the descent. The pass is often closed due to adverse weather conditions, especially during winter. The respective border control stations open at 6:00 and close at 18:00.DHA Webpage - South African Ports of entry The South African/Lesotho border is at the summit of the pass and not at the South African border control point.

It lies adjacent to the northeast side of Munich, and is one of the nearest suburbs to Munich's central district. History Before the establishment of Munich around 1158, an important crossing existed over the river Isar, the F√∂hringer Br√ºcke. Unterf√∂hring was mentioned in documents for the first time in 1180 as an independent place (inferius Feringin). Unterf√∂hring was part of the Prince- Bishopric of Freising. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803 the place belongs to Bavaria. In the course of the administrative reforms in Bavaria the today's municipality was created with the municipality edict of 1818. Economy Unterf√∂hring is one of the most important media centers of Germany. The 1950s saw the settlement of the RIVA photometric companies. In 1962 the Bavarian broadcaster (BR) and ZDF took over RIVA Studios. In 1972, Taurus films, the later Kirch Group, was founded. Since 2000, ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG is also based here. In addition, Sky Deutschland and Vodafone Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operators in Germany, have their headquarters in the city. One of the largest independent film production companies in Germany, the Neue Deutsche Filmgesellschaft, has their head offices here. Unterf√∂hring is also the location of MX1 (previously SES Platform Services, now part of SES Video) which provides signal processing and distribution for television and radio stations, and broadcast data services. Besides media enterprises, major insurance companies are situated east of the rapid-transit railway line S8 in the trade area of Unterf√∂hring. The largest employer is Allianz SE with approximately 6,000 workers. Another employer is the AGIS Allianz Dresdner Information Systems GmbH, an IT service provider and subsidiary of Allianz SE, with a large computing center. Other subsidiaries of the Allianz company are also located in Unterf√∂hring. Also in the vicinity is Swiss Re Life, Unicredit and Health Germany, part of the Swiss Re family of companies, with approximately 600 employees. Owing to the many corporate enterprises, the municipality is free from debt and even has accumulated a large reserve. Sports Unterf√∂hring is the smallest community in Germany with an own Rugby union club. The RC Unterf√∂hring e.V. was founded in 2012 and already fields two XVs in the 2nd Bundesliga and in the Verbandsliga Bayern. After its promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga in 2017 it became the first club in German rugby history to ever come from a village and play in Rugby-Bundesliga.

The band cite their influences as Depeche Mode, a-ha, Pet Shop Boys and New Order. In summer 2000 the band decided not to return to school. Paal's bedroom was traded for a workspace outside Bergen, in a decaying factory building. The units surrounding Lorraine's studio were filled with either crackheads or car mechanics. Without heating, the studio became cold, resulting in floppy discs freezing into the band's sampler. The band remained there for twelve months. The trio would record a rock song one day, a pop song the next, then a trip hop track the day after that. Some days they would start with a lyric, others with a bassline, or a keyboard riff. Their first releases was two 7\\" singles \\"Twenty Years Under Water\\" and \\"Lovesongs For An Ugly Girl\\" with remix of Twenty Years Under Water made by Paal as b-side . The song \\"Twenty Years Under Water\\" was put on a compilation \\"This is Norway\\". After this, in 2003, the band released their first CD - Lorraine EP featuring new song \\"Echoes\\". This was the first Lorraine's steps. In the same year, they were able to release their debut album. They reworked songs \\"Twenty Years Under Water\\" & \\"Sold Out\\" for album, so their sound \\"grew up\\" and became more professional. Lorraine have been described as an electronic rock'n roll band. Their music is filled with plenty of references to the modern rock and electronica scene. In Norway the press have been throwing superlatives at Lorraine's first album. The Perfect Cure is produced by Bjarte Ludvigsen and is mixed by Nille Perned (The Wannadies, Bob Hund and Kent). This album was inspired by such bands as Placebo, The Cure, The Smiths, Joy Division, Prodigy and others. Lorraine have already toured in Europe; in 2003 they have done 100 concerts in countries like France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Norway.

The main offices are located in Swiftwater in Monroe County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The forest is in several tracts in Monroe and Pike counties. Northampton County is also in District #19. History Delaware State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to- late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system.

History Possibly the earliest publication of the tune with words occurs in Walter Jekyll's 1907 book, Jamaican Song and Story, as item 121, pages 219-220. In Jekyll, the lyrics are as follows: :Carry me ackee go a linstead market :not a quatee wud sell :carry me akee go a linstead market not a quatee wud sell :oh lawd! what a night! what a night! what a saturday night! :etc... In Helen H. Roberts' collection of folk song variants based on field work in Jamaica, published in 1925, the version in Jekyll is reproduced, followed by twelve variants. In some of these, \\"Sollas market\\" replaces \\"Linstead market\\". (Sollas market became Jubilee Market, located on West Queen Street in Kingston.) For example, Roberts includes a version as sung in Christiana: > Sold me ackee, go to Sollas market. > Not a quatty would sell. > Sold me ackee, go to Sollas market. > Not a quatty would sell. > So whole o' Saturday night, > so not a light, not a bite. > So not a quatty would sell. > In 1975, Oxford University Press published \\"Linstead Market\\" in Olive Lewin's collection of Jamaican folk-songs, with these words: > Carry me ackee go a Linstead market, > Not a quatty wut sell, > Carry me ackee go a Linstead market, > Not a quatty wut sell. > Lawd wat a night, not a bite, > Wat a Satiday night. > Lawd wat a night, not a bite, > Wat a Satiday night. > On page 14, Dr. Lewin explains that \\"Linstead Market still remains a picturesque small town market. The song is now often taken at a much faster pace for dancing but was originally sung slow and plaintively by a mother who couldn't sell enough at the market to feed her children. A quatty was a small copper coin of very small value.\\" Note: A quatty(or quattie) was actually one and one-half penny(halfpenny). During that time it was standard to sell goods in quatty(s) worth, which was 1.5 penny in value. If an item increased in value, then the quantity you received for a quatty would decrease. The quattie was not a minted coin. Three halfpenny(ha'penny) or six farthing would be the equivalent of one quatty. In all the versions mentioned above except the earliest, the melody is written in 2/4 or 4/4 time, but in Jekyll, the time signature is 6/8. The melody has been arranged for solo voice with piano. One of the earliest such publications was \\"Linstead Market: a Jamaican Folk-song,\\" by Arthur Benjamin, Boosey & Hawkes, 1947 (5 pages). Among choral arrangements is one of the same title by A. H. Green, published by Oxford University Press in 1967 (8 pages). The song was included on the compact disc \\" The King's Singers in 1992. The song was recorded by the English folk group The Spinners, sung by their Caribbean singer Cliff Hall. The song is also published in modern collections, such as Songs of the Americas, arranged by Margery Hargest John, published by Boosey & Hawkes, London, 1993. More recently, published in January 2014, the album by Monty Alexander, titled \\"Harlem-Kingston Express, Vol. 2: The River Rolls On\\", contains track #11, \\"Linstead Market (Live Bonus)\\". It is 6:37 long and features a spoken introduction. Liner notes of the album by Monty Alexander reference the track by stating, \\"... this beloved old Jamaican folk song from way before my time, is one of the staples of the Mento repertoire.\\" The track was recorded by Rob Macomber in 2012 at Dizzy's Club Coca Cola in NYC.

His wife, then a semi-invalid, began to look into the new religion. In 1886, she received a copy of the Christian Science textbook, which she studied and saw her health restored. This led Hanna to begin his own investigation of the religion. His reading left him impressed with what he saw as its logic, but he was unable to grasp the book's meaning in its entirety. Although the drier Colorado climate had alleviated some of his health problems, he was not completely recovered. A woman living in New Hampshire helped him in Christian Science and he recovered, becoming so impressed with the experience, that he began a \\"systematic study\\" of the religion's textbook.

Synthesis gas is a useful product, but requires careful handling due to its flammability and the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. The water-gas shift reaction can be used to oxidise the carbon monoxide while producing additional hydrogen, resulting in water gas. Production Synthesis gas is made by passing steam over a red-hot carbon fuel such as coke: :{H2O} + C -> {H2} + CO \\\\ (\\\\Delta \\\\mathit{H} = +131 kJ/mol) The reaction is endothermic, so the fuel must be continually re-heated to keep the reaction going. In order to do this, an air stream, which alternates with the vapor stream, is introduced for the combustion of carbon to take place. :O2{} + C -> CO2 \\\\ (\\\\Delta \\\\mathit{H} = -393 kJ/mol) Theoretically, to make 6 L of water gas, 5 L of air is required. Or, alternatively, to prevent contamination with nitrogen, energy can be provided by using pure oxygen to burn carbon into carbon monoxide. :O2{} + 2 C -> 2 CO \\\\ (\\\\Delta \\\\mathit{H} = -221 kJ/mol) In this case 1 L of oxygen will create 5.3 L of pure water gas. History The water-gas shift reaction was discovered by Italian physicist Felice Fontana in 1780. Water gas was made in England from 1828 by blowing steam through white-hot coke. Lowe's gas process In 1873, Thaddeus S. C. Lowe developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could be generated for residential and commercial use in heating and lighting. This gas provided a more efficient heating fuel than the common coal gas, or coke gas, which was used in municipal service. The process used the water-gas shift reaction: :CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 The process was discovered by passing high- pressure steam over hot coal, the major source of coke gas. Lowe's process improved upon the chimney systems by which the coal could remain superheated, thereby maintaining a consistently high supply of the gas. The reaction produced carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which, after a process of cooling and \\"scrubbing\\", produced hydrogen gas. The process spurred on the industry of gas manufacturing, and gasification plants were established quickly along the Eastern seaboard of the United States. Similar processes, like the Haber‚ÄìBosch process, led to the manufacture of ammonia (NH3) by the combining of nitrogen, found in air, with hydrogen. This spurred on the refrigeration industry, which long used ammonia as its refrigerant. Prof. Lowe also held several patents on artificial ice making machines and was able to run successful businesses in cold storage, as well as products which operated on hydrogen gas. Variations Carburetted water gas Water gas has a lower heat of combustion than coal gas, so the calorific value was often boosted by passing the gas through a heated retort, into which oil was sprayed. The resulting mixed gas was called carburetted water gas. The average composition of carburated water gas is as follows: H=34-38%; CO=23-28%; saturated hydrocarbon=17-21%; unsaturated hydrocarbon=13-16%; CO=0‚Ä¢2-2‚Ä¢2%; N=2‚Ä¢5-5‚Ä¢0%. It is used as a source of heat since it has a high calorific value Semi- water gas Semi-water gas is a mixture of water gas and producer gas made by passing a mixture of air and steam through heated coke. The heat generated when producer gas is formed keeps the temperature of the coke high enough to allow water gas to be formed. Water gas shift reaction Pure hydrogen can be obtained from water gas by using the water-gas shift reaction, after subsequent removal of the carbon dioxide formed when carbon monoxide reacts with water.

humor or flatulence humour refers to any type of joke, practical joke device, or other off-color humor related to flatulence. History Although it is likely that flatulence humor has long been considered funny in cultures that consider the public passing of gas impolite, such jokes are rarely recorded. Two important early texts are the 5th century BC plays The Knights and The Clouds, both by Aristophanes, which contain numerous fart jokes. Another example from classical times appeared in Apocolocyntosis or The Pumpkinification of Claudius, a satire attributed to Seneca on the late Roman emperor: He later explains he got to the afterlife with a quote from Homer: Lucas Cranach, commissioned by Martin Luther.Luther's Last Battles: Politics And Polemics 1531-46 By Mark U. Edwards, Jr. Fortress Press, 2004. Title: Kissing the Pope's Feet.In Latin, the title reads \\"Hic oscula pedibus papae figuntur\\" German peasants respond to a papal bull of Pope Paul III. Caption reads: \\"Don't frighten us Pope, with your ban, and don't be such a furious man. Otherwise we shall turn around and show you our rears.\\"\\"Nicht Bapst: nicht schreck uns mit deim ban, Und sey nicht so zorniger man. Wir thun sonst ein gegen wehre, Und zeigen dirs Bel vedere\\"Mark U. Edwards, Jr., Luther's Last Battles: Politics And Polemics 1531-46 (2004), p. 199 Archeologist Warwick Ball asserts that the Roman Emperor Elagabulus played practical jokes on his guests, employing a whoopee cushion-like device at dinner parties.Warwick Ball P412, Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire Routledge, 2001 In the translated version of Penguin's 1001 Arabian Nights Tales, a story entitled \\"The Historic Fart\\" tells of a man who flees his country from the sheer embarrassment of farting at his wedding, only to return ten years later to discover that his fart had become so famous, that people used the anniversary of its occurrence to date other events. Upon learning this he exclaimed, \\"Verily, my fart has become a date! It shall be remembered forever!\\" His embarrassment is so great he returns to exile in India. In a similar vein, John Aubrey's Brief Lives recounts of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford that: \\"The Earle of Oxford, making his low obeisance to Queen Elizabeth, happened to let a Fart, at which he was so abashed and ashamed that he went to Travell, 7 yeares. Upon his return home, the Queen greeted him, reportedly saying \\"My Lord, I had forgot the Fart.\\" One of the most celebrated incidents of flatulence humor in early English literature is in The Miller's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer, which dates from the 14th century; The Summoner's Tale has another. In the first, the character Nicholas sticks his buttocks out of a window at night and humiliates his rival Absolom by farting in his face. But Absolom gets revenge by thrusting a red-hot plough blade between Nicholas's cheeks (\\"ammyd the ers\\") The medieval Latin joke book Facetiae includes six tales about farting. Fran√ßois Rabelais' tales of Gargantua and Pantagruel are laden with acts of flatulence. In Chapter XXVII of the second book, the giant, Pantagruel, releases a fart that \\"made the earth shake for twenty-nine miles around, and the foul air he blew out created more than fifty-three thousand tiny men, dwarves and creatures of weird shapes, and then he emitted a fat wet fart that turned into just as many tiny stooping women.\\"Fran√ßois Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel. W.W. Norton & Co. 1990, p.214 The plays of William Shakespeare include several humorous references to flatulence, including the following from Othello: Benjamin Franklin, in his open letter \\"To the Royal Academy of Farting\\", satirically proposes that converting farts into a more agreeable form through science should be a milestone goal of the Royal Academy.Benjamin Franklin, To the Royal Academu of Farting , c. 1781, at teachingamericanhistory.org In Mark Twain's 1601, properly named [ Date: 1601.] Conversation, as it was the Social Fireside, in the Time of the Tudors, a cupbearer at Court who's a Diarist reports: The Queen inquires as to the source, and receives various replies. Lady Alice says: In the first chapter of Moby Dick, the narrator states: Inculpatory pronouncements The sourcing of a fart involves a ritual of assignment that sometimes takes the form of a rhyming game. These are frequently used to discourage others from mentioning the fart or to turn the embarrassment of farting into a pleasurable subject matter.Blank, Trevor J. \\"Cheeky Behavior: The Meaning and Function of 'Fartlore' in Childhood and Adolescence.\\" Children's Folklore Review Vol. 32 (2010): 61‚Äì85. The trick is to pin the blame on someone else, often by means of deception, or using a back and forth rhyming game that includes phrases such as the following:Blank (2010), pp. 68‚Äì69. *He who declared it blared it. *He who observed it served it. *He who detected it ejected it. *He who rejected it respected it. *He who smelt it dealt it. *He who denied it supplied it. *He who said the rhyme did the crime. *He who accuses blew the fuses. *He who pointed the finger pulled the trigger. *He who articulated it particulated it. *He who introduced it produced it. *He who inculpated promulgated. *He who deduced it produced it. *He who was a smart-ass has a fart-ass. *He who sniffed it biffed it. *He who eulogized it aerosolized it. *He who sensed it dispensed it. *He who rapped it cracked it. *He who policed it released it. *Whoever rebuts it cuts it. *Whoever said the rap did the crap. *Whoever had the smirk did the work. *Whoever spoke it broke it. *Whoever asked it gassed it. *Whoever started it farted it. *Whoever explained it ordained it. *Whoever thunk it stunk it. *Whoever is squealing is concealing. *Whoever thought it brought it. *Whoever gave the call gassed us all. *He who circulated it perpetrated it. *Whoever spoke last set off the blast. *The smeller's the feller. *The one who said the verse just made the atmosphere worse. *Whoever's poking fun is the smoking gun. *It twas the thinker who loosened his sphincter. *etc. Assigning blame to another can backfire: a joke about royalty has the Queen emitting flatulence, and then turning to a nearby page, exclaiming, \\"Arthur, stop that!\\" The page replies, \\"Yes, Your Majesty. Which way did it go?\\" Practical jokes A ' is a slang term for lying in bed with another person and pulling the covers over the person's head while flatulating, thereby creating an unpleasant situation in an enclosed space. This is done as a prank or by accident to one's sleeping partner. The book The Alphabet of Manliness discusses the Dutch oven and a phenomenon it refers to as the \\"Dutch oven surprise\\", that \\"happens if you force it too hard\\".\\"If you happen to be in bed sleeping with someone, what you do is drop the nastiest, juiciest broccoli fart under the covers. Then while your partner is still sleeping, lift the covers over her head and then wait until the fart dissipates.\\" Maddox. The Alphabet of Manliness.

He is best known for his work for the publisher R. Talsorian Games, where he developed a majority of the company's role-playing game lines since the company's founding in 1982. Pondsmith is credited as an author of several RPG lines, including Mekton (1984), Cyberpunk (1988) and Castle Falkenstein (1994). He also contributed to the Forgotten Realms and Oriental Adventures lines of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, worked in various capacities on video games, and authored or co-created several board games. Pondsmith also worked as an instructor at the DigiPen Institute of Technology. Early life and education Born into a military family, Mike Pondsmith was the son of a psychologist and an Air Force officer, who traveled around the world with the U.S. Air Force for the first 18 years of his life. He graduated from the University of California, Davis with a B.A. in graphic design and a B.S. in behavioral psychology. Pondsmith recalls that he had been designing games even as a child, but it was not until college that he was introduced to the idea of pen and paper roleplaying games when a friend got a copy of the original Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;). Having a lot of naval wargaming experience, he became interested in the gameplay mechanics used by D&D; but not in the fantasy setting it presented. His interest spiked, however, when he acquired a copy of Traveller, a science fiction role-playing game published in 1977 by Game Designers' Workshop. Dissatisfied with its mechanics, Pondsmith rewrote the game for his personal use under the name Imperial Star. Pondsmith later called Traveller the best roleplaying game he had encountered in the Green Ronin's award-winning Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Early career Before he became a pen and paper game designer, Pondsmith worked in the video game industry as a graphic designer. His first job after college involved designing packaging and advertising materials for the now defunct California Pacific Computer Company (CPCC). Repackaging Japanese games for the Western world market was the main focus of CPCC in its early days. He later moved on to create designs for the original titles produced by Bill Budge and for the early Ultima games designed by Richard Garriott, all of which were published by CPCC. Pondsmith's job at CPCC ended because of problems the owner was having. Pondsmith began working at the University of California, Santa Cruz running a typesetting house. Pondsmith felt he could improve on the combat system of Traveller, and as a result he designed the game Imperial Star in the early 1980s purely for his own amusement. According to Pondsmith, there was not much to do in the area of video game design in the early 1980s due largely to the constraints of available technology. Most of the games released by CPCC were for Apple II machines. However, he was familiar with pen and paper games, which he played at the time, and became interested in paper game design. Thanks to his side-job in typesetting, he had access to very modern (for the time) computers with advanced software used in book and magazine layout. Taking advantage of this access, he wrote a game called Mekton, a mecha game based on Japanese manga books he had stumbled upon in the past. Due to the interest his work on paper games generated, game design consumed his graphic design career (although he continued designing and laying out most of the R. Talsorian Games' books). Early role-playing games The first game Pondsmith designed from the ground up was Mekton, a mecha game with heavy manga and anime influences, released in 1984. Pondsmith admitted that he was mostly basing his work on the Mobile Suit Gundam manga written in Japanese, which he had acquired. Not understanding the text, he inaccurately recreated the world dynamics purely from the imagery of the comic books. The game's first public testing occurred at a local convention. The initial public release of Mekton focused on its battle mechanics with no roleplaying elements at all; this made it a pure tactical war-game. The success of Mekton convinced Pondsmith that he could make a business out of game design, and he founded R. Talsorian Games (RTG) in 1985. In 1986, Mekton was re-released as a proper roleplaying game with Pondsmith and Mike Jones credited as authors. In 1987, RTG released another of Pondsmith's games inspired by the Japanese manga, Teenagers from Outer Space, (RPGA Gamer's Choice Award). In 1987, Pondsmith released Mekton II, a new edition of the system, featuring mechanics based on the Interlock System, later used with slight modifications in the Cyberpunk line. Teenagers from Outer Space was re-released with significant changes to the mechanics in 1989. Games such as Cyberpunk (later Cyberpunk 2020) and Cyberpunk V3 were translated into 9 languages. Castle Falkenstein (Best Game of 1994), Cybergeneration, and Dream Park soon followed. He also collaborated with the Hero Games designers on the Fuzion system. Cyberpunk roleplaying game In 1988 R. Talsorian Games released Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk The Roleplaying Game of the Dark Future. Set in the year 2013 (and often referred to as Cyberpunk 2013), the game was a boxed product consisting of three separate books penned by Pondsmith, with Mike Blum, Colin Fisk, Dave Friedland, Will Moss and Scott Ruggels as co-authors. Several expansions by Pondsmith and other authors followed and Pondsmith released Cyberpunk 2020, a handbook with an updated story arc and mechanics, (although existing expansions remained compatible with the new game) in 1990. Pondsmith designed Cyberpunk 2013 as the second game to use the Interlock system. Pondsmith attributes creation of Cyberpunk to his interest in the genre sparked primarily by Ridley Scott's Blade Runner released in 1982. The motivation behind the Cyberpunk roleplaying game was his desire to recreate the technology and dark, film noir style of the movie. Cyberpunk is the most expansive line of products in the RTG library with forty-four sourcebooks containing over 4,700 pages. The game has had an estimated 5 million players to date. In 1993, again under the RTG banner, Pondsmith released an alternate timeline for the Cyberpunk line. The sourcebook titled Cybergeneration was further enhanced by additional expansions and a second edition was released in 1995, that built further upon existing, explored themes. A license for the line was later acquired by Jonathan Lavallee, owner of Firestorm Ink, founded specifically to continue RTG's CyberGeneration product line in 2003. In 1996, Wizards of the Coast licensed Cyberpunk for their collectible card game Netrunner. Designed by Richard Garfield, Netrunner featured locations, entities, and characters familiar to Cyberpunk 2020 players. The game was named one of The Millennium's Most Underrated Games in 1999 in Pyramid magazine published by the Steve Jackson Games. Mike Pondsmith is featured in the game's credits in the 'special thanks' section and makes a cameo appearance as \\"Omni Kismet, Ph.D.\\" (character's name is an anagram of his). On May 10, 2012, Fantasy Flight Games announced that they would be releasing Android: Netrunner, a new card game based on Netrunner, under license from Wizards of the Coast. Another short-lived card game based on Pondsmith's IP was Cyberpunk CCG,designed by Peter Wacks, and published by Social Games in 2003. In 1989 West End Games released a Cyberpunk and Paranoia crossover. The game, called Alice Through the Mirrorshades, was designed by Edward Bolme and is compatible with both Cyberpunk and Paranoia games. At least two fan magazines were created around the time of Cyberpunk's peak popularity with Pondsmith's approval: Interface Magazine, which evolved from the unofficial Cyberpunk Update run by Chris Hockabout, and UK-published 'Punk '21. Castle Falkenstein In 1994, R. Talsorian Games released Pondsmith's steampunk- themed fantasy role-playing game titled Castle Falkenstein. The game's mechanics were based on playing cards, instead of dice, and geared towards live action role-playing. Castle Falkenstein remains Pondsmith's most critically acclaimed game to date with the 1994 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Rules, and the 1995 Nigel D. Findley Memorial Award for Best Role- Playing Product recognitions. In 2000, Castle Fankenstein was adapted to the GURPS system by James Cambias and Phil Masters, and released by Steve Jackson Games. Design contributions outside of R. Talsorian Games Pondsmith was briefly associated with TSR, Inc., where he worked on Buck Rogers XXVC, a science-fiction RPG, and two sourcebooks for the Dungeons & Dragons: Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms for Oriental Adventures in 1988 and Hall of Heroes for Forgotten Realms in 1989. He also made minor, uncredited contributions to the original Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game released in 1987 by West End Games. Pondsmith has also been president of GAMA (Game Manufacturers Association). In this role, in 1993, he arbitrated an out-of-court settlement between Palladium Books and Wizards of the Coast over Wizards' use of Palladium system integration notes in The Primal Order. R. Talsorian's hiatus and video game design The late 1990s had been difficult for the role-playing game industry and on February 15, 1998, Pondsmith announced that he was turning R. Talsorian into a part-time operation putting his major lines on hiatus. He ceased publication and distribution of Hero Games products and, in September 1998, they separated from RTG. In late 2000, Pondsmith accepted a job offer at Microsoft to produce Xbox games. As a design manager at Microsoft, he contributed to various games (mostly to the lineup of the original Xbox console's exclusive titles) released by the company's Microsoft Game Studios. In MechCommander 2, released in 2001, he played the role of Steel, a character featured in cut-scenes (he also voiced the character for the in-game chatter between characters). He was also credited in Stormfront Studios' Blood Wake released in the same year. The last Microsoft title he was credited with was Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge (2003). In 2004 he left Microsoft to join Monolith Productions where he worked on The Matrix Online (2005). During his time at Microsoft, his wife Lisa Pondsmith kept RTG alive by keeping some books in print and helping to publish a few new books. The idea of a Matrix game was initially pitched internally at Microsoft by Pondsmith and one of his coworkers. Despite advanced talks with the Wachowskis, the film's producers, the project never came to fruition. Pitches to Shiny Entertainment did not succeed either and he later learned that a Matrix game was being worked on at Monolith. Given the opportunity to join the live team (responsible for maintaining the game and producing content post-launch) he decided to join Monolith. Pondsmith ended up doing mission design for the game under the auspices of Online Creative Director and Lead Game Designer Toby Ragaini. Cyberpunk v3.0 In 2000 Pondsmith announced that he was working on the third edition of Cyberpunk. The work itself started even earlier, right after the release of the Dragon Ball Z Adventure Game in 1999; and the third edition of Cyberpunk was expected to ship soon afterwards. Initially called Cyberpunk 203X, the game was scheduled for a release in the spring of 2001. The first two-page preview of the game was released on August 20, 2001, marking the first pushback of the game's release date. During the prolonged development of the game, Pondsmith released another preview of the third edition of Cyberpunk on December 31, 2004. The game's early manuscript was previewed, and the first public playtesting took place during I-Con in Ronkonkoma, New York between April 8 and 10, 2005. The game was written by Pondsmith, Mike Blum, Colin Fisk, Dave Friedland, Will Moss, and Scott Ruggels and was finally released on December 13, 2005 to mixed reviews. Illustrations in the game were criticized, for being photographs of slightly modified action figures of which Pondsmith was a collector at the time. The game was successful enough, however, to justify several accessories and supplements which were announced immediately after the core book's release. This included DataPack (initially called Dossier Pak), FlashPak, Gangbook and AltCult Insider. Cyberpunk v3.0, much like its predecessors, was influenced by the classic cyberpunk books written by Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, but also incorporated ideas from new literary sources, Japanese animation, and movies. According to Pondsmith, it was designed to become a commentary on the 21st century, corporate influences on everyday life, ideologies of groups, the place of government, warfare and advancements in biotechnology. Interlock and Fuzion system In addition to working at RTG, Pondsmith contributed to the Hero Games' Champions line. Working mostly as an editorial assistant on books such as Alliances for the Champions: New Millennium, he was introduced to the Hero Games' mechanics (Hero System) which he later decided to merge with the Interlock System used by most of the RTG's games up to that point. The end result of this process was the Fuzion system used by the later RTG titles, most notably the third edition of the Cyberpunk game. In the foreword to the third edition of Cyberpunk, Pondsmith justified these changes as necessary for streamlining the game, and attracting new players. But like the game itself these were met with mixed reviews. The rights to Fuzion are jointly held by Pondsmith, along with Steve Peterson and Ray Greer of Hero Games. R. Talsorian Games R. Talsorian Games is a Washington-based roleplaying game publisher. Founded in 1985 in California by Mike Pondsmith, it was one of the first RPG publishers to embrace desktop publishing. Currently Lisa Pondsmith, Mike Pondsmith's wife, serves as a general manager of the company, with Mike Pondsmith remaining the owner, CEO and lead designer. Regarding the source of the name of the company, Pondsmith has stated that \\"R. Talsorian is a real person who never plays RPGs\\". In a 2016 interview he clarified that the name \\"R. Talsorian\\" derived from one of the company's investors, a \\"raisin farmer in Fresno.\\" A fellow game designer, Warren Spector, advised him to avoid naming his company after himself; Pondsmith and his associates heeded that advice by naming their company after \\"the one person who would never show up at a convention ever,\\" Talsorian. Maximum Mike Mike Pondsmith uses his alter- ego \\"Maximum Mike\\" across many of the Cyberpunk books. Unlike reoccurring characters like Morgan Blackhand, Johnny Silverhand or Nomad Santiago, Maximum Mike breaks the fourth wall and talks to the reader directly. Pondsmith's likeness and name, however, were used directly in the Cyberpunk world under different name; he is featured as \\"Omni Kismet, Ph.D.\\", one of the characters in the Netrunner CCG (character's name is an anagram of \\"Mike Pondsmith\\"). Cyberpunk 2077 On May 30, 2012, it was confirmed that Pondsmith was working with CD Projekt Red on a video game set in the Cyberpunk universe. On October 18, 2012, the game's name and settings were revealed to be Cyberpunk 2077. Immediately afterwards, Brian Crecente was able to confirm with the game's creators that Pondsmith was also working on a new edition of Cyberpunk pen and paper RPG game that would evolve the genre. In the interview for GameSpot, CD Projekt's Marcin Iwi≈Ñski divulged that Pondsmith's involvement in the video game development mostly focuses on the game world aspect and mechanics and his input, though constant, does not happen on a daily basis due to the distance between the parties. Video game creators as well as Mike Pondsmith and other RTG designers will contribute on the newly formed cyberpunk.net blog. Personal life Pondsmith has a wife, Lisa, and a son, Cody who both work at RTG. Although Mike and Lisa had met earlier, their relationship began around 1977 while both were still in college. They were married in February 1982. Lisa serves as a general manager of RTG and has been credited in various titles, most notably as author alongside Jeff Grubb of The Memoirs of Auberon of Faerie sourcebook for the Castle Falkenstein system; and Cody is credited as a member of the production staff in the Cyberpunk V3.0 supplement Flashpak. He was also involved in the promotion and community communications relating to RTG's steampunk title Castle Falkenstein. Before designing games, Mike Pondsmith worked as an amateur paleontologist. In his spare time he collects plastic GI Joe action figures, prominently featured in Cyberpunk v3.0 core rulebook, and enjoys outdoor activities, reading, as well as playing around with radio-controlled cars and planes. Public appearances Pondsmith has been very active in gaming communities and has appeared at many gaming conventions over the years. He was present at many of the Gen Cons which led to his memories of his experiences to be featured in Robin D. Laws' 40 Years of Gen Con published in August 2007 by Atlas Games. He attended I-CON, A-Kon, Norwescon, Origins, DexCon, DunDraCon and others. Pondsmith was a guest of honor at Ropecon 1999, Astronomicon 2001 and I-CON 25 (March 24‚Äì26, 2006). Both Mike and his son Cody run various games during different gaming conventions. Pondsmith also appeared on stage to talk about the Cyberpunk 2077 video game during two of the CD Projekt Red's conferences. Academic career Between years 2010 and 2011 Pondsmith was working in the Department of Game Software Design and Production at the DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, where he taught game design classes. The two courses he taught were Game History (GAT 110) and Game Mechanics I (GAT 210).

He rides next to Ilya Muromets in this 1898 painting by Viktor Vasnetsov. Mech-kladenets (. ) is a fabulous magic sword in Russian fairy tales and byliny, rendered \\"sword of steel\\", \\"hidden sword\\", or \\"magic sword\\" in English translations. The \\"self-swinging sword\\" or mech-samosek (also mech-samosyok, . ) is also regarded as equivalent by certain commentators, though others consider them to be distinct. Etymology Max Vasmer's dictionary defines kladenets as a \\"magic sword in Russian tales\\", and the sword kladenets has been translated \\"magic sword\\" in texts. The word \\"kladenets\\" can putatively be linked to the Slavic word klad () \\"treasure, hoard,\\" although \\"a number of philologists doubt\\" that this word-stem figures in the derivation of \\"[this] Russian epithet of this sword.\\" Some sources point out that kladenets, being a treasure, is frequently connected with the motif of being hidden inside a wall, under a rock, or under a sacred tree, waiting to be discovered by the bogatyr hero, and George Vernadsky goes as far as to translate kladenets as \\"the hidden sword\\".: \\"..'the hidden sword' (mech- kladenets).. this sword is usually represented as hidden under a rock, or under a sacred tree\\". Although Vernadsky fails to elaborate, an alternative etymology connects the term kladenets to klast' () \\"to lay or put\\", and his rendering lies in this camp. One rational explanation derives the word from uklad[ny] () \\"steel\\", hence kladenets is defined as meaning \\"made of steel\\" in the Dictionary of the Russian Language published by the Russian Academy of Sciences (and later in the Dictionary of archaic and obsolete words, published by Nauka)., Dictionary of the Russian Language, Volume 4: K‚ÄìKampilyt, p. 917. Quote: \\"–ø–æ –°–ª–æ–≤. –ê–∫–∞–¥. –∏ –î.

Another explanation, credited to Alexander Veselovsky (1888), theorizes that kladenets may be a corrupted pronunciation of Kgl'arentsya or Kgl'adentsya ( or ), the sword of . The Russian tale of Bova was adapted from the medieval Italian romance of Buovo d'Antona, in which the original sword name is or . This etymology has been endorsed by Max Vasmer's dictionary, under the entry that defines kladenets as a \\"magic sword in Russian tales\\", or \\"magic sword\\". The corrupted form mech-kolunets () is also attested. Attestations In some versions of the wonder-tale (skazka) on the bogatyr \\"Yeruslan Lazarevich\\", mech-kladenets is mentioned alongside the Firey Shield and Flame Spear ( )., reprinted Aegitas (2014). The sword is mentioned in passing in the tale Storm-Bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son (Afanasyev No. 136) but plays no significant role in the tale. Samosek While Vernadsky mentions \\"the self-swung sword\\" (mech-samosek) alongside mech-kladenets as commonplace elements in Russian folktales, he presents the swords as distinct from one another, since the kladenets sword needs to be wielded by a bogatyr.: \\"In Russian folk-lore, 'the self-swung sword' (mech-samosek), as well as 'the hidden sword' (mech-kladenets), is often mentioned.\\" Other sources however, present these two swords (mech-kladenets and mech-samosek) as equivalent, for example, a mythology dictionary with Yeleazar M. Meletinsky as supervising editor. The reasoning is not well-clarified, but this dictionary explains its view that kladenets (treasure) is often connected with the motif of being hidden inside a wall, and in the tale example it gives, the \\"Tale of the City of Babylon\\" (Skazanie o Vavilon√© grade ), the samosek-sword is also called \\"Asp The Serpent\\" (–ê—Å–ø–∏–¥-–∑–º–µ–π), and it was ordered hidden inside the wall by the sword's owner, Nebuchadnezzar..

It is served by the Adirondack. It has one low-level side platform with a small shelter on the east side of the track. History The Saratoga and Washington Railroad opened from Saratoga Springs, New York to Gansevoort on August 15, 1848, and on to Whitehall on December 10. The original terminus was just north of the village center at a dock on the Poultney River - the southern tip of Lake Champlain - thus establishing the railroad as a competitor to the Champlain Canal. A extension north to Lake Station on October 1, 1851 eliminated the need for ships to round a dangerous bend in the river. Whitehall station in July 1975 On October 1, 1850, the railroad opened a branch from just south of Whitehall to the Vermont state line near Fair Haven. Along with its Vermont subsidiary the Rutland and Whitehall Railroad (opened on November 1) and the Rutland and Washington Railroad (opened several weeks prior), this established a through rail route between Albany, New York and Rutland, Vermont. The railroad built a brick freight house and station at the junction in 1850. After a \\"complicated series of bankruptcies, reorganizations, leases, and sales\\", the railroads were consolidated under the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad in 1865, which in turn became part of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad (D&H;) on May 1, 1871. D&H; subsidiary New York and Canada Railroad opened from Lake Station to Rouses Point (where the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad connected to Montreal) on December 1, 1875, eliminating the need for Lake Station as a steamship terminal. The D&H; built a new station and freight house at Whitehall in 1892-93. In 1932, the D&H; realigned its mainline through Whitehall, with a short tunnel under the village center. The relocated tracks were slightly farther from the station, and a staircase connected the platform to the building. Passenger service on the Whitehall Branch to Rutland ended in 1936. Passenger service to Whitehall ended on April 30, 1971, as Amtrak did not continue D&H; passenger service when it took over intercity passenger trains the next day. Service resumed with the introduction of the Adirondack on August 5, 1974. The former station building was demolished by intentional burning on April 28, 1987.

Career A younger son of Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway, he attended Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. Entering politics, he was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Spalding in January 1910. Between 1910 and 1915, he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lewis Vernon Harcourt. Family On 20 July 1911, he married Barbara Jekyll, daughter of Colonel Sir Herbert Jekyll (KCMG) and the artist Dame Agnes Jekyll; they had two children: * Major Martin John McLaren (1914‚Äì1979) * Guy Lewis Ian McLaren (8 November 1915 ‚Äì 18 August 1978), married Maryse Jubin and had issue Military service and death Francis McLaren from the Roll of Honour published in The Illustrated London News on 8 September 1917 He volunteered at the outbreak of war and was commissioned with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.Western Front Association Bulletin No 58 dated October 2000 pp26-29 \\"Remembering 2/Lt The Hon. F.W.S. McLaren, M.P., R.F.C.\\" He served with Royal Naval Air Service's Armoured Car Division at Gallipoli. He contracted dysentery there and was eventually invalided out of the Royal Flying Corps on 30 December 1916. However, he appealed and returned to the RFC. McLaren was a second lieutenant and trainee pilot in Number 18 Training Squadron (RNVR) when he died on 30 August 1917, following a flying accident during training at RAF Montrose. His aeroplane, an AVRO 504A, nosedived into the sea off Montrose. He was pulled unconscious from the wreckage but died of internal injuries. He was buried in Busbridge churchyard, Godalming, Surrey on 5 September. His widow married Bernard Freyberg in 1922. Memorials McLaren's headboard, designed by Edwin Lutyens, in the churchyard at Busbridge Church He is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during the First World War to be named on that memorial. McLaren is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of McLaren. McLaren's grave at Busbridge Church is marked by a carved oak headboard, designed by Edwin Lutyens. The headboard is a Grade II listed building in its own right. He is buried alongside members of the Jekyll family. He is commemorated on Spalding War Memorial. The First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall in Spalding, Lincolnshire, was also designed by Lutyens. The proposal came from Barbara McLaren and most of the cost came from members of the McLaren and Jekyll families. It is listed Grade I.

Dotty Todd was born Doris Dabb in Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, on June 22, 1913. She studied the piano from an early age, giving a piano recital at Carnegie Hall at the age of 13. She was performing at the Providence Biltmore Hotel in Rhode Island when she met Art Todd ‚Äì born Arthur William Todd in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 11, 1914 ‚Äì a guitarist/vocalist also playing at the Biltmore; the pair met as a result of the Biltmore accidentally booking them into the same suite. The couple married in 1941 and ‚Äì after Art Todd's service in the U.S. Army, where he worked in an entertainment unit ‚Äì they settled in Sherman Oaks, California, with a job at the Shadow Mountain Club in Palm Desert, California, inaugurating a career on the California lounge circuit; the Todds also eventually sang on their own radio show. The duo cut records including \\"Heavenly Heavenly\\" for RCA Victor in 1952: the single flopped, but when the song, which served as its B-side,\\"Broken Wings\\" became a hit in the UK Singles Chart for the Stargazers, the Art and Dotty Todd version had a UK release charting at No. 6 (the Stargazers' version reached No. 1, while another version by Dickie Valentine reached No. 12). In 1958, the couple were the resident act at the Chapman Park Hotel in Los Angeles. Art Todd recalled how that year \\"[composer] Wayne Shanklin stopped us one day and said, 'I've got a great song for you.'\\" Art and Dotty cut a demo of \\"Chanson D'Amour\\" which was shopped to Era Records, who released the demo track as a single. According to Art Todd: \\"The airplay was just sensational. This was just at the beginning of rock 'n' roll and the old-time DJs hated rock 'n' roll and they jumped on our song.\\" Their version of \\"Chanson D'Amour\\" reached No. 6 in April 1958 in the US, selling over one million copies, attaining gold disc status. Art and Dotty Todd continued to record for Era and then for Dart Records but were unable to overcome the increasing dominance of rock and roll, remaining one-hit wonders. With \\"Chanson D'Amour\\" making the Melody Maker top 20 in the UK, a remake by the Manhattan Transfer spent three weeks at No. 1 in 1977. The success of \\"Chanson D'Amour\\" allowed Art and Dotty Todd to pursue their nightclub career at a higher-profile level: they regularly played the Dunes in Las Vegas, where they set a consecutive longevity record for playing one room (the Top o' the Strip) for 68 weeks (reported in Billboard magazine August 27, 1966). In 1980 the duo relocated to Honolulu, Hawaii, where they opened their own club. Dotty Todd died in Los Angeles on December 12, 2000, at the age of 87, three months after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

The route, which follows a course that is much older than the grid pattern of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, passes through the neighborhoods of Harlem, Hamilton Heights, and Washington Heights. It is believed to follow the course of an old Indian trail that became an important road in the 17th century between the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam and the British New England Colonies. In the post colonial era, it became the western end of the Boston Post Road. The road became a street when row housing was being built in Harlem during its rapid urban expansion following the end of the American Civil War. St. Nicholas Avenue serves as a border between the West Side of Harlem and Central Harlem. The IND Eighth Avenue Line () runs under St. Nicholas Avenue north of 121st Street as far as 168th Street, and is sometimes referred to as the St. Nicholas Avenue Line. Route North of 169th Street, St. Nicholas Avenue is aligned with the street grid with Wadsworth Avenue one block west (north of 174th Street) and Audubon Avenue one block east. It crosses over the Trans-Manhattan Expressway at 178-179th Streets. The intersection of St. Nicholas with Broadway at 167th Street forms Mitchell Square Park. Below 169th Street, St. Nicholas Avenue cuts at a diagonal to much of the Manhattan street grid, crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 162nd Street and continuing against the grain to West 148th Street. Below 148th, St. Nicholas returns to a rough alignment with the grid, with Convent Avenue one block west and Edgecombe Avenue to the east, down to 124th Street. Below 124th, St. Nicholas Avenue takes a sharp diagonal, crossing Frederick Douglass Boulevard at 121st Street, and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard at 116th Street, ending at Lenox Avenue, just north of Central Park. Its 17th-century origin as part of the Eastern Post Road accounts for its non-conformance to the grid pattern proposed by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. History The street is claimed to follow an old Indian trail called Weekquaeskeek. From early colonial days through the 19th century, it was known as Harlem Lane.Parks Department website Travelers used it for going between New York and northern areas such as Spuyten Duyvil and Kingsbridge.\\"History of St. Nicholas Park\\", Friends of St. Nicholas Park, New York City St. Nicholas Avenue is named after Saint Nicholas of Myra, patron saint of New Amsterdam since Dutch times.\\"St. Nicholas Park\\", New York City Department of Parks and Recreation On September 30, 1956, an American pilot named Thomas Fitzpatrick landed a stolen plane near 191st Street in front of a New York City bar where earlier he had been drinking and made an intoxicated barroom bet that he could travel from New Jersey to New York City in 15 minutes. In 2000, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani signed a bill adding the name \\"Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard\\" to St. Nicholas Avenue for the stretch from Amsterdam Avenue and West 162nd Street to the intersection of West 193rd Street and Fort George Hill. The added name was in honor of Juan Pablo Duarte, one of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic.

Nowadays, the term has fallen out of English and Lowland Scots, but is still used in Gaelic for the month of January specifically. It would appear to be a very old term, as it seems to come from ' or ' meaning a wolf, a creature which has been extinct in Scotland for centuries. The Gael of old regarded stormy weather towards the end of January as prognostic of a fruitful season to follow, or vice versa, as shown in various proverbs. Variations In Lewis, ' fell on the Friday nearest to three weeks before the end of January, and ended on the Tuesday nearest the end of the third week of February. It was said to be three weeks of winter, and three weeks of spring. A shorter ' consisted of the last fortnight of winter, and the first fortnight of spring, in the Old Style calendar, proverbial for its variable weather. Sometimes the first half was called ' (Winter ), and the second half ' (Spring ). ' is also used to mean the equinoxes according to Dwelly, presumably the vernal equinox. Proverbs * \\"In , the three furrows side by side should be full of water, full of snow, and full of house thatch.\\" (presumably referring to climate and growth) * \\"For every mavis that sings in , she‚Äôll lament seven times ere spring be over.\\" * \\"It comes on Friday and goes on Tuesday.\\" John Jamieson records another saying: :\\"they wish the ' in with an adder's head, and to go out with a peacock's tail, i.e. to be stormy in the beginning, and mild towards the end.\\" This is very similar to the Highland sentiments.

It is very similar to an affidavit but is not witnessed and sealed by an official such as a notary public. Instead, the person making the declaration signs a separate endorsement paragraph at the end of the document, stating that the declaration is made under penalty of perjury. In legal proceedings, generally, facts that rely upon an individual's memory or knowledge are most reliably proven by having the person give testimony in court: he appears in person before a judge at a time and place known to other interested persons, swears that his testimony will be true, states his testimony so that all can hear it, and can be cross-examined by opposing parties. Generally, the written record of his testimony is taken down in written form by an official of the court, the court reporter. Such a procedure, although maximizing fairness and the likelihood of obtaining the truth, is expensive, troublesome, and time-consuming. Therefore, in many instances, especially in preliminary or uncontested proceedings, a court allows testimonial evidence to be given in a document filed with the clerk of court. Traditionally, that has required an affidavit: the person must put his testimony into written form and then sign the document in front of an official, such as a notary public or clerk, swearing to the official that the contents of the document are true. The official then endorses the document and generally stamps it with an official seal. Such an affidavit has several advantages over simple signed testimony: * The person giving the testimony is subject to penalties if he has lied, usually the felony of perjury * The official is able to see reason, which gives some assurance that the person is not suffering under a disqualifying disability * The official is able to witness the signing of the document and check the proof of the affiant's identity, helping to prevent some forms of outright fraud. In recent years, however, to provide for even greater economy of time and money, courts have increasingly allowed persons to omit the step of swearing before a notary public or official. Instead, the affiant puts a separate paragraph at the end of the document, such as the following (for United States federal courts): > I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the > foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (for execution within the > United States). For execution outside the United States, see (\\"I declare (or > certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the > United States that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).\\"). Where allowed, such an endorsement gives the document the same weight as an affidavit, per : Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury The document is called a sworn declaration or sworn statement instead of an affidavit, and the maker is called a \\"declarant\\" rather than an \\"affiant\\", but other than this difference in terminology, the two are treated identically by the court. A sworn declaration used in place of an affidavit must be specifically authorized by statute. The federal courts and a few states have general statutes allowing a sworn declaration in any matter where an affidavit can be used.RCW 9A.72.085 - State of Washington In other cases, sworn statements are allowed for some purposes, but not others.For example, Minnesota law allows sworn statements to support a family violence waiver. Minnesota Statutes ¬ß 256J.545 One drawback to the use of a sworn statement while the protection of liability for perjury is retained, the protection is lost of having an independent official witness the signing, check the affiant's identification, etc. That function is essentially taken over by the attorney for the party in whose favor the affidavit is given; the court relies upon the honesty of the attorney, or, perhaps more realistically, upon the attorney's fear of being disbarred, to guarantee that the declarant is competent to testify, is who he says he is, and has actually sworn to the truth of the facts stated. Another incentive for attorneys to make sure that the text of a declaration precisely matches the declarant's recollection is that the witness may be subject to impeachment at trial if discrepancies between the declaration and any later testimony turn out to be significant. Another more practical drawback is the conservative nature of the law. Even if use of a sworn statement is fully authorized, another individual to the transaction, such as a party to a business transaction or another person's attorney, may be unacquainted with the form and refuse to accept it in lieu of a notarized affidavit.

Some documents refer to the Model 1822 as its own separate model, but other documents refer to it as a variant of the Model 1816. Like the Model 1816, the Model 1822 was a .69 caliber smoothbore flintlock, with a 42-inch (107 cm) barrel and an overall length of 58 inches (147 cm). One of the most noticeable differences in the Model 1822 is the attachment of the lower sling swivel. The forward part of the trigger bow was provided with an enlargement which was drilled to receive the sling swivel rivet. Previously, the sling swivel had been affixed to a stud in front of the trigger bow. In addition to the Harper's Ferry and Springfield Armories, the Model 1822 was produced by numerous other contractors. It was eventually replaced by the Springfield Model 1835, which is also considered by many to be a continuation of the Model 1816. Like other flintlocks, many of the Model 1822 were converted to percussion lock systems in the 1840s and 1850s, as percussion caps were more reliable and weather resistant than flintlocks. Some also had their barrels rifled so that they could fire the newly developed Mini√© ball. However, during the City Mexico City Campaign, General Winfield Scott insisted on his army being equipped with flintlock muskets because flints were easy to make or procure, important in a hostile country where supply lines were vulnerable. The Model 1822 was used in both the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. During the latter, .69 caliber muskets (mostly percussion, but some flintlocks as well) were common in the early part of the war (either in their original form or converted to rifling). They had totally disappeared from the Army of the Potomac by the second half of 1862 (aside from the Irish Brigade, which carried Model 1842 muskets until 1864), but the less-well equipped Confederates used them for longer, and the Army of Northern Virginia's ordnance chief claimed that Gettysburg was the first battle in which the army was completely free of smoothbore muskets. In the West, the situation was worse for both sides and smoothbores remained in use in the Union armies into 1863. Some Confederate regiments were still carrying .69 caliber muskets at the Battle of Franklin in November 1864.

This term was sometimes anglicised as graddan, graddin or greddin, or Graydon meal for the resulting product. It was corn or meal prepared after the ancient custom of the Gael. A woman sitting down, took a handful of corn and holding it in her left hand by the stalks, she set fire to the ears, which were at once in a flame. In her right hand she held a stick, which she very dexterously beat the grain out the very instant the husks were quite burnt. By this simple process, corn may be cut down, winnowed, ground, dried, and baked within half an hour. In separating the meal from the husks, instead of stoves, they made use of a sheepskin, stretched on a hoop, minutely perforated by a small hot iron. The bread which is made is considered very salubrious, and was extremely pleasant to the palate of the Gael. Another method, almost the same, used in Uist was when the grain end of the sheaf was put into the flame of the fire, and when the chaff and ends of the straw were well alight, the sheaf is held over a clean-swept part of the hearth, or over some vessel, when the grain drops off.

The fear of being left with the last sheaf of the harvest called the cailleach (kulyach etc.) or gobhar bhacach (the goat of the balk) always led to an exciting competition among the reapers in the last field. The reaper who came on a leum-iochd would of course be glad to have so much less to cut. An old saying was \\"better a balk in autumn, than a sheaf the more.\\" Rev. Michie of Dinnet heard the above saying in a different sense in the Highlands of Aberdeenshire, viz. that in lands allotted on the run-rig system, the crofter who got a balk attached to his rig was considered luckier than his neighbour with a somewhat larger rig, because, but without the balk, the grass of which was of more than compensating value, especially for fodder etc. In Heart of Midlothian (1818) by Walter Scott, he glosses it as \\"an unploughed ridge of land interposed among the corn\\" Gregor's Folk-lore of North East Scotland (1881) says: :\\"Even in the cultivated parts of larger size there was no regularity. They were twisted, bent like a bow, zig-zag, of all shapes, and cut up by 'baaks', into which were gathered stones and such weeds as were taken from the portion under crop.\\" Bauks were also used as boundaries between neighbours' land. George Robertson's General view of Agriculture in Perth (1799) says: > \\"Large slices of land are left unploughed, as boundaries between the > alternate ridges of neighbours, in the same plough-gate; which are a > perpetual nursery of weeds, besides the loss of so much land lying waste. > These earthern boundaries ... are wearing fast out, in this country.\\" This indicates that they were well in decline in parts of Lowland Scotland in the late 18th century. However, the word is recorded in the 1920s north east Scotland, as referring to a path between fields, obviously a residual use with a slightly different meaning.

There is some overlap with the process of making cloth, in that both involve textiles immersed in water.

Signed by Robert Smith, John Hart, and John Stevens, Jr.. The pound was the money of account of New Jersey until 1793. Initially, the British pound and some foreign currencies circulated, supplemented from 1709 by local paper money. However, although the notes were denominated in pounds, shillings and pence, they did not have the same value as the British pound sterling or of other colonial currencies with denominations in pounds. A proclamation of Queen Anne, issued in 1704 and legislated by parliament in 1707, standardized the value of all colonial currencies at 6 colonial schillings to a full weight Spanish Milled Dollar, which was in turn equivalent to 4 shillings 6 pence sterling. This made a colonial schilling equivalent to nine pence sterling and a colonial pound equivalent to 2 troy oz 18 dwt 8 gr (1,400 grains / 90.7 grams) of silver. Currency issued at this rate was referred to as ‚ÄúProclamation Money‚Äù. The Comparative Value of Money between Britain and the Colonies, https://coins.nd.edu/colcurrency/currencyintros/introvalue.html The currency of colonial New Jersey consisted of bills of credit which circulated as legal tender. Each issue was inscribed with the weight of silver it was current for. The initial 1709 issue passed at the rate of 2¬Ω ounces of silver per New Jersey Pound, but issues after 1724 had inscriptions with specified the Proclamation Money rate. Although that made a Spanish Milled Dollar officially worth 6 New Jersey shillings, accounts from the 1750s indicate that Spanish Milled Dollars passed for 8 shillings in New York and adjacent parts of East New Jersey and for 7 shillings 6 pence in Pennsylvania and West New Jersey. This practice, and hence the value of New Jersey currency, remained stable up to the revolution and the reasons for its stability have been widely studied. Redemption theories attribute its stability to the fact that (a) each issue of currency had a fixed redemption date and (b) the colonial assembly consistently redeemed its currency at face value with taxes which were clearly feasible to collect A New Approach to Solving the Colonial Monetary Puzzle: Evidence from New Jersey, 1709-1775, Francis Grubb. For issues of currency which New Jersey used to finance Queen Anne's War and the French and Indian War, taxes in equal amounts were voted on and approved with the issue of currency. Thus, the paper money provided ‚Äúcurrency finance‚Äù for the war effort in anticipation of future tax income. In practice, theses issues were retired by citizens who used them to pay taxes. New Jersey made additional issues of currency to make loans to citizens for the purchase of land, which served as collateral for the loans and hence as backing for the bills. Here, the currency was retired by debtors using it to repay the loans. A competing theory attributes the stability of New Jersey‚Äôs currency to its circulation alongside precious metal coins or their equivalents. The agreement of merchants to accept it at the rate of 7 schillings 6 pence for a Spanish Milled Dollar gave it ‚Äúde facto convertibility‚Äù and hence stability The Case of Colonial New Jersey‚Äôs Paper Money: The Redemption Theory's Resurrection or Its Death Rattle, Ron Mishener. The State of New Jersey issued Continental currency denominated in ¬£sd and Spanish dollars, with $1 = 7/6. Copper coins were also issued in the mid-1780s, bearing the Latin name of the state, Nova C√¶sarea. The continental currency was later replaced by the U.S. dollar at the rate of $1,000 continental = US$1.

Typically, rocking stones are residual corestones formed initially by spheroidal weathering and have later been exposed by erosion or glacial erratics left by retreating glaciers.Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P.

A few rocking stones might be man-made megaliths. Name The word \\"logan\\" is probably derived from the word \\"log\\", which in an English dialect means to rock. In fact, in some parts of the UK, rocking stones or logan stones are called logging stones. The word \\"log\\" might be connected with the Danish word logre, which means to \\"wag a tail\\". Some have suggested that the word \\"logan\\" comes from a Cornish expression for the movement that someone makes when inebriated. Davies Gilbert writes: :It may be observed that I have always used the words Loging Rock for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas. Much learned research seems to have been idly expended on the supposed name, \\"Logan Rock.\\" To log is a verb in general use throughout Cornwall for vibrating or rolling like a drunken man, and is frequently heard in provincial pronunciation for tug, characteristic of the modem present participle. The Loging Rock is, therefore, strictly descriptive of its peculiar motion. Rocking Stone Viklan, Jelen√≠ str√°≈à, Jizera Mountains  Examples of rocking stones  Such stones are common in Britain and other places around the world. For example, in Galicia, rocking stones are called pedras de abalar.A ¬¥Pedra de Abalar¬¥. Consulted on 20 June 2014. Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79) wrote about a rock near Harpasa (in Caria, Asia Minor) \\"that can be moved with one finger, but that also resists a push made with the whole body.\\"Pliny: Natural History, Book II: XCVII Ptolemy (circa 90‚Äì168) wrote about the Gygonian rock, which he wrote \\"can only be moved with an asphodel and remains immovable by force.\\"Photius' Bibliotheca #190: Ptolemy Chennus, New History There are stones in Iona called na clachan-br√†th, within the precincts of a burial ground, and placed on the pedestal of a cross, and have been according to Pennant, the supports of a tomb. The Witch's Rocking Stone or Boarstone on the Craig o'Kyle in East Ayrshire A massive 90 to 95 ton glacial erratic boulder near Halifax, Nova Scotia, can still be rocked with a lever, but used to move quite easily, before a band of sailors from the nearby Halifax garrison rocked it into a more stable configuration in the 1890s, and before its base was worn down by excessive rocking in the 1980s and '90s when a park was developed around it at Kidston Lake, in the Spryfield area of the municipality. It used to be a popular picnic destination; in Victorian times, people would travel from Halifax, climb upon it and spread their lunches, while enjoying the sensation of rocking gently while seated upon the huge rock.

It apparently was discovered by an employee of the lord of the local manor whose duty it was to watch the coast. A ship had been wrecked in the cove, and while watching ensuing activity, the employee leaned against a boulder. Suddenly, a gust of wind occurred, and the boulder shifted, or \\"logged\\". The longest side of this mass of stone is about , and the circumference of its biggest end is about . It is thought to weigh about 20 tons. The Coylton or Witch's rocking stone in 1863 A rocking stone is recorded near the site of Saint Bride's Chapel. The Witch's or Boarstone stands on top of the Craigs of Kyle near Coylton in Ayrshire. It weighs around 30 tons and rests upon two or three stones. A large standing stone known as Wallace's stone is recorded to have stood nearby.Paterson, James (1863).

The Lamargle or Lugar Rocking Stone near the Bellow Water Near Lugar in the Parish of Auchinleck in Ayrshire, Scotland, is the Lamargle or Lamargee rocking stone in a hollow by the Bello or Bellow Water near its junction with the Glenmore Water from which point the name Lugar Water is applied. It is made of two vertical stones, and a horizontal stone about 6 ft long, 3 ft broad, and 4 ft high. It was regarded as a Druidic monument or the grave of a Caledonian hero.Currie, Robert. Rocking stone near Lugar. Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers Society. Annals. 1904‚Äì1907. P. 23. This stone has often been overlooked, as the OS maps give the wrong location; it sits beside the Bellow Water above its confluence with the Glenmore Water and not on Lamargle Hill. The Kyaiktiyo Pagoda in Burma is a religious shrine built on top of a huge granite boulder that is also a rocking stone. Some masses shaped by humans also exhibit similar behaviour (sometimes unintentionally). For example, in the ruins of the Roman temples at Jerash in Jordan (the \\"city of 1000 pillars\\"), some massive pillars move back and forth in the slightest breeze.A travel diary from Jordan describing the movement of pillars at Jerash Stones that used to move A stone used to rock on a gritstone outcrop on Warley Moor near Halifax in West Yorkshire. It had already ceased to rock when described by John Watson in 1775. The Rocking Stone at Cuff Hill in Ayrshire Ayrshire in Southwest Scotland apparently is endowed with a geology that lends itself towards the formation of rocking stones. Several rocking stones, or stones that used to rock at one time, are there. A rocking stone that some associate with the Druids is on Cuff Hill in Hessilhead, near Beith in North Ayrshire. It no longer rocks due to people digging beneath to ascertain its fulcrum.Topographical Description of Ayrshire; more Particularly of Cunninghame: together with a Genealogical account of the Principal families in that Bailiwick., George Robertson, Cunninghame Press, Irvine, 1820 It is in a small wood and surrounded by a circular drystone wall. An article was published in the Cumnock Chronicle in 1907 on the reason for the stone being dislodged. The Ogrestone or Thurgartstone near Dunlop in East Ayrshire is thought to have been a rocking stone. However, soil has built up around the base of the Thurgatstone over the years, which now prevents any rocking motion. A rocking stone existed in 1913‚Äì1919 at Sannox on Arran, on a nearly horizontal platform next to the seashore.Allen, Charles A. Arran: Its Charm & Beauty. Kilmarncok Glenfield Ramblers Society. Annals. 1904 ‚Äì 1907. facing P. 76. The Lamagee or Lamargle stone in Lugar as previously mentioned is in the center of a loose collection of stones in the village of Lugar in East Ayrshire. The Lamargle stone rests on two stones. Local legend has it that the Lamargle stone used to rock, but it no longer does. The Witch's Stone or Boarstone on the Craigs o'Kyle is recorded by the author John Smith as having rocked. The Clochoderick Rocking Stone Clochoderick Rocking Stone The Clochoderick Stone near Howwood and Kilbarchan in Renfrewshire used to rock, and it is said that the Druids used it to judge people. The accused was made to sit on the stone and by the way it moved, the Druids judged the innocence or guilt of the individual. It is also said to be the burial place of Rhydderch Hael, King of Strathclyde, who was the victor at the Battle of Arderydd near Arthuret in the Borders. His victory brought Christianity to Strathclyde. This stone is very unusual and is a SSSI for Geology in its own right. Dislodged rocking stones Often wear, erosion, or human intervention has resulted in the dislodging of rocking stones. Devon A well-known rocking stone or logan stone was located at Sharpitor near Lustleigh on Dartmoor. It was also called the Nutcrackers Stone, sometimes seen on Ordnance Survey maps. The huge stone once lay overhanging Lustleigh Cleave until 1951, when vandals pushed the stone down the valley. A failed attempt to rescue the stone by pulling it back up the valley resulted in it breaking into pieces.Weir John and Le Messurier 1988, Great Walks: Dartmoor & Exmoor Around 1900 there were rocking stones at Rippon tor, and Sittaford tor on Dartmoor.Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia Vol X, 1922. p6659 Rocking Stone Larchmont, New York A 150-ton glacial erratic occurs on Rockingstone Avenue in Larchmont, New York, that was so perfectly balanced that just a small touch would allow it to rock back and forth. Unfortunately in the 1920s, blasting for a new sewer system in the neighbourhood dislodged the rock, so it no longer balances. Pembrokeshire A rocking stone in Pembrokeshire is described in Gibson‚Äôs edition of Camden's Britannia, from a manuscript account by George Owen: :\\"This shaking stone may be seen on a sea-cliff within half a mile of St. David's. It is so vast that I presume it may exceed the draught of an hundred oxen, and it is altogether rude and unpolished. The occasion of the name (Y maen sigl, or the Rocking-stone) is for that being mounted upon divers other stones about a yard in height it is so equally poised that a man may shake it with one finger so that five or six men sitting on it shall perceive themselves moved thereby.\\" Cromwell‚Äôs soldiers rendered the rocking stone of Pembrokeshire immovable after Mr. Owen had described it. They reportedly destroyed it because they felt it encouraged superstition. Golcar Hill Another rocking stone was at Golcar Hill, near Halifax in Yorkshire. However, the Golcar Hill rocking stone will no longer easily rock because some masons wanted to find out how such a large weight could move so easily, so they chopped at it until they destroyed its balance. Men Amber A very sensitive rocking stone called Men Amber (sometimes written as Men-Amber or Menamber) was on a high ridge in the parish of Sithney, near Pendennis, Cornwall. It is long, deep, and wide. It was toppled by Shrubsall, the governor of Pendennis, and his men about 1650 during Cromwell‚Äôs Commonwealth. One rumoured motivation for the dislodging was a purported prophecy of Merlin, who supposedly said that Men Amber would stand until England had no king. Rev. Dr. William Stukeley wrote: :Main Ambres; petrae ambrosiae, signify the stones anointed with holy oil, consecrated; or in a general sense, a temple, altar or places or worship William Borlase in his 1754 book Antiquities of Cornwall, claimed that Men Amber was dislodged because: :the vulgar used to resort to this place at particular times of the year, and paid to this rock more respect than was thought becoming to good Christians. Logan Rock The Logan Rock at Trereen Dinas Another well-known example of a rocking or logan stone is Logan Rock of Treen in Cornwall. This huge stone weighs about 80 or 90 tons. It is one of the best-known rocking stones for several reasons. For example, Modred, in William Mason's dramatic poem \\"Caractacus\\" addressing the characters Vellinus and Elidurus, says of the Logan Rock: :::Thither, youths, :::Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge :::And unhewn sphere of living adamant, :::Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight :::On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems, :::Such is the strange and virtuous property, :::It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch :::Of him whose breast is pure; but to a traitor, :::Tho‚Äô ev‚Äôn a giant‚Äôs prowess nerv‚Äôd his arm, :::It stands as fixt as Snowdon. However, another reason that the Logan Rock of Treen is remembered is that it was the center of a famous drama. In April 1824, Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith, R. N. (nephew of the famous poet Oliver Goldsmith), and 10 or 12 of his crew of the cutter HMS Nimble, armed with bars and levers, rocked the huge granite boulder until it fell from its cliff-top perch. Goldsmith was apparently motivated to disprove the claim of Dr. Borlase, who wrote in Antiquities of Cornwall in 1754 that: :In the parish of S. Levan, there is a promontory called Castle Treryn. This cape consists of three distinct groups of rocks. On the western side of the middle group near the top, lies a very large stone, so evenly, poised that any hand may move it to and fro; but the extremities of its base are at such a distance from each other, and so well secured by their nearness to the stone which it stretches itself upon, that it is morally impossible that any lever, or indeed force, however applied in a mechanical way, can remove it from its present situation. The Logan Rock (circled) seen from Pednvounder beach Goldsmith was determined to demonstrate that nothing was impossible when the courage and skill of British seamen were engaged. The Logan Rock fell and was caught in a narrow chasm. This upset the local residents considerably, since Logan Rock had been used to draw tourists to the area. Sir Richard Vyvyan (1800‚Äì1879)101 Cornish Lives, Maurice Smelt, was particularly unhappy. They demanded that the British Admiralty strip Lieutenant Goldsmith of his Royal Navy commission unless he restored the boulder to its previous position at his own expense. However, Mr. Davies Gilbert persuaded the Lords of the Admiralty to lend Lieutenant Goldsmith the required apparatus for replacing the Logan Rock. The Admiralty sent 13 captains with blocks and chains from the dock yard at Plymouth, and contributed ¬£25 towards expenses. Gilbert also raised more funds. The Logan Rock (top right) in context After months of effort, at 4:20 pm on 2 November 1824, in front of thousands of spectators and with the help of more than 60 men and block and tackle, the Logan Rock was finally repositioned and returned to \\"rocking condition\\".Michell, John (1974). The Old Stones of Land's End. Garnstone Press. . P. 78. Apparently, the total final cost of this enterprise was ¬£130 8s 6d. However, it is not clear how much of the remaining ¬£105 Goldsmith had to make up out of his own pocket. For some time after, the rock was kept chained and padlocked, but eventually these restrictions were removed, and the rock was set free. However, it apparently no longer vibrates or \\"logs\\" as easily as it did before. Tourism dropped, and this was blamed on the condition of Logan Rock. For a while, Treen was nicknamed 'Goldsmith's Deserted Village'. Another famous rock structure, Lanyon Cromlech, was knocked down during a thunderstorm in 1815. The same machinery that was used to restore the Logan Rock in Treen was successful in repositioning Lanyon Cromlech. Beliefs Rocking Stone 'Maen Sigl' Great Orme Llandudno A wide variety of beliefs are associated with rocking stones. Because of their strange nature, rocking stones were sometimes associated with witchcraft, or Druids. The rocking stone near Nancledrea in Cornwall was said to only move at midnight when witches were out. People claimed that if one touched the rocking stone nine times at midnight, one would turn into a witch. The Brimham rocking stone in Yorkshire is said to rock only for the efforts of an honest man.Hippisley Coxe, Antony D. (1973). Haunted Britain. Pub. Hutchinson. . P. 21. The rocking stone at Land's End was said to have been placed there by a giant who used it to rock himself to sleep. It was claimed that the Logan Stone in Treen could cure childhood diseases. The children were rocked on the Logan Stone in certain seasons. People say that the charm was broken when Lieutenant Goldsmith dislodged the Logan Stone. It is a Cornish tradition to make a vow and then attempt to move a rocking stone, or logan rock. It was said that no persons with treachery in their hearts could make a rocking stone move.

It is said that once a young boy can lift the stone to his waist he was considered a man. Furthermore, the stone was used to develop a man's strength in preparation for battle. There was no set size, shape or weight for each stone. Stones varied, depending on what was available within the locality or by what was selected by the king of each region. The king's Teulu (\\"personal army\\") were selected from each village or town within his borders, based upon a man's ability to lift stones, run, jump, leap, wrestle, fence, shoot a bow and arrow and throw a spear. To date, a lifting stone \\"Y Garreg Orchest\\" is still in place in the town of Criccieth in Gwynedd, North Wales. Competitors travel from all across the UK to attempt to lift this mammoth stone. In 2015 there was one successful lift of the 28 stone Goliath. Basque Country Stone lifting is also a traditional Basque Country sport involving the lifting of stones, called harri jasotzea. There are several varieties, particularly using round stones and rectangular ones. The goal can be raising and dropping a stone of certain weight as many times as possible or simply raising a heavy stone once in order to beat an existing record. Carrying variants The \\"stone carry\\" or \\"stone walk\\" is a traditional Scottish and Icelandic athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition. This type of event has become very popular in the sport of Strongman, with many variations being used in numerous competitions all over the world. The rules are simple: the competitors each pick up a pair of very heavy stones equipped with iron handles, and carry the paired stones as far down the field as they can. The length of the field varies depending on the site, but a hundred feet is typical. This event is also known as the farmer's walk. If two or more competitors carry the stones the entire length of the field, heavier stones are then used. At the New Hampshire Highland Games, the record carry () is a pair of stones weighing 508 pounds (230 kg) carried just under 100 feet (30 m). The game probably originated as an outgrowth of the need to clear stones from agricultural fields to create clearance cairns. A similar Basque sport is the ontzi eramatea, where the weights were originally milk canisters.

The claims in the video are controversial; some have been discredited, while others continue to be debated. The philandering and sexual harassment claims in the film have since been reported, and in some cases confirmed, by mainstream media. Years after the movie was released Clinton paid an out-of- court settlement to resolve the accusations made by Paula Jones in the movie. While the film was directed by Patrick Matrisciana, who has a production company called Jeremiah Films, the production was credited to Citizens for Honest Government, a project of a Westminster, California organization named Creative Ministries Inc. that has connections to Matrisciana. It was partially funded by Larry Nichols, a long-time Clinton opponent, and distributed with help from the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who also appears in the film. Over 300,000 copies of the film were put into circulation with perhaps half that being sales. Summary The film was produced shortly after Clinton's election to the presidency and provides background on a number of conspiracy theories associated with now former president Bill Clinton. Several of these theories date to Clinton's tenure as the governor of Arkansas. Allegations include: *Being a drug addict *Having affairs with or harassing numerous women *Troopergate- using Arkansas State Police officers to facilitate sexual liaisons and intimidate accusers *Misuse of funds with the Arkansas Development Finance Authority *Using Bank of Credit and Commerce International to launder money *Profiting from drug smuggling at the Mena Airport **Protecting Barry Seal's drug smuggling activities **Murdering witnesses to the Mena drug smuggling operation **Covering up the circumstances surrounding the deaths of two boys found dead on railroad tracks near the airport, Kevin Ives and Don Henry **Protecting a state medical examiner who was repeatedly accused of misstating the cause of death in several autopsies *Whitewater controversy *Covering up the cause of the death of Vince Foster *Using contacts at the Rose Law Firm to shred documents that would have implicated Clinton in scandals Criticism The video was characterized by The Washington Post as a \\"bizarre and unsubstantiated documentary.\\" The New York Times reported that it was a poorly documented \\"hodgepodge of sometimes-crazed charges.\\" The producers were criticized after it came to light that a number of the people in the documentary had been paid to appear. The director admitted the payments but denied he had instructed any paid participants to say anything that was false. The movie helped perpetuate a conspiracy theory known as the \\"Clinton Body Count\\" about a list of associates Clinton was purported to have had killed. The Los Angeles Times reported that Larry Nichols, who appears throughout the film and is the primary source for a number of the murder and mysterious death claims, was fired from his Arkansas state government job and once admitted to an Associated Press reporter to being motivated by spite. The fact checking site TruthOrFiction.com states that \\"There is no credible evidence that any of the deaths is related or can be attributed to Bill Clinton\\". To promote the film, Falwell aired an interview with Matrisciana, who was silhouetted to conceal his identity as he pretended to be a journalist who was afraid for his life. Matrisciana later acknowledged that he was not in any danger, but that the interview was staged for dramatic effect at Falwell's suggestion. Later developments The New York Times interviewed some of the participants in the film after it aired for followup developments. Gary Parks, who appeared in a segment of the film discussing the suspicious circumstances of the death of his father while investigating Clinton's womanizing, admitted he embellished some details in the film, but still believes his father was killed for political reasons. Linda Ives, the mother of Kevin Ives, stated that her interest for participating was solving the mystery of her son's death, and was concerned her comments were used for political purposes. Bill Duncan, a former IRS agent who investigated the Mena accusations regretted appearing on the film, stating, \\"I would not have willingly been a part of it had I known where that footage would end up\\". Matrisciana produced a followup video focused exclusively on the Mena airport drug smuggling and murder accusations. Two police officers accused in that film of being involved with the murders of Ives and Henry attempted to sue Matrisciana for defamation. They initially prevailed; however, lost the case when it was appealed. The appeal focused primarily on free speech and the ability to criticize public figures. Even though the judges overturned the ruling of defamation, they were critical of the film in their ruling, saying it blurred the lines between fact and fiction. A number of the incidents mentioned in The Clinton Chronicles continued to be investigated after its release. Paula Jones, who appeared in the film accusing Clinton of harassing her, sued the president for sexual harassment. The president paid Jones $850,000 to settle the case out of court. Special prosecutor Ken Starr was assigned to investigate a number of incidents mentioned in the film. While the Starr Report accused Clinton of obstruction of justice in covering up an affair, and other players in the Whitewater controversy were charged and sentenced, Starr declined to recommend charges for Clinton over Whitewater and cleared Clinton of involvement with Vince Foster's death. Linda Ives continues to search for justice for her son's death. The film mentioned that her son's death was controversially ruled accidental by an examiner who had a history of questionable rulings. After the film aired, she had her son's body exhumed and a second autopsy performed. She successfully had the original examiner's ruling overruled and the cause of death for Kevin Ives and Don Henry was changed from accidental to homicide. In February 2018, Billy Jack Haynes, a professional wrestler with a history of making controversial claims on camera, claimed to have been hired as a body guard for drug smugglers and a witness to these murders. He advocated for the case to be re-opened; however, the case remains unsolved. See also ;People who appeared or who were discussed in the film *James D.

On June 24, 2003, the town was completely annihilated by a large F4-rated tornado, and has since become a ghost town. In 2004, the state of South Dakota officially disincorporated the town of Manchester. History Manchester was originally called Fairview; the present name honors a certain pioneer settler named Manchester. With the influence of the railroad, Manchester underwent rapid expansion, including the building of \\"numerous homes, a town hall, grocery stores, livery barns, a lumber yard, two grain elevators, a depot, a restaurant, a cream station, a bank, a pool hall, auto repair, blacksmith shops, gas stations, two churches, a system of township schools including Manchester High School, a hotel, a newspaper and a fabled town pump\\".http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1X4P_Manchester_South_Dakota Grace Ingalls Dow, sister of Little House on the Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder, spent a significant part of her adult life in Manchester. She worked as a teacher in the local school and died in 1941. Her sister Mary Ingalls lived with her for a while as well. Laura Ingalls Wilder spent many years (and set several of her Little House books) in De Smet, a similarly sized town seven miles to Manchester's east along the railroad line. Into the 20th century, the diminishing importance of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad line through Manchester slowed train traffic and cut into the town's expansion, causing many to leave the town. This slide continued into the Great Depression as the line lay idle and more residents were forced to close their businesses and move elsewhere to find work. Despite road contact finally being made through Manchester in the late 1930s, little remained to induce people to linger and the few remaining residents began to die off or move away, with many relocating to nearby De Smet or Huron. Having lost many of its residents and its primary means of attracting more, Manchester's population steadily dwindled until a core population of no more than 100 residents remained, with most operating farms and ranches outside the town limits. The CNW railroad officially announced its intended permanent abandonment of the railroad line in 1986, but later sold the tracks to the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad. By 2003, less than a dozen structures (including two operating businesses) remained standing on the original Manchester town plot along US-14 and 425th Avenue.  Destruction by F4 Tornado  Damage path across Manchester. The tornado approached from the bottom of the photo and tracked north across US-14 and through the town. On June 24, 2003 a classic supercell thunderstorm spawned a tornado over eastern South Dakota. The tornado gradually matured and widened, forming a large \\"wedge\\" shape, and achieving an intensity of F4 on the Fujita scale and a width of between one-half and one mile as it entered Manchester. The mesocyclone associated with the tornado was tracked by a large number of meteorologists and storm chasers. A small probe was placed directly in the tornado's damage path. The vortex traveled directly over the instrument, and record-breaking meteorological data was obtained by the probe. It managed to survive winds at the time estimated to be up to 260 mph (418 km/h)NOAA National Weather Service, Sioux Falls, SD \\"Record Pressure Drop Recorded with Manchester Tornado\\", Retrieved on 2009-10-13. and measured a barometric pressure fall of around 100 millibars near the center of the half-mile wide tornado. Current estimates of wind speeds in an EF4-rated tornado would be in the 166-200 mph (267‚Äì322 km/h) range. Manchester was an extremely small and compact town, with the central township abutting the intersection of US Highway 14 and 425th Avenue in rural Kingsbury County and surrounded on all sides by miles of farmland. The tornado struck the town from the south while doing strong F3/weak F4 damage, and was easily powerful enough to destroy the handful of elderly structures remaining in the town center (including the town post office), as well as several outlying buildings along US-14. According to Dan Kight of the Kingsbury County Sheriff's department: \\"There's a business that's partially left, but everything else is gone,\\" noting only three or four families lived in Manchester. Also according to Kight, some residents were transported to the hospital with injuries. Storm chaser Tim Samaras placed several \\"turtle probes\\" ahead of the tornado's path and one of them scored a direct hit. It recorded a pressure drop of 100 millibars in the span of five seconds, the deepest and fastest pressure drop ever recorded directly by any instrument in a weather event. The gravel was scoured from the road that the probe was placed in by the tornadic winds but when the probe was lifted there was still gravel underneath it.http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=tor2003jun24_samaras Final status 1991 photo showing Manchester before... ...and after (2004). The tractor shed to the southeast was added after the town's abandonment. As of 2020, the Manchester town site lies barren and abandoned. All that remains of Manchester is the slab foundations of demolished houses along the dirt road grid that composed the town center and the famous Manchester town pump (which survived a direct hit from the tornado mostly intact). The lush trees which were planted in the 19th century to shelter the town's homes and residents from the summer heat were all razed by the tornado, returning the area to a sea of empty farmland. There are no plans to rebuild, and the destruction of the town's post office and all remaining structures (along with the flight of the few remaining residents) served to finally extinguish Manchester's raison d'√™tre, making it a natural disaster-induced ghost town. Although the town itself is empty and depopulated, many former official residents of Manchester continue to reside in the unincorporated farm areas between De Smet and Iroquois, South Dakota, and many others have relocated to other small communities nearby. On June 25, 2007 a granite monument was erected in the ghost town commemorating its history and honoring the residents who had lived there.

Plain circles on the wall represent plague deaths. The Bombay plague epidemic was a bubonic plague epidemic that struck the city of Bombay (present-day Mumbai) in the late nineteenth century. The plague killed thousands, and many fled the city leading to a drastic fall in the population of the city.  Causes  The rapid growth of Bombay's commerce led to a large influx of workers. In the 1891 census the population of Bombay was counted to be 820,000. Most of the immigrant workers (over 70%) lived in chawls. The city services were not geared towards the well-being of the working class and various diseases were endemic to the slums. Detection In September 1896 the first case of bubonic plague was detected in Mandvi by Dr.Acacio Gabriel Viegas. It spread rapidly to other parts of the city, and the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week through the rest of the year. Many people fled from Bombay at this time, and in the census of 1901, the population had actually fallen to 780,000. Viegas correctly diagnosed the disease as bubonic plague and tended to patients at great personal risk. He then launched a vociferous campaign to clean up slums and exterminate rats, the carriers of the fleas which spread the plague bacterium. To confirm Viegas' findings, four teams of independent experts were brought in. With his diagnosis proving to be correct, the Governor of Bombay invited W M Haffkine, who had earlier formulated a vaccine for cholera, to do the same for the epidemic. In the first year of the plague, a research laboratory was set up at the JJ Hospital. It moved in 1899 to the Government House in Parel under the directorship of Haffkine. This was the beginning of the Haffkine Institute. Those who could afford it tried to avoid the plague by moving out of the city. Jamsetji Tata tried to open up the northern suburbs to accommodate such people. The brunt of the plague was borne by mill workers. The anti-plague activities of the health department involved police searches, isolation of the sick, detention in camps of travellers and forced evacuation of residents in parts of the city. These measures were widely regarded as offensive and alarming. The extent of this outrage was demonstrated with the murder of W.C. Rand, British chairman of the Special Plague Committee. He was murdered by the Chapekar brothers, two Indian revolutionaries angered by the intrusive methods employed by the British to combat the plague in Pune. In 1900, the mortality rate from plague was about 22 per thousand. In the same year, the corresponding rates from tuberculosis were 12 per thousand, from cholera about 14 per thousand, and about 22 per thousand from various other illnesses classified as \\"fevers\\". The plague was fearsome only because it was apparently contagious. More mundane diseases took a larger toll. On 9 December 1898 the Bombay City Improvement Trust was created by an act of the British Parliament. It was entrusted with the job of creating a healthier city. One of the measures taken by the CIT was the building of roads, like Princess Street and Sydenham Road (now Mohammedali Road), which would channel the sea air into the more crowded parts of the town.

Unlike the 50 species from those four tribes, however, this species is unique in that it is the only scombrid to be classified apart from the rest, into the subfamily Gasterochismatinae and genus Gasterochisma. Although taxonomists and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations have accepted the name \\"butterfly kingfish\\", this fish has had many common names, including big- scaled mackerel, bigscale mackerel, butterfly mackerel, butterfly tuna, scaled tunny, scaly tuna, and others. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave approval for this fish to be marketed simply as \\"mackerel\\". Description The juveniles of the butterfly kingfish are characterized by enormous pelvic fins that are longer than the length of its head, and that become more proportional as the fish grows. At any size, the pelvic fin tucks into a deep ventral groove, in much the same way as the first dorsal spines do in all scombrids. This species has very large cycloid scales, below which is a thick layer of fat. The swim bladder has two anterior projections that extend into the back of the skull, near the inner ear. This fish lacks the median keel on the caudal peduncle ‚Äì it only has the characteristic pair of small keels on each side of the base of the caudal fin, as do other scombrids. It has 21 precaudal vertebrae, plus 23 caudal vertebrae. Drawing of a butterfly kingfish This fish can be found around the world in southern temperate waters of , but most commonly under , and at depths to in the open ocean. It grows to a length of . Most bony fishes are ectothermic, or cold-blooded, but this species, much like the related tunas, is endothermic and is able to raise its body temperature to achieve a degree of thermoregulation. It has a brain heater organ derived from the lateral rectus eye muscle, which is distinct from that of the billfishes, whose heater is derived from their superior rectus muscles. Etymology Gasterochisma derives from the , and (') \\"crossing; X-shaped; sign of the 'X'\\". Taxonomy The evolutionary lineage of the butterfly kingfish is more primitive and quite different from that of the rest of the scombrids. Additionally, the morphology of this species is substantially different from that of the others ‚Äì some suggest that it might belong in a different family altogether. At present, however, morphology and nuclear phylogeny provide support that Gasterochisma is the basal scombrid, and that both its genus, Gasterochisma, and its subfamily, Gasterochismatinae, remain as monotypic taxa under the family Scombridae. The following cladogram shows the most likely evolutionary relationships between the butterfly kingfish and the tunas, mackerels, Spanish mackerels, and bonitos.

A few years later, the family moved to Fresno, California, where Frontiere performed at dinner theatres alongside her mother in a duo, the Pamela Sisters. During this time, she married her second husband, who was killed in a car accident near San Francisco shortly after the couple had wed. Early career In the early 1950s, Frontiere worked as a urologist's secretary while acting in Fresno's Garrick Little Theatre (where she met her third husband). The couple divorced a short time later.

They were married for a short time. Later, she made appearances as part of NBC's \\"Today\\" show cast. She also performed as a nightclub singer in Miami. While living in Miami, Frontiere was introduced to the then Baltimore Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom (who was separated from his first wife) at a party hosted by Joseph Kennedy at his Palm Beach estate in 1957. Kennedy was a fan of Georgia after seeing her on her morning show. Rosenbloom and Georgia were engaged in 1960, but it took Rosenbloom ten years to divorce his first wife (in a widely reported divorce negotiation). Rosenbloom and Frontiere married in 1966, though they had been together for eight years and had two children by this point. In 1972, Rosenbloom traded ownership of the Baltimore Colts for ownership of the Los Angeles Rams. During this time, the couple resided in Bel Air, California, and Frontiere became a part of the Los Angeles social scene, hosting numerous parties and philanthropic events. Frontiere was also known to entertain guests in a section near the owner's box at the Los Angeles Coliseum dubbed Georgia's Grandstand.

However, Frontiere couldn't navigate the conflicts between General Manager Don Klosterman and Rosenbloom and fired Rosenbloom after four months.

By the mid-1980s, Frontiere had passed much of the Rams' daily financial and football management responsibilities on to key executives.

In 1980, the team moved out of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (a severely outdated facility that was too big to sell out for most games and resulted in frequent blackouts) and into the California Angels' Anaheim Stadium. In the early 1990s, the Rams franchise suffered from poor attendance. Average attendance had fallen to 45,000 fans per game, well below a peak of 62,000.

(Frontiere was not implicated and though the event brought unfavorable media attention, she stood by Dominic Frontiere during his trial and incarceration). The pair divorced in 1987. As the 1990s began, the Rams' fortunes had sunk very low. Most home games were blacked out, and the team hardly figured into the Los Angeles sports scene at all. Frontiere attempted to have a new stadium built in Los Angeles to improve ticket sales but local government officials were not interested due to unfavorable economic conditions (the end of the Cold War had resulted in large-scale layoffs by defense contractors in Southern California). This and the extreme lack of fan support prompted her to move the team to her hometown of St. Louis. St. Louis Rams Lured by incentives like $20 million in annual profits from guaranteed season-ticket sales, personal seat licenses and a favorable lease at the $280-million Trans World Dome that was already in the process of being built, Frontiere transplanted the team to St. Louis in 1995. During the deal, Frontiere also agreed to give up 40% of her ownership to Stan Kroenke, who became a minority owner in the team.

Though fans in Southern California felt scorned, the city of St. Louis welcomed her after losing the Cardinals franchise to Phoenix, Arizona in 1988. After the announced move, the city hosted a rally downtown and thousands of fans chanted \\"Georgia, Georgia!\\" Later Frontiere said, \\"St. Louis is my home, and I brought my team here to start a new dynasty.\\" The Rams struggled for the first few years in their new home, but in the 1999 season, the team led by coach Dick Vermeil, offensive coordinator Mike Martz and an undrafted ex-Arena Football League quarterback, Kurt Warner, defeated the Tennessee Titans to win Super Bowl XXXIV. The team was dubbed \\"the Greatest Show on Turf\\" because of its high scoring offense.Rams agreement in place, ESPN3, Feb 11, 2010. Accessed Dec 15, 2010. The victory served as vindication for Frontiere in the face of criticism from fellow NFL owners and bitter Los Angeles fans. At Super Bowl XXXIV On the night of the victory, Frontiere expressed her desire to succeed, \\"From the time my late husband died, it has been a constant effort to do what he expected me to be able to do.

The film is a story about Dennis (played by Larry Gilliard Jr.), an African-American teen living in a housing project with his sister, mother and abusive, alcoholic father. Fed up with his family's seemingly hopeless future, he plans with his friends to rob a drug dealer. Plot Dennis, living in a Red Hook housing project in Brooklyn, New York has had enough of poverty, and witnessing his alcoholic father beat his mother. His father is depressed and troubled from working hard for \\"the white man\\" for so many years, yet having nothing to show for it. Dennis and two friends come up with a plan to rob a local drug dealer and split the money. One of the friends asks his uncle to borrow his car, and then a connection he has gives him a shotgun for the operation. Dennis keeps telling his girlfriend that they will soon have money and be able to move out of Brooklyn, but he does not actually tell her of the plan. When he does eventually explain what he is about to do, she leaves him and tells him the relationship is over. Meanwhile, his mother loses her job due to the bruises on her face from the ongoing domestic violence. On the day of the robbery, Dennis and his friends wait in the car for the dealer to come out with a briefcase full of cash. As they drive up to him, Dennis points the gun in his face and tells him to hand over the bag, yet he doesn't actually shoot him as his friends were discussing in the car. The dealer complies, and they speed off. The dealer has now seen their faces, and after being ordered by the gangster he works for to get the money back, he goes out looking for the three. When Dennis and his friends take the briefcase back home and realise that it contains much more than they expected, the other two get scared and realize they will be targeted for stealing the bag in the first place. After an argument with Dennis, they leave all the money with him and say they want nothing to do with it. The same night, Dennis brings the money home to show his family and tells them they can move out of the projects, but his father is less than happy about what his son has done. This causes an argument in the house which leads to more violence and Dennis' mother having to go to the hospital. The next day at the hospital, Dennis' father goes out for some air when the drug dealer who was robbed sees him and recognizes who he is. The dealer and his accomplices chase him and he is blocked on both sides and shot dead. At the same time, in the hospital, Dennis' mother dies with her son and daughter by her side. The movie ends with the bloodied father lying still in death, against a fence. Cast * Larry Gilliard, Jr. as Dennis Brown * George T. Odom as Ray Brown * Ann D.

The building opened for business on 20 January 1911. Brief history Designed by one of Michelin's employees, Fran√ßois Espinasse, the building has three large stained-glass windows based on Michelin advertisements of the time, all featuring the Michelin Man \\"Bibendum\\". Around the front of the original building at street level there is a number of decorative tiles showing famous racing cars of the time that used Michelin tyres. More tiles can be found inside the front of the building, which was originally a tyre-fitting bay for passing motorists. People walking into the reception area of the building are still greeted by a mosaic on the floor showing Bibendum holding aloft a glass of nuts, bolts and other hazards, proclaiming \\"Nunc Est Bibendum\\" (Latin for \\"Now is the time to drink\\"). The reception area also features more decorative tiles around its walls. Two glass cupolas, which look like piles of tyres, frame either side of the front of the building. The Michelin company's close association with road maps and tourism is represented by a number of etchings of the streets of Paris on some of the first-floor windows. Michelin moved out of the building in 1985, when it was purchased by publisher Paul Hamlyn and the restaurateur/retailer Sir Terence Conran, who shared a love for the building. They embarked on a major redevelopment that included the restoration of some the original features. The new development also featured offices for Hamlyn's company Octopus Publishing, as well as Conran's Bibendum Restaurant & Oyster Bar, and a Conran Shop. All three businesses opened in August 1987.  Design and construction Patents owned by Dunlop prevented other manufacturers from selling their tyres in Britain, except under licence. The patents were due to expire in the autumn of 1904, and in anticipation of this, Michelin opened an office in Tavistock Place, South Kensington. Michelin sent four employees over from France to Britain to establish the new British branch of the company. Fourteen local staff were also recruited. In June 1905, the Michelin Tyre Company Limited was incorporated. Within a year, the staff had increased to over forty and the company moved into new premises in Sussex Place. When it soon became apparent that the company needed much larger premises, the search for a new site began. A number of different sites were looked into and the earliest plans for a purpose-built London Headquarters date from 1906 for a site on Vauxhall Bridge Road. In 1909, a site on Fulham Road was offered to the company. Fulham Road, one of the main routes into London was considered a great location. Later that same year, a piece of land bordered by Fulham Road, Sloane Avenue, Leader Street and Lucan Place was purchased freehold from Cadgan and Hans Estate Co. Work on a design for the building had already begun and on 4 April 1910, the final designs for Michelin House were completed. Shortly after, work began on the building's construction.  Technical aspects Michelin House is known for its decorative design. What cannot be seen from its exterior or interior design is that it is an early example of concrete construction in Britain. The building was constructed using Hennebique's ferro-concrete construction system. The ferro-concrete system offered great benefits for the construction of clear open spaces (ideal for storing tyres in the most efficient way). It also offered fire resistance properties which were very important when storing large quantities of highly flammable tyres. The system also had the advantage of quick construction; Michelin House took only 5 months to build. The original floors were constructed using hollow pot tiles. This flooring system as well as being highly durable also offered very good fireproofing qualities. Other interesting original features in Michelin House were automatic doors into the entrance hall and a weighing bay in the fitting area which weighed customers' cars so the correct tyre pressure could be applied. Architect The architect behind Michelin House was Fran√ßois Espinasse (1880‚Äì1925), who was employed as an engineer in the construction department at Michelin's headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand. It is believed that he worked on the design of Michelin's Headquarters in Paris (1908), but this is the only other known architectural work of his. The French Order of Architects in Paris have no record of him. Not much else is known about him other than he spent most of his working life at Michelin.  Architectural style  It is hard to define the architectural style of Michelin House. It was designed and built at the end of the Art-Nouveau period; parts of this style can be seen in the decorative metal work at the front of the building above the fitting bays, and the tangling plants round the tyre motifs at the front and side of the building, and also in the mosaic in the entrance hall. Despite this, Michelin House is very much like an Art-Deco building, the popular style of the 1930s with its prominent roadside position and its strong advertising images. In this respect, Michelin House is a building twenty years before its time and is also the first of the highly decorated buildings 'built on tyres', as Michelin House was built before Fort Dunlop (1916) and the Firestone Building (1928‚Äì1980). Michelin House has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since April 1969. Rise and fall On 20 January 1911, Michelin House was officially opened. The building offered everything the motorist of the time required. Fitting bays at the front of the building allowed motorist to have their tyres speedily changed by Michelin fitters from the stock of over 30,000 stored in the basement. Tyres were brought up on a lift and rolled to the front of the building along the purposely sloped floor. To the left of the front recipient, a 'Touring Office' provided maps and writing implements for the keen motorist to plan his or her journey. Within a year of opening, work started on an extension to the building to provide additional office space and included a second floor. The extension was built along the Lucan Place side of the building. A further extension was built in 1922, ten years after the first. Located where a garage had stood, it reached three floors. In 1927, Michelin built a factory in Stoke-on-Trent using the firm of Peter Lind & Company of London. The factory started producing the first British made Michelin tyres and in 1930, the company moved their head office to Stoke-on-Trent. Michelin continued to use the basement and the ground floor of the building, but over two-thirds were left empty. Between 1933 and 1940, the upper storeys were let as a furniture warehouse, a workshop and offices for the Air Ministry. In 1940, because of the risk of bombing, Michelin removed the three stained glass windows. They were carefully packed into wooden crates and sent to the Stoke-on-Trent factory for safe keeping. After the war, Michelin returned its headquarters to London. The reduced staff meant only the front, original part of the building was occupied, while the rest of the building was leased. In 1950, a long term lease was signed by a new tenant for the space created in the 1912 and 1922 extensions. In 1952, an extension was added for the tenant. A steel frame construction, it extended part of the second floor and added a third floor along the Lucan Place side of the building. In 1960, Michelin and their tenant began a modernisation programme for the interior of the building. The programme went along with the general taste of the time, dividing the open plan office and making much use of wood panelling. Although the work concentrated on the interior of the building, updating the exterior of the building with a cement rendered facade was considered. On 15 April 1969 the original front section of the Michelin Building was given a Grade II listing. Despite this, outline planning permission was granted to demolish all but the listed part and build a ten- storey office block. Michelin instead decided to spend the money on a new factory in North America. Sale In 1985, Michelin put the building up for sale. It was located in an expensive and fashionable part of London, but did not fit their office requirements. Of the many people who made bids to buy Michelin House, the restaurateur and retailer Sir Terence Conran and Paul Hamlyn, owner of the Octopus Publishing Group, were friends who when they discovered they had been bidding against each other, formed a partnership to purchase it. In August 1985, it was sold to them for 8 million pounds. Plans were then set into action to create a new lease of life for Michelin House. Rebirth Conran and Hamlyn set up Michelin House Developments to redevelop the building, to include a major retailing store, restaurant, bar and large office space. In November 1985, Conran Roche and YRM, the architects and designers placed in charge, made an application for planning permission to increase the existing floor area from 90,000 to . This was to be achieved by building a new steel and glass structure that would fill the space occupied by the side loading bay on the Sloane Avenue side, and by also adding a new neater front end to the third floor plus a new fourth floor and plant room above. Planning permission was granted and work began. The chief contractor was Bovis, who worked on the shell and core. Conran Roche worked on the interior of the new Conran Shop, and YRM worked on the interiors of the Octopus Publishing offices. Conran Roche and YRM had to search for suppliers to recreate many of the building's original features. The three stained glass windows which had been removed for safety during the Second World War had been lost and the glass cupolas at the front of the building had disappeared. After a long search, suppliers were found, and replicas of the windows and cupolas were made using original drawings, photos and posters. In August 1987, Michelin House re-opened. Recent history In the late 1990s, Reed/Octopus Publishing moved out. In 1999, Monitor Group, an international business consulting firm, moved into the office space. Centennial 20 January 2011 marked the 100th anniversary of the building's opening. The event was celebrated by the building's then occupants, Bibendum Restaurant and The Conran Shop, and the former owner, Michelin. As part of the centennial, Michelin has renewed its efforts to find the original stained glass windows. A stained glass amnesty website and hotline have been set up for this purpose.

Originally differentiated by the approach used to engineer them, RASSLs and DREADDs are often used interchangeably now to represent an engineered G-protein receptor-ligand system. These systems utilize G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic ligands, like clozapine N-oxide (CNO), and not to their natural ligand(s).  Types of RASSLs / DREADDs  One of the first DREADDs was based on the human M3 muscarinic receptor (hM3). Only two point mutations of hM3 were required to achieve a mutant receptor with nanomolar potency for CNO, insensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and low constitutive activity and this DREADD receptor was named hM3Dq. M1 and M5 muscarinic receptors have been mutated to create DREADDs hM1Dq and hM5Dq respectively. The most commonly used inhibitory DREADD is hM4Di, derived from the M4 muscarinic receptor that couples with the Gi protein. Another Gi coupled human muscarinic receptor, M2, was also mutated to obtain the DREADD receptor hM2D. Another inhibitory Gi- DREADD is the kappa-opioid-receptor (KOR) DREADD (KORD) which is selectively activated by salvinorin B (SALB). Gs-coupled DREADDs have also been developed. These receptors are also known as GsD and are chimeric receptors containing intracellular regions of the turkey erythrocyte Œ≤-adrenergic receptor substituted into the rat M3 DREADD.  RASSL / DREADD ligands  A growing number of ligands that can be used to activate RASSLs / DREADDs are commercially available. Clozapine N-oxide (CNO) is the prototypical DREADD activator. CNO activates the excitatory Gq- coupled DREADDs: hM3Dq, hM1Dq and hM5Dq and also the inhibitory hM4Di and hM2Di Gi-coupled DREADDs. CNO also activates the Gs-coupled DREADD (GsD) and the Œ≤-arrestin preferring DREADD: rM3Darr (Rq(R165L). Recent findings suggest that systemically administered CNO does not readily cross the blood-brain-barrier in vivo and converts to clozapine which itself activates DREADDs. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic which has been indicated to show high DREADD affinity and potency. Subthreshold injections of clozapine itself can be utilised to induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors. Therefore when using CNO, care must be taken in experimental design and proper controls should be incorporated. DREADD agonist 21 (AKA Compound 21) represents an alternative agonist for muscarinic-based DREADDs and an alternative to CNO. It has been reported that DREADD agonist 21 (Compound 21) has excellent bioavailability, pharmacokinetic properties and brain penetrability and does not undergo back metabolism to clozapine. Perlapine, a drug already approved for treating insomnia in Japan is an activator of Gq-, Gi-, and Gs DREADDs that has structural similarity to CNO. Salvinorin B is a brain penetrant, potent and selective activator of Œ∫-opioid DREADD (KORD). JHU37160 and JHU37152 have been marketed commercially as novel DREADD ligands, active in vivo, with high potency and affinity for hM3Dq and hM4Di DREADDs. Diihydrochloride salts of DREADDs ligands that are water-soluble (but with differing stabilities in solution) have also been commercially developed (see for aqueous stability). Mechanism RASSLs and DREADDs are families of designer G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) built specifically to allow for precise spatiotemporal control of GPCR signaling in vivo. These engineered GPCRs, called RASSLs (receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands), are unresponsive to endogenous ligands but can be activated by nanomolar concentrations of pharmacologically inert, drug-like small molecules. Currently, RASSLs exist for the interrogation of several GPCR signaling pathways, including those activated by Gs, Gi, Gq, Golf and Œ≤-arrestin. A major cause for success of RASSL resources has been open exchange of DNA constructs, and RASSL related resources. The hM4Di-DREADD's inhibitory effects are a result of the CNO's stimulation and resulting activation of the G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. This causes hyperpolarization of the targeted neuronal cell and thus attenuates subsequent activity. Uses GPCRs are the target for some of the most widely used pharmaceuticals to treat diseases that involve virtually all tissues of the body. Viral expression of DREADD proteins, both in-vivo enhancers and inhibitors of neuronal function, have been used to bidirectionally control behaviors in mice (e.g odor discrimination). Due to their ability to modulate neuronal activity, DREADDs are used as a tool to evaluate both the neuronal pathways and behaviors associated with drug-cues and drug addiction. History Strader and colleagues designed the first GPCR which could be activated only by a synthetic compound and has gradually been gaining momentum. The first international RASSL meeting was scheduled for April 6, 2006. A simple example of the use of a RASSL system in behavioral genetics was illustrated by Mueller et al. (2005) where they showed that expressing a RASSL receptor in sweet taste cells of the mouse tongue led to a strong preference for oral consumption of the synthetic ligand, whereas expressing the RASSL in bitter taste cells caused dramatic taste aversion for the same compound. The attenuating effects of the hM4Di-DREADD were originally explored in 2007, before being confirmed in 2014.

European settlers first called the river Drowning Creek, which still is the name of its headwater. The waterway known as the Lumber River extends downstream from the Scotland County-Hoke County border to the North Carolina-South Carolina border. Soon after crossing into South Carolina, the Lumber River flows into the Little Pee Dee River, which flows into the Pee Dee River, or Great Pee Dee River. Finally, the combined waters flow into Winyah Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1989, the river was designated as a \\"Natural and Scenic River\\" by the North Carolina General Assembly. In addition, it is the only blackwater river in North Carolina to be designated as a National Wild and Scenic River by the Department of the Interior. In 2010, the Lumber River was voted one of North Carolina‚Äôs Ten Natural Wonders, the result of an on-line contest held by Land for Tomorrow, a coalition dedicated to supporting the preservation of North Carolina‚Äôs land and water resources.  History   Ancient indigenous peoples  Evidence from archeological excavations along the Lumber River has shown that successive cultures of indigenous Native Americans inhabited this area for thousands of years. A number of archaeological sites have been excavated on high ground along the river. While many have been disturbed by the agricultural practices of the post-Columbian era, numerous artifacts and some fossils have been recovered. These include a dugout canoe made by indigenous people and estimated to be over 1,025 years old. This ancient canoe is on display at the Native American Resource Center at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Much of the archaeological work in the Lumber River region has been done in Robeson County. A total of 429 archaeological sites have been recorded in this area. The sites contain components from various archaeological periods: Paleo-Indian, Archaic Woodland, Mississippian and Historic (after European encounter). Iroquoian, Siouan, and Carolina Algonquian-speaking peoples were among the historic tribes who lived in the coastal and inland region prior to European encounter. Archeologists have identified 47 sites of potential importance, 20 of which are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.  Eighteenth century  Early English surveyors named the river \\"Drowning Creek.\\" In 1749, British colonial records identified the river as a branch of the Little Pee Dee River. In 1809, the North Carolina state legislature changed the name of the river to Lumber, most likely to symbolize the thriving lumber industry in the area, and its use of the river for transporting logs. They wanted a name more positive than Drowning Creek.  Nineteenth century  In the late 18th and the 19th centuries, the lumbering and naval stores industries were critical to the region's economy. The Lumber River became a vital route for transporting 100-foot logs downriver to the seaport of Georgetown, South Carolina. Lumberton, North Carolina was important for the timber industry and associated production of turpentine. The visible remaining bridge abutments, tram bridges, and dock pilings are reminders of the critical importance of lumbering and naval stores industries to the area as a whole.  Recreation  In the 21st century, the Lumber River is a highly prized recreation corridor in North Carolina. Active outdoor recreation and festivals are among the most popular activities, including canoeing, boating, fishing, hunting, picnicking, camping, nature study, swimming, biking, jogging, crafts, and fossil and artifact hunting.  Lumber River State Park  The Lumber and some of its adjoining banks are part of the Lumber River State Park, which comprises 9,874 acres of land and 115 miles of waterway. The park‚Äôs recreational activities are currently at Princess Ann Access in the south and the Chalk Banks access to the north (near the town of Wagram).chalkbanks.com There are 24 boat launches along the Lumber River that serve as access points to Lumber River State Park. The entire length of the river is open to fishing. The common game fish are black crappie, largemouth bass, catfish and redbreast sunfish. All anglers must have a valid fishing license and follow the regulations of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Nine primitive camping sites are located at the Princess Ann section of the park, between Orrum and Fair Bluff. These campsites are meant to be used by no more than 6 people at a time. Each camp site features, a picnic table and grill, lantern holder, trash can, and fire ring. There are several hiking trails and picnic areas at Princess Ann as well as the many municipal and county parks that are located on the Lumber River. Fourteen individual campsites are available at the Chalk Banks Access Area in Scotland County for family camping. Each site has a table, lantern holder, trash can and fire pit. Canoe- in campsites are also available.

The village is about three miles (5 km) south of Midhurst on the main A286 road to Chichester. In the 2001 census there were 190 households in the civil parish with a total population of 459 of whom 223 were economically active. In 2011, the population was 420. History and notable buildings Cocking (Cochinges) was listed in the Domesday Book (1086) in the ancient hundred of Easebourne as having 32 households: 18 cottagers, eight smallholders and six slaves; with ploughing land, five mills and a church, it had a value to the lord of the manor of ¬£15. The 11th century Anglican parish church had no known dedication until 2007 when it was dedicated to St. Catherine of Siena. There was a Congregational Chapel in Crypt Lane, founded in 1806 and rebuilt in 1907, which is now closed. In the centre of the village, on the corner of Mill Lane, stands the old school, now a private residence. This was built in 1870 to the designs of architects Richard Carpenter and William Slater. The school has Gothic-style windows and door arches, is faced in flint with a red tiled roof and decorative barge- boards to the gables. The former schoolmaster's house has a distinctive chimney-stack with four outlets. To the south of the village are the remains of Cocking Lime Works, abandoned in 1999, and the associated chalk pit, while to the north are a few traces of the Chorley Iron Foundry, which cast the waterwheels now at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum and at the Coultershaw Beam Pump. There still remain in the village some houses of 17th century origin. In 1931 the population of the village was 431. There was a Richard Cobden pub in Cocking which closed and became a private residence in the 20th century. Richard Cobden lived in nearby Heyshott. Transport A railway once used to serve the area at Cocking Station, on the Chichester to Midhurst line opened in 1880, but was completely closed from 1953. The village is on the Stagecoach South No.60 bus route which runs from Midhurst to Chichester. Today A number of buildings in the village belong to the Cowdray Estate, distinguished by their external woodwork painted yellow. The remaining village pub, formerly The Blue Bell, became a restaurant with accommodation called The Bluebell Inn, and stands on the corner of Bell Lane. Cocking is on the South Downs Way long-distance footpath.

In an attempt to undermine support for Caesar, Gnaeus Pompey attacked Bogud's territory, but was driven back. This only provoked Bogud into full-scale action against the Pompeians. Caesar sent P. Sitius to aid Bogud in an attack on the territory of King Juba I of Numidia, whose army was advancing to join the Pompeians. Bogud captured the town of Cirta, forcing Juba to return home with his army, abandoning the Pompeians.

Volume 2, Biblo and Tannen, New York, 1963, p.639. On Caesar's victory over the Pompeian forces led by Metellus Scipio at the Battle of Thapsus (on the coast of modern Tunisia) in 46 BC, Bocchus was given control of much of Numidia taken from Juba. Bogud also participated in the Battle of Munda, launching an important attack on the rear of the Pompeian army that provoked the Pompeians in a confused reaction that soon broke their forces.John Hazel, Who's Who in the Roman World, Routledge, London, 2001, p.38. Spain During Quintus Cassius Longinus's governorship of Hispania Ulterior, a rebellion occurred which threatened Caesar's regime, which had never been popular in Spain. Cassius asked for support, which Bogud provided. However, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus intervened on Caesar's orders to mediate. Lepidus helped to restore order, but negotiated an agreement with the rebels. A surprise attack by Bogud's auxiliaries was defeated and Cassius was forced to resign.Richard D. Weigel, Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir, Routledge, New York, 1992, p.28. Bogud then withdrew back to Mauretania. Support for Antony After Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, the two Mauretanian rulers took opposite sides in the split that developed in the Caesarian forces. Bogud supported Mark Antony, while Bocchus stood by Octavian (later the emperor Augustus). About 38 BC, Bocchus seized Bogud's territory while Bogud was campaigning in Spain and forced him to flee to Antony in the east. Bocchus then became sole ruler of Mauretania and was so confirmed by Octavian. Bogud died in Antony's Actium campaign, during the fighting at Methone. On his own death, King Bocchus II willed Mauretania to Octavian in 33 BC.

Carter (May 6, 1891 ‚Äì April 7, 1992) was an artist and woodcarver from the Pacific Northwest. His works are on display in the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon and California. There are also works of his on display in Japan and Germany. Carter was a participant in the \\"Art in Action\\" program during the 1940 season of the Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE). He was also the first King County, Washington Parks and Recreation artist-in- residence when he was 96 years old. Early life Carter was born to a pioneer family on May 6, 1891, in New Westminster, Canada. His father was originally from Barbados, and his mother was from Quebec; they came west in 1891, shortly before Dudley was born. He was a timber cruiser and forest engineer most of his life, exploring and mapping Pacific Northwest wilderness. The chief inspiration for Carter's art was his childhood among the Kwakiutl and Tlingit Indians. He moved to Washington state in 1928. Diego Rivera and City College of San Francisco Carter was a participant during 1940, in the \\"Art in Action\\" exhibitions during the 1939‚Äì1940 Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) on Treasure Island. During that time he became a friend of Diego Rivera, who included Carter three separate times in his mural Marriage of the Artistic Expression of the North and of the South on this Continent and once in the Pan American Unity mural. Rivera said the following about Carter:Theme , Diego Rivera Mural Project. Retrieved March 25, 2006. There are three works by Carter on the City College of San Francisco Ocean Campus, The Ram (sometimes called the Mountain Ram),Goddess of the Forest, and The Beast. Dudley had donated The Ram because he knew it was the school mascot and it had been part of the Golden Gate International Exposition's Arts in Action exhibition. The Ram sculpture stood outside on the campus periodically changing locations from time to time, students would coat it in paint with campus colors red and white. Sometimes rival schools would repaint The Ram in their own school colors. By 1980, The Ram had many layers of paint and damage and in spring of 1983 it was restored by Carter with use of a pick axe and its original, natural redwood. Currently located in the lobby of Conlan Hall, on the Ocean Campus. The Goddess of the Forest is another redwood sculpture created during GGIE. It is very large, standing at 26 feet tall, and had a girth at the base of 21 feet. For years this piece was located at Golden Gate Park, until 1986, when it began to show distress and decay. It was then moved to CCSF, to an indoor location awaiting restoration. Maple Valley - Lake Wilderness Lodge In 1951, Carter designed and carved the central column of the award-winning Gaffney's Lodge, now Lake Wilderness Lodge, in Maple Valley, Washington. Clackamas In 1979, at the age of eighty-eight, Carter was commissioned to carve three large cedars for the Clackamas Town Center shopping mall, located in the southeastern part of the Portland metropolitan area in Oregon. The trees selected for the project came from Mt. St. Helens six months before the volcanic eruption of 1980 that eliminated much of the forest. Carter lived in a small trailer on the shopping center's construction site while carving the trees. In 1981, the sculptures were moved into the central court next to a skating rink, where they remained until a major remodel of the center in 2004. The next year they were transferred to the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center Museum. Influence in Washington state When ninety-six years old, Carter became the first artist-in-residence of the King County Parks and Recreation Department. He had a home at 7447 159th Place NE, Redmond, Washington. Located in Slough House Park, the house was named \\"Haida House Studio\\". After a brief illness the artist died in his sleep at the Slough House residence, just a month short of his 101st birthday on April 7, 1992. He is buried near Stave Falls, B.C. Slough House is now owned by the city of Redmond. The artist bequest included his art studio, fashioned in the manner of a native Haida dwelling, and a group of monumental wood sculptures of the sort that brought the sculptor to international prominence. Upon his death, Congressman Rod Chandler honored Carter with remarks in the Congressional Record. Selected works Various works by Carter: Signature of Dudley C.

Archaeological evidence indicates cannabis with high levels of THC was being smoked at least 2,500 years ago. In addition to being smoked and vaporized, cannabis and its active cannabinoids may be ingested, placed under the tongue, or applied to the skin. The bioavailability characteristics and effects of smoking and vaporizing cannabis differ from other cannabis consumption methods in having a more rapid and predictable onset of effect.  Smoking methods  Sebsi, a Moroccan long-drawtube one- hitter. Cannabis (marijuana) can be smoked in a variety of pipe-like implements made in different shapes and of different materials including hand pipes (\\"bowls\\"), water pipes (\\"bongs\\"), cigarettes (\\"joints\\"), or blunts.  Joint  Joint is a slang term for a cigarette filled with cannabis instead of tobacco. Alternatively, mainly in Europe, joints may contain tobacco (commonly dubbed \\"a spliff\\", but not to be confused with the Jamaican term Spliff, which refers to a large joint) or various non-addictive herbs. Sometimes a joint will contain kief or hashish; hashish can be heated and made to crumble before placement within the joint. Specially manufactured rolling papers are most often used in industrialized countries; however, recycled brown paper and newspaper are commonly used in the developing world. Modern papers are now made from a wide variety of materials including rice, hemp, soy, and flax. A joint typically contains 250‚Äì750 mg net weight of cannabis and/or fillers.  Blunt  A blunt is cannabis rolled with a cigar wrapper (usually tobacco leaf, which contains nicotine). Blunts are often made with blunt wraps: tobacco-based wraps ‚Äî often flavored ‚Äî that are related to the wraps used on a blunt cigar and are often used to roll cannabis  Pipe or bowl  thumb Pipes made for smoking cannabis, sometimes called pieces or bowls, are made of a variety of materials, including metal fittings, ceramic, borosilicate glass, stone, wood, bamboo among other materials. Subtypes include one-hitters, bubblers, chillums, glass blunts, corn cob pipes, and standard hand pipes. Pipes vary greatly in shape and materials, and most are handmade. The common thread between them is having a narrow screened receptacle (\\"bowl\\"), a \\"stem\\" (which may be a long flexible tube as on hookahs and vaporizers), and a \\"mouthpiece\\". The smoking material is placed in the receptacle and affected with a heat source while air is drawn through the bowl and stem to the user. Blown-glass pipes and bongs are often intricately and colorfully designed. In India and Jamaica, the most commonly used pipe is the chillum.; in the UAE, midwakh; in Morocco, sebsi. * A One-hitter is a device used for a single serving (usually 25 mg). * Chalice is a cannabis smoking pipe used most often by members of the Jamaican Rastafari movement. Bubbler A bubbler is a mix of a bong and a pipe. They tend to look like small bongs and are another way to smoke cannabis. A bubbler contains a chamber for water, commonly with a down stem directly connected to the bowl of the piece. A bubbler normally has a dedicated carburetor, a hole which is usually covered with the finger then opened for mixing clean air with the smoke to make inhaling easier. Because of the carburetor there is no need to pull the stem as you would with a bong.  Bong  A glass bong filled with water and its bowl packed with cannabis. A man demonstrates how to use a bong to inhale smoke A bong is similar to a pipe, only it has a water-chamber through which cannabis smoke passes prior to inhalation. Users fill the bong with water, sometimes also adding ice in order to cool the smoke. This cooling effect reduces the discomfort caused by the heat of the smoke. The bowl and stem assembly of most bongs is removed briefly after the cannabis is burned, allowing clean air to circulate and clear the smoke chamber, ensuring no smoke dissipates without being properly consumed. However, some users prefer to instead inhale with sufficient force to pull the burnt ash of the cannabis through the bowl's air hole, down the stem and into the water. This is done to eliminate the needs to remove the bowl and stem assembly and clean the bowl for further use. For example, this method is used in Australia.  Gravity bong  A gravity bong (also known as a grav, bucket, submarine, geeb, or GB) is a hydropneumatic device used for smoking cannabis. One variant consists of a bucket of water in which is typically placed a bottle with the bottom cut off, such as a 2-litre PET soft drink bottle. Some kind of cap or screen is rigged over the mouth of the bottle and filled with hash or cannabis. A flame is then held near enough to heat the drug while the bottle is slowly raised out of the water, creating a negative gauge pressure inside the bottle, drawing smoke from the heated cannabis‚Äîalong with air‚Äîinto the vacuum. The cap or screen is removed once the bottle is almost full, the user's mouth is placed over the mouth of the bottle and the bottle pushed back down into the water, causing the pressure to rise and forcing the smoke into the lungs. There are many variants on this basic premise, such as using a large water cooler tank in lieu of a soft drink bottle. Waterfall (gravity) bong Similar to a gravity bong, a waterfall bong utilizes both a bottle and a cap or screen rigged over the bottle's mouth to hold cannabis. In this case, however, the bottle‚Äîwhich has one or several holes drilled near or at the bottom‚Äîis either filled with water or placed in a larger container filled with water before the cannabis is packed. The holes are then uncovered, or the bottle is simply raised from the container, evacuating the water either onto the ground or back into the container. When heat is applied to the drug, the resultant smoke is forced into the bottle with negative gauge pressure, as with the gravity bong. Once the water is evacuated, the smoke can be inhaled from the bottle. Variations on this concept are also used.  Vaporizers  Vaporizers (vape pens and/or stationary platform) are devices used to extract the active ingredients of cannabis, tobacco (E-cigarettes), or any plant material at lower than burning temperature, eliminating carbon monoxide and carcinogenic \\"tars\\" found hazardous in smoke. 197 ¬∞C / 385 ¬∞F is frequently mentioned as a good vaporizing temperature for favored cannabinoids. Utensils usually thought of as smoking pipes can be used to vaporize if the receptacle, or \\"bowl\\", is narrow enough to permit controlling the inward flow of heated air from a source such as a lighter which is held far enough below the opening. According to the journal Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, vaporizing cannabis is a safe and more effective way (than smoking) of delivering THC to patients for medical uses. The feasibility of vaporization of THC has been demonstrated in a series of laboratory studies involving different vaporizer designs. An electric vaporizer was shown to release substantial amounts of the THC while producing no measurable amounts of benzene, toluene, and naphthalene, which are generated when marijuana is smoked. Spots Spotting knives heating Glass blades Spotting refers to a method of smoking cannabis.\\"Handbook of Pharmacy Education\\", Harmen R.J., 2001, Pg 169 In this method, small pieces of cannabis are rolled (or simply torn from a larger bud) to form the \\"spot\\". Generally, the tips of two knife blades are heated, the spot is compressed between the two blades, and the subsequent smoke is inhaled through the nose or mouth. This method of smoking is also referred to as \\"hot knives\\" because of the heated blades. Another means that is gaining popularity is specially made glass presses heated with a propane or butane torch. In order to facilitate this process, a \\"spottle\\" (also referred to as a \\"bowser\\", \\"hooter\\" or \\"toker\\") is often, but not always, used to funnel the smoke and maximize the amount inhaled. A spottle is generally made from a funnel or cone-shaped container, such as the top (or neck) of a plastic or glass bottle or a gallon of milk/water.\\"Understanding street drugs: a handbook of substance misuse for parents, teachers and other professionals\\", Emmett D. & Nice G. 2006, Pg 41\\"James Bong's Ultimate SpyGuide to Marijuana\\", Arooka, Pg 186 Hotboxing This method involves multiple persons smoking cannabis in an enclosed space, such as a car, with no way for smoke to escape. In addition to the primary smoke from the chosen smoking device(s), secondhand smoke is repeatedly inhaled and exhaled. A single user breathing in and out of a breathbonnet (breadbag) can achieve this effect.  Health effects of smoking  Some data on the correlation of an increase in the incidence of lung cancer and cannabis smoking are conflicting. A systematic review evaluating 19 studies from 1966 to 2006 found no significant tobacco-adjusted association between cannabis smoking and lung cancer development despite evidence of precancerous histopathologic changes of the respiratory mucosa. Cannabis smoke was listed as a cancer agent in California in 2009. Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogens as tar from tobacco smoke. A 2012 literature survey by the British Lung Foundation identified cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also found awareness of the danger was low, with 40% of under 35s thinking that cannabis (when smoked) was not harmful. Other observations include lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone due to common mixing of cannabis and tobacco and frequent cigarette smoking by cannabis users; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco. A 2013 literature review said that exposure to cannabis had biologically-based physical, mental, behavioral and social health consequences and was \\"associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis C), lungs, heart, and vasculature\\". The authors cautioned that \\"evidence is needed, and further research should be considered, to prove causal associations of marijuana with many physical health conditions\\".

History It was built by the Midland Railway and was designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders and opened in 1870 called Ecclesall. This was changed, first to Ecclesall & Millhouses and later Mill Houses & Ecclesall before becoming Millhouses and Ecclesall in 1932. It was situated on the Midland Main Line between Heeley railway station and Beauchief station, and was accessed from the Archer Road overbridge, near the junction of Abbeydale Road and Millhouses Lane. The station was opened at the same time as the main line from Chesterfield with just 2 flanking platforms. Between 1901 and 1903 the line was widened and two lines added. The station now consisted of 4 platforms with two flanking platforms and an island platform in the centre. The station buildings were situated at road level with access by steps to the island platform. The station closed on 10 June 1968, and remained derelict for many years. The station buildings and platforms were finally removed in the 1980s, but the stationmaster's house survives as a private home. Calls for reopening There have been numerous plans to rebuild a station, going as far as a feasibility study in 1997,Millhouses Station - Operational, and Economic Feasibility Study but so far none have come to fruition. In July 2017, it was proposed by Local Enterprise Partnership that new stations should be built at Millhouses and Heeley as well as new platforms at Dore & Totley. The plans would be part of a call to have better links in South Yorkshire area as well as plans for a new Woodhead Route reopening. In 2020, local MP Olivia Blake wrote to the transport secretary asking him to consider the reopening of the station, suggesting it would reduce congestion in the area.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and broadcasts with 520 watts ERP from the Illinois Mountain master tower in Highland, New York to which it moved in 2000. Unlike other Class A stations on that tower, WRNQ's signal is directional to protect first adjacents WNYL New York City and WFLY Troy. A variation of WRNQ's format, without the simulcast and with different jocks, is broadcast on 98.5 WCTW Catskill, New York. From March 2005 until November 2006, WRNQ's format and programming is \\"shadowcasted\\" on 99.3 WFKP Ellenville, New York which aired the same air talent as WRNQ (and simulcasted WRNQ's \\"Joe Daily in the Morning\\"). History The original construction permit for what became WRNQ was awarded in December 1985, several years after the FCC amended the table of allotments to allow for the 92.1 frequency to become active in Poughkeepsie. Around 1987, the frequency was awarded to WKIP owner Richard Novik, gained the WLMS (Lite Music Station) calls and announced that the station would take on a format near-identical to that which hit the air. Due to potential ratings confusion with WLTW (\\"Lite FM\\") from New York City the call letters were replaced with WRNQ in 1989, a decision made by then-General Manager Don Verity. The difficulty obtaining a transmitter site in the market also was a problem and Novik eventually settled on a site in Lagrangeville, New York, east of Poughkeepsie, unlike most stations which broadcast on mountain peaks in Ulster County. WRNQ, better known as \\"Rockin' Easy, Q-92\\"' hit the air on June 30, 1989 and made a splash with former WKIP morning man Van Ritshie anchoring an otherwise satellite-fed format (Unistar's \\"Format 41).\\" With no real competition in the format (WHUD was still easy listening and WKIP had changed to all-talk programming), Q-92 reached top of the ratings its first year on the air. Eventually, the station added the hugely successful \\"Love Songs on Q\\" a locally hosted evening love songs program hosted by Pete Clark (currently at WVKR and WPDH) and later by Rick Buser, formerly of WPDH. In 1996, Novik sold WRNQ, WKIP, and new sister station WNSX (\\"Modern Rock, The X 96.1\\") to Straus Media (owned by Eric Straus, heir to former owner of WMCA New York City) who in turn replaced the satellite-fed time periods with all- local programming, much of which came from Straus stations in Ellenville and Hudson. With this, the station picked up Delilah After Dark evenings. The pickup of Delilah, later picked up by rival WHUD, was allowed via a geographic loophole (WHUD and WRNQ are technically in different markets) which also allowed the two rivals to have the same jingle package for several years. Eric Straus decided to leave radio ownership in 2000 to start two online ventures (Regional Help Wanted and Cupid.com), selling the cluster to Clear Channel Communications. The next year, Van Ritshie retired from radio, and was replaced by Joe Daily (formerly of WBNR) in the morning slot. In 2002, WRNQ began airing Christmas music in the months before Christmas copying a programming move popular in other radio markets. At the end of Christmas music in 2003, the station relaunched under the \\"LiteFM\\" brand of popular sister WLTW in New York City in a move of \\"branding unity\\" which also was ironic considering the station's pre-signon change done to minimize confusion with WLTW. Outside of some music refocusing and the addition of a Saturday night dance programming, no major changes were made until October 2011, when WRNQ switched to Premium Choice and Premiere Networks for content outside of Joe Daily in Morning Drive.

Security forces Although an increasingly small percentage of total human rights abuses reported were attributed to security forces, some members continued to commit serious abuses, including unlawful and extrajudicial killings. Some members collaborated with the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia paramilitary terrorist group, which has committed serious abuses. Allegations of forced disappearances and kidnappings remained. In 2003 there were allegations of arbitrary arrests and detentions, and prolonged pretrial detention remained a fundamental problem. Impunity remained at the core of the country's human rights problems. Free speech The constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Individuals criticize the government both publicly and in private, and the media express a wide spectrum of political viewpoints and often sharply criticize the government, all without fear of government reprisal. Journalism However, journalists practice self-censorship to avoid retaliation and harassment by criminals and members of illegal armed groups. Colombia is one of the most dangerous countries in which to practice the profession of journalism; a number of journalists are killed almost every year, and journalists continue to work in an atmosphere of threats and intimidation, in some instances from corrupt local officials in collaboration with paramilitary groups, but primarily from terrorist groups. Civilian informants  A key component of the government's \\"Democratic Security Strategy\\" to combat terrorism and restore order throughout the country is a network of civilian informants who are paid to identify terrorist activists and sympathizers. Many national and international human rights groups have criticized the network as vulnerable to abuse and as a threat to privacy and other civil liberties. Prisoners The National Penitentiary and Prison Institute (Instituto Nacional Penitenciario y Carcelario‚ÄîINPEC) is in charge of the prison system. Many of INPEC's 8,756 prison guards are poorly trained or corrupt. Police, prison guards, and military forces routinely mistreat detainees. Conditions in the severely overcrowded and under-funded prisons are harsh, especially for prisoners without significant outside support, and prisoners frequently rely on bribes for favorable treatment. The government does not hold political prisoners, although in 2003 it held approximately 6,800 prisoners accused of terrorism, rebellion, or aiding and abetting insurgency.

The Model 1795 was the first musket to be produced in the United States by Eli Whitney. It was based heavily on the Charleville musket, Model 1763/66, which had been imported in large numbers from the French during the American Revolution, and which at the time comprised the largest number of muskets in U.S. arsenals at about 20,000 muskets. The Model 1795 was used in the War of 1812, after which shortcomings in both the design and manufacturing process of the Model 1795 led to the development of the Model 1812 Musket at Springfield only, and eventually the Model 1816 Musket muskets at both armories. Characteristics The Model 1795, a very elongated musket, retained many of the characteristics of the Charleville on which it was based. It had a long .69 caliber barrel, a stock, and a total length of . The original version had the bayonet lug on the bottom of the barrel but this was later moved to the top. Minor changes were made throughout production inclusive of a shorter barrel length of on the later Harper's Ferry weapons. Barrels of Harper's Ferry 1795s were serial numbered up to some point in 1812: Springfield Model 1795's were never serial numbered. Springfield began the Model 1812 improvements in 1814, but Harper's Ferry continued on with the production of the Model 1795 until at least 1819 (early 1819 examples still used the M1795 lockplate) and never produced the Model 1812. Eventually, both armories incorporated improvements into the Model 1816 flintlock which were after a few years virtually identical. Most, but not all, parts will interchange on the Model 1816 muskets but the hand-crafted parts, and lack of set standards and patterns on the earlier Model 1795 weapons often means parts will not interchange easily. Typical of smoothbore muskets, the M1795 had an effective range of about to . The Model 1795 fired a smaller round than the British .75 caliber Brown Bess, but the Model 1795 also had both a slightly longer range and slightly better accuracy than the Brown Bess musket. This gave the American forces an advantage of range when they faced British forces in the War of 1812.\\"Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law\\", by Gregg Lee Carter, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2002 Production The Model 1795 was manufactured at the United States Armory and Arsenal at Springfield, which was the first armory in the United States, at least as early as 1799. Earlier versions prior to this date probably were produced but were not dated. Starting in 1801, possibly as early as 1800, it was also produced in the then new United States Armory and Arsenal at Harper's Ferry. Several differences between the Springfield Model 1795 and the Harper's Ferry Model 1795 have led many to label the Harper's Ferry version as a significantly different model. Quite a few independent contractors also made the weapon as they were in constant demand. The federal armories simply could not make enough muskets to meet demand with the labor force they had during these early years. Only about two dozen artisans worked in the Harpers Ferry arsenal around 1800, and making the muskets from raw materials was a very labor-intensive task. Approximately 80,000 Springfield Model 1795 muskets were produced while about 70,000 were produced at Harper's Ferry.Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms, 2001 Service history Model 1795s were used throughout the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìWar of 1846‚Äì48, and the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì65. Most were converted to percussion caps either at the armories or by private individuals, but records reflect that many in the South were issued an original flintlock at the beginning of the Civil War until the Confederates could convert them to percussion. There is some evidence that some were in fact never converted at all from flintlock. The effective service life of the Model 1795 thus extends through 1865. The Model 1795 was also used by some members of the Lewis and Clark expedition.\\"Lewis & Clark Tailor Made, Trail Worn: Army Life, Clothing & Weapons of the Corps of Discovery\\", by Robert John Moore, Robert J.

He was an eighth generation descendant Zhu Jing, Prince Ding of Tang, who was 23rd son of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang., note 24. Early life Before ascending to the throne, he followed his father as the Prince of Tang, their fief being situated in Nanyang prefecture, in Henan province. In 1636, he was stripped of his title by the Chongzhen Emperor and put under house arrest in Fengyang. His former title was transferred to his younger brother Zhu Yumo (). In 1641, the latter committed suicide when Li Zicheng invaded Nanyang. After the death of the Chongzhen Emperor 1644, his successor on the Ming throne, the Hongguang Emperor, released the Prince of Tang from his arrest. As emperor When Qing forces captured Nanjing in June 1645, he fled to Hangzhou. In August of the same year, at the behest of several high officials, he ascended to the Ming throne in Fuzhou, taking the reign title Longwu (ÈöÜÊ≠¶; pinyin: L√≥ngw«î). His era name means \\"Plentiful and martial\\". After a promising start, Fujian's geographical position on the margin of the empire, cut off from the heartland by several mountain ranges, as well as his lack of effective troops and the failure on part of the officialdom to find a united stance doomed the Longwu government. When Qing forces invaded Fujian in the late summer of 1646, Zheng Zhilong, the emperor's strongest ally, surrendered while his son Zheng Chenggong (the famous Koxinga) retreated to the sea. The Prince of Tang was left with a dwindling court. On 6 October 1646, he was captured and immediately executed. Personality Against the Ming policy of keeping imperial princes out of politics, the Prince of Tang early on showed interest in the government of the empire and strove for a larger role of the princes in it. His initiatives had brought him under house arrest during the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor, but his knowledge of history and of Ming institutions, paired with a diligent personality, made him take his imperial role seriously.. Zhu Yujian is said to have had a very close relationship with his wife, who had shared his hardship when he was incarcerated. Contrary to Chinese custom, he steadfastly declined to take any concubines.

It opened in 1996 In 2007, the Antioch Unified School District named Scott Bergerhouse and Clarence Isadore co-principals. The co-principal model has previously been implemented in some larger schools in southern California. In February 2010, Deer Valley and the rest of the AUSD schools were informed that they would issue a uniform policy in the second semester of the 2010-2011 school year. This policy proved to be a failure for the school, partly due to the policy taking effect halfway through the year. The policy was discontinued by its second month. School Site Council The Deer Valley School Site Council is a group of parents, teachers, students and other school employees elected by their peers to meet with the school co-principals in order to: * Develop a comprehensive school site plan * Plan, monitor, and review its effectiveness * Develop a budget aligned to categorical program funds * Review and revise the plan and budget annually * Recommend Single Plan for Student Achievement to the School Board * Recommend the plan for targeting use of other categorical or supplemental funds to the School Board * Ensure that the school is continually engaged in identifying and implementing curriculum and instructional practices Academics The school is divided into four \\"houses\\", each of which has its own vice-principal and secretary. At the freshman and sophomore levels Deer Valley uses a teaming concept, where groups of students share the same English, math, science, and history teacher. In addition to core classes, a wide variety of elective classes are offered to students. In addition to instrumental and choral music, foreign language, drama, automotive, culinary, and art classes, students may also enroll in electives including video production, digital art, web design, animation, law, manufacturing, photography, and careers with children. Deer Valley also houses academies: Antioch Unified School District has four Linked Learning academies in place throughout the district. There are four academies on the campus of Deer Valley High School, a Law Academy, a Performing Arts Academy, a Business Academy, and an ACE Academy. The process for attending an academy begins in the second half of the eighth grade, when students and their parents have opportunities to attend presentations by each of the Learning Link academies. Students can apply for one or more by completing an application. The selection is by lottery; it is open to all district students without pre-testing; however, there is a 3.0 GPA requirement. Located in House 2 of DVHS, the Law Academy curriculum includes three elements: law-related content embedded in required courses in English, social studies, math and science, law-specific elective courses such as Constitutional Law and Criminal Justice, and work- based learning throughout the four years of study. Students enrolled in the Deer Valley Law Academy must take a fundamental criminal justice class in 9th grade, with the curriculum continuing on to the next year, and psychology in 11th grade. Deer Valley is also one of the few high schools in California with the option to take Philosophy; the Law students are placed as top priority in the enrollment process. DVHS Planetarium Deer Valley High School is one of the few high schools in the Bay Area to have a planetarium. The planetarium has been in operation since 2004 and hosts biweekly shows for the community. It is open to the public. The current shows start at 8 pm and has star observing at 9 pm on alternating Thursdays when school is in session.

The shots were fired from a vehicle, which then drove off. The victim was lifted by air to John Muir Medical Center and underwent surgery. The school, along with all other schools in the district, then went into lockdown later that morning. 19-year- old Yousuf Mohammad Aziz and another person were arrested in connection with the shooting. In 2011, Aziz was convicted of charges of premeditated attempted murder, assault with a firearm, shooting at an inhabited dwelling and two counts of street terrorism, and was sentenced to 7 years to life in prison. 2013 bomb threats In April 2013, the school received continuous bomb threats in a single week, with evacuations held on an hourly basis due to safety concerns. These bomb threats were also sent out to Black Diamond Middle School as well, with these types of threats deemed \\"anonymous\\". It was later revealed that a 16 year old student was responsible for the bomb threats, and was arrested soon after. No one was hurt during those evacuation periods. 2020 shooting On January 31, 2020, at around 8:30pm, a fight broke out in the parking lot of the school. A sixteen year old student, Jonathan Parker, was shot three times during a basketball game against cross-town rival Antioch High School. The teen later died from his injuries.

The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and broadcasts at 6,000 watts ERP from the a tower in the Town of Kingston, New York, while its studios are in Beacon. The WBPM calls were previously on 94.3 MHz from 1975 to 2003, that station is today known as WKXP. History 92.9 MHz, Saugerties, New York was added to the FCC's Table of Allotments in June 1998. The allotment was applied for and won by then- WRNQ/WKIP/WTND owner Eric Straus. In its preparation to reach the air, its tower site changed from WDST's original tower in Lake Katrine to a defunct AT&T; microwave relay tower site in the Town of Kingson, given that a feasibility study showed that from the former very little signal would reach the main target market of Poughkeepsie. On September 15, 1999, the allotment was assigned the call letters WRKW, signed on for testing that October 23, and made a full launch on November 1, 1999. WRKW's launch format was a \\"Rock Adult Contemporary\\" format called Quality Rock which was automated and jockless outside of the syndicated Bob & Tom morning show. Later a voicetracked PM drive jock and the syndicated weekend show The Beatle Years was added. Considering that the same music was available on the far stronger WPDH, the station struggled to make a showing. After Clear Channel Communications purchased Straus' stations in 2000, the format remained unchanged until 2002 due to contractual obligations to the firm that programmed the Quality Rock format. On June 26, 2002, at 10 AM, the station entered a 26-hour-long stunt of Eminem's \\"Without Me.\\" The next day at Noon, WRKW relaunched as active rock 92.9 Rock. Unlike its predecessor, the station launched with DJ's taken from sister stations and a heavy promotion blitz and quickly became a middle-of-the pack radio station. In March 2003, the syndicated Waking with the Wolf show began airing on the station. \\"The Wolf\\" had been on WPDH for several years before moving to WPYX in Albany, New York. This show did not live up to the station's expectations and was canceled 14 months later when the station changed formats again. On May 26, 2004, WRKW changed format to oldies as Cool 92.9 and soon thereafter took the WBPM calls which had served nearly three decades on 94.3 FM and with air staff formerly of that station and oldies predecessor WCZX. In late May 2006, it was announced that WBPM and sister station WGHQ would be swapped to Pamal Broadcasting along with Clear Channel's Rutland, Vermont cluster (WSYB, WZRT) and WPYR in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for WRNX in Amherst, Massachusetts. The deal made WBPM a sister station to market leaders WSPK and WHUD as well as WBNR and WLNA. Programming When Pamal took control of the station on February 1, 2007, the station changed to \\"Classic Hits\\" at 12:00 p.m. that day after twelve hours of stunting. The programming featured \\"Classic Rock-leaning hits from 1965-1989.\\" Currently, the station is programmed by Randy Turner, formerly of WCZX. In October 2011 Bob Miller joined WBPM as Morning Show host (after a long stint at rival WCZX) reuniting with longtime co-host and newsman Brian Jones. As of September 1, 2012, under the direction of station manager Don Verity, WBPM features Classic Pop Hits marketed as \\"The Biggest Hits of All Time\\" from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

The Spanish essentially wiped out the native Ta√≠no people through slavery and smallpox, to which the Ta√≠no had no immunity. An early defender of more humane treatment of the Ta√≠no was the Spanish priest Bartolom√© de Las Casas. Albeit too late to save the Ta√≠no, Las Casas was able to persuade the Spanish government that the Ta√≠no could not withstand such cruel treatment. This had the tragic side effect of the importation of African slaves to replace the labor of the diminishing Ta√≠no. Initially, Las Casas believed Africans to be suitable for slavery, but he later came to oppose their enslavement too. \\"I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery...and I was not sure that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God,\\" Las Casas wrote in The History of the Indies in 1527. In 1697, Spain formally ceded to France control of the part of the island of Hispaniola that would become Haiti, naming it Saint-Domingue. Slavery in Saint-Domingue, France's most lucrative colony, was known to be especially brutal, with a complete turnover of the slave population due to death every 20 years. According to the historian Laurent Dubois, between 5 and 10 percent of slaves died every year due to overwork and disease, a rate that outpaced births. The dead were replaced by new slaves from Africa. In 1791, what would become known as the Haitian Revolution began. Predominantly a slave revolt, Haitians finally won their freedom and independence from France in 1804. In 1825, France's King Charles X threatened to invade Haiti unless it paid an \\"independence debt\\" of 150 million francs to reimburse France for the loss of its slaves and land. The debt was later reduced to 90 million francs but it was not until 1947 that Haiti had paid off what many have regarded as an immoral and illegal debt. To pay this, Haiti had to borrow money from and pay interest to French banks. \\"We're talking about 200 hundred years of this cycle of debt that Haiti has gone through, which of course has devastating consequences on the capacity of the state within the country,\\" Haiti historian Laurent Dubois has said. The country's poverty made it vulnerable throughout its history to political instability and human rights abuses both by Haitian state officials and foreign interventions. In 1915, following a coup that led to the mob killing of Haitian President Vibrun Guillaume Sam, United States sailors and marines landed in order to protect U.S. interests in the country. The occupation would last until 1934. \\"Following restoration of order, a treaty providing for United States control over Haitian finances, customs, police, public works, sanitation, and medical services were concluded with the client Haitian government,\\" according to the Navy Department Library. During the occupation roads and other public works projects were built by the corv√©e labour‚Äîforced, unpaid work‚Äîof Haitian peasants. In 1916, the U.S. military started a Haitian army that would later become the Garde d'Haiti. Beginning with the Caco Wars, during the US occupation, and continuing until the 1990s, the Haitian army was implicated in a number of human rights abuses against the Haitian people. For example, following a 1991 coup by the military that overthrew democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian army was accused of killing an estimated 3,000 people in three years. Upon his return to the presidency, Aristide disbanded the army. Survivors of the 2018 Lasalin massacre https://www.pambazuka.org/human-security/lasalin-massacre-and-human- rights-crisis-haiti allege that the PHTK, ruling political Party headed by Jovenel Mo√Øse, were responsible for the orchestrated attack and mass murder of civilians. Schools and other community buildings were also targeted. U.S.A. Government involvement in Haiti is on-going. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/failing-haiti-and-forgetting- jean-bertrand-aristide Duvalier period In 1957, Fran√ßois Duvalier, also known as \\"Papa Doc\\", became president of Haiti, ushering in a period of human rights abuses from which the country is still recovering. An estimated 30,000‚Äì60,000 people were killed in the 30 years Haiti was under the rule of Duvalier and his son‚Äîand successor‚ÄîJean-Claude Duvalier, also known as \\"Baby Doc\\". In 1959, Fran√ßois Duvalier formed a paramilitary force known as the Tonton Macoute, named after a mythic Haitian character who kidnapped misbehaving children, carried them off in a bag and ate them for breakfast. Duvalier authorized more than 10,000 Tonton Macoute, organized in 500 sections across the country, to maintain complete control over the population. \\"The macoutes were Papa Doc's version of brownshirts and the Waffen SS, except that their usual uniform was blue jeans, T-shirts, sunglasses, and they carried clubs or pistols,\\" wrote journalist and author Herbert Gold in Best Nightmare on Earth: A Life in Haiti. \\"They were loyal only to Papa Doc. In return, they could rob, steal, extort, torture and murder at will.\\" The Tonton Macoute continued to openly terrorise the population until they were officially disbanded after Jean-Claude Duvalier was forced from the presidency and went into exile in 1986. Law and order The government in Haiti is known for running a slow, inefficient and corrupt system of justice. Allegations of torture and kidnapping are common whereas the number of Haitian citizens imprisoned without trial is huge. Lawyers' immunity is under constant threat. Under the Duvalier regime, lawyers were intimidated from defending their clients through pressure and violence. Courts of justice were in effect \\"run by the judges, appointed by the \\"President for Life\\" (the Duvaliers), who lacked the independence to make judgments about abuses against human rights.\\"\\"Entry on 'Haiti' \\", p.652, Encyclopedia of Human Rights, by Edward H. Lawson, Mary Lou Bertucci, Laurie S. Wiseberg. 2nd Edition (revised), Taylor and Francis, 1996, , . To this day, there is still no guarantee for lawyers' immunity in Haiti, as would seem to be suggested by the 2009 unconstitutional arrest without warrant of human-rights defender, Osner Fevry\\"L'avocat Osner F√©vry, incarc√©r√© sur ordre du chef du Parquet\\", Radio Metropole, 23 May 2009. Retrieved 12 June 2009. and the arrest in 2013 of Andre Michel, a lawyer critical of the government. Prolonged pretrial detention Although the Constitution mandates an independent judiciary and the right to a fair trial, prolonged pretrial detention remains a serious problem. Because the court system and its records are poorly organized, it is impossible to determine the exact percentage of prisoners being held without trial. A study by the International Centre for Prison Studies, in partnership with the University of Essex, estimated that in 2013 nearly 71 percent of 9,921 prisoners in Haiti had not had a trial yet. According to the Centre, the majority of countries in the world have percentages ranging between 10 and 40 percent of such prisoners and Haiti's estimated 71 percent is one of the highest in the world. Freedom of expression The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the press, and the government generally has respected these rights. Many journalists, however, practice a measure of self-censorship in order to protect themselves from retribution. During the second Aristide administration (2000‚Äì4), some reports contend that members of the press were killed for supporting opposition movements. The government does not censor radio, television, or the Internet. Because demonstrations often turn violent, security forces frequently have ignored the constitutionally mandated right to assembly and organization. The Haitian government generally has respected religious freedom in the country. Gender, disability, race and language Haiti's Constitution does not contain specific language prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, language, age, or disability. Although some working standards exist to protect women, few resources exist to ensure enforcement. Abuses against women and children are common. Rape, although illegal, rarely results in prosecution of the perpetrator. Haitian law (article 269) excuses a husband for murdering his wife if the wife is found in an adulterous affair. Wives do not enjoy the same right.\\"Frequently Asked Questions About 'Honour Killing' \\", Violence is not our culture. Retrieved 15 July 2014. The Haitian government contains a Ministry of Women's Affairs, but it also lacks the resources to address issues such as violence against women and harassment in the workplace. Children In addition to suffering from chronic malnourishment and a lack of educational opportunity, many Haitian children also suffer physical abuse. In 2004 the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs reported that its hotline received more than 700 calls from children reporting abuse. Few statistics regarding the wider problem of child abuse have been collected. Trafficking of children also is a significant problem. UNICEF estimates that 2,000 to 3,000 Haitian children per year are trafficked to the Dominican Republic.

One of the great county bowlers, he took more first- class wickets ‚Äì 2,218 ‚Äì than any other player who never played Test cricket. Career Shepherd began his county career in 1950 as a fast-medium bowler, and was a regular in the Glamorgan team in 1952, when he took 120 wickets. Over the next three seasons, however, he was less successful and appeared to lose some control. Under advice from team-mates, he switched late in 1955 to bowling off-cutters - off-breaks with a pronounced undercut delivered at almost medium pace. The move was an instant success. In 1956, Shepherd took 177 wickets, more than any other player in that English first-class season, and he took more than 100 wickets in 12 seasons in all. On bad wickets, he could be devastating; on good wickets, his accuracy and the speed of delivery meant that he was usually economical. Shepherd maintained his fitness into his mid-forties, and was an integral part of the Glamorgan side that won the County Championship in 1969. He was rewarded by being named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1970, and he celebrated that accolade by taking more wickets, 106, in the 1970 season than any other player in the English first- class game. His tally from a career spanning 23 summers (1950‚Äì72) included 28 instances of ten or more in a match and 123 of five or more in an innings. In a batting side that included some real rabbits - Jeff Jones, Ossie Wheatley - Shepherd batted perhaps higher up the order than he might have in other teams. He averaged less than 10 runs per innings and reached 50 just five times. He could play big shots however and, in 1961, he scored 51 in 15 minutes against the Australians at Swansea, reaching that score with just 11 scoring strokes, six sixes, three fours, a two and a single. Also in 1961, against Derbyshire at Cardiff, he made his top score of 73, hitting six sixes in reaching his 50 in 16 minutes.Wisden 1962, p. 401. He took nine wickets when Glamorgan beat the 1964 Australians at Swansea, and captained Glamorgan to victory against the 1968 Australians, again at Swansea. Later life Shepherd played regularly to the end of the 1971 season, and then retired from first-class cricket after a few games in 1972. He often appeared as a summariser on BBC Radio Wales coverage of Glamorgan matches. He died on 18 August 2017, soon after his 90th birthday.Don Shepherd: Glamorgan great dies aged 90, BBC Sport.

In 954, he married Beatrice, daughter of Hugh the Great, count of Paris, and Hedwige of Saxony. He received in dowry the revenues of the abbey of Saint-Denis in Lorraine. To stop incursions from the duchy of Champagne, Frederick constructed a castle over the Ornain river in 960, and later occupied confiscated lands of Saint-Mihiel. He exchanged fiefs with the bishop of Toul. Thus, he created his own feudal domain, the county of Bar. So he became the founder of the House of Bar or the House of Ardennes-Bar, a cadet branch of the House of Ardennes. The duchy of Lorraine was at that time governed by the archbishop of Cologne, Bruno, who was called the archduke on account of his dual title. In 959, Bruno, in concert with his brother, the Emperor Otto I, divided the duchy, appointing as margraves: Godfrey in Lower Lorraine and Frederick in Upper Lorraine.

It is accessible via bus from Villaz√≥n to the south (and thereby both Argentina and Tarija) and Potos√≠ to the north, as well as via the north-south train which served the mining settlements and runs the same route. From Tupiza, various towns in the local mining districts are accessible, as is the Salar de Uyuni. Legend has it that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid met their end at the hands of the Bolivian army near Tupiza, concluding their notorious string of bank robbery raids. Various local outfitters provide horseback or jeep tours to the rumored site.

Riberalta is on the south (south east) bank of the Beni River. As the capital of the province of Vaca Diez, the city has maintained its charm even after the Brazilian nut trade sparked recent development. Bolivia is the dominant producer of the nuts, in the period 2017/2018, the country accounted for 78% of production. Peru producers 16% while Brazil produces a mere 2%.World Atlas City life in Riberalta MunicipalityMunicipalities of Bolivia at www.editorialox.com is punctuated by nature thanks to its location on the banks of the Beni and Madre de Dios rivers and its proximity to the Amazon rainforest. The city is also called the Bolivian capital of the Amazon. The town population is 99,070 in 2018. It is also home to Bolivian Navy flotilla and 1st Naval District.  History  Riberalta was originally inhabited by the Ch√°cobo and Pacahuara natives who called it ‚ÄúPamahuay√°‚Äù, which means ‚Äúplace of the fruits‚Äù. Bolivian Anthropologist Wigberto Rivero determined that the area was once populated by indigenous groups of the Pano family; which belong to the native Pacahuara, Chacobos, Caripunas, Sinabos and Perintintin. These same people lived for thousands of years resisting attacks from the Incan Empire and western settlers. Riberalta‚Äôs current name comes from the union of two words in Spanish: ‚Äúribera alta‚Äù (‚Äúhigh bank‚Äù in English.) The city was founded on February 3, 1894 with approximately 2,500 inhabitants established in a red canyon in Northern Bolivia. It is also known as the city of four names: Barranca Colorada (Red Canyon), La Cruz (The Cross), Ribera-Alta (High Bank), and Riberalta. Starting in the middle of the 19th century, solo explorers and navigators of the Bolivian Northwest penetrated the solitary jungle; They founded barracks more than thirty meters high, erected and blessed by the convergence of two colossal rivers, which turned the municipality into the economic center of the north of the country. On October 8, 1880, Don Edwin Heath named the city Barranca Colorada. A few years later Frederico Bodo Claussen, manager of House Braillard de Reyes, was informed of the barracks and sent a German subject with resources to install a commercial factory there. Afterwards, it received the name La Cruz on May 3, 1884 when Don Maximo Henicke surveyed a small home built two years earlier in 1882 by Placido Mendez. A little over a year later, on July 7 of 1885, Bodo Claussen baptized the city under the name Ribera-Alta, which later was combined into Riberalta. Nine years later, on February 3 of 1894, Riberalta was founded with an official act under the name Villa Riberalta, after having already existed for twelve years. It was founded by a National Delegate of the Colonies, Lysimachus Guti√©rrez, who did so under the orders of President Mariano Baptista and in honor of the birth of the Mcal. Antonio Jose de Sucre.

It was released by Walt Disney Pictures. This was the last Benji movie to star Benjean, daughter of Higgins, in the title role. Plot In Oregon, Benji has gone missing while filming a movie on location. Benji‚Äôs trainer, Frank Inn, tells a television reporter named Mary Beth McLaulin that he and Benji had been on an open fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean when a storm came in, capsizing the vessel. Inn fears Benji is dead, but the movie producers plan to search the wilderness coastline with a helicopter. The next day, Benji lies in the brush near the shoreline when the helicopter flies overhead, but he goes unnoticed. Benji wanders through the woods and comes across a female cougar perched atop a boulder. Just then, a hunter shoots the cougar. Benji tries to comfort the dying animal, but the hunter chases him away and carries the dead cougar away. When the helicopter flies overhead again, Benji runs after it, barking to no avail. Benji subsequently encounters four orphaned cougar cubs, belonging to the killed cougar, and he attempts to shield them from predation. While hunting, Benji comes face to face with a rabbit, but licks it twice, and leaves. Benji finds a cabin where a quail is being cooked over an open fire. When the hunter takes the cooked bird inside, Benji spies two additional dead quails hanging on a line nearby. He grabs one of the birds and drags its body back to the den for the cubs. The next day, a fawn runs by and two ferrets play in a nearby creek while Benji collects rocks to make the den higher so the cubs cannot get out. Benji returns to the cabin to get the other dead quail, but the hunter catches him and ties him up. Reading Benji's collar, the hunter remembers there is a reward for the dog's rescue. When the hunter goes inside, Benji tugs at the rope, trying to break free. Just then, a wolf growls at Benji. When the hunter comes outside, the wolf runs away. As Benji paces the area as far as the rope will allow, the wolf comes back and Benji makes a commotion. The hunter comes outside to see about the noise, scaring the wolf away. The hunter briefly unties Benji while trying to unravel his rope. Benji grabs the other dead quail in his mouth and runs back to the cubs. Benji sees an adult female cougar with a single cub and barks, but she attacks him. Benji then moves the cubs to a new location, carrying each of them individually in his mouth. While doing this, the helicopter flies overhead and Benji sees his trainer in the window. By the time Benji has finished moving the cubs to the new den, another animal has eaten the quail. Benji searches for more food, barking at the cubs when they try to follow him. Meanwhile, the wolf begins to move in on the cubs, but the helicopter flies overhead, scaring him away. The next day, Benji sees the cougar and the wolf nearby. The wolf begins to chase Benji, but the dog manages to elude him. Later, the four cubs follow Benji along the path. A large bear comes into the clearing. Benji and the cubs hide, but one of the cubs runs toward the bear, hissing at him. The bear growls, scaring the cub back to the hiding place. When the bear moves toward them, Benji barks and runs the opposite direction. The bear gives chase, but soon loses interest. However, the wolf appears again and chases Benji. They run a long distance over the mountain until Benji leads the wolf to the bear in order to get rid of him. Later, the cougar drinks from the stream when one of the cubs approaches. Just then, the helicopter flies overhead, scaring the cougar and her cub away. When Benji spots the cougar again, he barks at the cubs to follow him across the stream. The helicopter lands nearby and Frank Inn gets out, calling for Benji. The dog looks between his master and the cubs playing and decides that he should help the cubs before he could reunite with his owner. Unaware Benji is nearby, Inn gets back into the helicopter and flies away. Later, an eagle swoops down, grabs one of the cubs in its talons and flies off. When the eagle later flies near the three remaining cubs, Benji barks to scare it away in time. Benji spots the cougar and her cub following closely behind her. Benji barks at her repeatedly until she gives chase, but Benji loses her along the way. Although Benji almost falls into the deep ravine, he climbs to safety. From the top of the cliff, Benji sees the cubs below. Benji finds the cougar near the waterfall. Benji runs to get the cubs, but finds the wolf watching the cubs. Benji barks at the wolf, then bites at him. The cubs hide under a rock where the wolf cannot reach them. Benji jumps on the wolf‚Äôs back, then runs away. As the wolf gives chase, Benji tricks the wolf by hiding in the bushes that shields the cliff behind it and sends the wolf falling off the cliff to his death. Benji lures the cubs to come out from under the rock and carries one of the cubs up the side of the steep mountain in his mouth. At the top, Benji leaves the first cub, then goes back down the cliff to get the others. With all three cubs on the mountaintop, the mother appears. She sniffs the cubs and nuzzles them. The mother's cub sees its adopted siblings and runs to join them. The cougar lies down and the four cubs nurse from their adoptive mother. Benji goes to rest in plain sight in the meadow just as the helicopter approaches.

Dag Ivar Wir√©n (15 October 1905 ‚Äì 19 April 1986) was a Swedish composer. Life Wir√©n was born at Striberg near Nora. His father had a roller blind factory, and there were various musical activities in the family home; he took piano lessons, and was a student at the Karolinska school in √ñrebro, and played the bass drum and celesta in the town orchestra. Dag Wir√©n Foundation website - biography. Wir√©n studied at the Stockholm conservatory from 1926 to 1931, which gave him much exposure to music from all periods; hearing Arthur Honegger's oratorio King David in 1927 was an important experience. In 1932 he won the state stipend and used the award money to continue his studies in Paris, where he lived from 1931 to 1934. While there, he studied composition under the Russian composer Leonid Sabaneyev, though he admitted later that his endless attendance of concerts, and not his tutoring with Sabaneyev, had the greater impact on his own work. In Paris he met Igor Stravinsky (as well as his compatriot G√∂sta Nystroem) and was exposed to the music of Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev and the French composers of Les Six.Cnattingius CM.

In 1934, Wir√©n moved to Stockholm with his bride, the Irish cellist, Noel Franks, whom he had met in Paris; their daughter, Annika, was born in 1947. In 1937, the couple set up home permanently in Danderyd, just north of Stockholm. As well as composing, Wir√©n regularly played his main instrument, the piano, on Swedish Radio during the 1930s; he also devoted himself to chamber music in the 1930s and 40s; although he conducted in a recording of his Sinfonietta, he hated conducting.√Öhl√©n C.

He was music critic at the \\"Svenska Morgonbladet\\" from 1938 to 1946, and in 1947 became vice-chairman of the Society of Swedish Composers.Brandel √Ö. A Mature Generation: Larsson, Wir√©n, de Frumerie, Koch. In: Sweden in music. Musikrevy International, Stockholm, 1960. From 1948, he spent summers on the island of Bj√∂rk√∂, in Stockholm's archipelago. He served as a member of the board of directors of the Royal Swedish Opera from 1962 to 1971. His TV ballet Den elaka drottningen (The Evil Queen) won the 1960 Prix Italia. He also wrote the music for the Swedish entry for the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest, Annorst√§des vals (Absent Friend), sung by Ingvar Wixell. He retired from composing in 1970, commenting, \\"One should stop in time, while one still has time to stop in time.\\" He died at Danderyd on 19 April 1986. Music Wir√©n's output, which ranges from serious to popular, is notable for its quality rather than quantity, and a number of his works were refused opus numbers or withdrawn. He once commented that his first desire was to entertain and please, and compose listener-friendly 'modern' music. He was reluctant to write for the voice (in the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest entry, Alf Henrikson wrote the lyrics after Wir√©n had composed the music). Neoclassical pieces from Wir√©n's early Parisian period, including the Piano Trio (1933) and the Sinfonietta (1933‚Äì34), are melodically and rhythmically entertaining. Upon his return to Sweden, he composed his first two symphonies and his most famous work, the Serenade for Strings (1937); the spirit of this serenade may also be found in the finale of his second symphony (1939). Wir√©n went on to compose five symphonies, concertos and other orchestral works, including music for the stage and film scores, as well as instrumental and chamber music, including a series of string quartets. His musical style on return from Paris remained broadly neoclassical; melodic, energetic and with high spirits. Towards the mid-1940s Wir√©n became more serious in style, perhaps under the influence of Jean Sibelius. Wir√©n also developed a personal technique, first used in the third string quartet (1941‚Äì45), of gradual motivic transformation, avoiding repetition (metamorphosis technique). He pursued this approach in his third symphony (1944), where the first motif in the first movement, based on a step- wise Dorian mode progression, is transformed during the movement and then echoed in the last three movements. Motivic tautness also characterizes the deeply expressive fourth symphony (1952), as well as his rather cooler later works, including the fifth symphony (1964) and fifth string quartet (1970).

In addition to the ventral hypothalamus, the tuber cinereum includes the median eminence and pituitary gland. Together with the hollow itself, it is sometimes referred to as the pituitary stalk.  Structure  The tuber cinereum is an inferior distention of the floor of the third ventricle; the conical hollow formed by the distention (a continuation of the ventricle itself), is known as the infundibulum (funnel). Thus, the tuber cinereum is anteriorly continuous with the lamina terminalis, while laterally it is continuous with the anterior perforated substances of the hypothalamus. The inferior end adjoins the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Capillaries of the tuber cinereum are specialized and confluent to enable rapid communication via brain- or blood-borne factors between compartments of the tuber, a capillary system described as the hypophyseal portal system. The subregion of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus closest to the median eminence contains specialized permeable capillaries surrounded by wide pericapillary spaces, enabling moment-to-moment sensing of circulating blood.  Function  The tuber cinereum primarily constitutes nerve fibres travelling from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. Rather than providing signalling to the gland, many of these fibres actually function as the source of the substances released by the posterior lobe of this gland. Hence, the tuber cinereum functions as a rapid, high-concentration, hormonal route between the hypothalamus, median eminence, and pituitary gland, and from there into the general circulation.

The Constitution of Pakistan provides for fundamental rights. The Clauses also provide for an independent Supreme Court, separation of executive and judiciary, an independent judiciary, independent Human Rights commission and freedom of movement within the country and abroad. However these clauses are not respected in practice. Khawaja Nazimuddin, the 2nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, stated: \\"I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be\\". However, this in stark contradiction to what Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, stated in an address to the constituent assembly of Pakistan, \\"You will find that in course of time Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as the citizens of the State.\\" Though the Constitution includes adequate accommodation for Pakistan's religious minorities, in practice non-Sunni Muslims tend to face religious discrimination in both the public and private spheres (for example ‚Äì non Muslims cannot hold any of the top positions in the country's government). In response to rising sectarian and religious violence, the Pakistani government has unveiled several high-profile efforts to reduce tension and support religious pluralism, giving new authority to the National Commission for Minorities and creating a Minister for Minority Affairs post. Nonetheless, religious violence and intimidation, as well as periodic charges of blasphemy, have occurred. Attacks against Shia Muslims, who make up between 5‚Äì20% of Pakistani Muslims, have also been carried out by terrorist organizations such as the TTP and LeJ. However, in recent years, the Pakistani military and law enforcement agencies have conducted vast and extensive operations against these terrorist organizations which has resulted in a dramatic decrease in violence against minorities and restoration of relative peace. Furthermore, Pakistani courts have taken action against the misuse of blasphemy laws,in one case sentencing multiple people to life in prison and death for starting a blasphemy mob. Pakistani lawmakers have also taken action against the misuse of blasphemy laws, putting forward amendments that seek to equate punishments for a false accusation of blasphemy to the punishment for actually committing blasphemy. Although Pakistan was created to uphold the principles of democracy, military coups in Pakistan are commonplace, and for most of its history after independence has been ruled by military dictators who declare themselves president. The 2013 Pakistani general election were the first elections in the country where there was a constitutional transfer of power from one civilian government to another. Elections in Pakistan although being partially free, are rife with irregularities including but not limited to vote rigging, use of threats and coercion, discrimination between Muslim and non- Muslim and many other violations. Additionally the Government of Pakistan has itself admitted on several occasions that it has absolutely no control over the Military of Pakistan and related security agencies. Domestic violence is an important social issue in Pakistan, specially because of allegations that the Pakistani government has not done enough to stem the problem from the country. An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled. The majority of victims of violence used to have no legal recourse but this was fixed recently when multiple provincial parliaments passed thorough and strict laws against domestic violence. According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 2,134,900 people are enslaved in modern-day Pakistan, or 1.13% of the population. In 2019, a woman journalist was allegedly murdered by her husband - who was also a journalist - because she refused to quit her job. Urool Iqbal had been living alone at the time of her murder and had only recently filed a complaint against her husband with the police. The Coalition For Women In Journalism founding director Kiran Nazish said: ‚ÄúThis case crystalizes the multi-layered dangers women journalists face in many countries, Pakistan being one of them. After speaking to those who were close to Urooj, it is very clear that her job as a journalist was a problem for her partner, who is accused in the fatal shooting that killed the young journalist.\\" In general Freedom of the press is allowed but any reports critical of the government policy or critical of the military is censored. Journalists face widespread threats and violence making Pakistan one of the worst countries to be a journalist in, with 61 being killed since September 2001 and at least 6 murdered in 2013 alone. TV stations and news papers are routinely shut down for publishing any reports critical of the government or the military. In May 2012, President Asif Ali Zardari signed the National Commission for Human Rights Bill 2012 for the promotion of the protection of human rights in the country.President Zardari signs bill to establish human rights commission , The News International, May 31, 2012 However, it remains to be seen if any positive effects will be derived from this. In May 2018, a new constitutional amendment was passed that allowed tribal people to access their rights. The amendment allowed the people in tribal areas to enjoy the same constitutional rights as other Pakistanis. The constitutional amendment ended the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR), imposed under British rule in the 1850s. Under the FCR, people in the tribal areas were explicitly denied their right to appeal their detention, the right to legal representation, and their right to present evidence in their defence ‚Äì sanctioning a wide-ranging series of human rights violations. Political Freedom in Pakistan Although Pakistan was created to uphold the principles of democracy, its history is rife with Military coups in Pakistan, and for most of its history after independence has been ruled by military dictators who declare themselves president. The 2013 Pakistani general election were the first elections in the country where there was a constitutional transfer of power from one civilian government to another. The elections were marred by terrorist attacks that killed hundreds and wounded more than 500 and widespread rigging of polls, the highest in the country's recorded history. Religious minorities were prevented from voting for Muslim candidates after Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization and non-Muslims are restricted in the posts they may contest for, with several of the higher posts being unavailable to them. Although some of these laws were later repealed, religious minorities still continue to face several restrictions in politics. Although slow but steady progress has been made towards return to democracy in the last decade, many Pakistanis and foreign observers see the military still firmly entrenched in politics with the government playing second fiddle to the military. The government is widely seen as having no control over the armed forces and the Inter-Services Intelligence. Most of Pakistan's laws are secular in nature, some of which were inherited from the United Kingdom's colonial rule of modern-day Pakistan before 1947. However, in practice, Sharia Law takes precedence over Pakistani law. The Constitution of Pakistan provides for fundamental rights which include freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of religion, freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and the (conditional) right to bear arms. It has been changed several times in its short history, with Islamization being the driving factor. Although the government has enacted a few measures to counter any problems, abuses remain. Furthermore, courts suffer from lack of funds, outside intervention, and deep case backlogs that lead to long trial delays and lengthy pretrial detentions. Many observers inside and outside Pakistan contend that Pakistan's legal code is largely concerned with crime, national security, and domestic tranquility and less with the protection of individual rights. In 2010, Foreign Policy ranked Pakistan as number ten on its Failed States Index, placing it in the \\"critical\\" category with such other failed or failing states as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Somalia. Pakistan consistently figures near the top of the list of failed states year after year. In September 2015, a Pakistani court has imposed ban on speeches of Mr. Altaf Hussain, chief of MQM which is the 4th largest political party of Pakistan and represents mainly Mohajir community. The court directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) and Additional Attorney-General Naseer Ahmed Bhutta to implement a ban on the broadcast of images and speeches of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) chief Altaf Hussain across all electronic and print media till further orders. Freedom of the press in Pakistan In general freedom of the press is allowed but any reports critical of the government policy or critical of the military are censored. Journalists face widespread threats and violence, making Pakistan one of the worst countries to be a journalist in, with 61 being killed since September 2001 and at least 6 murdered in 2013 alone. Freedom House rated Pakistan as \\"Not Free\\" in its report of 2013 and gave it a score of 64 (on a scale of 0‚Äì100, with 0 being most free and 100 being least free). The report brought to light widespread intimidation of journalists by various government, military and security agencies with killings allegedly being carried out by the Inter-Services Intelligence. Reporters Without Borders has ranked Pakistan number 158 out of 180 countries listed in its Press Freedom Index of 2014. In 2013 veteran journalist Hamid Mir, a recipient of the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, Pakistan's second-highest civil award, was shot at by unidentified assailants wounding him with bullets thrice. He alleged that the Inter-Services Intelligence was behind the attack. His TV channel Geo Tv was shut down by the government for 15 days for airing reports that the ISI may have carried out the attacks. Websites such as YouTube and many others were in the past blocked by the government for violating blasphemy laws. Websites which are deemed to criticize the government or the military, websites which expose human rights violations of minorities, and websites which are perceived as blasphemous are all regularly blocked. Censorships In Pakistan Though Print Media & TV Channels in Pakistan had usually been reeling under the curbs imposed by the Military Rulers, but this year, a new era of curbs on media in Pakistan has ushered in. Even though there is no military rule or internal emergency or a grave situation like civil unrest, but the Prime Minister Imran Khan's Govt. has imposed restrictions on a wide array of broadcasting & publication of news that do not taste good to the Civil Govt. under PM Imran Khan or parallel Military Govt. being run by Army Chief Bajwa. Ban on Airing Ads of International Brands With Indian Stars Strict restriction on airing Indian TV Channels in Pakistan is not new. In the beginning of the New Year 2019, Supreme Court of Pakistan had declined the request of PEMRA to air ads of global big brands containing Indian content on the ground that they would damage Pak culture. In April 2019, Chairman of PEMRA once again threatened cable operators against severe actions against the cable operators airing Indian Channels. ¬ß(Pakistan Today) Provincial inequality Miscarriage of Justice Security forces routinely violate the human rights in the course of counter terrorism operations in Balochistan and elsewhere. Suspects are frequently detained without charge and or convicted without a fair trial. Thousands of people rounded up as suspected terrorists continue to languish in illegal military detention without being produced in court or being prosecuted. The army continues to deny independent monitors, lawyers, relatives or humanitarian agencies access to the prisoners. The 1997 Anti- Terrorism Act, which established Anti Terrorism Court, and subsequent anti- terrorist legislation, has arisen concerns about protection of fundamental rights. Muslim groups have persecuted non-Muslims and used some laws as the legal basis for doing so. The Blasphemy law, for example, allows life imprisonment or the death penalty for contravening Islamic principles, but legislation was passed in October 2004 to attempt to counter misuse of the law. Provisions of the Islamic Qisas and Diyat laws allow the murder victim's nearest relative or Wali (ŸàŸÑŸä) (legal guardian) to, if the court approves, take the life of the killer or to agree to financial compensation paid to the heirs of the victim.victim.http://thelawstudy.blogspot.com/2014/09/fully- explain-diyat-and-its-value.html Pakistan's military intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and the law enforcement have been accused of arresting and kidnapping political leaders who have demanded more autonomy or freedom from Pakistan. They have also been accused of arresting student activists and teachers protesting the exploitation of Pakistani government. Many human-rights activists in Pakistan have protested against force disappearances and kidnappings.  Women's rights  Women in Rawalpindi queuing to vote in Pakistan's 2013 elections. The social status of women in Pakistan is one of systemic gender subordination even though it varies considerably across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide due to uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of tribal, feudal, and capitalist social formations on women's lives. The Pakistani women of today do, however, enjoy a better status than in the past. Pakistan has a dual system of civil and sharia law. The Constitution of Pakistan recognizes equality between men and women (Art. 25(2) states \\"There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex\\") but also recognizes as valid Sharia law (Chapter 3A. ‚Äì Federal Shariat Court). Violence against women Domestic violence in Pakistan is an endemic social problem. According to a study carried out in 2009 by Human Rights Watch, it is estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of women and girls in Pakistan have suffered some form of abuse. An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled. The majority of victims of violence have no legal recourse. Law enforcement authorities do not view domestic violence as a crime and usually refuse to register any cases brought to them. Given the very few women's shelters in the country, victims have limited ability to escape from violent situations. Human Rights Watch said in its report released in 2014 that \\"Violence against women and girls ‚Äì including rape, Honor killings, Acid attacks, Domestic violence and Forced marriage all remain serious problems in Pakistan. Despite high levels of domestic violence, the parliament has failed to enact laws to prevent it and protect women.\\" In 2002 women's rights activists Saba and Gulalai Ismail founded Aware Girls, a grassroots women's rights initiative to empower women and girls against domestic and terrorist violence based in Peshawar. More recently Saba Ismail has represented women's rights at the United Nations. Rape in Pakistan came to international attention after the politically sanctioned rape of Mukhtaran Bibi. The group War Against Rape (WAR) has documented the severity of rape in Pakistan, and the police indifference to it. According to Women's Studies professor Shahla Haeri, rape in Pakistan is \\"often institutionalized and has the tacit and at times the explicit approval of the state\\". According to a study carried out by Human Rights Watch there is a rape once every two hours and a gang rape every hour. According to lawyer Asma Jahangir, who is a co-founder of the women's rights group Women's Action Forum, up to seventy-two percent of women in custody in Pakistan are physically or sexually abused. There have been several thousand \\"honor\\" killings in Pakistan in the past decade, with hundreds reported in 2013. An Amnesty International report noted \\"the failure of the authorities to prevent these killings by investigating and punishing the perpetrators.\\" Honour killings are supposed to be prosecuted as ordinary murder, but in practice, police and prosecutors often ignore it. Women's eNews reported 4,000 women attacked by Bride burning in Islamabad's surroundings over an eight-year period and that the average age range of victims is between 18 and 35 with an estimated 30 percent being pregnant at the time death. Shahnaz Bukhari has said of such attacks > Either Pakistan is home to possessed stoves which burn only young > housewives, and are particularly fond of genitalia, or looking at the > frequency with which these incidences occur there is a grim pattern that > these women are victims of deliberate murder According to the Progressive Women's Association such attacks are a growing problem and in 1994 on International Women's Day announced that various NGO's would join to raise awareness of the issue. Notable attacks against women *On 9 October 2012, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for attempting to assassinate 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai. They vowed to continue to target her for promoting education for women and girls. In response, a new law was signed by the President on 20 December, guaranteeing free and compulsory education to boys and girls between the ages of five and 16. *On 4 July 2012, women's human rights activist Fareeda Kokikhel Afridi was killed in a drive-by shooting as she left her home in Peshawar for work in the Khyber Tribal Agency. Local civil society groups said she had been targeted for promoting the human rights of women. The authorities failed to bring the perpetrators to justice. *In 2007, Kainat Soomro a 13-year-old was kidnapped at gunpoint and gang raped. Her family faced widespread condemnation for refusing to \\"honor\\" kill their daughter and faced several attacks which resulted in the death of her brother. Her rapists were all acquitted and she was put under trial for premarital sex which is a crime under Islamic law. *On June 2002, Mukhtaran Bibi was gang raped on the orders of a tribal council and paraded naked in front of a cheering crowd of 300 people. She did not commit suicide, as is customary in gang rape incidents in Pakistan, but instead attempted to seek justice. Nearly a decade after the incident 5 of the 6 accused of gang raping her were acquitted while the sixth faces life in prison. She continues to face widespread discrimination in Pakistan and has been subject to house arrest, illegal detention and harassment from the government and law enforcement agencies. Political abuse of human rights Provincial and local governments have arrested journalists and closed newspapers that report on matters perceived as socially offensive or critical of the government or military. Journalists also have been victims of violence and intimidation by various groups and individuals. In spite of these difficulties, the press publishes freely on other matters, although journalists often exercise self-restraint in their writing to avoid inuring the wrath of the government or military. In 2001, citizens participated in general elections, but those elections were criticized as deeply flawed by domestic and international observers. Societal actors also are responsible for human rights abuses. Violence by drug lords and sectarian militias claims numerous innocent lives, discrimination and violence against women are widespread, human trafficking is problematic, and debt slavery and bonded labor persist. The government often ignores abuses against children and religious minorities, and some government institutions and Muslim groups have persecuted non-Muslims and used some laws as the legal basis for doing so. The Blasphemy law, for example, allows life imprisonment or the death penalty for contravening Islamic principles, but legislation was passed in October 2004 to attempt to counter misuse of the law. Furthermore, the social acceptance of many these problems hinders their eradication. One prominent example is honor killings (‚Äúkaro kari‚Äù), which are believed to have accounted for more than 4,000 deaths from 1998 to 2003. Many view this practice as indicative of a feudal mentality and falsely anathema to Islam, but others defend the practice as a means of punishing violators of cultural norms and view attempts to stop it to as an assault on cultural heritage. Pakistan was recommended by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in May to be designated as a ‚ÄúCountry of Particular Concern‚Äù (CPC) by the Department of State because of its government's engagement or toleration of systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.  Humanitarian response to conflict  Violence in Pakistan and the Taliban conflict with the government have heightened humanitarian problems in Pakistan.Sara Pantuliano (2009) Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action Overseas Development Institute Political and military interests have been prioritized over humanitarian considerations in the offensives against the Taliban, and issues are likely to get worse as people are encouraged back home prematurely and often face once again being victims of the Taliban terrorists. Displacement is a key problem and humanitarian organizations are failing to address the basic needs of people outside displacement camps, nor are they able to address issues such as the conduct of hostilities and the politicization of the emergency response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute argue that aid agencies face dilemmas with engaging with the government, as this does not always produce the desired results and can conflict with their aim of promoting stability and maintaining a principled approach. A principled approach limits their ability to operate when the government emphasizes political and security considerations.  Internally displaced people  There were over 500,000 people displaced in 2008 mainly from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on the border with Afghanistan, and a further 1.4 million from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in May 2009. By mid-July 2009, Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) put the total of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) at just over 2m, while unofficial figures are as high as 3.5m. Most of those displaced (up to 80%) were taken in by relatives, friends and even strangers ‚Äì Pashtun communities in particular have displayed great efforts in assisting the displaced despite their own high levels of poverty. Still others use schools, but only a small minority live in approximately 30 official camps, mainly in the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. There is little support for those living outside of camps, official support consists only of some food and non-food items and government cash grants. Many of those who have been taken in are looked after by political and religious groups providing assistance in return for membership or support. The government has been struggling to provide support to an area traditionally marginalized and remote and is also keen to downplay the scale of the crisis. Before military operations are undertaken, little preparation is made for the predictable increase in displaced peoples in order to avoid attracting the attention of opposing forces. There are also suggestions that help given to IDPs is informed by cultural and political expediency, as in the case of a $300 family cash grant. The international community's assistance is marginal in comparison to local efforts due to the rate and scale of displacement; the scattering of displaced populations among host families and in spontaneous settlements; access difficulties due to insecurity and the role of the military in the relief effort. International humanitarian organizations have focused on camp-based populations and this limited interaction has hampered their attempts to analyze the full complexity of the situation, the context, its different actors and their interests ‚Äì all of which are key to ensuring that the humanitarian imperative is achieved in this complex operating environment. The cluster method often used for the coordination and funding of humanitarian responses to IDPs have been criticized many agencies have bypassed the UN cluster, such as OFDA and DfID. However, operational agencies also indicated that donors have also been slow to challenge government policy due to their overall support to the Pakistani counter-insurgency effort, as well as lack of influence. The government has come under criticism also for downplaying the crisis, but also for weakening the position of the UN though the ‚ÄòOne UN Approach‚Äô in Pakistan, leaving a UN unable to function properly. Furthermore, in an effort to force refugees back to the areas they have fled (in order to create a sense of normalcy), the government has cut off power and water supply to the IDP camps.  \\"Friends of Pakistan\\"  Many donors see the conflict as an opportunity for more comprehensive engagement in an effort to promote stability in the region, to promote a legitimate government and curtail transnational threats. The ‚ÄòFriends of Pakistan‚Äô group, which includes the US, the UK and the UN, is key in the international community's drive to promote stability. The US has adopted a joint ‚ÄòAf-Pak‚Äô (Afghanistan and Pakistan) strategy in order to suppress the insurgency and defend its national security interests. This strategy seeks engagement with the government and the military intelligence communities, develop civilian and democratic governance, for instance through the provision of services and support in ‚Äòcleared areas‚Äô in FATA and Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa, and increasing assistance including direct budget support, development aid and support with counter-insurgency work. The UK equally sees an opportunity to counter instability and militancy through a combined military and 'hearts and minds' approach, through judicial, governance and security sector reform. The UNDP/WFP takes a similar line. Yet the success of this approach is by no means clear, as both the government and society at large are not welcoming of foreign interference. USAID takes into account political as well as humanitarian dimensions in its decision making process. Many civilians see little distinction between aid agencies, the military operations and \\"western interests\\"; ‚Äòyou bomb our villages and then build hospitals‚Äô. Many humanitarian organisations thus avoid being too visible and do not mark their aid with their logos. Discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities Pakistan is known for widespread discrimination against religious minorities, with attacks against Christians, Hindus, Ahmadiyya, Shia, Sufi and Sikh communities being widespread. These attacks are usually blamed on religious extremists but certain laws in the Pakistan Criminal Code and government inaction have only caused these attacks to surge higher. Sunni militant groups operate with impunity across Pakistan, as law enforcement officials either turn a blind eye or appear helpless to prevent widespread attacks against religious minorities. Ethnic killing of Punjabis in Balochistan The Punjabis who are local settlers in Pakistan's Balochistan province as well as outsiders who come for work in the province are seen as collaborators of the Pakistan Government and Pakistan Army and are targeted by Baloch Separatists such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front.  Extrajudicial killings of Pashtuns  The Pashtun Protection Movement has accused the Pakistan Army of \\"a campaign of intimidation that includes extrajudicial killings and thousands of disappearances and detentions.\\" The killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud has brought forth accusations that Pashtuns are racially profiled. Military operations in Pakistan's tribal areas have caused the dispersal of Pashtuns away from their homes. Pashtuns who have advocated for human rights for their ethnic group have been attacked and murdered. Founder of Aware Girls, Gulalai Ismail, was threatened with death by the Inter-Services Intelligence after she joined the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement and protested against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings by the Pakistani state. After raising awareness of sexual assault committed by Pakistani security forces on women, Gulalai Ismail fled the country as police forces were on their way to arrest her.  Silencing of human rights abuses in Balochistan  As of 2018, the Pakistani state was using Islamist militants to crush Balochi separatists. Academics and journalists in the United States have been approached by Inter-Services Intelligence spies, who threatened them not to speak about the insurgency in Balochistan, as well as human rights abuses by the Pakistani Army or else their family would be harmed. Human rights violations of Ahmadi Several minority Muslim communities, such as the Ahmadiyya have been attacked in pogroms in Pakistan over the years. The human rights violation of the Ahmadiyya have been systematic and state-sponsored. General Zia, the military dictator of Pakistan, went many steps further in 1984, when to gain the support of Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan, he promulgated the anti- Ahmadiyya Ordinance XX that added Sections 298-B and 298-C in Pakistan Criminal Code. > 298-B. Misuse of epithets, descriptions and titles, etc., reserved for > certain holy personages or places: (1) Any person of the Qadiani group or > the Lahori group who call themselves 'Ahmadis' or by any other name who by > words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation- (a) refers to > or addresses, any person, other than a Caliph or companion of the Holy > Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as \\"Ameer-ul-Mumineen\\", \\"Khalifatul- > Mumineen\\", Khalifa-tul-Muslimeen\\", \\"Sahaabi\\" or \\"Razi Allah Anho\\"; (b) > refers to, or addresses, any person, other than a wife of the Holy Prophet > Muhammad (peace be upon him), as \\"Ummul-Mumineen\\"; (c) refers to, or > addresses, any person, other than a member of the family \\"Ahle-bait\\" of the > Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as \\"Ahle-bait\\"; or (d) refers to, > or names, or calls, his place of worship a \\"Masjid\\"; shall be punished with > imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three > years, and shall also be liable to fine. (2) Any person of the Qadiani group > or Lahori group (who call themselves \\"Ahmadis\\" or by any other name) who by > words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation refers to the > mode or form of call to prayers followed by his faith as \\"Azan\\", or recites > Azan as used by the Muslims, shall be punished with imprisonment of either > description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be > liable to fine. > 298-C. Person of Qadiani group, etc., calling himself a Muslim or preaching > or propagating his faith: Any person of the Qadiani group or the Lahori > group (who call themselves 'Ahmadis' or by any other name), who directly or > indirectly, poses himself as a Muslim, or calls, or refers to, his faith as > Islam, or preaches or propagates his faith, or invites others to accept his > faith, by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representations, or > in any manner whatsoever outrages the religious feelings of Muslims shall be > punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend > to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Through this ordinance, Ahmadi Muslims were deprived of most of their basic human rights and their freedom of faith. Under the provisions of this ordinance, an Ahmadi Muslim could be given rigorous imprisonment of 3 years and fined any amount. An Ahmadi can be easily charged for profession of his faith or for ‚Äòposing‚Äô as a Muslim. The ordinance was a green signal for anti- Ahmadiyya elements to open the floodgates of tyranny with the help of the State. The ordinance provides a ready and convenient tool in the hands of fundamentalists and the government to incriminate Ahmadis on flimsy grounds and petty excuses. Controversial blasphemy laws Anti-Pakistani blasphemy law protest in Bradford, England (2014). In Pakistan, 1.5% of the population are Christian. Pakistani law mandates that any \\"blasphemies\\" of the Quran are to be met with punishment. On July 28, 1994, Amnesty International urged Pakistan's Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto to change the law because it was being used to terrorize religious minorities. She tried, but was unsuccessful. However, she modified the laws to make them more moderate. Her changes were reversed by the Nawaz Sharif administration which was backed by religious political parties. Here is a list of some notable incidents involving blasphemy accusations: * Ayub Masih, a Christian, was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death in 1998. He was accused by a neighbor of stating that he supported British writer, Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses. Lower appeals courts upheld the conviction. However, before the Pakistan Supreme Court, his lawyer was able to prove that the accuser had used the conviction to force Masih's family off their land and then acquired control of the property. Masih has been released. * On October 28, 2001 in Lahore, Pakistan, Islamic militants killed 15 Christians at a church. *On September 25, 2002 two terrorists entered the \\"Peace and Justice Institute\\", Karachi, where they separated Muslims from the Christians, and then executed eight Christians by shooting them in the head. * In 2001, Pervaiz Masih, Head Master of a Christian High School in Sialkot was arrested on false blasphemy charges by the owner of another school in the vicinity. * On September 25, 2002, unidentified gunmen shot dead seven people at a Christian charity in Karachi's central business district. They entered the third-floor offices of the Institute for Peace and Justice (IPJ) and shot their victims in the head. All of the victims were Pakistani Christians. Karachi police chief Tariq Jamil said the victims had their hands tied and their mouths had been covered with tape. Pakistani Christians have alleged that they have \\"become increasingly victimised since the launch of the US-led international war on terror.\\" * In November 2005, 3,000 militant Islamists attacked Christians in Sangla Hill in Pakistan and destroyed Roman Catholic, Salvation Army and United Presbyterian churches. The attack was over allegations of violation of blasphemy laws by a Pakistani Christian named Yousaf Masih. The attacks were widely condemned by some political parties in Pakistan. However, Pakistani Christians have expressed disappointment that they have not received justice. Samson Dilawar, a parish priest in Sangla Hill, has said that the police have not committed to trial any of the people who were arrested for committing the assaults, and that the Pakistani government did not inform the Christian community that a judicial inquiry was underway by a local judge. He continued to say that Muslim clerics \\"make hateful speeches about Christians\\" and \\"continue insulting Christians and our faith\\". * In February 2006, churches and Christian schools were targeted in protests over the publications of the Jyllands-Posten cartoons in Denmark, leaving two elderly women injured and many homes and properties destroyed. Some of the mobs were stopped by police.International Christian Response: Cartoon Protestors in Pakistan Target Christians * In August 2006, a church and Christian homes were attacked in a village outside of Lahore, Pakistan in a land dispute. Three Christians were seriously injured and one missing after some 35 Muslims burned buildings, desecrated Bibles and attacked Christians. * On September 22, 2006, a Pakistani Christian named Shahid Masih was arrested and jailed for allegedly violating Islamic \\"blasphemy laws\\" in Pakistan. He is presently held in confinement and has expressed fear of reprisals by Islamic Fundamentalists. * On August 1, 2009, nearly 40 houses and a church in Gojra were torched on the suspicion that Quran had been burnt there. While police watched, 8 victims were burned alive, 4 of them women, one aged 7. Eighteen more were injured. * In 2010, a Pakistani Christian woman named Aasiya Noreen (also known as Asia Bibi) was sentenced to death for blasphemy after an incident occurred with co- workers while picking berries. The verdict received worldwide attention, including petitions for her release. Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti and Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer were both assassinated for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws. In October 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan acquitted her based on insufficient evidence. Noreen's defense lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook fled to the Netherlands in November 2018, fearing for his life. Noreen finally fled to Canada in May 2019, after overcoming several more legal hurdles following her acquittal, including a petition to appeal the Supreme Court's acquittal decision. * In 2012 a young Christian woman, Rimsha Masih, was arrested on blasphemy charge, but released after a few weeks in high security lock-up as a result of international outrage. * On March 9, 2013, two days after Sawan Masih, a Christian, was accused of blasphemy. A mob of two thousand Muslims torched over 200 homes and two churches. Masih was sentenced to death the following year. * In April 2014 a Christian couple from Gojra, Shafqat Emmanuel and Shagufta Kausar, received death sentences. * On May 7, 2014 Rashid Rahman, a lawyer representing a university professor Junaid Hafeez accused of blaspehmy was murdered in the Pakistani city of Multan. In response the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and some other civil organizations protested in front of the Karachi Press Club in the city of Karachi. Based, in part, on such incidents, Pakistan was recommended by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in May 2006 to be designated as a \\"Country of Particular Concern\\" (CPC) by the Department of State. Intolerance against Hindus and other minorities As of April 2012, Pakistan did not provide a legal system for registration of marriages for certain minorities including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Bah√° º√≠. Denial of recognition of Hindu marriages is often used to intimidate and harass Hindus. Married Hindu women have been forcibly kidnapped and married to Muslims, and are left without legal recourse due to inability to prove their previous marriage. It also makes it difficult for Hindus to obtain the Computerized National Identity Card. The increasing Islamization has caused many Hindus to leave Hinduism and seek emancipation by converting to other faiths such as Buddhism and Christianity. Such Islamization include the blasphemy laws, which make it dangerous for religious minorities to express themselves freely and engage freely in religious and cultural activities. Minority members of the Pakistan National Assembly have alleged that Hindus were being hounded and humiliated to force them to leave Pakistan. Hindu women have been known to be victims of kidnapping and forced conversion to Islam. Krishan Bheel, one of a handful of Hindu members of the National Assembly of Pakistan, came into news recently for manhandling Qari Gul Rehman, who had repeatedly provoked him by making declaratory statements against his religion. Hindus in what is now Pakistan have declined from 23% of the total population in 1947 to 1.5% today. The report condemns Pakistan for systematic state- sponsored religious discrimination against Hindus through bigoted \\"anti- blasphemy\\" laws. It documents numerous reports of millions of Hindus being held as \\"bonded laborers\\" in slavery-like conditions in rural Pakistan, something repeatedly ignored by the Pakistani government. Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985‚Äîa policy originally proposed by Islamist leader Abul A'la Maududi. Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county's political process, but the policy had strong support from Islamists. In the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition Pakistani Hindus faced riots. Mobs attacked five Hindu temples in Karachi and set fire to 25 temples in towns across the province of Sindh. Shops owned by Hindus were also attacked in Sukkur.Hindu homes and temples were also attacked in Quetta. In 2005, 32 Hindus were killed by firing from the government side near Nawab Akbar Bugti's residence during bloody clashes between Bugti tribesmen and paramilitary forces in Balochistan. The firing left the Hindu residential locality near Bugti's residence badly hit. The rise of Taliban insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities in Pakistan, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and other minorities. It is said that there is persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan. In July 2010, around 60 members of the minority Hindu community in Karachi were attacked and evicted from their homes following an incident of a Dalit Hindu youth drinking water from a tap near an Islamic Mosque. In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down. Pakistan's Supreme Court has sought a report from the government on its efforts to ensure access for the minority Hindu community to temples ‚Äì the Karachi bench of the apex court was hearing applications against the alleged denial of access to the members of the minority community. Since March 2005, 209 people have been killed and 560 injured in 29 different terrorist attacks targeting shrines devoted to Sufi saints in Pakistan, according to data compiled by the Center for Islamic Research Collaboration and Learning (CIRCLe).a think-tank based in Rawalpindi At least as of 2010, the attacks have increased each year. The attacks are generally attributed to banned militant organizations of Deobandi or Ahl-e-Hadith (Salafi) backgrounds.Sunni Ittehad Council: Sunni Barelvi activism against Deobandi-Wahhabi terrorism in Pakistan ‚Äì by Aarish U. Khancriticalppp.comLet Us Build Pakistan (Primarily Deobandi background according to another source‚Äîauthor John R. Schmidt).John R. Schmidt states, \\"although most Deobandis are no more prone to violence than their Christian fundamentalist counterparts in the West, every jihadist group based in Pakistan save one is Deobandi, as are the Afghan Taliban\\". The Unraveling: Pakistan in the Age of Jihad John R. Schmidt2011 Pakistan's citizens have had serious Shia-Sunni discord. An estimated 75‚Äì95% of Pakistan's Muslim population is Sunni, while an estimated 5‚Äì20% is Shia, but this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country,Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival (Norton), 2006, p.160 larger than the Shia majority in Iraq. Although relations between Shia and Sunni were once cordial, some see a precursor of Pakistani Shia‚ÄìSunni strife in the April 1979 execution of deposed President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on questionable charges by Islamic fundamentalist General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who subsequently took over as dictator of Pakistan. Zia ul-Haq was a Sunni.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.89 Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as \\"Sunnification\\" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni fiqh. In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the Islamization laws in the capital Islamabad. Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.161-2 Zia-ul-Haq pursued anti-Shia policies and attacks on Shias also increased under Zia's presidency, with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to Lahore and Balochistan. Sectarian violence became a recurring feature of the Muharram month every year, with sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias taking place in 1986 in Parachinar. In one notorious incident, the 1988 Gilgit Massacre, Osama bin Laden-led Sunni tribals assaulted, massacred and raped Shia civilians in Gilgit after being inducted by the Pakistan Army to quell a Shia uprising in Gilgit. From 1987‚Äì2007, \\"as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died in sectarian fighting in Pakistan\\", 300 being killed in 2006. With thousands more being killed since then as the violence has only gotten much worse. In 2013 alone more than 400 Shia have been killed in targeted attacks that took place across Pakistan. Amongst the culprits blamed for the killing are Al-Qaeda working \\"with local sectarian groups\\" to kill what they perceive as Shia apostates, and \\"foreign powers ... trying to sow discord.\\" Outside funding for these Sunni Militia comes mostly from Saudi Arabia and other gulf states which have a predominantly Sunni population and leadership. Most violence takes place in the largest province of Punjab and the country's commercial and financial capital, Karachi. There have also been conflagrations in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Azad Kashmir. In the 33rd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, India raised the issue of persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan. India said, \\"religious and sectarian minorities such as Hindus, Christians, Shias, Ahmaddiyas, Ismailis and others continue to face discrimination, persecution and targeted attacks in Pakistan. Places of worship belonging to minorities have been destroyed and vandalized. Blasphemy laws remain in force and are disproportionately used against religious minorities.\\" Due to religious persecution in Pakistan, Hindus continue to flee to India. Most of them tend to settle in the state of Rajasthan in India. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan data, just around 1,000 Hindu families fled to India in 2013. In May 2014, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year.  Dargah pir sarhandi, a frequent crime scene of forced conversion and marriage of kidnapped underage Hindu girls. In Pakistan, Hindu and Christian girls are kidnapped, raped, forcibly converted to Islam and married to Muslim men. These girls are generally 12 to 18 years old. According to the Aurat Foundation,about 1,000 non-Muslim girls are forcibly converted to Islam in Pakistan every year. Forced and coerced conversions of religious minorities to Islam occurred at the hands of societal actors. Religious minorities claimed that government actions to stem the problem were inadequate. Several human rights groups have highlighted the increased phenomenon of Hindu girls, particularly in Karachi, being kidnapped from their families and forced to convert to Islam. The Human Rights groups have reported that the cases of forced conversion are increasing. A 2014 report says about 1,000 Christian and Hindu women in Pakistan are forcibly converted to Islam every year. In 2003 a six-year-old Sikh girl was kidnapped by a member of the Afridi tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; he also claimed the girl had converted to Islam and therefore could not be returned to her family. Since the turn of the century non-Sunni minorities as the Kalash and Ismailis have been threatened with conversion to Islam or death by the Taliban and other radical Islamic groups. Well known Pakistani sportsperson-politician Imran Khan (now the Prime minister) had condemned the forced conversions threat as un-Islamic. On October 12, 2012, Ryan Stanton, a Christian boy of 16, went into hiding after being accused of blasphemy and after his home was ransacked by a crowd. Stanton stated that he had been framed because he had rebuffed pressures to convert to Islam. Rinkle Kumari, a 19-year Pakistani student, Lata Kumari, and Asha Kumari, a Hindu working in a beauty parlor, were allegedly forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam. They told the judge that they wanted to go with their parents. Their cases were appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The appeal was admitted but remained unheard ever after. In 2020, a 15-year-old Hindu girl was kidnapped, forcibly converted and married to a Muslim man. She was later rescued by the police. The Court ordered her to be sent to a Women's protection centre. Others have been less fortunate with one bride actually being abducted with the help of the police.

Plot In Athens, Greece, a secret agent named Stelios goes to an outdoor caf√© where the waiter gives him newspapers and a package. The newspapers reveal that a German scientist is missing in Greece and the package contains a photo of the dog Benji with his family. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Benji‚Äôs family arrives at an airport, on their way to the island of Crete in Greece. The children, Paul and Cindy, worry about their dogs, Benji and Tiffany, as they are placed in travel carriers. Cindy tells the airline representative that Tiffany has a ‚Äúcondition.‚Äù While waiting to check- in, Mary learns that the man behind her in line, Chandler Dietrich, is also headed to Crete. Dietrich then sneaks into the employee-only luggage area, snatches Benji‚Äôs carrier off a conveyor belt, drugs the dog, and imprints a code on his paw. Upon arrival in Crete, Dietrich befriends Mary, while the family learns that Benji and Tiffany missed the connecting flight from Athens. Stelios lurks in the background, watching. At the Athens airport, Benji and Tiffany are in their carriers, stored in a luggage room. When a worker inadvertently lets Benji escape, he and a British couple, Ronald and Elizabeth, chase the dog through the airport and across a runway, but Benji flees into the city. As he wanders the streets of Athens, Benji mistakes another family for his own. After several near collisions with cars, Benji retreats into ancient ruins. There, he sees a stray dog gnawing a bone. The other dog will not share his food, so Benji returns to the city streets. In a marketplace, Benji steals a string of sausages, and returns to the ruins to share them with the stray dog, thus making a new friend. The next day, Benji returns to the marketplace, but the police capture him. Ronald and Elizabeth, claim the dog and take him to their home. Hearing a knock at the door and Ronald takes Benji upstairs as Elizabeth stalls their visitor, Stelios, who poses as a representative of Olympic Airways, and sends Stelios away. Soon, Mary comes to the house in search of Benji and the dog hears her voice from upstairs. As she leaves, Benji barks at Mary from the window, but a passing truck drowns out the sound. So Benji climbs outside, slides down an awning and chases her taxi. Meanwhile, Dietrich pursues Benji in a sports car, but loses him. Alone again, Benji wanders to a hotel, where he spots Mary, Paul, and Cindy, but runs away when he sees Dietrich. Procuring a Doberman, Dietrich tracks Benji to the ruins. Sometime later, in the city, a butcher feeds Benji in his shop. Benji takes a nap, but is awakened by the Doberman barking. When Dietrich enters the shop, Benji springs from a cupboard and escapes. After spending the night in the ruins, Benji stakes out his family‚Äôs hotel, but he is chased away by the doorman. Returning to the butcher‚Äôs shop, Benji sees his friend talking to Stelios, but before Benji can get their attention, Dietrich grabs the dog at gunpoint. However, Stelios and the butcher release the Doberman, whom Dietrich tied up outside the shop, and Stelios follows the Doberman to find Dietrich and Benji. As the Doberman leaps at Dietrich, Benji escapes once more. The Doberman chases Benji to the ruins, but the stray dog chases him away. Benji then returns to the hotel, sneaks inside on a luggage cart, and reunites with his family. However, Stelios arrives to announce that he has to take Benji away for a few days. Before Stelios can explain, Dietrich hits the man over the head with a gun, knocking him out. Dietrich then tells the family that he is a U.S. agent who must take Benji because the dog holds the key to important information. Instructing Mary to call the police and hold Stelios at gunpoint, Dietrich leaves with Benji. Stelios awakens and tells Mary that Dietrich is an impostor. The real Dietrich was found murdered in New Jersey and that this man is impersonating him for his own gain. Stelios explains he is a real secret agent, not Dietrich, and he has orders to save the life of a top scientist and to preserve a project of worldwide significance. Mary is reluctant to believe him, though. Meanwhile, the man pretending to be Dietrich takes Benji to a yacht, where Ronald and Elizabeth are waiting. When the couple accuses the impostor of trying to double-cross them, he knocks them unconscious. As Benji escapes, the impostor Dietrich pursues the dog back to the hotel, which is now surrounded by police. Seeing that the impostor is holding Cindy at gunpoint in the car, Benji rushes at the man, knocks the gun to the ground, and rescues Cindy, as the police arrest the impostor. Sometime later, Paul and Cindy play with Benji on a beach. Stelios explains to Mary that the impostor Dietrich used Benji to smuggle the coordinates for a meeting with a German scientist, who had created a formula for turning one barrel of oil into ten or twelve. The charlatan aimed to steal the formula and sell it to highest bidder. Benji proudly looks upon a basket of puppies, the result of Tiffany‚Äôs ‚Äúcondition.‚Äù Cast * Benjean as Benji * Patsy Garrett as Mary * Cynthia Smith as Cindy Chapman * Allen Fiuzat as Paul Chapman * Tiffany as White Dog * Ed Nelson as Chandler Dietrich * Peter Bowles as Ronald * Art Vasil as Stelios * Bridget Armstrong as Elizabeth Reception Film critic Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times finds the movie to be the adventures of Benji in Athens.

Under Paraguayan law, freedom of speech and of the press are technically guaranteed. The news media are independent and theoretically free to criticize the government, although political officials often sue the media for libel in order to put an end to undesirable investigations. Journalists are also frequently ‚Äúsubjected to harassment, intimidation, and violence ‚Äì primarily from drug trafficking gangs and criminal syndicates based in departments bordering Brazil ‚Äì due to their reporting.‚Äù The government does not limit Internet access or academic freedom; freedom of assembly is restricted, with demonstrations allowed only at certain times and places. Paraguayans may move freely around the country, travel or move abroad, and move back to Paraguay. The country has accepted political refugees, mostly from Cuba. Elections are free and fair, although unregistered parties and independent candidates are not allowed to take part in national and departmental elections Women's rights Rape and domestic violence are major problems in Paraguay. Rape is punishable by up to 10 years, but police are often hesitant to make arrests. Domestic violence must be ‚Äúhabitual‚Äù to be considered criminal. Domestic-violence charges were often withdrawn owing to family pressure. Women technically enjoy equal rights but sexual discrimination, especially in employment and pay, is common and traditional. Paraguayan law requires that in party primaries at least 20 percent of the candidates in each party must be women. There are women serving at most levels of government. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on Paraguay in 2011 to conduct ‚Äúawareness-raising and public educational campaigns...with a view to bring about changes in traditional attitudes associated with discriminatory gender roles in the family and in society at large.‚Äù It also suggested that the media and advertisers adopt a ‚Äúcode of conduct‚Äù with the goal of avoiding sexual stereotypes and preventing gender discrimination. The committee also called for more vigorous prosecution of perpetrators of violence against women and intensified efforts to raise awareness throughout Paraguay of the inappropriateness of such activity. It also urged Paraguay to set quotas to ensure increased participation by women in politics and diplomacy. The UN Human Rights Committee called on Paraguay in 2006 to ‚Äúensure that legislation protecting against gender discrimination is enforced and that the institutions created for that purpose are adequately financed for effective operation.‚Äù It also asked Paraguay ‚Äúto ensure equal working conditions for men and women and to increase participation by women in all areas of public and private life.‚Äù As for Paraguay's ‚Äúrestrictive abortion laws,‚Äù the committee asked Paraguay to ‚Äútake effective action to reduce infant and maternal mortality by, inter alia, revising its legislation on abortion ...and ensuring that contraceptives are available to the general public, especially in rural areas.‚Äù Migrants' rights The Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families recommended in 2012 that Paraguay ‚Äústrengthen its institutional structure for dealing with migration-related issues‚Äù and ‚Äúestablish a coordination mechanism with a view to improving services for migrant workers and their families while, at the same time, working to ensure its compliance with and the uniformity of regional and international treaties to which Paraguay is party.‚Äù The committee also urged Paraguay to take more serious steps to combat human trafficking Indigenous people's rights Paraguay is a signatory of Convention 169 Indigenous and Tribal People's Convention of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The rights of indigenous people are supposed to be safeguarded by the National Institute of the Indigenous (INDI), the Public Ministry, and the Ombudsman's Office. Nonetheless, discrimination against indigenous persons is widespread, and such persons' rights, especially their property rights, are often violated by authorities. Although indigenous people are permitted to serve in government, moreover, there are no such persons in any higher-level government position. As Amnesty International put it in a 2012 report, there is ‚Äúwide international recognition of the fact that Indigenous Peoples in Paraguay suffer serious and systematic violation of their rights.‚Äù The Committee on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the ILO, the UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Peoples, and the Inter-American Commission and Court have all expressed concern about the land rights of indigenous people in Paraguay; such groups as Tierraviva, CODEHUPY, the Catholic Bishops‚Äô Conference and the Coordinator for the Self-Determination of Indigenous Peoples (Coordinadora por la Autodeterminaci√≥n de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas, CAPI) have criticized indigenous people's displacement from their tribal lands. Also, the National Federation of Workers (Confederaci√≥n Nacional de Trabajadores, CNT) has criticized the failure to consult indigenous persons on laws affecting their rights. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on Paraguay in 2012 to protect indigenous people's rights, especially land claims. In the same year, Amnesty International suggested that ‚Äúapproving and implementing anti-discrimination legislation that adheres to international human rights standards would play an important role in promoting Indigenous Peoples‚Äô rights and in requiring concrete actions to uphold them.‚Äù Children's rights Paraguayan nationality is acquired by being born in Paraguay, or to citizens temporarily living abroad, or government employees serving abroad. A 2010 report by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child complained that many children in Paraguay, however, are unregistered. Child abuse and neglect are widespread, as is child labor. The U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor reported 5 goods produced under such working conditions in Paraguay. These included the production of bricks, the quarrying of stone, the production of cotton and sugarcane as well as pornography. The National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate the Exploitation of Children, the Secretariat for Children and Adolescents (SNNA), and the Integral Adolescent Attention Service seek to protect children and adolescents from abuse. There are hostels, shelters, and children's homes and orphanages around the country. A major problem is the sexual exploitation of children, many of whom work as prostitutes. Adults who pimp out child prostitutes are punishable by up to eight years. For opposite-sex statutory rape, the maximum penalty is a fine; for same-sex statutory rape, a prison sentence. These laws are not vigorously enforced, however. The UN Human Rights Committee called on Paraguay in 2006 ‚Äúto ensure respect for children‚Äôs rights, including urgent steps to eradicate child labour.‚Äù An extensive 2010 report by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child made a series of urgent proposals regarding the human rights of children in Paraguay, including calls for major improvement in official approaches to the abuse, sexual exploitation, and trafficking of children, in the prevention of child labour, and in children's access to health care, education, and proper nutrition. Paraguay is a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Rights of persons with disabilities Technically it is illegal in Paraguay to discriminate against disabled people, but discrimination is widespread, and there is no law requiring buildings or transport to be wheelchair accessible. For this reason most disabled children are unable to attend school. A law requires 5 percent of government jobs to be filled by disabled persons, but in practice fewer than one percent of such jobs are held by persons with disabilities. LGBT rights Officially, discrimination against gays is illegal, though discrimination is widespread, and government officials often ignore the law in practice. LGBT groups operate freely, and the government issues permits and provides security for gay-pride marches. Even though the state provides security for gay-pride marches and gatherings recently these marches and gatherings have led to clashes between the police and the paraders that have accused the government of discriminating them after some homophobic statements made by Colorado and UNACE congressmen. Employee rights Paraguayan law allows unions, strikes, and collective bargaining, and forbids binding arbitration. In practice, however, employers act with impunity against strikers and unions. The law also prohibits forced labor, but in practice it is widespread. Labor by children under 14 is illegal, but it is actually widespread, As of 2010, slightly over half of Paraguayan children between ages five and 17 are in employment, with the majority of them working over 14 hours a week. There are known to be slaves in Paraguay, especially among domestic servants; parents sell children to perform forced labor, smuggle drugs, and commit other crimes. Enforcement of laws against these activities is hampered by a lack of resources. There is a minimum wage, but it is unenforced. There is also a standard workweek, but violations abound. Institutionalized corruption Police officers are frequently involved in crime. Paraguayan police have been described in a 2010 U.S. State Department report as ‚Äúpoorly trained, inadequately funded, generally corrupt, and shielded by impunity.‚Äù Policemen commit kidnappings, detain civilians in order to extort bribes, and conspire with prosecutors to commit blackmail and other crimes. The report refers to ‚Äúroutine incidents of police involvement in homicide, arms and narcotics trafficking, car theft, robbery, extortion, and kidnapping throughout the country, with such abuses particularly widespread in Ciudad del Este and other areas bordering Brazil.‚Äù Between 2008 and 2010, several police officers were arrested for or found guilty of various acts of murder and manslaughter. Some kidnappings have resulted in disappearances. Paraguayan law prohibits torture, but some police officers and other government officials engage in it anyway. The State Department report mentions that ‚Äúsome security forces and government prosecutors‚Äù in Paraguay, ‚Äúacting in official capacity but without government knowledge or support,‚Äù may have ‚Äúoccasionally killed individuals for personal gain.‚Äù Although candidates for public office are supposed to issue financial disclosures, many do not. Extortion is common at many levels of Paraguayan society. Military officers have routinely extorted money from their subordinates, and Civil Registry Office officials have demanded money illegally for performing standard services. In practice, official corruption is rarely punished. Rights of prisoners Paraguayan prisons are not up to international standards. Conditions have been described as ‚Äúdeplorable.‚Äù Among the problems are ‚Äúviolence, mistreatment, overcrowding, inadequate and poorly trained staff, deteriorating infrastructure, unsanitary living conditions, poor food safety standards, and inadequate medical and psychological care.‚Äù Some inmates actually have weapons. Deaths while in custody are not uncommon. Certain prisoners demand bribes from visitors in order to arrange contact with the inmates they are visiting. As of 2010. about 30 percent of the inmates in Paraguayan prisons should, according to the country's constitution, have been released already but were still being held pending a judge's order. Inmates can receive better accommodations in exchange for regular payments. In 2010, it was discovered that inmates in one prison were blackmailing underage girls to come to the prison to videotape sex acts. It was alleged that some prison officials, including the warden and clergy working in the prison, were involved in this activity. Some juvenile offenders are imprisoned in adult prisons. Paraguay permits the media, human-rights groups, the Red Cross, and other organizations to visit prisons and monitor conditions. A National Commission on Prison Reform was created in 2010. A group of international human-rights organizations issued a statement in December 2012 denouncing ‚Äúthe health plight of 10 farmers who have been on a hunger strike for nearly two months after being arbitrarily detained in the prison of Coronel Oviedo, Caaguaz√∫ department, Paraguay.‚Äù The strikers were described as ‚Äúpart of a group of 54 people who have been arbitrarily charged with seven criminal charges including offense of murder, attempted murder, serious injury, criminal association, grave coercion, coercion and invasion.‚Äù The statement listed a series of violations of Paraguayan law that had been made in connection with this case. Human-rights ombudsman The UN Committee on Torture called on Portugal in 2011 to appoint a replacement for the nation's human-rights ombudsman, whose mandate had expired. The committee also expressed concern that the office of ombudsman had insufficient resources, and called on Paraguay to ‚Äúequip the Office of the Ombudsman with sufficient financial, material and human resources to carry out its mandate effectively and independently, in accordance with the Paris Principles.‚Äù References * - Paraguay External links *Freedom of expression in Paraguay - IFEX * See the PARAGUAY page in the pro Justice and Democracy website Habeas-Corpus.net ","title":"Human rights in Paraguay"},{"id":"4513270","text":"Fred Higgins is an English former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s and 1950s.

The stadium has a capacity of 23,500 people. It is one of the venues of the Calcutta Football League. The stadium lies in the Kolkata Maidan area on the northern side of Fort William and it is near the Eden Gardens. The Esplanade metro station on the North-South Corridor of the Kolkata Metro is also nearby. History When East Bengal Club was formed in 1920, they used to play at the Kumortuli Park Ground in the initial days. In 1921, East Bengal Club started playing in the Calcutta Football League Second Division. Most of the matches were held at the Calcutta FC Ground. After the 1923 season, East Bengal Club owners were in the lookout for a club ground of their own where the team can play their matches. According to the existing rule of the maidan, two clubs used to share one common ground. Club's founders and then vice-presidents, Shri Sureshchandra Choudhury and Raybahadur Taritbhushan Ray came to learn that Mohun Bagan shared its ground with National Association, which by that time had ceased to exist. They referred this discrepancy to the police authorities and subsequently demanded the share for East Bengal. It was then that Police Commissioner Charles Tegart ordered Mohun Bagan to share its ground with East Bengal. This sudden decision enraged the Mohun Bagan officials. However, despite their protests, East Bengal Club got the ground for their own in 1924, which they co-shared with their arch-rivals Mohun Bagan until 1963, when finally Mohun Bagan moved out to their own Mohun Bagan Ground. In those days, the goalposts were placed East-West and East Bengal took possession of the half towards the Red Road. Another century old Kolkata club, Aryan F.C. started sharing the club ground since then. About alt= East Bengal ground members gallery The East Bengal Ground has galleries on three sides. The west side is the member's gallery with modern facilities like bucket seats and elevators installed. The half of west side is also shared with Aryan F.C. who have their member's gallery as well, covered in bucket seats which acts as an away gallery for the matches which East Bengal F.C. plays. The east side and north side galleries are still made of a temporary wooden and steel structure and are designated for non-member supporters. The playing pitch is about 100 metres x 60 metres in dimension. Just adjacent the stadium, below the member's gallery is the club tent and the main office located. In 2014, the club tent opened its own cafe lounge for the fans, just beside the members' gallery.  Renovations  First Renovation in 1996 On 12th July 1996, the new Club Office or \\"Tent\\", which is popularly known in Kolkata maidan, was inaugurated by the oldest member of the East Bengal Club. The then club secretary Mr. Dipak \\"Poltu\\" Das gave the honour to Mr. Shankar Pillai (popularly known as Shankar Mali) who was the oldest groundsman and caretaker of the club, to inaugurate the new club tent in the presence of club legends like Ahmed Khan and Byomkesh Bose. The club ground was renovated and a new office was setup at the place where it is currently situated. The playing field was relaid North to South and the new fans gallery was constructed. Second Renovation post 2016 In 2016, renovations were done at the ground with entire playing field being relaid and galleries being renovated with member's gallery being filled in with Red and Gold bucket seats. Elevators were installed and the commentary box was modernised. The playing turf was relaid and drainage was improved for the ground. East Bengal FC officials informed the AIFF that they wanted to host I-League matches at the club ground after the heavy renovations. In 2018, floodlights were installed at the East Bengal Ground. The flood lights would be the biggest among the three Maidan clubs of Kolkata. The first match under floodlights was played in the 2018‚Äì19 Calcutta Premier Division when East Bengal faced Tollygunge Agragami in the season opener, which was however abandoned due to heavy rains as the match was tied 1‚Äì1 at half time.

The concept of \\"human rights,\\" in the context of the Philippines, pertains mainly (but is not limited) to the civil and political rights of a person living in the Philippines by reason of the 1987 Philippines Constitution. Human rights are a justified set of claims that set moral standards to members of the human race, not exclusive to a specific community or citizenship. Membership in the human race is the sole qualification to obtain these rights. Human rights, unlike area-specific conventions of international laws (e.g. European Convention on Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), are universally justifiable as it pertains to the entire human race, regardless of geographical location. The Philippines is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) drafted by the United Nations (UN) in the 1948. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, alongside the Genocide Convention and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, by the United Nations in response to the tragic and horrendous violations of human rights during the Second World War. The United Nations Charter, a treaty, was created in order to define what roles, powers, and duties the United Nations is allowed to practice in dealing with international relations. Article I of the UN Charter states that the UN aims: > \\"To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of > an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting > and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for > all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion;\\" According to the Charter, the jurisdiction of the United Nations is to provide cooperation among the nations, and not act as an international government. The UN Charter paved the way for the drafting of the UDHR. The UDHR aims to promote \\"universal respect for, and the observance of, human rights.\\" Thus, the UDHR is merely a declaration for each signatory to adopt to its own political system. The significance of the UDHR as stated in its Preamble is: > \\"Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the > greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge.\\" As a signatory to the UDHR, the Philippines then declares an understanding and adherence of these fundamental and inalienable rights to its population. The Philippines has adhered to the UDHR through the Bill of Rights, and continued to create laws and policies that cater to a specific sector, like the Labor Code and the Indigenous Peoples' Rights. Besides the UDHR, the Philippines is a signatory to 8 of the 9 UN core human rights treaties, namely: # The International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination or (ICERD), ratified on September 15, 1967, # The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or (ICESR), ratified on June 7, 1974, # The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women or (CEDAW), ratified on August 05, 1981, # The Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment or (CAT), acceded to on June 18, 1986, # The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or (ICCPR), ratified on October 23, 1986, # The Convention on the Rights of the Child or (CRC), ratified on August 21, 1990, # The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families or (CMW), ratified on July 5, 1995, and; # The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or (CRPD), ratified April 15, 2008 Mainly highlighting achievements with respect to UN human rights treaties, the Philippines was re-elected through the vote of 165 separate States out of 192 to the exclusive 47-member UN Human Rights Council during the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly on October 12, 2018.  Practices of human rights   Torture  , numerous sources had reported that torture was being practiced by police and other security forces.  Labor code  Prior to the Marcos Martial Law Era in the Philippines, all labor laws were not codified. President Marcos tasked a committee from the then-called Department of Labor (now the Department of Labor and Employment or DOLE) to consolidate all the existing labor laws of the Philippines. The committee was composed of: Amado G. Inciong, the then Undersecretary of Labor, acting as the chairman of the committee, Director Ricardo Castro, the head of the subcommittee on Labor Relations, Director Diego Atienza, the head of the subcommittee on Labor Standards, and Director Rony Diaz, the head of the subcommittee on Employment and Training. The result was Presidential Decree No. 442 (\\"PD 442\\") or \\"A Decree Instituting the Labor Code and Consolidating Labor and Social Laws to Afford Protection to Labor, Promote Employment and Human Resources Development and Insure the Industrial Peace Based on Social Justice,\\" otherwise known as the \\"Labor Code of the Philippines\\". The consolidation was finished on May 1, 1974 and took effect on November 1, 1974. The Labor Code is the legal code governing employment practices and labor relations in the Philippines. The Labor Code stipulates standards in terms of wages and monetary benefits, hours of work, leaves, rest days, holiday pays, and benefits, among others.  Wages and monetary benefits  Taken from Labor Advisory No. 12 Series of 2013: Payment of Thirteenth Month Pay # Minimum Wage #* Remunerations or earnings paid by an employer to an employee for service rendered are called wages. Article 99 of the Labor Code of the Philippines stipulates that an employer may go over but never below minimum wage. Paying below the minimum wage is illegal. The Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards is the body that sets the amount for the minimum wage. As in the case of the Philippines, the minimum wage of a worker depends on where he works. # Thirteenth Month Pay #* According to Presidential Decree No. 851, an employer is mandated by law to give his employees thirteenth month pay. The thirteenth month pay required by law should not be less than one twelfth of the total basic salary earned by an employee within a calendar year. The thirteenth month pay is exempted from being taxed by the government. The photo below is from the Department of Labor and Employment which shows the computation of a hypothetical thirteenth month pay. # Retirement Pay #* Article 287 of the Philippine Labor Code states that, the retiring age of an employee is sixty (60) years or more but not beyond sixty-five (65) years. The retiring employee who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six months being considered as one whole year. \\"The term 'one-half month salary' shall mean fifteen (15) days plus one twelfth (1/12) of the thirteenth month pay and the cash equivalent of not more than five (5) days of service incentive leaves.\\"  Hours of work  # Normal Hours of Work #* Article 83 and 84 of the Philippine Labor Code, the normal hours of work of an employee shall not exceed eight (8) hours a day. Hours worked shall include all time that an employee is required to be in the workplace and all time during which an employee is permitted to work. Short breaks during working hours shall be counted as hours worked. # Overtime Work #* Article 87 of the Philippine Labor Code states that any work that exceeds eight (8) hours is considered overtime work. This is legal provided that the employee is paid for the overtime work. The computation for the wage is his regular wage plus at least twenty-five percent (25%) of his hourly wage. Work performed beyond eight hours on a holiday or rest day shall be paid an additional compensation equivalent to the rate of the first eight hours on a holiday or rest day plus at least thirty percent (30%) thereof. # Night Shift Differential #* Article 86 of the Philippine Labor Code explains that the night shift is between ten o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning. A night shift differential is payment of not less than ten percent (10%) of the regular hourly wage of an employee for each hour of work performed during this time period.  Rest days  # Weekly Rest Day #* An employer is required to provide each of his employees a rest period of not less than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours after every six (6) consecutive normal work days, as stated in Article 91 of the Philippine Labor Code. The employer shall determine and schedule the weekly rest day of his employees. He must respect the preference of employees as to their weekly rest day when such preference is based on religious grounds. #* If an employer requires his employee to work on his scheduled rest day, he shall be paid an additional compensation of at least thirty percent (30%) of his regular wage. #* If the employee has no regular work days or rest days, and he is required by his employer to work on a Sunday and on a holiday, he shall be paid an additional compensation of at least thirty percent (30%) of his regular wage.  Holiday pay  # Special Non-Working Holiday Pay #* If an employee works on August 21, Ninoy Aquino Day, November 1, All Saints Day, and/or December 31, Last Day of the year, his wage will be: #** for first eight (8) hours of work ‚Äì plus thirty percent (30%) of the daily rate #** for excess of eight (8) hours of work ‚Äì plus thirty percent (30%) of hourly rate on said day #* If an employee works on August 21, Ninoy Aquino Day, November 1, All Saints Day, and/or December 31, Last Day of the Year and it falls under his rest day, his wage will be #** for the first eight (8) hours of work ‚Äì plus fifty percent (50%) of the daily rate #** excess of eight (8) hours of work ‚Äì plus thirty percent (30%) of hourly rate on said day #Regular Holiday Pay #*Article 93 and 94 of the Philippine Labor Code states that a worker shall be paid his regular daily wage during regular holidays whether or not the employee goes to work. The employer can require an employee to work on any holiday but the employee must be paid an amount double his regular wage. #*If the holiday falls under the employee's rest day, and he decides to work, his wage for the first eight (8) hours of his work will be doubled. If he works for more than eight (8) hours, then thirty percent (30%) of his hourly rate will be added to his wage for that day. #*The regular holidays according to EO 292 as amended by RA 9849 are as follows: #** New Year ‚Äì January 1 #** Maundy Thursday ‚Äì Movable Date #** Good Friday ‚Äì Movable Date #** Araw ng Kagitingan ‚Äì April 9 #** Labor Day ‚Äì 1 May #** Independence Day ‚Äì June 12 #** National Heroes Day ‚Äì Last Monday of August #** Bonifacio Day ‚Äì November 30 #** Eid'l Fitr ‚Äì Movable Date #** Eid'l Adha ‚Äì Movable Date #** Christmas Day ‚Äì December 25 #** Rizal Day ‚Äì December 30  Leave  # Service Incentive Leave #* Article 95 of the Philippine Labor Code states that if an employee has given at least one (1) year of service, he shall be entitled to a yearly service incentive leave of five (5) days with pay. # Paternity Leave #* The paternity leave is not found in the Labor Code. The basis for the paternity leave is Republic Act No. 8187, otherwise known as the \\"Paternity Leave Act of 1996\\". RA 8187 states that a married male employee is allowed to take 7 days off work with full pay for the first four deliveries. # Maternity Leave #* Republic Act No. 7322 states that a pregnant employee who has paid at least three monthly maternity contributions to the Social Security System in the twelve-month period preceding the semester of her childbirth, abortion or miscarriage and who is currently employed shall be paid a daily maternity benefit equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of her present basic salary, allowances and other benefits or the cash equivalent of such benefits for sixty (60) for normal delivery a seventy-eight (78) for caesarian delivery. #* The maternity leave can be extended without pay if any illness medically certified are to come as a result of the pregnancy, delivery, abortion, or miscarriage which leaves the woman unfit to work. #* As with the paternity leave, the maternity leave is only valid for the first four deliveries.  Employment of women  # Facilities for Women #* Article 132 of the Labor Code of the Philippines requires employers to: #** Provide seats proper for women and let them use these seats when they are free from work or during work hours provided that they can perform their duties in this position without sacrificing efficiency. #** Establish separate toilet rooms for men and women and provide at least a dressing room for women. #** Establish a nursery in a workplace for the benefit of women employees. #** Determine appropriate minimum age and other standards for retirement or termination in special occupations such as those of flight attendants and the like. # Discrimination #* Article 134 of the Labor Code of the Philippines states that a woman cannot be paid a lesser compensation than a man for work of equal value. #* Favoring a male employee over a female employee with regard to promotion, training opportunities, study, scholarship grants based on only their sexes is also illegal. # Prohibited Acts #* Based on Article 137 the employer is not allowed to: #** Deprive any woman employee of any of the benefits mentioned above and in Articles 130‚Äì136 of the Labor Code or to terminate any woman employee for the purpose of stopping her from enjoying said benefits. #** Terminate a woman because of her pregnancy while on leave or in confinement due to it. #** Discharge or refuse the admission of such woman from returning to her work for fear that she may again be pregnant.  Employment and termination  # Security of Tenure #* Article 279 of the Labor code discusses that if an employee is already a regular employee, the employer cannot terminate his services without just cause and due process. An employee unjustly dismissed from work can return to it without any losses of benefits, privileges, and allowances from the time he was unjustly dismissed to the time of his actual return. # Regular and Casual Employment #* An employee will be considered a regular employee if he has been able to performs tasks that are necessary in the business or trade of the employer, except when the employee was hired for a specific project and its completion also signifies the employee's termination and if the nature of work or services is seasonal and the employment is for the duration of the season. The employment is said to be casual if his nature of work has not been covered by the aforementioned sentences. After a year of rendering service, whether continuous or not, an employee shall be deemed regular, as stated by Article 280 of the Philippine Labor Code. # Probationary Employment #* Article 281 of the Labor Code states that probationary employment should not go over six (6) months unless it is under an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer period. An employee who continues to work after the probationary period will be considered a regular employee. A probationary employee may be discharged for a just cause or when he fails to qualify as a regular employee.  Benefits  # Social Security Benefits #* According to RA 1161, as amended by RA 8282, \\"The Social Security Program provides a package of benefits in the event of death, disability, sickness, maternity, and old age. Basically, the Social Security System (SSS) provides for a replacement of income lost on account of the aforementioned contingencies.\\" A worker, whether regular or casually employed is entitled to these benefits. # PhilHealth Benefits #* According to RA 7875, as amended by RA 9241, \\"The National Health Insurance Program (NHIP), formerly known as Medicare, is a health insurance program for SSS members and their dependents whereby the healthy subsidize the sick who may find themselves in need of financial assistance when they get hospitalized.\\" Employees of the public and private sector are covered by these benefits.  Indigenous peoples' rights   The Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act  The Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Rights Act of 1997 recognized and promoted the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICC/IPs) enumerated within the framework of the Constitution. It committed the State to recognize and promote the rights of ICCs/IPs to: *Protect the rights of ICCs/IPs to their ancestral domains to ensure their economic, social and cultural well being and shall recognize the applicability of customary laws governing property rights or relations in determining the ownership and extent of ancestral domain; *Recognize, respect and protect the rights of ICCs/IPs to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions and institutions.

It declared that the State recognizes its obligations to respond to the strong expression of the ICCs/IPs for cultural integrity by assuring maximum ICC/IP participation in the direction of education, health, as well as other services of ICCs/IPs, in order to render such services more responsive to the needs and desires of these communities.  Violations against human rights   Marcos administration (1965‚Äì1986)  On September 21, 1972, then President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law in the Philippines. Marcos gave the armed forces the power to prevent or suppress‚Ä¶ any act of insurrection or rebellion. A total of 398 disappearances, 1,388 extrajudicial killings, and 1,499 killed or wounded in massacres were recorded but not every victim was accounted for. After the declaration of Martial Law, Marcos issued six (6) general orders and an instruction to close privately owned media facilities. The Press Secretary, Francisco Tatad, and Secretary for National Defense, Juan Ponce Enrile, were ordered by Marcos \\"to take over and control or cause the taking over and control of all such newspapers, magazines, radio and television facilities and all other media communications...\\" The information released to the public was highly censored and prevented journalists from releasing any suspicious information about the administration. For the dictatorship, failure to abide would lead to arrest and eventual torture and execution. Lawyer and statesman Sen. Jose W. Diokno, the father of human rights, was one of those arrested. He would be released and later founded the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG), the largest group of lawyers to combat human rights abuses by the dictatorship, and it managed to deal with over 90 percent of human rights cases during martial law. The assassination of Senator Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino triggered the peaceful 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, led by Aquino's wife, Corazon \\"Cory\\" Aquino. The peaceful revolution united the nation in a call against Marcos to uphold their human rights. It led to the abolition of Martial Law (de jure abolished in 1981), the exile of the Marcos family, as well as Cory Aquino's rise to the presidency and the current 1987 Constitution. This, in turn paved the way for the creation of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights, now the Commission on Human Rights which was founded by Atty. Diokno.  Arroyo administration (2001‚Äì2010)  The Arroyo Administration was riddled by its several issues on several forms of violations against human rights. Most of these which include the increase in military power and presence, especially in Muslim Mindanao. Philip Alston, a UN Rapporteur, published Promotion and Protection of all Human Rights, Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including the Right To Development in 2008 that chronicled and reported the situation he had found while in the Philippines. Many incidents of extrajudicial killings were linked to this report, most notable of which is Sichi Bustamante-Gandinao, who was a direct testimony of the abuses concerning the military.  Sichi Bustamante- Gandinao  Sichi Bustamante-Gandinao was a peasant organizer in Salay, Misamis Oriental. She was the chairman of the Misamis Oriental Farmers Organization and the coordinator of the party list group called Bayan Muna. She was also an outspoken critic of the actions the Citizens' Armed Force Geographical Unit or CAFGU, and how they disrupt the relatively peaceful communities in Misamis Oriental. Philip Alston was a UN Rapporteur, who had Gandinao as a testimony to the extrajudicial killings, and other violations of human rights the military was practicing, whether it was the military is contested by the Military. The Alston report was published in 2008, which highlighted these abuses through the United Nations General Assembly. On the March 2007, however, Gandinao, together with her husband and daughter, was walking home after a day of doing farm work. Gandinao was then shot four times by two men on a motorcycle heading towards a nearby military camp, while Gandinao's family helplessly watched the attack. The local officials and passers-by all told Gandinao's husband and daughter that they were too busy to tend to the bleeding Gandinao. According to reports, after two hours of bleeding profusely, the assailants went back to the scene of the crime and even watched the entire ordeal of Gandinao. Her husband had to carry her to the Cagayan de Oro ambulance, which took another hour to get to the actual hospital. In the Cagayan de Oro hospital, Gandinao was pronounced dead on arrival.  Vigilantism and death squad  According to the Alston report, the presence of \\"vigilantism\\" and death squad in Davao has been a commonplace occurrence, and has been going on for some time now, prior to his visit in the Philippines from 2006 to 2007. The Death Squad, however, operate with no intention of hiding their identities, and in broad daylight. Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte has held office, aside from a brief stint as a congressman, since 1988. Rodrigo Duterte is known for his strict, anti-criminal approach in governing Davao City.Go, J. R. R. (2014). Political Leadership and Education Governance at the Municipal Level. However, in the same report, Rodrigo Duterte has admitted that hundreds of unsolved murders were committed during his time as mayor, and that he takes for \\"full responsibility\\" of it. When Duterte was first elected as mayor, he faced a Davao with problems like rampant youth gangs, the New Peoples' Army (NPA) killing policemen routinely, and crime. The Davao Death Squad (DDS) has had over 500 victims since 1998; killing targets in public and in broad daylight. These executions were a response to petty crimes, and targets are sent warnings explaining why they are targeted by the DDS. It was, however, noted that during Duterte's term as mayor, criminal activity has decreased significantly. It should also be noted, however, that there are hundreds of unsolved murders.  Benigno Aquino Administration (2010‚Äì2016)  On June 30, 2010, Benigno Aquino III was sworn into office as the President of the Philippines.\\"The Philippines under the Aquino Administration\\" THE PHILIPPINES UNDER THE AQUINO ADMINISTRATION (2013): n. pag. . Official Gazette, 2013. Web. November 5, 2015. Notable acts during his term include the implementation of the K-12 program, the revocation of midnight appointments, the founding of the Philippine Truth Commission, the creation of agencies such as the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), and the framing of the Bangsamoro Basic Law. The administration vowed to eradicate corruption within the government system, but has yet to resolve such cases as those regarding Hacienda Luisita and the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam. Listed below are the cases of human rights violations under the second Aquino administration: Journalist killings The number of journalist killings under the Aquino administration has been noted to be the highest since 1986. Because of this, the Philippines has been ranked by CNN as the third deadliest country for journalists. Information about disappearances and murders of reporters are kept from the public, making several agencies/organizations as well as whistleblowers at risk of exposure to harm. Some of the well-known journalists killed in their line of work during the Aquino government include: Henry Araneta, Desidario Camangyan, Joselito Agustin, Gerardo Ortega, Romeo Olea, Christopher Guarin, Mario Sy, Fernando Solijon, Joas Dignos, and Rubylita Garcia. According to the 2014 Human Rights Watch Report, only 6 out of 26 cases managed to identify/capture their suspects. The Aquino administration implemented reforms towards more effective criminal investigation procedures, in addition to passing laws to better uphold human rights. However, these reforms are underdeveloped. An example is Administration Order 35, which acquired problems in identifying which case to pursue due to the process requirements. On June 15, 2020, Maria Ressa, the founder and executive editor of the news website Rappler, and Reynaldo Santos Jr. researcher at Rappler were sentenced with a minimum of six months and one day and a maximum of six years‚Äô imprisonment and fine of 4000 US dollars for moral damages and 4000 US dollars for exemplary damages. They were the critics of President Rodrigo Duterte and reported on his ‚Äúwar of drugs‚Äù campaign that killed more than 12000 Filipinos. Human Rights Watch found in an investigation that the police are falsifying the evidence to justify the illegal killing of civilians.  Duterte administration (2016 ‚Äì present)  On June 26, 2020, Philippines police arrested around 20 people at the LGBT pride event. They were protesting against an anti-terrorism bill, which will eliminate legal protection and police can detain groups and individuals without any warrant under the label of terrorism. The arrest took place without any explanation from the police force. HRW urged the authority to release those detainees and allow them to exercise their fundamental right of protesting peacefully. On July 3, 2020, Amnesty International criticized the controversial Anti- Terrorism Act, signed by President Rodrigo Duterte and said that the new law is the latest example of the country‚Äôs ever-worsening human rights record. Alleged extrajudicial killings With the vigilante killings becoming rampant, the Citizen's Council for Human Rights (CCHR) asked President Duterte to initiate measures to stop the surge of extrajudicial killings. The killing of Larry Que on December 20, 2016 was the first recorded media-related killing under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Shortly before becoming president Duterte said, \\"Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch. Freedom of expression cannot help you if you have done something wrong.\\" Recognising the danger to journalists, the president established the Presidential Task Force on Violations of the Right to Life, Liberty and Security of the Members of the Media in October 2016,. On August 21, 2020, it was reported the United Nations had raised concerns with the Philippine government over the killing of peace consultant Randall \\"Randy\\" Echanis and human rights defender Zara Alvarez The UN Human Rights Office described the situation as alarming since the two victims were previously tagged as terrorists because of their work, and called for transparent investigations. On August 24, 2020, Human Rights Watch revealed that employees of Karapatan, a human rights organization in Philippines had received death threats. The threats came a week after unidentified gunmen shot dead Zara Alvarez, a legal worker for the group, in Bacolod City in the central Philippines on August 17. Karapatan has been alleged to be a particular target of Philippine security forces and their agents.

Labor  Department of Labor and Employment The DOLE was originally named the Bureau of Labor on June 18, 1908 under the Department of Commerce and Police. It was renamed and founded as the Department of Labor on December 8, 1933 as mandated by Legislative Act No. 4121. After a complete internal restructuring in 1982, it was renamed the Department of Labor and Employment. It concerns itself with the protection and welfare of Filipino workers both in the country as well as abroad, and responds accordingly to socio-political and economic challenges that would affect the workers. DOLE is also mandated to create policies and programs as an arm of the Executive Branch in its field of concern. It has set up a number of offices and agencies: 16 regional offices, 83 field offices, 4 satellite offices, 28 overseas posts, 6 bureaus, 7 staff services, and 11 attached agencies. These subgroups are tasked to closely monitor and coordinate the implementation of policies and programs. =Major final outputs= There are seven major services offered by DOLE, namely: #Job Search Assistance Services to assist jobseekers opting for wage employment. The service aims to provide employment guidance and counseling, job referral and facilitation, and timely and accurate jobs and skills description. #Capacity Building Services for Livelihood and Employability of Workers in the Informal and other Specific Sectors to assist the marginalized and disadvantaged workers‚Äîinformal sector workers, returning OFWs, indigent students and out-of-school youth‚Äîby providing skills and entrepreneurship training; access to livelihood opportunities and development, and employment interventions. #Social Partnership Promotion and Dispute Resolution Services to minimize lost working days of workers in formal employment.

DOLE, with the International Labour Organization (ILO), was a major contributor to the adoption of the Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers, the Maritime Labour Convention of 2006, and The Kasambahay Law (R.A. 10461).  International Labor Organization  The International Labor Organization (ILO) is a tripartite organization that started working with the Philippines in the year 1994. Its vision is as follows: :\\"The main aims of the ILO are to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue on work-related issues.\\" The ILO Manila office has been active since its founding, starting with the ratifying of the Workman's Compensation (Accidents) Convention 17 based on Act. No. 1874 to extend responsibility of employers for personal injuries and death suffered by employees at work. =Programmes and projects= Below are a number of the recent programmes and projects by ILO Manila. #Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) is ILO Manila's main project. It was made to support the country's Labor Employment Program (LEP). The two major priorities are decent jobs for a competitive Philippines, and improved labor market governance. To achieve this, the ILO will help strengthen the working capacity of the Philippines and apply international labor conventions to constantly update the LEP. The United Nations Development Assistance Framework has listed the DWCP as ILO Manila's top priority. #Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement Sector (INFRES) Project (June 4, 2001 ‚Äì December 31, 2006) was completed to improve their living conditions, poor people require access to employment and basic goods and services. The poor can improve their situation through national and local investment in infrastructure that provides jobs. #ILO-IPEC Project in support of the Philippine Time-Bound Programme (September 2, 2002 ‚Äì August 31, 2007) was the first and most significant contribution toward the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. It has been designed to leverage resources, and to link up with national and international programs for the benefit of Filipino boys and girls. #Strategies and Tools Against Social Exclusion and Poverty (STEP) (January 1, 2003 ‚Äì June 1, 2005) aimed to provide better quality of life to informal economy workers and their families through better access to health care. This is a donor project from the Government of Norway. #Protecting Domestic Workers against Forced Labour and Trafficking (DOMWORK) (May 3, 2004 ‚Äì December 31, 2006) was a programme on the regulation and condition of Filipino domestic workers. They plan to empower domestic workers on their rights as well as reduce the cases of abuse. ::\\"Through discussions on gender equality, the ILO noted that problems had deepened for the most vulnerable, including women in domestic work. Yet while the global economic downturn has contributed to aggravating their vulnerabilities, domestic workers are beginning to realize gains through changes in public attitude.\\" #Tripartite Action for the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers in the ASEAN Region (May 1, 2012 ‚Äì March 31, 2016) is an ongoing ASEAN TRIANGLE project that aims to significantly reduce the exploitation of labour migrants in the region through increased legal and safe migration and improved labour protection. This is a donor project from the Government of Canada. #Building the Capacity of the Philippines Labour Inspectorate (December 15, 2014 ‚Äì December 14, 2017) is a collaborative project with DOLE to strengthen its Labour Law Compliance System (LLCS) by promoting a positive mindset towards work. Indigenous peoples # National Commission on Indigenous Peoples #* The NCIP was born through the merging of the Office for Northern Cultural Communities (ONCC), and the Office for Southern Cultural Communities (OSCC) in the year 1997 through RA 8371 or \\"Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997\\". It is a highly specialized commission with different projects for each region. # International Labor Organization #* The International Labor Organization started working with the Philippines in the year 1994. Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement Sector (INFRES) and The Indigenous Peoples Development Programme (IPDP) are two of their many projects. # Tebtebba #* Tebtebba is an organization that was established in the year 1996. They have been an active participant in processes which led to the adoption of international human rights law and other international instruments, policies and agreements. These include the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the establishment of spaces within the United Nations, such as the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, among others. # Cordillera Peoples Alliance #* The Cordillera Peoples Alliance (CPA) was founded in 1984.

He is also Adjunct Professor (\\"Distinguished Scholar in Residence\\"), Department of Economics, American University, Washington D.C. He is Turing Fellow and Chair of the Data Ethics Group (DEG) of the Alan Turing Institute Floridi is best known for his work on two areas of philosophical research: the philosophy of information and information ethics. Between 2008 and 2013, he held the Research Chair in philosophy of information and the UNESCO Chair in Information and Computer Ethics at the University of Hertfordshire. He was the founder and director of the IEG,\` an interdepartmental research group on the philosophy of information at the University of Oxford, and of the GPI the research Group in Philosophy of Information at the University of Hertfordshire. He was the founder and director of the SWIF, the Italian e-journal of philosophy (1995‚Äì2008). He is a former Governing Body Fellow of St Cross College, Oxford. His works have been translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Hungarian, Japanese, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish.  Early life and education  Floridi was born in Rome in 1964, and studied at Rome University La Sapienza (Laurea, first class with distinction, 1988), where he was originally educated as a historian of philosophy. Biography, in Italian, from Cervelli in Fuga (Roma: Accenti, 2001) He soon became interested in analytic philosophy and wrote his tesi di laurea (MA dissertation) in philosophy of logic, on Michael Dummett's anti-realism. He obtained his Master of Philosophy (1989) and PhD degree (1990) from the University of Warwick, working in epistemology and philosophy of logic with Susan Haack (who was his PhD supervisor) and Michael Dummett. Floridi's early student years are partly recounted in the non-fiction book The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece, where he was \\"Luciano\\". During his graduate and postdoctoral years, he covered the standard topics in analytic philosophy in search of a new methodology. He sought to approach contemporary problems from a heuristically powerful and intellectually enriching perspective when dealing with lively philosophical issues. During his graduate studies, he began to distance himself from classical analytic philosophy. In his view, the analytic movement had lost its way. For this reason, he worked on pragmatism (especially Peirce) and foundationalist issues in epistemology and philosophy of logic.  Academic career  He was a lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Warwick in 1990-1991. He joined the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Oxford in 1990 and the OUCL (Oxford's Department of Computer Science) in 1999. He was Junior Research Fellow in Philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford University (1990-1994), Frances Yates Fellow in the History of Ideas at the Warburg Institute, University of London (1994‚Äì1995) and Research Fellow in Philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford University (1994-2001). During these years in Oxford, he held lectureships in different Colleges. Between 1994 and 1996, he also held a post-doctoral research scholarship at the Department of Philosophy, University of Turin. Between 2001 and 2006, he was Markle Foundation Senior Research Fellow in Information Policy at the Programme in Comparative Media Law and Policy, Oxford University. Between 2002 and 2008, he was Associate Professor of Logic at the Universit√† degli Studi di Bari. In 2006, he became Fellow by Special Election of St Cross College, Oxford University, where he played for the squash team.According to The St Cross College Annual Record, \\"One of the achievements of which is most proud is having his name engraved on the Oxford Squash Plate and Cup trophies, as captain of the Wolfson teams who won cuppers in 1998-2002.\\" In 2008, he was appointed full professor of philosophy at the University of Hertfordshire, to hold the newly established research chair in philosophy of informationUniversity of Hertfordshire Website and, since 2009, the UNESCO Chair in Information and Computer Ethics. In his first book, Scepticism and the Foundation of Epistemology, Floridi was already looking for a concept of subject-independent knowledge close to what he now identifies as semantic information.Scepticism and the Foundation of Epistemology. During his postdoctoral studies, as a Junior Research Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford University, he began to embrace a more Neo-Kantian philosophy, which led him to spend one academic year in Marburg, where he focused on Ernst Cassirer's version of Neo-Kantianism.*Interview for the American Philosophical Association ‚Äî Philosophy And Computing Newsletter He began working exclusively on what is now known as the philosophy of information during his years as Research Fellow, still at Wolfson College.  Philosophy  According to Floridi, it is necessary to develop a constructionist philosophy, where design, modelling and implementation replace analysis and dissection. Shifting from one set of tasks to the other, philosophy could then stop retreating into the increasingly small corner of its self-sustaining investigations and hence reacquire a wider view about what really matters. Slowly, Floridi has come to characterise his constructionist philosophy as an innovative field, now known as the philosophy of information, the new area of research that has emerged from the computational/informational turn. Floridi approaches the philosophy of information from the perspectives of logic and epistemology (theoretical), and computer science, IT and Humanities Computing (theoretical). For example, in the Preface of Philosophy and Computing, published in 1999, he wrote that the book was meant for philosophy students who need IT literacy to use computers efficiently or indispensable background knowledge for the critical understanding of our digital age. The latter provides a basis for the would-be branch of philosophy, the philosophy of information. PI, or PCI (Philosophy of Computing and Information), became his major research interest. Floridi's perspective is that there is a need for a broader concept of information, which includes computation, but not only computation. This new framework provides a theoretical framework within which to make sense of various lines of research that have emerged since the fifties. The second advantage is PI's perspective on the development of philosophy through time. In his view, PI gives us a much wider and more profound perspective on what philosophy might have actually been doing throughout the centuries. Currently, Floridi is working on two areas of research: computer ethics (see the entry information ethics) and the concept of information. Key to this area of work is the claim that ICT (Information and Communications Technology) is radically re- engineering or re-ontologizing the infosphere.

On February 5, 2020, the company announced management changes effective from April 1, 2020. Astellas is a member of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFJ) keiretsu. History Early foundations Fujisawa Shoten was started in 1894 by Tomokichi Fujisawa in Osaka, and was renamed Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. in 1943. Yamanouchi Yakuhin Shokai was started in 1923 by Kenji Yamanouchi in Osaka. The company was renamed Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. in 1940 and moved to Tokyo in 1942. Both companies started their overseas expansion at about the same time, opening offices in Taiwan in 1962 and 1963, respectively, and in the United States and Europe from 1977 onwards. Recent times and mergers Fujisawa acquired Lyphomed in 1990 and thereafter established its US R&D; center in Deerfield, Illinois. Yamanouchi's R&D; center in Leiderdorp was established with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical division of Royal Gist Brocades in 1991. Fujisawa and Yamanouchi combined in a \\"merger of equals,\\" forming Astellas Pharma on 1 April 2005. At least some of its older products continue to be distributed under the original brand, ostensibly due to high brand-name recognition.\\"Yamanouchi Pimafucin (natamycin) product line manufactured at least up to 11/2007\\" Astellas had a collaboration agreement with CoMentis from 2008 to 2014 focused on development of beta-secretase inhibitor therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. In 2009, the company's tacrolimus-containing products Prograf and Advagraf showed they were prone to dosing errors within Europe, leading to serious adverse reactions among a number of patients, due to deficits in packaging and labeling, deficits corrected after a warning from the UK MHRA. On June 9, 2010, Astellas acquired OSI Pharmaceuticals for $4.0 billion. In December 2014, Astellas expanded its 18-month-old collaboration with Cytokinetics, focusing on the R&D; and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators. The companies announced they will advance the development of CK-2127107 (a fast skeletal troponin activator) into Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy and possibly other neuromuscular conditions. The collaboration was expected to generate more than $600 million for Cytokinetics, as well as $75 million in milestone payments. In November 2015, the company announced its move to acquire Ocata Therapeutics (formerly Advanced Cell Technology) for $379 million. The deal was completed in February 2016. Later in November 2015 the company announced it would sell its dermatology business to LEO Pharma for $725 million. In October 2016 Astellas announced it would acquire Ganymed Pharmaceuticals for $1.4 billion In April 2017, the company announced it would acquire Belgium-based drug discovery firm Ogeda for up to a total ‚Ç¨800 million, strengthening its late-stage pipeline with Ogeda's drug candidate, fezolinetant. In November 2017, the company announced that it exercised an option to purchase Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Mitobridge, which is developing treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and age-related diseases. In August 2018, Astellas announced it would acquire Quethera Limited for $109 million. In December 2018, the company announced it would acquire Potenza Therapeutics, Inc. In December 2019, Astellas Pharma announced it would buy Audentes Therapeutics Inc for approximately $3 billion in cash as well as acquiring Xyphos Biosciences, Inc later in the same month. Audentes will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary within Astellas, and will serve as the Center of Excellence for the newly created Genetic Regulation Primary Focus, providing leadership for AAV pipeline advancement through commercialization, manufacturing expansion, and next-generation research initiatives. The acquisition includes Astellas gaining Xyphos‚Äô Advanced Cellular Control through Engineered Ligands (ACCEL) technology platform. Astellas Pharma‚Äôs Smyraf (ingredient: peficitinib) obtained regulatory approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the third oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to receive approval. In October 2020, Astellas announced it would acquire iota Biosciences, Inc. for $127.5 million, with shareholders eligible to receive up to a further $176.5 million upon the achievement of predetermined milestones.https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/astellas-to-acquire-iota- biosciences/?s=79 Acquisition history The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list): Controversies In June 2016, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) gave Astellas a year-long suspension, after complaints it had \\"purposely misled the PMCPA.\\" In particular, Astellas had not fully disclosed the nature of a meeting which had purported to be a \\"genuine advisory board\\". In May 2017, the ABPI extended the suspension by a further 12 months, based on findings that Astellas was not adequately overseeing and training nurses, and that it had failed to provide complete prescribing information for several medicines. In June 2017, Astellas was reprimanded for \\"producing a large number of promotional materials, which had been used for a number of years, that did not include the required prescribing information related to some serious or common adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions, for a total of eight drugs\\". In December 2018, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) published their findings following an allegation that Astellas had \\"inappropriately awarded research funding\\" to a senior clinician at a British hospital, directly resulting in the hospital adopting a protocol which was subsequently abandoned less than three years later \\"because of poor outcomes\\". This report also reprimanded Astellas for failing to provide sufficient and timely information to investigators. In April 2019, Astellas agreed to pay the United States Department of Justice $100 million to resolve allegations that it had conspired to offer kickbacks via Medicare copay foundations. Business Astellas' franchise areas are urology, immunology (transplantation), cardiology, and infectious disease. Priority areas for R&D; are infectious diseases, diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, oncology, and diseases of the central nervous system. Recently noted, Astellas Venture Management has funded Oncorus, which recently raised $79.5 million in a series B financing round to move two oncolytic viruses through development. Products Some of the key products produced by Astellas include: * Adenocard (adenosine injection) - Pharmacologic stress agent for myocardial perfusion scan * Adenoscan (adenosine injection) - Pharmacologic stress agent for myocardial perfusion scan * Advagraf (tacrolimus) - Prevention of post-transplant organ rejection * AmBisome (amphotericin B) - Anti-fungal - marketed with Gilead Sciences. * Amevive (alefacept) - plaque psoriasis * Astagraf XL (tacrolimus) - Prevention of post-transplant organ rejection * Cresemba (isavuconazole) - Anti-fungal * Enfortumab vedotin - Antibody-drug conjugate for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma * Flomax (tamsulosin hydrochloride) - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) **Flomax MR capsules were discontinued in 2005, replaced by Flomaxtra XL, containing the same active ingredient * Lexiscan (regadenoson injection) - Pharmacologic stress agent for myocardial perfusion scan * Macugen (pegaptanib sodium) - Anti-angiogenic - marketed with Gilead Sciences in the US and Pfizer Outside of US. * Mycamine (micafungin sodium) - Anti-fungal * Myrbetriq (mirabegron) - Overactive bladder (OAB) - US only marketed by Pfizer Outside of US. * Prograf (tacrolimus) - Prevention of post-transplant organ rejection * Protopic (tacrolimus ointment) - Atopic dermatitis (eczema) * Symoron (methadone HCL) - Opioid replacement therapy * Tarceva (erlotinib) - Non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer - marketed with Hoffmann-La Roche (Genentech). * Vaprisol (conivaptan) - Hyponatremia * Vesicare (solifenacin succinate) - Overactive bladder (OAB) - marketed with GlaxoSmithKline. * Vibativ (telavancin) - bactericidal lipoglycopeptide - marketed with Theravance. * Xospata (gilteritinib) - AXL receptor tyrosine kinase * Xtandi (enzalutamide) - Prostate cancer - marketed with Pfizer.  Distribution agreements  In 2007, the company narrowed UK distribution of Advagraf and Prograf to a sole distributor, UniChem, in reaction to pharmacist complaints about drug availability from wholesale sources. This narrow distribution was revised to three firms in 2010, covering all of its products in the UK: AAH, Alliance Healthcare, and Phoenix Healthcare Distribution. Operations The company's headquarters are in Tokyo, with research centers in Tsukuba and Osaka. Clinical development is centered in Northbrook, Illinois, La Jolla, California, and Leiden, Netherlands. Combined revenues of the two pre-merger companies were $7.9 billion in 2004. Worldwide the company employs about 17,000 people. The United States subsidiary of Astellas is Astellas US LLC.

As the workers had already gone home, a considerable length of time passed before efforts to combat the fire started, and out of fear for theft, the fire hydrants had been removed. The people of Holmen also blocked the civilian fire brigade, possibly in the belief that since it was a military area, the military should take care of it. There had been an extended period without rain and the dry wood, combined with the storage of rope work and tar, made the fire spread quickly. The wind blew especially strong from east-southeast, and that meant the countless embers were carried through the air into the city. Because of the strong sunlight, small fires were difficult to detect until they have taken hold. This is why the fire spread from Gammelholm to the main magazine along Holmens Canal (Holmens Kanal Danish) and over Holmens Canal to the quarter around Saint Nicolai Church and from there, along Gammel Strand to the area around Nytorv/Gammeltorv.  The fire at Nicolai Church  Right by Saint Nicolai Church, after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, infrastructure to fight fires had been constructed because the area was very densely built up. A basin that could hold 400 barrels of water had been excavated for use. In addition, a pumping station was built that could pump water through an 800-foot-long hose. The pumps were able to raise the pressure to such a level that it could deliver one barrel of water per minute from the hose. But when a spark set fire to the church tower, nobody could find the key to the door of the pumping station. Only some time later did anyone think of kicking the door in. By then, the fire had already taken hold and the residents in the surrounding quarter were panicked. The road became so full of people, who were also transporting furniture to safety from the fire, that the water hoses could not be brought close to the fire. Soon the church burned to the ground, and with it the pumps. At that point, the Saint Nicolai quarter could not be saved.  Fighting the fire  The majority of the residents in the area threatened by the fire chose to flee, but in some places residents chose to stay in their houses and fight the fire. This happened in the first three to four houses on the north side of √òstergade. Here people spread themselves throughout the houses both inside and out, armed with buckets and plenty of water. This prevented the fire from taking hold and saved the neighbouring street of K√∏bmagergade at the same time, since it would have inevitably have spread to there as well. The Conference Advisory, Carsten Anker, had his mansion on the corner of Ving√•rdsstr√¶de and Kongens Nytorv saved by covering both it and a connected building with a sail that constantly had water poured on it. The Justice Advisory, Peter Uldall, saved his mansion in Vimmelskaftet by paying a large party to stay and put out any embers. It also prevented the fire from spreading to the northern side of the plaza, so only the southern side burned down.  Consequences  The fire died out on Sunday, 7 July, around 4 pm. It had destroyed 909 houses and partially damaged 74. Just over 6,000 of the just under 100,000 residents in the capital were made homeless. A large number of them took refuge in the ruins of the recently burned-down Christianborgs Castle, the remaining walls of which were so large that an entire family could move into a window niche. The stables were also used as housing. The fire had, together with Copenhagen's fire of 1728, in effect burned down almost the whole of Copenhagen's medieval and Renaissance heritage and so only a few houses from before the 18th century remain in that part of the city. The fire was a strong contributing factor to the foundation of Denmark‚Äôs first credit institution, Kreditkassen for Husejerne i Kj√∏benhavn, in 1797. After the fire, a large-scale plan was designed by the city planner J√∏rgen Henrich Rawert and the construction master Peter Meyn. The plan dictated the newly-constructed houses should be made of masonry (instead of being timber framed) and house corners at intersections should be diagonal and the streets straightened so that the fire department's long ladder companies could navigate the streets more easily.

He was dismissed in June 2006 after ignoring government requests to halt fighting with the Islamic Courts Union militia. Somali Civil War United Somali Congress/Somali Salvation Alliance (USC/SSA) Yalahow is a relative of Ali Mahdi Muhammad, the interim president of Somalia after the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 and faction leader in northern Mogadishu. As the deputy Chairman of United Somali Congress/Somali Salvation Alliance (USC/SSA) of Ali Mahdi Muhammad, Yalhow headed the administration in the Medina district of southern Mogadishu when the civil war broke out in the early 90s. Yalahow draws support from the Abgal, one of the largest Hawiye clans. Ethiopia initially showed interest in him because of his opposition to Hussein Aideed, and supported the leader in his opposition against the new interim government. Local and international media reports documented the arrival of weapons trucked into Mogadishu from Ethiopia for Yalahow. There were many reports of the faction leader visiting the Ethiopian Somali region - particularly Gode, the capital of the Ogaden area - to receive weapons and meet Ethiopian military and government representatives. In August 1998, Ali Mahdi Muhammad and South Mogadishu warlords Hussein Aideed and Mohamed Afrah Qanyare set up a joint administration for Mogadishu, which was rejected by Yalahow, Osman Ali Atto and Hussein Haji Bod. Fighting erupted in early March between loyalists of Yalahow and militiamen funded by the business community in northern Mogadishu after Yalahow tried to impose taxes at the Karan market in northern Mogadishu. The fighting claimed 22 lives and subsided March 15 after Abgal elders arranged a cease-fire and resumption of negotiations. However, fighting flared up again on March 17 and 18, 1999 bringing the total number of casualties to 38 people and 88 injured since the fighting began. The dispute disrupted public transport and telephone lines were cut. Yalahow rejected a plan by elders to end the latest round of fighting and refused to withdraw the tax demand. In addition, another round of clashes was reported between clan militias of Yalahow and those of the Mogadishu governor Hussein Ali Ahmed. The fighting which began later, in mid-March was more political in nature and not a continuation of the fighting sparked by a dispute over taxation rights. This dispute reportedly ended with Yalahow's takeover of equipment belonging to a north Mogadishu radio station which supported Ali Mahdi Muhammad, his former ally.AFP, April 3, 1998 Yalahow, whose militia were now well armed, declared he would never recognise a joint administration established by his rivals. He later changed his mind when offered the post of third deputy chairman of the proposed authority.The Monitor, July 18‚Äì19, 1998AFP, July 12 & 19, 1998 In March 2001 his militia kidnapped nine aid workers from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res who were vaccinating children against polio. Somali Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC) In December 2001 his forces lost control over the Jazira airstrip. He had split from his \\"right-hand man and deputy,\\" Mahmud Muhammad Finish, who was also of the Da'ud subclan of the Abgal clan. Yalahow became a senior leader of the Somali Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC), while Finish was loyal to the Transitional National Government (TNG) movement. The two battled over the control of the airstrip, as well as over control of sections of Mogadishu. On February 26, 2002, fighting broke out between the two warlords again, killing at least twelve people. Yalahow lost a technical and an unarmed pickup to Finish in the fighting. In late May heavy fighting in Mogadishu left 60 people dead and over 100 wounded, most reportedly non-combatants, as militias of Muhammad Habib and Yalahow, both members of SRRC, attacked the house of Dahir Shaykh Dayah, the Interior Minister of TNG. The fighting had reportedly displaced thousands of families, particularly in north Mogadishu. Clashes between rivals again flared up in Mogadishu in July, ahead of the proposed peace talks in Nairobi, leaving 30 people dead and 50 wounded. Most of the victims were civilians caught in the crossfire or killed when artillery shells struck residential houses. The dead included many children. Renewed fighting was reported in Middle Shabelle, with 20 fatalities in related inter-clan clashes, and again resumed in early September, leaving 15 people dead and over 30 wounded in two days of fighting in north Mogadishu. Each of the two warlords then claimed to be the head of the USC/SSA and the leadership feud became the cause of further fighting in 2003.24 July 2002, AFP Transitional Federal Government (TFG) When the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was organized in 2004, Musa Sudi Yalahow was one of the 275 selected members of the Transitional Federal Parliament enumerated in the official list of August 29, 2004. His term expires in 2009. On March 20, 2005, it was reported Yalahow was arrested in Kenya, along with other TFG members of parliament for brawling over an argument which stemmed from the debate over whether to allow peacekeepers from Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya to help restore the TFG to power. Yalahow's militia is based in Mogadishu and he partly controls the lucrative Daynile Airport, which is northeast of Mogadishu. The airport is a source of income as international aid agencies use it as well as people who are importing or smuggling goods into the capital. In October 2005, the Somali Transitional Federal Government ordered that Daynile be closed. Yalahow, though a Minister in the government, warned that he would shoot down any plane which followed the government's orders not to land there. Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (ARPCT) In February 2006 Yahalow joined the United States-backed warlord coalition, the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (ARPCT) in order to fight the Islamic Court Union. Fighting between the ICU and ARPCT claimed more than 350 lives and Yalahow's militia occupied the International Red Cross and Red Crescent (ICRC)-run Kensaney hospital. The ICRC issued a statement that the hospital was taken by Yalahow's fighters, despite repeated calls by the ICRC) and the Somali Red Crescent Society for medical facilities to be spared, that the hospital was clearly marked with the red crescent emblem and that the military operation impeded the access of new casualties to the hospital. Keysaney hospital was the only medical facility in Mogadishu North offering surgical services for the war-wounded at the time. The Somali Justice Advocacy Center called on the United Nations (U.N.) to bring Yalahow to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for violation of the 48 and 51(5) (b) of additional protocol of deliberate prevention of wounded civilians from receiving medical assistance, the indiscriminate shelling of civilian populations and the complete take over of Keysani Hospital. Somalia is not a party to the court, and therefore would have to consent or be referred by the UN Security Council in order for the court to have jurisdiction. In June 2006 the regional body IGAD threatened to do this to warlords it termed \\"spoilers\\". (See also: Cases before the International Criminal Court) On June 5 Yalahow withdrew from Mogadishu to the warlord stronghold of Balad, a town 30 km north of Mogadishu, which was also taken by the ICU days later. The Somali Prime Minister, Ali Mohammed Ghedi removed Yalahow from office, saying Yalahow had opposed his government and peace initiatives and undermined their reconciliation activities. He said Yalahow's actions fueled violence and unrest and his militia had killed innocent civilians. Return to Mogadishu On January 6, 2007 YALAHOW returned to Mogadishu from exile.fr.news.yahoo.com On January 12, 2007, the same day as the Battle of Ras Kamboni ended marking the last major campaign to defeat the ICU, Somali warlords tentatively agreed with President Abdullahi Yusuf to disarm their militias and to direct their members to apply to join the national army or police forces. An estimated 20,000 militia were said to exist throughout Somalia. Mohamed Qanyare Afrah said the clans were \\"fed up\\" with militias and agreed to disarm his own men. Muse Sudi Yalahow was less conciliatory and made veiled threats that if dissatisfied, people might oppose the government. On January 16, 2007, Mohamed QANYARE Afrah and Mouse SUDI YALAHOW were the first warlords of Mogadishu to disarm, turning over their weapons and committing their militiamen to the government, though some of SUDI's arms remained in other locations controlled by QANYARE and Mohamed DHERE. The arms were accepted by the chief commander of the government army, along with GENERAL Naji and other dignitaries.

However, there have been concerns regarding allegations of police brutality, mistreatment of the Romani minority, government corruption, poor prison conditions, and compromised judicial independence. Romania was ranked 59th out of 167 countries in the 2015 Democracy Index and is described as a \\"flawed democracy\\", similar to other countries in Central or Eastern Europe. Corruption and institutional abuses Corruption in Romania is a serious systemic problem, according to the anti-corruption report of the EC. Although the anti-corruption struggle has seen an upward trend in recent years, and the investigations of the National Anticorruption Directorate (NAD) have led to a former prime minister's trial in 2015 and other important public representatives, corruption still affects many aspects of life. The US Department of State's report on human rights practices highlights that bribes has remained an ordinary thing in the public sector. Romania and Bulgaria are the only EU members monitored through the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification. The MCV was established at the time Romania joined the European Union in 2007 to remedy the shortcomings of judicial reform and the fight against corruption. Although there have been significant improvements, corruption remains an issue, affecting many areas of life. Despite the fact that Romanian law and regulations contain provisions intended to prevent corruption, enforcement has generally been weak until recently. The image of Romania was badly affected by the 2012 political crisis, when the European Commission expressed concerns about the rule of law. The Commission also criticised Romania for failing to root out corruption and political influence in its state institutions. The 2017 Romanian protests were massive public protests against government plans of decriminalizing certain forms of corruption. Police brutality is also a problem. The Romanian Police was demilitarized in 2002, and has been reorganized, in order to modernize it and rid it of former abusive practices inherited from the communist era. However problems, such as police brutality, are reported to persist. According to the US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, NGOs and the media reported that \\"police mistreated and abused prisoners, pretrial detainees, gypsies, and other citizens, primarily through use of excessive force including beatings\\". Prison conditions are another problem: in 2017, the ECHR ruled that detention conditions in Romanian prisons are in breach of European Convention of Human Rights. Freedom of the press The government has been accused at times of restricting freedom of the press. Journalists who wrote reports critical of government policies and actions have claimed they were targets for harassment and intimidation during the 2004 Romanian presidential election. Romania was ranked 46th out of 178 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2017 World Press Freedom Index; another report by Freedom House describes the Romanian press as \\"partly free\\". Human trafficking There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe (see main article: Human trafficking in Romania). The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution.default Romania is a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Romanian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticized for failing to fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The new Romanian Criminal Code, which came into force on 1 February 2014, creates several offenses against slavery, human trafficking, child trafficking, pimping, forced labour, and using exploited persons (Art. 182 Exploitation of a person, Art. 209 Slavery, Art. 210 Trafficking in human beings, Art. 211 Trafficking in underage persons, Art. 212 Pressing into forced or compulsory labor, Art. 213 Pandering, Art. 214 Exploitation of beggary, Art. 216 Use of an exploited person‚Äôs services). Romania has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; and is also a party to the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Children's rights Children's rights are protected by several laws; and Romania also has international obligations due to the conventions it has ratified. Children have equal rights, regardless of whether they were born inside or outside of marriage. This is stipulated in the Romanian Constitution, at Art. 48 (3) which states \\"Children born out of wedlock are equal before the law with those born in wedlock\\"; and also by Art. 260 of the civil code. In addition, Romania ratified The European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock, and, therefore, it is bound to ensure that children born outside marriage are provided with legal rights as stipulated in the text of this Convention. The [272/2004] Law on the protection and promotion of the rights of the child, republished in 2014 is an important law dealing with children's rights. According to the new criminal code which came into force on 1 February 2014, Article 197 titled Ill treatments applied to underage persons outlaws child abuse. The general age of consent in Romania is 15. Romania has also ratified the Lanzarote Convention. As a European Union member, it is also subject to the EU's Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. With regard to the right to education of children, parents/legal guardians are obligated to ensure the child gets an education; failure to do so can result in criminal prosecution (Art. 380 Preventing access to compulsory public education). Parents/legal guardians have an obligation to ensure that their children do not engage in undesirable behaviors. For example, according to Art 33 of Law No. 61/1991 penalising the violation of public order and social standards, parents/legal guardians who fail to take \\"adequate measures\\" to prevent children under 16 from engaging in vagrancy, begging, or prostitution are liable to pay a contraventional fine (Law No. 61/1991 on contraventions applies only in cases when the deed of the guilty party does not constitute a criminal offense). The US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices reports that some children, particularly from the Roma ethnicity, were not registered (although birth registration is mandatory under the law). Under the new Civil Code of Romania which came into force in October 2011, the general marriageable age is set at 18, but can be lowered to 16 under special circumstances, with authorization from the district's administrative board. (Art 272 Marriageable age). Law nr. 288/2007 increased girls' marriageable age, bringing it in line with that of boys; prior to this law, girls could, in special cases, get married at 15, and as a general rule at 16. Romania is a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Women's rights Women's rights is Romania are subject to constitutional provisions and internal laws. Romania is also bound by directives of the European Union, and international conventions it has ratified. The Constitution of Romania protects women's rights. Article 4 (2) enshrines the principle of non-discrimination, stating that: \\"Romania is the common and indivisible homeland of all its citizens, without any discrimination on account of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, religion, sex, opinion, political adherence, property or social origin\\". Art 48 (1) ensures equal rights in family law: \\"The family is founded on the freely consented marriage of the spouses, their full equality [...].\\" The rights of women in the workforce are also protected: Article 47 (2) reads: \\"Citizens have the right to pensions, paid maternity leave [...]\\" and Article 41 states: (2) \\"All employees have the right to measures of social protection. These concern employees' safety and health, working conditions for women and young people [...]\\" and (4) \\"On equal work with men, women shall get equal wages.\\" With regard to the new civil code, relevant provisions include Art. 30 Equality in front of the civil law and Art. 258 The Family (freely given consent for marriage; equality of the spouses). In 2016, Romania ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention). Anti-discrimination laws Romania has many laws banning discrimination. The problems in the country are not rooted in lack of legislation, as Romania has a strong de jure framework, but in the lack of enforcement of the existing laws - often due to bureaucracy, corruption, and social norms. The most important anti- discrimination laws are: *Ordinance no. 137 of 31 August 2000 republished (law on preventing and sanctioning all forms of discrimination) *Law no. 202 of 19 April 2002 republished (law on equality of opportunity and treatment between men and women) In addition to these laws specifically created to deal with discrimination, articles banning discrimination can also be found in many general laws, which deal with general aspects of life, and also contain specific articles banning discrimination in that area (e.g. Law no. 188 of 8 December 1999 republished [law on the status of civil servants], the Labour Code of 24 January 2003, the Law on National Education no.1/2011, etc.). Furthermore, discrimination is also addressed in the Criminal Code, art Art. 297 (2) which reads:\\"The same punishment applies to the action of a public servant who, while exercising their professional responsibilities, limits the exercise of a right of a person or creates for the latter a situation of inferiority on grounds of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, religion, sex, sexual orientation, political membership, wealth, age, disability, chronic non-transmissible disease or HIV/AIDS infection\\". Domestic violence Domestic violence is serious problem in Romania. Although Romania has improved its legislative framework in the 21st century, and also ratified the Istanbul Convention in 2016, violence against women occurring in the private sphere remains an issue. Romania was convicted by the ECHR in 2017 for its failure to act. Right to education Romania has been criticized for its failure to enforce the right to education of certain social groups, namely rural children and Roma children, notwithstanding the fact education in Romania is compulsory until the 10th grade (usually corresponding to age 16 or 17). Segregation of Roma children in schools, which is illegal, continues unofficially in some schools, and in 2017 the NGOs ERRC and Romani CRISS urged the European Commission to launch an investigation into the segregation of Roma children in schools. The access of children who live in rural areas to education is another area of concern: their situation becomes very problematic after the eighth grade (the last grade of middle school/gymnasium corresponding to age 14-15) because children must change schools to go to high school, and many villages do not have high schools, and therefore parents must make arrangements for their children to commute to the nearest locality or for the child to move there, which is difficult, and as a result many children abandon school (despite the fact that education is compulsory until tenth grade). In one study, a third of rural school children said they planned to drop out of school after eighth grade. Background of human rights in Romania Romania at the turn of the 20th century was a very progressive country and had strong human rights roots: it was, for instance, one of only seven countries in Europe to have abolished the death penalty during peacetime.Adams, Robert. The Abuses of Punishment, p.150. Macmillan (1998), . However the image of Romania was later tarnished internationally by severe violations of human rights during successive dictatorship systems: that of Ion Antonescu during World War II; and the following communist Romania regime which included executions of political 'enemies' in the 1950s, and later on, the infamous natalist policy of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, with its resulting abuse of unwanted children in Romanian orphanages, as well as the extreme control of everyday life through practices such as phone bugging, and other abuses of the communist Securitate. Human rights improved greatly after the Romanian Revolution.

There are approximately 7CIA Factbook million Catholics in Guatemala, which is about 47% of the total population of 15, 800,000 citizens. History Introduction of Protestantism Historically, Guatemala has been predominantly Catholic. Beginning in 1959, after Fidel Castro began the Cuban Revolution, the Holy See became increasingly aware of the number of Protestant missionaries traveling to Latin America. Following this realization, several Catholic priests and missionaries traveled to Latin America to increase the number of priests and baptized Latinos. Over the past few decades, Protestantism has grown throughout the area. Guatemala currently contains the largest number of Protestants (approximately 40%) than any other Latin American country. The largest Protestant denominations present in Guatemala today are Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Lutherans, Baptists, and Episcopalians. Protestants first began to arrive in Guatemala in 1882 as a result of President Rufino Barrios desire to challenge the power of the Catholic Church. He invited several Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist missionaries, but only when Pentecostal missionaries arrived from the United States did Guatemala see an influx in Protestant converts. Charismatic Catholicism Charismatic Catholics is a religious movement that has a set mind to increase the number of Catholic converts. Its members in Guatemala increase the numbers of Catholics in Latin America with the help of social organizations, missionaries, and clergy. In the mid twentieth century, Catholic Guatemalans feared that Catholicism would become the minority to Protestantism. Many Catholics began converting to Protestantism instead during this time period. Also, there were very few native Guatemalan priests because this job was mostly taken up by missionaries from the United States. The Charismatic Catholics bounced back with a large number of foreign missionaries, an increase in Guatemalan priests, and other lay revitalization within the Church as a whole. They believed that \\"the quest for identity was important and difficult\\" in the changing modern times. Status of Religious Freedom There is no state religion in Guatemala, however the Guatemalan Constitution recognizes the legitimacy of the Catholic Church. The constitution also recognizes freedom of religion to all of its citizens, and the government protects and honors this law. Although the Catholic Church is the only religion recognized by the Guatemalan Constitution, any other religious affiliation can file a copy of its bylaws and a list of its initial membership to the Ministry of Government in order to receive recognition. The only requirement of the Guatemalan government is that each religious affiliation register as legal entities if they want to participate in business of any kind. Applicants are rejected if \\"the organization does not appear to be devoted to a religious objective, appears to be in pursuit of illegal activities, or engages in activities that appear likely to threaten the public order.\\" San Andr√©s X√©cul Church San Andr√©s Xecul Catholic Church The San Andr√©s Xecul is a Catholic church in the Western Highland of Guatemala built in 1900. It is painted in baroque style architecture, and was restored in 2008. The outside walls of the church contain 200 painted sculptures of humans, angels, monkeys, fruit, corn, and birds of all different colors. These images are important to Mayan people who live in this region because it contains many agricultural images which symbolize this regions main source of economy. Also, the design of the outside of the San Andr√©s X√©cul is similar to the huipils worn by Guatemala women. Inside the church there are chandeliers made from glass stone, coins, rosary beads, candles, and other depictions and sculptures of Christ. Turmoil in Guatemala Social Discrimination and Disputes There have been several disputes between Catholics and the indigenous Mayan people. Many Catholic churches had been built on ancient Mayan sites during the Spanish colonization of the Americas which has upset the Mayan people not only because it is their land, but because several Catholic priests do not allow the Mayan people to access this land at all. Also, many Evangelical Protestants refuse to converse about any topics. Representatives from Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, and Mayan spirituality meets every two-three months out of the year at the Interreligious Dialogue at the Foro Guatemala to discuss several select topics such as social and political issues. Also, beginning in the 1960s, Catholic bishops and priests have joined together to work with indigenous Mayan people to create a basis of local leadership, improve health and education, and also organize cooperatives. Revolution and Disaster During the 1960s, revolutionary upheaval began in Guatemala City. After the armed movement was put down by the Guatemalan Army, the movement came back stronger than before. It was now called the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, and began an insurgency campaign against the government: the Guatemalan military adopted scorched earth tactics and started killing hundreds of thousands of indigenous Mayan peasants in the western highlands. During the 1960s, the Catholic Church in Guatemala was suppressed by anti-communist Guatemalan governments, due to suspected Marxist sympathies.https://www.pewforum.org/2006/10/05/historical- overview-of-pentecostalism-in-guatemala/ Lower Catholic orders were also targeted by the military, as they were seen as subversive and instrumental in the spread of liberation theology. Guatemala again experienced more destruction in 1976 when an earthquake took the lives of 20,000 people and injured 80,000 more.

Peter and Paul in Ulaanbaatar The Catholic Church in Mongolia is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. There are around 1,300 Catholics in the country who are served by three churches in the capital Ulaanbaatar plus churches in Darkhan, Arvaikheer, Erdenet and mission stations that may grow into churches. Catholicism was first introduced in the 13th century during the Mongol empire, but died out with the demise of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368. New missionary activity only set in after the Second Opium War in the mid-19th century. A mission was founded for Outer Mongolia, giving Mongolia its first Catholic jurisdiction, but all work ceased within a year when a communist regime came to power. With the introduction of democracy in 1991, Catholic missionaries returned and rebuilt the church from scratch. As of 2016, there is an Apostolic Prefecture, a bishop, six churches, and diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Mongolia since 4 April 1992. History Christianity in Mongolia has ancient roots. Nestorianism had been practiced since the 7th century, and in the 13th century Western missionaries such as William Rubruck and Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Armenian King Hethum I visited the region. The leaders of the Mongol Empire were traditionally tolerant of many religions, though Christianity was a key religious influence, primarily through the wives of the Mongolian khans - women from the Church of the East Keraites. John of Montecorvino was a key missionary to Mongol-controlled China during the Yuan Dynasty, translating the New Testament and the Psalms into the Mongol tongue, founding the first Catholic mission in Beijing and becoming its first bishop. Technically Mongolia had been covered by the Diocese of Peking, and it was not until 1840, when a Vicariate Apostolic was divided from Beijing, that Mongolia had its own Catholic jurisdiction. In 1883, a vicariate for Inner Mongolia was created and then a mission was created for Outer Mongolia in 1922. Freedom of thought and religion were not permitted under communist rule. Mission sui iuris (1991-2003) The new Mongolian Constitution of 1992 guaranteed religious liberty, and missionaries were sent to reconstitute the Church. Missionhurst (the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) sent priests Fathers Wenceslao Padilla, Gilbert Sales and Robert Goessens to accomplish this mission once the Vatican had established diplomatic relations with Mongolia. Prior to their arrival, expatriates had been attending Protestant services. Initially, none of the missionaries knew Mongolian, none of the native peoples knew English, and there were no Catholic liturgical texts printed in Mongolian. The first Masses were held in rented apartments and consisted of foreigners working for embassies and foreign aid organizations. By 1996, Father Wenceslao Padilla and 150 parishioners were on hand at the dedication of the first Catholic Church in Mongolian history. In 1997 the first papal nuncio to Mongolia from the Holy See was named. The new Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Ulaanbaatar is shaped like a traditional ger, with its circular tent shape and walls of thick felt. Fr Wenceslao Padilla was consecrated as the first Bishop of Mongolia on 29 August, 2003 in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Ulaanbaatar. Prefecture Apostolic (2003-present) On 23 August 2003, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe (head of the Vatican Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples) arrived and consecrated Father Padilla as the first bishop of Mongolia, although the country is not yet a diocese. Pope John Paul II apologized for being unable to attend the opening himself, as he had been planning to visit Mongolia, a first for a pope. He had originally been invited by the President of Mongolia during his visit to the Vatican in 2000. There are now 54 missionaries from various countries helping to build up the Church, and 3 functioning parishes. The arrival of numerous Christian missionaries has been notable since the fall of communism, and Catholicism grew from no adherents in 1991 to over 600 in 2006, including about 350 native Mongolians. A Mongolian version of the Catholic catechism was printed in mid-2004. It is done in traditional Mongolian writing style and includes common Catholic prayers. The mission runs a kindergarten, English classes, a technical school, soup kitchens, two farms, and a care center for 120 disabled children. Another course offered is how to deal with anger management, in order to help uproot domestic violence. The Verbist Center has taken in 120 street children who had previously been living in Ulaanbaatar's sewer system. Christmas is not a national holiday in Mongolia, as the proportion of the population that is Christian is very low. A fourth parish was founded in 2007 in Darkhan, Mongolia's second-largest city. The first Catholic grotto in Mongolia was dedicated in 2008. Joseph Enkh Baatar became the first Mongolian Catholic to join a seminary for the priesthood in 2008. He was ordained as the first Mongolian deacon in December 2014, and as the first Mongolian priest on 27 August 2016. More than 1,500 people attended the ordination Mass, including nearly 100 priests from South Korea, dignitaries of foreign embassies, those from local Orthodox churches, and Buddhist monks. As of 2016 there were three seminarians for Mongolia studying in Daejeon, South Korea. Bishop Wenceslao Padilla died on 25 September, 2018 after twenty-six years of service in Mongolia, fifteen of them as bishop. As of October 2018, no announcement had been made by Pope Francis of a new bishop for Mongolia. Legal restrictions People under the age of 16 can only receive catechesis with written parental consent and professions of faith are only allowed in church buildings. Priests may not dress in clerical clothing in public.

The pound was the currency of Pennsylvania until 1793. It was created as a response to the global economic downturn caused by the collapse of the South Sea Company.The American Weekly Mercury 2(54), The Colonial Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (December 27, 1720). (2009-05-18)https://books.google.com/books?id=7IfQAAAAMAAJ. Initially, the British pound and certain foreign coins circulated, supplemented from 1723 by local paper money, called Colonial Scrip. Although these notes were denominated in pounds, shillings and pence, they were worth less than sterling, with 1 Pennsylvanian shilling equalling 9 pence sterling. The Pennsylvania Pound was first conceived by Francis Rawle,Francis Rawle, ‚ÄúRestoring the Sunk Credit of the Province of Pennsylvania with Some Remarks on its Trade.,‚Äù Early American Imprints, Series I: Evans, 1639-1800(2287), p. 6, Readex: A Division of News- Bank, Philadelphia (1721). who can be rightly called The Father of the Pennsylvania Pound.Borawski, Thomas,\\"From Pennsylvania Pounds to Surveillance Money, The Bailout Debate of 1722\\", In March 1723, it issued Colonial Scrip, paper bills of credit to the amount of $60,000, made them a legal tender in all payments on pain of confiscating the debt or forfeiting the commodity, imposed sufficient penalties on all persons who presumed to make any bargain or sale on cheaper terms in case of being paid in gold or silver, and provided for the gradual reduction of the bills by enacting that one-eighth of the principal, as well as the whole interest, should be paid annually. Pennsylvania made no loans but on land security or plate deposited in the loan office, and obliged borrowers to pay 5% for the sums they took up. The scheme worked so well that, in the latter end of the year, the government emitted bills to the amount of $150,000 on the same terms. In 1729 there was a new emission of $150,000 to be reduced one- sixteenth a year. Pennsylvania was one of the last colonies that emitted a paper currency. In 1775, the Colonial \\"Scrip\\" currency was replaced by Continental currency. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania issued Continental currency denominated in ¬£sd and Spanish dollars, with 1 dollar equalling 7 shillings and 6 pence.

This session followed the Sejms of 1764 to 1766, where the newly elected King of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, attempted with some successes to push through reforms to strengthen the government of the Commonwealth. These reforms were viewed as dangerous by Poland's neighbors, who preferred a weak Commonwealth and did not want to see it threaten their own political and military aspirations. The Russian Empire sent ambassador Nikolai Repnin, who became the driving force behind the Sejm proceedings. The Repnin Sejm marked one of the important milestones in increasing Polish dependence on the Russian Empire, and turning it into a Russian protectorate. This dependent position was bluntly spelled out in Nikita Ivanovich Panin's letter to King Poniatowski, in which he made it clear that Poland was now in the Russian sphere of influence.  History  The Ambassador of the Russian Empire to Warsaw Prince Nikolai Repnin received orders from Russian Empress Catherine the Great to bribe and coerce the Sejm deputies in order to push legislation favourable to Russia, in effect \\"a carefully drafted plan for destroying the republic\\". At that time Poland had a population of about 11.5 million, out of which about 1 million were non-Catholics. In his preparations Repnin fostered unrest among the religious minorities ‚Äì Protestants (mostly in Royal Prussia and Greater Poland) and Eastern Orthodox (mostly in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), who wanted to have equal rights with the Roman Catholics. Repnin was well aware that a Catholic-dominated Sejm would be strongly opposed to such demands. He also calculated that such a demand itself would make the szlachta suspicious of all reform, including the recent reforms of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski and his supporters from the magnate Czartoryski family. Repnin's calculations were proven correct at the Sejm of 1766, which not only rejected the dissident bill, but repealed all of Poniatowski's reforms. This weakened the position of King Poniatowski. Supporters of the previous King Augustus III of Poland from the Electorate of Saxony, led by Gabriel Podoski, started a campaign to dethrone the king. In order to further Russian goals, Repnin encouraged the formation of two Protestant konfederacjas of S≈Çuck and Toru≈Ñ and later, Catholic (Radom Confederation, led by Karol Stanis≈Çaw \\"Panie Kochanku\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç). The first act of the Radom Confederation was to send a delegation to Saint Petersburg, petitioning Catherine to guarantee the liberties of the Republic, and allow the proper legislation to be settled by the Russian ambassador at Warsaw. With Russian troops sent to \\"protect\\" the various pro-Russian factions and this carte blanche in his pocket, Repnin proceeded to treat the deputies of the Sejm as if they were already servants of the Russian empress. The opposition was headed by four bishops: Bishop of Lw√≥w Wac≈Çaw Hieronim Sierakowski (1699‚Äì1784), Bishop of Che≈Çm Feliks Turski (1729‚Äì1800), Bishop of Cracow Kajetan So≈Çtyk (1715‚Äì1788), and Bishop of Kiev J√≥zef Andrzej Za≈Çuski (1702‚Äì1774). To break the opposition, Repnin ordered the arrest of four vocal opponents of his policies in the Polish capital, namely bishops J√≥zef Andrzej Za≈Çuski and Kajetan So≈Çtyk and hetman Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski with his son Seweryn. All of them members of the Senate of Poland, they were arrested by Russian troops on October 13, 1767 and imprisoned in Kaluga for 5 years. Through the Polish nobles that he bribed (like Gabriel Podoski, Primate of Poland) or threatened by the presence of over 10,000 Russian soldiers in Warsaw and even in the very chambers of the parliament, Repnin, despite some misgivings about the methods he was ordered to employ, de facto dictated the terms of that Sejm. The intimidated Sejm, which met in October 1767 and adjourned till February 1768, appointed a commission (the so-called Delegated Sejm) which drafted a Polish‚ÄìRussian treaty, approved in a \\"silent session\\" (without debate) on February 27, 1768. The legislation undid some of the reforms of 1764 under King Poniatowski and pushed through legislation which ensured that the political system of the Commonwealth would be ineffective and easily controlled by its foreign neighbours. The liberum veto, wolna elekcja (free election), neminem captivabimus, rights to form the confederation and rokosz -- in other words, all the important privileges of the Golden Liberty, which made the Commonwealth so ungovernable -- were guaranteed as unalterable parts in the Cardinal Laws. The Sejm, however, also passed some more beneficial reforms. Russia, which had used the pretext of increased religious freedoms for the Protestant and Orthodox Christians to destabilize the Commonwealth in the first place, now had to push those reforms through the Sejm to save face. Thus the legislation of the Sejm granted those religious minorities the same status as that of the previously dominant Roman Catholics, and some privileges of the Catholic clergy were limited. In addition, the penalty for killing a peasant was increased from a fine to the death, liberum veto was abolished on sejmiks (local parliaments), and a mint was created. All those reforms were guaranteed by the Russian Empress, Catherine II. The resulting reaction among Poland's Roman Catholic leadership to the laws granting privileges to the Protestants, as well as the deep resentment of Russia's meddling in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the Bar Confederation (1768‚Äì1772), directed against Poniatowski and Russia, which ended with Russian victory and the First Partition of Poland.

Owing to the Italian Renaissance, church art in Italy is extraordinary, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Fra Carnevale, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian, Raphael, and Giotto, etc. Italian church architecture is equally spectacular and historically important to Western culture, notably St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Cathedral of St. Mark's in Venice, and Brunelleschi's Florence Cathedral, which includes the \\"Gates of Paradise\\" doors at the Baptistery by Lorenzo Ghiberti. History St Peter's Basilica and Vatican City, in Rome Christianity arrived on the Italian peninsula in the first century, probably by unknown travelers, traders or soldiers. The Letter to the Romans of Paul the Apostle is addressed and attests to the presence of Roman Christians in the first century. Christians in Rome were also in touch with St. Peter and St. Paul the Apostle, both of whom went to Rome on mission and were eventually martyred there. One of the first Italian bishops and popes was Clement of Rome who wrote a letter to the Christian community in Corinth (1 Clement) around AD 96. Over its two thousand-year history, the Church of Italy grew in size and influence producing and harboring (sometimes before martyrdom) some of the greatest leaders and movers of Catholic Christianity including Priscilla and Aquila; Ignatius of Antioch, martyred in Rome; Polycarp, martyred in Rome and a disciple of John the Evangelist; Agnes, Roman martyr; Lawrence, martyr; Justin Martyr, teacher and martyr; Hippolytus, priest and martyr; Cecilia, Roman martyr; Ambrose of Milan, bishop and Doctor of the Church; Jerome, theologian and Doctor of the Church; Benedict of Nursia, founder of the Benedictine order and of Western monasticism; Leo the Great, bishop of Rome and Doctor of the Church; Gregory the Great, bishop of Rome and Doctor of the Church; Augustine of Canterbury, Roman monk, Benedictine missionary to England, later English bishop; Urban II, pope or Bishop of Rome who called for the First Crusade; Anselm of Canterbury, Italian-born philosopher, Doctor of the Church and later English bishop; Francis of Assisi, mystic and founder of the Franciscans; Bonaventure of Bagnorea, Franciscan theologian and Doctor of the Church; Thomas Aquinas, Dominican theologian, philosopher, and Doctor of the Church; Dante, poet; Catherine of Siena, mystic, reformer, and Doctor of the Church; Monteverdi, composer; Robert Bellarmine of Tuscany, Jesuit theologian and Doctor of the Church; Antonio Vivaldi, priest and composer; Leo XIII, bishop of Rome and social reformer; Pius XII, bishop of Rome; John XXIII, bishop of Rome and initiator of Second Vatican Council, among many others. One could add to this list the founders of various contemporary lay ecclesial movements, notably Luigi Giussani, founder of Communion And Liberation, and Chiara Lubich, founder of the Focolare Movement. Also, Andrea Riccardi, founder of the Community of Sant'Egidio, now one of the great faith based organizations in the world. Today Around 80% of the Italian population is Catholic. Italy has 225 dioceses and archdioceses, more than any other country in the world with the exception of Brazil. It also has the largest number of parishes (25,694), female (102,089) and male (23,719) religious, and priests (44,906 including secular (i.e. diocesan) and religious (those belonging to a male religious institute)). The bishops in Italy make up the Conferenza Episcopale Italiana as a collaborative body to perform certain functions specified by Canon Law. Unlike most episcopal conferences, the president of the Italian conference is appointed by the pope, is his capacity as Primate of Italy. Since May 2017, the president of the episcopal conference has been Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti. Organization Map of the 16 Italian ecclesiastical regions The Primate of Italy is the Bishop of Rome, who is also ex officio Pope of the Catholic Church. The Apostolic Nuncio to Italy is also the nuncio to San Marino; the incumbent is Italian Archbishop Giuseppe Bertello, who has held the office since January 2007. There are two Catholic particular churches in Italy: * The Latin Church (absolute majority, uses Roman rite except in the Archdiocese of Milan where Ambrosian rite is used). * The very small Italo- Albanian Catholic Church (one of Eastern Catholic Churches, uses Byzantine rite) divided into Territorial Abbacy of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata, Eparchy of Lungro and Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi. The Latin Church in Italy is organized into: * 16 ecclesiastical regions (corresponding to the regions of Italy, with some consolidations). ** 42 ecclesiastical provinces divided into: *** 1 apostolic see (Diocese of Rome). *** 1 patriarchal see (Patriarchate of Venice). *** 40 metropolitan archdioceses. *** 20 archdioceses. *** 155 dioceses (see: List of Catholic dioceses in Italy). *** 2 territorial prelatures: Territorial Prelature of Loreto and Territorial Prelature of Pompei. *** 6 territorial abbeys: Monte Oliveto Maggiore, Montecassino, Montevergine, Santa Maria di Grottaferrata, La Trinit√† della Cava and Subiaco. *** 1 military ordinariate: Military Ordinariate in Italy.

The film also co-stars Jerry Springer, Shakara Ledard, Thomas Lockyer and Caroline Lee Johnson. The film was released on direct-to-video in the United States on October 18, 2005. Dolph Lundgren plays Lance Rockford, who must set aside his values and patriotism to protect the life of the world's greatest terrorist so that he doesn't become a martyr for his cause. Plot The global war on terror rages on. The United States will not give an inch against terrorists, especially Mohamed Jamar (Geoffrey Burton), who is considered to be the worst of them all. Jamar has been missing for months, but his network continues its functions. The President (Jerry Springer) stands firm before the world, but behind the scenes, his teams are working to find the final solution. Jamar represents a paradox: he can never be killed, because if he was found dead, he would become an instant martyr. If caught he must be tried. If he is found guilty he would become a martyr and further inspiration to acts of terror. If acquitted, the policies of the entire western world would be destroyed. So he must remain invisible. Roberta Jones (Caroline Lee Johnson), the head of the National Security Agency, is working to ensure he remains invisible, forever. Under the guise of attending an Eastern European conference on Terror in Romania, she attends a secret meeting with Jamar at a secluded hotel outside Bucharest. No one knows about this meeting, and her goal is to buy his invisibility. Her only companions are her security team of six, headed by her personal bodyguard, Lance Rockford (Dolph Lundgren). They are the best of the best, former military special forces personnel capable of anything. When they arrive at the hotel for the secret meeting, they are ambushed. No one is supposed to know about the meeting, but someone wants it stopped. They have to fight for their lives against an unknown attacker. Lance, a man of highest integrity with an impressive record of service for his country, is forced into a situation which challenges his very beliefs. Throughout the crisis, it is revealed that Jamar and his loyal bodyguard were actually undercover agents from the Central Intelligence Agency and MI5 who have uncovered evidence against high-ranking military officials involved in a conspiracy to topple the President to continue war profiteering, and Rockford's trusted agent, Kaye (Shakara Ledard) was the mole involved in the conspiracy. With all of the members of the team, as well as the undercover agents dead, a wounded Lance kills Kaye with a thrown combat knife. The conspiracy is toppled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as military police, while Lance voluntarily leaves his bodyguard duties.

The town is bordered by its sister communities of San Antonio Este, to the east, and Las Grutas, to the southwest. Discovered by an expedition of the Spanish Empire in 1779, San Mat√≠as Gulf became the site of an outpost, San Antonio (so named in honor of St. Anthony of Padua). Water scarcity led the original settlement to fail in 1905, leading the community to settle west of the gulf, in what today is San Antonio Oeste. The arrival of the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway in its expansion towards Bariloche in 1910 led to the hamlet's growth. It later became the site of Punta Verde, the leading port for the large wool export industry of Patagonia, though the collapse in the wool market during the 1930s and 1940s led to the port's closure in 1944. Deep-water port of San Antonio Este San Antonio Oeste benefited afterwards from a growth in tourism in nearby Las Grutas, a scenic cove known for its grottoes.

History According to in the Romans, Christianity began in Spain when St. Paul went to Hispania to preach the gospel there after visiting the Romans along the way. After 410 AD, Spain was taken over by the Visigoths who had been converted to Arianism around 360. From the 5th to the 7th century, about thirty synods, were held at Toledo to regulate and standardise matters of discipline, decreed uniformity of liturgy throughout the kingdom. Medieval Spain was the scene of almost constant warfare between Islamic and Christian kingdoms. Islamic and Christian people generally lived in peaceful co-existence under Islamic rule such as in Al- Andalus with many instances of inter-religious marriage. However, there was tension from the Pope and the Catholic Church to oppose Islamic rule in Spain and to \\"reclaim\\" Europe. This was the period of the so-called \\"Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain\\". The Almohads, who had taken control of the Almoravids' Maghrebi and Andalusian territories by 1147, far surpassed the Almoravids in Islamic fundamentalism, and they notably treated the non-Islamic dhimmis harshly. Faced with the choice of death, conversion, or emigration, many Jews fled to North Africa and Egypt. The Reconquista was the long process by which the Catholics reconquered Spain from Islamic rule by 1492. The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 to complete the religious purification of the Iberian Peninsula. In the centuries that followed, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spanish missionaries carried Catholicism to the Americas and the Philippines, establishing various missions in the newly colonized lands. The missions served as a base for both administering colonies as well as spreading Christianity. The Catholic Church in Spain supported Franco in the Spanish Civil War and afterwards established a close relationship with the Spanish state, with many Catholic priests serving in the government. After Vatican II, the church suddenly reversed its position, withdrew its support for the Franco regime, and supported the separation of church and state.  Sites  Sagrada Familia in Barcelona The Spanish Church oversees one of the greatest repositories of religious architecture (and art) in the world, among them the outstanding cathedrals of Cordoba (a former mosque), Santiago de Compostela, Burgos, Le√≥n, Seville, Toledo and the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza. There are also magnificent monasteries like San Mill√°n and Silos in La Rioja, Monstserrat and Poblet in Catalonia, El Escorial and El Paular in Madrid, San Juan de los Reyes in Castile-La Mancha, the Abbey of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas in Castile and Leon, or churches like Sagrada Familia in Barcelona by Antoni Gaud√≠. Festivals and pilgrimages Holy Week Holy Week () in Spain attracts thousands of pilgrims and tourists alike. For centuries Holy Week has had a special significance in the church calendar in Spain, where early on Good Friday the darkened streets of dawn become the stage for solemn processions and celebrations that lead up to festivities of Easter Sunday. Fifty-eight processions (according to a 2008 guide) parallel the health and wealth of the city from the 16th and 17th centuries of its golden age to the French Invasion in the 18th century and finally to its rebirth today in the twentieth century. Despite church attendances falling, in common with the rest of Europe, the Easter processions are expanding, as many newly formed brotherhoods have asked for permission from bishops and other authorities to process during Holy Week.Brian Whelan, \\"Amid the smell of incense came the purple-hooded Nazarenes,\\" The Tablet, 22 March 2008, 16. Way of Saint James For over a thousand years, Europeans living north of the Alps have made their way to the closest place in Europe \\"where they could access the spiritual authority of an Apostle: Santiago de Compostela.\\".Kevin A. Codd, \\"El Camino Speaks,\\" America, 15 December 2003, 8. In 2007, for example, over 100,000 people walked to Santiago de Compostela alone. Statistics There are over 42 million baptized, covering about 92% of the total population. There are 70 dioceses and archdioceses. In spite of strong traditions, most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services. A study conducted in October 2006 by the Spanish Centre of Sociological ResearchCentre of Sociological Investigations shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 54% hardly ever or never go to church (except for wedding and funerals), 15% go to church some times a year, 10% some time per month and 19% every Sunday or multiple times per week. A huge majority of young Spaniards, including those who self-identify as Catholic, ignore the Church's stance on issues such as pre-marital sex, sexual orientation or contraception.Samuel Lowenberg, \\"Church Leaders Struggle to Hold On,\\" The New York Times 26 June 2005, 4. The total number of parish priests has shrunk from 24,300 in 1975 to 19,307 in 2005. Nuns also dropped 6.9% to 54,160 in the period 2000-2005 (though compared to the United States with nearly 70 million Catholics and only 44 thousand priests and 50 thousand nuns, it is not severe). According to the Eurobarometer 69 (2008), another independent source, only 3% of Spaniards consider religion as one of their three most important values, while the European mean is 7%.

Martoccio Macaroni Company, Hollywood also produced the ZERO bar, originally called the Double Zero when first released in 1920. In 1938, Hollywood moved to Centralia, Illinois. In 1967, the Martoccio family sold Hollywood Brands to Consolidated Foods, which later became Sara Lee. Fire destroyed the Centralia plant in 1980. Production of the PayDay bar continued with help from the L.S. Heath and Sons Company until a new facility could be constructed. In 1988, Hollywood Brands was acquired by the Leaf Candy Company, and then later became part of The Hershey Company in 1996 via its acquisition of Leaf North America. PayDay was named the #3 candy bar in the 2019 LA Times Candy Bar Power Rankings. Etymology PayDay got its name because the candy bar was launched on pay day at the company, Hollywood Candy Company. Product History Peanut-dense PayDay bars were introduced in 1932 when candy bars were often viewed as meal replacements. Variations of the classic PayDay have included a Honey-Roasted limited edition in 2003 and the PAYDAY PRO, a high protein energy bar, in 2005. For a promotion in 1989, PayDay candy bars each contained an individually wrapped nickel. PayDay has a long history of offering chocolate- covered bars in its product line. In the 1980s, when owned by Sara Lee, there was a chocolate-covered PayDay. The Hershey Company has produced a limited version of chocolate PayDay in 2006 and later the PayDay Chocolatey Avalanche in 2007, which was later discontinued.https://tiny.kitchen/chocolate-covered- payday- bars/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%20turns%20out%20that,That%2C%20too%2C%20was%20discontinued.

It connects a lower terminus at , two tram stops away from the Sz√©ll K√°lm√°n t√©r transport interchange, with an upper terminus at . The line is integrated into the city's public transport system as tram line number 60, is in length, and was opened in 1874. The railway is operated by BKV, who also operate the city's tram and metro lines. It runs throughout the year between the hours of 0500 and 2300. As a fully integrated part of Budapest's public transport system, standard tickets and passes can be used. The V√°rosmajor terminus is adjacent to the Budapest tram stop of the same name, whilst the Sz√©chenyihegy terminus is a walk from the similarly named terminus of the Budapest Childrens Railway.  History  The old Cog- wheel Railway in 1896 The Cog-wheel on the map of 1905 \\"Zahnradbahn\\" Since 1868 a horse tramway ran on schedule from the L√°nch√≠d to set in operation by the Budai K√∂z√∫ti Vasp√°lya T√°rsas√°g (~ Public Railway Society of Buda). Nikolaus Riggenbach (the designer of the Vitznau-Rigi railway, Europe's first rack railway that opened in 1871) and a colleague, as the representatives of the Internationale Gesellschaft f√ºr Bergbahnen, applied for the construction of a rack railway uphill from to . The building permit was issued on 3 July 1873, and construction of the line began immediately, thus enabling the service to start up in the following year. The first introductory vehicle ran from 4 p.m. on 24 June 1874, and regular traffic began on the following day. The whole line was of standard gauge, built according to Riggenbach's cog- wheel system, and was operated by steam locomotives pushing coaches uphill and hauling them downhill. The single track railway was 2.883 km (1.56 mi) long with a difference in height of . Successful operation of the cog-wheel railway raised the issue of extending the line. The plan was brought to fruition in 1890, when traffic started to , increasing the length of the line to . The municipal transportation company took over the railway in 1926. The new owners soon started to upgrade the line, by electrifying it using the same 550/600V DC system used by the city's trams, by adding new passing loops and replacing old trackage, and by providing better schedules. New were built by SLM and Ganz, and the modernised operation started in 1929. From July 2, 1929, the new electrically powered vehicles ran every 15 minutes. During and after World War II the line became very run down, and closure became a possibility. However this was averted, and in 1973 the line was completely rebuilt to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the merger of Buda, Pest and √ìbuda into Budapest. The track was renewed using the Strub cog-wheel system, the line voltage was increased to 1500V and new vehicles, built by SGP and BBC, introduced. The older trains last ran on 15 March 1973 and traffic using the new, and current, vehicles began on 20 August of the same year.  Future developments  The Urban and Suburban Transit Association (VEKE) is advocating that the line be extended in both directions (Normafa and Sz√©ll K√°lm√°n t√©r).

The Catholic Church in Somalia is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. Overview There are very few Catholics in Somalia, with only about one hundred practitioners as of 2004. The whole of the country forms a single diocese, the Diocese of Mogadishu. During the pre-independence period, there were, at its peak in 1950, 8,500 Catholics in the Diocese of8 Mogadishu (0.7% of the nation's population), almost all of whom were expatriate Italians. History Catholicism was introduced in Italian Somaliland in the late 19th century.Gresleri, G. Mogadiscio ed il Paese dei Somali: una identita negata. p. 45 Initially, it was only practiced by the few Italian immigrants in Mogadishu and the Shebelle River farmer areas, thanks to some missionaries of the Trinitarian Fathers.Lucia Ceci. \\"Il Vessillo e la Croce\\" (pp. 27-168) In 1895, the first 45 Bantu slaves were freed by the Italian colonial authorities under the administration of the chartered Catholic company Filonardi. The former were later converted to Catholicism. Massive emancipation and conversion of slaves in SomaliaTripodi, Paolo. The Colonial Legacy in Somalia. p. 65 only began after the anti-slavery activist Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti informed the Italian public about the local slave trade and the indifferent attitude of the Italian colonial government toward it.History of Somali Bantu After obtaining Jubaland from the British, the Italian colonial administration gave land to Italian settlers for the production of cash crops that would then be exported to Italy. Requiring labor to work these plantations, the Italian authorities attempted to recruit Bantu ex-slaves, singling out the latter community for this purpose. However, the Italians soon also had to resort to forced labor (essentially slavery) when they found that volunteers, many of whom found it more profitable to work as free yeoman, were not forthcoming.Catherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 87-88 This forced labor came from the Bantu populations that were settled along the Shebelle River, and not from the nomadic Somalis.David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.64 Slavery in southern Somalia lasted until early into the 20th century, when it was finally abolished by the Italian authorities in accordance with the Belgium protocol and with the Diocese of Mogadishu. After World War I, many Bantus, the descendants of former slaves, became Catholics.Photo of the Trinitarian missionaries' catholic school in Gelib They were principally concentrated in the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi and Genale plantations.Gresleri, G. Mogadiscio ed il Paese dei Somali: una identita negata. p.71 In 1928, a Catholic cathedral was built in Mogadishu by order of Cesare Maria De Vecchi, a catholic governor of \\"Somalia italiana\\" who promoted the \\"Missionari della Consolata\\" christianization of Somali people. The cathedral, the biggest in Africa in the 1920s and 1930s, was later destroyed during the civil war of the 1990s. The Bishop of Mogadishu Franco Filippini declared in 1940 that there were about 40,000 Somali Catholics due to the work of missionaries in the rural regions of Juba and Shebelle, but WWII damaged in an irreversibly way most of the catholic missions in Italian Somalia.Tripodi, Paolo. The Colonial Legacy in Somalia. p. 66 Most were somali Bantu, but some thousands were illegitimate sons of Italian soldiers and somali girls (who received Italian citizenship when baptized). In the 1950s Indro Montanelli wrote on Il Borghese that Italian Mogadishu in 1942 after the arrival of the British was an African capital where most of inhabitants were Catholics: he indicated that of the 90,000 inhabitants more than 40,000 were Italians, while inside the 50,000 Somalis there were nearly 7,000 Catholics (including the many illegitimate sons of Italian soldiers and Somali native girls who were baptized in order to get Italian identification). From this he concluded that nearly 3 out of 5 Mogadiscio inhabitants were Catholics.Montanelli wrote in the first Borghese editions; Since the end of the colonial period and the departure of the Italians, Catholicism has experienced a nearly complete disappearance in Somalia.Gresleri, G. Mogadiscio ed il Paese dei Somali: una identita negata. p.96 The Diocese of Mogadishu estimated that there were only 100 Catholics in Somalia in 2004, down from 8,500 practitioners in 1950 during the height of the colonial period.

Human rights are comprehensively guaranteed in Switzerland, one of Europe's oldest democracies. Together with other European states, Switzerland is often at or near the head in international civil liberties and political rights rankings.Freedom House 2005 Switzerland places human rights at the core of the nation's value system, as represented in the Federal Constitution and political model. Promotion of peace, mutual respect, equality and non-discrimination are central to the country's democratic election.FDFA Human Rights Strategy 2016-2019.. Switzerland is signatory to all relevant international human rights instruments. It is also the depositary state of the Geneva Conventions and the place where several human rights-related NGOs were established or headquartered, including the Red Cross. The United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Switzerland is a member and which it was instrumental in establishing,Swiss Hold out Hope for UN Human Rights Body has its seat in Geneva. Respect for human rights and the promotion of democracy is also one of the five official policy goals of Switzerland.FDFA Human Rights Strategy 2016-2019 International involvement Switzerland is party to and has significant influence in a number of international mechanisms that promote human rights. Human Rights Council The United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) was an initiative put forward by Switzerland in 2006 to replace the prior United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Since this time, Switzerland has continued to be an active member in all HRC promotion and enforcement internationally.Switzerland's third term on the Human Rights Council Switzerland's third period of membership has recently been approved, following improvements recommended as in the 2012 Universal Periodic ReviewPermanent Representative of Switzerland addresses President of the General Assembly (UPR), which included improving gender equality, youth justice provisions, minimising racial discriminationUNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. and combatting excessive use of force by law enforcement.2015 Report on Switzerland Human Rights In this most recent application to the United Nations, Switzerland deemed protection of human rights on an international level to be one of three main voluntary pledges. Abolishing the death penalty internationally, stricter punishment for human rights violations, combatting discrimination based on sexual orientation and protecting human rights defenders are all identified as key policy aims.Permanent Representative of Switzerland addresses President of the General Assembly. Expanding and strengthening the HRC and its powers is a high priority for Switzerland, with the promotion of universal respect for all human rights being embedded in the nation's constitution.Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, Article 54 This goal has also been documented in Switzerland's 2015 application to renew HRC membership, as the nation wishes to enhance the participation of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), train all nations on global governance of human rights, and establish support systems for poorer nations to be able to participate further in human rights discussions through financial assistance with delegate's stays in Geneva.Permanent Representative of Switzerland addresses President of the General Assembly. Treaties Switzerland has ratified many human rights treaties. These include the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is in complement to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Ratification Status of Treaties in Switzerland Domestic enforcement of human rights Despite any possible difficulties that can arise from the federal, canton nature of Switzerland as a State the country allows for any international treaty that is ratified immediately and automatically becomes enforceable as national law, without the need to individually assess and implement international mechanisms manually.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. This is useful in Switzerland's plight to increase the human rights standards of the country. The Federal Constitution of Switzerland lists dignity and equality as paramount, which is evident in the application of a number of federal legislations.Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, Articles 7-8 Human rights defenders Switzerland is a supporting nation of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, recognising the importance of the Defenders in the international application of human rights, and the pressures these individuals and groups put on states to improve their national commitment to human rights.Human Rights Defenders Switzerland has implemented and seeks to standardise the Swiss Guidelines on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in efforts to protect defenders internally and on rights- driven missions to other nation states.UN General Assembly Children's rights Switzerland ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1997 and has continued to enhance children's rights since. In 2011, the Federal Social Insurance Office began a program to protect youth from violence, and another for the education of and protection from the media. Complementary to this, nationwide organisations such as the Pro Juventute Foundation and the Swiss Foundation for Child Protection are active in working with victims of child abuse of many kinds. Internationally, Switzerland is signed to the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, which criminalises sexual acts against children in all of its signed countries.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. Regardless of the structural mechanisms in place, human rights reports still document high rates of child abuse in Switzerland. One children's hospital alone reported 450 instances of abuse during 2014, of which 33% was sexual abuse, 35% physical, and the remainder being psychological abuse and neglect.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 There have been minor improvements made within the scope of children's right protection since the second Swiss UPR from October 2012. These are mainly in relation to rights and regulations governing the punishment of child offenders, however, not in relation to the high statistics of abuse.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. Death penalty Switzerland completely abolished the capital punishment for all criminal actions in 1992. This is documented in the country's constitution, and the nation has since rallied for the universal abolition of capital punishment.Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, Article 10(1) Switzerland observes the right to life and human dignity as fundamental to human rights and aims to have the punishment universally condemned by 2025.Switzerland's Commitment to a World without Capital Punishment Switzerland is taking an active role in the abolishment, working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and introducing a World Day Against the Death Penalty on 10 October every year. The work with the United Nations also involves drafting of several resolutions, such as the moratorium on the death penalty, which was approved by the Human Rights Council in 2015, and is presented to the United Nations General Assembly every two years following Switzerland's support for the document in 2007.Switzerland's Commitment to a World without Capital Punishment The country also works with international organisations such as Death Penalty Project, International Commission Against the Death Penalty and the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, and has ratified treaties such as the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, Protocol No. 13 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Switzerland's Commitment to a World without Capital Punishment Anti-discrimination provisions Combating discrimination and promoting inclusion are one of the key ways Switzerland seeks to promote human rights domestically, as covered by Articles 1, 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex discrimination protection Switzerland's anti-discrimination provisions do not specifically protect the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender or intersex communities from discrimination to the same degree that it does racism.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 This is one of the few discrimination areas the nation requires improvement in, as put forward in Switzerland's application for a third term on the HRC.UN General Assembly The Swiss federation does legally allow for same-sex partnership and adoption of a child where one of the partners was already a legal guardian of the child prior to the relationship.Act on Registered Partnerships between Persons of the same sex, Switzerland. Racism Switzerland uses many large and small-scale methods and domestic and international instruments to prevent racism. Prohibition on ethnic and race-based discrimination is codified in the Swiss Criminal Code, and the nation was involved in, and party to, the resulting document from the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in 2009. On a community level, all police must pass an examination on human rights, ethics, and racism before being employed, and the Service for Combatting Racism provides support, education and financial assistance to projects seeking to eradicate discrimination of this type. The Service also provides an outline of remedies that are available at law for any occurrence of racism.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. Gender The drive for gender equality in Switzerland is evident within many legal instruments of the country. Article 8 of the Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation notes men and women to have equal rights in the realm of law, within family life, and in employment.Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, Article 8(3) Switzerland also is committed to international documents attempting to secure gender equality, such as the gender components of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as assisting both politically and financially in United Nations mechanisms hoping to achieve recognition of gender equality universally.FDFA Human Rights Strategy 2016-2019 Women were granted the right to vote in the first Swiss cantons in 1959, at the federal level only in 1971Women's Right to Vote and, after resistance, in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden in 1990 (despite Switzerland having ratified the European Convention on Human Rights 16 years earlier). In 2011, a number of national achievements in women's rights were celebrated. The year marked the 40th anniversary of federal women's suffrage, 30 years of constitutional-level provision for gender equality and 15 years of legislative provision for gender equality,UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. as observed within the Federal Act on Gender Equality.FRFA on the Federal Act for Gender Equality 1995 Switzerland has also ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and made several other nationwide legal provisions to ensure equality of gender is achieved. These include the Victims of Crime (Assistance) Act and establishing a Federal Office for Equality between Women and Men for training of public workers in relation to domestic violence incidents.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2.. The Swiss Criminal Code also has specific provisions that prohibit certain gender discriminatory acts, such as female genital mutilation and forced marriage.Swiss Criminal Code, Articles 124 and 181a respectively Persons with disabilities Around 17% of the Swiss population are said to have a disability. The Act on Equality for Persons with Disabilities aims to assist with employing disabled persons and deterring discrimination.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2. Prevention of torture The Swiss Constitution prohibits any behaviour of this nature. However, there have been many reports of excessive force and illegitimate treatment by police while making arrests. These instances have been dealt with through the criminal courts accordingly.2015 Report on Switzerland Human Rights Prison overcrowding has been an identified problem within Human Rights Reports of punishment in the past, with prisons exceeding capacity anywhere from 50 to 300 percent over the 2014 year. This is yet to be rectified. In 2013, there were 10 deaths of prisoners, including 2 suicides which have yet to be sufficiently investigated.2015 Report on Switzerland Human Rights The Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment became enforceable in 2009, shortly followed by a National Commission for the Prevention of Torture being established in 2010 by the Federal Council to ensure human rights were upheld.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2.. Justice The Swiss justice system is mainly governed by the Constitution, which requires judicial independence. There is a presumption of innocence, trials are public, and are free from undue delay. Switzerland presently lacks a nationwide Ombudsman or similar authority to review and respond to complaints.2015 Report on Switzerland Human Rights Refugees and asylum seekers Switzerland's nationwide asylum granting policy is currently enforced until September 2018, following a renewal in 2014. The policy requires asylum seekers to provide necessary documents or have a justifiable excuse for not having proper documentation, or risk not being granted asylum.2015 Report on Switzerland Human Rights The nation has been active under the Dublin 2 Regulation since 2008, allowing transfers of asylum seekers to and from other states that are signatory to the agreement. Emergency financial support may be gained by asylum seekers, and internal legislation, such as the Asylum Act, aligns Switzerland with the asylum requirements of the European Return Directive.UNGA Report Submitted in Accordance with Paragraph 5 of the Annex to HRC Resolution 16/2..

The school is one of the nine high schools in the Saint Paul Public School District and is the largest high school in the city of Saint Paul, with enrollment at approximately 1,908. The school was opened in 1926 as the second high school on the East Side, after Johnson Senior High School. Harding is part of the IB Diploma Programme. Harding is a member of the Minnesota State High School League and the athletic teams compete in the Saint Paul City Conference.  Education  Harding Senior High School's Third Street entrance Harding Senior High School was one of several schools participating in smaller learning communities. In a somewhat similar fashion to specific colleges within the University of Minnesota, smaller learning communities were implemented in the 2002‚Äì2003 school year to group students that had similar interests together for a career. Freshmen were automatically placed in the 9th Grade Academy, and the following year, select to be in the Academy of Fine Arts, the Medical and Environmental Sciences Academy (MESA), the Human Services Academy, or the Science, Engineering, & Information Technology Academy (SEIT). However, the Academies have been facing difficulties with the large student body and change has been slow. While academic performance has improved over the past few years, there was not enough data to associate the increase with smaller learning communities. There was a limit of 500 students per academy, which presented a dilemma with the Academy of Fine Arts who have had to reject a number of students. A possible cause is the large base of students involved in some form of fine arts. Another challenge is scheduling students to just their academy teachers. In 2009 the music listening team made up of Matt Howard, Maivboon Vang, and Colton Moyer, took home a second-place finish at the state competition, this was after placing first in sections. The previous year Matt Howard, Connie Sinks, and Colton Moyer, took second in sections and advanced to state. The state placing team of 2009 was featured in the Star Tribune.

Electives   Athletics  View of Bakken Field, used by the Harding football, soccer, and track teams. Harding's athletic program offers several sports. The girls badminton team have dominated the sport in the decade of 20002009, winning eight state titles (2000, 2002‚Äì2004, 2006‚Äì2009) in ten years and becoming the first school to win four consecutive team titles. No other Harding sport has won a state title. In the spring of 2005, freshman Sade Pollard won state titles in the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes. In 2006, she swept all of the sprinting events, taking home state titles in the 100m, 200m and 400m runs. She was the only competitor from Harding to participate in the state meet that year, but scored enough points to give Harding a third-place finish in the state tournament. Pollard won the 200m and 400m dashes again in the 2007 state meet. In the spring of 2002, Sheila Emms broke the Minnesota single season record for strikeouts as a high school fastpitch softball pitcher. During her final season as a Harding Knight she struck out a staggering 353 batters and pitched seven perfect games. Following her high school career she was offered a full tuition scholarship to pitch for Illinois State University.

The date was continuously pushed back due to a number of problems between different developers, financial backers and the local council.Croydon Guardian: Work on Park Place delayed, 7 May 2008. It was cancelled in 2009, as other schemes began progress, such as the extension to Centrale and the possible takeover of the Whitgift Centre by Westfield Group. Park Place was part of the Croydon Vision 2020 re-generation scheme. Park Place has been proposed by developers Minerva plc and was given planning approval in 2000 by Croydon Council after which the Government Office for London decided not to proceed with a call-in in 2003, despite concerns over traffic and the impact upon existing retail. This decision, ultimately by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, caused controversy in 2006 amidst the Cash for Peerages political scandal, when it emerged that two of Minerva's previous and current chairmen, Sir David Garrard and Andrew Rosenfeld, had made major loans to the Labour Party three months before the decision not to call in the planning application. Prescott denied any wrongdoing. In May 2009, Croydon Council announced that it would be ending the development agreement with Minerva following a realisation that they would not be able to secure funding after Lend Lease pulled out of the project. Plans Minerva planned to build a shopping centre, office accommodation and bus station on the site of the Allders department store and St George's Walk. The scheduled commencement date for Park Place was originally Autumn 2006. Gap, John Lewis, Habitat and Borders expressed their desire to have a store in the centre, with an Apple Store another potential buyer of a unit. It was intended that the centre when completed would be , with the development adjoining and integrating with the existing Whitgift Centre at its northern end and extend south to Katherine Street. The overall site would have taken in part of Park Street and cross the western end of George Street via a bridge and tunnel with the existing Grade II listed frontages in George Street, as well as the North End facade of Allders to be retained. A compulsory purchase order by Croydon Council is in the process of being enacted to enable the whole site to come under the ownership of Minerva. A major new department store will be located to the south of the new site; originally this was to be a new Allders store, then owned by Minerva, but John Lewis was then lined up to anchor the site. On 5 May 2006 John Lewis announced that no development scheme in Croydon met their requirements and that they were not in negotiations with Minerva. This has boosted the chances of the newco 'Allders (Croydon) Ltd' being able to secure anchor status in the new development if it is pursued. Nestl√©, whose UK headquarters in the Nestl√© Tower form part of the site, plan to take part of the office accommodation. The development will create a new 'piazza' on Croydon High Street. There are proposals to alter Queen's Gardens with updated planting, an ice rink, a performance space and an entrance into Park Place. Viability The overall viability of the Minerva plans (1.08 million sq.ft. shopping centre) was thrown into doubt following the building of the 1.615 million sq.ft. Westfield London shopping centre development in west London (White City) which opened in October 2008 and the existing shopping development at Bluewater to the south-east of London. On completion of the centre, Croydon will have approximately . of space in its three shopping centres. On 19 March Minerva announced that their deal with Lend Lease had collapsed.Croydon Guardian: http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/localnews/display.var.2132827.0.park_place_development_set_to_collapse.php Lend Lease were responsible for negotiations with John Lewis. In May 2008, Croydon Council announced that they did not expect works to start until late 2009, a further delay of some 18 months.

The manuscript is regarded as one of the most important manuscripts of medieval Bulgarian culture, and has been described as \\"the most celebrated work of art produced in Bulgaria before it fell to the Turks in 1393\\".McKendrick, 56 The manuscript, now in the British Library (Add. MS 39627), contains the text of the Four Gospels illustrated with 366 miniatures and consists of 286 parchment folios, 33 by 24.3 cm in size, later paginated with pencil. The language of the text is variously described as Bulgarian,Dimitrova, 23 Middle Bulgarian, Slavonic,British Library Manuscripts Catalogue entry and Church Slavonic.Milner-Gulland, 304 Contents and binding The magic square on f.273v The book contains the four Gospels and some other texts, so is a true gospel book rather than an evangeliary, but there are markings showing which passages were to be read in the liturgy, as well as a list at the end of the book. The bookbinding of red leather over wooden boards is original, but the elements of a metalwork treasure binding probably decorated with gold, gems and pearls on top of this have disappeared. The nail holes where these were fixed on are evident, but it would not have covered all the binding, even on the front, as the leather is stamped with patterns and a griffin.Dimitrova, 63-64 The last gathering, with ff. 276‚Äì284, is a later insertion with a smaller page size, containing a menology or liturgical calendar of feast days and the appropriate gospel readings for them, and a synaxaria or calendar listing saint's feast days. There is also a short guide on studying the scriptures.Dimitrova, 63 Before this, at the end of the original book on f. 273v, is a magic square of a grid with 625 squares containing letters, in which the name of the book, as \\"Io Alexander Tsarya Tetravaggel\\" is spelled out several times, a unique feature in such a manuscript. The centre square contains the \\"I·ø∂\\" from which all readings begin.Dimitrova, 26-27 Folio 74, which probably contained a miniature illustrating the Last Judgment, has been cut and stolen in modern times. Miniatures The gospels are very heavily illuminated by the standards of the West European Late Middle Ages, following Byzantine traditions, going back to Early Byzantine luxury manuscripts of the scriptures such as the Vienna Genesis. Most pages have small \\"frieze\\" images in a landscape format taking the width of the written page. These are interspersed in the text, with between none and three per page, the number and placement in the text depending on the story at that particular point. Other images are near- squares, with the text wrapping round them, and there are larger or whole page miniatures at a few key points. Several scenes are shown more than once as they appear in the different gospels.Milner-Gulland, 303 Many images contain more than one scene side by side, or sometimes one above the other. The images probably follow closely a lost Greek model, perhaps of the 11th or 12th century.McKendrick, 56; Milner-Gulland, 303 The miniatures are mostly very close to those in a Greek manuscript made in the 11th century in the Monastery of Stoudios, the largest in Constantinople (now in Paris as BnF, cod grec 74), and were probably very largely copied from this or another Byzantine exemplar in the same tradition.McKendrick, 56 The colophon, unusually, refers to but does not name the artists (in the plural) who worked on the book, and the hands of three main masters can be detected, as well as other less competent stretches which were probably the work of less experienced trainees. All would probably have been monks. The main master, responsible for the royal portrait and other major scenes on a larger scale, has been claimed to be very innovative in his technique, while a second master partly followed his style, and the third was more conservative.Dimitrova, 33-34 However non-Bulgarian historians regard the style as a somewhat conservative one which \\"adhered closely to Byzantine models\\".McKendrick, 56 According to Robin Milner-Gulland, \\"All the painters use saturated colours, relish picturesque details and confidently handle a linear, basically twelfth-century Byzantine manner that is distinctly archaic by the standards of the fourteenth century.\\"Milner- Gulland, 303 File:TetraevangeliaOfIvanAlexanderFol9.jpg|Folio 9; Matthew 2:3-7, Herod takes advice, and calls the Three Magi to him File:TetraevangeliaOfIvanAlexanderFol45.jpg|Folio 45; Matthew 14:15-31, the Feeding of the Five Thousand and Jesus Walking on the Water File:TetraevangeliaOfIvanAlexanderFol212v.jpg|Folio 212v; the end of Luke, with the Tsar and the (barefoot) evangelist File:TetraevangeliaOfIvanAlexanderFol10detail.jpg|Folio 10, detail - Nativity, with the Magi appearing twice The royal portraits Folio 2v, with the tsar's son-in-law and daughters Folios 2v and 3r have a famous double spread miniature of the Tsar, his second wife, and his five children from both marriages, with his son-in-law on the far left, all identified by inscriptions. All wear crowns, have halos, and carry sceptres, and above the Tsar and his wife a double Hand of God emerges from the cloud to bless them. But only the tsar and his eldest son, standing to the left of him, wear a form of the loros, the cloth strip embroidered with gold thread and studded with gems that was a key part of the imperial insignia of Byzantine emperors. From the previous century this had begun to be shown in imperial portraits of other Orthodox rulers, such those of Serbia, Georgia and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.Evans, 8 The face of the tsar is very carefully painted and clearly attempts a realistic likeness.McKendrick, 56; Dimitrova, 35-36; Milner- Gulland, 303 There are a number of other portraits of the tsar; at the end of each gospel he is shown at small size in an arcade with the evangelist, and he appears in a large scene of the Last Judgement. In the Paris Greek gospel book with similar images (see above) the equivalent images at the end of each gospel show the evangelist with the abbot.McKendrick, 56 History The text of the manuscript was all written by a monk named Simeon in 1355‚Äì1356 on the orders of Ivan Alexander, probably for use in his private chapel. Simeon gives his name in the colophon on f. 275.Dimitrova, 23 It is not certain whether Simeon also illuminated the Tetraevangelia or simply was a scribe and calligrapher, or indeed whether he devised the magic square. Probably at least three different artists worked on the miniatures, but as was usual no names are given. The handwriting of the manuscript shows definite similarity with that of the Manasses Chronicle (1344‚Äì1345), a product of the Tarnovo Literary School of the time. After the fall of Tarnovo to the Ottomans in 1393, the manuscript was transported to Moldavia possibly by a Bulgarian fugitive, marking the last time for nearly half a millennium it would be in its native Bulgaria. It spent a number of years there and was later bought on the orders and with the resources of Prince Alexander I of Moldavia (also a \\"John Alexander\\"), which is evidenced by a red-ink marginal note on folio 5. The later fate of the manuscript until its arrival in monastery of Agiou Pavlou (St Paul) on Mount Athos is uncertain, but the document was recorded as part of the monastery's collection in the 17th century.Dimitrova, 21 Prince Alexander in Moldavia The English traveller and collector Robert Curzon (later 14th Baron Zouche, 1810-1873), who visited the monastery in 1837, was given the Tetraevangelia as a present by the abbot. This was to his surprise and delight, according to his own account;the passage from Curzon's catalogue of his collection is quoted by Dimitrova, 22 Milner-Gulland describes it as \\"shamelessly cadged\\" from the abbot.Milner-Gulland, 302 This probably saved the manuscript from being destroyed by the fire that burnt down the monastery library in 1905. Curzon released an inventory of his collection of manuscripts in 1849, the first time the Tetraevangelia was presented to the academic world. Direct work with the original was, however, impossible, which caused speculation, supposition and rumours related to the manuscript. His son placed his collection on permanent loan in the British Museum in 1876, and after her death, his entire collection was given to the museum in 1917 by his daughter Darea, 16th Baroness Zouche (1860‚Äì1917), which enabled more detailed examination of the book. When the British Library was created in 1973, the manuscript was transferred to the British Library.Dimitrova, 21 In 2017 the manuscript has been added to UNESCO's Memory of the World register as a world heritage document.

Adams was born in 1586, at Wem, Shropshire, educated at Shrewsbury School and admitted as a sizar to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University in 1600. He received his BA in 1605‚Äì6, and became a draper in London. Civic career In 1640, he was elected as sheriff, giving up his business, and applying himself to public affairs. He then served as Master of the Drapers' Company, sat as an alderman on the City of London Corporation, and was president of St Thomas' Hospital, which he probably saved from ruin, by discovering the frauds of a dishonest steward. In 1645, he was elected Lord Mayor of the City of London, showing unusual disinterestedness, declining the financial advantages usually made by the sale of places which become vacant. His loyalty to Charles I was so well known that at the start of the English Civil War his house was searched by parliamentary supporters, hoping to find the king there. The next year he was committed to the Tower, and detained for some time. However, at length he became the oldest alderman upon the bench, and was consequently dignified with the honourable title of father of the city. Sir Thomas sat as an MP for London from 1654‚Äì1655 and 1656‚Äì1658. His affection for the king was such that during the exile of Charles II, he remitted him ¬£10,000.Equivalent to ¬£817,747.40 in 2005 using the retail price index according to www.measuringworth.com On the restoration of the King Sir Thomas, then 74 years of age, was deputed by the city to accompany General Monck to Breda in the Netherlands, to accompany the king home. For his services the king knighted him at the Hague; and soon after the restoration advanced him to the dignity of a baronet, on 13 June 1661. Later life In his latter years he was afflicted with kidney stones, which hastened his death. After his death a stone was taken from his body, weighing 25 ounces (1.5 lb, or 0.7 kg), which is preserved in a laboratory at Cambridge. He seemed perfectly prepared for death, often saying \\"Solum mihi superest sepulchrum\\" (\\"All my business is to fit me for the grave\\"). His funeral sermon was preached by Dr. Hardy, at St Katherine Cree Church, before his children and many of his relations. He was buried in a barrel vault excavated under the altar of St Mary and St Margaret Church, Sprowston, Norfolk, and a large marble monument was erected above it. His descendants enjoyed the title down to Sir Thomas Adams, the sixth baronet, who died a captain in the Royal Navy in 1770. Legacy Renowned as a public benefactor, in his lifetime Sir Thomas gave his house at Wem as a free-school (Thomas Adams School) to the town, and endowed it; he founded an Arabic professorship at Cambridge in 1643, and paid for the printing of the Gospels in Persian, and for sending them into the east. Despite suffering great losses in his estate, he left legacies to the poor of many parishes, to hospitals, and ministers' widows in his will. His title and Sprowston estate passed to his eldest son William (1634‚Äì1687). His second son Richard is remembered for a collection of verse. Sources * Chalmers, Alexander.

Founded in the late 17th century, it is also a visitor attraction with many historical buildings that has played a vital role in the history of Denmark as well as Copenhagen. The naval base used to occupy the entire area of Holmen, which was in fact created by a series of landfills to house it, but is now confined to its northernmost island of Nyholm. Holmen was for many years the base of command for the Danish Naval Flag and has through the times been called Nyholm (which is the name of one of the islands), the Navy's Base and Naval Station or Naval Base, Copenhagen. It was never actually named Naval Station Holmen (Fl√•destation Holmen), even though many people not in the Navy have used this name. For over 300 years, the facility at Holmen was Denmark's largest employer. Today the Navy only has a single institution left on Holmen. Since the 1990s, the area has been opened to the public.  History  Map of Holmen today Erik Menved was the first Danish King to establish a naval port in Copenhagen. Later, under the command of Valdemar Atterdag, the fleet was moved to Vordingborg, but Erik of Pommern moved it back to Copenhagen and King Hans built a shipyard in Copenhagen. Christian IV built a \\"war port\\" on Slotsholmen, but the harbour's basin has been filled since and is the site of the Royal Library today. The buildings around the harbour housed supplies for the Navy. As ships started to grow in size, the war port became too small, and the fleet moved to Bremerholm. Under Christian VI, a dock was established in 1739 at Christianshavn, close to where Strandgade (Beach Street) is today. This dock existed up to 1871 when it was taken over by Copenhagen's Harbor Control, and the docks were filled. The name Gammel Dok (Old Docks) still show where part of the Navy's shipyard was.  Nyholm  Since the city was growing, it was not practical to have the Navy Fleet stationed in the centre of the city. The ships were, of course, built out of wood and were fire hazards. The seamen on the ships simply threw their waste and trash directly into the harbor, which had a negative impact on the city's health. In 1680, a plan was made to move the fleet out of the city. Responsibility for the plan was given to Admiral Niels Juel. West of a sandbank called Revshalen, old ships were scuttled after being filled with stones. In 1685, a defence wall with seven bastions was built. The bastions still exist today, and in Carls and Wilhems Bastion, one can still see the original black powder depots. These depots are Holmen's oldest buildings, built in 1688 and 1690. The northern bastion was Charlotte Amalies Bastion, and north of this two cannon batteries were established, \\"Batteriet Quintus\\" and \\"Batteriet Neptunus\\". The latter's name came from the sunken ship which was the foundation for the battery. This battery was later renamed to \\"Christiani Sixti Batteri\\", or \\"Christian the Sixth's Battery\\", but is known today as \\"Batteriet Sixtus\\" or just \\"Sixtus\\". The sinking of ships continued, filled with mud from the harbor and the trash from Copenhagen's streets. In certain streets, there was over a meter of trash, so there was plenty to take. This is how the island given the name Nyholm was created. On Nyholm, the foundation for a new shipyard was created. The first ship which was set to sea from this shipyard was Dannebrog in 1692. This ship was blown up on October the 4th, 1710, in a battle against the Swedes in K√∏ge Bugt. Afterwards, the constructions of all large ships were moved to Nyholm, and on Gammelholm, only smaller ships were built. After 1692, several ships were built on Nyholm and in 1750, a Danish king, then Frederik V, wore a naval uniform for the first time in connection with the christening of a new ship. In 1807, following the Second Battle of Copenhagen, the English destroyed three ships within the shipyard at Nyholm, but even though these were poor times for the Navy, ship construction continued at Nyholm. The last ship to be launched from Nyholm was launched in 1918, after which ship construction and several other operations were moved to Frederiksholm, which was to the south. The shipyard was separated from the Navy and became a civilian operation with its own director.  Arsenal√∏en  Holmen's southernmost island is Arsenal√∏en, or Arsenal Island. While development on Nyholm was continuing, a little island by the name of Motzmanns Plads, just north of Christianshavn, was bought. Later it was renamed to Christiansholm. A new island was created, with landfill, just east of Christianholm, where a large arsenal was built and finished in 1770. Later, this island was named Arsenal√∏en and was expanded to the east. The King's Gate. The gate has recently been restored, but is still hidden behind Christiansholm. Originally, a main gate existed to Nyholm. Nyholm wasn't just a name for the northernmost island but was the name for the area used by the navy. Access to the area required sailing to Holmen. A ferry sailed to Christiansholm, where one went over a bridge to Arsenal√∏en. Here, one could go to Nyholm though a gate, which faced the canal between Arsenal√∏en and Christiansholm. The gate was called \\"The Kings Gate\\". It is not visited by many people anymore. This is because in the middle of the 19th century, Arsenal√∏en formed a land connection with Christianshavn, so a new main entrance was created to Holmen, the so-called Warf Bridge Guard, or V√¶rftsbrovagt. The ferry to Christiansholm stopped and the Kings Gate was no longer used.  Frederiksholm  Around 1750, dumping of dirt and fill created two small islands south of Nyholm, \\"Ballast√∏en\\" and \\"Anker√∏en\\", along with a larger island, \\"Lang√∏en\\". From Nyholm, a bridge was built to Ballast√∏en and from Ballast√∏en to Anker√∏en and from Anker√∏en to Lang√∏en. From Lang√∏en's southern end, a bridge was built to Arsenal√∏en. This happened in the later part of the 18th century. At this point, all of Holmen's islands were connected. East from Lang√∏en, an atoll was found called \\"Mudder√∏en\\"; the area between Mudder√∏en (including Mudder√∏en itself) and Lang√∏en was filled, and \\"Frederiksholm\\" was created. This area was supposed to become a residential area for Navy personnel, but this plan was never followed through. Instead, the area became a storage area for ship masts, along with a row of other buildings on the island. After the Gunboat War, slips were made for the storage of cannon ships. When Nyholm, as mentioned, was expanded together with Ballast√∏en and Anker√∏en to present day Nyholm, Anker√∏en and Ballast√∏en were replaced with Ballas√∏ and Anker√∏, which were created west of Frederiksholm.

Signed by Peyton Randolph and John Blair Jr.. The pound was the currency of Virginia until 1793. Initially, the British pound sterling circulated along with foreign currencies, supplemented from 1755 by local paper money.Newman, 2008, p. 437. Although these notes were denominated in pounds, shillings and pence, they were worth less than sterling, usually discounted so 1 Virginia shilling was equal to 9 British pence, while 1 British shilling was equal to 12 British pence. In British pounds, shillings and pence (¬£sd), duodecimal coinage (12d (pence) = 1s (shilling), 20s = ¬£1 (pound), 21s = 1 guinea), which was in use in the UK until the adoption of decimal coinage in 1971. In 1645 the legislature of the Colony of Virginia prohibited barter, and valued the Spanish dollar or piece of eight at 6 shillings. The 1655 legislature officially devalued the Spanish dollar to 5 shillings. The first \\"official\\" coinage in British North America was issued by the Province of Virginia in 1775, although they were dated 1773. The reason was that the Virginia House of Burgesses had been requesting the coinage for several years and King George III finally consented in that year. Five tons of coins were sent to the colony on the clipper ship Virginia and most of the coins were distributed just before the breakout of the American Revolution in April 1775. They are considered to be the most affordable Colonial American coinage. The State of Virginia issued Continental currency denominated in ¬£sd and Spanish dollars, with 1 dollar = 6 shillings. The continental currency was replaced by the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1000 continental dollars = 1 U.S. dollar. References Notes  Bibliography  *Newman, Eric P.

Biography Grindle was born in Toledo, Ohio. His parents, Ray and Edna, were a Vaudeville family act performing at the Paramount Theater in Toledo.Kiska, Tim & Golick, Ed (2010) Detroit Television, Arcadia Publishing, , p. 52 His brother, Kenny, was a tap dancer in the family act. One day they brought little Johnny up onstage to sing \\"Sonny Boy\\" and he was an instant hit. As a teen he performed stand-up comedy in clubs all over Toledo, Detroit, and Canada. Grindle had been working as a comedian under the name Jerry Gale when he auditioned to present a program for WXYZ-TV based around re-runs of The Three Stooges. Given the role, WXYZ vice president John Pival insisted that he work under the name Johnny Ginger, the name taken from a bottle of Johnny Bull Ginger Beer. Ginger's afternoon show, Curtain Time Theater (which was always pronounced \\"Thee-A-ter\\"), entertained kids from 1957 to 1960 on WXYZ-TV Channel 7.Castelnero, Gordon (2006) TV Land: Detroit, The University of Michigan Press, , p. 51-62 The live portions of the show were broadcast all around the television station, with Ginger in his janitor costume of bib-overalls and driving cap. By the early 1960s Johnny adapted a new character inspired by the Jerry Lewis film The Bellboy, that of the head bellboy at the Rocky Plaza Hotel, run by Rocky Granet (the voice of Rube Weiss), and the show became The Johnny Ginger Show. He introduced a new generation of kids to The Three Stooges and even played the part of Billy The Kid in the Stooges last film, The Outlaws Is Coming. As a gesture of gratitude, the Stooges used many of the children's hosts who had run their shorts in the cast. He, Ricky the Clown, Jingles, Poop-Deck Paul, Milky the Clown, Rube Weiss, Captain Jolly, Sagebush Shorty and Soupy Sales helped pioneer Detroit television for children in the fifties and sixties. The Johnny Ginger Show was cancelled in 1968. Ginger went on to host Captain Detroit for WKBD-TV. Johnny left Detroit for Hollywood and appeared on an episode of The Rifleman.

Alfred Jean Baptiste Lemaire composed this anthem in 1873 on the orders of Naser al-Din Shah. It had no lyrics. Sal√¢m-e Sh√¢h was played in official ceremonies during the reign of Naser al-Din Shah, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah and Mohammad Ali Shah. It was also played as Persian national anthem during Naser al-Din Shah‚Äôs and Mozaffar ad-Din Shah‚Äôs European tours. In 1909 after the fall of Mohammad Ali Shah, the anthem was abolished and after coronation of his son and successor Ahmad Shah in 1914, Salute of Sublime State of Persia was adopted as Persian national anthem.  Newer version by Melal orchestra (Ir√¢n-e Jav√¢n)  This anthem was rearranged, recomposed and orchestrated by the Iranian composer Siavash Beizai. Only the main parts of this hymn are derived from the original version. There are also some harmonic and formal corrections in this piece. The Introduction, the middle part, and the closing part are composed by Siavash Beizai too. After the great popularity of this Anthem, it has been increasingly misused by the official Iranian Radio and Television and the Government without any permission of the cocomposer Siavash Beizai.

It was an update of the BNC mount (short back-focus; Bausch & Lomb BALTARs, e.g., and equivalents) done to accommodate the reflex viewer in the later cameras. BNC mount lenses cannot be used in reflex Mitchell cameras as their shorter back-focus will hit and damage the reflex viewer, which, in various versions, was a pellicle (partially silvered) mirror or a (100-percent silvered, first surface) rotating mirror. The abbreviation stands for \\"Blimped Newsreel Camera Reflex\\", which meant that it is a 35 mm camera originally intended for news reporting but included a blimp housing for sound stage shooting plus a reflex viewer to allow the camera operator to view the action through the lens while filming. The reflex option was only added in 1967, while the blimp option (thereby converting an NC, \\"Newsreel Camera\\", into a BNC, \\"Blimped Newsreel Camera\\") was available at the camera's introduction in 1934, but only a few BNC examples were made before the onset of WW-II, during which manufacture of \\"production\\" cameras was suspended. The lens mount is not identical across all variants, thus there is a marked difference between a BNC and BNCR mount, for instance. BNCR is only the current convention as it was the last version of the camera and in relatively current use through until the 1990s. The mount contains four pronged flanges only one of which contains a notch towards the center. This notch is used to align the mount to a locating pin located approximately 45 degrees clockwise from the top of the camera's lens mount. This radial indexing is of particular importance when shooting an anamorphic format (CinemaScope or Panavision, or equivalent). The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring which, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. The quality of this design has been a key influence in the design of the Arri PL and Panavision PV mounts, both of which are the main film camera mounts in use today, and both of which have four-pronged flanges oriented based on locating pin-notch combinations. The Arri PL mount in particular is very similar in appearance to the BNCR mount, the only immediately apparent difference being the ability to seat any of the four notched prongs against the locating pin. (The flange focal distance and diameter also differ.) With the slow obsolescence of the Mitchell cameras, which likely took so long because they were so well regarded in mechanical design aspects, such as their steady intermittent movement registration (\\"Compensating Link\\" movement) and strong mounts, the mounts have gradually become less common in the past two decades, but remained an option for third party cameras produced as recently as the 1980s. Many of the cameras are still in usage in fields such as animation. Though the mount is not quite as common today, it is still very well regarded in the field.

It is located on the southwestern corner of Colombia, near the border with Ecuador, and enjoys of hot tropical climate. Tumaco is inhabited mainly by Afro-Colombians and some indigenous people. Tumaco is accessible by plane, from the western city of Cali, one of the main urban centers of the country, well connected to Bogot√°, the capital city. It can also be reached by land via highway from the city of Pasto, the capital city of the Nari√±o Department. Tumaco is known for being the hometown of many great Colombian soccer players, including Willington Ortiz. Colombian film director Samuel C√≥rdoba released a documentary about the city in 2009. The film, entitled \\"Tumaco Pac√≠fico\\", chronicles the stilt-house area of the city, predominantly populated by Afro-Colombians. C√≥rdoba was inspired by a panoramic photo of the stilt houses he saw in a photography book on Tumaco. The film won first place at the Festival de Cine Latinoamericano de Bordeaux, in France, and was presented at the Festival Internacional de Cine, in Santiago, Chile. Other places of interest include ecotourism sites and beaches located near the mouth of the Mira River, where the river meets the sea. Also, there are the Playas de Milagros (beaches of Miracles), and Bocananueva y Teran beaches, where visitors can experience the diversity of flora and fauna first-hand.

The wettest months are from January to June, and there is a rainfall trough in August opposite to northern Colombia. Economy Tumaco's location on the coast provides it with a number of maritime-related economic activities. A primary one is Agricultural production near Tumaco includes dry rice, palm oil and cacao. 35,000 hectares and seven extraction factories are dedicated to the production of palm oil. Family farms also grow cereals. Tourism has started to take on a more important significance in recent years. The city is nationally known for its music, producing football players, and its beaches.

It was launched in 1995 to the Astra 19.2¬∞E orbital slot initially to provide digital television and radio for DTH across Europe. Astra 1E was the first Astra satellite to be dedicated to digital TV broadcasting and it carried many of the first digital TV channels from networks broadcasting to France, Germany, and other European countries in the 1990s. The satellite originally provided two broadcast beams, of horizontal and vertical polarisation, for FSS (10.70-10.95 GHz) and for BSS (11.70-12.10 GHz) frequency bands. The FSS beams provide footprints that cover essentially the same area of Europe ‚Äì northern, central and eastern Europe, including Spain and northern Italy ‚Äì while the BSS horizontal beam excludes Spain and extends further east, and the BSS vertical beam includes Spain and more of southern Italy but does not extend so far east. Within the footprints, TV signals are usually received with a 60‚Äì80 cm dish. In October 2007, following the successful deployment of Astra 1L at 19.2¬∞E, Astra 1E was moved to Astra's new DTH orbital position, 23.5¬∞E where it provided capacity for the transmission of new services including the ASTRA2Connect two-way satellite broadband Internet service which provides high speed internet access and VOIP without landline connection at up to 2 Mbit/s download speeds and 128 kbit/s uploadSES ASTRA ‚ÄúASTRA2Connect Broadband and VoIP‚Äù (August, 2008).

Kocis was murdered at his Dallas Township, Pennsylvania home on January 24, 2007; arson was used in an attempt to disguise the circumstances of his death. Two escorts, Harlow Cuadra and Joseph Kerekes, were charged and convicted for Kocis' murder and subsequently given a sentence of life imprisonment without any possibility of parole. Early life Bryan Charles Kocis was raised in Larksville, Pennsylvania, the first son of Michael and Joyce Kocis. He graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology, after which he worked as a medical photographer for a local eye doctor. Career After he left the medical photography business, he tried several business ventures, all of which failed. In 2001, he was involved in a cellular phone venture. After being charged with sexual assault on a 15-year- old boy, he was removed as a partner in that venture, and established Cobra Video, also in 2001. Later that year, Kocis filed for bankruptcy in federal court. Kocis created two legal entities with the name \\"Cobra Video LLC\\": one in Pennsylvania in 2002, the other in Delaware in 2005. Cobra competed in the market niche of low-budget, Barely Legal-style bareback films. The company was dedicated to \\"Capturing the Erotic Essence of Youth\\" by producing pornographic movies of young men who looked as if they could be adolescents having sex without condoms. In the five years after, between his bankruptcy and his death, Kocis' Cobra Video did very well financially. At the time of his death, Kocis had amassed personal possessions which included a Maserati convertible, a BMW sport utility vehicle and an Aston Martin car. In addition to his Dallas Township home, Kocis owned two adjacent Rice Township parcels of land, valued at over $400,000, with no mortgages. Controversies Allegations of sexual abuse of a child In 2002, police found a videotape of Bryan Kocis, then 39, and a 15-year-old male in his home. Kocis pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse of a child. He was charged with child pornography, and transportation of a minor for sexual purposes. Since the boy had lied about his age Kocis was given a probation sentence. In 2006 a judge, Michael Conahan, signed paperwork changing Kocis' charge from sex assault to corruption of minors. Kocis' former attorney, Al Flora, said the change was made because the original charge of sexual assault of a child was a mistake and that, \\"We didn't realize there was an error until 2006.\\" As a result of that change, Kocis was not required to be registered as a Megan's Law offender. Conahan later pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges in relation to the infamous \\"Kids for Cash\\" scandal, and is serving 17.5 years in prison. Brent Corrigan Beginning in early 2004, Kocis cast Sean Lockhart, in Cobra's Every Poolboy's Dream under the stage name \\"Brent Corrigan\\". He starred in several more films in that year, notably Schoolboy Crush in 2004, in Bareboned Twinks and Casting Couch 4 in 2005, and other releases in 2006. On September 13, 2005, Corrigan's attorney announced that Corrigan was underaged when he filmed scenes for Cobra Video, and had used a fake ID to participate in those scenes. Cobra denied that it was ever aware of such allegations and publicly stated that it had copies of Corrigan's identity documents claiming a birth year of 1985. A civil lawsuit between the two parties began soon after. Kocis denied the allegations and began a counter- suit for copyright infringement, for the unauthorized use of Cobra's ‚ÄúBrent Corrigan‚Äù name. A final hearing in the matter was scheduled for February 21, 2007. In 2005 and 2006, Cobra removed six of the titles which featured Lockhart from store shelves, although they cited no reason for the removal. Death Kocis was found dead on January 24, 2007 at the age of 44, after a fire at his Dallas Township, Pennsylvania home. According to the investigating coroner, Kocis was stabbed 28 times and his throat was cut, nearly decapitating him. His body was left in the house before it was set on fire. Officials had to use dental records to identify Kocis because his body was burned beyond recognition. On May 15, 2007, two Virginia Beach escorts, Harlow Cuadra and Joseph Kerekes, were arrested and charged with Kocis' murder.

Popular culture Bryan Kocis' lawsuit against Sean Lockhart and the claim by Luzerne County (Pennsylvania) prosecutors during Harlow Cuadra's murder trial that Lockhart was \\"contractually bound\\" to perform sex acts for money for Bryan Kocis' Cobra Video company led to on- going public discussion about the legality of adult industry contracts and revealed why the adult entertainment industry in North America is concentrated in the State of California.

Despite years of environmental damage caused by heavy industries, transportation infrastructure, urban runoff and filling of wetlands, it is one of the most important biological sites in the Chicago region. Wolf Lake is located between Hammond, Indiana and the Hegewisch community area of Chicago, Illinois. It was once connected by an open channel to Lake Michigan on the Indiana side of the lake, but this channel was cut off for development on its northern side. Indianapolis Boulevard (U.S. 41) and various railroad and industrial facilities are located in former wetlands on the northeastern side of the lake where it once connected to Lake Michigan. There are currently proposals to reopen a channel between Wolf Lake and Lake Michigan. The Illinois portion of the lake consists of five, interconnected impoundments separated by dikes. The dikes were constructed in the late 1950s so that separate portions of the lake could be drained for the purpose of dredging for fill to use in the construction of the Chicago Skyway. The western impoundments are now part of the William W. Powers State Recreation Area and are drained by Indian Creek to the Calumet River. The Wolf Lake water level determines the drainage to Lake Michigan because the connecting Calumet River flows southward during elevated levels and northward during lowered levels. The Indiana portion of the lake consists of three, interconnected impoundments that are also separated by dikes. The longest dike, running roughly parallel to State Line Road and traversing the entire length of the lake, contains railroad tracks belonging to the Indiana Harbor Belt. The Indiana Toll Road (Interstate 90) runs through the middle of the lake just inside the Indiana state line. The lake is also transected by a number of railroad causeways, some of them no longer in use. Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad has an active spur line that runs through the Illinois side of the lake in the Hegewisch community area. Calumet Avenue (U.S. 41) is on its eastern side, with a strip of parkland in between. There are currently several large industrial properties adjacent to the lake and on filled wetlands adjoining the lake, including Cargill and Unilever on the north side. Other property near the edge of the lake is being used for housing. A significant portion of the property around the lake is now parkland or nature preserve, including the Eggers Woods parcel of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. Other neighboring lakes include Lake George, Lake Calumet, Powderhorn Lake and Lake Michigan. There was also another lake that lay to the west between Wolf Lake and the river. It was called Hyde Lake and was filled in by Republic Steel. A swampy area near 130th Street and the railroad tracks is the only remnant of that lake. History Wolf Lake in Illinois has a storied history that somehow has lost track of the origins of the name that goes back over 150 years. Part of this history includes visits by Abraham Lincoln in which Mary Todd Lincoln nearly drowned. In 1924, the body of Bobby Franks was found in a culvert just northwest of the lake. Franks was the victim of the so-called \\"thrill killers,\\" Leopold and Loeb ‚Äì the subjects of what was termed the \\"Trial of the Century.\\" It's well known that Chicagoland gangsters used to dispose of bodies in this lake system as well. From 1933 to 1936, Wolf Lake Speedway was located within the lake, in Hammond, Indiana.Kalwasinski, Stan. \\"Region Motor Sports: Hammond tracks part of racing's past\\", The Times of Northwest Indiana, July 17, 2014. Retrieved July 11, 2017. The track was completely surrounded by the water of Wolf Lake, and a portion of the lake was drained to allow for its construction.Dorsey, Kathleeen. \\"Wolf Lake\\", The Times of Northwest Indiana, July 30, 2014. Retrieved July 11, 2017. Nike Missile Site (C-44) During the Cold War, two areas around the lake were used to create Nike missile site C-44, part of an air defense system for Chicago and its heavy industries. It was one of many such sites that formed a ring of defense running from Indiana to Wisconsin. Both areas were decommissioned in the 1970s and have since been converted into preservation and recreation areas. On the northwest side of the lake, several hundred acres of wetlands were filled with ferrous slag in order to create the actual site for the missiles. This is currently Eggers Woods, part of the Cook County Forest Preserve system. The southwest side of the lake housed the site's radar station and has been converted into the William W. Powers State Recreation Area in Illinois. Ecology Wolf Lake, along with the other neighboring lakes, was once among the most biologically diverse places in the Midwest. Eighty years ago, the renowned naturalist Donald Culross Peattie described Wolf Lake as one of North America's preeminent natural areas, \\"‚Ä¶a famous hunting ground for aquatic wildlife...where the plants form one of the most remarkable assemblages of aquatics in the country...no body of water of equal size can boast such a list.\\"Rarities in the Rough, from Chicago Wilderness Magazine It is still an extremely unusual and diverse area. On August 23, 2002, more than 150 experts in botany, zoology and related ecological fields assembled at Wolf Lake and in the surrounding forest, prairie and marshland to identify and record as many living organisms as possible within a single 24-hour period. The purpose of this undertaking, known as the Calumet Bioblitz, was to document the extraordinary biodiversity of green pockets that have survived within the urban and industrial landscape south of Chicago. The water in Wolf Lake was about 18 inches higher until 1998 when the Illinois Department of Natural Resources removed several beavers and their dams that had been built across Indian Creek. The subsequent drop in water depth encouraged weed growth and changed fishing conditions. Beaver signs indicate that there are beavers on the lake currently. Fish Wolf Lake is home to the endangered Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and the threatened Banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus). Birds The lake and neighboring wetlands provide nesting sites for the endangered black-crowned night heron, little blue heron, yellow-crowned night heron and yellow-headed blackbird. Native Trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and Tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and non- native Mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all be found on the lake in winter. Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian Mute swans, which stay in the area year round, compete for habitat with the non-migrating Trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Flora The endangered false golden sedge (Carex garberi), little green sedge (Carex viridula) and the threatened marsh speedwell (Veronica scutellata) are plants that grow in the neighboring wetlands. Perhaps the most amazing biological aspect of the lake is its array of rare aquatic plants. Ecosystem restoration thumb A $7.25 million ecosystem restoration project for Wolf Lake was carried out by the Chicago District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with the support of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the City of Hammond. Completed in September 2007, the project sought to improve the overall quality of the lake ecosystem for native species. Natural water levels in the lake were restored by clearing channels and creating openings in dikes and causeways. Additional habitat was created by constructing approximately of new aquatic and wetland habitat plantings. Also, approximately of shoreline was restored, deep holes were created to locally diversify the lake bottom, and herbicidal and biological controls were implemented to control aquatic and shoreline exotic and undesirable plant species.USACE Chicago District While for many years it was commonplace for park visitors to feed the ducks and other birds that lived at the lake, this produced an unnaturally and unsustainably large population, as well as many non-native birds such as domesticated breeds of ducks and geese. It is no longer permitted that visitors feed wildlife and as a result the populations have dropped to a sustainable and natural population. See also * William W.

However, traditionally there are very strong ties of the Holy See with the only neighboring country of the Vatican City, Italy and also with the European Union. Since 1970 the European Union accredits an official representative from the Holy See (an Apostolic Nuncio) to the EU. Even though the Vatican City is not an official member of the European Union, it has adopted the Euro as its currency and has open borders with the Schengen Area.  Statements of the Holy See and other dignitaries of the Catholic church on the European integration  In 2016 Pope Francis was awarded with the Charlemagne prize. During his speech of thanks Pope Francis criticized a \\"crisis of solidarity\\" in Europe and condemned \\"national self-interest, renationalization and particularism\\". In December 2018 Cardinal Reinhard Marx, archbishop of Munich and Freising and former president of COMECE, called for a deeper European integration and condemned the harmful consequences of nationalism.  The Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe (CCEE)  The Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe () (CCEE) is a conference of the presidents of the 33 Roman Catholic episcopal conferences of Europe, the Archbishop of Luxembourg, the Archbishop of Monaco, Maronite Catholic Archeparch of Cyprus, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Chi≈üinƒÉu, the Ruthenian Catholic Eparch of Mukacheve, and the Apostolic Administrator of Estonia. The Secretariat is located in St. Gallen, Switzerland.  The Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community (COMECE)  The Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community (; COMECE) is the association of Catholic Church episcopal conferences in member states of the European Union (EU) which officially represents those episcopal conferences at EU institutions. bishops are delegated by Catholic episcopal conferences in EU member states and has a permanent Secretariat in Brussels, Belgium. It was established in 1980 and replaced the European Catholic Pastoral Information Service (SIPECA, 1976‚Äì1980). Discussions during the 1970s about creating an episcopal conferences' liaison organization to the European Community led to the decision, on the eve of the 1979 European Parliament election, to establish .

Vatican City and Rome According to the Catholic tradition, Saint Peter, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ and leader of the early church, was crucified and buried in Rome under Emperor Nero Augustus Caesar. On the place supposed to be the burial site of Saint Peter the Saint Peter's Basilica was built. Rome is also the residence city of the Pope, the leader of the Catholic Church, who at the same time is also the Bishop of Rome. Until today the Pope rules over an ecclesiastical state, the Vatican City, which encompasses 44 hectares of the city area. Rome hosts also the Papal Major basilicas. Besides the Saint Peter's Basilica there are three other Major basilicas: Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Santiago de Compostela One of the most important and famous sites for pilgrimages for the Catholic Church is Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. The cathedral of the city hosts the shrine of Saint James, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, and traditionally considered the first apostle to be martyred. Santiago de Compostela is the final destination of the Way of Saint James (Galician: O Cami√±o de Santiago). Assisi Assisi, a town in the Umbria region in Italy, hosts two more papal basilicas: the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi and the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli. The Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi is the mother church of the Order of Friars Minor, commonly known as the \\"Franciscan Order\\". Assisi is the town in which the founder of the order, Saint Francis, was born and died.

Initially, the morning edition was generally broadcast on the BBC Home Service at 10:30am, with the afternoon edition at 3pm on the Forces/General Forces Programme - and after the war on the BBC Light Programme. Between August 1942 and July 1945, a third edition was broadcast at 10:30pm for night-shift workers. The programme began in World War II with the idea that playing non-stop popular/light music at an even tempo would help factory workers become more productive. The programme originally consisted of live music (light orchestras, dance bands, brass and military bands and small instrumental ensembles). In order to make studios more available during the day, it was decided in 1963 that the shows would be pre-recorded (often in the evening or on Sundays). The programme began and ended with its theme tune, \\"Calling All Workers\\" by Eric Coates. Many combinations made hundreds of appearances, notably Troise and his Banjoliers, Cecil Norman and the Rhythm Players, Bernard Monshin and his Rio Tango Band, Anton and his Orchestra, Bill Savill and his Orchestra and Jack White and his Band. Although the programme became very popular with domestic audiences and later with motorists, it was aimed first and foremost at the factories, and strict rules were applied: predominantly familiar pieces, nothing lethargic, consistent volume, avoidance of overloud drumming (which could sound like gunfire), and generally cheerful programmes to which workers could whistle or sing. Jazz was discouraged as, by its very nature, it often deviates from the melody, which had to be clear at all times. The song \\"Deep in the Heart of Texas\\" was banned from the show, because of the potential danger of production line workers taking their hands away from their work or banging their spanners on the machinery to perform the four hand-claps in the chorus.'Radio Days' web siteWhirligig-TV page Music While You Work ended in 1967 when the BBC Light Programme transformed into BBC Radio 2. It was revived for a week to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary in October 1982 and then as a regular part of Radio 2 from January 1983 to January 1984. There were two short revivals in 1990 and 1991, and a final one-off programme in 1995. The concept of the programme was evoked during BBC Radio 3's \\"Light Fantastic\\" 2011 season with a live broadcast of light music from a factory in Irlam performed by the BBC Philharmonic, reminiscent of Music While You Work and Workers' Playtime.BBC Radio 3 \\"Light Fantastic\\" This one-off programme differed from the original series as it was staged before an audience and the items were announced.

It is also known as the Pink Tank because, in 1991, it was controversially painted pink, first by installation artist David ƒåern√Ω and a second time by members of parliament in protest at his arrest. The original location of the monument was .  The monument  The monument was erected in Kinsky Square (N√°mƒõst√≠ Kinsk√Ωch) in the Sm√≠chov district of Prague, and was dedicated on 29 July 1945, by Soviet General Ivan Konev and municipal representatives. The tank rested on a massive five-metre stone pedestal, its barrel pointing westwards. It was built to commemorate the arrival of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, namely the Fourth Tank Army led by Lelyushenko, on 9 May 1945, ending the German occupation of Prague. It was originally intended to represent Lt I. G. Goncharenko's T-34-85 medium tank of the 63rd Tank Brigade, the first tank to enter Prague in May 1945 and subsequently knocked out in the street fighting. However, the monument was an IS-2m heavy tank instead of a T-34, and its turret was labelled 23 whereas Goncharenko's tank had borne the tactical marking I-24.Zaloga 1996, pp 42‚Äì43, pl A2. Following the communist coup of 1948, the monument was elevated to the status of National Cultural Monument, commemorating the liberation of Prague by the Red Army, and the square was renamed Soviet Tank Square.  Controversy and removal  \\"Pink\\" Soviet tank \\"Joseph Stalin\\" formerly as No.23 now in Le≈°any military museum After the 1989 Velvet Revolution and the end of communist censorship, the legacy of the tank was openly discussed. For many citizens, the tank symbolised the Soviet occupation that ended the Prague Spring in 1968 and the subsequent permanent installation of Soviet military units, rather than the events of World War II. Popular local lore noted that the number 23 painted on the tank's turret was indicative of the year of the Soviet invasion (1945 + 23 = 1968). In February 1991, historian Pavel Bƒõlina argued that there were \\"neither moral nor historical grounds\\" for preserving the monument. The Pink Tank by ƒåern√Ω on the Vltava river, 24 June 2011 The Tank on the Vltava, showing the finger On the night of 27/28 April 1991, art student David ƒåern√Ω and friends painted the tank pink and erected a large finger suggesting an obscene gesture on its turret, signing the work \\"David ƒåern√Ω and the Neostunners\\". ƒåern√Ω was arrested under an often-abused law concerning \\"hooliganism\\", and after an official protest by the Soviet government, the tank was re-painted green in time for the anniversary. However, fifteen members of the newly elected parliaments from Civic Forum and Public Against Violence took advantage of their official immunity and painted the tank back to pink on 16 May in protest against ƒåern√Ω's arrest. The national monument status was abolished, ƒåern√Ω was released, and the tank was removed after being repeatedly being painted green, then pink again, a few more times. The tank is now located at Military Museum Le≈°any near T√Ωnec nad S√°zavou, about 20 kilometres south of Prague. On 17 October 2002, a fountain called Propadli≈°tƒõ ƒçasu (\\"Trapdoor of Time\\") was installed in the spot the tank formerly occupied. Pink tank hull with a white invasion stripe on Kinsky Square In 2004, a CowParade was held in Prague. One of the fibreglass cows was painted khaki by Roman T√Ωc and provided with five-pointed red stars and white numbers 23 on both flanks, with the intention to paint it pink later on. From May to September 2004, the cow named \\"Romeo 23\\" was placed on Kinsky square. On 8 July, one day before the planned happening when the cow was to be painted pink, two students cut the star and number from the Cow's side. ƒåern√Ω later proposed a new statue: a pink tank buried three-quarters in the ground. On 21 August 2008, the pink hull of a tank was unofficially installed on the spot. It has a white invasion stripe, the same as Soviet tanks that entered Czechoslovakia in 1968. According to ƒåern√Ω, the statue should draw attention to contemporary politics of Russia.Jana Z√°horkov√°, ‚Äúƒåern√Ω vr√°til Praze r≈Ø≈æov√Ω tank, tentokr√°t s okupaƒçn√≠m pruhem‚Äù, iDnes.cz, 21 August 2008.

The statue was finally installed at L√°znƒõ Bohdaneƒç, a spa resort where occupying Soviet troops were located until the early 1990s (location: ). On 20 June 2011, the Pink Tank temporarily returned to Prague as part of a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces.http://www.rp.pl/artykul/36,676835_Rozowy_czolg_wrocil_do_Pragi.html Its return included the erect middle finger, and the entire piece was placed on a barge on the Vltava river and displayed near the Charles Bridge until 1 July 2012.

In that role, TV signals could be received with a 50 cm dish across Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, most of Denmark, and in parts of France, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Reception was even possible as far afield as Scotland, Sweden and Serbia when a larger dish (around 110 cm) was used. In addition to contribution feeds and individual TV channels, Astra 3A carried pay-TV networks including Kabel Deutschland (Germany), CanalDigitaal (Netherlands), TV Vlaanderen (Belgium), CS Link (Slovakia and Czech Republic) and Skylink (Slovakia and Czech Republic). On 1 February 2012 Kabel Deutschland left Astra 3A and during 2012 other services were transferred off the satellite. As of October 2012, Astra 3A was in an inclined orbit at 23.7¬∞E with all services carried by the adjacent Astra 3B craft.

Cullen announced his retirement on 9 January 2015. He stated 'I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Dublin managers Tommy Lyons, Pillar Caffrey, Pat Gilroy and Jim Gavin and especially to all the Dublin players past and present that I had the pleasure of sharing the pitch with.' Cullen made his first appearance for the team during the 2003 championship and has become a regular player over the last few seasons. During that time he has won two All-Ireland winner's medals and six Leinster winner's medals. In 2011 Cullen captained the team to the All-Ireland title, beating Kerry in the final. At club level, Cullen plays with Skerries Harps. Cullen is also studying for a PhD at Dublin City University.\\"Boys in Blue bring Sam Maguire to DCU\\". DCU News. 23 September 2011. Playing career Inter-county At Minor level, Cullen was part of the Dublin side that won the 2001 Leinster Minor Football Championship. With the Dublin Under 21 team, he won the Leinster Under 21 Championship three times, and the All-Ireland Under 21 Championship once. His brother Graham was also on the All-Ireland Under 21 winning team. Cullen was called up to the Dublin Senior team in 2003, and made his League debut against Armagh in February 2003. He made his Championship debut later that year against Louth. In 2005, he won a Leinster Senior Football Championship medal with Dublin; defeating Laois in the final, with Cullen scoring three points. He scored eight points in total in that year's Leinster and All-Ireland Championships. Cullen was cited after the controversial 2006 National League clash between Dublin and Tyrone. A game in which resulted in disciplinary action being taken against nine players involved in the game. Cullen was suspended for four weeks in accordance with Rules 140 and 138, which deals with physical contact. Cullen along with Dublin's Ciar√°n Whelan, Alan Brogan and Kevin Bonner were all exonerated from all charges along with the Tyrone trio of Kevin Hughes, Michael McGee and Eoin Mulligan. The official reason given for the exoneration was stated as 'a technicality'. Owing to the regular Dublin captain Collie Moran's prolonged injury, Cullen captained Dublin to victory against Laois in the 2006 Leinster semi-final. He also captained the team for most of the 2006 Leinster final, although Moran made his long-awaited return to the Dublin team in time to deliver the winning speech. Dublins two captains stood shoulder to shoulder holding the Delaney Cup after an easy win over Offaly in the match. Cullen continued to captain Dublin against Westmeath in the All-Ireland quarter-final and Mayo in the semi-final despite Moran's return to fitness. Cullen was nominated for an All Star award in the half-back line for his 2006 performances. He missed out on the All Star, but was named half-back on the 2006 GPA Team of the Year. Cullen came on as a substitute in the 2007 O'Byrne Cup final against Laois at O'Connor Park in Offaly. Dublin won the game 1-18 to 2-13. The 2007 National League saw Dublin being relegated to Division 2. In that year's Championship, Dublin won the Leinster Championship again, before being knocked out of the All-Ireland Championship be Kerry at the semi-final stage. Cullen was on Dublin's 2008 O'Byrne Cup winning team - defeating Longford in the final. Later in the year, he won a fourth consecutive Leinster Championship medal with the county, before being beaten by Tyrone in the All-Ireland quarter-final stage. Cullen guided Dublin to victory as captain in their opening match of the 2011 Leinster Senior Football Championship against Laois. He scored a point in the game in what proved to be a facile win of 1-16 to 0-11 at Croke Park. Dublin advanced to face Kildare in the semi final of the Leinster championship. Dublin became won against the lilywhites with a controversial free in the dying minutes of the game. Cullen scored a point in the game and continued his unbeaten run in the championship as team captain in a game that finished on the scoreline 1-12 to 1-11. Cullen continued his trend of a point a game against Wexford in the Leinster final. Dublin won the 2011 Leinster senior football championship with a disappointing performance against a strong Wexford side. The game finished with James McCarthy's goal proving the difference between the sides. The game finished 2-12 to 1-12. In a repeat of the previous years quarter final, Dublin were drawn against Tyrone. Unlike last year, Dublin pulled off a hugely convincing victory over Tyrone with Diarmuid Connolly dominating the scoring and Cullen continuing his trend of a point a game. Dublin won the game by a margin of seven points with the Croke park clash ending 0-22 to 0-15. Dublin progressed to the semi final against a very defensive Donegal side. Cullen scored again and Dublin won the game in a low scoring affair ending sixteen years of absence from the all-Ireland final. The semi final against Donegal finished 0-08 to 0-06 and was a game that led to a final against a much fancied Kerry team. Cullen captained Dublin to all-Ireland victory at a packed Croke Park. With seven minutes remaining, Kerry were leading by four points and a victory looked all but certain for the Kingdom. Once substitute Kevin McManamon scored a goal for Dublin, it was clear that Dublin were not beaten. In the dying minutes of the game, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton kicked a free over the bar to give Dublin a dramatic victory against a stunned Kerry side. The game finished 1-12 to 1-11 giving Cullen the honour of being the first Dubliner to lift the Sam Maguire cup since 1995. Two years later, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton succeeded Cullen as Dublin captain in 2013.

It was later renamed Villeta because of its resemblance to a great Villa. INC Villeta's Port The port is administered by the National Administration for Navigation and Ports (ANNP), and is specially equipped for the handling of heavy machinery. Many different kinds of merchandise are traded through this port. Characteristics: * Villeta port terminal: 35 kilometers south from Asunci√≥n * Area: 13.5 hectares * Pier: 435 meters * Platform: 25 meters * Depth: minimum 10 feet, 365 days a year * Facilities: 6 hectares of beaches and paved roads * Covered warehouse: 0.3 hectares (100 X 30 meters) * Free zone: Bolivian governed, for merchandise in transit Climate The temperature in summer sometimes reaches 40¬∞C or higher. The minimum in winter is 0¬∞C. The average for the entire Central Department is 22¬∞C. The city is located in one of Paraguay's departments with the most rainfall during the months from January to April; and the least during the months from June to August. Church of Villeta Demography The total population of the city is 36,228 inhabitants, 18,362 males and 17,866 females, according to the data from the General Directorate of Statistics, Polls and Census. History Villeta was founded in 1714 by the Governor Juan Gregorio Baz√°n de Pedraza. During the government of Dr. Francia, the city became an important conduit for communication with other countries, making the economic development of the district possible. Historic building of Villeta 1921 known locally as the haunted house Economy Until 1930 the city was famous because of activity at the port, mostly the export of oranges. Today the port is used for multiple purposes. Villeta's port on the banks of the Paraguay River is the shipping point for most of Paraguay's exports. Nineteen large factories located in the area produce cement, iron rods, cotton, electric cables, and agricultural chemicals, and other activities. The cement and chemical plants are infamous for the environmental contamination they cause. The major processing plant for Paraguay's cement industry is located in Villeta. Tourism There are several historic buildings in the city.

Based on the Mishnah in Pesahim 119b, the afikoman is a substitute for the Passover sacrifice, which was the last thing eaten at the Passover Seder during the eras of the First and Second Temples and during the period of the Tabernacle. The Talmud states that it is forbidden to have any other food after the afikoman, so that the taste of the matzo that was eaten after the meal remains in the participants' mouths. Since the destruction of the Temple and the discontinuation of the Korban Pesach, Jews eat a piece of matzo now known as afikomen to finish the Passover Seder meal. Customs around the afikoman vary, though they often share the common purpose of keeping children awake and alert during the Seder until the afikoman is eaten. Following Ashkenazi customs, the head of household may hide the afikoman for the children to find, or alternatively, the children may steal the afikoman and ransom it back. Chabad tradition discourages stealing the afikoman lest it lead to bad habits. Following Mizrahi customs, the afikoman may be tied in a sling to a child's back for the duration of the Seder. Etymology The Greek word on which afikoman is based has two meanings, according to the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud. Both Talmuds agree on the halakha (stated in the Passover Haggadah under the answer given to the Wise Son) that no other food should be eaten for the rest of the night after the afikoman is consumed. The Babylonian Talmud explains that the word \\"afikoman\\" derives from the Greek word for \\"dessert\\", the last thing eaten at a meal. The Jerusalem Talmud, however, derives the word afikoman from epikomion, meaning \\"after-dinner revelry\\" or \\"entertainment\\". It was the custom of Romans and Greeks to move from one party or banquet to another. The halakha prohibiting anything else being eaten after the afikoman therefore enjoins Jews to distinguish their Passover Seder from the pagan rituals of other nations. Use The afikoman is prepared during the fourth part of the Seder, Yachatz. During this ritual, the leader of the Seder takes the middle piece of matzo out from the stack of three whole matzot on the Seder table. He breaks the matzo in two, returning the smaller piece to the stack and putting aside the larger piece to be eaten later during Tzafun (\\"Hidden\\", the twelfth part of the Seder, which immediately follows the main meal). This is the afikoman, which is wrapped in a napkin before being hidden. Custom of \\"stealing\\" The custom of hiding the afikoman so that the children at the Seder will \\"steal\\" it and demand a reward for it is based on the following Gemara: Rabbi Eliezer says that one should \\"grab the matzos\\" so that the children won't fall asleep.Pesahim 109a. The Haggadah Otzar Divrei HaMeforshim cites several other reasons for the custom of stealing the afikoman. According to Mekor Chaim ‚Äì Chavos Yair, this custom demonstrates love for the mitzvah of afikoman. Rabbi Menashe Klein, the Ungvar Rebbe, says that this custom is a re-enactment of the biblical account of Jacob stealing the blessings that were supposed to go to his brother Esau. Midrash Pliah says that Isaac told Esau, \\"Your brother came with trickery\\" (Genesis 27:35), adding, \\"and he took out the afikoman.\\" According to the Midrash, this account took place on Passover. Therefore, the children steal the afikoman to get the blessings, which are the present that they ask their fathers to buy for them. Eating the afikoman After the meal and customary desserts, the leader of the Seder distributes pieces of the afikoman to each guest. If there is not enough to go around, additional pieces of matzo may be added to each person's portion of afikoman. Jewish law prescribes that an olive-sized piece of matzo be eaten to fulfill the mitzvah of eating the afikoman. Many people eat an additional, olive-sized piece of matzo together with it. The first piece of matzo commemorates the Korban Pesach (Paschal lamb), whose meat was eaten at the very end of the festive Seder meal in the days that the Temple stood. The second piece commemorates the matzo that was eaten together with the meat of the Paschal Lamb in the days of the Temple, in fulfillment of the Torah commandment, \\"They shall eat [the Passover lamb] together with matzo and maror\\" (Exodus 12:8). Like the eating of the matzo earlier in the Seder, the afikoman is eaten while reclining to the left (in some Orthodox Jewish circles, women and girls do not lean). According to Jewish law, the afikoman must be consumed before midnight, just as the Korban Pesach was eaten before midnight during the days of the Temple in Jerusalem.Mishnah Zevachim 5:8. Thus, if the Seder is running late with much singing and discussion of the themes of the Exodus from Egypt, families may have to shorten the meal segment of the Seder and proceed quickly to the afikoman. After the eating of the afikoman, no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night, other than the last two cups of wine at the Seder and coffee, tea, or water.

It is part of the normal microbiota of the human colon and is generally commensal,http://prod.hopkins- abxguide.org/pathogens/bacteria/anaerobic_gram- neg._bacilli/bacteroides_fragilis.html?contentInstanceId=255919 but can cause infection if displaced into the bloodstream or surrounding tissue following surgery, disease, or trauma. Epidemiology and pathogenesis The B. fragilis group is the most commonly isolated Bacteroidaceae in anaerobic infections, especially those that originate from the gastrointestinal microbiota. B. fragilis is the most prevalent organism in the B. fragilis group, accounting for 41% to 78% of the isolates of the group. These organisms are resistant to penicillin by virtue of production of beta-lactamase, and by other unknown factors. This group was formerly classified as subspecies of B. fragilis (i.e. B. f. ssp. fragilis, B. f. ssp. distasonis, B. f. ssp. ovatus, B. f. ssp. thetaiotaomicron, and B. f. ssp. vulgatus). They have been reclassified into distinct species on the basis of DNA homology studies. B. fragilis (formerly known as B. f. ssp. fragilis) is often recovered from blood, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, wounds, and brain abscesses. Although the B. fragilis group is the most common species found in clinical specimens, it is the least common Bacteroides present in fecal microbiota, comprising only 0.5% of the bacteria present in stool. Their pathogenicity partly results from their ability to produce capsular polysaccharide, which is protective against phagocytosis and stimulates abscess formation. B. fragilis is involved in 90% of anaerobic peritoneal infections. It also causes bacteremia associated with intra- abdominal infections, peritonitis and abscesses following rupture of viscus, and subcutaneous abscesses or burns near the anus. Though it is gram negative, it has an altered LPS and does not cause endotoxic shock. Treatment In general, B. fragilis is susceptible to metronidazole, carbapenems, tigecycline, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g., Unasyn, Zosyn), and certain antimicrobials of the cephalosporin class, including cefoxitin. The bacteria have inherent high-level resistance to penicillin. Production of beta lactamase appears to be the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance in B. fragilis. Clindamycin is no longer recommended as the first- line agent for B. fragilis due to emerging high-level resistance (>30% in some reports). Environmental research B. fragilis bacteriophages are commonly used as tracers of human faecal material.

He is best known for having designed pictograms for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich that proved influential on the use of stick figures for public signage, as well as designing the typeface Rotis. Aicher also co- founded the Ulm School of Design. Early life and career Aicher was born in Ulm, in the south-western state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, on 13 May 1922. Aicher was a classmate and friend of Werner Scholl, and through him met Werner's family, including his siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl, both of whom would be executed in 1943 for their membership in the White Rose resistance movement in Nazi Germany. Like the Scholls, Aicher was strongly opposed to the Nazi movement. He was arrested in 1937 for refusing to join the Hitler Youth, and consequently he was failed on his abitur (college entrance) examination in 1941. He was subsequently drafted into the German army to fight in World War II, though he tried to leave at various times. In 1945 he deserted the army, and went into hiding at the Scholls' house in Wutach. In 1946, after the end of the war, Aicher began studying sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich. In 1947, he opened his own studio in Ulm. In 1952 he married Inge Scholl, the older sister of Werner, Hans, and Sophie. Ulm School of Design In 1953, along with Inge Scholl and Max Bill, he founded the Ulm School of Design (Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Ulm), which became one of Germany's leading educational centres for design from its founding until its closure in 1968. Faculty and students included such notable designers as Tom√°s Maldonado, Peter Seitz, and Anthony Froshaug. Aicher was heavily involved in corporate branding and considered one of the pioneers of Corporate design. Among others he was influential to the corporate identity of the company Braun and he designed the logo for German airline Lufthansa in 1969. 1972 Munich Olympics In 1966 Aicher was asked by the organisers of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich to become the Olympic Games' lead designer. He was asked to create a design for the Olympics that complemented the architecture of the newly built stadium in Munich designed by G√ºnther Behnisch. Aicher consulted with Masaru Katsumie, who had designed the previous 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. Basing his work in part on iconography for the '64 Games, Aicher created a set of pictograms meant to provide a visual interpretation of the sport they featured so that athletes and visitors to the Olympic village and stadium could find their way around. He created pictograms using a series of grid systems and a specific bright colour palette that he chose for these Games. These designs were directly influential on the DOT pictograms, developed in 1974 by the United States Department of Transportation, which applied the same principles to standard public signage such as those for toilets and telephones; the DOT pictograms have in turn been used around the world. The series of pictograms he created was not a simple task; the goal of each pictogram was to function as a clear sign of the activity it represented while simultaneously maintaining its universal comprehension. Otl Aicher also helped to design the logo of the Munich Olympics. He went through several stages with his design team before finally finding the successful emblem. One of their first ideas was to use an element of the city's coat of arms or M√ºnchner Kindl within the design which showed a monk or child pointing into the distance while clasping a book in his hand. Other ideas were to use the surrounding areas of the city, referencing the sun, mountains and landscape within the design. Finally the \\"Strahlenkranz\\" was created, a garland which represented the sun but also the five Olympic rings merged in a spiral shape. Designer Coordt von Mannstein reworked Aicher's original design through a mathematical calculation to amalgamate the garland and spiral together to get the final design. The colours chosen for the designs of the games were selected to reflect the tones of the Alps. The mountains in blue and white would make up the palette of colours which also included green, orange and silver. The colours were used to identify allocated themes such as media, technical services, celebrity hospitality and public functions and each had a different colour so visitors could differentiate the themes around the stadium and village. Uniforms were colour-coordinated to represent these themes, the Olympic staff could be identified as working for a particular department by the colour they were wearing. Aicher used the typeface Univers for the Olympic designs. The design team produced 21 sports posters to advertise the sports at the games, using the official design colours and also including the logo and \\"M√ºnchen 1972\\". The design team used a technique called \\"posterization\\" for the graphics on the posters, separating the tonal qualities from the images in a manual process and using the official munich colours for these games. The first of these posters was a poster of the Olympic stadium which became the official poster for these games. The posters were displayed all around the city of Munich and around the Olympic sites. Posters were hung in twos alongside posters designed by famous artists chosen to represent this Olympics such as David Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Tom Wesselmann and Allen Jones. He also created the first official Olympic Mascot, a striped dachshund named Waldi.

The statue was unveiled on Chalon Way opposite the Glass House pub in March 2010 and was relocated to the stadium following its completion in October 2011. Coaching career Following his retirement as a player, Cunningham took up an assistant coaching role in the strength and conditioning department at St Helens. After the sacking of Royce Simmons in 2012 he was appointed assistant head coach of St Helens, working alongside temporary head coach Mike Rush. On Monday 20 October 2014, Cunningham was appointed as head coach of St. Helens. He appointed former Saints teammate Sean Long to assist him for his role.Sean Long returns to St Helens as Keiron Cunningham‚Äôs assistant coachSport. The Guardian (17 November 2014).

Clark (2014) \\"Hanging Rock Recreation Reserve\\", In: An Historical Geography of Tourism in Victoria, Australia: Case Studies, Ian D. Clarke ed., De Gruyter Open Ltd: Warsaw/Berlin, pp. 111-134. and to some of its traditional owners as Ngannelong) is a distinctive geological formation in central Victoria, Australia. A former volcano, it lies 718m above sea level (105m above plain level) on the plain between the two small townships of Newham and Hesket, approximately 70 km north-west of Melbourne and a few kilometres north of Mount Macedon. In the middle of the 19th century, the traditional occupants of the place ‚Äì tribes of the Dja Dja Wurrung, Woi Wurrung and Taungurung ‚Äì were forced from it. They had been its occupants for, potentially, thousands of years and, colonisation notwithstanding, have continued to maintain cultural and spiritual connections with the place. To the settler colonialist society, Hanging Rock became a place for recreation and tourism. It came alternately under private, government, and mixed public- private control. In the late 20th century, the area became very widely known as the setting of Joan Lindsay's novel Picnic at Hanging Rock.  Toponyms Attempts to uncover Hanging Rock's Aboriginal name have proven difficult. Some think it is \\"Anneyelong\\" because of an inscription underneath an engraving of the rock made by German naturalist, William Blandowski, during an expedition in 1855‚Äì56. Historian and toponymist Ian D. Clark believes Blandowski misheard the name, and the word was possibly \\"Ngannelong\\" or something similar. The name \\"Diogenes Mount\\" was bestowed on the rock by the surveyor Robert Hoddle in 1843 in keeping with the spirit of several ancient Macedonian names given by Major Thomas Mitchell during his expedition through Victoria in 1836, which passed close to Hanging Rock. Others include Mount Macedon, Mount Alexander and the Campaspe River. Six other European names (Mount Diogenes, Diogenes' Head, Diogenes Monument, Dryden's Rock, Dryden's Monument and Hanging Rock) have also been recorded for the site. Geology The 'Hanging Rock' over the path up to the summit that gives the site as a whole its name. Hanging Rock is a mamelon, created 6.25 million years ago by stiff magma pouring from a vent and congealing in place. Often thought to be a volcanic plug, it is not. Two other mamelons exist nearby, created in the same period: Camels Hump, to the south on Mount Macedon and, to the east, Crozier's Rocks. Alternative names for Crozier's Rocks are Brock's Monument, Alexander's Head and Mount Crystal. All three mamelons are composed of soda trachyte. As Hanging Rock's magma cooled and contracted it split into rough columns. These weathered over time into the many pinnacles that can be seen today. The significance of these three mamelons demonstrates the mechanism of plate tectonics. As the Australian Plate moved northwards towards East Asia, over a period of 27 million years it passed over a volcanic hotspot. This resulted in a chain of volcanoes stretching from Hillsborough (33 million years ago) in Northern Queensland to Hanging Rock (6.5 million years ago) which is part of the southernmost end of this volcanic activity. This chain also includes the Warrumbungles (New South Wales, 15.5 million years ago) and the Glass House Mountains (Southern Queensland, 24.3 million years ago). These volcanoes all have the same chemical composition. Hanging Rock contains numerous distinctive rock formations, including the \\"Hanging Rock\\" itself (a boulder suspended between other boulders, under which is the main entrance path), the Colonnade, the Eagle and the UFO. The highest point on Hanging Rock is 718 metres above sea level and 105 metres above the plain below.  Traditional owners and colonisation  William Blandowski, Diogenes Monument \\"Anneyelong\\" looking Sth towards Mt Macedon, 1855/56. At the time of colonisation, the traditional occupants had lived around Hanging Rock for more than 26,000 years. The Rock was woven into the fabric of the culture of the traditional owners. However, they were forcibly displaced from the area. Jason Tamiru has expressed a Yung Balug perspective on this history: > The truth is my people were hit hard during the frontier wars. The Western > region is known to us as the Killing Fields. The naming of the Rock is with > all those that come in my dreams. Australia is starting to learn that there > is a black history in this country that needs to be acknowledged and > celebrated. Long before the 1967 novel, 1975 film and the naming of Hanging Rock, Tribes of the Dja Dja Wurrung, Woi Wurrung and Taungurung would gather at that location for important Men‚Äôs Ceremony. This is a place where big business was held: Corrobborees, Initiation Ceremonies, Songline Ceremonies, trade and relationship building and a place where laws were made and passed. According to Tamiru, Ngannelong continues to play a role in Yung Balug culture: > The mystique and spiritual essence of the rock has contributed to the story > of our Dreaming which binds my people to our creator spirits and country. We Sing, Dance and Paint our Country forever. Settler colonialists dispossessed the Aboriginal owners and forced them out of the area. \\"One of the last initiation ceremonies may have been held there in November 1851 by a Wurundjeri elder from the Templestowe area\\" in the Yarra Valley. This ceremony was also attended by two young settlers' children, Willie Chivers, 11, and his younger brother Tom, 7, who were being cared for on a daily basis by the tribe after their mother had died. Their father went missing after looking for their mother. An engraving made by William Blandowski in 1855/56 shows a group of Aboriginal people camped on the hillside. Another engraving by Robert Bruce published in an 1865 edition of The Illustrated Melbourne Post shows three Aboriginal figures in the foreground with Hanging Rock rising up in the background. Community Horse races have been held at Hanging Rock for over one hundred years; the Hanging Rock Racing Club holds two race meetings a year on New Year's Day and Australia Day (26 January). The Friends of Hanging Rock, established in 1987, is a community group which holds events open to the public, such as planting days and wildlife tours. In 2013, the Hanging Rock Action Group was formed by local residents to call for adequate community consultation about the Macedon Ranges Shire Council's proposal to build a 200-person conference centre and 100 bed hotel in the Eastern Paddock, adjacent to and very visible from the Rock. The anger by the local community over this issue led to 7 of 9 councillors being voted out in the following elections. Hanging Rock is the centrepiece for the Hanging Rock Recreation Reserve, a public reserve managed by the Macedon Ranges Shire Council. The reserve includes a horse racing track, picnic grounds, creek, interpretation centre and cafe. The reserve is a habitat for endemic flora and fauna, including koalas, wallabies, possums, phascogales, wedge-tailed eagles and kookaburras. There is also a \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\" costumed event held in February around Valentines Day, organized by Central Highlands Victorian Historical Group. Participants dress in Victorian or Edwardian attire and picnic at the base before climbing the Rock for photo opportunities. The reserve is open to the public during daylight hours seven days a week. Entry is charged per vehicle. Camping is possible by arrangement. Hanging Rock Reserve is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register as a place of historical, aesthetic and social significance to the State of Victoria. Hanging Rock Reserve is currently under review by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning to determine future governance and administrative arrangements for management of the site. Treatments in novel and film William Ford, At the Hanging Rock, 1875, National Gallery of Victoria Hanging Rock was the inspiration and setting for the novel Picnic at Hanging Rock, written by Joan Lindsay and published in 1967. The novel dealt with the disappearance of a number of schoolgirls during a visit to the site. Their disappearance was explained in the final chapter, but Lindsay deleted this chapter at the suggestion of her editor, thinking the mystery was greater without it. The novel inspired the film Picnic at Hanging Rock, made in 1975 and directed by Peter Weir. The success of the film was responsible for a substantial increase in visits to the rock and a renewal of interest in the novel. Yvonne Rousseau wrote a book called The Murders at Hanging Rock, published in 1980, which examined possible explanations for the disappearance of the girls. The deleted final chapter of the novel was finally published in 1987 after the death of Joan Lindsay. Lindsay had given the copyright for the last chapter to her literary agent John Taylor on the understanding he would only publish it after her death. It was titled The Secret of Hanging Rock. Concert venue Hanging Rock reserve is currently used as an occasional outdoor concert venue by major international acts on the Australian leg of their tours. The following events have taken place at Hanging Rock as part of a trial by Frontier Touring and the Macedon Ranges Shire Council: * Leonard Cohen ‚Äì November 2010 * Rod Stewart ‚Äì February 2012 * Bruce Springsteen ‚Äì March 2013 (Wrecking Ball tour) In 2014 the Rolling Stones were scheduled to play a night concert (30 March) at Hanging Rock as part of their \\"14 On Fire\\" tour. The death of Mick Jagger's partner, L'Wren Scott, resulted in the postponement of the entire tour. The tour was rescheduled and resumed in Adelaide on October 25, 2014. The Hanging Rock concert was rescheduled to take place on Saturday, November 8, 2014, but Rolling Stones lead Mick Jagger cancelled the concert due to a throat infection. In October 2013 Frontier Touring signed a five-year agreement with the Macedon Ranges Shire Council to hold up to four concerts per year at Hanging Rock, effective from 31 October 2014.

It connects popular tourism destinations of the James River Plantations with Colonial Williamsburg and Jamestown. The current bridge, which opened on January 24, 2009, replaced the deteriorating 70-year-old bridge. 1939 bridge The original bridge, built in 1939 by Tidewater Construction, was a swing-span movable bridge. It was a two-lane facility with a history of opening-closing failures and expensive repairs, as well as height restrictions due to clearance being 13'11\\" tall. It functioned as a swing-span bridge, pivoting on its axis to allow boats to pass through an opening rather than lifting upward like a drawbridge. The bridge was 2,025 feet long and was 24 feet wide from curb to curb. It was built using timber pilings and had a concrete and steel driving deck. Among repair problems as the bridge aged was shifting of the timber pilings. The current bridge has a height restriction for boats of only 12 feet except when opened.https://ocsdata.ncd.noaa.gov/BookletChart/12251_BookletChart.pdf VDOT closed the bridge several times for limited periods in 2004 when the swing mechanism failed to completely close the bridge, said state officials. The closure inconvenienced residents who regularly used the bridge, forcing on them a 63-mile detour to cross the river. Some frustrated residents parked vehicles at each end of the disabled bridge and either walked or rode golf carts across it. That was when the state decided to replace the aging bridge, which was traveled by an estimated 3,500 vehicles per day, said VDOT Williamsburg Resident Administrator Todd Halacy. Blasting as part of demolition of the old bridge occurred on March 7, 2009. 2009 bridge The current bridge opened on January 24, 2009, about seven months ahead of schedule, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Construction on the new span, estimated to cost $33.6 million, began in 2007. The new bridge crosses slightly west of the previous span. The fixed-span bridge rises 52 feet above the water and alleviates the necessity of stopping highway traffic to open the movable span on the former bridge, as well as being more convenient for the recreational boaters who can now pass freely upriver to a point near Walkers Dam. The new bridge also has a much wider travel surface to accommodate bikers and pedestrians. According to VDOT, it features two 12-foot travel lanes, two 10-foot shoulders and a 10-foot shared- use path (separated from the main roadway by a divider) incorporated into the Virginia Capital Trail project. The bridge is named for Judith Stewart Dresser, who died in 2003 at the age of 57. She lived on the river near the bridge and was a leader in the preservation of historic Route 5 and the establishment of a hospice house in Williamsburg.

Clayton Nicholas Joseph Clayton (November 1, 1840 in Cloyne, County Cork ‚Äì December 9, 1916) was a prominent Victorian era architect in Galveston, Texas. Clayton constructed many grand religious and public buildings in Galveston including the First Presbyterian Church (Galveston, Texas). He is also credited as the architect of Sacred Heart Catholic Church (Tampa, Florida) and of the Main Building of St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. He also designed an addition to St. Mary Cathedral in Galveston. \\"His work represents a lifetime, worked out day by day under the most ordinary and circumstantial conditions, dedicated to the cause of architecture as the public art.\\" Life Nicholas Joseph Clayton was born on November 1, 1840 (or possibly 1839), in Cloyne, County Cork, Ireland, to Nicholas Joseph and Margaret O'Mahoney Clayton. In 1848, his father died in a granary accident. The widowed Margaret Clayton emigrated with her son to Cincinnati, Ohio, where her brother made shoes buckles. Young Clayton attended parochial schools. He later followed his uncle, Daniel Crowley, into the building trades, first as an apprentice plasterer and later a stone cutter. He was a Navy yeoman during the Civil War, assigned to the gunboat the USS Juliet. After the war, he returned to Cincinnati, where he became first a marble carver and then an architectural draftsman. He studied architecture with W.H. Baldwin of the Memphis firm Jones and Baldwin which sent him, in the winter of 1872, to Galveston, Texas as supervising architect for the construction of the Norman Romanesque First Presbyterian Church and the Tremont House. Upon arriving in the city, he soon met with Bishop Claude Marie Dubuis to discuss possible improvements to St. Mary's Cathedral, built in 1846. Clayton soon designed the central tower and later a new bell and statue of Mary, Star of the Sea. He remained in Galveston and set up his own office,Handbook of Texas Online, Robert A. Nesbitt and Stephen Fox, \\"Clayton, Nicholas Joseph,\\" becoming one of the first professional architects to establish a practice in Texas. Saint Marys Cathedral, Austin, TX \\"Over the next three decades Clayton's work and influence would dominate the physical character of Galveston.\\"Speck, Larry. \\"Old Red, University of Texas Medical School Galveston\\", Landmarks of Texas Architecture, (1986), University of Texas Press His first known independent work was St. Mary's Church (now St. Mary's Cathedral) in Austin (1873‚Äì84). It may have been through the Holy Cross fathers that the bishop connected Nicholas Clayton with St. Mary's in Austin.\\"History\\", Saint Mary Cathedral In a 2013 interview regarding the ongoing restoration, Cathedral Rector Albert Lafloret observed that, when finished, \\"then you'll really see how beautiful the work is that's been done and what a glorious plan Nicholas Clayton had.\\"Castillo, Juan. \\"St. Mary Cathedral gets a face-lift\\", American-Statesman, February 2, 2013 A devout Catholic who attended daily mass, Clayton designed buildings for the Congregation of the Sacred Heart, as well as numerous parishes throughout the diocese of Galveston, Dallas, and Alexandria, Louisiana. He also produced major church and institutional buildings for Catholic religious orders, especially the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, the Ursuline Sisters, the Jesuits, and the Congregation of Holy Cross. His religious architecture accounted for the broadest geographical distribution of his work outside Galveston. These demonstrate his self-assured free eclecticism and his interpretation of contemporary French and British styles. Clayton had a particular affinity for ecclesiastical architecture and his work spanned a number of faiths, including the Eaton Chapel at Trinity Episcopal, Temple B'Nai Israel, and Grace Episcopal Church. Nicholas Clayton is described as 5 feet 10 inches with pale blue eyes and closely cropped curly brown hair, which he wore longer as it turned gray. Robust and active, he liked to walk and to swim in the Gulf. He was a member of The Knights of Columbus, and The Ancient Order of Hibernians. In 1873 he brought his mother to Galveston, where they lived in a cottage on the outside of town. A tireless worker he was noted for his bold style, attention to detailing, and professionalism. It was his custom to work six days a week, excluding Sundays and Christmas, although he rarely spent much time in his office on Postoffice Street. In 1887, he oversaw sixty- four projects. A meticulous perfectionist about his work, Clayton was quiet and reserved with a mild sense of humor. For many years, he devoted his free time to the children at St. Mary's Orphanage, and managed the annual New Year's Eve fireworks display.Wooten, Heather Green. Old Red: Pioneering Medical Education in Texas, Texas A&M; University Press, 2013, In 1877 he went into business with fellow-Irishman, civil engineer Michael L. Lynch. The firm of Clayton and Lynch lasted until 1881. Lynch subsequently re-located to Fort Worth. Clayton's uncle, Daniel Crowley, joined him from Cincinnati and handled the modelling and embellishment of the Eaton Memorial Chapel of Trinity Protestant Episcopal Church. The Galveston Electric Pavilion was the first building in Texas with electric lighting. Before designing the University of Texas Medical Building, he first took a tour of Johns Hopkins, the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Harvard. On July 6, 1891, Clayton married a much younger Mary Lorena Ducie, in a marriage possibly arranged by her father, Daniel W. Ducie, a Confederate veteran and friend of Clayton's and the painting contractor with whom he worked most closely. The couple honeymooned in Monterey, Mexico, where according to family lore, Clayton spent so much time sketching churches that his bride hinted that she might return to Galveston. They purchased a house on 35th Street, where they raised five children. His son, Nicholas Jr. became an electrician. The worst name Clayton ever called anyone was \\"muttonhead,\\" according to family reminiscences. He told his boys their mouths were for praying and eating. He was a charter member of the Association of Texas Architects, and a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. After 25 years as the premier architect of the city, just after the turn of the century, Clayton, for a variety of reasons, suffered a swift and painful professional decline. Commissions suffered while the community focused on recovering after the hurricane. Then too, Clayton was more of an artist, than conscientious businessman, and perhaps relied to much on others for that part of the business. A bid to build Galveston's new county courthouse was accepted while Clayton was out of state on a project. The firm forfeited on a bond and become involved in a lengthy lawsuit, which he ultimately lost, and Clayton was forced to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. Clayton later served on an advisory board for the construction of the dome of the Capitol in Austin. His last known commission was adding the dome to Galveston's Sacred Heart Church in 1910. Nicholas Clayton was repairing his own chimney by the light of a candle in November 1916 when his wool undershirt caught on fire and he was severely burned. Despite otherwise excellent health, he succumbed to pneumonia on Dec. 9, 1916 at the age of seventy-six, having lived in Galveston 45 years. He was buried in Galveston's Calvary Catholic Cemetery. His burial site was marked with one of his marble samples because his family could not afford a gravestone. When Mrs. Clayton grieved to their friend Rabbi Henry Cohen, of having no money for a proper monument, Rabbi Cohen is said to have replied, \\"Oh, you don't need one, my dear Mary Lorena. He's got them all over town. Just go around and read some cornerstones.\\" In 2015, in recognition of Clayton's 175th birthday, the city of Galveston declared Sunday November 1 as \\"Nicholas Clayton Day\\". Style Clayton was a High Victorian architect with a \\"spirited, picturesque, eclectic\\" approach.\\"Nicholas Joseph Clayton\\", Alexander Architectural Archive, University of Texas, Austin His buildings were exuberant in shape, color, texture, and detail. The University of Texas Medical Building mixes Romanesque arcades with Spanish Baroque parapets, Italian Gothic gables, and vaguely Moorish pinnacles. Clayton excelled at decorative brick and iron work, and took full advantage of the skills of the masons and bricklayers who had immigrated to Galveston from Western Europe. His High Victorian predilections were evident not only in his buildings of the 1870s, but in those influenced by the Queen Anne movement of the 1880s, the Richardsonian Romanesque movement of the late 1880s and 1890s, and the revival of Renaissance classicism after 1890. An academic distribution of space in institutional structures, and unencumbered loft space in commercial buildings were typical of his work. What made Clayton's architecture so distinctive in late nineteenth-century Texas was the underlying compositional and proportional order with which he structured the display of picturesque shapes and rich ornament. His papers and drawings are held at the Alexander Architectural Archive at the University of Texas in Austin, and in the Galveston and Texas History Center of the Rosenberg Library, Galveston. Notable buildings The Beach Hotel, Galveston About fifty of Clayton's buildings remain in Galveston today. Many were destroyed in the great fire of November 1885 that wiped out forty-five blocks of the city. The Galveston Pavilion built about 1881, burned down in 1883. Harmony Hall, also built about 1881, burned in 1928. The flamboyant Beach Hotel, built in 1882, burned to the ground in 1888, while Clayton watched from his bed. Sacred Heart Church was so severely damaged by the hurricane of 1900 that it had to be demolished. The Ursuline Academy in Galveston, built about 1894, was one of Clayton's largest and most important architectural design. It was demolished in 1962 after sustaining damage from the 1961 Hurricane Carla. The Galveston Historical Foundation worked with owners and the city to have those remaining designated historical landmarks.\\"GHF and the City of Galveston Celebrate Nicholas Clayton‚Äôs 175th Birthday on November 1\\", Galveston Historical Foundation Bishop's Palace, postcard The Bishop's Palace, Galveston was originally built in 1887 for railroad entrepreneur Col. Walter Gresham. Clayton was heavily involved in the design of the interior spaces of the mansion. The front parlor fireplace was purchased in 1876 at the Philadelphia World's Fair, where it had won a first prize. The house was one of the first in the region to be fully equipped for gas and electric fixtures. Sold in 1923 to the Diocese of Galveston, it was one of the few structures that sustained little damage from the 1900 hurricane.Speck, Larry. \\"The Bishop's Palace\\", Landmarks of Texas Architecture, (1986), University of Texas Press During the storm, Josephine Gresham and her staff formed a human chain out into the swirling water to reach those struggling.

A Great Britain and Wales international representative or , he played in the Super League for St. Helens and the Warrington Wolves (with whom he won three Challenge Cup finals). St Helens Briers started his career with hometown club St. Helens, and he made his d√©but in 1997 at the age of 18, standing in for suspended captain Bobbie Goulding. He made six appearances for the club, scoring one try and 24 goals, with his performances helping Saints to reach the 1997 Challenge Cup Final. Briers was dropped following the return of Goulding to the starting lineup, and learned that he might not even be included in the squad for the upcoming Challenge Cup final. Seeking regular first-team football, he joined Warrington Wolves in April 1997 for a fee of ¬£65,000. Warrington Briers made an instant impact at his new club. His presence as a added an attacking edge to the Warrington team and he was nominated for Young Player of the Year in his first season at Wilderspool Stadium. Having made his Wales d√©but in 1998, Briers went on to make 23 appearances for his country and featured in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Briers was capped by Great Britain against France in their 42-12 win on 26 October 2001. Briers went on to become the primary playmaker of the Warrington team, and was named as captain in 2003. During that time Briers became well known for his excellent kicking skills and his ability to successfully convert drop goals. He currently holds the Super League record, and jointly Warrington all-time record (with Paul Bishop), for the most drop goals in a game (5 against Halifax at the Shay in 2002).

Following the Wales team's failure to qualify for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, Briers announced his international retirement. Briers played in the 2010 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. Briers came out of international retirement to represent Wales in the 2010 European Cup, and captained the side to victory in the tournament.

During this season he broke a number of club records including top all-time points scorer, having overtaken club greats Brian Bevan, and Steve Hesford. He broke the record during a Challenge Cup home 112‚Äì0 demolition of Swinton.

On 27 January 2016, Paraguayan Newspaper La Naci√≥n had reported that Carlos Echeverr√≠a Estigarribia, the elected intendent of the city of Luque, states his intention of wanting Luque to be one of the most important cities. Toponymy The name Luque is first mentioned in 1635 in an act of the Cabildo of Asunci√≥n when the colonial governor of the Governorate of Paraguay, Mart√≠n Ledesma de Valderrama, granted two leagues of land to a Spanish Captain named Miguel Ant√≥n de Luque in a place near Asunci√≥n known as las Salinas. According to the act this was the place where Captain Ant√≥n de Luque had been working an Encomienda for more than twenty years. A century later, in 1743, another Miguel de Luque, a descendant of the first mentioned, made a donation by testament of a section of those lands to the Franciscans who built a chapel for the devotion of the Virgin of the Rosary in 1750 - 1755, and from that time the old name of Salinas was changed to Valle de Luque. In 1781 governor Pedro Melo de Portugal made the first administrative division of the Governorate of Paraguay into six towns and designated the district with the name Partido de Luque.

The band's first album is also self-titled, causing confusion among consumers and retailers upon its release. It is the final album featuring bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius and drummer Peter Erskine in the rhythm section, bringing to an end what many fans considered the best lineup in the band's history. The album features an increasingly heavy use of synthesized orchestration from Josef Zawinul, who had been becoming even more dominant within the band's sound. Zawinul was by now frequently doubling the basslines on Quadra synthesizer, something which annoyed and alienated Pastorius, who also had reservations about Zawinul's electronic big band sound (and who was himself increasingly working on a side career with a mostly acoustic band). The vast majority of the album was composed by Zawinul, with the exception of one Wayne Shorter piece and one collectively composed item assembled from a group jam. The center piece of the album is the three part \\"N.Y.C.\\" The three movement suite starts with 41st Parallel, a bouncing groove showing off Erskine's unique touch on the drums.

It has a very characteristic odor which is compared by many people to rotten cabbage. It is a common building block in organic synthesis and an excellent ligand for metal ions. Preparation 1,2-Ethanedithiol is prepared commercially by the reaction of 1,2-dichloroethane with aqueous sodium bisulfide. In the laboratory, it can also be prepared by the action of 1,2-dibromoethane on thiourea followed by hydrolysis. Applications As a 1,2-dithiol, this compound is widely used in organic chemistry because it reacts with aldehydes and ketones to give 1,3-dithiolanes, which are useful intermediates. R. E.

He is active in political debate and was a major critic of the G√∂ran Persson cabinet. He is also second cousin of the recording artist Cat Stevens. Scherman revealed in an interview in the radio program Ekots l√∂rdagsintervju, in early January 2004, that he had been threatened by Persson after the end of broadcasting a debate between the party leaders on 10 September, before the 2002 election. According to Scherman, who retold the story both in an article in the newspaper Expressen a week later, and later before a Riksdag Committee, the Swedish prime minister had complained that the debate moderators, Lennart Ekdal and Alice Bah had done a bad job, and accused Scherman and his staff of \\"investing heavily\\" in a non-Socialist victory in the election, pointing out how this policy would lead to him making enemies in Rosenbad, the government offices in Stockholm, if the Social Democrats would retain power in the election. Scherman also claimed that it became more difficult for TV4 to get access to Persson after 10 September and pointed out Bj√∂rn Rosengren, another prominent Social Democratic politician, had called him to complain that TV4 was biased against the Social Democrats. According to Scherman, Olof Palme and Carl Bildt had also had their own favorites among reporters, denying access to others. Scherman called it \\"a Swedish version of the Italian Berlusconi model\\".Jan Scherman retold the story in \\"Jan Scherman om G√∂ran Perssons hotelser\\"; Expressen, 7 January 2004; Konstitutionsutskottets bet√§nkande, 2003/04:KU20: Granskningsbet√§nkande (Report of the investigation by the Riksdag Committee on the Constitution); see also Bo Madestrand, \\"Persson hotade TV4 h√§vdar Scherman\\", Dagens Nyheter 15 April 2004.

In the interrogation with the Committee on the Constitution, Persson agreed that he had found the debate badly organised and the questioning of himself very aggressive. He admitted to having told Scherman what he thought about the debate at the buffet afterwards; he stated that he could not remember exactly how he expressed himself but denied having threatened Scherman and claimed that, had he done so, Scherman would obviously have made news out of it. He also denied having shown any partiality against TV4. As there were no witnesses to the conversation, the Committee concluded that it would not be possible to state with certainty what had been said. Scherman is also known for having criticized the Stenbeck-owned Modern Times Group media corporation, the main owner of the competing channel TV3, which owned a part of TV4 AB and was represented on the board for sabotaging board meetings and working against the interest of TV4.

The Constitutional Army (; also known as the Constitutionalist Army) was the army that fought against the Federal Army, and later, against the Villistas and Zapatistas during the Mexican Revolution. It was formed in March 1913 by Venustiano Carranza, so-called \\"First-Chief\\" of the army, as a response to the murder of President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez by Victoriano Huerta during La Decena Tr√°gica (Ten Tragic Days) of 1913, and the resulting usurpation of presidential power by Huerta. Carranza had a few military forces on which he could rely for loyalty. He had the theoretical support of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, but they soon turned against the Constitutionalists after Huerta's defeat in 1914. In July 1913, Carranza divided the country into seven areas for military operations. Each area was, at least in theory, the responsibility of a general commanding an Army corps. These corps were: Northeast, Northwest, Central, East, West, South and Southeast. However the last four existed only on paper and in reality the Constitutionalist army was made up of only the Northwest Corps (renamed the Army of Operations) under √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, the Northeast Corps under Pablo Gonz√°lez, and the Central Corps under P√°nfilo Natera. Entrance of the constitutional cavalry to the Paseo de la Reforma. When fighting broke out in 1914 between the Constitutionalists (Carranza, Obreg√≥n, etc.) and the Conventionalists (Villa and Zapata) following the Convention of Aguascalientes, the Constitutional Army numbered 57,000 men, to Villa and Zapata's 72,000 men. But as the Constitutionalists grew stronger, Villa and Zapata grew weaker. Eventually the war against the Conventionalists was won after the assassination of Zapata in 1919 and the surrender of Villa in July 1920. By 1917, the main fighting of the civil war between the two factions was over, with some minor revolts by Felicistas (supporters of F√©lix D√≠az, nephew of ousted president Porfirio D√≠az). This marked the end of any real resistance to Carranza. However, when Carranza's autocratic rule was threatened, the threat would come from the Constitutionalist army he had set up. Carranza was assassinated after he tried to have Obreg√≥n arrested on false charges (Obreg√≥n was put up for election for president, which threatened Carranza and his choice of successor, Ignacio Bonillas) and Obreg√≥n, under the Plan of Agua Prieta, marched on Mexico City with his army. Carranza fled the capital and was killed in the Sierra Norte of Puebla on 21 May 1920. In 1920, Obreg√≥n was elected president, and some other former Constitutionalist generals would eventually become presidents and leading politicians in the years ahead.

It can be reached only by boat.Keewaydin Island It is managed by the State of Florida's Coastal Office, in cooperation with NOAA, within the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. Keewaydin Island is monitored nightly for Loggerhead turtle nesting activity by The Conservancy of Southwest Florida. The Keewaydin Island shoreline has been mapped annually since 1997 in an effort to document shoreline change. The shoreline is also mapped after significant storm events. Mapping is done by collecting Global Positioning System locations along the dune-line and then downloaded using Geographic information system software. Keewaydin Island  History  Originally, the island was named Kee Island. It became part of the Keewaydin Camps Ltd. corporation and was later known as Keewaydin Island. The island is currently about 85% public property and 15% private. Approximately 50 private lots and 15 private homes dot the island, located on the west side of the island close to the beachfront. Marco Island can be seen from the southern tip of Keewaydin. Keewaydin Island is a barrier island in Florida that has no cars, roads, or bridges. It had a history of being the next developable barrier island, after Marco Island to the south was developed in the 1950s, 1960s, and onward. During the late 1950s and early 60s when the government was planning a road and bridge out to the island, 1,000 local residents signed a petition to stop the road and any future commercial development. They wanted to avoid the pattern on barrier islands at the time, such as Fort Myers Beach, where local residents were 85% against dense development, but zoning laws and large property owners held sway. In fact, high density high rise structures line the shores on most barrier islands in Florida, except notable places like Keewaydin, where the environmentalist movement finally got enough momentum to stop the bridge to the island. As a result, Keewaydin remains primitive, with the only infrastructure being dirt pathways connecting the private docks on the eastern side to the houses on the western beach side. Locals and visitors can relish the experience of a visit to a pristine barrier island and its ecosystem. Most commonly known for the south tip of the island, where local boaters congregate at the end of the 8 mile long isthmus, where they can park their boat on the shore and enjoy people watching and the beach and scenery.  Wildlife  The island includes one of the largest and most important reserves called Rookery Bay. Mammals such as Wild Boar, Bobcat, and White-tailed deer live on the island. The Gopher Tortoise which is threatened by habitat destruction finds sanctuary on this island, aside from the invasive Iguana which feeds on the tortoise's eggs.

Description It is located in the north of Cardiff and can be considered a two-part ward, each containing about half the population; a northern section of mainly middle class housing, and a southern section commonly known as the Gabalfa housing estate which consists of public sector and former public sector housing stock. When the Community Charge (or Poll Tax) was introduced in 1990 the Gabalfa housing estate and also parts of the Mynachdy housing estate were placed into the new Llandaff North Electoral Ward, and the boundaries of the Gabalfa Electoral Ward were moved and redrawn to create a now separate ward to the south east of the new Llandaff North ward. This new Gabalfa ward still includes the Gabalfa Interchange and also some parts of Mynachdy, but no longer includes any of the Gabalfa housing estate. It is understood that these changes, which still remain controversial to this day, were brought about so that residents of Gabalfa and Mynachdy could then be charged the much higher rate of Poll Tax which was then being levied on anyone who was \\"a resident of Llandaff North\\".

The Insurance Society of New York initially provided study space and material to young people entering the insurance industry, and served as a site for insurance lectures. Over the years, ISNY developed a curriculum based upon these lectures. The curriculum ultimately led to the creation of The School of Insurance, followed by The College of Insurance. The College of Insurance offered bachelor's and master's degrees in insurance and actuarial science. It provided professional exam preparatory seminars for insurance and actuarial science designations and held classes after business hours for working professionals in New York City. At its largest, total enrollment was approximately 400. Among the benefits of the college was its co-operative program. Although most students were employed by local insurers prior to enrolling at TCI, others were placed with an insurer who paid the student and often subsidized the student's tuition. vertical campus St. John's University In 2001, St. John's University in Jamaica, New York took over the college's programs, creating The School of Risk Management, Insurance and Actuarial Science (SRM). The Manhattan location of the college now houses many graduate business and professional programs of St. John's Peter J. Tobin College of Business. Location Until May 2014, the college was located within the Financial District of lower Manhattan, at 101 Murray Street. This location was situated only a few blocks from Wall Street, TriBeCa and Battery Park City. The college consisted of a ten-story, prize- winning \\"vertical campus,\\" which featured an airy five-story entrance atrium, 16 conference and seminar rooms, 24 high-tech classrooms, a variety of computer labs, a cafeteria, dormitories and the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Library. Following the sale of the 101 Murray Street campus, the School of Risk Management including the Davis Library moved to St. John's new Manhattan location at 101 Astor Place, part of the Maki-designed office tower at 51 Astor. The previous building at Murray Street was demolished in May 2015.http://ny.curbed.com/tags/101-murray-street Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Library The Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Library at the college comprises the world's largest collection of risk and insurance literature, policies, and related documents. Throughout its history, the library has served students, faculty, staff, and industry practitioners seeking specialized knowledge in risk management, insurance, and actuarial science. The library maintains the original archive of the Insurance Society of New York, as well as many historical insurance documents. Under The Insurance Society of New York, a number of individuals and organizations contributed to the library's growing collection throughout the 1900s. In 1974, Shelby Cullom David and his wife Kathryn presented The College of Insurance with a major endowment. This endowment helped to secure the library's future and it was renamed in their honor. With the merger of The College of Insurance and St. John's University, the Davis Library became part of the St. John's University library system. Center for Professional Education The Center for Professional Education is located within the School of Risk Management, Insurance and Actuarial Science. For over 30 years, the Center has served the educational needs of more than 10,000 professionals in the insurance, risk management and financial services industry. The Center provides seminars, workshops, certificate programs and professional designation examination preparation courses for students of St. John's School of Risk Management within the Tobin College of Business, and working professionals in the New York City area.

He was a hard-hitting middle-order batsman and a right-arm bowler who, at his peak, was genuinely fast; in addition, he developed a pioneering slower ball and was the first bowler to use it regularly in one-day cricket. A true all-rounder, Stephenson came to prominence first playing for the West Indies Young Cricketers team that toured England in 1978. Then, in less than eight months from the end of October 1981, he made his first-class debut, first in Australia, playing for Tasmania, then for his native Barbados, and finally for Gloucestershire in England. But the debut that was to a large extent to define Stephenson's career was his one the following winter, 1982‚Äì83, on a fourth continent. He joined the rebel West Indies XI, led by Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran, that toured South Africa, and played in so-called \\"Test\\" matches and \\"One Day Internationals\\" against the South African national cricket team that had been barred from world cricket because of apartheid. The rebel West Indian cricketers were themselves then barred from all levels of West Indies cricket for life, until the ban was lifted in 1989, and Stephenson never played true Test cricket. He is widely regarded as the greatest cricketer never to have played for the West Indies.Cricinfo ‚Äì Sleight of hand In fact, unlike most of the West Indian rebels, Stephenson did return to cricket in the West Indies, playing for Barbados in the 1989‚Äì90 Red Stripe Cup series. But most of his career was spent playing for English county teams and for Free State in South Africa. Stephenson's first season for Nottinghamshire in 1988 was sensational. Since the reduction in English first-class games in 1969, only one player, the New Zealander Richard Hadlee, had achieved the all-rounder's \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Stephenson in 1988 became the second and, so far, the last to achieve this feat, making 1018 runs and taking 125 wickets. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1989 for this achievement, and was also the Cricket Society's leading all-rounder. Stephenson's feat was all the more remarkable in that he brought up the run-scoring part of the double by scoring centuries in each innings of Nott's final match of the season against Yorkshire ‚Äì and also took 11 wickets in the game. Despite this truly outstanding all round performance, Notts lost the match by 127 runs.http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1980S/1988/ENG_LOCAL/CC/NOTTS_YORKS_CC_14-17SEP1988.html Without quite achieving those heights again, Stephenson was an effective all- rounder for three further seasons for Nottinghamshire, before he transferred in 1992 to Sussex, where he had four further productive seasons. In 1994, he again took the leading all-rounder award with more than 750 runs and 67 wickets. Stephenson retired from English county cricket after 1995, and from South African domestic cricket after the 1996‚Äì97 season. In addition to his cricketing career, Stephenson, a keen golfer, is also credited with a birdie on the Extreme 19th in South Africa.

It is the largest trade union in the world with 302 million members in 1,713,000 primary trade union organizations. The ACFTU is divided into 31 regional federations and 10 national industrial unions. The ACFTU is the country's sole legally-mandated trade union, with which all enterprise-level trade unions must be affiliated. There has been dispute over whether ACFTU is an independent trade union or even a trade union at all. It directs a public college, the China University of Labor Relations. History The Federation was officially founded on May 1st, 1925, when the \\"Second National Labor Congress\\" of China convened in Canton with 277 delegates representing 540,000 workers, and adopted the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Between 1922 and 1927, the organization flourished, as did the Communist Party of China‚Äôs control over the trade union movement. The labor movement had grown enormously, particularly in the three industrial and commercial centers of Canton, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, but it also had some organizational success in other cities such as Wuhan.Lee, Lao To (1986): Trade Unions in China 1949 to the Present. Singapore University Press The ACFTU was restricted in 1927 by the newly established rule of the Nationalist regime under Chiang Kai-shek who had ordered the execution of thousands of CPC cadres and their sympathizers as part of a crackdown on Communism. All Communist Party-led unions were banned and replaced with yellow unions loyal to him (e.g. the \\"Chinese Federation of Labor,\\" which has since reformed into an independent union).Traub-Merz, Rudolf (2011): All China Federation of Trade Unions: Structure, Functions and the Challenge of Collective Bargaining. International Labor Office By the rise of Mao Zedong in 1949, the ACFTU was established as China's sole national labor union center, but was again dissolved in 1966 in the wake of the Cultural Revolution in favor of revolutionary committees. Following Mao's death in 1976, in October 1978 the ACFTU held its first congress since 1957. Since the early 1990s it has been regulated by the Trade Union Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. According to a 2011 study during the period of rapid economic growth in China the ACFTU has prioritized the interests of business over the interests of labor and has lost legitimacy in the eyes of many laborers. In 2018, the 17th National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. At the congress Union leadership faced pressure to stop acting as a bridge or mediator between workers and management and start acting as a genuine voice of the workers. This pressure arose both internally and was also applied by the Communist Party of China.  Lack of independence  The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (now the International Trade Union Confederation) maintains the position that the ACFTU is not an independent union, stating in its policy: > There are differing approaches among ICFTU affiliates and Global Union > Federations concerning contacts with the ACFTU ranging from ‚Äúno contacts‚Äù to > ‚Äúconstructive dialog.‚Äù The ICFTU, noting that the ACFTU is not an > independent trade union organization and, therefore, cannot be regarded as > an authentic voice of Chinese workers, reaffirms its request to all > affiliates and Global Union Federations having contacts with the Chinese > authorities, including the ACFTU, to engage in critical dialog. This > includes raising violations of fundamental workers‚Äô and trade union rights > in any such meetings, especially concerning cases of detention of trade > union and labor rights activists. According to Charter of China Trade Union, which is passed by the 17th National Congress of China Trade Unions on October 26, 2018, ‚ÄúThe China Trade Union is a mass organization of the working class led by the Communist Party of China and a voluntary union of employees. It is a bridge and link between the Communist Party of China and the masses of workers, an important social pillar of the state power, and a representative of the interests of its members and workers.‚Äù ‚Äú The China trade unions persist in consciously accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China, shoulder the political responsibility of uniting and guiding the workers and the masses to listen to and follow the Communist Party of China, and consolidate and expand the class basis and mass basis of the Communist Party of China‚Äôs governance.‚Äù However, activists within the ACFTU and the World Federation of Trade Unions dispute the claims of the rival trade union federation. ACFTU activist Guo Wencai has said that democratic elections were a key standard to measure the effectiveness of a trade union and noted that the practice of Chinese company chiefs \\"appointing union leaders or assigning someone from their human resources department to act as union leader hampers a trade union's independence and its ability to protect workers' rights.\\"  Other labor activism in China  The ACFTU remains the country's only legally-permissible trade union. Attempts to form trade unions independent of the ACFTU have been rare and short-lived. One notable example is the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation formed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Martial Law Command Headquarters issued a public notice declaring the BWAF an illegal organization and ordering it to disband on the grounds that Federation leaders were among \\"the main instigators and organizers in the capital of the counterrevolutionary rebellion. The failure of the ACFTU to advocate for workers has led to an increase in wildcat strikes and other unauthorized labor action. Wildcat strikes are one of few options available to workers because the ACFTU refuses to authorize strikes no matter what the conditions.

The Nazis classified Hoffmann and his mother as Jewish, forcing them to flee Paris in 1940. They fled to the village of Lamalou-les-Bains in the south of France, where they spent the war hiding from the Gestapo. A French citizen since 1947, Hoffmann spent his childhood between Paris and Nice before studying at Sciences Po. In 1948, Hoffmann graduated from the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques (Sciences Po). In 1955, Hoffmann became an instructor in the Department of Government at Harvard. After several years, he received tenure and was later appointed C. Douglas Dillon Professor of the Civilization of France. He founded Harvard's Center for European Studies in 1968 (later the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies). His main fields of specialization were French politics and society, European politics, U.S. foreign policy, and international relations. In 1997, Hoffmann was named the Paul and Catherine Buttenwieser University Professor. In addition to his teaching and prolific writing, Hoffmann also participated as an expert in the film The World According to Bush, dealing with the vicissitudes of the Bush administration after the 2000 presidential election.

Sententia, the nominative singular, also called a \\"sentence\\", is a kind of rhetorical proof. Through the invocation of a proverb, quotation, or witty turn of phrase during a presentation or conversation one may be able to gain the assent of the listener, who will hear a kind of non-logical, but agreed- upon \\"truth\\" in what you are saying. An example of this is the phrase \\"age is better with wine\\" playing off of the adage \\"wine is better with age\\". History The use of sententiae has been explained by AristotleRhetoric 2.21 [1394a19ff] (when he discusses the Œ≥ŒΩœéŒºŒ∑ gnom√™, or sententious maxim, as a form of enthymeme), Quintilian,Institutes of Oratory, 8.5 and other classical authorities. Early modern English writers, heavily influenced by various humanist educational practices, such as harvesting commonplaces, were especially attracted to sententiae. The technique of sententious speech is exemplified by Polonius' famous speech to Laertes in Hamlet.Act 1, scene 3 Sometimes in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama the sententious lines appear at the end of scenes in rhymed couplets (for instance, John Webster's Duchess of Malfi). In some early modern dramatic texts and other writings, sententiae are often flagged by marginal notes or special marks.G.K.

It occurs when a circular yellow light is displayed to a movement with permissive left turns, while at the same time, opposing through traffic still has a circular green light. Some drivers facing the circular yellow (then red) lights will assume the opposite direction faces the same color display, and that oncoming traffic will stop. This leads to potential traffic conflict if drivers attempt to complete a left turn when it is not safe to do so. The left-turning driver may legally be at fault, for failure to yield, but made an understandable mistake. Solutions to the yellow trap include the flashing yellow arrow, Dallas phasing, Arlington phasing, simultaneously ending both through movements (circular green lights change to yellow, then red) before serving both left-turn movements (green arrows), or prohibiting one of the two left-turn movements. Many agencies in North America routinely allow the yellow trap, especially during emergency vehicle preemption, despite clear prohibition from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The MUTCD allows this sequence only if a sign reading Oncoming Traffic Has Extended Green or Oncoming Traffic May Have Extended Green is posted. Some of this stems from difficulties programming older traffic signal control software to prevent the yellow trap, but much stems from traffic engineers or technicians not understanding the yellow trap hazard, or believing it is not a serious problem. In left-hand traffic, the same scenario is applicable for drivers turning right.

It‚Äôs formed by Manchester Black (who is just a normal human in this version, though he has at times used enhanced weaponry or armor), along with Menagerie (who is bonded with a serpentine alien symbiote), Hat (an alien whose hat has 5th Dimension properties), and Morae that's nicknamed \\"Mo\\" in response to the bigotry of Ben Lockwood and the Children of Liberty as well as the ineffectiveness of the government and D.E.O. Manchester recruits Menagerie and Hat while in jail and they break out alongside the unnamed Morae. Believing that the government can‚Äôt be trusted and superheroes will not stop killers who don‚Äôt share their principles, they set out to kill the Children of Liberty and anyone else who would harm earthbound aliens, daring Supergirl to challenge them. They steal Brainiac 5's Legion Ring for Manchester Black and attempt to have the Claymore satellite - originally created to destroy alien ships within Earth's vicinity - fire at the White House. Menagerie is captured before an assassination attempt on Lockwood and the remaining members steal equipment from the Fortress of Solitude which they use to incite violence at a peaceful alien protest against an anti-alien rally where Mo and Hat are captured. In the episode \\"Stand and Deliver,\\" Manchester Black is killed by Martian Manhunter while the rest of the Elite are arrested by the D.E.O. Due the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths rewriting reality, the Elite may be back; other deceaaed or incarcerated villains are also back on Earth-Prime. * The Elite appeared in Superman vs. The Elite, with Manchester Black voiced by Robin Atkin Downes, Vera Black voiced by Marcella Lentz-Pope, Coldcast voiced by Catero Colbert, Menagerie voiced by Melissa Disney, and Hat voiced by Andrew Kishino. The Elite is initially better received than Superman by the public for simply killing superpowered criminals, thus providing instant results after Atomic Skull escaped and went on a killing spree. However, the Elite grow to become darker and eventually tyrannical over the course of weeks and appear to kill Superman when he opposes them. After Superman returns and defeats them in a terrifying rampage, seeming to slaughter them without mercy as he tells them that he‚Äôs going to do things their way now, he reveals that he actually showed mercy and simply disabled the Elite's powers. Public opinion switches back to Superman.

History It was built under Austrian rule, between 1908 and 1912, and bears the hallmark of architects Ruggero and Arduino Berlam. The synagogue was unveiled in 1912 in the presence of municipal officials, and it replaced the four smaller ones (Scholae) that previously existed, from mid 18th century, and which were based on an architectural model quite common in the North-East of Italy, with rectangular rooms with rows of pews orientated towards the centre or the eastern side; inside, they were delicately decorated and furnished but showed a humble and anonymous aspect from the outside. The Great Temple was meant to satisfy the religious need of a growing Community that, in 1938, had almost 6,000 members. For its construction an international contest was organized, but it had no results. The synagogue was closed in 1942 following the instigation of the race laws under the Fascist regime. It was devastated by fascist squads and later, during the Nazi occupation, it was used as a storehouse for works of art and books seized from the Jewish houses. The ritual silvers of the Community were preserved from the plunder thanks to a clever hiding place inside the very building. As soon as the war finished the synagogue went back into operation. Today it is recognised as one of the largest and most important places of worship for Jews in Europe. Interior The size and structure of the building clearly define it as a synagogue of the emancipation period, in which the main prayer room, with a rectangular floor plan, divides itself into three naves ending with the majestic apse and its vault with golden mosaic. The whole room is orientated towards a monumental ar√≤n with copper doors, surmounted by an pink granite aedicule which sustains the tables of the law with four columns. At its sides, two big menor√≤t, bronze candelabra with seven branches, leaning on a marble balustrade with wheatsheaf, symbols of the Community of Trieste. On the ceiling, elegant pendants, banded decorations edging the dome with geometrical patterns, trees and stars and other bands on the great arches quoting verses from the book of the Psalms and showing trees of life. Above the ar√≤n, on three sides, the beautiful balcony which used to be the women‚Äôs gallery and that, nowadays, is not used anymore because of security reasons and the small dimensions of the Community. In this gallery, above the entrance door and under a barrel vault, there is a big organ with pipes framed by stars of David. Architectural style Different architectural styles have successfully blended into this building, whose essence is represented by four powerful marble pillars supporting an imposing central dome. The style has been described as follows: References * Jewish Community of Trieste Official website *Synagogues of Europe, P. 372, Carole Herselle Krinsky Category:Synagogues in Italy Category:Orthodox synagogues in Italy Category:Buildings and structures in Trieste Category:Synagogues completed in 1912 ","title":"Synagogue of Trieste"},{"id":"4514327","text":"G.I.

Under President D√≠az, a military hero against the French Intervention in Mexico, the Federal Army was composed of senior officers who had served in long ago conflicts. At the time of the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution most were old men and incapable of leading men on the battlefield. When the rebellions broke out against D√≠az following fraudulent elections of 1910, the Federal Army was incapable of responding.Christon Archer, \\"Military, 1821-1914\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 2, p. 909. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. Although revolutionary fighters helped bring Francisco I. Madero to power, Madero retained the Federal Army rather than the revolutionaries. Madero used the Federal Army to suppress rebellions against his government by Pascual Orozco and Emiliano Zapata. Madero placed General Victoriano Huerta as interim commander of the military during the Ten Tragic Days of February 1913 to defend his government. Huerta changed sides and ousted Madero's government. Rebellions broke out against Huerta's regime. When revolutionary armies succeeded in ousting Huerta in July 1914, the Federal Army ceased to exist as an entity.Archer, \\"Military,\\" p. 910. Overview In February 1912, the Federal army consisted of 32,594 regulars and 15,550 irregulars. This was far below the official number of 80,000 as stated by the army executive. By September of the same year the official strength of the army was 85,000 men. In addition there were 16,000 Rurales, 4,000 Urban Police and 16,200 Militia, rural guards and other pro-government men under arms. In April 1914 Huerta claimed his army had reached the size of 250,000 men, with 31 regiments of Rurales and 31,000 Militia. A more realistic assessment of his men by that July was 71,000, while U.S. observers said it was closer to 40,000. Specific numbers aside, the rapid expansion of the army had led to a deterioration in the quality of the average recruit, or more accurately, conscript. Huerta made an attempt to increase the size of the army by ordering a mass levy, or forced conscription from the streets by his press-gangs, who would fall upon men as they left church or pull them from cinemas. Very few of the men under his command were volunteers and many deserted the army. Huerta tried improving morale by increasing pay in May 1913 by 50%. At the same time 382 military cadets were given commissions and attempts were made to increase the number in training. Federal army generals were often corrupt and guilty of undermining morale with poor leadership. Some were so corrupt their dealings extended as far as selling ammunition, food and uniforms to the enemy. Also guilty of this corruption were Huerta's two sons, Victoriano Jr. and Jorge, both of whom had been placed in important positions overseeing the procurement of arms, supplies, uniforms and ammunition. Despite these problems Huerta worked at creating an army capable of keeping him in power. He tried to expand the army by creating new units to distance them from the defeatism of the former Porfirista army. To bolster the resolve of the population he militarized society in the Prussian style, including military-style uniforms for all government employees and schoolboys and military drills on Sundays. Huerta and his general also sent 31 cadets to Europe to study military aviation in order to increase Mexico's air power. Huerta's greatest success was attracting the support of many former rebels, such as Benjamin Argumedo, \\"Cheche\\" Campos and, most notably, Pascual Orozco, whom Huerta had fought against when serving Madero's government. Orozco offered Huerta the services of his 3,000‚Äì4,000 seasoned men, who proved essential in the fight against the Constitutionalist armies. When not helping the defense of Federal garrisons and towns, Orozco's men acted as very effective guerrillas. The Federal Army was disbanded on August 13, 1914, a month after Huerta's exile. \\"Totally discredited, the old Federal army had come to the end of its run. Unable to control the Zapatistas, the Villistas, and other rebels, following the expulsion of Huerta, the Federist force disbanded and disappeared.\\"Archer, \\"Military,\\" p. 910. At the time the full strength of the Federal army was 10 Generals of Division, 61 Generals of Brigade, 1,006 Jefes, 2,446 Officers, 24,800 other ranks and 7,058 horses. In addition there were 21 regiments of Rurales with 500 men in each, a total of 10,500 men. The Federal army was replaced by the Constitutional Army of Venustiano Carranza under the terms of the Teoloyucan Treaties, although they too were known as Federales after Huertas's defeat.

He served as the head football coach at Pennsylvania State University (1915‚Äì1917), Colgate University (1922‚Äì1925), Western Maryland College, now McDaniel College (1926‚Äì1934), and Harvard University (1935‚Äì1942, 1945‚Äì1947), compiling a career college football record of 149‚Äì69‚Äì17. Harlow pioneered modern defensive schemes. Often fielding undersized teams, he pioneered coordinated stunts to get around or between blockers rather than trying to overpower them. His offenses were based on deception and timing rather than power, utilizing shifts, reverses, and lateral passes. Harlow was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954. Playing career A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Harlow attended Pennsylvania State University. As a tackle at Penn State, Harlow distinguished himself during the 1910 and 1911 seasons. A two-year letterman, he also was a member of the baseball and track and field teams. Harlow was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Coaching career Penn State Upon graduation from Penn State, Harlow remained with the Nittany Lions football team as an assistant coach for three seasons and was named head coach in 1915. After compiling a 20‚Äì8 record in three seasons, Harlow entered the military in 1918. During the fall of 1918, he was stationed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, where he coached the football team. After an honorable discharge from the United States Army, Harlow returned to Penn State in 1919 to assistant Hugo Bezdek with the football team. Harlow also took charge of boxing at Penn State. Colgate Harlow went on to become the 20th head coach at Colgate University from 1922 to 1925. His overall coaching record at Colgate was 24‚Äì9‚Äì3. At Colgate, he coached his team to a 55‚Äì0 victory over , where for a period of time the opposing team refused to tackle any Colgate ball carrier and Colgate scored several times in a row. Western Maryland Harlow was the head football coach at Western Maryland College, now known as McDaniel College, from 1926 to 1934. At Western Maryland, then of only 500 students, Harlow coached the Green Terror to a 60‚Äì13‚Äì7 record with three undefeated seasons.http://www.mcdanielathletics.com/sports/fball/history/ybyhttp://www.mcdanielathletics.com/sports/fball/history/yby- stats/histresu.htm#RESULTS.ALL In 1934 Western Maryland was invited to play in the inguinal Orange Bowl. Seeing it as not much of a challenge; Harlow declined to have his players play in then more prestigious East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. In Orange Bowl, Bucknell, who lost to the Green Terror early that season, beat the Miami Hurricanes.Lighter, James E. Fearless and Bold. Westminster: McDaniel College, 2007. 334. Print. Harlow had many great players such as Eugene \\"Stoney\\" Willis, who threw the first shovel pass against Boston College in 1932, and Bill Shepherd, who was considered to be one of the best running backs in the country in the early 1930s, starring the East West shrine game in 1934 behind Michigan center Gerald Ford. At Western Maryland, Harlow also coached Rip Engle. He had a great influence on Engle's career, and they remained good friends for many years. Harlow said that his \\"biggest thrill\\" came from those games where he beat Bosten College and Bucknell by such a lopsided margin. Harvard In 1935, Harlow became the first non-alumnus ever to coach at Harvard. It was there Harlow was voted Coach-of-the-Year in 1936 and a year later was chosen as the Ivy League Coach-of-the-Year. He retired in 1947 with a lifetime record of 149‚Äì69‚Äì17, and was named to the National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. Oology Harlow was an expert in oology, the study of birds' eggs. In 1939, he was named curator of oology at the Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, and he remained in that position until 1954.

Lofty is generally depicted as a meek, luckless and hapless victim. A long-running storyline concerns his relationship with the character Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Lofty departed in the episode that was first broadcast on 19 April 1988. Watt's return to the soap for a single episode was announced in December 2018. He returned for the funeral of Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton) in episode 5871, originally broadcast on 19 February 2019. Storylines George Holloway, nicknamed \\"Lofty\\" due to his above average height, serves in the army but has to leave because he suffers with chronic asthma; he settles in Walford and gets a job as a barman at The Queen Victoria public house. Lofty is devoted to his aunt Irene (Katherine Parr), who lives in a hospice, stricken with inoperable cancer. He takes on the task of caring and visiting her and is devastated when she eventually dies in 1987. He grows close to Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) after she becomes pregnant in 1985 and refuses to name the father: Lofty's employer, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), is the actual father although Lofty never discovers this. Michelle finds the prospect of bringing up a child daunting. Lofty struggles to see Michelle unhappy and chivalrously offers to marry her and help bring up her baby, Vicki, as his own. Although Michelle does not love Lofty, she accepts his proposal, realising that she can never be with her baby's real father. However, on their wedding day, Michelle is visited by Den in secret and this makes Michelle reconsider her options; she jilts Lofty at the altar, devastating him. When Michelle changes her mind months later, Lofty is overjoyed and sneaks Michelle away for a secret wedding. Money is sparse for the couple and Michelle is never truly happy; she quickly tires of Lofty. When Lofty begins pressuring Michelle to have a baby with him and to allow him to adopt Vicki, she is unwilling. She discovers that she is pregnant with Lofty's child and has an abortion. Lofty is devastated by Michelle's betrayal and their marriage breaks down. He grows depressed about losing the child he wanted so badly and amidst continued hostility with Michelle, he leaves Walford and take a job working as a handyman in a children's home in Bedfordshire, leaving in April 1988 with only Den witnessing his departure. It is subsequently revealed that Lofty has become a social worker. Over thirty years later in 2019, Lofty returns for the funeral of Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), where he reunites with old friends, Dot Branning (June Brown), Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), and Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), and explains that he now owns 15 pubs across London. They reminisce and before leaving, Lofty hands Michelle's brother, Martin Fowler (James Bye), a cheque for ¬£20,000 to be given to Vicki.  Creation  Lofty is one of the original 23 characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Both felt that to help complete the community there was a need for a character in his early twenties. He had to be someone a bit different. Not brash and confident like a lot of the older men, and not boisterous like the younger ones. A loner, maybe someone forced to be a loner. A person who \\"stuck out like a sore thumb\\". Someone that was happiest in a group but still couldn't find one that he fit in with. Tony Holland had previously been in the army and found that ex-soldiers had these problems when they tried to reintegrate as civilians. So they decided that Lofty would be an ex-soldier, forced to quit because of his asthma. He was happiest in the army and felt incomplete without the group setting, the all-male camaraderie and even the security of the uniformity that the army provides. Lofty's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. :\\"Born of a working-class London family, which was very respectable: Church of England and ex-army...Lofty grew up in a house where his father was only really happy when reminiscing about his army days and his mother was ultra-possessive and narrow minded...His friends were always vetted...He grew up to despise his mother and have a tolerant pity for his father...His best moments came in the Boy Scouts, the summer camp, and the feeling of belonging...On his eighteenth birthday, he walked into an army careers office and from then until the age of twenty-one had the happiest years of his life in the RASC...He adored the army ‚Äì It gave him a uniform, and set the limits...Then the shock ‚Äì he was discovered to be physically unfit...Dormant asthma...He was invalided out of the service...And, he had no taste for civilian life...His Auntie Irene (now in a hospice) secured the flat above Ethel Skinner's for Lofty...He misses the security of the Army...He works in the pub ‚Äì cash in hand.\\" (page 60) The invention of Lofty had been an afterthought, and during the casting he was still considered as something of an \\"enigma\\" to the creators and writers alike. This had made casting difficult as Holland and Smith were unsure about what they were looking for. The actor Tom Watt was suggested by one of the writers. Holland and Smith liked that his physical appearance (gauche and childlike) made him stand out (they likened him to the accident-prone sitcom character, Frank Spencer). It was decided that these attributes fitted the character perfectly and Watt was subsequently cast in the role. Development The BBC's official EastEnders website describes Lofty as \\"a mug although a lovable one\\". In 1987, Bob Shields of the Evening Times described Lofty as a \\"portable funeral\\". He added, \\"Beneath the facade of his National Health glasses smoulders the fire and passion of a cold toilet seat.\\" One of the most notable storylines Lofty was involved with was his marriage to the teenage mother, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Michelle and Lofty's church wedding was a massive target of press speculation before the episodes aired. They wanted to know two things, firstly the design of Michelle's dress, and secondly whether or not she would jilt Lofty at the altar. Anticipating a press furore, it was decided to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and security men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were parked in front of the entrance to the church so that nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried to gain access to the grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were really extras needed inside the church. The entire episode was written by David Ashton, and was devoted to Lofty and Michelle's wedding day. At the time it was deemed as one of the best cliffhangers of the series, with the episode ending as the bride arrives at the church door and hesitates. Michelle and Lofty's eventual marriage helped to consolidate a fast-growing audience. The young couple had come together under enormously difficult circumstances. The subsequent storylines were purposefully built to keep the audience guessing about the future of their relationship. Were they married for the wrong reasons? Would the relationship survive? and what would happen if Lofty wanted a child that was their own? The character remained in the show for three years, and eventually departed in 1988 when the actor decided to move on. On screen, Lofty, heart-broken after Michelle's abortion, moves on to become a handyman in a children's home. In 2009, when asked if there was a chance he would return as Lofty, Watt told Patrick McLennan of What's on TV: \\"I get the feeling that people think I'm ashamed of EastEnders; like it's some dirty thing in my past. But I had a fantastic time on that show and Lofty was loved by nobody more than the person who played him. I cannot think of anybody who had a better character to play. But I haven't been beating a path to their door, they haven't been beating a path to mine.\\" The BBC confirmed that Watt would reprise his role as Lofty, alongside Linda Davidson as Mary Smith, over thirty years since they departed, on 18 December. The characters return for the funeral of original character Doctor Legg (Leonard Fenton), who returned to the soap in 2018. Lofty appears in one episode broadcast in 2019. Executive consultant John Yorke invited Watt to reprise the role and described Lofty as a \\"huge iconic characters, and a central part of the show's DNA\\". He added that he was excited to have the characters return for one episode. Watt was pleased to be invited back to the soap and thought that it was \\"fitting\\" that Lofty returns for Doctor Legg's funeral. He commented, \\"I have nothing but good memories from my time on EastEnders so it will be lovely to set foot back in Albert Square all these years later.\\" Reception In 1988, actor Kevin Kennedy who played Curly Watts in soap opera Coronation Street, which was EastEnders' biggest television rival, criticised the character of Lofty. Kennedy claimed that Lofty was a direct copy of his character Curly: \\"As far as i'm concerned, Lofty was a straight lift. It really annoyed me when I saw it. Lofty even had the same hairstyle and glasses as Curly, he had the same caring but dithering nature. It was a perfect copy.\\" Curly first appeared in Coronation Street in 1983, just under two years before Lofty first appeared in EastEnders in 1985. Steve Tooze of the Daily Mirror branded the character a \\"daft, clueless geek who married 'Chelle Fowler, even though she was pregnant with Dirty Den's baby, and was duly dumped for his kind-heartedness.\\" References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional British Army personnel Category:Television characters introduced in 1985 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Lofty Holloway"},{"id":"4514408","text":"Felicistas were the supporters of F√©lix D√≠az, nephew of former president Porfirio Diaz, who opposed the Madero and Carranza governments in Mexican rebellions between 1913 and 1920.

It was completed in 1914 in a neo-gothic style. History The construction of the church was conducted in very specific phases, many of which are attributable to the priest in charge of the church at a given time. 1856‚Äì1891: Le√≥n de Jes√∫s Castillo In 1855, one year after the city of Nueva San Salvador was founded, Colonel Le√≥n Castillo started constructing a church dedicated to the Lady of El Carmen. Le√≥n Castillo had been active in armies under the command of General Francisco Moraz√°n. Records refer to him as a courageous soldier. His military career had been characterised by his commitment to liberal reform, something illustrated with his involvement in the expulsion of religious orders from El Salvador and the expropriation of churches since 1829, which is the year in which the liberal revolution began in Central America. The legend says that in 1840, Le√≥n Castillo was injured during combat in Guatemala and managed to crawl to Iglesia del Carmen del Cerrito, where he promised to the Lady of El Carmen that if she saved his life, he would work his whole life to propagate her faith and he would build a temple for her. He was taken care of by the priest Antonio Larrazabal, and he lived in the temple for almost two years. Colonel Castillo was instructed in Catholic faith and sciences, before he finally could return to El Salvador. Le√≥n Castillo fulfilled his promise of reconstructing the chapel of Our Lady of El Carmen in the Church of la Merced in San Salvador after the earthquake of 1854. When a new capital was established in Nueva San Salvador after this earthquake, Le√≥n Castillo decided to erect the church of his dreams in the new city. Bishop Miguel Pineda y Salda√±a and Le√≥n Castillo chose a location for the church in the north of the city, near the current Bel√©n school. The construction of this chapel started 9 August 1856. When the construction was well under way, Le√≥n Castillo received an image of the Lady of El Carmen from Luis Batres, a friend who lived in Guatemala. This image was blessed and placed in the modest church by 11 April 1860. This building did not end up becoming Castillo's dream temple. He would have to wait and work hard to secure a larger piece of land elsewhere in the city and also obtain the necessary funding to build the church he wanted. The war of 1863 compelled Le√≥n Castillo to suspend construction to care for the wounded and the sick. He had also been working against the liberals to avoid the seminary next to Iglesia Concepci√≥n to be closed down and to prevent the forced emigration of the clerics. When the war ended, the Bishop helped Colonel Castillo restart the work of Iglesia Concepci√≥n. The sacristy was built, as well as two aisles parallel to the central aisle and the belfry. The walls in the ends and on the sides were made of talpetate and brick. The construction of the belfry was initiated and three bells were placed on the top. An entrance was also built under the belfry that led to the monastery of Capuchin friars. The first Capuchin priests arrived in the middle of 1864 and they were provisionally placed in the seminary of Iglesia Concepci√≥n. In 1866 Bishop Salda√±a gave the unfinished church to the Capuchin order. The new owners gave the temple the name of Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de Bel√©n, which was inaugurated on 1 March. Construction of the current Iglesia del Carmen In 1871, Le√≥n Castillo acquired more land to the north of the main plaza in the city in 3rd Street-West. He decided to construct the temple he had dreamed of here. For this, he needed to acquire more land and gradually he managed to purchase it from the land owners of the area. First from Don Gregorio Valle on 16 September 1873; then from Don Esteban V√°squez on 17 September; from Don Manuel Dub√≥n Rodr√≠guez on 20 October 1874; and finally, a fourth piece of land from Don Tom√°s Dub√≥n on 17 November 1877. The Iglesia del Carmen ended up being a bit larger than 5,000 square metres. The ecclesiastical license to build the new temple was granted by the episcopal edict on 23 November 1876. The one to set the first stone was Bishop Luis C√°rcamo y Rodr√≠guez on 27 November 1878. The construction was financed mostly by donations and raffles. Le√≥n Castillo managed to maintain construction work uninterruptedly. The Colonel died on 16 November 1891 and his body was buried under the first window of the left aisle. 1892‚Äì1894: PP. Bernal y Argueta Bishop Antonio P√©rez y Aguilar, who later became an archbishop, ordered Father Juan Jos√© Bernal to continue construction work on the church and also named him its chaplain. After two years of work, the central aisle was completely renovated. Father Jos√© E. Argueta was named the new chaplain of the church in 1883. Father Argueta continued leading the construction work. In 1894, the left chapel was finished and it was dedicated to the Sacred Family and to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. 1894‚Äì1916: P. Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez-Pe√±a Father Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez-Pe√±a made considerable changes of notable artistic quality in the main aisle of the church. He decided to make the roof of the central aisle higher, following the Gothic style. Father L√≥pez Pe√±a also ordered the construction of a bigger and newer image of Our Lady of El Carmen. He paid the artist 175 silver pesos. This image was placed over the primitive main altar. In 1897 the sacristy was inaugurated. In 1898 the right chapel was opened and dedicated to the Holy Trinity and Divine Providence. These were represented with the most valuable sculptures in the church, which were an inheritance from the colonial period and had been kept in San Salvador in Iglesia San Francisco which was demolished during the earthquake of 1873. The chapel of the Holy Trinity and Divine Providence was almost entirely financed by the contributions of Beatriz Orantes de Est√©vez, the Gallardo Family, and Do√±a Concha Morales Villase√±or. In 1899 Father L√≥pez-Pe√±a commissioned Pascasio Gonz√°lez to decorate the most visible part of the main altar, and to do so in an imitation of the Gothic style. In 1900 the brick pavement was opened and the new altar was inaugurated on 16 July. The old altar was moved to the chapel of the Sacred Family where the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was installed. In June 1904 decoration works were concluded in the chapel of the Holy Trinity. The convent on the north or the temple was also completed. In the end of the same year the zinc and wooden constructions of the facade were finished and also the towers designed by Jose Jerez. The carpenter Luz Molina and the artist Jos√© Ruiz accepted to direct the work charging no honoraries for their contribution. In 1941 the chaplain Jos√© Jerez became dissatisfied with the work in wood and he ambitiously redesigned the facade and towers. These plans never materialised, but the drawings have been conserved. Jos√© Jerez intentions were to construct a fabulous Gothic temple in stone and cement. The last part of the temple in 1904 was built under the direction of a board composed of well known personalities in Santa Tecla These personalities were: Enriqueta Fajardo de Araujo, Carmen Est√©vez, Gertrudis Orellana, Isabel Morales, Juana Olivares Salda√±a, Josefina Alcaine and Rosal√≠a Chavez. In 1910 the church's facade was completed. The bronze image of the Lady of El Carmen was dedicated 25 March. The artwork was donated by Recaredo Gallardo and his wife, Carmen Alvarado de Gallardo. Painting inside the sanctuary was concluded in 1913. This concluded the construction work started 37 years earlier by Le√≥n Castillo. Father L√≥pez-Pe√±a made further efforts to expand the convent; he eventually gave it to priests of the Society of Jesus, who have been responsible for the church since. From that point forward, a Jesuit priest has always been the chaplain of the church. The arrival of the Jesuits When the necessary canonical authorizations were granted, the priests of the Society of Jesus received the church and residence of El Carmen in January 1916. The sanctuary had to be repaired a little over a year later due to an earthquake. The painting and artistic restoration was performed by brother Fr√≠as S.J. He is the same artist who painted the image of the Lady of Guadalupe in the Gothic altar of the Salesian workshops of the School of Arts and Trades in Santa Tecla. The crucified Christ of the altar and the screen of the main gate as well as the confessional booths and pulpit were carved in these workshops. Young Jesuits Accept Vows Before 2001 The earthquakes of 2001 On 13 January and 11 February 2001, the territory of El Salvador was struck by two powerful earthquakes of 7.7 and 6.1 magnitudes in the Richter scale. These events completely damaged Iglesia del Carmen, prompting the Society of Jesus to initiate plans to raise funds to demolish the existing structure and begin building a new church. Public authorities in El Salvador have reportedly delayed this procedure because they want to make sure that the structures of the church cannot be rescued before they authorize the demolition of this cultural and historical milestone of Nueva San Salvador. The \\"El Carmen Project\\" is a non-profit foundation that has been set up by Universidad Centroamericana \\"Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as\\" to attract and administer donations for the reconstruction of the church.

Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria are the corpus of requirements that member states and prospective member states must meet to be allowed to participate in the Commonwealth of Nations. The criteria have been altered by a series of documents issued over the past eighty-two years. The most important of these documents were the Statute of Westminster (1931), the London Declaration (1949), the Singapore Declaration (1971), the Harare Declaration (1991), the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme (1995), the Edinburgh Declaration (1997), and the Kampala Communiqu√© (2007). New member states of the Commonwealth must abide by certain criteria that arose from these documents, the most important of which are the Harare principles and the Edinburgh criteria. The Harare principles require all member states of the Commonwealth, old and new, to abide by certain political principles, including democracy and respect for human rights. These can be enforced upon current members, who may be suspended or expelled for failure to abide by them. To date, Fiji, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe have been suspended on these grounds; Zimbabwe later withdrew. The foremost of the Edinburgh criteria requires new member states to have either constitutional or administrative ties to at least one current member state of the Commonwealth of Nations. Traditionally, new Commonwealth member states had ties to the United Kingdom. The Edinburgh criteria arose from the 1995 accession of Mozambique, at the time the only member state that was never part of the British Empire (in whole or part). The Edinburgh criteria have been reviewed, and were revised at the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, allowing the admission of Rwanda at the 2009 Meeting. History Founding documents Louis St. Laurent, the author of the London Declaration formula that laid out embryonic membership criteria. The formation of the Commonwealth of Nations is dated back to the Statute of Westminster, an Act of the British Parliament passed on 11 December 1931. The Statute established the independence of the Dominions, creating a group of equal members where, previously, there was one (the United Kingdom) paramount. The solitary condition of membership of the embryonic Commonwealth was that a state be a Dominion. Thus, the independence of Pakistan (1947), India (1947), and the Dominion of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) (1948) saw the three countries join the Commonwealth as independent states that retained the King as head of state. On the other hand, Burma (1948) and Israel (1948) did not join the Commonwealth, as they chose to become republics. In 1949, the Commonwealth chose to regard Ireland as no longer being a member when Ireland repealed the External Relations Act under which the King had played a role in its diplomatic relations with other states, although the Irish government‚Äôs view was that Ireland had not been a member for some years.Ireland‚Äôs status was a matter of controversy and debate between 1936 and 1949. With India on the verge of promulgating a republican constitution, the 1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference was dominated by the impending departure of over half of the Commonwealth's population. To avoid such a fate, Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent proposed that republics be allowed to remain in the Commonwealth, provided that they recognise King George VI as 'Head of the Commonwealth'. Known as the London Declaration, this agreement thus established the only formalised rule as being that members must recognise the Head of the Commonwealth. The arrangement prompted suggestions that other countries, such as France, Israel, and Norway, join. However, until Western Samoa joined in 1970, only recently independent countries would accede. Singapore Declaration The first statement of the political values of the Commonwealth of Nations was issued at the 1961 conference, at which the members declared that racial equality would be one of the cornerstones of the new Commonwealth, at a time when the organisation's ranks were being swelled by new African and Caribbean members. The immediate result of this was the withdrawal of South Africa's re-application, which it was required to lodge before becoming a republic, as its government's apartheid policies clearly contradicted the principle. Further political values and principles of the Commonwealth were affirmed in Singapore on 22 January 1971, at the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). The fourteen points clarified the political freedom of its members, and dictated the core principles of the Commonwealth: world peace, liberty, human rights, equality, and free trade. However, neither the terms nor the spirit of the Declaration were binding, and several openly flouted it; despite little conformity, only Fiji was ever expelled for breaching these tenets (on 15 October 1987, following the second coup of that year). Harare Declaration The Harare Declaration, issued on 20 October 1991 in Harare, Zimbabwe, reaffirmed the principles laid out in Singapore, particularly in the light of the ongoing dismantling of apartheid in South Africa. The Declaration put emphasis on human rights and democracy by detailing these principles once more: Millbrook Programme The Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, issued on 12 November 1995 at the Millbrook Resort, near Queenstown, New Zealand, clarified the Commonwealth's position on the Harare Declaration. The document introduced compulsion upon its members, with strict guidelines to be followed in the event of breaching its rules. These included but were not limited to expulsion from the Commonwealth. Adjudication was left to the newly created Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG). At the same CHOGM, the Programme was enforced for the first time, as Nigeria was suspended. On 19 December 1995, the CMAG found that the suspension was in line with the Programme, and also declared its intent on enforcing the Programme in other cases (particularly Sierra Leone and The Gambia). On 29 May 1999, the day after the inauguration of Nigeria's first democratically elected President since the end of military rule, Olus·∫πgun ·ªåbasanj·ªç, the country's suspension was lifted, on the advice of the CMAG. Edinburgh criteria In 1995, Mozambique joined the Commonwealth, becoming the first member state to have never had a constitutional link with the United Kingdom or another Commonwealth member state. Concerns that this would allow open-ended expansion of the Commonwealth and dilute its historic ties prompted the 1995 CHOGM to launch the Inter- Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership, to report at the 1997 CHOGM, to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland. The group decided that, in future, new member states would be limited to those with constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member state. In addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single document. They had been prepared for the High Level Appraisal Group set up at the 1989 CHOGM, but not publicly announced until 1997. These requirements, which remain the same today, are that members must: *accept and comply with the Harare principles. *be fully independent sovereign states. *recognise Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of the Commonwealth. *accept the English language as the means of Commonwealth communication. *respect the wishes of the general population vis- √†-vis Commonwealth membership. Kampala review On the advice of Secretary-General Don McKinnon, the 2005 CHOGM, held in Valletta, Malta, decided to re-examine the Edinburgh criteria. The Committee on Commonwealth Membership reported at the 2007 CHOGM, held in Kampala, Uganda. According to Don McKinnon, the members of the Commonwealth decided in principle to expand the membership of the organisation to include countries without linkages to the Commonwealth, but Eduardo del Buey stated that it would still take some time until the criteria are reformed. Outstanding applications as of the 2007 meeting included former Belgian colony Rwanda (application submitted in 2003 and approved in 2009), the former French colonies of Algeria and Madagascar, and the former British colony of Yemen and condominium of Sudan.

It became the second country (after Mozambique) not to have any historical ties with the United Kingdom. Rwanda had been a colony of Germany in the 19th century and of Belgium for the first half of the 20th century. Later ties with France were severed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. President Paul Kagame also accused it of supporting the killings and expelled a number of French organisations from the country. Since the end of the genocide, English has increased in use. Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Tun Razak stated that Rwanda's application \\"was boosted by its commitment towards democracy as well as the values espoused by the Commonwealth\\". Consideration for its admission was also seen as an \\"exceptional circumstance\\" by the Commonwealth Secretariat.

The surname was also given to someone who lived close to a fish weir on a river. It is therefore a topographical type surname as well as an occupational type surname. In Ireland it is the anglicized form of Gaelic √ì Brad√°in 'descendant of Brad√°n', a personal name meaning ‚Äòsalmon‚Äô. This name was sometimes translated into English as Salmon or Fisher. The Celtic name Mac an Iascair in Ireland or MacInesker in Scotland also translates to Fisher. The German version of the surname is Fischer, the Dutch version is Visser and the Italian version is Pescatore - which is derived from the Latin surname Piscator. The Fisher motto is \\"Respice finem\\" which means \\"Regard the End\\".  History  The version of the surname spelt as Fischer was first recorded in Essex in 1263 when Richard le Fischer was recorded in the Feet of Fines. Surnames were created in England at that time due to the introduction of personal taxes known at that time as Poll Tax. Versions of the surname were extensively recorded shortly after this throughout Europe and included the surnames de Fisshar‚Äô in 1296 and Fysser in 1344. Church records in London include the marriage of Annis Fisher in 1549.  Present day  The surname Fisher is widely found throughout the world today. In the UK, it is the 94th most common surname. For every million people in the UK, approximately 1 208 have the surname Fisher. The surname Fischer is the fourth most popular surname in Germany.  Notable people  A *Aaron R.

The film marked Frankie Howerd's second and final appearance in the series. He stars alongside regular players Sid James, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Terry Scott and Bernard Bresslaw. Kenneth Williams is unusually absent, this is due to him rehearsing for his new BBC show, International Cabaret . Kenneth Connor returns to the series for the first time since Carry On Cleo six years earlier and would now feature in almost every entry up to Carry On Emmannuelle in 1978. Jacki Piper makes the first of her four appearances in the series. This movie is a send-up of the classic Tarzan films. Plot Camp ornithologist Professor Inigo Tinkle (Frankie Howerd) tells a less-than-enraptured audience about his most recent ornithological expedition to the darkest, most barren regions of the African wilds in search for the legendary Oozlum bird, which is said to fly in ever decreasing circles until it disappears up its own rear end. Financing the expedition is Lady Evelyn Bagley (Joan Sims) and the team are led by the fearless (and lecherous) Bill Boosey (Sid James) and his slow-witted African guide Upsidasi (Bernard Bresslaw in blackface). Also on the expedition is Tinkle's idiotic assistant, Claude Chumley (Kenneth Connor) and June (Jacki Piper), Lady Bagley's beautiful but unappreciated maidservant. The journey does not get off to a good start, with a mad gorilla terrorising the campsite and the travellers' realising they have ventured into the territory of the bloodthirsty \\"Noshas\\", a tribe of feared cannibals. On the first night of the expedition, at dinner Lady Bagley reveals that she has embarked on the journey to find her long-lost husband and baby son who vanished twenty years ago on their delayed honeymoon, whilst out on a walk. Her husband is believed to have been eaten by a crocodile, but she hopes to find her baby son, Cecil's, nappy pin as something to remember him by. What the group do not know is that watching them from the bushes is Ug (Terry Scott), a bungling yet compassionate Tarzan-like jungle dweller that wears a loincloth and sandals. Ug has never before seen any other white people, especially a woman. The next day, June stumbles across a beautiful oasis where she saves Ug from drowning and the two begin to fall in love. That night, Ug wanders into camp and encounters Lady Bagley in her tent (mistaking it for June's tent) and she is astonished to see that Ug is wearing Cecil's nappy pin, and that Ug is in fact her lost son Cecil. But before they can be reunited, Ug flees in fear and Lady Bagley faints with shock. The next day, the travellers are kidnapped by the Noshas, but manage to bribe their way out of being cannibalised by giving the tribal witch doctor Tinkle's pocket watch. Tinkle however delays and promises the witch doctor that their gods will bestow a sign of thanks upon them. Intending rescue, Ug accidentally catapults himself into the Nosha camp and starts a fire. In the chaos, Ug, June and Upsidasi manage to escape but the enraged Noshas apprehend the other travellers and prepare to kill them. As they wait to be put to death, they are suddenly rescued by the all-female Lubby-Dubby tribe led by the stunning Leda (Valerie Leon) from the Lost World of Aphrodisia. They are taken to Aphrodisia and meet the king of the tribe Tonka who turns out to be Lady Bagley's missing husband Walter Bagley (Charles Hawtrey) who was taken by the Noshas years ago, but saved and brought to Aphrodisia by the tribal women. Evelyn Bagley is infuriated that he never bothered to search for their missing son and laments she has seen him but has once again lost him. June and Ug are revealed to be living happily together and June is teaching Ug to speak English. Bill Boosey, Prof. Tinkle and Chumley enjoy the attention given to them by the tribal women, and Tinkle and Chumley are stunned to find that their elusive Oozlum Bird is in fact a sacred animal to the Lubby-Dubby females. It transpires that the Lubby-Dubbies need the menfolk to save themselves from extinction, as no males have been born in Aphrodisia for over a century. The men think their dreams have come true....until Leda makes it clear that the Lubby-Dubby women have no intention of letting them go. Tonka implies that the last man who tried to escape Aphrodisia was murdered by the tribe. Lady Bagley is resentful of this work the men have been given and taking over control from her husband (Tonka) ensure the mates assigned to the men are masculine looking and unattractive! Three months pass and the men now are fed up and Leda is outraged that none of their \\"mates\\" have gotten pregnant so she overthrows Tonka and assumes his place, threatening harm to the men. However Upsidasi arrives disguised as a woman and says he has brought soldiers to save them. Ug and June also search for their friends and Ug summons a stampede of animals to create chaos and enable the men to get away. During the confusion, Tinkle snatches the Oozlum Bird and the team escape along with Tonka. After the chaos, Leda and her army chase after the men, but are more interested in the trampled soldiers. She says to let the others go not needing them now that they have \\"some real men.\\" Lady Bagley is reunited with her beloved son and the group return to England. Tinkle unveils his Oozlum Bird to his audience....only to find it vanished up inside itself. June and Ug are happily married with a baby, and live in a treehouse in the suburbs whilst Ug goes to work in a bowler hat, suit, and no shoes.

Isis or Hera is the first, and only, known Cylon-Human hybrid child to be born and she first appears in the episode \\"Downloaded\\". She is the daughter of the Cylon Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon and human father Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon. They name her \\"Hera\\" after the Colonial goddess. Background and details The humanoid Cylons are as biological as they are technological and can potentially mate with humans and produce offspring. This fact seems to be part of the \\"plan\\" of the Cylons who want to repopulate the human colonies with a new generation of hybrid beings. Once the Cylons learn of Athena's pregnancy, they decide the child must be protected at all costs and thus have impact on the Cylon agenda in pursuing the refugee fleet. Hera is believed to be the only successful hybrid born, which is believed to be due to the love between her parents. Attempts at producing hybrids in \\"farms\\" on the occupied Colonies have all presumably failed in the early stages of gestation, if they ever got that far. Fearing that Cylon spies within the fleet would try to kidnap Hera, the President Laura Roslin of the Fleet secretly orders Dr. Cottle to fake the child's death. Hera had been born with underdeveloped lungs and Cottle uses this fact as the cause of her death. Sharon, however, refuses to believe this and accuses Cottle of having murdered her child on Roslin's or Admiral Adama's orders. Later, while Helo and Chief Tyrol scatter ashes into space that they believe are Hera's, Roslin and Cottle secretly meet on Colonial One and give Hera to a woman named Maya who had lost a child in a previous Cylon attack. Emphasizing the need for secrecy, Roslin's aide Tory Foster tells Maya that the baby's mother is an anonymous Pegasus officer who cannot care for the child due to political and religious reasons. Maya subsequently names the baby Isis. After a year on New Caprica, Isis is still alive. She had been under the care of Maya, who works with Roslin in a New Caprica school. Roslin tries to keep Isis and her adoptive mother hidden (see Exodus, Part 1). However, Maya is killed during the evacuation of New Caprica (in the episode Exodus, Part 2). Hera is taken into the custody of Number Three. During the race to Earth, Hera begins to get sick and her Cylon caretakers cannot determine what the problem is. During a Cylon diplomatic trip to Galactica, Boomer tells Hera's biological mother Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon that Hera is still alive and is sick (see The Eye of Jupiter). At Athena's request, her husband Helo shoots and kills her so that she can download to a new body in the Cylon fleet and attempt a rescue of her daughter (see Rapture). On download, Caprica-Six takes her to Hera, who is under Boomer's care. Hera appears to be comforted by her mother's presence. As Caprica-Six observes, despite Boomer and Athena being biologically identical, Hera can apparently distinguish between them, and she has missed her real mother. However, Athena also discovers that Hera's belly is very hard, indicating a possible blockage in her bowels, and advocates that Hera be examined by a human doctor aboard Galactica. With help from Caprica-Six, Athena and Hera escape to Galactica, where Hera is presumably examined by Doc Cottle. As a \\"hybrid\\", Hera/Isis possesses incredible regenerative properties. Some of her blood is donated to Laura Roslin, which helps treat her cancer to the point where she completely recovers (see \\"Epiphanies\\"). This fact leads to Laura's decision to not have Athena's fetus aborted as she had previously ordered. It is not yet known if Isis/Hera possesses any of the machine qualities of her mother, such as the fiberoptic neural pathways, and she is too young to determine if she has the superhuman physical prowess demonstrated by other humanoid Cylon models such as Leoben Conoy and Number Six. However, in Islanded in a Stream of Stars it is revealed that she possesses the Cylon ability to project (to inhabit an internally generated virtual environment and to share this environment with other Cylons). As previously mentioned, Hera can distinguish her mother apart from the other Number Eights, but whether this is attributed to a Cylon inherited ability or to the emotional bond between a mother and her child is unknown. In Someone to Watch Over Me, Hera gives Starbuck a drawing. Later, Starbuck realizes that the \\"stars\\" in Hera's drawing match up with the notes to \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" - the song that activated the Final Five. Hera is kidnapped by Boomer who arrives at the daycare dressed as her mother and then quickly drugs the little girl with a drink. Pretending to be Athena, Boomer smuggles Hera onto a Raptor inside a provisions container (Athena had planned to leave on an extended mission) and jumps away. In the final episode, it is revealed that Hera is apparently the Mitochondrial Eve and lived 150,000 years before the present day. Her remains (described as being those of a \\"young woman\\") are recovered by the Smithsonian Institution in modern-day Tanzania.

The decision was the result of a growing political debate known as the \\"chicken and egg war\\" where Quebec and Ontario enacted protectionist legislation for the egg and poultry industry preventing Manitoba from selling their eggs and poultry products in those provinces. To much of the public's surprise the Court struck down a provincial statute regulating the marketing of eggs. The case somewhat contradicted the precedent case of Carnation Co. v. Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board, [1968] S.C.R. 238 which held that provincial law that has an incidental effect on other provinces is still valid. The Court held that even though there was no direct evidence showing that there was extraprovincial effect of the provincial law, the potential effect was sufficient to find the law ultra vires. The Court found that control of imports was essential to the provincial legislative scheme even though the law made no distinction between eggs produced inside or outside of the province. The Court distinguished the case from the Carnation decision by the fact that the Manitoba regulations intended to provide regulation of inter-provincial trade while in Carnation the law only has the effect of regulating inter-provincial trade. In the aftermath of the decision, all 11 governments, the 10 governments of the provinces and the federal government, entered an agreement with the federal government which arranged a federal egg marketing scheme which created quotas for each of the provinces, and charged tariffs for eggs sold outside of the province.

Toponymy The town is named for the native Quepo Indians who inhabited the place in the colonial era. History The area was home to the native Quepoa people of this specific Costa Rican region. In 1563, Spanish Catholic conquistadores, led by Juan V√°zquez de Coronado, settled the area and founded the settlement of San Bernardino de Quepo. The local native Quepo people were then subsequently subjugated by Juan V√°zquez and his conquistadores. In 1746, the Quepo people that remained were transferred to a reservation which already contained another native ethnic group. Quepos offers fishing for numerous varieties of fish, especially Pacific Sailfish. Peak fishing season is from November to April for billfish.  Geography  Quepos has an area of km¬≤ and an elevation of metres. The town is about 60 km. south (in a straight line) from Costa Rica's capital, San Jos√©, but is 157 km from that city by road if going through the localities of Atenas, Orotina and T√°rcoles.

W. Tarn, was a British classical scholar and a writer. He wrote extensively on the Hellenistic world, particularly on Alexander the Great's empire and its successor states. Tarn has been criticized for romanticizing philhellenism, and using it to further his own racial colonial theories. He was a Fellow of the British Academy (1928). He was born in London and died in Muirtown. Works According to some, Tarn offered a somewhat idealistic interpretation of Alexander's conquests as being essentially driven by his vision of the \\"unity of mankind\\", in line with the interpretation of Plutarch (Alexander the Great, Vol. 1). In his outdated work 'Alexander the Great', Tarn offered a pedigree for Alexander which flips upside down the notion of a Macedonian or much less Greek lineage: \\"Alexander certainly had from his father (Philip II) and probably from his mother (Olympia) Illyrian, i.e., Albanian, blood.\\" Jeanne Reames remarked that \\"Tarn's portrait of Alexander turned the Greek conqueror into a proper Scottish gentleman (as was Tarn himself). Engaging in sometimes elaborate apologetics to explain away Alexander's questionable decisions, Tarn painted him as the original philosopher in armor, a chivalrous young king who brought higher Greek culture to the poor benighted barbarians.(...) [Tarn's] two-volume biography of Alexander and his article in the \\"Cambridge Ancient History\\" influenced the popular thinking of future generations even after in scholarly circles his theories had been torpedoed by Harvard's Ernst Badian. In fact, portrayals of Alexander in some high school and college world history text books still reflect Tarn more than anyone who has come after. Reames also saw Tarn's strong influence in Mary Renault's trilogy of historical novels about Alexander - though Renault's acknowledged Alexander's homo-erotic tendencies, while Tarn had regarded references to them in ancient sources as \\"defamations\\" which the Macedonian king had to be defended against.Beyond Renault - Mary Renault, Jeanne Reames reviews 3 books on Alexander the Great written by Renault Tarn also researched extensively on the history of the Greco-Bactrians and Indo-Greeks in his book The Greeks in Bactria and India. His work followed Osmund Bopearachchi's publication on the study of Indo-Greek coins. Publications * Antigonos Gonatas. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1913.

It was broadcast on PBS in 1990, to the largest viewing audience of the Ring Cycle in human history. James Morris was born in Baltimore, Maryland, where he studied voice with Rosa Ponselle and at the Peabody Conservatory. He attended the University of Maryland and also studied at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He made his debut with the Baltimore Opera in 1967, as \\"Crespel\\" in Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, which starred Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle. He first appeared in New York City at the Metropolitan Opera, in January 1971, as The King in Verdi's A√Øda. He went on to establish himself as one of the most versatile male opera singers in the world, performing a repertoire ranging from Mozart through Verdi and Wagner to Benjamin Britten. But of all the parts he has sung, Wotan arguably remains his signature role. He was considered one of the best Wotans in the world during his heyday. In January 2008, on his 61st birthday, he reprised that role in a production of Die Walk√ºre at the Metropolitan Opera, the theater with which he is most closely associated. In 2009, alongside Deborah Voigt, he also returned there to sing \\"Scarpia\\" in Puccini's Tosca. In addition to his imposing, well-trained voice and fine acting and musicianship, Morris, at 6 feet, 5 inches in height, had the physical stature to perform the heroic Wagnerian roles convincingly. His interpretations can be heard on a number of recordings that were made at the peak of his career.

He was taught to read and write, and became manager of supply and shipping for Joseph Emory Davis at Hurricane Plantation at Davis Bend. Early life Ben Montgomery was born into slavery in 1819 in Loudoun County, Virginia. In 1837, he was sold south, and purchased in Natchez, Mississippi by Joseph Emory Davis. The planter's much younger brother, Jefferson Davis, later became the President of the Confederate States of America.Hermann, Reconstruction in Microcosm (1980), p. 315. Montgomery escaped but was recaptured. Davis reportedly \\"inquired closely into the cause of his dissatisfaction\\", whereby the two men reached a \\"mutual understanding\\" about Montgomery's situation. Davis assigned Montgomery to run the general store of his plantation at Davis Bend.\\"Ben Montgomery\\", The Black Inventor Online Museum. Accessed December 6, 2012. It was unusual for a slave to serve in this position. Impressed with his knowledge and abilities to run the store, Davis placed Montgomery in charge of overseeing the entirety of his purchasing and shipping operations on the plantation. On May 21, 1847, Montgomery's son, Isaiah Montgomery, was born to him and his wife. Due to Ben's favored position among the Davis Bend slaves, Isaiah was also given the opportunity of receiving an education. Montgomery maintained a close relationship with his son up until his death.Isaiah Montgomery: Biography  Career  Montgomery learned a variety of skills, including reading, writing, land surveying, flood control, architectural design, machine repair, and steamboat navigation.Hermann, \\"Reconstruction in Microcosm\\" (1980), p. 316. Montgomery developed proficiencies in many areas; he became a skilled mechanic, not only repairing the advanced agricultural machinery acquired by the Davis brothers, but eventually applied for a patent for his design of a steam-operated propeller to provide propulsion to boats in shallow water. The propeller could cut into the water at different angles, thus allowing the boat to navigate more easily through shallow water. This was not a new invention, but an improvement on similar designs invented by John Stevens in 1804 and John Ericsson in 1838.() On June 10, 1858, on the basis that Ben, as a slave, was not a citizen of the United States, and thus could not apply for a patent in his name, he was denied this patent application in a ruling by the United States Attorney General's office. It ruled that neither slaves nor their owners could receive patents on inventions devised by slaves. Later, both Joseph and Jefferson Davis attempted to patent the device in their names but were denied because they were not the \\"true inventor.\\" After Jefferson Davis later was selected as President of the Confederacy, he signed into law the legislation that would allow slaves to receive patent protection for their inventions. On June 28, 1864, Montgomery, no longer a slave, filed a patent application for his device, but the patent office again rejected his application. Joseph Davis allowed captive Africans on his plantation to retain money earned commercially, so long as they paid him for the labor they would have done as farmworkers. Thus, Montgomery was able to accumulate wealth, run a business, and create a personal library.Hermann, \\"Reconstruction in Microcosm\\" (1980), p. 316\\\\. \\"Like all the Davis' slaves, Montgomery could keep whatever he earned beyond the equivalent of his worth as a field hand. Since his store prospered, counting among its customers the white planters and their families as well as the slaves, Ben was able to build a store building and living quarters near the landing at Hurricane.\\"  Ownership of Davis Bend  The Davis family left Davis Bend in 1862, ahead of oncoming troops from the Union Army. Montgomery assumed control of the plantation. Farming continued despite difficulties created by the war, such as attacks from the military forces of both sides.Hermann, \\"Reconstruction in Microcosm\\" (1980), p. 316. \\"When Joseph Davis and his family fled from the plantation in 1862, Benjamin Montgomery was left in charge of the house and grounds as well as the hundred or more slaves who were not taken along. For a year he supervised the production of corn and vegetables to provide subsistence for the black community. Wartime shortages led him to develop a tanning and shoe-making industry to supply their own needs and to provide a small income from the neighbors. In June 1862, the Union Navy raided and burned the mansion at Hurricane, and a few months later, despite Montgomery's protests, the Confederate Army burned the cotton crop. Life along the river became increasingly hazardous.\\" Following the end of the American Civil War, Joseph Davis sold his plantation and property to Montgomery, in 1866, for the sum of $300,000 as part of a long-term loan. In September 1867, Montgomery became the first Afro-American official elected in Mississippi, when he was elected justice of the peace of Davis Bend.Verney, \\"Trespassers\\" (2008), p. 68.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), pp. 129‚Äì130. \\"General Ord finally yielded to this pressure and asked Ben Montgomery if he could qualify for and would accept the office of justice of the peace at Davis Bend. Upon receipt of Ben's affirmative reply, Ord issued the required order on September 10. Montgomery told Davis that he has been pleased with the appointment of Huntington and regretted that the white man could not qualify. [...] Nineteen months later, in April 1869, John Roy Lynch was named justice of the peace at Natchez. This ambitious young freedman went on to the state and eventually the national legislature. Referring to his appointment as justice of the peace, Lynch claimed that it was 'the first time in the history of the state that a colored man had been commissioned to fill such an office.' Later Governor Adelbert Ames claimed that there was 'not a single colored man in office' when he appointed Lynch in 1869. These erroneous claims from people who lived so near Davis Bend show how successful the Montgomerys were at avoiding publicity.\\" Under his supervision, the plantation produced cotton judged to be the best in the world at an International Exposition in 1870. With his son Isaiah, Montgomery established a general store known as Montgomery & Sons. Montgomery worked toward his lifelong dream of establishing a community for freed slaves. He never lived to see his dream come to fruition. Catastrophic floods ruined the crops and cut a channel across the peninsula, turning Davis Bend into an island. This added to the expenses of getting supplies to the plantation and crops to market. When Montgomery failed to make a payment on the loan in 1876, Davis Bend automatically reverted to the Davis family as per the terms of the original contract. Heartbroken, Montgomery died the next year.  Legacy  After his father's death, Isaiah Montgomery worked to realize his dream. He purchased between the Vicksburg and Memphis railroad lines in northwest Mississippi for the purpose of establishing the community of freed slaves his father dreamed of. Along with other former slaves, Isaiah Montgomery established the town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi in 1887 and developed it as a majority African-American community.\\"The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow\\", Jim Crow Stories, People: Isaiah Montgomery PBS References  Sources  * Hermann, Janet Sharp.

The Academy is located in Beckley, West Virginia, on an site near the Raleigh County Airport. The Academy complex consists of nine buildings: The Residence Hall, Administration Building, Classroom Building, Mine Machinery Laboratory Building, Publication Distribution Center, Gymnasium, Maintenance and Equipment Building, Mine Emergency Operations Building, Mine Rescue Station and Mine Simulation Laboratory. Students are exposed to a variety of different disciplines in nine different laboratories: roof control, ground control, mine emergencies and rescue, ventilation, electrical systems, machinery, industrial hygiene, computer systems and underground mine simulation. History In a five-year period from 1906-1911, 13,228 miners were killed in U.S. coal mines. As a result, the Bureau of Mines was established by Congress on July 1, 1910, \\"to make diligent investigation of the methods of mining, especially in relation to the safety of miners and the appliances best adapted to prevent accidents.\\" In succeeding years, Congress passed other legislation designed to promote health and safety in the mines, including the 1966 Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act (P.L. 89-577) and the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-173). The most recent regulatory legislation combined the coal and metal and nonmetal industries under one law--the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. This act directed that \\"The National Mine Health and Safety Academy shall be...responsible for the training of mine safety and health inspectors, mining personnel, or other persons as the Secretaries of Labor and Interior shall designate. In performing this function, the Academy shall have the authority to enter into cooperative educational and training agreements with educational institutions, State governments, labor organizations, and mine operators and related industries.\\" It is through the training provisions of this legislation that the National Mine Health and Safety Academy functions. In response to the mandates of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, on September 7, 1971, the Academy began inspector training in temporary facilities in Beckley, West Virginia. On August 17, 1976, the permanent facility, situated on of land donated by the Raleigh County Airport Authority, opened its doors with an official dedication. Michael George Zabetakis was the first superintendent of the Academy.

He is one of the pioneers of the Arabic novel and drama. The triumphs and failures that are represented by the reception of his enormous output of plays are emblematic of the issues that have confronted the Egyptian drama genre as it has endeavored to adapt its complex modes of communication to Egyptian society. Early life Tawfiq Ismail al-Hakim was born October 9, 1898, in Alexandria, Egypt, to an Egyptian father and Turkish mother. His father, a wealthy and illustrious civil officer, worked as a judge in the judiciary in the village of al-Delnegat, in central Beheira province. His mother was the daughter of a retired Turkish officer. Tawfiq al-Hakim enrolled at the Damanhour primary school at the age of seven. He left primary school in 1915 and his father put him in a public school in the Beheira province, where Tawfiq al-Hakim finished secondary school. However, due to the lack of proper secondary schooling in the province, Tawfiq al-Hakim moved to Cairo with his uncles to continue his studies at Muhammad Ali secondary school. After studying in Cairo, he moved to Paris, where he graduated in law and began preparing a PhD thesis at the Sorbonne. However, his attention turned increasingly to the Paris theatres and the Opera and, after three years in Paris, he abandoned his studies and returned to Egypt in 1928, full of ideas for transforming Egyptian theatre. Egyptian drama before Tawfiq al-Hakim The cause of 'serious' drama, at least in its textual form, was in the process of being given a boost by one of the Egypt's greatest litt√©rateurs, Ahmed Shawqi, \\"Prince of Poets,\\" who during his latter years penned a number of verse dramas with themes culled from Egyptian and Islamic history; these included Masraa' Kliyubatra (The Death of Cleopatra, 1929), Majnun Layla (Driven mad by Layla, 1931), Amirat el-Andalus (The Andalusian Princess, 1932), and Ali Bey al-Kebir (an 18th-century ruler of Egypt), a play originally written in 1893 and later revised. However, between the popular traditions of farcical comedy and melodrama and the performance of translated versions of European dramatic masterpieces, there still remained a void within which an indigenous tradition of serious drama could develop.and the teez of anything War-time political writings During WWII, al-Hakim published many articles against Nazism and Fascism. The articles portrayed Hitler as a demon whose victory would herald the end of human civilization, bringing instead a \\"return to barbarism ... tribalism, and beastliness\\". Plays The publication and performance of his play, Ahl al- Kahf (The People of the Cave, 1933) was a significant event in Egyptian drama. The story of 'the people of the cave' is to be found in the eighteenth surah of the Qur'an as well as in other sources. It concerns the tale of the seven sleepers of Ephesus who, in order to escape the Roman persecution of Christians, take refuge in a cave. They sleep for three hundred years, and wake up in a completely different era - without realizing it, of course. In its use of overarching themes - rebirth into a new world and a predilection for returning to the past - al-Hakim's play obviously touches upon some of the broad cultural topics that were of major concern to intellectuals at the time, and, because of the play's obvious seriousness of purpose, most critics have chosen to emphasise such features. Within a year al-Hakim produced another major and highly revered work, Shahrazad (Scheherazade, 1934). While the title character is, of course, the famous narrator of the One Thousand and One Nights collection, the scenario for this play is set after all the tales have been told. Now cured of his vicious anger against the female sex by the story- telling virtuosity of the woman who is now his wife, King Shahriyar abandons his previous ways and embarks on a journey in quest of knowledge, only to discover himself caught in a dilemma whose focus is Shahrazad herself; through a linkage to the ancient goddess, Isis, Shahrazad emerges as the ultimate mystery, the source of life and knowledge. Even though the play is now considered one of his finest works, Taha Hussein, a prominent Arab writer and one of the leading intellectuals of the then Egypt criticized some of its aspects, mainly that it was not suitable for a theatrical performance. Later, the two writers wrote together a novel called The Enchanted Castle (Al-Qasr al-Mashur, 1936) in which both authors revisited some of the themes from al- Hakim's play. When the National Theatre Troupe was formed in Egypt in 1935, the first production that it mounted was The People of the Cave. The performances were not a success; for one thing, audiences seemed unimpressed by a performance in which the action on stage was so limited in comparison with the more popular types of drama. It was such problems in the realm of both production and reception that seem to have led al-Hakim to use some of his play-prefaces in order to develop the notion of his plays as 'th√©√¢tre des id√©es', works for reading rather than performance. However, in spite of such critical controversies, he continued to write plays with philosophical themes culled from a variety of cultural sources: Pygmalion (1942), an interesting blend of the legends of Pygmalion and Narcissus. Some of al-Hakim's frustrations with the performance aspect were diverted by an invitation in 1945 to write a series of short plays for publication in newspaper article form. These works were gathered together into two collections, Masrah al- Mugtama (Theatre of Society, 1950) and al-Masrah al-Munawwa (Theatre Miscellany, 1956). The most memorable of these plays is Ughniyyat al-Mawt (Death Song), a one-act play that with masterly economy depicts the fraught atmosphere in Upper Egypt as a family awaits the return of the eldest son, a student in Cairo, in order that he may carry out a murder in response to the expectations of a blood feud. Al-Hakim's response to the social transformations brought about by the 1952 revolution, which he later criticized, was the play Al Aydi Al Na'imah (Soft Hands, 1954). The 'soft hands' of the title refer to those of a prince of the former royal family who finds himself without a meaningful role in the new society, a position in which he is joined by a young academic who has just finished writing a doctoral thesis on the uses of the Arabic preposition hatta. The play explores in an amusing, yet rather obviously didactic, fashion, the ways in which these two apparently useless individuals set about identifying roles for themselves in the new socialist context. While this play may be somewhat lacking in subtlety, it clearly illustrates in the context of al-Hakim's development as a playwright the way in which he had developed his technique in order to broach topics of contemporary interest, not least through a closer linkage between the pacing of dialogue and actions on stage. His play formed the basis of a popular Egyptian film by the same name, starring Ahmed Mazhar. In 1960 al- Hakim was to provide further illustration of this development in technique with another play set in an earlier period of Egyptian history, Al Sultan Al- Ha'ir (The Perplexed Sultan ). The play explores in a most effective manner the issue of the legitimation of power. A Mamluk sultan at the height of his power is suddenly faced with the fact that he has never been manumitted and that he is thus ineligible to be ruler. By 1960 when this play was published, some of the initial euphoria and hope engendered by the Nasserist regime itself, given expression in Al Aydi Al Na'imah, had begun to fade. The Egyptian people found themselves confronting some unsavoury realities: the use of the secret police to squelch the public expression of opinion, for example, and the personality cult surrounding the figure of Gamal Abdel Nasser. In such a historical context al-Hakim's play can be seen as a somewhat courageous statement of the need for even the mightiest to adhere to the laws of the land and specifically a plea to the ruling military regime to eschew the use of violence and instead seek legitimacy through application of the law. A two volume English translation of collected plays is in the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works. Style and themes The theatrical art of al-Hakim consists of three types: 1- Biographical Theatre: The group of plays he wrote in his early life in which he expressed his personal experience and attitudes towards life were more than 400 plays among which were \\"al-Arees\\", (The Groom) and \\"Amama Shibbak al-Tazaker\\", (Before the Ticket Office). These plays were more artistic because they were based on Al Hakim's personal opinion in criticizing social life. 2- Intellectual Theatre: This dramatic style produced plays to be read not acted. Thus, he refused to call them plays and published them in separate books. Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq Alhakim in 1982 3- Objective Theatre: Its aim is to contribute to the Egyptian society by fixing some values of the society, exposing the realities of Egyptian life. Al-Hakim was able to understand nature and depict it in a style which combines symbolism, reality and imagination. He mastered narration, dialogue and selecting settings. While al-Hakim's earlier plays were all composed in the literary language, he was to conduct a number of experiments with different levels of dramatic language. In the play, Al-Safqah (The Deal, 1956), for example - with its themes of land ownership and the exploitation of poor peasant farmers - he couched the dialogue in something he termed 'a third language', one that could be read as a text in the standard written language of literature, but that could also be performed on stage in a way which, while not exactly the idiom of Egyptian Arabic, was certainly comprehensible to a larger population than the literate elite of the city. There is perhaps an irony in the fact that another of al-Hakim's plays of the 1960s, Ya tali al-Shajarah (1962; The Tree Climber, 1966), was one of his most successful works from this point of view, precisely because its use of the literary language in the dialogue was a major contributor to the non-reality of the atmosphere in this Theatre of the Absurd style involving extensive passages of non-communication between husband and wife. Al-Hakim continued to write plays during the 1960s, among the most popular of which were Masir Sorsar (The Fate of a Cockroach, 1966) and Bank al-Qalaq (Anxiety Bank, 1967). Influence and impact on Arabic literature Tawfiq al-Hakim is one of the major pioneer figures in modern Arabic literature. In the particular realm of theatre, he fulfills an overarching role as the sole founder of an entire literary tradition, as Taha Hussein had earlier made clear. His struggles on behalf of Arabic drama as a literary genre, its techniques, and its language, are coterminous with the achievement of a central role in contemporary Egyptian political and social life. Hakim's 1956 play Death Song was the basis of the libretto to Mohammed Fairouz's 2008 opera Sumeida's Song. Rase, Sherri (April 8, 2011), Conversations‚Äîwith Mohammed Fairouz , [Q]onStage, retrieved 2011-04-19 Personal life Hakim was viewed as something of a misogynist in his younger years, having written a few misogynistic articles and remaining a bachelor for an unusually long period of time; he was given the laqab (i.e. epithet) of ÿπÿØŸà ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿ£ÿ© ('Aduww al Mar'a), meaning \\"Enemy of woman.\\" However, he eventually married and had two children, a son and a daughter. His wife died in 1977; his son died in 1978 in a car accident.
