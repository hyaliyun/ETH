Spadafora was a noted evangelist and attracted countless to the Dominican fold while also converting the hearts of others who led dissolute lives. He is best known for being the first superior of a church he oversaw construction of in Monte Cerignone after receiving the papal approval of Pope Alexander VI to commence such work. Spadaforo received beatification from Pope Benedict XV in 1921 after the pontiff confirmed the late priest's 'cultus' (or popular and widespread devotion) as being enduring. Life Domenico Spadafora was born in 1450 in Randazzo to nobles that came from Constantinople. He was born as the third of five children to the Baron of Maletto Giovanni Spadafora and his lower-class wife Marina. His elder brother was Giovanni while he had two sisters - one being Bartolomea - and another brother named Pietro. He studied in Perugia after moving there in 1477 and was later sent to Padua where he earned his bachelor's degree on 23 June 1479. In Venice on 7 June 1487 he was granted his master's degree in theological studies after a public dissertation alongside eleven other candidates. He joined the Order of Preachers at the convent of Santa Zita in Palermo after returning following the dissertation when his superiors recalled him. Spadaforo was ordained to the priesthood in 1479. He participated at the General Chapter of the order in Venice in 1487. He was supposed to be assigned to a convent in Messina in 1487 but the Father General of the order Gioacchino Torriani decided to have him as his collaborator in Rome; in 1487 he participated in the General Chapter in Le Mans in the Kingdom of France. Spadaforo became a noted preacher and evangelist and won the hearts of converts that had led dissolute lives - such an example of holiness also prompted countless others to join the Dominican fold as religious themselves. He was known for his intense devotion to the passion of Jesus Christ. He taught theological studies in the Sicilian area. He founded the convent of Madonna delle Grazie - that housed a miraculous image of the Madonna - in 1491 in Monte Cerignone and served for the remainder of his life as its first superior. This came about when the faithful of the area wanted to enhance the small chapel and thus the Master General of the Dominicans sent for Spadaforo to oversee its renovation. The priest arrived there in the town on 15 September 1491 and set off on foot to Rome in 1492 to receive papal approval for this work. At this point Pope Innocent VII died and Pope Alexander VI was elected in a chain of events that postponed their meeting until 22 February 1493 when papal permission was granted; he returned with the decree of approval in 1493. Construction of the church commenced in 1494 and the work concluded in 1491. The Bishop Marco Vigerio della Rovere consecrated the new church on 16 July 1498. Domenico Spadaforo died in his cell on 21 December 1521 after his health deteriorated during the previous few months. He died after the celebration of Mass and asking the forgiveness of his brother Dominicans for his mistakes; the ailing priest also received the last sacraments and died at sunset as his fellow brothers sang the \\"Salve Regina\\". =Exhumation= The priest's remains were exhumed in 1545 and were deemed to be incorrupt and moved once again in 1653 after the convent he was interred in was suppressed - the remains were instead taken to the Santa Maria in Recluso church. His remains were relocated on 3 October 1677. The remains were relocated once more on 4 April 2005 to the Chiesa della Santissima Trinit√†. Beatification The beatification process was initiated in April 1920 and on 12 January 1921 the members of the Congregation of Rites voted in favor of approving the local 'cultus' (or popular devotion) of the late priest without the need for following the normal canonical process. His beatification was confirmed on 14 January 1921 after Pope Benedict XV granted formal approval to the recognition of the 'cultus'. The process for subsequent sanctification was revitalized decades later when the diocesan process of canonization opened on 10 September 2006 in the Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro when the Bishop Luigi Negri inaugurated the process. The diocesan process concluded on 14 September 2008 and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 17 July 2009. The current postulator assigned to the cause - since 2006 - is Father Cristoforo M. Bialowas.

History The party was formed through the merger of the Sudan Liberal Party, the Sudanese Democratic Movement, the Movement of New Democratic Forces (HAQ) and the United Leadership and the Sudanese Democratic Party on 4 September 2008. It operated under the name United Democratic Liberal Party, till the first convention of the party in September 2010, where its name has changed to Liberal Democratic Party. On 1 August 2016 the party changed its name to the Liberal Party of Sudan. The first convention of the LP, held on 17‚Äì18 September 2010, elected Nour Tawir Kafi Abu Ras, as the leader of the party and president of the executive committee. It also elected members of the LDP Political Council, who, in turn, elected Adil Abdel Aati as chairman of the PC. In July 2011 Nour Tawir resigned from the party leadership. The political council of the party elected Mayada Swar Aldahab as its new leader. She was re-elected in the Extraordinary Convention of the party on 2 February 2013. In May‚ÄìJune 2014 the LDP has faced serious internal conflict between the political council and the party president. The Conflict ended with the majority of LDP members and leaders organising a general congress on 24 December 2014 and electing a new acting leadership with Nour Tawir Kafi Abu Ras as honorary president and Adil Abdel Aati as acting president. Mayada Swar Aldahab has defected the LDP to form a new party with a defected group of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) under the name of the Liberal Democratic Unionist Party (LDUP). In 9 January 2016 the Execuctive Committee of the party elected Dr. Ibrahim Nageeb as Acting President. List of party leaders * Nour Tawir Kafi Abu Ras ( December 2006 ‚Äì June 2011) * Mayada Swar Aldahab (June 2011 ‚Äì June 2014) * Adil Abdel Aati (December 2014 ‚Äì January 2016) * Ibrahim Nageeb (January 2016 ‚Äì present) Ideology The party's ideology is social liberalism. LP was the first and the only political party in Sudan calling openly for a social market economy. Its predecessor, the SLP published one of the most advanced economic programs in this field, calling for the creation of social market projects in the border areas of Darfur and Eastern Sudan and programs of rebuilding the war-devastated areas based on Social market principles. Activities Members of the party from southern Sudan formed their own regional organisation in October 2010, South Sudan Liberal Party, which later changed its name to South Sudan Liberal Youth Forum. The LP is one of the most active forces in Sudan struggling against Omar al-Bashir's regime, defending human rights and women's rights, calling for justice and comprehensive peace in Southern, Eastern and Western Sudan (Darfur). It was active in the 30 January 2011 Youth uprising in Khartoum and major cities, where five members of its political council were detained for more than a month. Some LP members established the Human Rights Advocacy Network for Democracy (HAND), a network monitoring human and basic rights violations in Sudan. HAND is active in campaigns to release political prisoners and detainees and is active against civil war crimes in Sudan and against human rights violations within war zones. LP members are also active in many organisations and foundations working inside Sudan, like the Ali Abdel Latif Centre for Culture and Developmental Studies in Khartoum, the Free Thought Centre in Madani Town in Central region, and the Abiye Organisation for Peace and Development in Southern Kordfan. Structure LP has branches and units in ten Sudanese states (out of 16 states). It is relatively strong in West Kurdufan, North Darfur, River Nile State, Al Jazirah State. However, much of the LP membership is concentrated in the Khartoum region, which is the home to one fourth of the country's population. More than 40% of the LP members are women, which gives it the highest rate of female membership of all of Sudan's political parties, and 74% of members are younger than 35 years old. Affiliations The party is a member of the Africa Liberal Network , and it was a member of the Alliance of Democrats until its dissolution in 2012.

The Samoothiri had a ten thousand strong Nair bodyguard called the Kozhikkottu pathinaayiram (The 10,000 of Kozhikode) who defended the capital and supported the administration within the city. He had a larger force of 30,000 Nairs in his capacity as the Prince of Eranadu, called the Kozhikkottu Muppatinaayiram (The 30,000 of Kozhikode). The Nairs also formed the members of the suicide squad (chaver). The aristocratic Nairs had their Taravad houses in and around the capital. Several Nairs in the city were traders too. The Nairs could not be imprisoned or fettered except for serious crimes like cow slaughter, criticising the King etc.Narayanan, M.G.S., Calicut: The City of Truth (2006) Calicut University Publications The Mappila community of Kozhikode acted as an important support base for the city's military, economic and political affairs. They were settled primarily in Kuttichira and Idiyangara. Their aristocratic dwelling houses were similar to the tharavad houses of the Nairs and the Thiyyas. Two Ghazi's were recognised as their spiritual leaders. Travellers like Barbosa were intrigued by the extent to which the Mapillas blended into the local society, who spoke the same language and looked like any other Nair (except for the round caps and long beards). Thiyya Community The Thiyyas formed the vaidyars(Physicians), local militia and traders of Kozhikode. Several aristocratic thiyya families such as 'Kallingal madom' were settled in and around the city. Tamil Brahmins The Tamil Brahmins are primarily settled around the Tali Siva temple. They arrived in Kozhikode as dependants of chieftains, working as cooks, cloth merchants and moneylenders.Narayanan.M.G.S.,Calicut: The City of Truth(2006) Calicut University Publications They have retained their Tamil language and dialects as well as caste rituals. The Gujarati community is settled mostly around the Jain temple in and around the Valliyangadi. They owned a large number of establishments, especially textile and sweet meat shops. They must have arrived in Kozhikode at least from the beginning of the 14th century. They belong to either the Hindu or the Jain community. A few Marwari families are also found in Kozhikode who were basically moneylenders.

It was built between 1959 and 1960, according to plans produced by the architects and Alois Machatschek. It comprises 47 residential apartments. Historical context In the late 1950s, after seven Nazi years followed by a decade of Soviet occupation, Vienna suffered from an acute housing shortage. The answer was a municipal building programme that would set the pattern for subsequent decades. Using \\"Plattenbau\\" construction, it became possible to construct residential apartment complexes taller and wider than ever before, mainly based on large simple block shaped structures. New regulations meant that new apartments all now came with a built-in bathroom and toilet, while the minimum floor space required was increased from 42 to 55 square meters. Constructed between 1959 and 1960, the Arthur-Schnitzler-Hof was an early example, in Austria, of the new approach. History of the site The Arthur-Schnitzler- Hof was built on what had been the south-eastern corner of the W√§hringer Jewish cemetery. In 1942 the remaining Jewish community in Vienna was dispossessed and the entire cemetery passed into the control of the city authorities. On its D√∂blinger High Street side between 1,500 and 2,000 graves were destroyed as part of a project to construct a (never completed) fire service reservoir. The community attempted to gather the physical remains and rebury them in a large mass grave in the city's main cemetery on the south side of Vienna. Assurances were provided by the city authorities that the destroyed portion of the old W√§hringer cemetery would never be built on, but on 28 March 1958 the site was nevertheless redesignated to make it available for building construction. Construction The first three residential tower blocks in D√∂bling were constructed in 1958 and 1959 at the Helmut-Qualtinger- Hof development, using plans drawn up by Hermann Kutschera. Taking their inspiration from this, Michel Engelhart and Alois Machatschek planned a significantly taller, 13 floor, building on the gently sloping site for the Arthur Schnitzler-Hof. The structure comprises two blocks, set on slightly different levels, linked by a shared encased stairwell. The architects varied the levels of the buildings by half a floor, and specified a simple exterior colour scheme using wide columns of yellow and grey. The northern and southern sides featured small concrete balconies, while the casing for the stairwell is slightly inset from the rest of the facade. To the left of the entrance is the little \\"Horseman\\" (\\"Reiter\\") fountain, designed by Franz Fischer. The name The development takes its name from the distinguished physician-dramatist- author Arthur Schnitzler (1862-1931). Renovation A renovation programme undertaken in 2004/2005 involved replacing the doors and windows and major roof repairs. The application of modern exterior wall insulation permanently reduced heating costs and carbon emission costs.

Quezon Institute is the biggest unit of PTSI. PTSI was incorporated on February 29, 1960 and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 1960. History During the American colonial era, tuberculosis was a major health concern in the Philippines. In 1910, a regional meeting was held in Manila and it was reported the mortality of the disease is estimated to be 40,000. The health situation led to the establishment of the Philippine Islands Anti-Tuberculosis Society on July 29, 1910. It was approved in August of the same year. Eleanor Franklin Egan and Sixto de los Angeles led the organization's efforts against tuberculosis. Egan served as the group's first president. 1962 Philippine stamp showing the frontage of the hospital and a portrait of Manuel L. Quezon The health facility of the Philippine Islands Anti-Tuberculosis Society first opened to the public as the Santol Sanatorium in 1918. In 1934, then-Senate President Manuel L. Quezon lobbied for the passage of the Sweepstakes Law which allocated 25 percent of its proceeds to the Philippine Tuberculosis Society. This led to the establishment of the hospital arm of the organization in 1938. The health facility formerly known as the Santol Sanatorium was renamed Quezon Institute, in honor of President Manuel L. Quezon who attended the inauguration of the hospital. The complex was designed in the Art Deco architectural style by Juan Nakpil. Quezon Institute was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army during the World War II. The hospital's staff were ordered to be relocated to the San Juan De Dios Hospital in Intramuros, Manila. The hospital's equipment, records, and furniture were looted.

The Quezon Institute was plot setting for the episode 'Braso' of the 2010 horror film Cinco. In 2014 was plot setting for the episode 'Taktak' of the film My Big Bossing. In 2019 was plot setting in the horror film Maledicto and Clarita. E. Rodriguez Sr. Avenue site A portion of the hospital's property at E. Rodriguez Sr. Avenue in Quezon City was sold to Puregold. The property also served as the main headquarters of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) until 2010, when it transferred to the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay. As early as 2011, Ayala Land became interested in acquiring the property occupied by the Quezon Institute and is planning to convert the property to a mixed used development. Ayala Land expressed its intent in preserving the historic buildings of the complex which then recently became automatically protected under the National Cultural Heritage Act, similar to what it has done with Nielson Tower in Makati.

Set in Paris, France, the book follows a Sotheby's auctioneer who discovers a wide range of antiques and collectibles in an apartment that had been locked for 70 years. It was first published by Thomas Dunne Books for St. Martin's Press in 2014 and eventually appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2016 and is a USA Today bestseller. Background Gable began writing the novel in 2010 after her agent told her about a real-life apartment in Paris that had been locked up for 70 years. Although based on actual events, the story about the Sotheby's employee's involvement with the apartment is fictionalized. Prior to writing the novel, Gable spent four months researching the apartment, the time period, and the apartment's former owner, Marthe de Florian. Summary The main plot of the novel revolves around April Vogt, a Sotheby's auctioneer who is tasked with assessing and selling rare antiques and collectibles found in an apartment in Paris that had been locked and unoccupied for the previous 70 years. The apartment is only opened after an heir to Marthe de Florian, the former owner, passes away. The narrative alternates between modern day and the late 19th- and early 20th-centuries. The past storyline revolves around Marthe's diary entries while the present storyline follows April's quest to find the history behind the apartment's accoutrements. One particular item of interest for April is a portrait of Marthe painted by Giovanni Boldini. As a result of her research, April becomes increasingly fascinated with Marthe, Boldini, and the contents of the apartment. She also reevaluates her position in a disappointing marriage and considers staying in Paris with a potential love interest. Historical figures Throughot the novel, Vogt reads pages from de Florian's diaries that reference her life during the Belle √âpoque, including her friendships, rivalries, and romances with various historical figures including Jeanne Hugo, L√©on Daudet, Jean-Baptiste Charcot, Robert de Montesquiou, and Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria. Reception The book received generally favorable reviews. The blog, MomAdvice.com, called it a \\"fun summer historical fiction escape to Paris.\\" The Historical Novel Society noted that it was a \\"charming read about a fascinating history and the woman behind it.\\" The Library Journal called it a \\"stunning and fascinating debut [that] will capture the interest of a wide audience.\\" The book became a New York Times bestseller in January 2016 and is a USA Today bestseller.

The monument, a pyramidal stone structure built in 1827, is one of only three such structures ever built in the state, and is now topped by a beacon light. It is owned and managed by the United States Coast Guard, and is an active aid to navigation. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history Little Mark Island is an island about in size, and is located in northern Casco Bay, south of Haskell Island and west of the southern tip of Bailey Island. The island is roughly lozenge-shaped, and is devoid of trees. Its high point, near the center, rises to about above mean sea level, and is where the monument is located. The monument is a stone structure in the shape of a slender square pyramid, with a total height of and walls that are long at the base and at the top. It appears to have been built from rock quarried on the island. The monument is marked with vertical black stripes on each face. A steel ladder is mounted on the south side, and the west side has an open entrance into the structure's interior. The interior consists of an open chamber which rises to the top of the monument, and was probably originally open at the top, intended to act as a chimney flue. The top has since been closed off by a concrete cap. The only fixtures in the interior are a box housing equipment for operating the marine beacon mounted on top of the concrete cap. The beacon is powered by batteries, which are recharged by solar panels mounted on a concrete pad just outside the monument.Koski-Karell, Daniel (2016). NRHP nomination for Little Mark Island Monument; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The monument was built in 1827, and was a functional replica of a similar structure built in 1811 at Cape Elizabeth, a location now occupied by the Cape Elizabeth Lights. A similar monument was built on Stage Island in 1823 off Biddeford, which also serves today as an aid to navigation. When built, the interior would have been stocked with supplies usable by shipwreck victims who might seek refuge on the island. The light was installed on the tower in 1927.

It is used to reduce or eliminate symptoms such as anxiety, depression, guilt, anger, and post-traumatic reactions. It can also be used to enhance psychological resources such as confidence and self-esteem. The procedure involves having the client visualize a series of progressively longer \\"movies\\" of the trauma memory while the therapist counts out loud (first to a count of 10, then 20, then 30, etc.). By repeatedly imagining the movie of the memory, the memory gets \\"digested\\" or healed, via desensitization, emotional processing, gaining perspective, or other means.  Approach  Prior to the session, the therapist actively guides the client in identifying the beginning moment of the chosen movie (before the trauma event happened) and the ending moment (a point after the trauma event which provided relief). The client is asked to watch, in imagination, a movie of the trauma memory from beginning to end, while the therapist counts aloud from one to 10; then the next time to 20; then to 30, and so on, to a maximum of 100. Later when the memory is nearly resolved and there is less work to do, the length of the counting for the movies is progressively decreased. The client can choose to discuss the memory but is not required to; thus the client can maintain privacy regarding memory details. The therapist then asks the client to rate their level of distress on a scale of 0-10 (according to the Subjective units of distress scale or SUDS). The therapist's goal is to bring the SUDS rating of the traumatic memory to a score of 0 (no distress), and can adjust the exposure level as needed by increasing or decreasing the numbers counted during their movie.  Modifications to counting method  PC is a modified version of the counting method (CM), but with the following modifications: # Multiple dual- focus exposures (visualizing the movie during therapist counting) within a single session. # Starting with a movie-duration count of 10 and increasing by a count of 10 each time (to 20, then 30, etc.) up to the maximum count of 100. This is to further control the dose and allow for progressively greater exposure as the client makes progress on mastering the memory. Later, when the client has nearly completed trauma processing, the count becomes progressively shorter as there is less work to do. # Minimizing the review phase, so that the client is only asked to briefly comment on the experience, but not to recount the details of the movie (unless the client takes the initiative to do so). # The imaginal exposure movie goes all the way to the full-relief ending, even if that requires going far beyond the immediate conclusion of the most traumatic part of the memory (in CM the movie ends shortly after the most traumatic component is over). # Continuing until Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) is zero and there is no further change (in CM the work can stop when SUDS is two or lower). Versus EMDR Two studies have been completed comparing PC to EMDR. A pilot study compared EMDR and PC for volunteers from the community who reported having a disturbing memory; some met criteria for PTSD and some did not. Ten experienced EMDR-trained therapists were briefly trained in PC, and participants were randomized to treatment condition. No significant differences between EMDR and PC were found. The treatments were rated by participants as equally difficult. EMDR had a trend of fewer dropouts whereas PC had a trend of greater efficiency. In the other comparison study, 109 therapists in either EMDR or PC training programs worked on several of their own upsetting memories in practicums during the course of the training. For each treated memory they recorded treatment time as well as pre/post memory-related distress ratings; ratings were repeated at 2 and 10 weeks post- treatment via e-mail. Participants also rated the perceived difficulty of the treatment they experienced. Participants in both conditions reported significant reductions in memory-related distress, which persisted at 2 weeks and 10 weeks post-treatment. There were no differences in effect size or maintenance of gains. PC was 37.5% more efficient than EMDR, and was rated by those in the client role as being less difficult.

It has a bright yellow beard, slightly tipped in purple. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, due to its environmental conditions of its natural habitat. Description It is a geophyte, with small, compact rhizomes.British Iris Society (1997) The rhizomes are close to the surface level, so that they receive maximum solar energy. It has up to 8 (in number), greenish grey, linear or lanceolate (shaped) leaves. That can grow up to long, and nearly 1 cm wide. They start to grow in spring and fade before the end of summer. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The stems hold 1 or 2, terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming in March,Basak Gardner & Chris Gardner or between April and May (in Europe). The silk-like, or satin-like, flowers with brown-black, brown-purple, or brown, multiple spots, streaks or veining, over a yellowish or brownish, greenish ground. The flowers can appear to be a deep copper colour when backlit. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are reflexed (folded backwards) and, long and between 3 and 4.5 cm wide. They have a deep maroon, semi-circular shaped signal patch, which is about 2 cm wide. In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are bright yellow, and slightly purple tipped. The standards are a slightly paler colour than the falls, they are generally long and between 5 and 7 cm wide. Although variable colour forms are found. It has style branches that are keeled, with wide spots on a yellow ground. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which have not yet been described. =Biochemistry= A study was carried out in 2013, to find out what oils are contained in the rhizomes of various irises in Syria, including Iris germanica, Iris barnumiae, I. bostrensis and in Iris auranitica. It found myristic acid, lauric acid, decanoic acid (capric acid), palmitic acid and methyl ester. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count of 2n=20. Taxonomy It is known in Hebrew, it is written as ◊ê◊ô◊®◊ô◊° ◊ë◊ï◊¶◊ô◊®◊î. It is sometimes mistakenly spelled Iris bostensis. The Latin specific epithet bostrensis refers to the ancient city of Bosra in Syria, due to being found close to the ancient site. It was first published and described by Paul Mouterde in the Bull. Soc. Bot. France Vol.101 on page 420 in 1955. It was thought that I. bostrensis was a taller form, or a different coloured variety of Iris atropurpurea. In 1933, John Edward Dinsmore published Iris atropurpurea var. purpurea Dinsm. in Fl. Syria edition 2, Vol.2 on page 600. It was later classified as a synonym of I. bostrensis. It is thought that similar shaded forms of I bostrensis can be found within natural populations of Iris nigricans. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then changed on 2 December 2004. I. bostrensis is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia, within the Middle east. =Range= It is found in southern Syria,Kerry Scott Walter, Harriet J. Gillett, World Conservation Monitoring Centre (from Busra (or Bosra), to Jabal al-Arab), in northern Jordan, (between Ramtha and Mafraq,) and occasionally in Israel. =Habitat= It grows in dry, rocky, open scrub-land or agricultural fields, (including cornfields,), on soils containing basalt. Conservation In 1997, it was assessed and classed as rare within Syria, due to habitat destruction. On 5 February 2016, it was re- assessed and classed as Endangered due to the threats of agricultural development, overgrazing by cattle/livestock of local and nomadic communities. It may also be threatened by the effects of the Syria civil war. It is grown for conservation within the Royal Botanical Garden of Jordan. Cultivation It is considered as a fragile, or delicate plant, it needs to be protected from direct rain or garden watering regimens. References Sources * Mathew, B.

After keyword research, search engine professionals cluster keywords into small groups which they spread across pages of the website to achieve higher rankings in the search engine results (SERP). Keyword clustering is a fully automated process performed by keyword clustering tools. The term and the first principles were first introduced in 2015 by the Russian search engine optimization expert Alexey Chekushin. The SERP-based keyword clustering tool Just-Magic was released in the same year in Russia. The keyword clustering tool available in English language was developed by the Thailand-based company Topvisor in the summer of 2015.. A year later such tool was introduced by Estonia-based company Spyserp. The main difference is all languages are available for clustering there.  Method  Keyword clustering is based on the first ten search results (TOP-10) regardless of the search engine or custom settings. The TOP 10 search results are the first ten listings that a search engine shows for a certain search query. In most cases, the TOP-10 matches the first page of the search results. The general algorithm of keyword clustering includes four steps that a tool completes to cluster keywords: # The tool takes keywords one by one from the list and sends them as search queries to the search engine. It scans the search results, pulls the ten first search listings, and matches them to each keyword from the list. # If a search engine returns the same search listings for two different keywords and the number of this listings is enough to trigger clustering, two keywords will be grouped together (clustered). # A minimum number of matches in the search results that trigger keyword clustering is called the clustering level. The clustering level is customizable, and most tools allow changing it in the settings prior to the keyword clustering. The clustering level affects the number of groups and keywords in the group after clustering. The higher clustering level produces more groups with fewer keywords in every group. This happens due to a minimum chance to have 9-10 matching documents on the search results page (it would include almost all pages in the TOP-10 of search results). On the opposite, the clustering level 1 or 2 will create a few groups with a lot of keywords in each of them. There are certain exceptions, but they are not common. # If a tool finds no matching URLs in the TOP-10 of the search results, these keywords are sent into a separate group. Apart from the clustering level, there are also different types of the keyword clustering that affect the way all keywords within one group are linked to each other. Similar to the clustering level, the type of keyword clustering can be set prior to the clustering.  Types  = Soft = A keyword clustering tool scans the list of keywords and then picks the most popular keyword. The most popular keyword is a keyword with the highest search volume. Then a tool compares the TOP 10 search result listings that showed up for the taken keyword to the TOP10 search results that showed up for another keyword to detect the number of matching URLs. If the detected number matches the selected grouping level, the keywords are grouped together. As the result, all keywords within one group will be related to the keyword with the highest search volume, but they will not necessarily be related to each other (will not necessarily have matching URLs with each other). = Moderate = A keyword clustering tool scans the list of keywords and then picks a keyword with the highest search volume. Then a tool compares the TOP 10 search result listings that showed up for the taken keyword to the TOP10 search results that showed up for another keyword to detect the number of matching URLs. At the same time, a tool compares all keywords to each other. If the detected number of identical search listings matches the selected grouping level, the keywords are grouped together. As the result, every keyword within one group will have a related keyword with matching URL or URLs in the same group. But two random pairs of keywords will not necessarily have matching URLs. = Hard = A keyword clustering tool scans the list of keywords and then picks a keyword with the highest search volume. Then a tool compares the TOP 10 search result listings that showed up for the taken keyword to the TOP10 search results that showed up for another keyword to detect the number of matching URLs. At the same time, a tool compares all keywords to each other and all matching URLs in the detected pairs. If the detected number of identical search listings matches the selected grouping level, the keywords are grouped together. As the result, all keywords within a group will be related to each other by having the same matching URLs.  History  As the major part of the website optimization process, SEO professionals research keywords to get a pool of target search terms which they use to promote their website and get higher rankings in the search results. After they get a list of keywords related to the contents of the website, they segment the list into smaller groups. Each group is usually relevant to a certain page of the website or a certain topic. Originally, SEO professionals had to group out the keyword pool manually, by picking a keyword after keyword and identifying possible clusters. It could be done with the help of Google Adwords Keyword Tool but it still required a lot of manual work. There was a need in an automated algorithm that would segment keywords into clusters on auto-pilot. = Lemma-based keyword grouping = Prior to the keyword clustering, search engine optimization experts developed keyword grouping tools based on the process known as lemmatisation. Lemma is a base or dictionary form of a word (without inflectional endings). In linguistics, lemmatisation is a process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. In search engine optimization, the process of lemmatisation includes four steps: # Keywords are picked from the list one-by-one; # Keywords are broken down into lemmas; # Keywords with the same lemmas are detected; # Keywords with matching lemmas are grouped together. As the result, a search engine optimization specialist gets a list of keyword groups. Each keyword in a certain group has matching lemmas with all other keywords within this group. = SERP-based = Compared to lemma-based keyword grouping, SERP-based keyword clustering produces groups of keywords that might reveal no morphological matches, but will have matches in the search results. It allows search engine professionals getting a keyword structure close to what a search engine dictates. Soft and Hard type of keyword clustering and the general algorithm was introduced by the Russian SEO expert Alexey Chekushin in 2015. In the same year, he developed and introduced the automated tool that could cluster keywords.

The state park was considered one of the seven highest priorities for conservation of the reefs. The Parcel de Manuel Lu√≠s Marine State Park was created by decree 11.902 of 11 June 1991 with the purpose of protecting the largest coral reef of South America from the environmental impacts of hydrocarbon pollution and over fishing. The state park was to protect the marine fauna and flora and natural scenic beauty, under the administration of SEMATUR. It was to be used for scientific, educational and recreational uses that would avoid changes or environmental impact. The state park became a Ramsar Site in February 2000. Environment The reef is an area of great biodiversity, holding all the coral reef species found on the northeast coast. Coral species include Agaricia agaricites, Agaricia fragilis, Meandrina braziliensis, Great star coral Montastraea cavernosa, Mussismilia hispida, Porites astreoides, Scolymia wellsi, Siderastrea stellata and Millepora alcicornis. The corals are home to multi-coloured fish such as parrotfish, sergeant major and butterflyfish, and to larger species such as groupers and sea turtles. Coral bleaching has been reported since 1999.

It was the European invasion that brought significant change as they enforced the trade with their military. Arrival of the Europeans The first European power to enter the region was Portugal in 1498. The relationship between Vasco da Gama and Samuthiri deteriorated and Vasco entered into spice (pepper) trade with Kolathiri. Francisco de Almeida the first Portuguese Viceroy to India, established military barracks in Cannanore (~30 km north of Thalassery) in 1505. The Netherlands followed the Portuguese after the Dutch army defeated the Portuguese in Cochin in 1663. The French East India Company established military units in Thalassery in 1721 and later moved to Mah√© (~5 km south of Thalassery).

Anglo-Mysore Wars  Thalassery Jagannath Temple, Kerala In 1764, Hyder Ali sent an emissary, Ananta Rao, to Tellicherry to make a neutrality pact with the British. In 1766, Hyder Ali and his forces were welcomed to North Malabar by the Ali Raja of Arakkal kingdom in Cannanore. The Mysorean army, guided by Ali Raja and his brother, seized the palace of the Raja of Kolathiri in Chirakkal, causing the raja and his family to seek refuge in the English trading station at Tellichery. Hyder installed friendly chieftains as governors. The prince regent of Kolathunad became his administrator and forced Kurungot Nair and Kottayam Raja of Thalassery to pledge allegiance to Mysore. The Seven Years' War between British and French had repercussions for the area. The prince regent attacked Thalassery on Hyder's order to protect the French forces in Mah√© from the British. British forces in Tellicherry attacked Mah√© and forced the French to evacuate in 1779. This prompted the Zamorin and Kottayam Raja to ally with the British and they recaptured most of the territories that had been lost to Hyder.

By the 1774 Treaty of Mangalore concluding the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the English gave up their claims and declared the kingdoms in Kerala to be allies of Mysore. The British exploited Hyder's death and Tipu's 1781 retirement to Mysore for his coronation. Tipu returned in 1789 and captured south Malabar but he was not able to win Thalassery and North Malabar due to the English presence.  The spice trade  The British established a trading post and built a factory at Tellicherry in 1694, having gained permission from Vadakkalankur, the prince regent of the Raja of Kolatunad. They had already been trading on the Malabar coast for much of that century, buying pepper from Moplah merchants, and had established a similar post at Travancore ten years earlier.

One of the main traditional custom during the vishu festival is the submitting Pal(milk) to the theyyam at early morning by Mullikodan Taravadu. Sree Muchilot Bhagavathi Ramanthali Muchilot Bhagavathi is the chief goddess of Vaniya community. An exploration into the history of the goddess, Sree Muchilot Bhagavathi, the source of all prosperity, the reservoir of all knowledge and an immeasurable ocean of benevolence, reveals the fact that there are various opinions related to her life. Some of her devotees believe her to be the goddess bloomed from the sweat of Lord Shiva shed at the time of his stupendous dance on the Mount Kailasa. Whereas some others believe her to be a deity incarnated on the earth with a \\"prasadam\\" to purgate the world of all kinds of incurable diseases, or a goddess sent to earth in the form of flame to annihilate all the evils on the earth. But some scholars are of the unanimous opinion that she was a Brahmin virgin born in \\"Rayaramangalath Mana\\" in the village of Peringellur, near Taliparamba. Those were the days after the betrothal of the virgin renowned for her unfathomable Vedic knowledge. It so happened that \\"Peringellur Mootha Gurukkal\\" (a Brahmin) and his disciples challenged the \\"Naduvazhi\\", on the request of the \\"Naduvazhi\\" the Brahmin virgin took part in the \\"Naduvazhi\\". The mesmerizing arguments and counter arguments darted by the virgin against \\"Mootha Gurukal\\" and his disciples stunned them and so they were envious of her. Being very shrewd and deceptive, they meditated to trap her somehow. So they asked her two questions: \\"Which is the most excruciating pain?\\" \\"What is the most ecstatial state?\\" \\"Labour pain\\" and \\"erotic state\\", she answered innocently. They distorted her answers stating that woman having no such mundane experiences could never answer those questions and so she was not virgin. The issue ended up in her excommunication. The innocent and fragile virgin being struck by the arrows of deception from the Brahmins took asylum at the scared feet of \\"Payyanur Perumal\\", \\"Karivellurappan\\" and \\"Rayaramangalath Bhagavathi\\", with a heart full of woes. She adored them and offered all the despairs and throes of her heart before their divine presence and resolved to immolate herself. As she was preparing her pyre, a \\"Muchilot Karnavar\\" happened to reach there. On her request, he poured oil from a pot into the fire with much reluctance. Thus she immolated herself and her soul departed to Lord Shiva. With a fraternal love, Lord Shiva sent her back to the earth with some boons, a golden fan, jewelry and various weapons to redeem the world. The Karnavar having seen the immolation of the virgin was full of grief and kept \\"Thuthika\\"(the empty pot) in the \\"Padinjattakam\\"(Pooja room), Karnavar's wife had an apparition vision of Sree Muchilot Bhagavathi, as she was drawing water from the well. Meanwhile, \\"Thuthika\\"(the empty pot) kept in the \\"Padinjattakam\\"(Pooja room) started tossing in the air. In an astrological speculation the Karnavar had an apocalypse that the soul of the virgin had been sent back by Lord Shiva to abide in him. The goddess whom the Karnavar places in a silver tabernacle in the \\"Padinjattakam\\", to worship began to be known as Sree Muchilot Bhagavathi.https://sites.google.com/site/narathsreemuchilottubhagavathi/muchilottu- bhagavathi  Sree Muchilot Kavu , Korom Korom a village in Payyanur entered into the tourism map of Kerala as a result of the proposed Perumkaliyattam - one of the popular theyyam forms- at Sree Muchilot Kavu in 2009.

It was set up in 2014 up by alumni of Test Match Sofa, an earlier alternative commentary site. Broadcasts have emanated from a variety of sites in London, where the commentators describe the television coverage to listeners, while engaging in wide ranging discussion of the cricket and anything else taking their fancy. Ireland vs Pakistan Guerilla Cricket successfully bid for the exclusive radio rights to Ireland's inaugural Test match against Pakistan, beating both the BBC and talkSPORT to be the official radio partners of Cricket Ireland. The game was held at Malahide, near Dublin, from May 11‚Äì15, 2018. It was the first time the team commentated live from the match itself. Coverage While initially focused on England's international cricket matches, the service has developed over a number of years to cover major series involving India, Pakistan, Australia and South Africa, as well as World Cup and IPL T20 cricket. Perhaps the most unusual coverage was of the Under 19 World Cup game between England and Namibia. Sense of humour Guerilla Cricket is known for its sense of humour, irreverence and surrealism, in sharp contrast to the formal nature of official broadcasts such as Test Match Special. Its method of operation puts it beyond the reach of the game's controlling body in England, the England and Wales Cricket Board, and it is unlikely that any current test players would be allowed to appear. The site has benefited from social media in its commentary, unlike traditional, one-way, broadcasting, which allows an exchange of information. A fan of the site has been seen wearing a gorilla costume at matches. UK General Elections As well as providing cricket commentary, Guerilla Cricket also provided on-air coverage of the UK General Elections in 2015 and 2017, providing their usual irreverent views as events unfolded. Key events were marked with musical jingles provided by James Sherwood who has provided a number of songs which are used within the cricket commentary, including the Guerilla Cricket theme tune. Fundraising appeals A number of appeals have enabled Guerilla Cricket to remain on-air and broadcast worldwide free commentary. In July 2015, the site ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise ¬£3,000 to broadcast the 2015 Ashes series live from the Jetlag Bar in London. A subsequent campaign the following winter raised over ¬£5,000 to broadcast test series in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa. More recently, a campaign has raised nearly ¬£3,000 to enable the team to cover Ireland's inaugural Test match.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The town of Brookfield was chartered in 1781, and developed along Ridge Road, which was in the 19th century a major north-south stagecoach route, connecting Montpelier and Randolph. The town arose on the eastern shore of Sunset Pond (originally known as Colt's Pond), which was in 1812 spanned by the first incarnation of the Sunset Lake Floating Bridge, the only known pontoon bridge in the eastern United States. The village center has lost little of its 19th-century charm, retaining unpaved main roads and tall shade trees. with The historic district covers , extending along the east side of Sunset Lake as far south as the First Congregational Church, and more than half a mile north of the floating bridge. It extends westward across the lake and all the way to the Interstate 89 right of way, thus including a portion of the village's rural views. The developed area of the district extends along Ridge Road and Shore Road, with mostly modestly scaled residences that have vernacular Greek Revival styling. Prominent public buildings include the church (built 1843) and the former town hall, a three-story mid-19th century building that has housed a variety of municipal functions and community organizations throughout its history. Near the southern end of the village are remnants of a modest 19th-century industrial enterprise, a fork factory powered by the waters of Sunset Brook, which exits the lake near its southern end.

The property is owned by Eldorado Resorts Corporation, and consists of eight buildings, ranging between 12 and 20 floors, with a total of 2,256 units. History Construction began in 2003, with Penta Building Group as general contractor and Berkley Group, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as the developer. Grandview was designed by Allen + Philp Architects, based in Scottsdale, Arizona. The project would initially consist of two towers, both 12 stories in height, with a total of 384 units. There were tentative plans to add eight additional towers over the next 10 years, for a total of 1,600 units. As of April 2004, the project's first tower, as well as a sales building and property amenities, were scheduled for completion in March 2005, with the second tower expected to be completed four months later. A total of 300 construction workers were expected to work on the project, which would require 1,563 truckloads of concrete. In November 2004, Penta began construction on a third tower, 12 stories high with 120 units. Construction was expected to last a year, and was estimated at $21 million. In May 2005, Grandview's owner, the Fort Lauderdale-based Eldorado Resorts Corporation, announced that the property planned to build 10 timeshare towers over the next several years, with approximately one tower being constructed each year. The property would ultimately feature over 2,000 units, and was expected to become the largest timeshare complex in the United States. By that point, the project's first two towers, with 196 units each, had been completed and sold out, while a majority of the third tower's planned 240 units had also sold. A 400-unit tower opened in May 2009. In 2010, the adjacent South Point Hotel Casino and Spa opened the Grandview Lounge, named after the timeshare property. By December 2010, Grandview featured 1,400 units, with 400 planned to open the following month. Foundation work for a new 20-story tower ‚Äì the first one to be built since 2009 ‚Äì was scheduled to begin on April 25, 2012. Berkley Group planned for a total of 10 towers on the 27-acre property, with more than 1,500 units completed up to that point. The new tower was under construction as of September 2013, and was expected for completion in early 2014. The new tower would increase Grandview's units from 1,556 to 1,856.

She became a nationally renowned motivational speaker. Biography Aslaug Haviland was born in Bergen, Norway, January 19, 1913. At age 12 she contracted scarlet fever, and as a result lost both her hearing and vision. Little is known about her early life except that after the loss of her hearing she first attended Norway's school for the deaf, where she learned sign language, and later went on to attend the Royal School for the Blind. At the age of 16, Haviland's family was able to save up enough money to send her to the Perkins School for the Blind. There was not, however, enough money for anyone to travel with her, so Haviland traveled alone by boat to Boston. She recorded that all of the individuals on the boat, including the captain, looked after her. Even though she was ill for both the journey and most of her time in Boston, Haviland had a great desire to learn English. Though Haviland returned to Norway after her studies at the Perkins School for the Blind had finished, she eventually was able to teach herself English. Haviland married and had a son, George. In 1952 she, her husband Arne, and her son immigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Aslaug and her son joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Norway, and in 1958 after the death of her husband, she and George immigrated to the United States and traveled to Utah. Haviland moved to Murray, and over time became known as \\"Utah's Helen Keller\\". Haviland was a popular speaker in Utah and the west coast, giving both motivational speeches and training on handicaps and rehabilitation. Haviland spoke to the general public at open meetings, but also to professional and government organizations, including both the Governor's Advisory Council for the Visually Handicapped and the Coordinating Council of Organizations and Agencies Serving the Blind at their 1974 conference at Brigham Young University. Haviland was also heavily involved in planning and implementing job training programs for the deaf and blind. Despite her double handicap, Haviland strove for independence and had a strong desire to learn new things. In 1977 she was given a scholarship to attend a nine-week ceramics class at the Salt Lake Art Center school. The class was designed specifically for the blind, and Haviland was named one of the \\"star pupils\\". Haviland's son George would go on to graduate from the University of Utah and serve an LDS mission in Denmark. He worked as an admissions counselor at BYU. Haviland was made an American citizen in 1964. Though Federal Judge A. Sherman Christensen offered to waive the repetition of the oath of citizenship, Haviland requested to be able to participate in the ceremony. Senator Wallace F. Bennett reported that it was \\"one of 1964's most unusual naturalization cases\\". An arrangement was made by which as the judge read the oath, a friend of Havilands translated it into sign language and tapped it out into Haviland's palm. Haviland died in Utah on January 6, 2003, at the age of 89. References External links * Haviland, George Arne. Aslaug Haviland Scrapbooks and Memoir. Provo, Utah: L.

The union was founded in 1866 when Peter Shorrocks convened a conference in Manchester of local societies of tailors. The conference was hugely successful, with 67 societies sending representatives, and 31 others sending messages giving their support to the formation of a national union. By the end of the year, membership of the new Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Tailors was more than 7,000, with the large majority of local societies in England and Ireland signing up, although the Scottish Amalgamated Society of Tailors remained separate.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B. Smethurst, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.5, pp.427-428 The union campaigned for agreements on local wages, and where disputes arose, the union generally won by launching strike action in a single town. The union also campaigned against subcontracting and homeworking, and the employment of women. This last point became increasingly controversial within the union and, in 1900, it finally created a female section, and changed its name to the \\"Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses\\". Members of the Female Section paid lower contributions, but also receive fewer benefits from the union. In 1905, 900 members in London split away, led by James MacDonald, to form the London Society of Tailors and Tailoresses, after their requests to operate on a largely independent, federal basis were rejected. Despite this, the Amalgamated Society continued to grow, reaching 12,000 members in 1911, and including workers in closely related trades from 1927, when it adopted the name Amalgamated Society of Tailors, Tailoresses and Kindred Workers. This enabled it to maintain membership levels despite a reduction in the number of jobs in the industry, due to increased mechanisation. In 1932, on the suggestion of the Trades Union Congress, it merged into the Tailors and Garment Workers' Union, which was renamed as the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers.

Steel mills generate steel from iron. Farms make food from water. Hydrolysis reactors break water apart into oxygen and fuel. Glass kilns produce glass from oxygen and silicon. Electronics factories produce electronics from silicon, carbon, and aluminum. Chemical refineries produce chemicals from carbon and fuel. Finally, money can be produced by selling stockpiles of resources. Supply and demand fluctuates constantly. If a player is buying large sums of glass for an expansion, their rival could be gearing up glass kilns to make a handsome profit. The game also offers more direct ways of engaging a player. Through the black market, a player can purchase anything from underground nukes that wipe out resource pockets to mutinies that divert a rival's wealth into their pocket. When a player purchases something from the black market, however, its price rises, giving a wary opponent a chance to prepare a defense, usually in the form of a goon squad. The goon squad protects a single structure from most sabotage actions, capable of stealing the sabotage for yourself. The end goal of the game is to buy a majority stake in every offworld trading company in the game. If a player loses majority stockholdership in their own company, or is subjected to a very expensive hostile takeover, they are eliminated from the game, but can elect to watch as an observer. Players are warned when an opposing player earns enough money to buy them out (but the opposing player is not alerted), which usually results in tense, desperate races to earn money. Development and release Offworld Trading Company was developed by Mohawk Games and published by Stardock. An in-development version of the game was released via early access. The full game was released for Windows and OS X on April 28, 2016. The game's score was written by Christopher Tin. Reception Offworld Trading Company received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics according to aggregate review website Metacritic.

After finishing unplaced on his only start as a juvenile, Moulton improved to become a high-class middle-distance performer in 1972, winning the White Rose Stakes, Prix Ridgway and Prix Henri Delamarre as well as placing second in the Dante Stakes and the Prix du Prince d'Orange. He reached his peak as a four- year-old in 1973 when he won the Premio Presidente della Repubblica and finished second in the Eclipse Stakes before recording a 14/1 upset win in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. He was retired from racing and had limited success as a breeding stallion. Background Moulton was a \\"big, strong, most attractive\\" bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind foot bred by his owner Ralph \\"Budgie\\" Moller at his White Lodge Stud. Moller sent the colt to be trained in Newmarket by Harry Wragg at his Abington Place stable. He was one of the best horses sired by Pardao who was a top-class middle-distance performer on both sides of the Atlantic, finishing third in The Derby and winning the San Juan Capistrano Handicap. He returned to stand at stud in England at the end of his racing career and sired several other good winners including the filly Sovereign whose wins included the Coronation Stakes. Moulton's dam Close Up was a winning daughter of Horama, an Irish broodmare who has been the ancestor of numerous major winners including Teenoso, Sir Percy, Rule of Law and Harayir. Racing career =1971: two- year-old season= Moulton was slow to mature and made no impact as a two- year-old, finishing sixth on his only appearance. =1972: three-year-old season= On his first appearance of 1972, Moulton recorded his first win as he won the Meldon Stakes, a maiden race over nine furlongs at Newcastle Racecourse in April before being moved up in class and distance for the White Rose Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot Racecourse. Ridden by Brian Taylor he held off a strong late challenge from the Bruce Hobbs-trained Paper Cap to win by a short head. On his next appearance the colt contested the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for The Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse in May. He was beaten half a length by Rheingold with a gap of five lengths back to Coup de Feu in third. In the 193rd running of the Derby Mouton ran prominently for a long way before finishing ninth of the twenty-two runners behind Roberto. In the late summer and autumn of 1972 Moulton was campaigned in France. On 27 August he was sent to Deauville Racecourse and started the 1.8/1 favourite for the Prix Ridgway over 1950 metres. Ridden by Lester Piggott he came out best in a close finish beating Mister Sic Top (winner of the 1971 Prix d'Ispahan) by a short head with Coup de Feu a short head away in third. In the Prix du Prince d'Orange at Longchamp Racecourse in September Moulton was badly hampered in the closing stages before finishing third to Sharapour and Mister Sic Top and was promoted to second after the winner was disqualified. Moulton was equipped with blinkers in the Prix Henri Delamarre over 2200 metres at Longchamp and won by two and a half lengths from Christmas Box. =1973: four-year-old season= On his first appearance of 1973, Moulton finished unplaced behind Scottish Rifle in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket in April. At the end of the month he finished a close-up ninth behind Rheingold in the Prix Ganay at Longchamp. Moulton was then sent to Italy for the Premio Presidente della Repubblica over 2400 metres in Rome on 27 May in which his opponents included Hoche (winner of the race in 1972), Orsa Maggiore (Oaks d'Italia) and Fernet (Premio Parioli). Ridden by Piggott he started favourite and won easily by two and a half lengths from Ferramonti. On his next appearance he finished third to La Troublerie and Some Crack in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchanp on 24 June. Following his campaign on continental Europe, Moulton returned to Britain to contest the Eclipse Stakes, which was run that year at Kempton Park Racecourse as a new grandstand at Sandown was being built. He sweated up badly before the race and caused considerable trouble in running. After launching his challenge up the centre of the course in the straight he veered right towards the inside rail, hampering Sharp Edge (winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas) and Toujours Pret (Prix d'Harcourt). He finished second to Scottish Rifle, with Sun Prince a head away in third place but appeared fortunate to avoid disqualification. At York Racecourse in August Moulton started a 14/1 outsider for the second running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. Scottish Rifle, Toujours Pret and Sun Prince were again in opposition but Rheingold was made the odds-on favourite. The 1972 winner Roberto was withdrawn shortly before the race and his scheduled jockey Lester Piggott opted to take the ride on Rheingold, going back on an informal agreement to ride Moulton if he became available. The ride on Moulton therefore went to the Welsh jockey Geoff Lewis. As the confusion over the riding arrangements reached a peak in the early afternoon Harry Wragg reportedly said to his son Geoff \\"I'm going to lunch. I'll leave it to you\\". After being several lengths behind the leaders on the turn into the straight, Moulton made steady progress along the inside rail before being switched right to make his challenge in the last quarter mile. He accelerated through a narrow gap to overtake Scottish Rifle a furlong out drew away to win by two and a half lengths with Rheingold four lengths back in third. On his final appearance Moulton contested the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. After being restrained in the early stages, he made steady progress in the last half mile, but began to struggle in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Hurry Harriet, Allez France and Sharp Edge. Assessment In the official British Free Handicap for three-year-olds of 1972 Moulton was rated the eleventh-best three-year-old colt of the year, ten pounds behind the top-rated Deep Diver. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 121, thirteen pounds behind their best three-year-olds Deep Diver and Sallust. In their annual \\"Racehorses of 1972\\" Timeform described him as \\"a grand stamp of an animal\\", with a \\"good turn of foot\\". In 1973 Moulton was rated 128 by Timeform, nine pounds behind their Horse of the Year Rheingold, a horse he had beaten by more than six lengths at York. Stud record Moulton was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Lanwades Stud in Newmarket at an initial fee of ¬£1,500. The best of his offspring included John de Coombe (Prix de la Salamandre), Stone (Premio Presidente della Repubblica, Gran Premio del Jockey Club), Hot Touch (Dante Stakes), Insular (Imperial Cup) and Good Lassie (dam of the Prix Marcel Boussac winner Ashayer). He died in 1981.

It is the sequel to The Secret Life of Pets (2016), and the second feature film in the franchise. The film features the voices of Patton Oswalt replacing Louis C.K. as Max, Kevin Hart, Eric Stonestreet, Jenny Slate, Tiffany Haddish, Lake Bell, Nick Kroll, Dana Carvey, Ellie Kemper, Chris Renaud, Tara Strong, Michael Beattie, Hannibal Buress, Bobby Moynihan, and Harrison Ford. The film was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $434.4 million worldwide against its production budget of $80 million, making less than half of its predecessor. Plot Sometime after the events of the first film, Max and Duke's owner, Katie, marries Chuck and has a son, Liam, whom Max disapproves of at first due to his rough play but eventually softens up to him. Later, Max's overprotective feelings for Liam develop into an itch which prompts Katie to get him a dog cone from the veterinarian in an effort to lower his symptoms. Max's luck changes when Duke reveals that the family is going on a road trip outside of the city. When Max and Duke's family reaches a farm owned by Chuck's uncle, Max grows unaccustomed to the farm's ways, including local sheepdog Rooster. After an incident with the farm's sheep, Rooster takes Max out to find one of the missing sheep that ran away. Rooster's teachings and encouragement to Max about acting unafraid prompts Max to successfully retrieve the sheep. Rooster allows Max to stay with him overnight as a result. Before departure, Rooster also gives Max one of his handkerchiefs as a souvenir. Before Max left, he had entrusted his favorite toy, Busy Bee, to Gidget. Unfortunately, Gidget loses Busy Bee in a cat-infested apartment owned by a cat lady. She receives cat lessons from Chloe, Mel, Buddy, and Sweet Pea in order to sneak in the apartment more easily. With the help of Norman, she successfully retrieves Busy Bee and unintentionally gets hailed as the \\"queen of cats\\". Meanwhile, Snowball, who dreams of being a superhero, meets Shih Tzu Daisy, who explains that she needs him to assist her in rescuing a White tiger cub named Hu she met on a flight back home being held captive by an abusive circus owner named Sergei. Daisy and Snowball sneak in and find the circus Hu is in. With much difficulty from Sergei's black wolves, they free Hu from the circus. However, during the escape, Daisy accidentally drops her flower clip, which the wolves use to track her down. Daisy and Snowball take Hu to Pops' apartment first; Pops reluctantly lets Hu live there at first, but due to his destruction of the apartment afterwards, Hu is kicked out and relocated to Max and Duke's apartment. Around the same time, the family returns from the trip. Sergei and his wolves track Daisy down and capture both Hu and Daisy. Sergei escapes in a train moving for the circus in which Snowball, Max, and Norman pursue while contacting Gidget for assistance in the chase. Gidget and the cats take their owner off in her car, in pursuit of the train. Max and Snowball defeat the wolves and Sergei's pet monkey, while freeing Hu and Daisy respectively. Max, using his newfound bravery Rooster gave him, successfully infiltrates the train locomotive Sergei is in. The rest of the animals go and kick him out of the train. But before they are shot by Sergei, Gidget, along with the cat lady, Chloe, Mel, Buddy, Duke, and Sweet Pea knock him out with her car and offers the animals a ride back home. Life resumes normally, with Max and Duke's family saying goodbye to Liam as he enters his first day of preschool while Hu takes up residence in his new home with the cat lady. In a mid-credits scene, Snowball raps to \\"Panda\\", which only lasts briefly before his owner, Molly, comes into the room he is in. Cast Harrison Ford joins the cast as the voice of Rooster. Production On August 2, 2016, Universal Pictures and Illumination announced a sequel to their 2016 animated film The Secret Life of Pets with director Chris Renaud and writer Brian Lynch returning, and Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy producing.

Courtney Howard of Variety magazine wrote: \\"It‚Äôs unusual for a typical Illumination broad comedy to include a heartrending message that makes parents feel less alone in their very real, visceral struggles. It‚Äôs just cloaked in a shenanigans-soaked romp about what pets do when humans aren‚Äôt looking.\\" James Berardinelli gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars but called the film \\"a perfect example of what can happen when a sequel exists simply because its predecessor made a lot of money\\". He called it \\"a disappointingly mediocre effort that doesn‚Äôt have a lot to offer potential viewers over age 10\\" saying it was unfocused and \\"essentially three separate shorts connected only by the presence of returning characters\\".

The genus was named for the English botanist Robert Allen Rolfe. There are three species, ranging from North America to South America. Allenrolfea patagonica  Description  The species of Allenrolfea are subshrubs or shrubs with erect or decumbent growth. The stems are much branched, succulent, glabrous and appear to be articulated. The alternate leaves are sessile and stem-clasping, fleshy, glabrous, their blades reduced to small, broadly triangular scales, with entire margins and acute apex. The inflorescences are terminal spikes with spirally arranged flowers. Cymes of three or five flowers are sitting in the axils of deciduous, peltate, fleshy bracts. The flowers are bisexual. The perianth consists of 4-5 joined tepals, their lobes angled and truncate distally. There are 1-2 stamens exserting the flower and an ovary with 2(-3) stigmas. The fruit in an ovoid, compressed utricle with membranous pericarp. The erect seed is brown or reddish brown, oblong, with smooth surface. It contains copious perisperm (feeding tissue), and a half-annular embryo. The chromosome basic number is x = 9.  Occurrence  The species of Allenrolfea are distributed in North America (southwestern United States), Mexico, Central America, and South America (Argentina). They grow on alkaline soils, on sandy hummocks in salt playas, and in mud flats. In the USA they are found at about 1000‚Äì1700 m above sea level.  Systematics  The first publication of the genus Allenrolfea was made in 1891 by Otto Kuntze. With this description, he replaced the invalid name Spirostachys from 1874, (which is illegitimate, as Spirostachys already existed since 1850). The type species is Allenrolfea occidentalis. The genus consists of three species: *Allenrolfea occidentalis , in North America (southwestern USA: Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah), and in Mexico. *Allenrolfea patagonica , endemic in Argentina. *Allenrolfea vaginata , endemic to Argentina. Allenrolfea is a near relative of the genus Heterostachys, which also is distributed in America. Their common lineage seems to have evolved early in the evolution of the subfamily Salicornioideae, dating back to the Early to Middle Oligocene. It might have reached America long before the other American taxa of Salicornioideae.

Location The bridge is located in a rural section of northern Hartland, spanning the Ottauquechee River a short way downstream from the North Hartland Dam. United States Route 5 is a major roadway providing local access along the Connecticut River, and is roughly paralleled by Interstate 91 to the east. Historic bridge The 1930 bridge was a four-span structure, mounted on concrete piers and abutments. The piers had rusticated and rounded ends, and the northernmost pier had an arch set between the I-beam spans. It was long, with three approach spans consisting of steel I-beam construction, and a main span consisting of Warren trusses in length. The guard rail consisted of T-shaped stanchions joined by a decorative metal latticework. The bridge was one of 1,600 built by the state after the 1927 floods, and was one of just four Warren deck truss structures built at the time.

But before he appeared, his great-nephew pre-empted him with an interview published that day with the New York Times and ABC News. Ian Conyers said about his great-uncle: ‚ÄúHe is not resigning. He is going to retire. His doctor advised him that the rigor of another campaign would be too much for him just in terms of his health.‚Äù Conyers also said that his great-uncle encouraged him to run for the seat and that he would be running for the position. Later that day, John Conyers, Jr. announced his immediate retirement. He endorsed his eldest son, 27-year-old John Conyers III, to succeed him in Congress. John Conyers III said that he did not seek his father‚Äôs endorsement and had not decided whether to run for public office. He did not collect enough petition signatures to make the ballot. Ian Conyers urged the local and national media to take ‚Äúa thorough look at all candidates‚Äù vying to replace his great-uncle. He later took down those tweets. After Republican Governor Rick Snyder held the seat vacant for over one year the election was announced as a double primary in which one contest was to finish the unexpired term of John Conyers Junior and a second concurrent election was to hold the office from 2018 until 2020. Detroit city council president Brenda Jones won the partial election , Rashida Tlaib narrowly won the full term by 800 votes. Many voters claimed intentional confusion at the format. On January 19, 2018, Ian Conyers formally announced his candidacy for the 13th Congressional District vacancy.

Merrie Melodies directed by Tex Avery and written by Jack Miller. The short was released on June 22, 1940. Plot A man tries to catch customers' attention to the circus and points out some amazing acts and sights to see. A man offers balloons for children and realizes he is very high in the air before an off-screen voice begins to show- off some acts. Such as a glutton who can eat even the most hardest and sharpest of items. He takes a bow, revealing his very flabby body shape. Next is Hot-Foot Hogan, a man who can walk over hot coals in just his bare feet. Hot-Foot demonstrates, yelling the entire time until he sits back down again. Next is a special attraction, the sensational Captain Clamour, a human cannonball. Said captain flies very far into the distance and circles the entire world before landing, showing the location stickers of places he has been. Inside a small zoo is being shown. A man sees a \\"Do Not Feed the Monkeys\\" sign but he disobeys it anyway until the monkey beats him up and calls the police. Next is an elderly stork who answers a nearby phone and struggles to talk to the person on the other line. A giant gorilla begins to approach the camera and is told of how threatening and dangerous he is, only to reveal he is actually a very nice gorilla! The voice continues on to the Flying Cadenzas, a group of men who actually can fly like birds. They fly around the entire tent and do tricks. One of them ends up falling to the ground and the one who missed him hangs up a \\"partner wanted\\" sign. Next is Miss Dixie Dare, a daring woman who will pick up a handkerchief with her teeth while riding a horse. She manages to do it, but her teeth accidentally come out. The next woman and her horse proceed to dance together before a lion tamer is shown with his lion. The tamer is doing very well, then forces open the lion's mouth, then sticks his head through it and pulls it out. This cheering makes the lion very happy so he tries it to the man, who seems to be highly surprised. A group of elephants all line up by their tails and trunks, revealing a baby elephant second to last, as well as the Professor who is on the end. He then attempts to do one of his most dangerous tricks, allowing an elephant to sit on his head. But right before the elephant does it, he chickens out and begins to cry. The final and most spectacular trick is now due to take place! The final act consists of Count Maurice Leepov climbing a massive ladder onto a tiny panel, then jump off of it into a very small tank of water. The band nearby begins to play music while the man is busy climbing up the ladder. He reaches the very top soon enough and then leaps from the wood panel... apparently not making it as the cartoon ends to the tune of Taps.

He is best known today for his collections of method books for the violin.  Biography  Gaylord Purcell Yost was born on January 28, 1888 in Fayette, Ohio. He was the only child of Charles E. Yost, the proprietor and a journalist of The Fayette Review (the only newspaper in the village at the time) and Ada Purcell, daughter of Lott. A Purcell, a well- known figure in Fayette. He started playing violin in elementary school, and by age 12, he began composing violin and piano duets. By age 15, he was the leading violin teacher in the area. In 1903, he went to further his studies at the Toledo Conservatory. He remained there through 1904, then in 1905 went to the Detroit Conservatory, where he remained until 1906. After leaving Detroit, he went to Berlin to study with renowned Russian virtuoso Issay Barmas. He moved to Indianapolis around 1907 and between 1907 and 1911 he toured as a concert artist across the United States, Europe, and South America. He began teaching at the collegiate level in 1911, as head of the violin department of the Indiana Conservatory of Music. He started teaching at Indiana University as head of the violin department in 1915, and also taught at the Indiana College of Music and Fine Arts around this time. In 1919, he moved to Pittsburgh and shortly thereafter became head of the violin department at Pittsburgh Musical Institute, a position he held for 25 years. While in Pittsburgh, he conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony and formed the Yost String Quartet. He served as the first violinist, with Roy Shoemaker, a former Pittsburgh Symphony musician and string department chair at PMI, as second violinist, Carl Rosenberg as violist, and James Younger as cellist. In 1909, he married Ella Caroline Schroeder, another violinist from Detroit. Later, in 1917, he remarried to Ruth Margaret Stuernagel, with whom he had two children: Gaylord C Yost and Sondra Yost Matter. In 1936, he earned the Doctorate of Music degree from Waynesburg College as well as an honorary membership in the Institut Litteraire et Artistique de France. In 1950, his father died. This prompted Yost to move back to Fayette in 1951 and take over his father's old newspaper. From 1954 to 1957 he served as the mayor of Fayette. He died in Fayette on October 10, 1958 at the age of 70.  Works  Yost authored numerous short compositions for violin and piano through his career. One of his pieces, \\"Ecolouge\\", won the Institut Litteraire et Artistique de France's first prize in 1939. The International Who's Who in Music and Musical Gazetteer, published in 1918, has a short list of his compositions, and also notes that they were performed by Albert Spalding, Efrem Zimbalist, Arthur Hartmann, Kathleen Parlow, Maud Powell, and Louis Persinger, among others. Yost may be more widely known for his Yost Violin System, a myriad of method books for the violin, which focus on building basic technique to solidify one's playing. Who's Who in America asserted he had made \\"revolutionary discoveries\\" with his publication of the Yost System. Some of his books include: * Studies in Pizzicato and Harmonics * Exercises for Change of Position * Scale and Arpeggio Studies * Key to the Mastery of the Finger Board * Key to the Mastery of Bowing * Bow and Finger Magic * Spivakovsky Way of Bowing * Key to the Mastery of Double-Stopping * Studies in Finger Action and Position Playing Many of his method books are considered indispensable in violin technique.

It is known as salt sandspurry or lesser sea-spurrey. S. marina is a sprawling annual or sometimes perennial, with stems up to long. Like other sea-spurrey species, its flowers have white to pink petals, with sepals usually longer than the petals, at . Plants are salt-tolerant, being found by the sea and in saline areas inland. Taxonomy The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Arenaria rubra var. marina, and was subsequently treated as a full species in different genera, including Arenaria and Spergula. The Plant List accepts the placement in Spergularia . The species was placed in the genus Spergularia by J.Presl and C. Presl in 1819, who considered the specimens they saw to be a new species (S. salina), but several authors had previously elevated Linnaeus' variety to species rank, and the earliest of these brings nomenclatural priority, even though that species was transferred to Spergularia after 1819. The nomenclature has been complicated by some errors. In 1822 Wilibald S. J. G. von Besser created the name Spergularia marina, but based his analysis on a 1788 species name in Arenaria published by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth, who intended to move Linnaeus' variety to a full species. Roth was unaware that Carlo Allioni had previously, in 1785, elevated the variety to Arenaria marina, so Roth's name is now considered a homonym. Besser's name Spergularia marina is now considered to be based on Allioni's name and consequently on Linnaeus' variety name; it brings nomenclatural priority from 1785. A further error that has caused authors to come to different conclusions about the correct name for the species, is a name thought to have been published by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776. That phantom name came about because Carl Friedrich von Ledebour cited it after misreading Arenaria maritima as A. marina.

Life and career Gregg was born on a farm in Phoenix, New York in 1880 and graduated from Cornell University in 1903. He joined the U.S. Weather Bureau in 1904 as an assistant observer in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He also served at stations in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Mount Weather, Virginia before being assigned to Washington, D.C. in 1914 as the assistant chief of the new Aerological Section. He served as chief of that division from 1917 until 1934, when he was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to succeed Charles F. Marvin as chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau. Gregg died in 1938 at age 58 from coronary thrombosis while attending an aviation conference. Legacy and impact During his career, Gregg established himself as an expert in both meteorology and aviation. His assignments included serving as meteorological observer to the Smithsonian Institution expedition to Mount Whitney (1914), special meteorological advisor at Trepassey, Newfoundland for the trans-Atlantic flight of the Curtiss NC seaplanes of the U. S. Navy (1919), and meteorological advisor at Mineola, New York for the visit of the British dirigible R34 (1919). As an administrator at the Weather Bureau, Gregg advocated for improved scientific methods and technologies. Many of his recommendations were put into effect, including air mass methods of weather analysis, six-hourly maps, additional upper air sounding stations for the improvement of weather forecasts, and regular radio broadcasts to pass weather information along to pilots every thirty minutes. He assisted the United States Army in designing searchlights for anti-aircraft defense. He also oversaw an overhaul of how the bureau forecasted hurricanes in 1935. He hired a group of men from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to join the Bureau's staff and invited Sverre Petterssen to lecture to forecasters. As a skilled bureaucrat, Gregg lobbied the United States Congress to increase appropriations for research and weather stations while making the case for an activist Weather Bureau. He claimed that \\"comparatively small increases for weather research\\" could reduce crop failures, raise nutritional standards, diminish damage and injury from storms, and make travel by land, air, and sea safer. Gregg authored numerous influential technical articles, chapters, and one book, Aeronautical Meteorology (1925). Gregg served on a number of committees, boards, and commissions, including the International Meteorological Organization, the Commission on Projections for Meteorological Charts, the International Ice Observation Service and the Ice Patrol Service, the Daniel Guggenheim Committee on Aeronautical Meteorology, and as chair of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and its Subcommittee on Meteorological Problems. He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Royal Meteorological Society, Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences, National Aeronautic Society, American Geophysical Society, and president of the American Meteorological Society. Norwich University awarded Gregg an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1937. Gregg was named one of the \\"100 Most Notable Cornellians\\" in 2003.

Cross-signature of Arnulf of Carinthia (890). Signum manus of Otto I (circa 970). Henry III (1049). Signum manus (sometimes also known as Chrismon) refers to the medieval practice, current from the Merovingian period until the 14th century in the Frankish Empire and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of monogram or royal cypher. History The term Chrismon was introduced in New Latin specifically as a term for the Chi Rho monogram. As this symbol was used in Merovingian documents at the starting point of what would diversify into the tradition of \\"cross-signatures\\", German scholarship of the 18th century extended use of the term Chrismon to the entire field.Chrismon in Meyers Konversations-Lexikon 4th ed. (1888/9). In medievalist paleography and Diplomatik (ars diplomaticae, i.e. the study of documents or charters), the study of these signatures or sigils was known as Chrismologia or Chrismenlehre, while the study of cross variants was known as Staurologia.from stauros \\"stake, cross\\"; the same term Staurologia in a different context may also refer to the field of Theology of the Cross. Chrismon in this context may refer to the Merovingian period abbreviation I. C. N. for in Christi nomine, later (in the Carolingian period) also I. C. for in Christo, and still later (in the high medieval period) just C. for Christus. Gatterer (1798), p. 64f. A cross symbol was often drawn as an invocation at the beginning of documents in the early medieval West. At the end of documents, commissioners or witnesses would sign with a signum manus, often also in the form of a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian documents of the 7th and 8th centuries.Garipzanov (2008:161f) A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the signum manus of the moneyer.Garipzanov (2008:163f) The tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were box monograms. The first cruciform monogram was used by Justinian I in the 560s. Tiberius III used a cruciform monogram with the letters R, M for Rome and T, B for Tiberius; Pope Gregory III used the letters G, R, E, O.Garipzanov (2008:173) The earliest surviving Merovingian royal charters, dating to the 7th century, have the box monograms of Chlothar II and Clovis II.Garipzanov (2008:167) Later in the 7th century, the use of royal monograms was abandoned entirely by the Merovingian kings; instead, royal wax seals were first attached to the documents, and the kings would sign their name in full. The signum manus in the form of a modified cross symbol first appears in charters of both Frankish Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th and early 8th century. Charlemagne first used his cruciform monogram, likely inspired by the earlier papal monograms, in 769, and he would continue to use it for the rest of his reign. The monogram spells KAROLVS, with the consonants K, R, L, S at the ends of the cross-arms, and the vowels A, O, V displayed in ligature at the center.Garipzanov (2008:172) Louis the Pious abandoned the cross monogram, using again a H-type or box monogram.Garipzanov (2008:182) See also *Christogram *Rota (papal signature) *Royal cypher References *Ildar H.

Of the ten children born to the couple, six survived. They included: * Anna (1739‚Äì1766) * J√≥zef Paulin Sanguszko (1740‚Äì1781) * Krystyna Justyna (1741‚Äì1778), wife of Franciszek Bieli≈Ñski, together parents of Tekla Teresa Lubienska * Hieronim Janusz (1743‚Äì1812) * Kunegunda * Janusz Modest (1749‚Äì1806)  Society career  On 3 May 1745, she was awarded the Austrian Order of the Starry Cross.Dunin-Borkowski, Jerzy Sewer.

She took over the management of her late husband's affairs, especially the education of their children. That same year she procured the services of a French tutor, C. F. Pyrrhys de Varille, who remained on the estate in Lubart√≥w, virtually continuously until her death. After her daughter Krystyna's marriage in 1763 to Francis Bieli≈Ñski, she took up permanent residence in the Bielinski Palace in Warsaw. Following the premature death of her daughter, Krystyna, she took charge of her granddaughter, Tekla Teresa, whom she educated in the French manner. Every two years in the summer months she organised an √©lite Enlightenment salon in Poddƒôbice attended by distinguished guests. Modelled on a French 18th-century salon, she hosted intellectuals, artists and politicians. Among her guests were Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the future king, and Ignacy Krasicki. Together with Bona Granowska and her sister, Maria Lanckoro≈Ñska, she formed 'the trinity of devout ladies' famed for their piety and philanthropy. Barbara Sanguszko was celebrated for her generosity. She not only restored many Catholic churches and convents, but laid the foundations of new religious houses, including Orthodox churches. At her instigation, Pope Pius VI granted indulgences by papal bull to four parishes. Having in mind the future of her children and of the family estate, she took an active part in the political life of her country. She took it upon herself to attend parliaments and tribunals. Her soir√©es spawned the future theatrical initiatives of the Lazienki Palace. She hosted grand occasions in the Saski Palace, including illuminations, concerts and balls for dignitaries of the period. This ensured her attendance at the coronation of King Stanislas August. Apart from her real estate in Warsaw, she was mistress of estates in Szyman√≥w, Zas≈Çaw, Lubart√≥w and Poddƒôbice. She travelled widely across Poland to places including, Gda≈Ñsk, Bia≈Çystok, Berdycz√≥w, and abroad to Rome.

Numbering 700,000 in 2006, Punjabis represent the largest ethnicity among British Asians, and are a major sub-group of the British Indian and British Pakistani communities, and represent. History The United Kingdom is home to the largest Punjabi diaspora. Immigration from the Punjab region to the UK began during the colonial era, when Punjab was a province of British India. Punjabi migrants in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were mainly domestic servants, seamen working on British merchant ships and visiting civil servants or students seeking professional qualifications. A notable early figure was Duleep Singh, former Maharajah of the Sikh Empire, who was exiled to Britain in 1853. His daughter Sophia Duleep Singh became a prominent suffragette and a pioneer of women's rights in Britain. The first significant Punjabi migration began in the 1950s when labour shortages in the UK following the Second World War led the British administration to encourage recruitment from across the Commonwealth.Pirkko Pitk√§nen, Ahmet I√ßduygu, Deniz Sert (2012), Migration and Transformation:: Multi-Level Analysis of Migrant Transnationalism, Springer Science & Business Media, page 22 The vast majority of these migrants were men from India and Pakistan, who after a period of acclimatisation began to settle permanently and invite their friends, wives and children to join them.Thandi, S.S. (2015) ‚ÄòPunjabi Migration, Settlement and Experience in the UK‚Äô, in Rajan, S.I., Varghese, V.J., and Kumar Nanda, A. (eds.) Migration, Mobility and Multiple Affiliations: Punjabis in a Transnational World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 105‚Äì130. These migrants often found work in the manufacturing, textile and service sectors, including a significant number at Heathrow Airport. The town of Southall in west London became an early hub for Punjabi migrants, and would become the country‚Äôs premier British Asian town, dubbed Little Punjab. In the 1970s, there was widespread migration of Punjabis from East Africa, many of whom had retained their British passports following the independence of Kenya and Uganda. East African Punjabis are known as twice migrants, and came to the UK amidst growing discrimination at home, symbolised by the Expulsion of Asians from Uganda in 1972. Unlike earlier Punjabi migration to the UK, East African Punjabis migrated as families. Many were successful businessmen or professionals with savings and able to adjust quickly to life in Britain.Siobhan Laird (2008), Anti-Oppressive Social Work: A Guide for Developing Cultural Competence, SAGE, page 52 Demographics In the 2011 UK Census, 273,000 people identified Punjabi as their first language. Of these, 271,000 were in England, 23,000 in Scotland, 1,600 in Wales and a smaller number in Northern Ireland. Thus, Punjabi is the third most commonly spoken language in the UK. The Southall area of Greater London is home to a significant Punjabi population. The total population of Punjabis in the UK is estimated to exceed 700,000. Immigrants from the Pakistani province of Punjab are mainly Punjabi Muslims, with smaller numbers of Christians. The majority originate from the northern and central parts of Punjab, such as: Jhelum, Jhang, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Attock, Chakwal, Chiniot, Sargodha, Toba Tek Singh and Lahore. Punjabis are estimated to comprise one- third of the British Pakistani population, making up the second largest sub- group after Mirpuri Kashmiris. The tribes to which British Pakistani Punjabis belong include Jats, Gujjars, Awans, Arains, Rajputs and several others. The population of Indian Punjabis in the UK has been estimated at 466,563 in 2011, based on an earlier estimate that they constitute 45% of the British Indian community. Of these, majority are Sikhs while the rest are mainly Punjabi Hindus. The majority of British Sikhs belong to the Jat clan. The areas where they predominately originate from are Jalandhar, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Moga. The UK has the second largest Sikh diaspora outside India, after Canada. Culture Punjabi culture strongly defines the identity of British Punjabis. The bhangra form of music was popularised by Punjabi immigrants in the UK during the 1970s. England has long been associated with the Asian Underground scene which gave rise to Punjabi pop music, especially among the younger generations. Punjabi cuisine is also highly popular in the country. Chicken tikka masala has been called a \\"national dish\\" of Britain. Punjabis are known for their entrepreneurial activities. Research by Teesside University shows that the British Punjabi community is one of the most highly educated and successful in the UK. Notable businesspeople include Sir Anwar Pervez and Surinder Arora who rank amongst the wealthiest Britons. Other Punjabis have achieved notability in the theatres of British politics, sports and entertainment.

After completing her education, Bronson became the first Guidance and Placement Officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. She served as executive secretary for the National Congress of American Indians, which was founded in 1944, and created their legislative news service. After a decade of work in Washington, D.C., Bronson moved to Arizona. There she served as a health education specialist for the Indian Health Service. Upon her retirement from the government, she received the Oveta Culp Hobby Service Award from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. She continued working for Native American rights, promoting their development and leadership in the private sector until her death. Early life On behalf of ‚ÄúThe Committee of One Hundred‚Äù, Ruth Muskrat Bronson presents G. E. E. Linquist‚Ä≤s book The Red Man In The United States (1919) to President Calvin Coolidge; on the right is Rev. Sherman Coolidge, co-founder of the Society of American Indians, December 1923. Ruth Margaret Muskrat was born on October 3, 1897 in White Water, on the Delaware Nation Reservation in Indian Territory to Ida Lenora (n√©e Kelly), an Irish-English transplant from Missouri, and James Ezekial Muskrat, a Cherokee. His ancestors had traveled the Trail of Tears from Georgia to Indian Territory in the late 1830s during Indian Removal. When she was ten years old, she witnessed the disruption caused to the lives of her nation when the Curtis Act of 1898, an amendment of the Dawes Act, applied allotment of communal lands to the Five Civilized Tribes. At the age of fourteen, Muskrat enrolled in preparatory school at the Oklahoma Institute of Technology in Tonkawa, graduating in 1916. She furthered her education at Henry Kendall College in Tulsa and at Northeastern State Teachers College. Financial hardship forced her to stop classes, and she taught for two years to earn sufficient funds to continue her schooling. In 1919, Muskrat enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, where she studied for three semesters. During the summer of 1921, she worked for the YWCA and was sent to work on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico. Her report on her organizing efforts earned her a scholarship to attend the University of Kansas, where she studied for three more semesters. In 1922, Muskrat went to Peking, China for an international youth conference as part of a YWCA delegation. She was one of the first Native American women to serve as a student delegate abroad. The trip, which included stops in \\"Hawaii, Manchuria, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong.\\" brought Muskrat to the attention of the international press. She was inspired to work for racial equality. The following year, Muskrat delivered an appeal to the United States government for better educational facilities for Native Americans. She made the presentation at a gathering of Native American leaders, which was known as the \\"Committee of One Hundred\\", to advise the president on American Indian policy. Muskrat advocated for Indians to be involved in solving their own problems. Moved by her speech, President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, Grace, invited Muskrat to lunch with them. In 1923, she enrolled in Mount Holyoke College and in 1925 graduated with a BA in English. During her college days, Muskrat was a prolific poet, influenced by the Modernist movement. Career After graduation, Muskrat began working at the Haskell Institute as a teacher, and then as head of the college placement bureau. She won the Henry Morgenthau Prize in 1926 for best use of her college education in the first year graduation. In 1928, Muskrat married John F. Bronson and they adopted a native girl. In 1931, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) created a new program to improve educational opportunities for Native Americans. Bronson was appointed as the first Guidance and Placement Officer of the bureau and tasked with helping graduates find viable employment. In 1937, she was awarded the Indian Achievement Medal of the Indian Council Fire, the second woman to have received the award since its inception. She had previously been nominated for the award in its inaugural year in 1933. Bronson was in charge of distributing government loans and scholarships for students, as well as helping them find jobs. She worked at the BIA until 1943. Ruth Muskrat Bronson, 1947 Bronson spent a few years out of the workforce raising her daughter. During this period, she wrote and published several books and articles, including Indians are People Too (1944), The Church in Indian Life(1945), and Shall We Repeat Indian History in Alaska? (1947). In 1945, Bronson began working with the recently established National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and soon emerged as a leader. She was appointed as the executive secretary of the organization and spent a decade monitoring legislative issues. She also established the NCAI's legislative news service. During this period, she spoke at numerous tribal meetings throughout the country, promoting Native American progress. Bronson advocated such issues as native water rights along the Colorado River, native rights in the Territory of Alaska, and gaining quality medical care for American Indians. After ten years of serving as executive secretary, in 1955 Bronson was elected as treasurer of the NCAI. Tired of the contentiousness of national politics, she focused on ways to work directly with local communities. In 1957, Bronson moved to Arizona, where she served as a health education specialist at the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation for the Indian Health Service (part of the Department of Health and Human Services). During the same period, she served as a vice president of the philanthropic ARROW Organization. She managed the education loan and scholarship fund of the organization, as well as advising tribes on community development. In 1962, Bronson was awarded the Oveta Culp Hobby Service Award from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for her work serving Native Americans and retired from government service. She moved to Tucson. In 1963, Bronson became the national program chairman of the Community Development Foundation‚Äôs American Indian section. The organization operated under the umbrella of the Save the Children Federation. After a stroke in 1972, Bronson slowed, but did not stop her activism for Native Americans. She advocated their determining their own development and leadership programs. In 1978, Bronson was among recipients of the National Indian Child Conference's merit award for commitment to improving children's quality of life. Bronson died on June 12, 1982, in Tucson, Arizona.

During the course of a long career with the quasi-military ministry, between 1972 and 1987 he was Commander of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment. Life Bernhard Elsner was born in K√∂nigsberg, the capital of East Prussia which at that time was part of Germany. His father was a coachman. When he was six the Nazi Party took power in Germany. By the time he was thirteen war had resumed. He attended middle school locally before undertaking a traineeship, between 1941 and 1944, as a machine fitter. He undertook his National Labour Service in 1944 and then, towards the end of the year, volunteered for military service. He was captured in 1945 and spent the years from 1945 till 1949 in a Soviet Prisoner of War Camp. By the time of his release his home region had been subjected to a comprehensive ethnic cleansing programme and subsumed into Russia. Elsner settled further to the west, in what was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, where he joined the People's Police. Towards the end of 1949 the occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), a new separated German state with political and economic institutions consciously modelled on those of the Soviet Union. In 1950 Elsner joined the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which had been created four years earlier and was by now effectively consolidating its role as a new ruling party for a second German one-party dictatorship. During the next year, 1951, he joined the recently formed Ministry for State Security (Stasi), entering its prestigious \\"Adlershof Guards' Battalion\\" (later renamed as the \\"Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment\\"). In 1952 he was promoted to the rank of company commander. Five years later, relaunched in 1954 as the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, the former Adlershof Battalion had itself grown to the point where it comprised ten battalions along with various support companies: in 1957 Bernhard Elsner became Chief of Staff for the regiment's First Battalion. Following a period of preparatory training, from 1958 till 1959 Elsner was in Moscow where he studied at the military institute. On his return he became Chief of staff for the Number 1 commando group, and in 1960 he became officer for military sciences in the Regimental Staff Group Number 1. In 1964 he became deputy commander of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment and in 1962 he became the regimental Chief of Staff.

It is one of two relatively unmodified one-room schoolhouses in the town that were built in 1849. It is presently managed by the local historical society as a local history museum. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The District No. 5 School is located in a rural area of eastern Petersham, on the northeast side of East Road just south of its junction with Harty Lane. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and a stone foundation. The street-facing facade houses a single door, which provides access to the building. The side walls each have two windows. Trim consists of simple pilasters at the corners, and an entry surround with pilasters, transom window, and paneled entablature. The interior of the school has a vestibule area, which then opens into the classroom. The wall separating the spaces is vertical tongue-and-groove, with an original Federal-period door. The classroom walls are finished in vertical tongue-and-groove wainscoting, with plaster above. Floors appear to be original planking, and the original desks occupy much of the space. The town of Petersham, incorporated in 1754, established a district school system consisting of thirteen districts. The present district 5 schoolhouse was built in 1849, and is one three school buildings from the 1840s to survive in the town. It was built on land purchased by the town in 1803, at which time the district's second schoolhouse was built. The present school was built as a replacement of the 1803 building. District schools were formally abolished in Massachusetts in 1866, but this school remained open until 1880, and served one term in 1888 before being shuttered. In 1907, the town sold the vacant building to four former students, whose association held reunions at the school, and then donated it to the local historical society in 1941, stipulating that it be maintained and preserved.

Following the abolition of the County Borough of Salford it continued to function as Salford Magistrates' Court until 2011, when that body merged with the equivalent court of Manchester to form the Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court. The property is now owned privately. It is a Grade II Listed Building, having been so designated on 31 January 1952. History The foundation stone for the town hall was laid by Lord Bexley, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in April 1825. The building in which the building now stands was named after him. It was designed by Richard Lane in the Neo- classical style and completed in 1827. The building, which was originally constructed as a market hall, became the Salford's town hall in 1835 and, additionally, a courthouse in 1840. The building was expanded three times in the nineteenth century. In January 1878 it was the place where local hero Mark Addy received several awards for his gallantry in saving people from drowning in the River Irwell.Lancashire Life: A Salford Hero, April 1988 On 1 October 1931 it was the scene of the 'Battle of Bexley Square' where 10,000 protesters of the Salford Branch of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement clashed with police, an event which is commemorated with a plaque on the building. The building became the headquarters of the County Borough of Salford and continued to be called Salford Town Hall, notwithstanding that Salford was granted city status in 1926. It ceased to be the local seat of government when the county borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 and Swinton and Pendlebury Town Hall became the meeting place for the enlarged local authority area, known as the City of Salford, in 1974. Salford Town Hall was used as a court house until the last two court rooms closed in December 2011. It was subsequently sold to private developers, who completed converting the building into apartments in November 2015. Architecture The building was designed by Richard Lane, and was his first architectural project. Lane would go on to design several further prominent buildings in what is now Greater Manchester, including the Friends Meeting House in Chorlton-on-Medlock and Chorlton Town Hall, both of which have similar designs to Salford Town Hall. The building is constructed in the style of the Neo-classical style, with a minimalist entablature of the Doric Order. Only the front of the building is faced with stone; the sides are red brick.

Its origins date back to late 1983, when a group of former members of the old Liberal Party Youth decided to form the Liberal Movement, supporter of individual freedoms and the restoration of democracy by peaceful means. Among its members were Hern√°n Errazuriz Talavera, who would be ambassador to the United Kingdom during the government of Patricio Aylwin, medical director Arturo Brandt, Gast√≥n Ureta, Gonzalo Gazmuri, Guillermo Toro and Claudio Cerda. Eventually, it started taking a decidedly oppositional character to Pinochet's regime, which led them to join the Democratic Alliance in October 1984. Subsequently signed the National Agreement and constituted the ephemeral Democratic Federation () in 1985 with the National Party and the Republican Party. It made its first convention in October 1986. The alignment of the liberals with the opposition led some critics party members decided to secede from the main Liberal Party. These factions, separated between 1985 and 1987, form the Reformist Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Reformista), the Unionist Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Gremialista) ‚Äîboth subsequently joined the National Party‚Äî and the Authentic Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Aut√©ntico), which later evolve into the Liberal Democrat Party of Chile.

It lay between the River Bann and River Bush, and was centered on Magh nEilne, the \\"plain of Eilne\\", spanning north-east County Londonderry and north-west County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. Eilne may represent the name of an original population grouping, though even in the Old Irish period who they were was forgotten. The end result of conquest first by the D√°l nAraidi and then the U√≠ Tuirtri resulted in Eilne later becoming known simply as An Tuaiscert, which survived into the late medieval period as the name of a medieval deanery and the Anglo- Norman cantred of Twescard. History In 563 the battle of M√≥in Daire Lothair (modern-day Moneymore) took place between an alliance of Cruthin kings and the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. The Cruthin suffered a devastating defeat and lost the territories of Ard E√≥lairg (Magilligan peninsula) and the Lee, which both lay west of the River Bann, with the Northern U√≠ N√©ill settling their Airg√≠alla allies in Eilne. The Cruthin afterwards consolidated themselves in the D√°l nAraidi. In the mid-7th century the D√°l nAraidi of Magh Line conquered Eilne to their north-west and one of their dynasty seems to have settled there, with this branch eventually being known as the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt. In 681, Dungal Eilni, king of the Cruthin, who was of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt was killed at D√∫n Ceithern (modern-day Giant's Sconce in parish of Dunboe, west of River Bann) along with the king of Cianachta Glenn Geimin by M√°el D√∫in mac M√°ele Fithrich of the Cen√©l Meic Ercae of Cen√©l nE√≥gain. Cathussach mac Ailello, king of Eilne and D√°l nAraidi, and claimed as having ruled the over-kingdom of Ulaid for sixteen years, was killed at R√°ith Beithech (Rathveagh, County Antrim) in 749. At the end of the 8th-century, the Airg√≠allan U√≠ Tuirtri, whose kingdom lay west of the River Bann, started to migrate into Eilne due to pressure from the encroaching Cen√©l nE√≥gain. Eochaid mac Bressal, who died in 832, was the last known king of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt to hold the over-kingship of the D√°l nAraidi. By the 10th-century, Eilne was under the control of the U√≠ Tuirtri who had also moved their client kingdom of Fir L√≠ eastwards as well. =List of kings= Below is a list of the known kings of Eilne: *D√∫ngal Eilni mac Scandail, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of D√°l nAraidi and the Cruthin after 668 to 681. *Ailill mac D√∫ngaile Eilni, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of D√°l nAraidi and the Cruthin 682-690. *C√∫ Chuar√°n mac D√∫ngail Eilni, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of D√°l nAraidi from 698 to 708, and of Ulaid from 707 to 708. *Fiachra Cossalach, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of D√°l nAraidi and the Cruthin 709-710. *Flathr√≥e mac Fiachrach, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of D√°l nAraidi and the Cruthin 749-774. Was the last king to be called king of the Cruthin. *Cathussach mac Ailello, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of Ulaid in the mid-8th century. *Cin√°ed Ciarrge mac Cathussaig, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, king of Ulaid from 774 to 776. *Eochaid mac Bressal, of the D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, died 832, the last king of Eilne from this dynasty. Religious foundations The church (or monastery) of Cuil Raithin on the shore of the River Bann lay in Eilne and was said to have been founded by Cairbre, who subsequently became its bishop. According to the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick, written in the 9th-century, the D√°l nAraidi had granted this church to Saint Patrick. Territorial expanse D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is said to have corresponded to the later baronies of Dunluce Lower and North East Liberties of Coleraine, and appears to correspond to the tr√≠cha c√©t of An Tuaiscert, which became the basis for the medieval deanery and Anglo-Norman cantred of Twescard. A sub-division of in Tuaiscirt called Cuil an Tuaiscirt, meaning the \\"nook/corner\\" of D√°l nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, was located in the north-west of the petty-kingdom near Coleraine.

Teachers around the world have free access to learning resources as well as an easy to use teacher dashboard which enables them to track student progress. The Rapid Router game and resources are mapped to the UK national curriculum computing strand for Key Stages 1‚Äì3.  History  Code For Life was founded in 2014 by volunteers at Ocado Technology, after a survey of 250 UK primary schools discovered that the majority did not have adequate access to resources or training to teach the new Computer Science curriculum. It was made open-source in 2015. When the 2020 Coronavirus lockdown forced schools in the UK to close, Code for Life opened up home learning resources to parents and caregivers to help children continue to access essential digital skills. Code for Life has over 100,000 registered users worldwide.  Rapid Router  Code For Life's first programming game, Rapid Router, teaches children the basic concepts of programming by having them guide a van through a series of increasingly complicated routes, giving them feedback on the route taken and the algorithm used. Players first learn concepts using the visual programming language Blockly before learning to translate those concepts into Python, a popular general-purpose language, to prepare them for further learning. Over 18,500 teachers use the Rapid Router game in classrooms across 133 countries, and more than 12 million games have been played.

He is currently a graduate assistant coach for the University of North Carolina's football team. Early life Davis attended Gaffney High School in Gaffney, South Carolina. Davis caught 94 passes for 1,481 yards and 16 touchdowns as a junior. As a senior, he caught 108 passes for 2,009 yards and 25 touchdowns and helped lead Gaffney to a 13‚Äì1 record and an appearance in the South Carolina state championship game. He received many accolades following the conclusion of his high school football career. Davis was chosen as a Parade All-American and named Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of South Carolina. College recruitment College career As a freshman, Davis played a considerable amount under first-year head coach Larry Fedora's uptempo, offensively focused offense, and immediately saw considerable success with the Tar Heels. A primary receiving target for quarterback Bryn Renner, Davis appeared in all twelve of UNC's games, starting the final ten games, and catching 61 passes for 776 yards over the course of the season, including five touchdowns. Davis set school freshman records for receptions and yards, and his 61 catches were the second-highest freshman total in ACC history and his 776 yards were fourth-most all-time. As a sophomore, Davis earned All-ACC honorable mention honors after completing the regular season with 48 catches for 730 yards and a team-high ten touchdowns. His 109 career receptions over the course of his first two seasons are the second-most for a Tar Heel, behind only the 113 receptions set by Hakeem Nicks. Davis also completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to T.J. Thorpe against the East Carolina Pirates, which marked his first career pass completion. Davis' junior season saw the Tar Heels add several potent offensive weapons at wide receiver and running back, but the team took a step backward in terms of overall record owing to the team's severe defensive struggles. He finished the season with 41 catches for 470 yards and six scores, tying Hakeem Nicks for most career touchdowns by a Tar Heel receiver. In the Carolina's bowl game against Rutgers, Davis broke his right tibia while attempting to catch a pass in the end zone for a touchdown and had to be assisted off of the field. The Tar Heels saw their most success during Davis' senior year, during which he was a significant weapon in the potent Carolina offense. Davis started all 14 games of the 2015 season, during which he became the Tar Heels' career leader in receptions and receiving touchdowns, and finished with a team-high 55 receptions for 638 yards and four touchdowns. In perhaps what was the highlight of the season, Davis caught the winning touchdown in Lane Stadium in Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer's final home game. The Tar Heels won the ACC Coastal Division before falling, controversially, to the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Championship game by a single touchdown. Davis graduated as UNC's career leader in receptions (a record that has since been surpassed by Ryan Switzer) and career touchdown receptions.

Biography Ki√¶rskou was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. His father was a clerk in the Police Court (Politiret). He lost both parents at the age of nine and was placed an orphanage (Det Kongelige Vajsenhus), which also provided and elementary education. After his confirmation, he began taking classes in ornamental painting at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts.

In 1830, he returned to the Academy for more training and was awarded several cash prizes for landscape painting. By 1837, the Academy was willing to recommend him for funding by the \\"Fonden ad usus publicos\\", but he chose to wait. The fund had been created by King Frederick V of Denmark in 1765 to promote the arts and sciences. In 1840, he apparently borrowed money from a brother to travel to Germany and in 1842, gained a travel scholarship from the Academy and the support of Danish Prime Minister Adam Wilhelm Moltke (1785‚Äì1864). When he returned from Munich in 1843, he was able to sell some paintings to Moltke and the Kunstforeningen. He became a member of the Academy in 1845 and a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1848 for his work on a popular book of Swedish landscapes, published by Albert Bonniers f√∂rlag. In 1863, he painted a landscape that featured Bernstorff Palace as a bridal gift for Princess Alexandra upon her marriage to King Edward VII of England. From 1865, he was the supervisor (conservator) at the Moltkeske Painting Collection and from 1867 he was a painter in residence at Charlottenborg Palace.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The house is built of ashlar in two-storeys with an 11 bay frontage and a raised parapet. It is approached via a lime- lined avenue through a set of ornate gates surmounted by the Acton family crest. The surrounding parkland is Grade II listed. History The manor of Morville was acquired in 1465 by Thomas Acton, who built a fortified manor house. That house was replaced in the early 17th century by his descendant Walter Acton. Walter's son, Sir Edward, was created a baronet in 1643 and was succeeded in turn by Sir Walter and Sir Edward. All three baronets served as MPs for Bridgnorth. The third baronet married a wealthy heiress and in the late 17th century started to remodel the early 17th century house. The work was continued after Sir Edward's death in 1716 by his son, Sir Whitmore, who also made alterations to the park and gardens. The fifth baronet made little improvement to the estate other than building the stables around 1751. When he died without a direct heir in 1791, Aldenham passed to General Sir John Acton, a distant cousin who lived in Naples and was the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Sir John never visited Aldenham. The General's grandson, Sir John Dalberg-Acton, was created Baron Acton in 1869. A noted politician and historian, Lord Acton built a substantial library circa 1865, which was demolished in the early 20th century. He was a professor of modern history at Cambridge University from 1895 and spent little time at Aldenham after 1878. He died in 1902 and was succeeded as second Baron by his son, Richard. The family still occupied the house in the early 20th century, but subsequently it was let. In the mid 20th century it was occupied by the third Lord Acton's step-mother-in-law, Lady Rayleigh, and her son, the Hon. Guy Strutt. In 1959 the estate was sold to Mr and Mrs Christopher Thompson, who undertook a major restoration project. The estate remains in private ownership and is used as a wedding and conference venue.

It is located in Dogmersfield, a small village in Hampshire, England. The land was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Doccemere feld\\". Construction of the present building began in 1728 when a 3-storey rectangular block was built in brick in the Georgian style. Additional wings were added in the late 18th century and in the Victorian era to form a three-sided square enclosing a courtyard. The square was later completed with the addition of a modern chapel. History In medieval times the manor of Dogmersfield belonged to the Bishops of Bath and Wells, who built a palace there in the 13th century, probably on the site of the present house. Henry VI was a frequent visitor and Henry VII took his eldest son Prince Arthur there to meet the latter's future wife, Katherine of Aragon, for the first time. The manor was acquired in 1539 by Henry VIII and in 1547 granted to Thomas, Lord Wriothesley, who built a house and dovecote there. During the 17th century it passed through a number of hands until being possessed by Ellis St John. He started to build the present house in 1748 but died the same year. His son and heir Sir Paulet St John, 1st Baronet completed the task, later extending both the house and the estate. During the ownership of his son Sir Henry St John-Mildmay, 3rd Baronet, the Basingstoke Canal was built through the grounds (1790-92). Following the death of the 6th Baronet, much of the parkland was sold. Engraving of Dogmersfield Park, after drawing by Neale (1818) The 7th Baronet died childless in 1929 and the remaining estate was sold to Claud Ronald Anson and later became the Reeds School (1933), then a College of the De La Salle Brothers (1956) and then the Daneshill School (1973). The building was severely damaged by fire in 1981 and was purchased, renovated and extended for use as office accommodation by the American computer company Amdahl Corporation. They sold the property in 1996 to the software company Systems Union who in turn put it up for sale in 2000. Since spring 2005, after completion of a major renovation, the manor, on 500 acres, has operated as the Four Seasons Hotel Hampshire.https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/hotels-hampshire- article-112006 References Country houses in Hampshire Grade I listed buildings in Hampshire ","title":"Dogmersfield Park"},{"id":"51238706","text":"Por Siempre Joan Sebastian (English title: Forever Joan Sebastian) is a biographical miniseries about the late Mexican singer Joan Sebastian, who is portrayed by his two sons; Jos√© Manuel Figueroa (as an adult) and Juli√°n Figueroa (as a younger man and teenager).

History =Grupo de los Ocho= In the context of political openness fostered by the Minister of the Interior, Sergio Onofre Jarpa, Government-supporter parties decided to join as a counterpart to the emergence of opposition forces such as the Democratic Alliance (centre-left) and the People's Democratic Movement (revolutionary left). Originally 8 parties organised -hence its original name, the Group of Eight (Grupo de los Ocho), characterized by their heterogeneity -they range from the nationalist right to democratic socialism- but shared its legitimacy to existing institutions after the enactment of the 1980 Constitution and the defense of the coup of 1973. These parties and movements were: * Radical Democracy (Democracia Radical, DR) * National Action Movement (Movimiento de Acci√≥n Nacional, MAN) * National Union Movement (Movimiento de Uni√≥n Nacional, MUN) * Social Christian Movement (Movimiento Social Cristiano, MSC), breakaway faction of the Christian Democratic Party led by Juan de Dios Carmona and William Thayer. * National Democratic Party (Partido Democr√°tico Nacional, PADENA) * National Party (Partido Nacional, PN) * Democratic Socialist Workshops (Talleres Socialistas Democr√°ticos, TSD), former socialist and radical militants under the leadership of Luis √Ångel Santib√°√±ez. * Independent Democratic Union (Uni√≥n Dem√≥crata Independiente, UDI) =Foundation and development= As expected, the lack of cohesion and consensus within the conglomerate led to the UDI, the PADENA and PN withdraw the coalition in July 1984. The remaining five members decided to meet in the National Democratic Agreement, officially constituted on 2 July with the aim of proposing the necessary reforms to allow for a peaceful transition to democracy. They chose Juan de Dios Carmona as chief of their executive committee. ADENA proposals -also made by the Group of Eight in May of that same year- consisted of: * Enactment of the Law on Political Parties before 1984 ended. * Call for a plebiscite in 1985 with the purpose of consulting the public the option to call earlier for parliamentary elections (planned for 1989). * Conducting parliamentary elections and installation of Congress in 1986. It had its own newspaper: La Contra, which circulated with just a single trial edition on 5 September 1984. This publication described the ADENA as ¬´a grouping of centre-right, the only party that has submitted to the government some motions designed to expedite the return to democracy through a secure and continuous process peacefully¬ª. On September 28, 1984 the Social Democratic Workers Movement (Movimiento Obrero Socialdem√≥crata) and a splinter group of the PADENA led by Apollonides Parra joined the ADENA. The categorical rejection of Pinochet to early elections and its proposed law on political parties -rejected by all sectors- led to the failure of the ADENA, which was dissolved on June 22, 1985, after the authorities lifted the state of siege in the country.

She was the wife of the biographer Leslie Stephen and mother of Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell, members of the Bloomsbury Group. Julia Jackson was born in Calcutta to an Anglo-Indian family, and when she was two her mother and her two sisters moved back to England. She became the favourite model of her aunt, the celebrated photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, who made more than 50 portraits of her. Through another maternal aunt, she became a frequent visitor at Little Holland House, then home to an important literary and artistic circle, and came to the attention of a number of Pre-Raphaelite painters who portrayed her in their work. Married to Herbert Duckworth, a barrister, in 1867 she was soon widowed with three infant children. Devastated, she turned to nursing, philanthropy and agnosticism, and found herself attracted to the writing and life of Leslie Stephen, with whom she shared a mutual friend in Anny Thackeray, his sister-in-law. After Leslie Stephen's wife died in 1875 he became close friends with Julia and they married in 1878. Julia and Leslie Stephen had four further children, living at 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, together with his seven-year-old mentally disabled daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen. Many of her seven children and their descendants became notable. In addition to her family duties and modelling, she wrote a book based on her nursing experiences, Notes from Sick Rooms, in 1883. She also wrote children's stories for her family, eventually published posthumously as Stories for Children and became involved in social justice advocacy. Julia Stephen had firm views on the role of women, namely that their work was of equal value to that of men, but in different spheres, and she opposed the suffrage movement for votes for women. The Stephens entertained many visitors at their London home and their summer residence at St Ives, Cornwall. Eventually the demands on her both at home and outside the home started to take their toll. Julia Stephen died at her home following an episode of rheumatic fever in 1895, at the age of 49, when her youngest child was only 11. The writer, Virginia Woolf, provides a number of insights into the domestic life of the Stephens in both her autobiographical and fictional work. Life alt=Photo of Little Holland House in Kensington, later demolished in 1875 Saxonbury, the Jacksons' home in alt=Photo of Saxonbury, the home of Julia Jackson from 1866 to 1870 = Family of origin = Julia Stephen was born in Calcutta, Bengal, then the capital of British India, on 7 February 1846, as Julia Prinsep Jackson. Her parents, Maria \\"Mia\\" Theodosia Pattle (1818‚Äì1892) and John Jackson (1804‚Äì1887), belonged to two Anglo-Indian families, although Maria's mother, Adeline Marie Pattle (n√©e de l'Etang), was French. Her father was the third son of George Jackson and Mary Howard of Bengal, a Cambridge educated physician who spent 25 years (1830‚Äì1855) with the Bengal Medical Service and East India Company and a professor at the fledgling Calcutta Medical College. While Dr Jackson came from humble origins, but had a successful career that brought him into circles of influence, the Pattles moved naturally in the upper echelons of Anglo-Bengali society. Maria Pattle was the fifth of eight sisters famed for their beauty, verve and eccentricity, and who inherited some Bengali blood through their maternal grandmother, Th√©r√®se Josephe Blin de Grincourt. They spoke Hindustani among themselves, and were a sensation on their visits to London and Paris. By contrast with the colourful Maria, Jackson was less overt, and tolerant of her passion for her friend, the poet Coventry Patmore. Jackson and Maria Pattle were married in Calcutta on 17 January 1837 and had six children, of whom Julia was the youngest, the third of three surviving daughters, Adeline Maria (1837‚Äì1881), Mary Louisa (1840‚Äì1916) and Julia (see Table of ancestors). They had two sons George and Corrie (1839‚Äì1841) and a daughter Julia (b. 1840), who died in infancy. The Jacksons were a well educated, literary, and artistic proconsular middle-class family. = Early life (1846‚Äì1867) = Julia's two older sisters were sent to England for reasons of health in 1846 to stay with her mother's sister Sarah Monckton Pattle and her husband Henry Prinsep, who had recently leased Little Holland House in Kensington. Julia and her mother joined them in 1848 when Julia was two. Later the family moved to Well Walk, Hampstead. Her father followed them to England, from India, in 1855, the family living in Hendon at Brent Lodge on Brent Lane, where Julia was home schooled. Julia's sisters, Mary and Adeline were married shortly after. Adeline married Henry Vaughan (\\"Harry\\") in 1856 and Mary married Herbert Fisher in 1862, leaving Julia as her mother's companion and caretaker. Her mother's long history of ill health dates from around 1856, and Julia would accompany her on her travels to find remedies. On one of these, where they visited her sister (now Mary Fisher.) in Venice in 1862, she encountered her new brother-in-law's friend, Herbert Duckworth (1833‚àí1870), whom she would later marry. In 1866 the Jacksons moved to Saxonbury, in Frant, near Tunbridge Wells. There she would meet the agnostic biographer Leslie Stephen (1832‚Äì1904) later that year, shortly before his engagement to Minny Thackeray. Stephen eventually became her second husband. He described Saxonbury as ‚Äúa good country house with a pleasant garden and two or three fields‚Äù. The Pattle sisters and their families (see Pattle family tree) provided important connections for Julia and her mother. As Quentin Bell, Julia's grandson, described it, they had \\"a certain awareness of social possibilities\\". Sarah Monckton Pattle (1816-1887), had married Henry Thoby Prinsep (1792‚Äì1878), an administrator with the East India Company, and their home at Little Holland House was an important intellectual centre and influence on Julia, that she would later describe to her children as \\"bohemian\\". Little Holland House, a farmhouse on the Holland estate, that served as the dower house, was then on the outskirts of London, and nicknamed the \\"Enchanted Palace\\", where Sarah Prinsep ran the equivalent of a French salon. Quentin Bell states that Julia was \\"largely brought up in\\" Little Holland House. The house was also frequented by Leslie Stephen. One of the Prinsep's sons, another of Julia's many cousins, was the artist, Valentine Cameron Prinsep (1838‚Äì1904). Another of Maria Jackson's sisters was Virginia Pattle (1827‚Äì1910), who married (1850) Lord Charles Eastnor, later the third Earl Somers (1819‚Äì1883). Their eldest daughter (Julia's cousin) was Lady Isabella Caroline Somers-Cocks (1851‚Äì1921), the temperance leader, while the younger, Lady Adeline Marie (1852‚Äì1920) became the Duchess of Bedford. Julia and her mother were frequent guests at Eastnor Castle, the home of Lord Charles and Lady Virginia. Another maternal aunt, and also her godmother, Julia Margaret Pattle (Julia Margaret Cameron 1815‚Äì1879), was a celebrated photographer, who took many photographs of her niece, and created a photograph album for her sister, Maria in 1863 (the Mia Album). Sarah Prinsep, and her sisters, were adept at making great men feel at ease, and they frequented her house. There one might find Disraeli, Carlyle, Tennyson and Rossetti taking tea and playing croquet, while the painter George Frederic Watts (1817‚Äì1904) lived and worked there, as did for a while Edward Burne-Jones (1833‚Äì1898). It was at Little Holland House that Julia came to the attention of these Pre- Raphaelite painters and also William Holman Hunt (1827‚Äì1910), for all of whom she modelled as well as (see Gallery I) Frederick Leighton (1830‚Äì1896). She was also introduced to writers such as William Thackeray (1828‚Äì1909) and George Meredith (1828‚Äì1909), and formed a friendship with Thackeray's daughters, Anne (1837‚Äì1919) and Harriet Marian \\"Minny\\" (1840‚Äì1875). Julia was much admired, her mother observing that every man who met her in a railway carriage fell in love with her, and indeed everyone did love her. Leonard Woolf described her as \\"one of the most beautiful women in England\\". In 1864, at the age of 18, she declined marriage proposals from both Hunt and the sculptor, Thomas Woolner, another Pre-Raphaelite, who was devastated when she married three years later. Leslie Stephen remarked that Hunt only married his second wife, Edith Waugh, because she resembled Julia. Another sculptor for whom she modelled, and who was enamoured with her, was Carlo Marochetti (1805‚Äì1867). She was his model for the memorial to the young Princess Elizabeth (daughter of Charles I), when she was 10 years old, and he created a bust of Julia Jackson that is now at the Charleston Farmhouse, in Sussex. Throughout her life, she had no lack of admirers. These included the U.S. Ambassador, Russell Lowell.} and Henry James. At she was tall for a Victorian woman and had large, practical hands, deriding \\"the lovely filbert nails which are the pride of many\\", shunning vanity, fashion and afectation. = Marriage =  (1) Herbert Duckworth 1867‚Äì1870  alt=Photograph of Julia Duckworth On 1 February 1867, at the age of 21, Julia became engaged to Herbert Duckworth, a member of the Somerset landed gentry, a graduate of Cambridge University and Lincoln's Inn (1858), and now a barrister and they were married on 4 May at Frant. Julia Margaret Cameron took a number of portraits of her during this period, which Cameron considered symbolic of transition. The marriage was a happy one, Julia later stating \\"no one had tasted more perfect happiness...the greatest happiness that can fall to the lot of a woman\\". Julia's second husband, Leslie Stephen, had known Herbert Duckworth from when they were at Cambridge together ten years earlier. He described him as \\"the kind of man who might be expected to settle down as a thorough country gentleman ... simple, straight forward and manly ... a singularly modest and sweet-tempered man‚Äù. Leslie Stephen felt \\"a touch of pain\\" later, in writing about the purity of their love, commenting on her letters to Herbert, he stated that she \\"made a complete surrender of herself in the fullest sense: she would have no reserves from her lover, and confesses her entire devotion to him\\". As he read through Julia's letters to Herbert after her death, Leslie had misgivings in comparing \\"the strength of her passion\\" at this stage of her life to her later marriage to himself. The Duckworths lived at 38 Bryanston Square (see images of exterior and interiors), Marylebone, London, a townhouse belonging to the Duckworth family, and the following year, their first child was born on 5 March 1868. Two other children followed in quick succession. Their third child, Gerald Duckworth, was born six weeks after his father's premature death in September 1870, at the age of 37, from an undiagnosed internal abscess. He was said to be reaching for a fig for her, while they were visiting Julia's sister (now Adeline Vaughan) at Upton Castle, New Milford, Pembrokeshire, when it ruptured. Within twenty-four hours, he was dead. Julia and Herbert Duckworth had three children; * George (5 March 1868 ‚Äì 1934), a senior civil servant * Stella (30 May 1869 ‚Äì 1897), died aged 28 * Gerald (29 October 1870 ‚Äì 1937), founder of Duckworth Publishing.  Mourning 1870‚Äì1878  alt=Photographic portrait of Julia Duckworth in the early 1870s dressed in mourning Married for only three years, Julia was devastated by her husband's death, lying on his grave at his family home of Orchardleigh, near Frome, Somerset. She stated that she was no longer \\"inclined to optimism\\", but rather taking on a \\"melancholy view of life\\", indeed, to her \\"life seemed a shipwreck...The world was clothed in drab shrouded in a crape-veil\\", but kept herself going for the sake of her children. She related this to Leslie Stephen later \\"I was only 24 when it all seemed a shipwreck, and I knew that I had to live on and on ... And so I got deadened\\". At the same time, her grief imbued her with a sense of stoicism and awareness of suffering and she made a decision to reject religion, and it appeared, the possibility of happiness. Leslie Stephen observed that \\"a cloud rested even upon her maternal affections ...it seemed to me at the time that she had accepted sorrow as her lifelong partner\\", and that \\"she was like a person reviving from drowning\\" and sometimes felt as if \\"she must let herself sink\\". It was then that she took up nursing the sick and dying to make herself useful, and began studying the agnostic writing of Leslie Stephen. As Leslie Stephen described it \\"She became a kind of sister of mercy. Whenever there was trouble, death or illness in her family, the first thing was to send for Julia, whether to comfort survivors or to nurse the patients\\". After her husband's death, she joined her parents who had moved to Freshwater, Isle of Wight. It was also a period when she spent extensive visits to her aunt, Julia Margaret Cameron's home in Freshwater, who took many photographs of her (see Gallery II). She also resisted her aunt's efforts to persuade her to remarry. = Friendship to courtship = Julia had become aware of Leslie Stephen through both his writings on agnosticism, and through a mutual friend, Anne Thackeray (Anny, 1837‚Äì1919), the writer and daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray (see Stephen family tree). Stephen had married Anny's younger sister Minny (Harriet Marian) Thackeray (1840‚Äì1875) in 1867, the same year as Julia's marriage, but she died in childbirth in 1875, leaving him with a handicapped daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen (7 December 1870 ‚Äì 1945). After Harriet's death, Stephen lived with Anny and he became closer to Julia, who helped them move to 11 Hyde Park Gate (when the house numbers were changed in 1884, it became number 20) in South Kensington in June 1876, next door to her at number 13 (later 22). This was a highly respectable part of London, and Leslie Stephen himself had been born at number 14 (later 42). It was hoped that Julia's children would provide some companionship for Laura, who was becoming increasingly difficult to manage, and in 1877 he made Julia one of Laura's guardians. Leslie Stephen and Julia Duckworth had developed a close friendship, as she added him to her list of those who needed caring for, and had visited Leslie and Minny the night of her death. Each was busy mourning, and saw the friendship as just that. In that friendship, they were able to share their ideals of sorrow, duty and spiritual convalescence. Leslie Stephen, a former Cambridge Don and man of letters, \\"knew everyone\\" in the literary and artistic scene, and came from a respectable upper-middle- class family of lawyers, country gentlemen and clergy. In January 1877, Leslie Stephen decided he was in love with Julia, writing \\"There was a music running through me... delicious and inspiring. Julia was that strange solemn music to which my whole nature seemed to be set\\". He proposed to her on 5 February, however, Anny also became engaged to her cousin at the same time, to his displeasure, although Julia intervened on Anny's behalf. Julia declined Leslie's offer of marriage and they agreed to remain friends, although developing an intense correspondence. At the time she entertained thoughts of committing herself to a life of chastity and the happiness she envisaged could be found in a convent. When Anny Thackeray married on 2 August 1877, Julia would soon change her mind, and it was a proposal to install a German housekeeper, Fra√ºlein Klappert, that brought the matter to a head, for both realised this would separate them. Woolf would later speculate that \\"perhaps there was pity in her love\\" in addition to \\"devout admiration for his mind\\".  (2) Leslie Stephen 1878‚Äì1895  alt=Photograph of 22 Hyde Park Gate with commemorative plaques for the Stephen family On 5 January 1878, Julia Duckworth and Leslie Stephen became engaged, and on 26 March they were married at Kensington Church, although she spent much of the period in between nursing her uncle, Henry Prinsep, at Watts' house in Freshwater, till he died on 11 February. Julia was 32 and Leslie was 46. After spending several weeks visiting her sister, Virginia, at Eastnor Castle, Leslie and his seven-year- old daughter Laura moved next door to Julia's house at 13 (22) Hyde Park Gate (see image), where she continued to live for the rest of her life, and the family till her husband's death in 1904. Meanwhile, she continued her modelling career, Burne-Jones' Annunciation being completed in 1879, and their first child, Vanessa, was born shortly after on 30 May. Julia, having presented her husband with a child, and now having five children to care for, had decided to limit her family to this. However, despite the fact that the couple took \\"precautions\\", \\"contraception was a very imperfect art in the nineteenth century\\", and three more children were born over the next four years. Angelica Garnett describes Adrian, the last, as \\"an unwanted child [who] was spoiled, over protected and inhibited\\". It was a happy marriage, as Leslie Stephen describes it, a \\"deep strong current of calm inward happiness\\". Of their children, he wrote \\"our own children were to her a pure delight. To see her with a baby on her breast was a revelation, and her love grew with their growth\\". The Stephens both had aristocratic connections, were considered to belong to the \\"intellectual aristocracy\\" and despite Leslie Stephen's obsession with money and fear of poverty, were quite well off financially. They belonged to a social strata of the well educated, who though not wealthy, had inherited sufficient resources to pursue their chosen vocations, a group that at the time was well defined. To many, the Stephens were the ideal Victorian parents, a leading man of letters and a woman admired for beauty, wit, bravery and self-sacrifice. He treated her as a goddess, and in return she pampered him. However, Julia informed him that she could never give up her nursing vocation, and that \\"I may be called away to nurse people for weeks or have invalids in my house for weeks\\". In the early 1880s Leslie Stephen read Froude's life of Carlyle (1882). Like many of his contemporaries he was shocked to learn how badly (he considered) Carlyle had treated his wife, Jane Welsh and wondered if anyone would consider his marriage to have the same flaws, and indeed both shared the tendency to be domestic tyrants. Leslie, who had been a keen mountaineer in the 1860s, suffered a breakdown in 1888 connected with his work on the Dictionary of National Biography, necessitating a three-week visit by them to the Swiss Alps, an occasion documented by Leslie's friend Gabriel Lopp√©, including one of their particular favourites, in which Julia is peering out of a sunlit hotel room (see below). Laura Stephen became increasingly problematic with outbursts of violence and, confined to a separate part of the house, required her own nurse to feed and clothe her. Eventually she was sent away to a governess in Devon in 1886 and eventually an asylum (Earlswood Asylum 1893‚Äì1897 in Surrey). The family had little contact with her after that. In 1891, Vanessa and Virginia Stephen began the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, while the following year the Stephen sisters also used photography to supplement their insights, as did Stella Duckworth. Vanessa Bell's 1892 portrait of her sister and parents in the Library at Talland House (see image 5, below) was one of the family's favourites, and was written about lovingly in Leslie Stephen's memoir. = 22 Hyde Park Gate = Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, lay at the south east end of Hyde Park Gate, a narrow cul-de-sac running south from Kensington Road, just west of the Royal Albert Hall, and opposite Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, where the family regularly took their walks (see Map). Built in the early nineteenth century as one of a row of single family townhouses for the upper middle class, it soon became too small for their expanding family. At the time of their marriage, it consisted of a basement, two storeys and an attic. In 1886 substantial renovations added a new top floor, converted the attic into rooms, and added the first bathroom. It was a tall but narrow townhouse, that at that time had no running water. The servants worked \\"downstairs\\" in the basement. The ground floor had a drawing room, separated by a curtain from the servant's pantry and a library. Above this on the first floor were Julia and Leslie's bedrooms. On the next floor were the Duckworth children's rooms, and above them the day and night nurseries of the Stephen children occupied two further floors. Finally in the attic, under the eaves, were the servant's bedrooms, accessed by a back staircase. The house was described as dimly lit and crowded with furniture and paintings. Within it the younger Stephens formed a close-knit group. Life in London differed sharply from that in Cornwall, their outdoor activities consisting mainly of walks in nearby Hyde Park, and their daily activities around their lessons. = Talland House (1882‚Äì1894) = St Ives, c. 1882‚Äì1895|alt=Photo of Talland House, St Ives during period when the Stephen family leased it Leslie Stephen was in the habit of hiking in Cornwall, and in the spring of 1881 he came across a house in St Ives, and took out a lease on it that September. Although it had limited amenities, its main attraction was the view overlooking Porthminster Bay towards the Godrevy Lighthouse, which the young Virginia could see from the upper windows and which was to become the central figure in her novel To the Lighthouse (1927). It was a large, square house, with a terraced garden, divided by hedges, sloping down toward the sea. Each year between 1882 and 1894, from mid-July to mid- September, the Stephens leased Talland House as a summer residence. Leslie Stephen, who referred to it as \\"a pocket-paradise\\", described it as \\"The pleasantest of my memories... refer to our summers, all of which were passed in Cornwall, especially to the thirteen summers (1882-1894) at St Ives. There we bought the lease of Talland House: a small but roomy house, with a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill, with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia, a grape-house and kitchen-garden and a so-called ‚Äòorchard‚Äô beyond\\". It was in Leslie's words, a place of \\"intense domestic happiness\\". For the children it was the highlight of their year, Virginia Woolf later described a summer day in August 1890 in her diary (22 March 1921) with the cries of the children playing in the garden and the sound of the sea beyond, concluding that her life was \\"built on that, permeated by that: how much so I could never explain\\". The family did not return following Julia's death in May 1895. In both London and Cornwall, Julia was perpetually entertaining, and was notorious for her manipulation of her guests' lives, constantly matchmaking in the belief everyone should be married, the domestic equivalence of her philanthropy. As her husband observed \\"My Julia was of course, though with all due reserve, a bit of a matchmaker\\". While Cornwall was supposed to be a summer respite, Julia Stephen soon immersed herself in the work of caring for the sick and poor there, as well as in London. Both at Hyde Park Gate and Talland House, the family mingled with much of the country's literary and artistic circles. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James and George Meredith, as well as James Russell Lowell, and the children were exposed to much more intellectual conversations than their mother's at Little Holland House. Julia and Leslie Stephen had four children; * Vanessa \\"Nessa\\" (30 May 1879 ‚Äì 1961), married Clive Bell * Thoby (9 September 1880 ‚Äì 1906), founded Bloomsbury Group * Virginia \\"Jinny\\", \\"Ginia\\" (25 January 1882 ‚Äì 1941), married Leonard Woolf * Adrian (27 October 1883 ‚Äì 1948), married Karin Costelloe = Relationships with family and household = Much of what is known about Julia Stephen comes from the viewpoint of her husband, Leslie Stephen, and her daughter, Virginia Woolf, although the latter had only just turned thirteen when her mother died. Woolf, who stated that \\"for we think back through our mothers if we are women\\", invoked the image of her mother repeatedly throughout her life in her diary, her letters and a number of her autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921) and A Sketch of the Past (1940), frequently evoking her memories with the words \\"I see her ...\\". She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To The Lighthouse (1927) the artist, Lily Briscoe, attempts to paint Mrs Ramsay, a complex character based on Julia Stephen, and repeatedly comments on the fact that she was \\"astonishingly beautiful\\". Her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. But Woolf's understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure becomes more nuanced and filled in. While Vanessa was slightly older at fifteen when her mother died, her recollections are provided in her daughter, Angelica Garnett's memoir. As the youngest daughter, and last to marry, Julia was her mother's favourite daughter, in part due to her constant care of her mother who had many needs, and little time for maternal affection. With the premature death in 1881 of Maria Jackson's eldest daughter Adeline at 44, followed by that of her husband in 1887, she became increasingly hypochondriacal and an increasing demand on Julia's resources and necessitated her making frequent visits to Sussex as well as caring for her mother in her Hyde Park Gate Home, where she died on 2 April 1892. By contrast, Leslie Stephen observed that her father was an unobtrusive presence and \\"somehow he did not seem to count\\". Leslie Stephen writes about Julia \\"the noblest woman present\\" in tones of reverence in his Mausoleum Book, written for the children after her death. In that he was reminded of what was written about the Carlyles, and like Thomas Carlyle embarked on memorialising his wife. It was evident that he (and he was not alone in this) regarded her as a \\"beloved angel\\" and a saint, indeed as an agnostic, he had already sanctified her prior to their marriage, informing her that she replaced the Blessed Virgin. He describes her appearance as one in which her \\"beauty was of a kind which seems to imply‚Äîas most certainly did accompany‚Äîequal beauty of soul, refinement nobility, and tenderness of character\\". It is evident that she lived a life devoted both to her family and to the needs of others. Woolf drew a sharp distinction between her mother's work and \\"the mischievous philanthropy which other women practise so complacently and often with such disastrous results\\". She describes her degree of sympathy, engagement, judgement and decisiveness, and her sense of both irony and the absurd. She recalls trying to recapture \\"the clear round voice, or the sight of the beautiful figure, so upright and distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the head held at a certain angle, so that the eye looked straight out at you\\". Julia's many domestic duties included sharing the education of the children with her husband. The girls were educated to a degree at home, while the boys were sent to private boys' boarding schools (known as public schools in the UK) and then university, as was the custom of the time. There was a small classroom off the back of the drawing room, with its many windows, which they found perfect for quiet writing and painting. Julia taught the children Latin, French and History, while Leslie taught them mathematics. They also received piano lessons. Julia Stephen 1890, drawing by alt=Drawing of Julia Stephen by William Rothenastein in 1890 Julia dealt with her husband's depressive moods and his need for attention, which created resentment in her children, boosted his self-confidence, nursed her parents in their final illness, and had many commitments outside the home that would eventually wear her down. Her frequent absences and the demands of her husband instilled a sense of insecurity in her children that had a lasting effect on her daughters. Amongst her family commitments, she cared for her mother during her long period of ill health, nursed her uncle Henry Prinsep when he was dying in 1878, and her sister Adeline who died in 1881. Leslie Stephen was also prone to bouts of ill health, suffering a breakdown from overwork in 1888‚Äì1889. Leslie Stephen describes how his constant self-deprecation, was intended to elicit Julia's sympathy and attention. In considering the demands on her mother, Woolf described her father as \\"fifteen years her elder, difficult, exacting, dependent on her\\" and reflected that this was at the expense of the amount of attention she could spare her young children, \\"a general presence rather than a particular person to a child\\", reflecting that she rarely ever spent a moment alone with her mother, \\"someone was always interrupting\\". Woolf was ambivalent about all this, yet eager to separate herself from this model of utter selflessness. She describes it as \\"boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by\\" At the same time she admired the strengths of her mother's womanly ideals. Given Julia's frequent absences and commitments, the young Stephen children became increasingly dependent on Stella Duckworth, who emulated her mother's selflessness, as Woolf wrote \\"Stella was always the beautiful attendant handmaid ... making it the central duty of her life\\". At the same time, Julia's relationship with Stella, who idolised her, was frequently problematic. As Julia confided to her husband, she was especially hard on her eldest daughter because she considered her part of herself. Julia greatly admired her husband's intellect, and although she knew her own mind, thought little of her own. As Woolf observed \\"she never belittled her own works, thinking them, if properly discharged, of equal, though other, importance with her husband's\\". She believed with certainty in her role as the centre of her activities, and the person who held everything together, with a firm sense of what was important and valuing devotion. Of the two parents, Julia's \\"nervous energy dominated the family\\". While Virginia identified most closely with her father, Vanessa stated her mother was her favourite parent. Angelica Garnett recalls how Virginia asked Vanessa which parent she preferred, although Vanessa considered it a question that \\"one ought not to ask\\", she was unequivocal in answering \\"Mother\\" Stella, the oldest daughter, led a life of total subservience to her mother, incorporating her ideals of love and service. Virginia quickly learned, that like her father, being ill was the only reliable way of gaining the attention of her mother, who prided herself on her sickroom nursing. Against this background of over committed and distant parents, suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family must be evaluated. These include evidence of sexual abuse of the Stephen girls by their older Duckworth halfbrothers, and by their cousin, James Kenneth Stephen (1859‚Äì1892), at least of Stella. Laura is also thought to have been abused. The most graphic account is by Louise DeSalvo, but other authors and reviewers have been more cautious. Other issues the children had to deal with was Leslie Stephen's temper, Woolf describing him as \\"the tyrant father\\". alt=Sophie Farrell, Cook at 22 Hyde Park Gate Julia's grandson, Quentin Bell (1910‚Äì1996) describes her as saintly, with a certain gravitas derived from sorrow, playful and tender with her children, sympathetic to the poor and sick or otherwise afflicted, and always called upon at times of need as a ministering angel. As he adds, \\"because of this one cannot quite believe in her\\". Yet a close reading of Leslie Stephen's memoir reveals cracks in the image of the perfection of both Julia and the marriage. Woolf's more balanced assessment seems more realistic than her father's idealised version, but her family's assessments also need to be balanced by the picture that emerges from Julia's own writings. In contrast, Vanessa maintained her idealised version of her mother, passing it on to her own daughter. Ultimately the demands on her selflessness and her tireless efforts on behalf of others became too much and started to take their toll. Like her husband (and eventually her daughters), she suffered from depression, and has been described as \\"haunted, worn down and beautiful\\" as captured, somewhat controversially, by Rothenstein's drawings of her in the 1890s, shown here. Woolf, like all the family, greatly admired her mother's beauty, and so strong was her conviction she could not accept what Rothenstein depicted, \\"my mother was more beautiful than you show her\\". Running a large household, in a towering Victorian mansion and with many commitments outside the home necessitated the supervision of the family finances and management of a large number of domestic servants, as would be common then, and indeed indispensable in such a lifestyle. This would be the subject of two of her essays. So strong were some of these ties, that Sophie Farrell, who came to work at 22 Hyde Park Gate in 1886, would continue to work for various members of the extended Stephen family for the rest of her life. Woolf provides us with a picture of her mother \\"adding up the weekly books\\". Nevertheless, it was a household run by a woman for a man, Julia believing that a woman's role ultimately was to serve their husbands. = Death = Julia Stephen's Grave, alt=Photograph of Julia Stephen's tomb at Highgate Cemetery On 5 May 1895, Julia died at her home, of heart failure brought on by influenza at the age of 49. She left her husband with four young children aged 11 to 15 (her children by her first marriage being adults, although Stella, then 26, took over her mother's duties till she was married two years later). Julia was buried on 8 May at Highgate Cemetery, where her husband, daughter Stella and son Thoby were also later interred. Julia's wealth at her death is listed as ¬£5483 17s 1d.  Work  = Artist's model = Julia Stephens is best known for being a model, not only of Pre-Raphaelite painters, but also her photographer aunt, Julia Margaret Cameron. Julia Stephen was Julia Margaret Cameron's favourite and most trusted and mutable model, (see Gallery II) documenting her moods and meditations. Cameron was fascinated to the degree of obsession by Julia, with over 50 portraits, more than any other subject. Julia's legacy is the image Cameron portrayed in her earlier days, the fragile ethereal figure with large soulful eyes and long wild hair. Most of Cameron's photographs of Julia were taken between 1864 and 1875, including a series of profiles in the spring of 1867, two of which were during her period of engagement (plates 310‚Äì311), in which Cameron portrayed Julia's cool puritan beauty as a metaphor for the symbolic place of marriage, that Cameron called \\"the real nobility I prize above all things\\". Here Cameron frames the bust with emphatic side lighting that accentuates the tautness in the swanlike neck and the strength in the head, indicating heroism and stateliness as befits a girl on the verge of matrimony. By placing the subject facing into the light, the photographer illuminates her and suggests a forthcoming enlightenment. Cameron frequently used a soft focus such as Julia Duckworth 1867 (plate 311) here. One of these portraits she titled My Favorite Picture of all my works. In this her eyes, are downcast and averted from the lens, a more sentimental effect than the dramatic frontal view of My niece Julia full face shown here. In this portrait, the subject appears to stare assertively at the photographer, as if saying: \\"I am, like you, my own woman.\\" These are in sharp contrast to the series taken during her long widowhood and mourning for her first husband (1870‚Äì1878), with its gaunt pallid facial features. Again, Cameron draws on another Victorian symbol, this time the tragic heroine whose beauty is consumed in grief. = Social activism and philanthropy = alt=Photographic portrait of Julia in the 1880s alt=Portrait of Julia taken during vacation in Switzerland in January 1889 In addition to her tireless contributions to running the Stephen household, and attending to the needs of her relatives, she worked to support friends and supplicants. She had a strong sense of social justice, travelling around London by bus, nursing the sick in hospitals and workhouses. She would later write about her nursing experience in her Notes from Sick Rooms (1883). This is a discussion of good nursing practices, demonstrating fine attention to detail. A notable passage is her description of the misery caused by bread crumbs in the bed. In addition to dispensing practical nursing advice, she undertook social advocacy on the part of the sick and poor. She published a letter of protest on behalf of the inmates at St George's Union Workhouse in Fulham \\"for giving in to the temperance movement and cutting off the half-pint of beer\\". This ration allocated to the pauper women there had been removed at the insistence of the temperance campaigners (Pall Mall Gazette, 4 October 1879). This was an institution she visited regularly. She also wrote an impassioned defence of agnostic women (Agnostic Women, 8 September 1880), arguing against claims that agnosticism was incompatible with spirituality and philanthropy (see Quotations). She also drew on her experience of ministering to the sick and dying in making these arguments. At home, Virginia Woolf describes how Julia used one side of the drawing room for dispensing advice and consolation, the \\"angel in the house\\". = Views = Julia held firm views on the role of women in society. She was not a feminist, and has been described as an antifeminist, lending her name to the anti-suffrage movement in 1889. The novelist Mary Ward (1851‚Äì1920) and the Oxford Liberal set collected the names of the most prominent intellectual aristocracy, including Julia's friend Octavia Hill (1838‚Äì1912), and nearly a hundred other women to sign a petition \\"An Appeal Against Female Suffrage\\" in Nineteenth Century in June of that year. This earned her a rebuke from George Meredith, writing facetiously \\"for it would be to accuse you of the fatuousness of a Liberal Unionist to charge the true Mrs Leslie with this irrational obstructiveness\\", pretending that the signature must belong to another woman of the same name. Rather, Julia Stephen believed that women had their own role and their own role models. She referred her daughters to Florence Nightingale (1820‚Äì1910), Octavia Hill and Mary Ward as models. Her views on the role of women in society are firmly laid out in her Agnostic Women, namely that while men and women may operate in separate spheres, their work is of equal value. However, Julia's views on women and feminism need to be evaluated within the historical and cultural context in which she lived, being thoroughly an upper middle class Victorian woman. In her particular case the \\"separate spheres\\" were reversed from the post- industrial convention of the time, Leslie Stephen working from home while she worked outside of the home. Julia and her husband's views on this were very much in keeping with the predominant ethos of the time, agreeing with \\"the vast majority of their contemporaries‚Äî that men and women played different roles in life, roles conditioned by their physiology as well as their education\\". Despite this separation within the spheres of public and private life, she advocated for professionalism and competence by women within these, a viewpoint becoming more common in her time, and exemplified by her nursing activities. Nor did her views preclude friendship with passionate advocates for women's rights and suffrage, such as the actress Elizabeth Robins. Robins recalls that her Madonna like face was somewhat misleading \\"she was a mixture of the Madonna and a woman of the world\\" and that when she came up with something more worldly, it was \\"so unexpected from that Madonna face, one thought it vicious\\". Julia Stephens was, in most respects, a conventional Victorian lady. She defended the hierarchical system of the live-in servants, the need to keep a constant watch over them, and believed a \\"strong bond\\" existed between the mistress of the house and those who serve. It was this conventionality that Woolf consciously separated herself from, in terms of a model of womanhood, with the Victorian expectations of social conformity, that Woolf described as \\"a machine into which our rebellious bodies were inserted\\". = Publications and other writings = Julia Stephen's literary canon consists of a book, a collection of children's stories and a number of unpublished essays. The first was a small volume, entitled Notes from Sick Rooms, published by her husband's publisher, Smith, Elder & Co. in October 1883, an account of her nursing experience together with a detailed manual of instruction. It was republished in 1980 and later published in conjunction with Virginia Woolf's On Being Ill (1926) in 2012. The second is a collection of stories she told to her children, entitled Stories for Children and written between 1880 and 1884. Her stories tended to promote the value of family life and the importance of being kind to animals. Sometimes, such as in Cat's Meat, they reflect the tensions in Julia's own life. She emerges from these writings as decisive, conservative, and pragmatic, with a wit that some considered almost shocking. Although she was unsuccessful in getting these published in her lifetime, they were eventually published, together with Notes from Sick Rooms and a collection of her essays, which had been in the possession of Quentin Bell, in 1993. She also wrote the biographical entry for Julia Margaret Cameron in the Dictionary of National Biography of which her husband was the first editor (1885‚Äì1891), one of the very few biographies of women to be found in this work, and an omission which drew the critical exclamation of Woolf \\"it is much to be regretted that no lives of maids ... are to be found in the Dictionary of National Biography\\". Among her essays was Agnostic women defending her philanthropy as an agnostic (see Social activism and Views), and two other essays addressing the management of households, and in particular servants.  List of publications   ** (Notes from Sick Rooms also in ), see also Excerpt ::: ::: ::: ::: * , in = Quotations =  Legacy  Julia Stephen was the mother of Bloomsbury. She has been described as an austerely beautiful muse of the Pre-Raphaelites, and her physical image comes down to us through countless paintings and photographs. George Watt's portrait of Julia (1875), originally hung in Leslie Stephen's study at Hyde Park Gate, later it was in Duncan Grant's studio at 22 Fitzroy Square for some time, and then at Vanessa Bell's Charleston Farmhouse in Sussex, where it still hangs. The family owned a number of the Julia Margaret Cameron portraits of Julia Stephen. After Leslie Stephen's death in 1904, 22 Hyde Park Gate was sold and the children moved to 46 Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, where they hung 5 of these on the right hand side of the entrance hall. Later, when her granddaughter Angelica Garnett moved into the Charleston Farmhouse in 1987, she hung them in the passageway. Other images come from the photographs of family and friends. These images formed an important link with their prematurely dead mother, for her children. Writing to her sister in 1908, Vanessa Bell refers to her wish to \\"gaze at the most beautiful of Aunt Julia's photographs incessantly\\". Otherwise, her image has been described as \\"elusive\\", for we know her largely through the construction of others, principally Leslie Stephen and Virginia Woolf, each with their own filters. As Lowe observes, Julia Stephen has been variously constructed as \\"Madonna\\", \\"Nurse\\", \\"Wife\\", \\"Mother\\" and \\"Phantom\\". Quentin Bell considers her importance measured not so much in herself as in her influence on others. This was also the position taken by Leslie Stephen at the time of her death. Many of her children, and their descendants in turn, became notable. She played a part in the development of English thought and letters at the close of the nineteenth century. Julia Stephen conformed to the Victorian male image of the ideal woman, virtuous, beautiful, capable and accommodating, symbolised in Burne- Jones' Annunciation. Her conception of life was something she conveyed to her children with great effect. Baron Annan goes so far as to point out resemblances in literary style between her writing in Notes for Sickrooms, and that of Virginia Woolf. Although Julia's daughters rejected their Victorian heritage, their mother's influence appears in Woolf's low chignon hairstyle and wearing her mother's dress in Vogue in May 1926 (see image). Vanessa Bell too, would appear in one of her mother's dresses, such as the portrait of her by Duncan Grant (see image). Woolf also wrote with her mother's pen. Throughout her life, Julia Stephen was a prodigious letter writer, and according to Leslie Stephen, during her mother's lifetime, they \\"never passed a day apart without exchanging letters\\", often several. After her death, The Julia Prinsep Stephen Nursing Association Fund was established to commemorate the life of a woman, Leslie Stephen described as one whose \\"frank kindly ways made her many friends among the poor\\". = Virginia Woolf = The intense scrutiny of Virginia Woolf's literary output (see Bibliography) has inevitably led to speculation as to her mother's influence, including psychoanalytic studies of mother and daughter. Woolf states that \\"my first memory, and in fact it is the most important of all my memories\\" is of her mother. Her memories of her mother are memories of an obsession and she suffered her first major breakdown on her mother's death in 1895, the loss having a profound lifelong effect. In many ways, her mother's profound influence on Virginia Woolf is conveyed in the latter's recollections, \\"there she is; beautiful, emphatic ... closer than any of the living are, lighting our random lives as with a burning torch, infinitely noble and delightful to her children\\". Woolf described her mother as an \\"invisible presence\\" in her life, and Rosenman argues that the mother-daughter relationships is a constant in Woolf's writing. She describes how Woolf's modernism needs to be viewed in relationship to her ambivalence towards her Victorian mother, the centre of the former's female identity, and her voyage to her own sense of autonomy. To Woolf, \\"Saint Julia\\" was both a martyr whose perfectionism was intimidating and a source of deprivation, by her absences real and virtual and premature death. Julia's influence and memory pervades Woolf's life and work, \\"she has haunted me\\", she wrote.

It operates out of offices in Brooklyn, The Bronx, Buffalo, Manhattan, and Newburgh, New York. It was founded by Thomas Mott Osborne, former mayor of Auburn, New York and Warden of Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Osborne's family-focused programs help individuals reconnect with family members and their communities, address substance abuse problems, and prepare for employment. The organization advocates nationally for the needs of children with incarcerated parents, the rights of older adults in prison and reentry, and of the importance of prison educational programs.  History  Sing Sing prison, with warden T. M. Osborne and two other men, about 1915 In 1913, Thomas Mott Osborne, an industrialist and former mayor of Auburn, New York, voluntarily spent a week in prison. After his experience, Osborne committed himself to reforming the American prison system from society's \\"scrap heap into a human repair shop,\\"Durt, Frank. \\"The Church in the War.\\" The Christian Register. 30 May 2014. Print. to emphasize rehabilitation rather than punishment. Dedicated to the idea of a criminal justice system that \\"restores to society the largest number of intelligent, forceful, honest citizens,\\"Osborne, Thomas. \\"Prisons and Common Sense.\\" (Philadelphia: KJB. Lippincott Company, 1924): 36 Osborne went on to become a progressive warden at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, where the majority of the individuals released did not return to prison after finishing their sentences. Osborne also established the Mutual Welfare League and the National Society of Penal Information. The two organizations merged to form the Osborne Association in 1933 to continue Osborne's work.  Leadership  Elizabeth Gaynes is the president and CEO of the Osborne Association. Gaynes trained as a lawyer and began her legal career as a criminal defense attorney, working at a Buffalo, New York law firm involved in representing people incarcerated at Attica Correctional Facility during the 1971 prison uprising. Prior to coming to Osborne in 1985, she was an associate at the Pretrial Services Resource Center (now the Pretrial Justice Institute) in Washington D.C. In 2013, Gaynes was recognized as a Champion of Change by the White House for her work with children of incarcerated parents.  Programs  The Osborne Association has grown into a multi-service organization that addresses the comprehensive needs of individuals involved in the criminal justice system from arrest through reentry. Osborne now operates more than 25 programs, including employment, substance abuse treatment, healthy parenting and relationships, and release planning. In accordance with existing research demonstrating that strong family relationships promote better reentry outcomes and reduce the likelihood of recidivism. = Family-focused programs= Osborne's programming is family-focused and provides opportunities for individuals to mend, maintain and strengthen their relationships with their families. The Pew Charitable Trusts found through their research that children of parents in prison are five times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school. Osborne Association found through their research that children are two times more likely to show signs a mental health disorder, are more likely to live in poverty, and are more likely to experience attention disorders or major depression than the general population. Since 2006, Osborne has led the New York Initiative for Children of Incarcerated Parents, a 67-member coalition of government agencies and community- and faith-based organizations to \\"advocate for and support policies and practices that meet the needs and respect the rights of children and youth whose parents are involved in the criminal justice system.\\" In 2016, Osborne Association received $1.3 million by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for their Working Parents activities, particularly the Responsible Fatherhood program which helps men who were incarcerated create deeper relationships after their release with their children. Osborne has long advocated for building and maintaining strong family relationships during incarceration. They offer free, clinically-supported video visiting for children with a parent in prison. Through that program, children are able to visit via secure video connection to their incarcerated mom or dad from a comfortable, living- room like space in one of Osborne's community based offices. = Training and employment = A catering business, Fresh Start Catering, provides training and employment opportunities to individuals who graduated from Osborne Associations' catering training programs on Rikers Island. This became part of Osborne's programs in 2008, and was started in 1989 by Barbara Margolis. The Career Center was started in 2009. It offers training, career development, coaching, and assistance in getting and keeping employment.  Publications   Osborne Association (2011).

They are funded by the National Institutes of Health through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program. Although their name includes the word \\"secondary,\\" they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools. The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher. Modules Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life science curriculum. The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the teacher in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container. Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the culture to be established in the teacher's classroom. =Science Modules= ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in United States school curricula. Cannibalism and Interspecific Predation This module utilizes two species of Tetrahymena: Tetrahymena thermophilia and Tetrahymena vorax. In the lab, an extract, called stomatin, is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture. There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax. This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus. This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species. In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes =Science and Society Modules= ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit. =Elementary School Modules= External links * https://tetrahymenaasset.vet.cornell.edu/ References   Cornell University Education advocacy groups Science education ","title":"Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena"},{"id":"51238974","title":"Kadambari Jethwani"},{"id":"51238989","text":"198 Contemporary Arts and Learning, 2010 198 Contemporary Arts and Learning, also known as the 198 Gallery or 198, is an art space and gallery in Railton Road, Brixton, London, that for more than three decades has had a strong commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion.\\"About Us\\", 198.

Considered as among Turkey's most popular Anatolian rock bands, the band performed folk-driven pop and rock music and occasionally also paraphrased classic folk songs with considerable ingenuity. Their lyrics generally featured themes such as peace and freedom. History H√ºrel brothers were born in Trabzon and later moved to ƒ∞stanbul due to family business. In 1966, the brothers formed their first band, Yankƒ±lar, which was later renamed to ƒ∞stanbul D√∂rtl√ºs√º. The band performed in small music halls and tried to synthesize Turkish music and traditional rock formats.

The nearby Melchisedec Foundation Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu (; born Mihail »òtefƒÉnescu ; ‚Äì ) was a Moldavian, later Romanian historian and bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Church. A native of the Piatra Neam»õ area, he was educated at Ia»ôi and in Kiev. After a decade of teaching seminary, he became a bishop, serving at Hu»ôi, Ismail, briefly in Gala»õi and then in Roman until his death. He was involved in politics, especially around the time the United Principalities came into being, and was a steadfast supporter of Alexandru Ion Cuza's reforms, including the secularization of monastic estates. A historian appreciated by his peers, Melchisedec published over sixty works. After his death, his property and money went toward setting up the Romanian Academy Library, sending students on scholarship to Imperial Russia and establishing a foundation that continues its activities in Roman. Education and episcopal posts Born in G√¢rcina, near Piatra Neam»õ, he was descended from a line of priests. He studied at Socola Monastery's seminary in Ia»ôi, attending between 1834 and 1841 and in 1842‚Äì1843. \\"Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu\\", entry in Mircea PƒÉcurariu, Dic»õionarul Teologilor Rom√¢ni, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, Bucharest, 1996 He subsequently became a monk at age twenty, taking on the name of Melchisedec. His first post was as a teacher in »òerbe»ôti village from 1841 to 1842; this was followed by a stint as substitute professor at Socola from 1843 to 1848. He was sent to study at the Kiev Theological Academy in 1848, graduating in 1851 with a master's degree in theology and literature. Ordained a deacon at Socola in 1844, he was made a priest at the Kiev Pechersk Lavra in 1851. He undertook study visits to Odessa and Saint Petersburg, undertaking library research and perfecting his Russian-language skills.Vascenco, p. 125 In 1852, after returning home, he was made deputy archimandrite, rising to archimandrite in 1856 and being consecrated bishop in 1862. He taught at Socola from 1851 to 1856, and from that point until 1861, was teacher and director at the seminary in Hu»ôi. As a seminary teacher, he published numerous textbooks, mainly translated from Russian. His first period in charge of a diocese lasted from 1861 to 1864, when he was acting Bishop of Hu»ôi. In 1864, he was placed in the new position of Bishop of the Lower Danube, in an acting capacity; the following year, through a decree signed by Alexandru Ion Cuza, he took on the position on a permanent basis. His see was located at Ismail, where for the next fourteen years he organized the diocese and paid close attention to improving the seminary. In 1878, after the area was ceded to the Russian Empire via the Treaty of Berlin, he moved to Gala»õi.PƒÉcurariu, p. 175 The following February, he was elected Bishop of Roman, remaining there until his death.Vascenco, p. 126 At Roman, he transformed the diocesan garden into a genuine park, with flowers and fruit trees, fountains and shelters; and financed most renovations himself. He also persuaded the state to build a new, spacious seminary. In all three dioceses he led, Melchisedec imposed discipline on the clergy and hired assistants based on merit. He managed to persuade wealthy ktitors to finance village churches or help in other ways. Although busy with research, he found time for pastoral visits, dispensing valuable advice. He encouraged young people to study, giving them books and money; sent the most promising to Czernowitz or Kiev, and persuaded the Holy Synod to grant scholarships.PƒÉcurariu, p. 166 Subjected to years of attacks by the press, he was excoriated for having supported Cuza's reforms and accused of having ties to Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church. The source of these intrigues appears to have been Roman Catholic circles displeased at his pamphlet directed against their church's alleged proselytism in Romania. Moreover, he had enemies within the Synod, including Partenie Clinceni and Ghenadie Petrescu, envious of his erudition and achievements. An especial political adversary was Dimitrie Sturdza, whom Melchisedec refused to support. Moreover, Triple Alliance supporter King Carol I, to whom the bishop had been presented as a Russophile, was hostile. Taken together, these factors prevented Melchisedec's election as head of the church, both in 1875 after the death of Nifon RusailƒÉ; and particularly in 1886, following Calinic Miclescu's death.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 170‚Äì71 Political and diplomatic activity As early as 1856, Melchisedec began campaigning for the union of the Principalities, publishing a pamphlet that aimed to convince Romanian society of the wisdom of such a step. His fellow bishop Neofit Scriban wrote a similar piece, bringing the two into conflict with Ecumenical Patriarch Cyril VII.Bogdan Mo»ôneagu, \\"Locul Bisericii Ortodoxe Rom√¢ne √Æn doctrina »ôi practicile PNL\\", in Anuarul Institutului de Istorie \\"A. D. Xenopol\\", vol. XLIII-XLIV/2006-2007, p. 105 The following year, already famous throughout Moldavia, he was elected as one of four clergy representatives to the ad-hoc divan, actively participating in the union process. The deputies drafted a program for church reform, calling for autocephaly, a solution to the problem of foreign-owned monasteries and an end to the election of foreign bishops. Taken together, the document stressed the need to end dependence on Constantinople and establish an autonomous national church fit for a nation in the process of creating its political self-governance. In 1859, he joined the committee for nationalizing the monasteries' holdings. Together with Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, he drafted the law on secularization of monastic estates, and was the only bishop in the Principalities to support the policy of Cuza in this endeavor. The following spring, he became Minister of Religious Affairs and Public Instruction in the Moldavian government. The presence of a bishop in the cabinet drew objections from parliament, with the great boyars unwilling to accept the presence of a mere archimandrite in such a high position.PƒÉcurariu, p. 167 KogƒÉlniceanu responded by defending his right to serve as minister and carry out his mission of reorganizing the church and help the clergy. Nevertheless, Melchisedec resigned after a few days, wishing to avoid trouble for a cabinet that had won approval with much difficulty.Grigore Chiri»õƒÉ, Organizarea institu»õiilor moderne ale statului rom√¢n (1856‚Äì1866), p. 78. Bucharest: Editura Academiei Rom√¢ne, 1999. However, he continued to back Cuza's modernization program as a historical necessity. As a member of the Holy Synod, he worked hard to draft numerous important proposals for laws and regulations, and was essentially its key member. Indeed, the entire modern organization of the Romanian church and its religious institutes is almost entirely the work of Melchisedec.Vascenco, p. 127 A particular preoccupation, and the subject of several reports, was the obtaining of autocephaly. He belonged ex officio to the Romanian Senate. The Synod sent him to Bonn in 1875 in order to attend the Old Catholic Church conference, an early ecumenist gesture. In 1868, he was sent to the imperial court in Saint Petersburg alongside Ion Cantacuzino; the two were tasked with handing Tsar Alexander II a letter from then-Prince Carol and asked to negotiate unresolved political matters. In a letter sent to Carol earlier the same year, Otto von Bismarck, who had previously served as ambassador to Russia, expressed his confidence in the bishop's success. Indeed, he was well received by Russian officials, including the tsar, who kissed his hand out of respect. In 1887, Russian monarch Alexander III, who referred to Melchisedec as \\"the most brilliant bishop of the Romanian kingdom\\", sent the latter greetings and an expensive egolpion (small icon worn by bishops as a necklace), in recognition of 45 years' service to church and country.Vascenco, p. 128 During the Romanian War of Independence, he donated an important sum of money to the government for equipping the army. Scholarly work and legacy Elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1870, Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site he belonged to eight other scientific and cultural societies from Paris, Tarnovo, Kiev, Saint Petersburg, Athens and Constantinople. Among his admirers as a scholar were Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, a contemporary and the younger Nicolae Iorga.PƒÉcurariu, p. 171 His most important historical and philological work was Cronica Hu»ôilor. His 1871 book on the Lipovans was the first ample study of this community in Romania and its surroundings; the work covered the Romanian Old Kingdom proper as well as neighboring Bukovina and Dobruja, then under Austrian and Ottoman administration, respectively. He analyzed its hierarchy, the differences in worship from the state church and the group's demographic profile.Vascenco, pp. 124‚Äì25 In all, he published over sixty works of history, theology and teaching during a period that saw a transition from the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet to the modern Latin alphabet. Melchisedec wrote mainly in the latter script, but preferred Cyrillic writing for religious books. Melchisedec was active within the Academy: he presented reviews of books by Moses Gaster, Gheorghe Asachi and others; displayed original Moldavian decrees written in Old Church Slavonic; and proposed the publication of a collection comprising 64 sermons by John Chrysostom that he had translated from German, in an edition by Karl Josef von Hefele. (The bishop knew seven foreign languages: French, German Russian, Ancient Greek, Latin, Slavonic and Hebrew.) He presented a report about the discovery, inside the Gospel Book of Humor Monastery, of a true portrait depicting Stephen the Great; as well as a series of Slavonic documents and sermons by Anthim the Iberian. Later, the historian Constantin C. Diculescu observed that Melchisedec and Hasdeu were the first Romanian historians who appreciated the true value of early Slavonic records. He helped found the Romanian Academy Library by donating his personal library of 82 manuscripts and 2511 books, as well as a collection of 114 coins, to the Academy in his will. It was among the richest libraries in late 19th-century Romania, including books on history, literature, theology, political and social matters, pedagogy, economics, agriculture, science, medicine and art, as well as periodicals. Furthermore, the will left his fortune of 150,000 lei, a hundred beehives and two rows of houses near the cathedral to be administered by the Bishop of Roman. Every year, the income would help finance a recipient's theological studies at Kiev; among those who benefited from the scholarship were Ludovic Cosma, Ioan »öincoca, Vespasian Erbiceanu, Constantin Nazarie and Nicodim Munteanu. He also willed that a kindergarten for local children be established in one of his houses, as well as a school for church singers that would only admit orphans and provide them with free room and board. The Melchisedec Foundation was established in 1892, the year of his death; its purpose is to carry out the provisions of his will, drafted three years previously. Located in the center of Roman, the entire site is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, as are several individual buildings: the 1849 house of Doctor Teodoru, which the bishop purchased in 1886; the 1911 church singers' school; the 1915 kindergarten; and the 1938 chapel; his nearby grave is also listed.

It is partially funded by the Department of Canadian Heritage and is accountable to the Government of Canada for servicing and reporting on the Canadian book industry.  History  BookNet Canada was founded in 2002 in response to government and industry initiatives to support book publishing in Canada, with an initial mandate of \\"implementing technologically focused, universally adopted supply chain standards and solutions (including a centralized sales reporting database).\\" The first impetus to create the organization goes back to the late 1990s with the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. The committee met several times in 1999 and 2000 to assess the government's support of the book industry and the issues facing Canadian book publishing as a whole. Their research culminated in the report, The Challenge of Change: A Consideration of the Canadian Book Industry, which presented several recommendations mainly focused on the need for technological standards and reliable market data. BookNet Canada was formed out of the vestiges of the Canadian Telebook Agency (CTA), an existing organization that was already managing the closest thing to a national book database at the time, with a Board of Directors formed from representatives from the Canadian Booksellers Association, Association of Canadian Publishers, Canadian Publishers Council, and the Association of Canadian Book Wholesalers. In 2003 Michael Tamblyn was appointed as BookNet Canada's first CEO.https://www.booknetcanada.ca/press- room/2009/6/14/booknet-canada-announces-new-ceo.html With ongoing support from the Department of Canadian Heritage through the Canada Book Fund and direction from industry representatives, BookNet Canada began working on improvements to the book supply chain, starting with the creation of an electronic communications platform for the exchange of documents between supply chain partners and a national book sales tracking and aggregation service, which was launched in 2005 under the name SalesData.  Current services  =Print book sales tracking and aggregation= All print book sales in the Canadian trade market are tracked and aggregated in BNC SalesData, which is accessible to publishers and booksellers. The system collects POS transaction data as well as on-hand and on-order levels from retailers, both physical and online, with approximately 85% coverage of the print trade market in Canada. The data collected in SalesData is used to report on the size and scope of the trade book market in Canada, most notably in the annual The Canadian Book Market report. In 2015, the size of the Canadian print book market was reported at 52.6 million units sold for a total value of $983.4 million CAD (US$ million), according to BNC sales numbers. The aggregated data is also used to create national bestseller lists, including those published by The Globe and Mail and Toronto Star. =Bibliographic standards and certification= The Canadian book industry trades bibliographic data for books according to a set of national and international standards, which are established, contributed to, and upheld by BNC. To accomplish this, the organization sits on several national and international committees on standards for book metadata, identifiers, classification schemes, and electronic data interchange. It works to educate the supply chain on these standards, and oversees Canadian Bibliographic Certification to support adherence in the industry. BNC also monitors and participates in the development of other industry standards, including those for accessibility, EPUB, GDSN, SAN, and GLN. =Supply chain services= BNC operates several tools used by the Canadian book supply chain: CataList, a digital catalogue service used by publishers, booksellers, media, and librarians to host and browse forthcoming books; Pubnet EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), an e-commerce service used by the book industry to send and receive orders, shipment notices, and returns; and BiblioShare, a national database for collecting and disseminating bibliographic data on Canadian books. = Research = In addition to sales numbers, BookNet conducts industry and consumer research for the book industry, including reports on the prevalence of ebooks vs. print among book buyers.books like References External links *BookNet Canada website Non-profit organizations based in Toronto Organizations established in 2002 2002 establishments in Canada Publishing in Canada ","title":"BookNet Canada"},{"id":"51239151","text":"David Casavant (born 13 July 1990, Tennessee) is an American fashion stylist, collector and consultant based in New York City.

Later, at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, she was Assistant Historian (1966‚Äì1969) and Keeper of the Catalog of American Portraits (1969‚Äì70). At NARA (1970‚Äì1989), she worked as exhibits curator, Director of the Education Division, Microfilms Publications Coordinator, and Specialist in Women‚Äôs History. In 1976, four years before publishing her book with fellow NARA employee, Mabel Deutrich, Clio Was a Woman: Studies in the History of American Women (Harvard University Press, 1980), Purdy headed a Conference on Women's History in April 1976. Prior to this conference, NARA had identified only two sets of records that pertained to women's history: the records of the Women's Bureau and the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor. Purdy knew that there were an abundance of records about women that existed and were simply forgotten or ignored. In her work of highlighting the importance of those records and make the agency, along with the archival community, understand the importance of women's history, she became renowned for her intersectional approach to women's history.

IT-backed authoritarianism: Information technology enhances central authority and control capacity under Xi Jinpin, MERICS Papers on China, p.52-56, June 2016. It embeds political goals within algorithms. Its aim is to enhance the control capacity and authority of a non-democratic regime In contrast to traditional governance practices in authoritarian countries, IT-backed authoritarianism lowers the necessity to resort to coercion to exert power. The IT-based approach helps to establish a more subtle, automatic and invisible type of state control.  Definition  IT-backed authoritarianism refers to an authoritarian regime using cutting-edge information technology in order to penetrate, control and shape the behavior of actors within society and the economy. The basis is an advanced, all-encompassing and in large parts real-time surveillance system, which merges government-run systems and data bases (e.g. traffic monitoring, financial credit rating, education system, health sector etc.) with company surveillance systems (e.g. of shopping preferences, activities on social media platforms etc.). IT-backed authoritarianism institutionalizes the data transfer between companies and governmental agencies providing the government with full and regular access to data collected by companies. The authoritarian government remains the only entity with unlimited access to the collected data. IT-backed authoritarianism thus increases the authority of the regime vis-√†-vis national and multinational companies as well as vis-√†-vis other decentral or subnational political forces and interest groups. The collected data is utilized by the authoritarian regime to analyze and influence the behavior of a country‚Äôs citizens, companies and other institutions.Mirjam Meissner (2016). China‚Äôs surveillance ambitions, The Wall Street Journal, 2 August 2016. It does so with the help of algorithms based on the principles and norms of the authoritarian regime, automatically calculating credit scores for every individual and institution. In contrast to financial credit ratings, these ‚Äúsocial credit scores‚Äù are based on the full range of collected surveillance data, including financial as well as non-financial information.Caren Morrison (2016). How China Plans to Blacklist Financially Unstable Citizens, Fortune, 30 November 2015. IT-backed authoritarianism only allows full participation in a country‚Äôs economy and society for those who have a good credit scoring and thus respect the rules and norms of the respective authoritarian regime. Behavior deviating from these norms incurs automatic punishment through a bad credit scoring, which leads to economic or social disadvantages (loan conditions, lower job opportunities, no participation in public procurement etc.). Severe violation or non-compliance can lead to the exclusion from any economic activities on the respective market or (for individuals) to an exclusion from public services.

He was owned by Sam Tuttle of Spout Springs, Kentucky, who operated the trail riding concession at the nearby Natural Bridge State Park in Powell County, Kentucky. Tuttle was one of the few horse breeders in the area who kept his horses through the Great Depression and second World War; Old Tobe was one of as many as fifty horses that Tuttle owned and used for his trail riding business. Old Tobe was used as a trail horse, often for inexperienced riders, and was gentle enough to be tied next to mares. He also performed an ambling gait. Old Tobe was bred both to mares owned by Tuttle, and outside mares owned by other breeders. His offspring inherited his gait and disposition, and were popular in eastern Kentucky. He sired foals until he was 34, and lived to be 37 years old. He and five of his sons were named as foundation sires when the Rocky Mountain Horse Association was formed in 1986.

The company got off to a successful start with the development of the wide-angle Aristostigmat lens and the subsequent acquisition of Optical Institute Schulze and Billerbeck, the manufacturers of ‚ÄúEuryplan lenses‚Äù, as they were called at the time.  History  Studio camera \\"G√∂rlitz\\" Germany, 1930's, National Polytechnic Museum in Sofia A key business decision was made in 1920 when the company decided to work with former Zeiss developer Paul Rudolph, who was previously significantly involved in the success of the Protar, Planar and Tessar lenses. Rudolph also gave Meyer Optik access to his patent for the so-called Plasmat lenses, which at the time included one of the most powerful lenses in the world. In 1936, the company was renamed Optische und Feinmechanische Werke Hugo Meyer & Co and produced approximately 100,000 lenses a year. During World War II, civilian production discontinued and mainly optical components for telescopes were produced. After the war, the company was expropriated from the Saxony armaments industry and management under the name VEB Optisch-Feinmechanische Werke G√∂rlitz. In the post-war era, the company produced mainly Trioplan triplets, usually for viewfinder cameras produced by Dresden-based camera manufacturers Welta, Balda, Beier, and Altissa. After being integrated into the VEB Pentacon and VEB Carl Zeiss collectives, the Meyer-Optik name was no longer inscribed on lenses after 1971. Many products were discontinued in favor of competing models produced by Carl Zeiss, while the equipment required to produce high-quality zoom lenses could not be procured. In 1990, Feinoptische Werk G√∂rlitz was spun off from VEB Carl Zeiss and converted into a private limited company and started to produce lenses with the Meyer-Optik logo. However, despite privatization efforts, the company was unable to attract investors and was liquidated shortly after. In 2014, net SE, a publicly listed company (NETK) founded in 1997, working with the brand manager Globell B.V., exhibited new lenses under the Meyer-Optik-G√∂rlitz name at the Photokina trade fair and began delivering the lenses in December of the same year. In May 2015, net SE created a new subsidiary, Meyer Optik USA Inc., to distribute Meyer-Optik-G√∂rlitz brands in the United States. Meyer Optik USA is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. That same year, net SE - Globell Deutschland launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce the Trioplan f2.9/50, a special new lens that revived the tradition of a versatile \\"soap-bubble\\" bokeh lens. More recent reports have net SE, the company behind the modern Meyer Optik G√∂rlitz trademark, running what looks very much like an illegal ponzi pyramid scam, with Kickstarter implicitly assisting by tolerating breaches to its terms of service, meant to have restricted exactly this type of event from occurring. According to the report, net SE had additionally registered multiple other trademarks for respectable, but defunct, historical companies and was pursuing ways to insulate the new entities one from the other.

The EAC carried out a new election measure to require all candidates to sign an additional \\"confirmation form\\" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Article 1, Article 12 and Article 159(4) of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Localist Hong Kong Indigenous's Edward Leung and pan-democrat League of Social Democrats (LSD) Avery Ng sought a judicial review but the court refused to immediately hear the judicial reviews. Leung subsequently signed the confirmation form but was asked by returning officers whether they would still advocate independence along with some other localist candidates including Civic Passion's Alvin Cheng and Hong Kong National Party's Chan Ho-tin. After the end of the nomination period, nominations of six localist candidates, Hong Kong National Party's Chan Ho-tin, Democratic Progressive Party's Yeung Ke- cheong, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko, Conservative Party's Alice Lai Yee-man, Hong Kong Indigenous's Edward Leung and independent Chan Kwok- keung, were \\"invalidated\\"; Edward Leung's nomination was rejected by EAC returning officer Cora Ho Lai-sheung on the basis that she did not trust Leung had \\"genuinely changed his previous stance for independence.\\" Course of events =Confirmation form= On 14 July 2016, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) announced its plan to require all candidates to sign an additional \\"confirmation form\\" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Article 1 of the Basic Law, Article 12 which stated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be a local administrative region of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy and come directly under the Central People's Government, as well as Article 159(4) which stipulated that no amendment to the Basic Law shall contravene the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong (i.e. Hong Kong should be a special administrative region of the PRC under the ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù principle). Article 104 also required members of the Legislative Council to swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region before assuming office. As many potential localist candidates are advocating or promoting Hong Kong independence, the EAC stated that ‚Äúindependence of the HKSAR‚Äù was inconsistent with the constitutional and legal status of the HKSAR as stipulated in the Basic Law, as well as the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong. It also stated that returning officers were required to take into account all relevant information before deciding whether a nomination is valid according to and Electoral Affairs Commission (Electoral Procedure) (Legislative Council) Regulation 541D ¬ß 16 (the Regulation) and request the candidate to provide any other information the returning officer deems appropriate to satisfy him/her that the nomination is valid according to Sections 10 or 11 of the Regulation. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai criticised the government's move as \\"censorship of political ideas\\" and a breach of freedom of thought. Localist candidates reacted differently to the new measure. Civic Passion's Alvin Cheng signed the confirmation form when he submitted his nomination to run in the Hong Kong Island constituency. Civic Passion spokesman and New Territories West candidate Cheng Chung-tai justified the group's decision as a form of civil disobedience. Edward Leung of the pro-independence Hong Kong Indigenous who won over 66,000 votes in February's New Territories East by-election said he would not sign the form and would seek a judicial review. The pan-democrats also stated they would boycott the new election measure by not signing the additional form. =Returning officers' emails= On 22 July, Edward Leung, who had not yet signed the confirmation form, received email from the EAC asking if he would still advocate Hong Kong independence after submitting the original nomination form stating he would uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Civic Passion's Alvin Cheng and the Hong Kong National Party's Chan Ho-tin both received similar emails on 25 July. Two other localist candidates, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko and Conservative Party's Alice Lai Yee-man, received similar emails in the following days. Those questions were claimed to be a factor to determine the validity of their nominations. =Judicial review attempt= Represented by Senior Counsel Martin Lee, Edward Leung and pan- democrat League of Social Democrats (LSD) chairman Avery Ng and general secretary Chan Tak-cheung filed a judicial review, arguing that the EAC had acted beyond its powers, and accuse the government of political censorship. On 27 July, High Court judge Justice Thomas Au Hing-cheung refused to immediately hear the judicial reviews, as he said he saw no urgency in dealing with the case before the end of the nomination period. After the court's decision, Leung agreed to sign the confirmation form. =Invalidations= On 30 July, Chan Ho-tin received an email from the EAC which said his nomination in New Territories West had been \\"invalidated\\" as he did not comply with the , since he had refused to sign the additional confirmation form. A day after, Yeung Ke-cheong of the localist Democratic Progressive Party, positioned second on a candidate list with Jonathan Ho Chi-kwong in Kowloon West was also invalidated as he, unlike Chan, explicitly rejected the Basic Law by not signing both the original and additional confirmation forms to pledge to uphold the Basic Law. Yeung said he would launch a judicial review. Pro-independence candidate Nakade Hitsujiko for New Territories West became the third candidate to be disqualified on 1 August even though he had signed the new form. He had also previously run in 2015 District Council election. On 2 August, three more localist candidates were disqualified, Conservative Party's Alice Lai Yee-man in Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong Indigenous' Edward Leung who ran in February and received more than 66,000 votes in the New Territories East by-election and independent Chan Kwok-keung in New Territories East while nominations of Clarence Ronald Leung Kam-shing and Yau Man-king on Chan's list were validated. In her letter, EAC returning officer Cora Ho Lai-sheung rejected Leung's nomination with the attachment of Leung's Facebook posts, newspaper clippings and cited transcripts of his remarks at press conferences, and stated that although Leung had signed the forms, she did not believe that Leung \\"genuinely changed his previous stance for independence.\\" =Lawyers' joint statement= On 3 August, all 30 Legal Subsector members of the 1,200-strong Election Committee, which is responsible for choosing Chief Executive of Hong Kong including former Hong Kong Bar Association chairmen Edward Chan King-sang SC and Philip Dykes SC questioned whether returning officers had the power to investigate the ‚Äúgenuineness‚Äù of candidates‚Äô declarations and accordingly disqualify their candidacies. In the statement, it wrote that \\"[the Section 40 of the Legislative Council Ordinance] does not give the returning officer any power to inquire into the so-called genuineness of the candidates‚Äô declarations, let alone making a subjective and political decision to disqualify a candidate without following any due process on the purported ground that the candidate will not genuinely uphold the Basic Law.\\" It also wrote that \\"arbitrary and unlawful exercise of powers by government officials ... are most damaging to the rule of law in Hong Kong.\\" However, Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen said officers did have the power to consider some evidence, as they had done in the past. He did not specify any past cases. =\\"First pro-independence rally\\"= On 5 August, the Hong Kong independence advocates who were banned from the election launched a rally which was dubbed ‚Äúfirst pro-independence rally in Hong Kong‚Äù. The rally drew about 2500 people. The pro-independence activists vowed they would press on with their cause and campaign for wider public support.

The book was adapted for the 1963 Disney film The Three Lives of Thomasina. Plot Andrew MacDhui, a widowed veterinary surgeon working in fictional Inveranoch,Scotland in 1957 has a young daughter, Mary Ruadh, who is attached to her pet ginger cat Thomasina (who narrates some of the story). Although Mary loves Thomasina, her father MacDhui only tolerates the cat. MacDhui is a bitter and resentful atheist because his wife died young, and while he had desired to be a medical doctor to save humans, his overbearing father forced him to be a vet like himself. The village children talk of a local \\"witch\\" named Lori who is said to cure ailing animals through magic. After MacDhui refuses to help an injured frog found by Geordie McNab, the boy takes the frog to Lori and leaves it for her to heal. One day Thomasina falls ill, so Mary takes her beloved cat to her father expecting him to cure Thomasina. To Mary's shock, MacDhui has his assistant chloroform Thomasina and tells Mary that she's been euthanized. Mary recovers Thomasina's body, and her friend Hughie Stirling suggests giving her the best funeral the village children can arrange. Mary obliges and the children write on Thomasina's headboard that she was \\"foulley murdered.\\" Mary refuses to talk to her father again until he brings Thomasina back and spurns his offer of a new pet. She later confides to her father's friend, the Reverend Peddie with whom MacDhui spars over God's existence, that her father is dead and that she killed him. As time passes, Mary stops talking altogether and loses interest in life. When the funeral is over and Mary and her friends leave Thomasina's burial place in the hills, Lori appears, exhumes Thomasina's body and discovers the cat is still alive; the chloroform simply induced a deep sleep. Lori takes the cat to her own cottage to recover. When Thomasina wakes up, she thinks she is Bastet the Egyptian cat goddess, resurrected. The other animals at Lori's cottage don't believe her, especially when she tries to show her powers to them. Thomasina does not remember Mary or her former life. Lori renames her \\"Talitha\\" and keeps her. Meanwhile, Mary has become ill and is eventually confined to bed, unable to speak. As a result of MacDhui's treatment of Thomasina, many villagers have stopped taking their animals to him and instead are taking them to Lori. MacDhui goes to confront Lori over this and ends up helping her care for a badly injured badger that beyond her ability to heal. He is touched by her tenderness and learns that she also has experienced the loss of her close family. He visits her often teaching her medical skills, and they eventually join forces to rescue the starving and abused animals the gypsies camping outside of town are showing and together fight with the gypsies. Upon hearing that Mary will die soon, MacDhui goes to fetch Lori believing only she can help Mary, but overwhelmed by his vehemence, she doesn't respond. Coming upon Thomasina's grave on his way home, the inscription on the gravestone reveals his true nature to him, and he calls on God for forgiveness then returns to Mary. Lori comes at Reverend Peddie's request, and Thomasina, who has been sleeping in a drawer scented with lavender at Lori's cottage, wakes up and suddenly remembers her true identity and her past life with Mary and is impelled to make her way back to Mary through a rainstorm. When Thomasina appears at Mary's window, Lori recognizes her as the cat she rescued, the housekeeper lets her in and MacDhui hands her back to Mary. Mary is overjoyed to have her cat again and immediately starts to recover. MacDhui marries Lori and becomes a kinder veterinarian who now likes Thomasina.

She has also encouraged libraries to place special emphasis on Afro-American collections. Life and career Shockley was born in 1927 in Louisville, Kentucky. She married teacher William Shockley in 1948, and had two children named William Leslie Jr. and Tamara Ann. The couple later divorced but Shockley kept her ex-husband's last name. Shockley was encouraged to read and write creatively at a young age and was heavily influenced by Richard Wright's short story form in Uncle Tom's Children. Her eighth grade teacher, Harriet La Forest, was said to serve as Shockley's early mentor and had a large influence on Shockley's writing. She started writing for an audience in high school, where she worked as the editor for her school's newspaper. She continued to work as a journalist and column writer for various newspapers in her undergraduate studies and later graduated with a bachelor's degree from Fisk University in 1948. Shockley went on to receive her master's degree in library science from Case Western Reserve University in 1959. Shockley worked as a librarian at Delaware State College and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, before working for Special Negro Collection at Fisk University in 1969. She served as a professor of library science, university archivist, as well as an associate librarian for special collections at Fisk and founded the Black Oral History Program until she later retired in 1988. Throughout her career, Shockley published several books on librarianship and special collections, particularly related to African-American collections. She became a writer of more than thirty short stories, novels, and articles that address issues of racism and homophobia.  Major works  = Newspaper columns = Throughout July 1945 through March 1954, Shockley worked as a freelance newspaper columnist. She has several works in newspaper columns documented in Louisville Defender, Fisk University Herald, Federalsburg [MD] Times, and Bridgeville [DE] News that centered primarily around issues in the African American community and LGBT community. Her writings can be found under \\"Mostly Teen Talk\\", \\"Duffy's Corner\\", and \\"Ebony's Topics\\". = Short stories = Shockley also has many short stories that she has written, most of which center around the issues surrounding homosexuality, being African American, and being a woman. Through these short stories, Shockley sheds light on the conditions in which these people live and the impact these conditions have on their lives. A few of these short stories include \\"Holly Craft Isn't Gay\\"(1980), \\"A Meeting of Sapphic Daughters\\" (Spring 1979) which can be found in The Black and White of It (1980), as well as \\"The Eternal Triangle\\"(1948), \\"The Curse of Kapa\\"(1951), and \\"Monday Will Be Better\\"(1964), posted in various outlets such as Afro-American [Baltimore] and Negro Digest. Most of Shockley's short stories were controversial for their time. = Non-fiction = * A History of Public Library Services to Negroes in the South, 1900‚Äì1955 (1960) * A Handbook for the Administration of Special Black Collections (1970) *Living Black American Authors: A Biographical Directory (comp. and ed. with Sue P.

She often writes about LGBT+ women who are in the African American community and facing triple oppression. In writing on these topics, Shockley hoped to make people in the African American community realize their similarities as well as differences. Her first novel, Loving Her was the first of its kind as it worked to validate interracial lesbian love. It was also the first novel to use a female African American protagonist. Through her character Renay, who leaves her abusive husband for a white, rich woman, Shockley explores what being an African American, female and homosexual is like in America in the twentieth century, whom she tries to \\"normalize\\". In her collection of short stories, The Black and White of It, Shockley also stages an African American lesbian as the main characters, using successful women who are professional and strong in nature face struggles with sexuality. In \\"Play It but Don't Say it\\", Shockley places a Congresswoman as her protagonist, and in \\"Holly Craft Isn't Gay\\", the character, a successful singer, goes as far as attempting to have a child in order to appear straight. Say Jesus and Come to Me works to also confront homophobia, however it is largely critiquing the church, a theme not yet explored in Loving Her or The Black and White of It. Shockley's nonfiction works such as her section in Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology edited by Barbara Smith also confront these same issues revolving around sexuality in the African American community. Criticism The Black and White of It (1980), although generally unknown, received better response from critics as well as her short story collection Say Jesus and Come to Me (1982). Say Jesus and Come to Me in particular was said to introduce and recognize a character that typically lacks representation and appeared on the Christopher Street best seller's list, however Shockley was still criticized for her writing style and lack of structure in the stories. The collection takes a focus on the character Reverend Black, a lesbian aged forty who tries to hide her sexuality. Shockley claimed to have written the piece in order to shed light on the black church's hypocrisy of shaming homosexuals yet partaking in all other acts deemed as sins. Although recognized by authors such as Alice Walker, who gave Loving Her praise in her review of the novel in 1974 as well as Nellie McKay and Rita B. Dandridge who have acknowledged the writer, Shockley's fictional works has been often ignored by the masses if not criticized. Shockley herself attributes this lack of recognition due to the subject matter that she writes about. She claims that works addressing lesbian themes were rare at the time, as most publishers were not interested and writers were too fearful to admit to their own sexuality to push for publishing. Journals have come out that go as far to say that Shockley complicates same-gender loving as well as problematizes it through her characterizations of African American people who also happen to be homosexual. Along with this, some argue that Shockley uses too many generalizations in her texts, has a poor stylistic choice, and did not work to battle common stereotypes about black lesbianism. In her first novel, Loving Her, the main character, Renay, chooses to live her life as a lesbian but still performs stereotypically heteronormative notions on romance, which works against Shockley's supposed intentions of exposing what a lesbian relationship really is like in the late twentieth-century. Nonetheless, the fictional novel is still admit-tingly one of the first of its kind.

In her work at the Tuskegee Institute, particularly in the Department of Research and Records, she documented the lives of African Americans and maintained the Institute's lynching records.  Personal life and education  Guzman was born to David C. and Ella Roberts Parkhurst in Savannah, Georgia. She lived with her godparents, the Wragg family. Reverend Doctor John Percy Wragg was a clergyman who led the American Bible Society's Agency Among the Colored People of the South. After completing her high school education at Atlanta's Clark University in 1915, Guzman attended Howard University where she graduated with an A.B. degree in 1919. She received her M.A. from Columbia University in 1924 and continued her studies at the University of Chicago and American University. In 1940, she married Ignacio L. Guzman, a member of the Tuskegee Institute's faculty. While in college, she was a member of the sorority group, Alpha Kappa Alpha, in their South Eastern Region. She was part of the Beta Xi Omega Chapter. She died in Jacksonville, Florida on October 25, 1996.  Career  After working as John Wragg's private secretary, Guzman taught history at New Orleans College from 1922-1923. When she was 24 years old, she began her work at the Tuskegee Institute where she worked for a total of over forty years. From 1923-1929 she worked as a research assistant at the Tuskegee Institute under Monroe Work. She briefly taught at Alabama State Teacher's College during the 1929-1930 academic year and then returned to the Tuskegee Institute where she worked until her retirement in 1965. Working first under Monroe Work and later as director of the Department of Research and Records, Guzman contributed to various research projects and publications. One of her many duties under Work at Tuskegee was to compile lists of lynching victims. From 1938‚Äì1944 Ms. Guzman was the Dean of Women at the Institute, and then in 1946 became the Director of the Department of Records and Research ‚Äî a successor in her own right to Monroe Work‚Äôs legacy. In 1950, she was named the Tuskegee Woman of the Year. She compiled and edited two subsequent volumes of the Negro Year Book in 1947 and 1952. After 1953, the Race Relations Report replaced the account of lynchings. In an interview, Guzman responded that in those years, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any sense of how much lynchings were under- reported.‚Äù  Publications  * Negro Year Book (editor, 1947, 1952) * \\"The Role of the Black Mammy in the Plantation Household\\" (Journal of Negro History, 1938) * \\"Some Recent Literature By and About Negroes\\" (Service Magazine, 1947) * \\"Lynching‚éØCrime\\" (Negro Year Book: A Review of Events Affecting Negro Life, 1944-1946, 1947) * \\"Contributions to Negro Life: Establishing and Directing the Department of Records and Research at Tuskegee Institute\\" (Journal of Negro History, 1949) * Some Achievements of the Negro Through Education.

Weiher was born in Kansas City, Missouri. She earned her B.S. at the University of Missouri in 1963 and her M.A. at Georgetown University in 1967. In 1966, Weiher began working at the National Archives and Records Services (NARS), now known as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and served as Acting Deputy Archivist of the United States from 1986 to 1987 and Deputy Archivist of the United States from 1988 to 1993. At the beginning of Weiher's tenure, the National Archives and Records Services was combined with the General Services Administration. Under the leadership of sixth Archivist of the United States Robert M. Warner, Weiher worked for the independence of the National Archives from the General Services Administration by writing testimony and preparing strategy. After some Congressional battles, on October 19, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed Senate Bill 905, which established the National Archives and Records Administration as an independent agency. With the aim of helping preserve records, Weiher established \\"clean\\" reading rooms in the National Archives and Records Administration- meaning pencils only and limited bags and coats. Many researchers objected to the reduction in access, but the measures were put in place to reduce the theft of documents. Weiher served as Deputy Archivist under Archivist Don W. Wilson, and was a visible Deputy who often spoke to the media. In November 1992, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee criticized Wilson as an \\"absentee archivist\\" and credited Weiher with effectively running NARA.

Background Little Mike is a bay gelding bred by Carlo Vaccarezza, who immigrated to the United States from Italy in the 1960s. One of Vaccarezza's first jobs in America was as a groom at Aqueduct racetrack. He subsequently became involved in the restaurant industry and became the owner of two restaurants near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the mid 2000s, he obtained the mare Hay Jude from a friend, Pat Greco. Hay Jude's first foal, Little Nick by Tiger Ridge, became a multiple stakes winner for Vaccarezza. Hay Jude's second foal was Little Mike, sired by Spanish Steps, an unraced son of Unbridled with a modest stud fee of $5,000. Little Mike was named after Vaccarezza's youngest son and owned by Carlo's wife Priscilla Vaccarezza. He was originally trained by William White, then Allen Iwinski in 2010, before being transferred to the barn of Dale Romans. Racing career On July 11, 2009, Little Mike finished second in his racing debut in a 5-furlong maiden special weight race on the dirt at Calder Race Course, then lost his next three races, all sprint races on the dirt. Now trained by Allen Iwinski, Little Mike won for the first time after being switched to the turf in a one-mile race at Monmouth Park, leading the field from start to finish. He then won three allowance races and finished second in the Monarch's Maze Stakes, ending the year with a record of four wins from seven starts. On January 9, 2011 at the age of four, Little Mike made his graded stakes debut in the Fort Lauderdale Stakes at miles on the turf at Gulfstream Park. At odds of 12-1, he went to the early lead then battled down the stretch with Blues Street to win by a nose. He was then transferred to the stable of Dale Romans for the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap on February 5, his first attempt at the Grade 1 level. After leading throughout most of the race, he gave way near the finish line and finished sixth. Three weeks later in the 1-mile Canadian Turf Stakes, Little Mike again went to the early lead and set solid opening fractions. He opened up a large lead turning into the stretch and this time was able to hold off some late challenges to win in an excellent time of 1:32.37. \\"As long as he's happy and flipping his ears around, how fast he's going doesn't really matter,\\" said jockey Joe Bravo. On April 3, Little Mike repeated his front-running tactics in the Appleton Stakes and won by lengths, despite carrying the high-weight of 123 pounds. \\"I've never seen him get tired,\\" Romans said. \\"Even though he didn't win the [Gulfstream Turf Handicap], he only got beat two lengths and that was a grade I. He has been just super. He came to me in great condition. It's pretty special for him to win three graded stakes at the meet.\\" Unfortunately, Little Mike then suffered a condylar fracture and missed the next eight months, returning on December 22 to win an allowance race. He finished 2011 with a record of four wins from five starts, all at Gulfstream Park. Little Mike began 2012 with another wire to wire win at Gulfstream Park, this time in the Florida Sunshine Millions Turf at a distance of miles. He then tried to repeat his earlier win in the Canadian Stakes but faded late in the stretch to finish fourth. Little Mike then traveled to Churchill Downs for the Grade I Turf Classic on May 5, where he went off as a 12-1 longshot. He again set the early pace, then opened up a large lead turning into the stretch and won comfortably by lengths. He then shipped to Hollywood Park for the Shoemaker Mile on June 30, finishing third. Little Mike next traveled to Chicago to win the 10-furlong Arlington Million on August 18 with another front-running performance. Vaccarezza credited the win to Little Mike's tactical speed and stamina. \\"If you try to go with him on the lead, you can't stay with him and you're going to lose. And if you let him go like they did [in the Arlington Million], you're going to lose.\\" Vaccarezza said. \\"Can you believe this? I'm just a backyard kind of guy and we took a Florida-bred horse that was out of an Illinois-bred mare and we took on the Europeans in one of the biggest races in the world and we beat them\\" Little Mike's next start was on September 29 in the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at a distance of miles on a yielding turf course at Belmont Park. Little Mike went to the early lead but tired, eventually finishing well behind the winner Point of Entry in fifth. Little Mike's final race of the year was the -mile Breeders' Cup Turf on November 3, run that year at Santa Anita Park. He was a 17-1 longshot, largely because he had never won at the distance. Instead of his usual front-running tactics, jockey Ramon Dominguez rated the gelding off the pace, moved to the lead entering the stretch, and then withstood a stretch drive from the favorite Point of Entry. Romans said, \\"He's an overachiever and he's proven us all wrong. I don't think anybody up here thought he could be more than a miler last year and now we don't know where his limit is.\\" Little Mike's time was an exceptional 2:22.83, the fastest Breeders' Cup Turf ever and almost equal with the Santa Anita track record of 2:22 . He became the first American horse to win both the Arlington Million and Breeders' Cup Turf in the same year. Little Mike was named the 2012 Florida-bred Horse of the Year by the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders' and Owners' Association. His dam Hay Jude was also named the Florida broodmare of the year. Little Mike was a runner-up to Wise Dan in the Eclipse Award voting for Champion Turf Horse. Little Mike began 2013 by shipping to Dubai to prepare for Dubai World Cup Day. In his first start on March 9, he competed on an artificial dirt surface at Meydan Racecourse, finishing eighth. He then finished tenth on March 30 in the Dubai Duty Free Stakes, in which he wrenched an ankle. Returning to the United States, he finished fourth in the United Nations in July, then sixth in the Secretariat Stakes in August. \\"His races this year haven‚Äôt been that bad, if you really analyze them,\\" said Romans. \\"They were very bad set-ups, and he ran about as well as he could. Compare the difference between the Arlington Million between 2013 and '12. We went almost two seconds faster this year. They started respecting his speed a little more and went after him earlier.\\" Little Mike's sole victory of 2013 came in the Grade 1 Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at Belmont Park. He rated early, then moved to the lead around the far turn and withstood a late run to beat Big Blue Kitten by a nose. Romans said, \\"He just proved how versatile he is. I knew we needed to try something different to get him back to the level where he was last year.\\" Little Mike ended the year by finishing seventh in the Breeders' Cup Turf and ninth in the Hong Kong Cup. In 2014, Vaccarezza took over the training of Little Mike, and conditioned him to a win in the Flying Pidgeon Stakes at Gulfstream Park on May 17. Little Mike then was given a long layoff to deal with tendonitis, undergoing hyperbaric treatments and a swimming regimen. He finally returned to racing on July 10, 2016, but finished fifth. It would be his last race after accumulating 14 wins from 30 starts, with earnings of $3,543,392. Retirement Little Mike was retired at the end of July 2016 to Old Friends Equine, a thoroughbred retirement home. \\"He came out of his race fine, but the last few days he just didn't seem to have the same energy level he has had when training these past weeks and months. He came back blowing yesterday after a routine gallop. He wasn't his usual rambunctious self, and kind of looked at me and told me it was over. The one thing I can say is that he retired 100 percent sound,\\" said Vaccarezza. \\"He was everything to me and my family. To have a horse that won all those Grade 1's, who took me and my family around the world to meet so many people, it's like a dream come true.\\" \\"It's so thrilling to have him here,\\" said Michael Blowen, the president of Old Friends. \\"I'm star-struck around all these horses and he fits right in with the best we have here.\\" Pedigree Little Mike is inbred 5S x 5D to Raise a Native, meaning Raise A Native appears in the fifth generation of the sire's side of the pedigree and in the fifth generation of the dam's side of the pedigree. Little Mike is also inbred 5S x 4D to In Reality.

Biography  She was born the daughter of Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Krajewski, a royal courtier, and his wife Franciszka n√©e Kluszewska. She was home schooled in Warsaw and on the country estate. All her lessons were in French. She married a Senator, Franciszek Salezy Nakwaski, who from 1799 became prefect of the Warsaw region in the Duchy of Poland and then progressed to Voyevoda in Congress Poland. The couple had a son, Henryk, born in 1800, who was later to become a political activist and emigrant in France. They initially lived in Lipnice near P≈Çock, but often travelled to the capital where she was a member of the Society in the Palac pod Blacha and an active participant in its cultural life. In the home of Stanis≈Çaw So≈Çtyk, she got to know people like, Franciszek Salezy Dmochowski, L. Osi≈Ñski and Onufry Kopczy≈Ñski. During the Duchy period, she was an inspector of girls' schools and a member of the committee overseeing the education of women. At the same time, she pursued her own studies in Polish language and literature. After the collapse of the November uprising, she would spend the summer months on the Ma≈Ça Wie≈õ estate, returning to Warsaw for the winter months. In 1837 she left for Switzerland and after 7 years, in 1844 she visited Lower Silesia and Breslau stopping off for a cure in Szczawnica.  Creativity  From 1816 she had established a Literary salon in Warsaw, which enjoyed great popularity over many years. She wrote novels (Czarna mara, Obraz warszawskiego spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwa w dw√≥ch powie≈õciach spisany), children's stories and historical fiction based on the uprising, (Aniela, czyli ≈ölubna obrƒÖczka, Powstaniec litewski). In 1852, the Warsaw Daily, 'Gazeta Warszawska' published an extract from her memoirs and several decades later, in 1891 a further extract appeared in Kronika Rodzinna- the Family Chronicle.

The isles' MP Jo Grimond had submitted an amendment to the Scotland Bill seeking to establish a commission in the event of a successful vote for a Scottish Assembly. This amendment faced opposition from the Secretary of State for Scotland, Bruce Millan. With Jo Grimond's support, the Shetland Islands Council held the referendum to gauge the electorate's support for its position in the hope that it would give the Council a mandate to push for separate consideration for Shetland in the Bill. The question asked was: Results  Aftermath  The referendum provided a resounding victory for the Council and Grimond's position, and the Scotland Act 1978 would contain provisions for setting up a commission for Orkney and Shetland. Plans for a Scottish Assembly ultimately failed as a result of the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, ensuring a continuation of the status quo for Shetland. However, the constitutional debate fostered in part by the referendum led to the creation of the pro-autonomy Shetland Movement.

It protects the main water supply for the city of S√£o Lu√≠s, the Batat√£ reservoir. The park's environment has been badly degraded through illegal occupation, logging, removal of sand, and garbage dumping. The water supply is threatened. Location The Bacanga State Park is the S√£o Lu√≠s municipality of Maranh√£o. It has an area of . It is just south of the city of S√£o Lu√≠s, and north of the Regi√£o de Maracan√£ Environmental Protection Area, on the right bank of the Bacanga River. It lies between residential zones with high demographic pressure and the industrial district. The area surrounding the park had a population of 18,240 in 1991 and 60,564 in 2001. There is no buffer zone to prevent environmental damage around the park. The park contains the ruins of the S√≠tio do F√≠sico industrial complex, about of ruined tanneries, furnaces, tanks and warehouses. The S√≠tio do F√≠sico was one of the main industrial complexes of Maranh√£o in the early 19th century. The extensive mangrove forests nearby provided the tannin used to tan leather. The Brazilian Institute of Cultural Heritage (IBPC) is involved in preserving the S√≠tio do F√≠sico. Eletronorte electrical transmission lines cross the park from north to south. The Batat√£ water reservoir is in the east of the park, to the west of the Marechal Cunha Machado International Airport. The reservoir provides the main water supply for the city of S√£o Lu√≠s and for 30% of S√£o Lu√≠s Island. History For centuries the state of Maranh√£o has followed a policy of extracting resources to supply the metropolis. In recent years living standards have fallen, in part due to uncontrolled use of natural resources. The area occupied by the park suffered from the uncontrolled growth of the city of S√£o Lu√≠s, with damage including fires, extraction of timber and sand, garbage accumulation and so on. The Bacanga State Park was created by decree 7.545 of 7 March 1980 to conserve natural environments favorable to the development of scientific, educational and recreational activities, with an area of about . The park was made the joint responsibility of the Secretariat of State for Natural Resources, Technology and Environment (SERNAT) and the water authority (CAEMA), who operates the reservoir. Decree 7545 stated that the park's limits could be redefined to exclude areas that were irreversibly occupied or used, as long as this did not affect the characteristics of the park. On 24 April 1984 the area of the park was redefined to cover about . The reduction recognised that some areas had in fact been occupied and housing had been built. The park management plan was prepared in 1998 and updated in 2001. On 14 December 2001 another of occupied land was excluded. Environment The park has poor laterite soil that is vulnerable to fires, deforestation, and erosion. The climate is hot and humid. It is in a flat, coastal area affected by tides, with mangroves. There are small hills and valleys in the centre of the park. The park preserves a remnant of Amazon rainforest whose natural springs feed the Batat√£ Dam. The park also provides an essential environmental service in recharging the aquifers below the city. Threats Maintenance activity on the electrical lines impacts the environment. In 2001 there were small settlements with a total of 747 inhabitants within the park, felling trees, burning the vegetation and practising a primitive form of agriculture. The responsible agencies, SEMA and CAEMA, were doing little to manage the situation, allowing informal occupation and construction in the park, deforestation, degradation of ravines and gullies and so on. In 1995 satellite images showed that forest coverage was high forest 30.97%, low forest 25.90%, mangroves 17.37% and riparian forest 11.46%. Forest covered more than 85% of the ground, while land used for agriculture, bare earth and buildings covered just over 9%. In 2004 forest covered 80.61% of the area and disturbed land 16.1%. Mangrove forest had been reduced from 17.37% to 10.82%, and high forest from 30.97% to 22.60%, while low forest had risen from 25.90% to 35.49%. Deforestation had been caused by harvesting of timber for construction of houses and for firewood, and by removal of vegetation to allow stone and clay to be excavated for local sale. Between 1995 and 2004 the area covered by surface water, mostly in the reservoir, decreased from 4.33% to 3.27%. The reservoir was projected to continue shrinking, with the land around it used for construction. In 2003 the reservoir was almost empty in dry periods.

The project, set to air in late 2016 on Audience Network was ordered straight-to-series with an order of 10 episodes on August 2, 2016. The project was originally ordered in 2014 but was dropped for creative reasons. The series was then released on November 16, 2016. On June 16, 2017, the series was renewed for a second season. On July 30, 2018, the series' cancellation was confirmed via a comment from the show's official Facebook page. Plot =Season One= The series follows the lives of a Los Angeles diamond traders family business called Green & Green Diamond after recent events where one of the patriarchs sons has killed a prominent diamond dealer, while his step-brother has to bail him out and save the family business. The Green family is however trapped between doing a clean and dirty business. On one end, a Sierra Leone native, diamond dealer and philanthropists have huge interests in working with Green & Green. She forcefully integrates herself into Green & Green by blackmailing Jake Green that she needs an account of $25 million or Jake risks losing his daughter. As the season proceeds, the ailing cooperation between Isaac Green (Jake's father and the owner of Green & Green Diamond) weakens progressively and begins losing the appropriate mental judgement. Lady Rah continues blackmailing Jake into cooperating with her. This forces Jake and Freddy Green to transport illegal diamonds over the border for a buyer who was willing to settle at an amount of $20 million. They lose the diamonds to one of Lady Rah trusted operatives, however Isaac succumbs to the pressure and in the process enters into a huge conflict with Cam Rose. The two men struggle and Isaac collapses hitting his head really hard. He later dies in hospital after failing on life support. After the will is read, it turns out that the Isaac split the shares of Green & Green equally to four people; His granddaughter (daughter to Jake and his ex-wife Ava Green), his two sons and his ailing sister, who happens to be Cam Rose's ex-wife. The will distribution greatly affects Cam expectations, as a result he embarks on a mission to capture the easiest 25%, that is from his wife. However, the 25% assigned to his granddaughter are assigned to Ava her mother for custody. Jake continues trying to repay Lady Rah, however, in the meantime, Lady Rah's boss Peter appears. Apparently, Peter is blackmailing Lady Rah by kidnapping her daughter. Lady Rah is in the process of using all her savings to save her daughter's life and return to Sierra Leone. Peter becomes relentless with Cam promises that he will use his supposed 25% to capture the Green & Green business. As such, he kidnaps Ava Green to get an opportunity to blackmail Jake into giving him the company by force. The FBI advances their case based on the taped information from Cam's office. Jake eventually settles for more dynamic terms of doing business while freeing his ex-wife from Peter. In the season finale, Freddy bumps into Peters new office at the Greens and finds Jake negotiating further terms of their contract. Lady Rah storms in with her security men and shoots Peter's guards. At the end, Jake is standing in the middle of Peter and Lady Rah's guns, waiting for a shooting opportunity. Cast =Main= *Jeremy Sisto as Freddy Green *Cam Gigandet as Jake Green *Raymond J.

In July 1986, the Vancouver Park Board approved a fountain memorial to honor victims of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The memorials, which was created by Sam Carter, features a water-filled bronze cauldron on a granite base and an eternal flame. In 1992, Seaforth Park was renamed Seaforth Peace Park during a ceremony in which local students created a peace grove consisting of twelve Cercidiphyllum (katsura) trees on the south side of the park.

The Timpanogos people initially tolerated the presence of the settlers, and the two groups enjoyed some moments of mutual friendship. However, after three Mormons murdered a Timpanogos man called Old Bishop and a hard winter where Timpanogos took around 50 Mormon cattle, settlers in Fort Utah petitioned to go to war with the Timpanogos. Isaac Higbee, Parley P. Pratt and Willard Richards convinced Brigham Young to exterminate any Timpanogos hostile to the Mormon settlement. Young sent the Nauvoo Legion down with Captain George D. Grant and later sent General Daniel H. Wells to lead the army. After the Timpanogos defended themselves from their village and an abandoned cabin, they fled their camp. The Mormons pursued the Timpanogos from Chief Old Elk's tribe and any other Timpanogos they found in the valley, killing Timpanogos from Chief Pareyarts or Para-yah (Old Elk)'s tribe and other tribes even if they had no history of attacking the Mormons. The Nauvoo Legion killed around 100 Timpanogos. Buildup =Mormon settlers kill renegade Timpanogos at Battle Creek= Around February 1849, Dimick B. Huntington spoke with Timpanogos leader Little Chief about some of the settlers' missing cattle. Little Chief said that Roman Nose and Blue Shirt were great thieves who had decided to live off of the settlers' cattle all winter. Little Chief said that the Mormons should kill these renegades, perhaps out of fear that his tribe would be blamed and killed for the missing cattle. Captain John Scott took fifty men into Utah Valley to put a \\"final end\\" to the \\"depredations.\\". On March 3, 1849, Scott's men made their way down the Provo river and asked Little Chief and his camp about where the renegades were. Little Chief's tribe was understandably worried about the fifty armed men, and Little Chief agreed to show Scott where the renegades were. Little Chief's two sons guided Scott's men to the renegade's camp near Battle Creek Canyon. Scott's men surrounded the camp, which consisted of several men and their families. The renegades refused to talk and opened fire on the company, even though they were considerably weaker. Scott's men dropped rocks on the renegades in the creek, which caused the women and children to surrender. Pareyarts and Opecarry (aka Stick-in-the-Head), leaders of local Timpanogos tribes, watched the settlers \\"relentlessly shoot down\\" the remaining Timpanogos. This contributed to their later mistrust of the settlers during the events preceding the Battle at Fort Utah. Illustration of Fort Utah in 1850 =Initial Mormon settlement= On March 10, 1849, Brigham Young assigned 30 families to settle Utah Valley, with John S. Higbee as president and translator Dimick B. Huntington and Isaac Higbee as counselors. They headed towards Timpanogos territory with 30 families or 150 people. It is likely that the settlers arrived on April 1 and began construction of the fort on April 3. The Timpanogos viewed this as an invasion of their territory and sacred land. As the settlers came in, they were actively blocked by a group of Timpanogos led by An-kar-tewets with warnings that trespassing would be met with death and destruction. D. Robert Carter suggests that An-kar-tewets was probably demanding a tribute for the travels of the caravan through their territory. Later, a Timpanogos chief met with Huntington, possibly Black Elk. Huntington said that the settlement would be beneficial for the Timpanogos. The chief consented to let the Mormons settle there after Huntington rose his hand and swore by the sun god that they would not try to drive the Timpanogos off their lands or take away their rights. The settlers built a stockade called Fort Utah and armed it with a twelve-pound cannon to intimidate the Timpanogos. They also built several log houses, surrounded by a palisade 20 by 40 rods in size (), with gates in the east and west ends, and a middle deck for the cannon. The surrounding land was divided into 58, lots. Fort Utah in 1849 Relations between the two groups started familiarly, with Mormons and Timpanogos fishing and gambling together. Brigham Young disapproved of their familiarity with one another and advised Huntington and Alexander Williams to be the sole traders. Parley P. Pratt visited and made rules against gambling with the Timpanogos and against shooting near the fort. The fort was built on the sacred grounds for the annual fish festival and very close to the main Timpanogos village on the Provo River. The settlers fenced off pastures. Their cattle would eat and trample the seeds and berries that were an important part of the Timpanogos diet. They used gill nets to catch fish, which didn't leave any fish for the Timpanogos to eat. With the traditional sources of food gone, they soon experienced massive starvation. The settlers also brought measles, which was foreign to the Timpanogos, and they began dying in large numbers. =Old Bishop's murder= In August, a Timpanog named Old Bishop was murdered by Rufus Stoddard, Richard Ivie, and Gerome Zabrisky over a shirt they wanted from him. Another account from Thomas Orr states that the Timpanogos agreed not to take the settlers' cattle if they would not kill their wild game. Old Bishop discovered the men hunting deer, expressed his displeasure, and the men killed him. They filled his body with rocks and threw it in the Provo River. The men went back to Fort Utah and openly bragged about the murder.S JH, January 31, 1850; HBY, 1850:17‚Äì18. The HBY account reads: \\"Statement made by Elder James Bean (June 12, 1854). \\"Jerome Zobriski, Richard A. Ivie, and John Rufus Stoddard were going out from the fort in Utah Valley, professedly to hunt cattle; shortly they met an Indian who was wearing a shirt which R. A. Ivie claimed, alleging that it had been stolen from him and demanded it; the Indian refused to give it up, saying he had bought it; whereupon they tried to take it from him forcibly, he struggling all the time against them to defend himself drew his bow, when John R. Stoddard shot him through the head killing him instantly; they then dragged his corpse to the Provo River and sunk it near the Box Elder Island... James Bean heard Ivie relate the occurrence. Zobriski and Stoddard have boasted of it. Elder Tames Goff subsequently stated that the murder of the Indian was talked of at the time by many of the settlers. The Timpanogos found the body and discovered that Richard Ivie was involved in the murder. The Timpanogos were angry, and demanded that the murderers be handed over, to which the settlers refused. The Timpanogos asked for material compensation for Old Bishop's death according to Timpanogos custom, which the settlers also refused, which enraged the Timpanogos, given how they were sharing prime pasture and fishing land. Some Timpanogos shot at cattle that were trespassing on their land or took the settlers' corn in response. Drawing of Pareyarts aka Old Elk and his wife. In October, apostle Charles C. Rich negotiated a peace treaty, and Brigham Young again advised Fort Utah not to hold the Timpanogos as equals, but to \\"have dominion\\" over them. Winter was especially hard and Timpanogos took 5060 cattle for food. Travelling forty-niners traded with the Timpanogos, giving them more guns and ammunition. Williams kicked Pareyarts out of Mrs. Hunt's house after he asked for some medicine for measles, and later, three of Mrs. Hunt's cattle were missing.S JH, January 31, 1850; HBY, 1850:17‚Äì18. \\"Statement made by Elder James Bean (June 12, 1854). The settlers in Utah Ft. then made a law to keep all Indians out of the fort. Pareyarts who was sick with the measles came in for some medicine went to Sister Hunt's house where Alexander Williams saw him and took him by the nape of the neck and kicked him out of the fort. That same evening the Indians stole three cows out of Mrs. Hunt's yard and continued stealing, which was the commencement of Indian difficulties. By January 1850, settlers of Fort Utah reported to officials in Salt Lake City that the situation was getting dangerous. They wanted a military party to attack the Timpanogos. Not knowing the story of Old Bishop's murder, Brigham Young noted that a white man wouldn't be murdered over stealing an item like a shirt or ox, and said that the Timpanogos shouldn't be killed over theft. =Mormon decision to go to war= On January 31, 1850, Isaac Higbee, who had replaced John Higbee as bishop of Fort Utah, met with Governor Brigham Young, militia leader General Daniel H. Wells and the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to petition Young for a war order. He stated that all the occupants of Fort Utah were in agreement that they should go to war. Apostles Parley P. Pratt and Willard Richards argued for the killing of the Timpanogos, since losing Fort Utah would cut off communication to the southern colonies. Brigham Young also was concerned losing Fort Utah would disrupt his plans to have a route to California and occupy every fertile valley. Brigham Young ordered an extermination campaign against the Timpanogos, with orders to kill all the Timpanogos men, but save the women and children who behaved. General Wells drafted the extermination order as Special Order No. 2 and sent them to Captain George D. Grant. In his letter, he told Grant \\"Take no hostile Indians as prisoners\\" and \\"let none escape but do the work up clean\\". On February 1, Brigham Young met with Captain Howard Stansbury of the U.S. Topographical engineers who was in Utah mapping Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake. Stansbury had also been a victim of cattle theft and supported Young's decision to go to war with supplies and the services of his physician. On February 2, Brigham Young announced his decision to the general assembly. General Wells called for volunteers. On February 4, Captain Grant headed towards Fort Utah, followed shortly by Major Andrew Lytle. Battle Squaw Peak was named after Big Elk's wife who died trying to escape the Mormon militia The Timpanogos had fortified their village with barricades made from stacked logs and fallen timber. The fortifications housed seventy warriors and their families. The Timpanogos were headed by Pareyarts, who was sick from the measles. Some Timpanogos who were friends with some of the settlers sought shelter in Fort Utah before the battle, including Antonga, whom the Mormons called \\"Black Hawk.\\" The Nauvoo Legion was sent from Salt Lake City and on February 8, they engaged the Timpanogos in battle. Their initial strategy was to encircle the Timpanogos village and kill all hostile Timpanogos. The Timpanogos fortified themselves in an abandoned cabin, and the first day ended in a stalemate. Pareyarts's braves were probably joined by warriors from villages on the Spanish Fork river and Peteetneet Creek. The next day, the soldiers mounted shields on sledges and the defending Timpanogos suffered about ten casualties and Chief Opecarry was wounded. Joseph Higbee, son of Isaac Higbee, was the only casualty of the Mormons. The Timpanogos fled during the night after the second day of fighting. They split into two groups. Pareyarts took a small group of wounded and sick and fled to Rock Canyon. Opecarry took the rest of the Timpanogos towards the Spanish Fork River. Black Hawk reported to the settlers that the village was deserted the next morning; about eight bodies were found in the camp, killed possibly by exposure to the cold or shots from Nauvoo Legion. After having received a letter about the poor attitude of the settlers in working with Wells's troops, Brigham Young sent Wells to lead the army with the expanded mission \\"not to leave the valley until every Indian was out.\\" On February 11, Wells split the army into two. One contingent, under Captain Grant's command, followed the trail of some Timpanogos who had fled up Rock Canyon; Black Hawk helped the militia to track the fleeing Timpanogos. They set up camp at the mouth of the canyon, where they took 23 prisoners and found about a dozen dead bodies, including the body of Pareyarts. Further up the canyon, they found more tepees and killed more Timpanogos and took more prisoners. Some of the prisoners were later executed. Ope-carry, Patsowet, and their families: six women and seven children, managed to flee over the mountains using snowshoes they made in the canyon. According to Edward Tullidge, Pareyarts's young, beautiful, and intelligent wife was found dead in Rock Canyon. One account says that one of the Timpanogos women killed herself by falling from a precipice. It is possible that the woman was Pareyarts's wife, and local legends say that Squaw Peak was named for her. The other contingent, led by Wells, divided into smaller parties and searched the southern valley for Timpanogos to kill. They first attacked a village along the Spanish Fork River, and then a village on Peteetneet Creek. On February 13, 15‚Äì20 Timpanogos families surrendered to Captain Grant in modern-day Lake Shore, Utah. Wells wrote a letter to Brigham Young asking what he should do. On February 14, Brigham Young wrote a letter instructing Wells to kill them if they did not surrender.See footnote in Lieutenant Gunnison of the Stansbury Expedition reported that the Mormons promised to be friendly to the Timpanogos men. They held them prisoner overnight; but then in the morning lined up the Timpanogos men to be executed in front of their families. Some attempted to flee across the frozen lake, but the Mormons ran after them on horseback and shot them. At least eleven Timpanogos men were killed; one account reports as many as twenty. The family members were then taken captive. Later in the day on February 14, the Nauvoo Legion spotted five more Timpanogos men on horseback, and killed three of them. On February 15, they killed three more Timpanogos men on the Peteetneet river, probably members of Chief Peteetneet's tribe. On February 17, they killed another Timpanogos person in Rock Canyon. In total, one militia man and an estimated 102 Timpanogos were killed. Aftermath A government surgeon, James Blake, went to the execution site and cut off the Timpanogos' heads for later examination. Captain Howard Stansbury wanted the heads for \\"future scientific study\\" and planned to take them to Washington. Around 50 decapitated Timpanogos heads were gathered. They were supposed to be shipped to Salt Lake, but they were held up to be displayed in front of the prisoners at Fort Utah as a warning. The prisoners, including those who sought shelter in the fort before the war, were left in the cold under the fort's canyon, some of whom were dying from exposure. William Potter, who was upset at the condition, petitioned for blankets for the prisoners, which was eventually given. More than forty prisoners, mostly women and children, were taken to Salt Lake and placed with Mormon families \\"as servants\\" in Salt Lake City \\"for the purpose of weaning them from their savage pursuits, and bringing them up in the habits of civilized and Christian life\\". It did not go as planned, as many died and most escaped to live with other Ute bands, especially in the spring. News of the enslavement reached the US Government, and became one of the first priorities of Edward Cooper after he was appointed as Indian Agent of Utah later that year. Chief Peteetneet, Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah and Chief Grospean discovered the decapitated bodies and asked Fort Utah about the bodies. Patsowet returned to the Salt Lake area and killed livestock belonging to Mormons in retaliation for the violence done to his tribe and threatened to kill Walkara's animals. Patsowet was tried for the murder of the one casualty of the Mormon militia at Fort Utah, and was arrested, tried, and executed.

People born in these circumstances tend to have a mix of characteristics common to their adjacent generations, but do not closely resemble those born in the middle of their adjacent generations.{{cite journal |last=Giancola |first=Frank |title=The generation gap: more myth than reality |journal=Human Resource Planning |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=32‚Äì7 |date=2006 |issn=0199-8986 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/24173545/generation-gap-more- myth-than-reality}  Background  Generational profiles are built based on people born in the middle of a generation rather than those on the tails of a generation. Generations may overlap by five to eight years. As such, many people identify with aspects of at least two generations. The precise birth years defining when generations start and end vary.  Notable cusper groups  =Greatest Generation/Silent Generation= Date ranges *Just before the 1920s, as identified by Graeme Codrington. Characteristics These cuspers experienced the lows after World War I but also the highs of the early Roaring Twenties, the Flappers, the Charleston and early silent movies. As these cuspers came of age, some of them become more visionary like the Greatest Generation or stoic like the Silents. =Silent Generation/Baby Boomers= Date ranges *1933-1945 as identified by Susan Mitchell *1939-1945 as identified by Claire Raines Associates *1940-1945 as identified by Lancaster and Stillman, authors of When Generations Collide as well as The Mayo Clinic *1943-1948 as identified by Deon Smit writing for HR Future Characteristics Claire Raines Associates names these cuspers the Sandwich Group. Susan Mitchell calls these cuspers the Swing Generation. According to the Mayo Clinic, these cuspers have the work ethic of the Silent Generations, but like Baby Boomers will often challenge the status quo. Codrington describes them as having the status-seeking, career advancement motivations as Baby Boomers. Codrington adds that they are old enough to remember World War II, but were born too late to enjoy the 1960s. Hart notes that research has found the younger members of the Silent Generation tended to share more traits with Baby Boomers. Writer Marian Botsford Fraser described women in this cusper population as girls who \\"...did not smoke dope at high school, go to rock concerts, toy with acid and the pill and hippie boyfriends at university or tour Europe with a backpack.\\" Instead, she notes \\"These girls wore crinolines and girdles, went to The Prom, went to nursing school and teachers' college, rarely university.\\" Speaking of Susan Mitchell's population specifically they are believed to be an anomaly in that they tend be more activist and free thinkers than those born prior to them in the Silent Generation. Lancaster and Stillman echo this last point and note that these cuspers were on the frontlines of America's internal struggles as adults, agitating in favor of human rights. They go on to say many women among these cuspers entered in to male-dominated workplaces before the women's movement existed, blazing a trail for other generations of women to follow.  Famous members  * Former South African president Thabo Mbeki * Britain's former prime minister Gordon Brown =Baby Boomers/Generation X= Date ranges *1954-1965 as identified by Jonathan Pontell *1958-1967 as identified by Mark Wegierski of the Hudson Institute. *1960-1965 as identified by Lancaster and Stillman, Mayo Clinic and Andrea Stone writing in USA Today *1962-1967 as identified by Smit. *1964-1969 as identified by Codrington. Characteristics This population is sometimes referred to as Generation Jones, and less commonly as Tweeners. These cuspers were not as financially successful as older Baby Boomers. They experienced a recession like many Generation Xers but had a much more difficult time finding jobs than Generation X did. While they learned to be IT-savvy, they didn't have computers until after high school but were some of the first to purchase them for their homes. They were among some of the first to take an interest in video games. They get along well with Baby Boomers, but share different values. While they are comfortable in office environments, they are more relaxed at home. They're less interested in advancing their careers than Baby Boomers and more interested in quality of life. =Generation X/Millennials= Date ranges * 1977-1981 as identified by Doree Shafrir writing for Slate * 1977-1983 as identified by Smit and Merriam-Webster * 1977-1985 as identified by Business Insider Characteristics The Generation X/Millennial cuspers are most commonly referred to as Xennials, although other names include The Oregon Trail Generation, Generation Catalano and The Lucky Ones. Researchers point out that these cuspers have both the healthy skepticism of Generation X and the optimism of Millennials. They are likely to challenge authority, but also are more career-focused than Generation X. While not all of these cuspers are digital natives, they are very comfortable with technology. =Millennials/Generation Z= Date ranges * 1993-1998 as identified by Smit. and Vice Media. Characteristics Referred to as MinionZ by Smit and most commonly referred to as \\"Zillennials\\" these cuspers came of age around the introduction of smartphones and rise of social media. This group of people were also born during the mid-to late 90's when the annual birthrates of Millennials (echo-boomers) decreased starting in 1994. Hitting its highest negative change in 1998, and then slowing back down in 1999. Zillennials are often the children of Generation Jones.  Workplace importance  Communication misunderstandings between employees of different generations are detrimental to workplace morale, increasing turnover and absenteeism while decreasing job satisfaction, work commitment and productivity. Effective communication between employees of different generations, however, allows for collaborative relationships and ensures that information is retained from one generation to the next. Cuspers play an important role in multi-generational workplaces and other organizations. Metaphorically cuspers are like bridges or glue that connect members of their adjacent major generations. Between generations, they are naturally skilled at mediating, translating, mentoring and managing. Strategically placing cuspers in the workplace has the potential to reduce generational workplace friction and give organizations doing so a competitive advantage.  Generational identity  Many cuspers don't feel a sense of belonging to a specific generation. Researchers studying generational subculture theory have speculated that there may be populations within larger generational cohorts whose values are more in line with those of preceding generations, for example, someone born in the range of Generation X who has a moral philosophy more similar to the Silent Generation. The generational fuzziness theory purposes that one's generation is best defined as the combination of one's birth year and generational identity‚Äîthe cultural generation to feel most similar to.

A large fleet commanded by Servius Fulvius Paetinus Nobilior and Marcus Aemilius Paullus successfully evacuated the remnants of the expedition, defeating a Carthaginian fleet en route, but was struck by a storm while returning, losing most of its ships. The Romans had invaded the Carthaginian homeland (in what is now north eastern Tunisia) in 256 BC. After initial successes they had left a force of 15,500 men to hold their lodgement over the winter. This force, under Marcus Atilius Regulus, was decisively beaten at the Battle of Tunis in the spring of 255 BC and Regulus captured. 2,000 survivors were besieged in the port of Aspis. The Roman fleet of 390 warships was sent to rescue and evacuate them. A Carthaginian fleet of 200 ships intercepted them off Cape Hermaeum (the modern Cape Bon or ), north of Aspis. The Carthaginians were defeated with 114 of their ships captured, together with their crews, and 16 sunk. What losses the Romans suffered, if any, is not known; most modern historians assume there were none. The Romans landed in Aspis, sortied, dispersed the besiegers and raided the surrounding country for food. All then re-embarked and left for Italy. Off the south-east corner of Sicily, a sudden summer storm blew up and devastated the Roman fleet. From their total of 464 of warships, 384 were sunk, as were 300 transports; and more than 100,000 men were lost. Despite the heavy losses of both sides, the war continued for a further 14 years, mostly on Sicily or the nearby waters, before ending with a Roman victory. Primary sources The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( ‚Äì 118 BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is known today for The Histories, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of Cape Hermaeum. Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the forty comprising The Histories deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are largely based on interpretations of Polybius's account. The modern historian Andrew Curry has stated that \\"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\\"; while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\\". Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states \\"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\\". Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme Olympias. Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the site of the Battle of the Aegates, the final battle of the war, fought fourteen years later. Their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing. Background =Operations in Sicily= In 264 BC, the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River Arno had recently been unified under Roman control. According to the classicist Richard Miles, Rome's expansionary attitude after southern Italy came under its control combined with Carthage's proprietary approach to Sicily caused the two powers to stumble into war more by accident than design. The immediate cause of the war was the issue of control of the independent Sicilian city state of Messana (modern Messina). =Ships= During this period the standard Mediterranean warship was the quinquereme, meaning \\"five-rowers\\". The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around 100 tonnes (110 short tons; 100 long tons). The modern expert on galleys John Coates suggests they could maintain 7 knots (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods. The modern replica galley Olympias has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at for hours on end. Average speeds of 5‚Äì6 knots (6‚Äì7 mph; 9‚Äì11 km/h) were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week. Vessels were built as cataphract, or \\"protected\\", ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and catapults. They had a separate \\"oar box\\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers. The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets ‚Äì or files ‚Äì of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total. The Romans had little naval experience prior to the First Punic War; on the few occasions they had previously needed a naval presence they had usually relied on small squadrons provided by their Latin or Greek allies. In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and thus slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, although hexaremes (six oarsmen per bank), quadriremes (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are occasionally mentioned in the sources. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \\"warship\\" in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers. It would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines; if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120. Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. At least half of the oarsmen needed to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. All of the rams recovered by modern archeologists were made individually by the lost-wax method to fit immovably to a galley's prow, and secured with bronze spikes. Ideally one would attack an enemy ship from its side or rear, thus avoiding the possibility of being rammed oneself. Skill was required to impact an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one's own galley in the stricken enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship on ship combats which have been likened to aerial dogfights. Invasion of Africa Largely because of the Romans' invention of the , a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at Mylae (260 BC) and Sulci (257 BC). Encouraged by these and frustrated at the continuing stalemate in Sicily, the Romans changed their focus to a sea-based strategy and developed a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten Carthage (close to Tunis). Both sides were determined to establish naval supremacy and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies. The Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transport ships sailed from Ostia, the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, commanded by the consuls for the year, Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus. They embarked approximately 26,000 picked legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily. They planned to cross to Africa and invade what is now Tunisia. The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under Hanno and Hamilcar, off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. A combined total of about 680 warships carrying up to 290,000 crew and marines met in the Battle of Cape Ecnomus. The Carthaginians took the initiative, anticipating that their superior ship-handling skills would tell. After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians were defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk. thumb|upright=1|left|alt=a map of what is now north-east Tunisia, showing the advance, main military clashes and retreat of the invading Roman army in 256‚Äì255 BC|1: Romans land and capture Aspis (256 BC) 2: Roman victory at Adys (256 BC) 3: Romans capture Tunis (256 BC) 4: Xanthippus sets out from Carthage with a large army (255 BC) 5: Romans are defeated at the Battle of Tunis. (255 BC) 6: Romans retreat to Aspis and leave Africa. (255 BC) As a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Regulus, landed in Africa near Aspis (modern Kelibia) and captured it. Most of the Roman ships returned to Sicily, leaving Regulus with 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to continue the war in Africa. Regulus advanced on the city of Adys and besieged it. The Carthaginians, meanwhile, had recalled Hamilcar from Sicily with 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Hamilcar, Hasdrubal and Bostar were placed in joint command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans'. The Romans carried out a night march and launched a surprise dawn attack on the Carthaginian camp from two directions. After confused fighting the Carthaginians broke and fled. Roman reversal and withdrawal =Battle of Tunis= The Romans followed up and captured Tunis, only from Carthage. In despair, the Carthaginians sued for peace, but Regulus's proposed terms were so harsh the Carthaginians decided to fight on. They gave charge of the training of their army to the Spartan mercenary commander Xanthippus. In the spring of 255 BC Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 war elephants against the Romans' infantry-based army at the Battle of Tunis. The Romans had no effective answer to the elephants, their outnumbered cavalry were chased from the field and the Carthaginian cavalry then surrounded most of the Romans and decisively defeated them. Most of the Romans were killed, while approximately 500, including Regulus, were captured; another 2,000 Romans escaped and retreated to Aspis which was situated on a high and naturally strong position, and overlooked the natural harbour of the Bay of Clupea. Xanthippus, fearful of the envy of the Carthaginian generals he had outdone, took his pay and returned to Greece. =Battle of Cape Hermaeum= Later in 255 BC the Romans sent a fleet of 350 quinqueremes and more than 300 transports to evacuate their survivors, who were under siege in Aspis. Both consuls for the year, Servius Fulvius Paetinus Nobilior and Marcus Aemilius Paullus, accompanied the fleet. They captured the island of Cossyra en route. The Carthaginians attempted to oppose the evacuation with 200 quinqueremes. They intercepted the Romans off Cape Hermaeum (the modern Cape Bon or ), a little to the north of Aspis. The 40 Roman ships which had been left to support Regulus's force over the winter sortied from Aspis to join the fight. Few details of the battle have survived. The Carthaginians were concerned they would be encircled by the larger Roman fleet, and so sailed close to the coast. However, the Carthaginian ships were outmanoeuvred and pinned against the coast, where many were boarded via the and captured, or forced to beach. The Carthaginians were defeated, and 114 of their ships were captured, together with their crews, and 16 sunk. What, if any, the Roman losses were is not known; most modern historians assume there were none. The historian Marc DeSantis suggests that a lack of soldiers serving as marines on the Carthaginian ships, compared with the Romans', may have been a factor in their defeat and in the large number of vessels captured. = Storm = The fleet docked at Aspis, where the Roman garrisonreinforced by the fleet's marinessortied, dispersed the besiegers and raided the surrounding country for food. All then re-embarked and left for Italy. They sailed directly to Sicily, making landfall at its south-west corner, then proceeded along the south coast. In mid-July, somewhere between the friendly city of Kamarina and Cape Passaro, the south-east corner of Sicily, a sudden summer storm blew up and devastated the Roman fleet. From their total of 464 of warships, 384 were sunk, as were 300 transports; and more than 100,000 men were lost. DeSantis considers 100,000 to be a conservative estimate while the historian Howard Scullard breaks the loss down as 25,000 soldiers, who would have included many of the survivors of Regulus's army; and 70,000 rowers and crew, with many of these probably being Carthaginians taken captive in the recent battle. The majority of the casualties are assumed to have been non-Roman Latin allies. It is possible that the presence of the made the Roman ships unusually unseaworthy; there is no record of them being used after this disaster. Polybius is critical of what he considers the poor judgement and seamanship displayed immediately prior to the storm. Both consuls survived, and despite the loss of most of their fleet, each was awarded a triumph in January 254 for their victory at Cape Hermaeum. As Scullard points out, this is a clear indication \\"the subsequent tragedy was regarded as due to natural causes rather than to bad seamanship\\". Aftermath Paullus built a column at his own expense on the Capitoline Hill in Rome celebrating the victory. In keeping with tradition he adorned it with the prows of captured Carthaginian ships. The column was destroyed by lightning in 172 BC. The war continued, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, adding 220 new ships, and captured Panormus (modern Palermo) in 254 BC. The next year they lost 150 ships to another storm. Slowly the Romans had occupied most of Sicily; in 249 BC they besieged the last two Carthaginian strongholdsin the extreme west. They also launched a surprise attack on the Carthaginian fleet, but were defeated at the Battle of Drepana. The Carthaginians followed up their victory and most of the remaining Roman warships were lost at the Battle of Phintias; the Romans were all but swept from the sea. It was to be seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet, while Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower. After several years of stalemate, the Romans rebuilt their fleet again in 243 BC and effectively blockaded the Carthaginian garrisons. Carthage assembled a fleet which attempted to relieve them, but it was destroyed at the Battle of the Aegates Islands in 241 BC, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to negotiate for peace. The terms offered to Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus. The question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and when Carthage besieged the Roman- protected town of Saguntum in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the Second Punic War with Rome.

In the House of Lords he was a Conservative. Early life When Poulett was born in 1827, his chance of inheriting the family estates seemed remote. He was the third son of Vice- Admiral the Hon. George Poulett RN (1786‚Äì1854), who was the second son of the 4th Earl and the brother of the 5th Earl, who already had three sons. His mother, Catherine Poulett, was a daughter of Sir George Dallas, 1st Baronet.Burke's Peerage, volume 2 (2003), p. 3203 He joined the 54th (West Norfolk) Regiment of Foot in 1840 and was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, passing out in 1842. Commissioned into the 54th Regiment, in 1846 he transferred to the 2nd Queen‚Äôs Royals, then from 1852 to 1857 was with the 22nd Regiment in India, taking part in the British expedition from Peshawar to the Boroe Valley in 1853, and was with Brigadier-General Boileau at the storming of the heights.\\"POULETT, 6th Earl\\", in Who Was Who, online edition by Oxford University Press, 2014, accessed 3 August 2016 (Subscription site) Inheritance In 1857, news reached Poulett in India that both surviving sons of his uncle the 5th Earl had died: Amias Poulett on 20 February 1857, and Vere Poulett, Viscount Hinton, on 29 August 1857. As Poulett's own father and older brothers had also died, this left him unexpectedly as the heir presumptive to the family estates, and he returned to England. From 1858 to 1870, he hunted the Hambledon Foxhounds six days a week. In 1864, as foreseen, he succeeded his uncle, the 5th Earl Poulett, inheriting Hinton House and about 11,000 acres, mostly around Hinton St George, with a second country house at Granville Hall, Droxford. He became a racehorse owner, specialising in National Hunt, and owned The Lamb, winner of the Grand National in 1868 and 1871. Another of his horses, Benazal, won twenty-seven steeple-chases and other races. In Who's Who, Poulett gave his recreations as \\"Racing, hunting, steeple-chasing, shooting, driving, yachting, fishing, telegraphy, and photography\\". He was a member of the Army and Navy Club, Arthur‚Äôs, the Wellington Club, the Royal Albert Yacht Club, the Royal London Yacht Club, and others. Personal life Poulett married three times. First, on 23 June 1849, Elizabeth Lavinia, daughter of Joseph Newman of Landport, a pilotThe Complete Peerage, vol. x p. 623; she died in 1871. Later that year he married, secondly, Emma Sophia Johnson, who died in 1876. Lastly, in 1879, he married Rosa, daughter of Alfred Hugh (de) Melville, an artistThe Complete Peerage, vol. x p. 624, and they had one son, William John Lydston Poulett, Viscount Hinton, born 11 September 1883, and two daughters, Eleanor Augusta Rosa, born 9 October 1879, and Violet Nita, born 5 October 1880. His daughter Lady Violet married Cecil John Talbot Rhys Wingfield and was the mother of Edward William Rhys Wingfield (1905‚Äì1984). A son, William Turnour Thomas Poulett, had been born to his first wife on 15 December 1849, at Southsea, Hampshire, only six months after their marriage, and Poulett had reason to believe he had been fathered by another man, Captain William Turnour Granville. In 1869, this son had married Lydia Ann Shippey, the daughter of William Shippey, a general dealer. They had one son, William Henry George Poulett (born 1 April 1870), and a daughter, Maud. In November 1871, W. T. T. Poulett petitioned the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes for a Declaration of Legitimacy, to establish that he was the lawful son of William Henry Poulett, now the 6th Earl. In 1875, he was living at the family's secondary estate, Grenville Hall, Droxford, under the courtesy title of Viscount Hinton.Thom Adam Bisset, The Upper Ten Thousand, for 1876: A Biographical Handbook (1876), p. 227: \\"Hinton, visc.

Poulett was again disowned. Dispute Following the 6th Earl's death, the Poulett earldom and its entailed estates were claimed by W. T. T. Poulett, and on 27 July 1903, on a report from its Committee of Privileges, the House of Lords determined the dispute in favour of the 6th Earl's fifteen- year-old son, William John Lydston Poulett.Poulett Peerage, outcome of House of Lords Debate on 27 July 1903 (vol 126, cc298-9) In a curious turn of events, Wilhelmina Powlett, Duchess of Cleveland, the widow of a distant kinsman of the 6th Earl Poulett, left W.

Ukrainian nationalists did not retreat with the Soviet forces, but instead saw an opportunity to support the independence of Ukraine through alliances with the Nazis.Volhynia Massacre, History. Retrieved August 16, 2016. Shortly following the German occupation, the Nazis permitted Ukrainians to loot Jewish assets over a three-day period. The Nazis also commandeered Jews as forced labour. After the looting by Ukrainians, the Jews of Sarny were forced to hand over most assets to the Nazis, with orders largely enforced by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, a volunteer organisation established by the Nazis.Zvi Pearlstein, The Ghetto- The Beginning of The End.

This was the first shooting which suspect Aaron Saucedo (see below) was originally charged. = 2016 = On January 1, 22-year-old Jesse Olivas was shot to death on a sidewalk at 2200 N. 58th Dr. On March 17, near 1100 E. Moreland St., a 16-year-old boy was shot and wounded while walking down the street at about 11:30 p.m. This was believed to be the first shooting during the original investigation. On March 18, at 11:30 p.m., a 21-year-old man was shot and wounded while standing outside his vehicle at 4300 N. 73rd Ave. On April 1, 21-year-old Diego Verdugo-Sanchez was shot and killed at around 9:00 p.m. while visiting his pregnant fianc√©e and her family. On the early morning of April 19, 55-year-old Krystal Annette White was found shot to death at 500 N. 32nd St. On June 1, at 9:50 p.m., 32-year-old Horacio Pena was shot to death outside his house at 6700 W. Flower St. after returning home from work. On June 10, at 9:30 p.m., 19-year-old Manuel Castro Garcia was killed outside his house. A police officer nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, but the killer had already fled. On June 12, at 2:35 a.m., the shooter opened fire on an unoccupied vehicle at 6200 W. Mariposa Drive. Approximately half an hour later, the shooter killed 33-year-old Stefanie Ellis and her 12-year-old daughter Maleah outside their home. Their 31-year-old friend Angela Linner was also shot; she initially survived, but died from her wounds three weeks later. On July 11, the shooter opened fire on a car occupied by a 21-year-old man and a four-year-old boy, but neither was injured.  Investigation  The murders of Verdugo-Sanchez, Pena, Garcia, and the triple homicide were linked together due to the fact that they all occurred in Maryvale and due to similarity in modus operandi. The other shootings were later connected based on M.O. and location as well, though the murder of White and the first shooting occurred outside of Maryvale. A suspect was described by witnesses as a lanky dark- haired man in his early 20s. He was also described as being under 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) tall and Latino. However, police have not been able to rule out the possibility of multiple people being involved in the killings, as a car possibly containing more than one person was seen leaving the scene of two of the shootings, and three gunmen were reported by witnesses to have carried out the killings of the Ellises and Linner. However, police have stated that it is \\"unlikely\\" multiple people are involved in the killings. The suspect is believed to be using multiple vehicles, including a black BMW 5 Series and a white Cadillac or Lincoln. A composite sketch of the shooter was released by authorities on August 3. On October 19, 2016, police released recordings of 9-1-1 calls related to the case in an attempt to stir up more leads for the case. In December 2016, they said they had no active leads in regards to the investigation. = Psychological profile = FBI criminal profiler Brad Garrett believed that the shooter is a \\"thrill killer\\" and is seeking \\"intimacy\\" in the attacks as he shoots the victim from close range. Garrett also believed that the shooter is likely inserting himself in the investigation or attending police-community meetings about the killings. = 2017 developments = Frank Taylor The Phoenix Police Department commented publicly in March 2017 that Frank Taylor was a potential suspect in the shootings. He was killed after attempting to rob a woman at gunpoint a few weeks after the last known shooting; the would-be victim fatally shot him with her own gun, which she carried in a holster on her hip. After his death, Taylor was identified by several people as a potential suspect.  Aaron Saucedo  On April 22, 2017, a \\"person of interest\\" (POI) in the case was taken into custody on unrelated charges. The 21-year-old man who was targeted in the final known shooting had been shown a line-up of six potential suspects, one of whom was the POI later taken into custody. The POI was identified two days later as 23-year-old Aaron Saucedo, who had initially been arrested for the 2015 murder of 61-year-old Raul Romero, who was a friend of his mother. A 9mm Hi-Point pistol owned by Saucedo was confirmed, through ballistics, to be the same weapon that killed Romero. Saucedo also owned a black BMW 5 Series sedan, the same type of car that the shooter was reported to have been driving, and bore a resemblance to the composite sketch of the shooter released by police. Raul Romero was shot to death with the same type of weapon used in the Phoenix freeway shootings, a similar crime spree in 2015. However, the Arizona Department of Public Safety denied Saucedo had any link to those shootings, and that they still considered another man as a suspect. Police said there was no evidence to link Saucedo with those shootings as well. Saucedo was arraigned for the murders on May 8. Initially, he was only charged with the murder of Raul Romero. However, on June 30, he received an additional eight counts of first-degree murder, six counts of committing a drive-by shooting, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of endangerment and discharging a firearm at a structure. On July 6, Saucedo pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. His court appearances were frequently postponed, with the latest scheduled date being November 29, 2017. His trial is now scheduled for 2021.https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/investigations/new-lead- prosecutor-named-in-serial-street-shooter-case  See also  * Serial Shooter, a serial killer duo in Phoenix in 2005‚Äì2006 who had a similar M.O.

Six people were stabbed, one fatally, before a suspect, identified as Zakaria Bulhan, was apprehended by police and charged with murder and attempted murder. The media initially linked the stabbing to terrorism, but later shifted its focus to possible mental disorders. Events London's Metropolitan Police Service and London Ambulance Service arrived at the scene of the attacks six minutes after emergency services were called at 22:33. Less than ten minutes later, a man was arrested at the scene after being tasered by police. =Victims= Six people, apparently selected at random, were stabbed. A 64-year-old American, Darlene Horton, died at the scene. She had planned to fly back to Florida the following day. An American man, a British man, an Australian man, an Australian woman, and an Israeli woman were injured. The British man, Bernard Hepplewhite, underwent emergency surgery for a serious abdominal wound and remained in hospital for several days. Suspect Zakaria Bulhan was a 19-year-old male Norwegian national of Somali descent. He was described as a Muslim who \\"didn't really talk about religion.\\" He moved from Norway in 2002, and was unemployed and living with his mother and younger brother in Tooting, South London. Not long before the stabbing, Bulhan completed his first studies at South Thames College, and had been a patient at a psychiatric facility near Russell Square. According to a family friend, Bulhan called an ambulance three separate times in the last six months, claiming he wanted to harm himself. In his 2017 book, Media, Diaspora and the Somali Conflict, Idil Osman speculates that the \\"cultural stigma\\" associated with mental illness in Somali society makes it less likely that individuals and families of disturbed persons like Bulhan will seek treatment. =Legal proceedings= Following his arrest, Bulhan was treated in hospital and later held in custody at a police station in South London. On 5 August, he was charged with the murder of Horton, along with five counts of attempted murder. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 6 August, where he was remanded in custody. The trial was expected to take place in February 2017. In February 2017, Bulhan admitted killing US tourist Darlene Horton and injuring five others in Russell Square in 2016. He was sentenced on 7 February to be detained for an indefinite period in a maximum security hospital. =Investigation= The Metropolitan Police initially said they were exploring terrorism as a possible motive. They later said the investigation \\"increasingly points\\" to the attack being \\"triggered by mental health issues\\", and that the stabbings were random. Norwegian police cooperated in the investigation. Reactions In an interview after the attack, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said, \\"London is one of the safest capitals in the world\\". He added, \\"It is a reality in 2016 ‚Äì especially when you look at what happened in Nice, in Brussels, in Munich, in parts of America ‚Äì we've always got to be vigilant and never complacent.\\" Kenan Malik described the attack as highlighting \\"the difficulty... in drawing a distinction between jihadi violence and the fury of disturbed minds.\\" See also *2015 Leytonstone tube station attack References 2016 crimes in the United Kingdom 2016 in London August 2016 crimes in Europe August 2016 events in the United Kingdom Bloomsbury Crime in London Mass stabbings in the United Kingdom Stabbing attacks in 2016 Knife attacks ","title":"2016 Russell Square stabbing"},{"id":"51241266","text":"San Clemente al Volmano, also known as the Abbey of San Clemente is a Romanesque-style, former-Benedictine church and monastery found in a rural site, on a hill above the Volmano River, in the frazione of Guardia Vomano of the town of Notaresco, in provincia di Teramo, Abruzzo, Italy. History The abbey was founded by the Benedictines, putatively in 874. According to the Chronicon Casauriense (1182) is that while emperor Ludovico II himself commissioned the Casauria abbey after his release from the imprisonment by Adelchis of Benevento. Louis endowed that abbey with relics of the former Pope Clement I. Louis' mother Ermengarde of Tours, who was taking shelter at the nearby castle of Guardia, also provided for the founding of this abbey.

Rebuilt, the monastery was again razed by the Normans in 1077. As usual after the arson of church in this age, the relics of St Clement were discovered under the pavement of the church at the time of Abbot Grimoaldo (1096), and this encouraged again rebuilding of the monastery.

Merrin graduated from the University of Toledo with a Bachelor's of Arts, and subsequently Bowling Green State University with a Master's in Arts. In 2012 he was named 'Thirty Conservatives Under Thirty' by Red Alert Politics. Ohio House of Representatives With Representative Barbara Sears term-limited in 2016, Merrin entered the race to succeed her. He would go on to win a three-way primary against Republicans Vicki Donovan-Lyle and Kevin Haddad with over 45% of the vote. A Republican leaning district, Merrin nonetheless would have faced Democrat Lauri Cooper in the 2016 general election. Merrin received the opportunity to enter office early when Sears resigned from the seat to take a position in the administration of Ohio Governor John Kasich. As the winner of the Republican primary, Ohio House Republicans led by Speaker of the House Cliff Rosenberger appointed Merrin to serve the remainder of Sears' term. He was sworn into office on August 2, 2016.

It was released on Netflix on June 23, 2017.  Plot  Tyler is a high school student in love with his girlfriend Alison (\\"Ali\\"). One night at a party, Tyler discovers that Ali used to be a heavy partier and would often drink and sleep around. Tyler gets angry and the couple break up. Outside the party, he meets the mysterious Holly. They end up partying and sleeping together. They spend the rest of the weekend bonding and making love in Holly's huge house, with Holly telling Tyler her father died and her stepmother travels a lot. Tyler says that the weekend was special before leaving, seemingly forgetting all about Ali. Tyler gets back together with Ali the following day and, while at school, notices Holly. Holly reveals that she goes there now and wanted to surprise him. Tyler tries cutting ties with Holly multiple times but he fails each time. Holly starts hanging out with Ali, as well as Ali and Tyler's friends, Gil and Lydia. Lydia soon becomes suspicious of Holly when she discovers Holly's lack of any social media presence. Some time passes and Tyler begins to suspect that Holly is dangerous, especially when meeting her stepmom, Corinne, who reveals that Holly takes medication for a mental disorder. The next day, Holly intentionally causes Lydia to have an extreme allergic reaction after overhearing her telling Ali that she doesn't buy Holly's story and is going to find out what's going on. Holly later shows up at Tyler's house, telling him that she wants the two of them to get back together. When Tyler rebukes her, Holly tells Ali that she and Tyler slept together. Tyler and Ali meet at the beach, where he confesses everything to her. Ali states that she never wants to talk to him again, before leaving. Holly then proceeds to get Tyler suspended, saying that he assaulted her. While on suspension, Tyler finds out that Holly's real first name is Elizabeth, and then looks her up online and discovers that she violently assaulted another female student over a boy and was committed to a mental institution for a while as a result. That night, Holly kidnaps Ali and then lures Tyler to her house by sending him a picture of an unconscious Ali. Meanwhile, Ali awakens to discover that she has been tied up and bound to a chair in Holly's house. Corinne comes home and finds Ali and attempts to rescue her. However, Holly sneaks up behind Corinne and suffocates her with a plastic bag, killing her. When Tyler arrives at Holly's house, he discovers Ali unconscious. Ali has been tied mid-air to the ceiling, forehead bleeding. Tyler manages to free Ali, and the two escape outside. Before they can get away, Holly stops them at gunpoint. Holly shoots Tyler in the shoulder and then Ali picks up the fire poker, which Tyler had dropped when the two were confronted by Holly, and stabs Holly. Later, Holly, still alive, is wheeled into the back of an ambulance and asks the paramedic man to never leave her and makes him promise.

The amphitheater offers both regular seating as well as lawn seating. Since its opening, it has earned a national reputation as a premier contemporary amphitheater. History In 2009, the $15 million Bluestem Center for the Arts opened after a collaboration from the City of Moorhead, Fargo School District, and the State of Minnesota. The Fargo School District owns the buildings on the site, while the City of Moorhead owns the land. The need for Bluestem Center for the Arts arose due to continuous flooding at the previous home for Trollwood Performing Arts School at Trollwood Park in North Fargo. The communities welcomed the center, however a few short years later the center experienced financial hardships. The original non-profit was no longer able to make payments and the Fargo School District took over the amphitheater and approximately $5 million worth of debt. Though the center has not yet produced a profit, it is on track to do so in the near future. In 2014, the amphitheater set a new attendance record of 3,200 spectators for a concert featuring the Goo Goo Dolls Programs The amphitheater is used and managed by the Trollwood Performing Arts School as their main home. Trollwood offers performing arts classes to kids of all ages. Local concert promoters also draw national acts including: Wilco, Weezer, Goo Goo Dolls, and The Fray.

From 1915, the small town South of the lake, called \\"Lac-Fronti√®re\\" (English: Lake- Frontier), has had some development through the terminus of the Central Quebec railway. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the forest industry was the main economic activity of the region. Upon arrival of the railroad, the recreational and tourist vocation of the region has significantly developed.  Geography  Frontier lake supplies water by its tributary the Northwest Black River (from the North) and the Creek Reservoir (from the West). The village in the municipality of Lac-Fronti√®re, Quebec is located at South of the lake. The mouth of Frontier Lake is located on Southeast bank of the lake at: * West of the Canada-US border; * North of the village center of Lac- Fronti√®re, Quebec; * East of the summit of the \\"Montagne du Lac\\" (Mountain of the Lake) (elevation: ); * Southeast from the village of Sainte-Lucie-de- Beauregard, Quebec. Toponymy The choice of this place name is explained by its proximity to the US border. Established in 1842, this border in the Treaty of Webster-Ashburton, after lengthy negotiations between the British and the Americans. Subsequently, the British set up camp on the banks of the lake, to accommodate their surveyors who went to topographic surveys in order to determine more precisely the border. At the same time, the inhabitants of the region of Montmagny had designated this expanse of water \\"English Lake\\", by associating it with the language of people who were there, both British Americans.

Dewmobile, Inc. initially conceived Kuai Ya in Silicon Valley, California, USA to target the Chinese market in 2012. However, the demand for the application spread to neighboring countries such as Myanmar and Pakistan. When the international user base grew to a reasonable size, Dewmobile created a separate app known as Zapya to publish on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Awhile Kuai Ya and Zapya are similar to each other, they include different APK and features in order to comply with Google Play Policies. Zapya gained popularity in countries with low Internet penetration and poor Internet architecture because it allows users to share files without relying on an Internet or cellular data connection. The app is available on multiple platforms, including lower end phone models so that it is accessible to everyone. Users can transfer files of any kind and any size for free using a transfer method similar to Bluetooth and AirDrop. Some cellphone stores use Zapya's \\"Phone Replicate\\" feature to transfer the data from their customer's old phones to their new ones. Impact Zapya has become ingrained into the Cuban Youth culture due to the limited Wi-Fi access in Cuba. The Miami Herald reported on 11 July 2015 on how Cuban tech start-ups use Zapya to overcome the lack of internet penetration and poor Internet architecture in Cuba. They also found that the youth of Cuba use Zapya as a free platform to talk with their friends and share funny videos and photos with each other. The popularity of Zapya in Cuba has only grown stronger over the years to the point that Cubans have coined the verb \\"zapyar\\" as a slang term to refer to sharing files. Cachivache Media deemed Zapya as \\"the network for the disconnected\\" in 2016. Travelers and students planning to study abroad in Cuba are recommended download Zapya before going.  Controversies  = Temporary Removal From Google Play Store = For a week in October 2019, Zapya was removed from the Google Play Store and labeled as \\"harming other applications\\". It was determined that a third party software development kit (SDK) had been deemed harmful by the Google Play Policy team and any applications that had this SDK were deemed harmful. A new version of Zapya was listed on the Google Play Store that did not contain the harmful SDK. Dewmobile released a formal apology to users on 5 October 2019 and urged users to update their applications to the new version that complied with the Google Play Policies. = Provisional Ban in China = Even though Kuai Ya complies with Chinese censorship restrictions, it along with Zapya are banned in the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang. In November 2019, the leaked China Cables revealed that the Chinese government's mass surveillance and predictive-policing program Integrated Joint Operation Platform (IJOP) flagged 1.8 million users with Zapya and Kuai Ya on their phones for investigation as part of the crackdown on Uyghur Muslims. Zapya and Kuai Ya do not support Uyghur and Kazakh languages. It is unknown when the ban came about but recently travelers and residents found with either application downloaded on their phone are forced to uninstall the application.

He is often credited with creating the parenting advice industry through his many publications. Life and career Hecht was born in New York City in 1895 in a home that once stood on the site of Radio City. He attended the Ethical Culture School and graduated from Cornell University in 1917. With the outbreak of World War I, he became volunteer head of the financial department of New York's office of the American Ambulance Field Service and worked as a civilian for various war-related efforts, such as promoting the sale of Liberty Bonds and conducting research for the War Trade Board. He became head of the Bureau of Cartoons, encouraging cartoonists to publish work in support of the war effort, and he published a collection of war cartoons titled The War in Cartoons. Although he joined the United States Army as a private in 1918, he was not called to active service. After the war, Hecht edited Better Times, a monthly social welfare publication, which he turned into an influential weekly representing two thousand private and public charitable agencies. In 1925, he organized the Welfare Council of New York City. In 1938, he became founding secretary of the Greater New York Fund, which eventually merged with United Way of New York. Concerned about a lack of resources on parenting, Hecht received funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation to launch Parents magazine in September 1926. He asked Clara Savage Littledale multiple times to serve as the magazine's editor; she agreed in 1926 and would serve as editor until her death in 1956.Littledale, Clara Savage. Edited by Barbara Sicherman, 1934- and Carol Hurd Green, 1935-; in Notable American Women: The Modern Period (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980), 458-459 The magazine quickly became the most widely circulated magazine dedicated to parenting in the world, leading Hecht to launch a variety of other journals aimed at parents and children, including The Boy's and Girl's Newspaper, Your New Baby, Children's Digest, and Humpty Dumpty, which became the most popular children's magazine in the United States. In 1963, Hecht expanded his interest in children and toys by having Parents magazine purchase FAO Schwarz from the Schwarz family. He expanded the New York toy store nationwide by opening sixteen branches before selling the company in 1970. Hecht sponsored a training course for Santa Claus impersonators at the toy store. Hecht served as chairman of Child Welfare League of America, established and chaired the American Parents Committee in 1947, and chaired the National Committee on the Observance of Mother's Day. He advocated for various acts of federal legislation related to children and education, including the National Defense Education Act of 1958. Hecht also philanthropically supported programs related to world population control. Hecht died in 1980 at the age of 84. He was named one of the \\"100 Most Notable Cornellians\\" in 2003.

Career  Born in Germany in 1939, he spent his formative school years in Germany and the Principality of Liechtenstein. From 1959, he studied modern languages at the Interpreters' Institute of the University of the Saar, Saarbr√ºcken, Germany, and soon also took up law and economics at the Universities of Saarbr√ºcken and Kiel, as well as at academic organisations in London and Paris. From the mid-1960s, Kasper worked first on the small research staff of the German Council of Economic Advisors and then at the Kiel Institute of World Economics. He earned a Ph.D. summa cum laude from Kiel University on issues in international finance. In the early 1970s, he served as a Harvard University Advisor to the Malaysian Minister of Finance in Kuala Lumpur. Subsequently, he joined the Australian National University in Canberra. From 1977 to 1999, he was the foundation professor of economics of the University of New South Wales, first at Royal Military College, Duntroon, then at the new Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) in Canberra. He also undertook work assignments at the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris and the Federal Reserve of San Francisco. From 1999 to 2006, he served as a senior fellow of the Centre for Independent Studies, a Sydney-based free-market think tank. In 2003, the Commonwealth government awarded him the Centenary Medal for his work in economics.Australian Government's It's an Honour listing Kasper has a long record of research and consulting for international businesses and governments. An early interest was the reform of the international monetary system, having been the ‚ÄòBenjamin‚Äô in the eminent B√ºrgenstock Group of academics and bankers, who paved the way for floating exchange rates in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He has also published on international migration and the relocation of industries from mature, high-cost economies to new, low- cost places, as well as on institutional economics, i.e. the importance of habits, work practices, customs, legislation and regulations to shaping a community's economic growth potential. In a complex modern economy with an emphasis on differentiated services, mores and laws constitute ‚Äòinstitutional capital‚Äô, which is central to international competitiveness and the long-term growth potential. Based on this conviction, he became an early advocate of liberalisation of factor and product markets in Australia and New Zealand.  Publications  Kasper has published some 20 monographs and more than 300 articles on political economy and institutional economics.Wolfgang Kasper publication list Some of his publications work have been translated into Mandarin, Turkish, Spanish, French, Hindi, Persian, Russian and Arabic.

After a falling out with party leader Pauline Hanson over company tax cuts, Burston left One Nation and joined businessman Clive Palmer's newly relaunched United Australia Party. Palmer announced Burston as the new parliamentary leader of the party on 18 June 2018. Early life Burston was born and grew up in Cessnock in the Hunter Region of New South Wales. He started an apprenticeship as a boilermaker with BHP at age 15. He has taught at TAFE NSW, trained TAFE teachers at Newcastle University and worked as a contract draftsman. He was employed at the former Newcastle Teachers College. He has been a councillor on Cessnock City Council. He married at age 22, had three children and later divorced. He married his second wife, a teacher named Rosie, in 2008. Their home overlooks Lake Macquarie. Burston became a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation soon after its inception. He is a former National Director of One Nation, serving alongside David Ettridge. In concert with the overthrow and imprisonment of Pauline Hanson, Burston left Pauline Hanson's One Nation and joined One Nation NSW, a splinter group of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, founded and led by David Oldfield. After Oldfield abandoned One Nation NSW, Burston rejoined Pauline Hanson's One Nation. Senator (2016‚Äì2019) After Burston was elected to the Senate at the 2016 federal election, he was elected as One Nation's party whip. In his maiden speech to parliament, Burston warned that large-scale immigration was undermining social cohesion, placing pressure on infrastructure and housing affordability and increasing crime in Australia. He also criticised \\"aggressive multiculturalism\\", stating: > It seems that every group pride is promoted in the media and schools except > for ours, the nation's. The ABC long ago abandoned any semblance of > patriotism, or even balance. Other taxpayer-funded media ‚Äì SBS and NITV ‚Äì > serve immigrants and indigenous Australians. The national flag is often > ignored or dishonoured in schools, while multiculturalism and indigenous > issues are now part of the curriculum. The majority of students are not > supported in their Anglo-Australian identity, but are made to feel guilty > for supposed historical injustices committed by their ancestors. Burston is a public opponent of same sex marriage, and was one of twelve senators who voted against what became the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017. In 2017, he was one of ten senators to vote in favour of Cory Bernardi's motion to ban gender-selective abortion. It was defeated by ten votes to 36. In May 2018, Burston announced he would support the Turnbull Government's proposed corporate tax cuts, a move that contradicts One Nation policy. He was soon demoted from the role of party whip, and reportedly attempted to leave One Nation for the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party. On 18 June 2018, he told the Senate he had resigned from One Nation to sit as an independent, but later that day he announced that he would join Clive Palmer's United Australia Party, as party leader. He became part of the economically-conservative voting bloc formed by crossbench Senators David Leyonhjelm, Cory Bernardi and Fraser Anning. In February 2019, Burston accused fellow Party Leader and Senator Pauline Hanson of sexual harassment in an incident which occurred in 1998. Burston was defeated at the 2019 federal election.

During this time, until 1979, he worked in this role at five different mines across Australia before becoming a mining engineer. Thereafter, he worked as an engineer and general manager for various companies such as Peabody Coal Company, Consolidation Coal Company and Atlantic Richfield, though he had not held paid employment for eight years prior to his election in 2016. =Coal mining= Gordonstone coal mine (now Kestrel coal mine) in 2007 From 1982 to 1988 Roberts worked as a manager for Coal & Allied at West Wallsend, New South Wales. The mine proved to be unprofitable due to its location, leading to its sale in 1988, at which time Roberts took a redundancy package. After completing an MBA, Roberts was appointed general manager at the Gordonstone coal mine in Queensland, the largest underground mine in Australia. Roberts left the role three years later. According to Roberts he resigned due to a lack of support during an industrial dispute, but others have suggested that he was let go after cost overruns at the mine. That was the end of Roberts' mining career. With his wife, in 1994 he started a management consultancy, Catalyst For Corporate Performance, and became involved in Eastern and alternative self-help techniques including meditation. =Volunteer work= Roberts served as chairman of the board of the Brisbane Montessori School from 1999 until 2003 and served voluntarily on the advisory board (as a parent representative member) of the International Montessori Council from 2000 until 2008.\\"Montessori schools distance themselves from One Nation's Malcolm Roberts\\", Kelsey Munro, The Sydney Morning Herald, 14 August 2016. Timothy Seldin, chairman of the Montessori Foundation, stated that Roberts' views \\"are not representative of Dr Montessori's global vision, and do not reflect the views of the Montessori Foundation or the International Montessori Council\\". =Climate change denial= Roberts' major interest and activity since ending his mining career is the denial of climate change. The catalyst was the 2006 film, An Inconvenient Truth on television. Galileo Movement Broadcaster Alan Jones is the patron of the Galileo Movement From 2006 until his election to the Senate, Roberts was a full-time political activist, speaking at rallies against the Labor Government's carbon tax, working for the climate change denying Galileo Movement, and sending hundreds of emails to political, scientific and media figures on the topic. He also met politicians, had universities launch academic inquiries into climate scientists and sent legal letters demanding the resignation of government ministers. Political career Roberts was elected to the Senate at the 2016 Australian federal election, running in second place on One Nation's ticket in Queensland, behind party leader Pauline Hanson. However, he was subsequently found to be ineligible for election. He received 77 first-preference votes in that election, the lowest number ever for a member of the federal parliament. =Climate change= Roberts promotes climate conspiracy theories, and does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change. He is the leader of the Galileo Movement, established in 2011. A 2011 Scientific American article on the group stated that it \\"recycles many of the same straw man arguments and distortions about the science that other groups have previously employed\\". His views were supported by Alan Jones, who is the patron of the Galileo Movement\\"Who we are\\", Galileo Movement. and interviewed Roberts on his breakfast program.\\"Alan Jones: Malcolm Roberts\\" , Alan Jones, 4BC, 18 October 2016. NASA Roberts frequently states that NASA has falsified climate data to exaggerate warming in the Arctic. In November 2016, Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told Roberts he was \\"mistaken\\" to assert NASA had removed data to hide Arctic warming in the 1940s. Schmidt stated that the data was freely available online and that Roberts should check it himself, adding that he was surprised that Roberts was in fact a senator, and that his allegation of inappropriate temperature data adjustment is \\"the definition of denial\\". Roberts' specific objection related to charts from Icelandic stations at Vestmannaeyjar and Teigarhorn, where temperatures from the 1930s and 1940s were adjusted down, removing the apparent warming recorded at that time. However a senior Icelandic meteorologist with a specialty in historical climatology emailed Roberts that the temperature adjustments, which were made because of a daytime bias and relocation of one of the stations, were \\"quite sound ... absolutely necessary and well founded\\". CSIROh! document Climate scientist David Karoly has been a prominent critic of Malcolm Roberts' views on climate change Roberts wrote a 300,000-word essay called CSIROh! (a play on the initialism CSIRO) that, according to a report in The Australian newspaper, claimed global warming is a UN-inspired hoax to introduce an \\"antihuman\\" socialist New World Order, aided by bankers and politicians. The essay was described as \\"conspiracist rubbish\\" by climate scientist David Karoly and \\"utterly stupid\\" by conservative commentator Andrew Bolt. The CSIROh! document contained an attack on the environment editor of one of Australia's major newspapers, Ben Cubby of The Sydney Morning Herald. In it, Roberts charged that Cubby had failed to report on corruption of climate science, was ignorant of science, and that his articles were dishonest, inaccurate and spread corruption of climate science, inter alia. Roberts sent a copy of CSIROh! to Cubby and demanded a response. Cubby responded by commenting that the essay was \\"littered with errors of all kinds: a mish-mash of muddled conjecture, impossible leaps of logic, fundamental misunderstandings of the scientific method, misread and misquoted research that has been poorly cited, internal contradictions, confused dates, spelling mistakes, and strangled grammar. It is, in all respects, a dud.\\"  CSIRO briefing and response In 2016, Roberts requested a briefing from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) on scientific evidence of human-caused global warming. The briefing was delivered in September 2016, after which Roberts said he would consider the CSIRO's evidence, but also accused the CSIRO of pushing the \\"de-industrialisation\\" of Australia, and added that policies to mitigate climate change were \\"anti-human\\".\\"Malcolm Roberts says he will consider CSIRO's evidence on climate change\\", Paul Karp, The Guardian, 26 September 2016. On 6 November 2016 Roberts delivered his response to the briefing, presenting a 42-page report titled \\"On Climate, CSIRO Lacks Empirical Proof\\", co-authored by Timothy Ball and Tony Heller. The report by Roberts and his co-authors included the spurious claim that sea level was not rising. They said that carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere \\"is not and cannot be affected by human production\\" and cannot affect atmospheric temperatures, denying the greenhouse effect. Their report misrepresented the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, alleged that international banks profit from climate change, and said that Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Maurice Strong \\"was remarkably successful in gaining control of weather agencies\\". It said that \\"Misrepresentation of science and climate is a form of control over people's minds\\" and that \\"schools today subtly teach people what to think\\". Roberts demanded that the Australian government set up an independent inquiry into the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. He also demanded that Australia reject the Paris Agreement and leave the United Nations. The CSIRO subsequently issued a statement that \\"CSIRO stands behind its peer-reviewed science on environment, climate and climate change\\". Clash with Brian Cox In a clash between Roberts and physicist Brian Cox on the live television talk show Q&A; on ABC TV broadcast 15 August 2016, Roberts claimed that engineer and blogger Steven Goddard (a pseudonym of Tony Heller) had shown the NASA temperature data for the 1930s were \\"warmer than recent decades\\".Q&A;: Professor Brian Cox takes on senator-elect Malcolm Roberts in climate change stoush, ABC News Online, 16 August 2016 In The Guardian's assessment, Roberts was referring to a debunked conspiracy theory that claimed 1934 was hotter than 1998. Cox then asked if NASA, the Australian Academy of Science, and the Met Office in the UK were all collaborating to manipulate global temperature data, to which Roberts asked if he was being accused of claiming they were all collaborating, to which Cox responded: \\"What, they've all manipulated it in the same way and accidentally got to the same answer? Is that what you're saying?\\" =Repealing Racial Discrimination Act= Roberts is an advocate for freedom of speech, having called for the repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which makes it an offence to publicly \\"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\\" another person because of their race. He believes the 1995 section of the law was passed to \\"nobble\\" Andrew Bolt, a journalist who did not come to prominence until the early 2000s and was taken to court in 2011 by a group of Aboriginal people who were racially discriminated by an article he wrote in The Herald Sun, ordered to pay their legal costs, apologise and not publish the article again.. The presiding judge, Justice Bromberg, did not accept that 18D of the Act should provide a defence because he considered that the text contained \\"erroneous facts, distortions of the truth and inflammatory and provocative language\\". Bromberg also wrote \\"The intrusion into freedom of expression is of no greater magnitude than that which would have been imposed by the law of defamation if the conduct in question and its impact upon the reputations of many of the identified individuals had been tested against its compliance with that law\\". On ABC TV, Roberts said \\"You can call me short, you can call me fat... Whatever you want to call me, the only person who decides whether I'm upset is me\\".\\"Aussie conservatives seek repeal of law against racist speech\\", Jonathan Pearlman, The Straits Times, 24 August 2016. Roberts has blocked multiple people from responding to his tweets, in what has been described as contradictory to his free speech advocacy., Tom Allen, HuffPost, 31 March 2017. =Australian Building and Construction Commission= Malcolm Roberts supports the reestablishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, which would have powers to fight union corruption in the construction industry, because he believes that its existence would promote freedom. He has stated that \\"we want to protect union members rather than the union bosses,\\" and criticised the CFMEU for its impact upon small businesses.\\"Malcolm Roberts reveals One Nation intends to support Coalition's ABCC bill\\", Paul Karp, The Guardian, 23 October 2016. =Welfare= In his time in the senate, Roberts and One Nation voted with the government on a number of welfare cuts. =Sovereign citizen= Roberts has frequently used a style of writing and terminology linked to the sovereign citizen movement, created by David Wynn Miller. This movement sees governments as illegitimate and attempts to assert the rights of individuals to ignore laws and taxes. Members of this movement aspire to exist outside both the social and legal bounds of society, and use colons and hyphens to evade what they claim is government enslavement via grammar. In 2011, Roberts wrote an affidavit to then Prime Minister Julia Gillard ‚Äì addressing her as \\"The Woman, Julia- Eileen: Gillard., acting as The Honourable JULIA EILEEN GILLARD\\" ‚Äî demanding that she sign a contract exempting him from paying the carbon tax and compensation of up to $280,000 if she didn't provide him with disclosure on 28 points, including evidence that \\"the Commonwealth of Australia CIK# 000805157 is not a corporation registered on the United States of America securities exchange\\". Roberts signed himself as \\"Malcolm-Ieuan: Roberts., the living soul\\". He has used this form of sovereign citizen address since, in a list of acknowledgements he wrote in 2013. Roberts is a prolific letter writer. He writes to politicians, government agencies, universities and scientists. The topic of these letters is mostly formal complaints regarding allegations of corruption in climate science. He keeps an archive of his letters and replies at his website. Roberts stated in 2016 that he did not identify as a \\"sovereign citizen\\". =Same-sex marriage= Roberts is against same-sex marriage and supported the Same Sex Marriage Plebiscite. =United Nations= Roberts believes that the United Nations is a threat to the Australian way of life: \\"Australian values and way of life are also at risk from insidious institutions such as the unelected swill that is the United Nations. Australia must leave the UN. We need an OzExit.\\" He states that the UN is \\"destroying Australia‚Äôs sovereignty through deals such as Agenda 21\\". =International banking= In 135-page document titled \\"Why? Motives Driving Climate Fraud\\", Roberts states that international bankers (the Rothschilds, Goldman Sachs, the Rockefellers and the Warburg family) are surreptitiously trying to gain global control through environmentalism. Roberts' document cites the work of Eustace Mullins, an American anti-Semite and Holocaust denier who claimed that international banks and the US Federal Reserve were part of a Jewish conspiracy to introduce global socialism. Roberts rejects the assertion that he is an anti-Semite, noting that two of the founders of the Galileo Movement were Jewish, and stated that \\"I respect and admire the Jews\\".\\"Malcolm Roberts loves the Jews, and other insights from a bizarre climate change press conference\\", Josh Taylor, Crikey, 7 November 2016. =US politics= Malcolm Roberts displayed a Gadsden flag at Parliament after Donald Trump's victory in the United States presidential election of 2016 Roberts commented on the 2016 US presidential election by stating that \\"the only safe space for Hillary to occupy is a prison cell\\", and that he'd \\"settle for [her] going to Guantanamo, along with other terrorists\\". Roberts stated that his party, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, had hired former Trump economic adviser, Darren Brady Nelson. Roberts celebrated the victory of president-elect Donald Trump by displaying a Gadsden flag at Parliament. He stated that the result supported his belief that people shouldn't serve the government, but the government should serve the people.\\"One Nation senator unfurls revolutionary flag to celebrate Donald Trump victory\\", 9 News, 10 November 2016. =Senate eligibility and aftermath= Following the 2017 resignations of Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters due to dual citizenship and Matt Canavan's resignation from the Cabinet for similar reasons, Roberts' place of birth and citizenship was scrutinised by the media. Roberts released a statutory declaration to the effect that he is only an Australian citizen, despite birth records showing that he had previously been identified as a British national. A spokesperson for Roberts stated that Roberts was \\"choosing to believe that he was never British\\". Doubts persisted about the status of Roberts' Indian citizenship after it was argued in the media that under a precedent set by the Supreme Court of India, he continued to be a 'presumed citizen' of the country. On 9 August 2017 the Senate referred his position to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns. The reference was moved by his party leader Pauline Hanson, with his support. On 22 September 2017, the High Court of Australia found that Roberts was a citizen of the United Kingdom, through descent from his Welsh father, when he was elected at the 2016 federal election. His suitability for retaining his Senate seat depended on whether he had taken appropriate steps to renounce his British citizenship prior to his nomination. Between August and October 2017, Roberts stated several changing and contradictory positions regarding his citizenship, including that he had \\"absolute conviction\\" of being an Australian upon nomination, that he had emailed British authorities on 1 May 2016, first requesting to renounce his citizenship, and upon receiving no reply for a month, sent a subsequent email on 6 June (three days after his nomination) stating, \\"As there was no reply to my email last month (see below) and although I am confident I am not a British citizen, with this email I renounce any British citizenship should it exist.\\" It was subsequently revealed that the email domains that Roberts had contacted were defunct and no longer in use. Roberts sent a formal application to renounce his United Kingdom citizenship on 2 November 2016, and his renouncement became official on 5 December 2016. A final decision regarding Roberts's senatorial eligibility was scheduled to be heard by the High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, between 10 and 12 October 2017. However, the Court delegated the fact-finding task to a single judge, Justice Keane, before whom Roberts appeared on 21 September and who reported his findings on the following day. Following Roberts's birth in India, the UK High Commission registered his birth as a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and the Australian Trade Commissioner made an entry in his mother's passport that he \\"is the child of an Australian citizen but has not acquired Australian citizenship\\". The British nationality experts' opinion was that Roberts became a British citizen at birth (whether registered or not), and ceased to be a British citizen on 5 December 2016 when his renunciation was registered. Keane J found that Roberts knew he did not become an Australian citizen until May 1974 and that, when he nominated for the Senate, he knew there was a possibility that he might have been, and remained, a citizen of the United Kingdom. Keane J found that his actions before nomination had been ineffectual to renounce his UK citizenship, which had been belatedly renounced on 5 December 2016. On 27 October 2017 the full High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, ruled that Roberts had been ineligible to be elected to the Parliament. Roberts and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson subsequently announced that Roberts would nominate as a candidate for the electoral district of Ipswich at the 2017 Queensland state election. He was not elected. In February 2018, it was announced that Roberts would lead the One Nation Senate ticket in Queensland at the 2019 Australian federal election. Pauline Hanson said: \\"Malcolm Roberts has got the reputation as a powerhouse, the empirical science man, and he's really taken it up to members of parliament\\". In September 2017, before the High Court ruling on Roberts's eligibility, blogger Tony Magrathea initiated a High Court action alleging that Roberts had sat in the Senate while disqualified, contrary to the Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975. On 24 June 2019, the High Court found the allegation proved and ordered Roberts to pay a penalty of $6,000 to Magrathea. With his citizenship clear, Roberts was elected to the Senate again in 2019.https://www.sbs.com.au/news/malcolm-roberts-returns-to-senate-for-one- nation-as-sa-wa-and-queensland-teams-finalised See also *Climate change in Australia References External links * Summary of parliamentary voting for Senator Malcolm Roberts on TheyVoteForYou.org.au * Senator Malcolm Roberts (Parliamentary Profile) * Malcolm Roberts (Qld) (official One Nation page) * Senator Malcolm Roberts For Queensland (official Senator page) * The Work of Malcolm Roberts (personal website) 1955 births Living people Australian engineers Critics of the United Nations Australian conspiracy theorists One Nation members of the Parliament of Australia Members of the Australian Senate for Queensland Members of the Australian Senate People from Paschim Bardhaman district University of Queensland alumni 21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Malcolm Roberts (politician)"},{"id":"51241832","text":"thumb Tegenungan Waterfall is a waterfall in Bali, Indonesia.

Founded in 1919 as Aabyh√∏j Idr√¶tsforening \\"Thrott\\" by a group of local young men, the club mainly features association football. The men's team competes in the Jutland Series, the fifth tier of the Danish football league system and the highest division of the regional DBU Jutland association. A club focusing mainly on youth development, Aabyh√∏j IF has brought forward players such as John Stampe, John Amdisen, Finn Overby, Lars Jensen, Tom Bonde, Claus Christiansen, Peter Vesterdal, Henrik Bundgaard and Frederik Krabbe. History Having been founded on 8 July 1919 as Aabyh√∏j Idr√¶tsforening \\"Thrott\\", the club had its first home ground at √Öby √òsterg√•rd close to Silkeborgvej, a main boulevard in Aarhus. The name Thrott comes from the , which means \\"strength\\". The club became a member of Jydsk Boldspil-Union (JBU) in 1920, and in September of that year, Aabyh√∏j IF played its first noteworthy matches in a tournament against teams from AGF, AIA, Aarhus 1900, Vejlby IK. At this point, a wrestling department had already formed in the club, which still today bears the name Thrott. Later, tennis, athletics, boxing and gymnastics were added as new departments, and the club also featured a women's department with Danish longball and gymnastics. Because the departments could not agree on financial distribution, the club split in three parts as the wrestling and tennis departments became independent clubs. In 1921, Aabyh√∏j IF moved their home ground to an area between Silkeborgvej and √Öbyvej, where a stadium was opened in 1929. A new stadium - Aabyh√∏j Stadium - was opened on 2 July 1944, where the club continues to play its home games. A clubhouse was built adjacent to the stadium in 1969; the club's 50th anniversary. Despite Aabyh√∏j IF never having made the higher divisions of Danish football, the club has become an established institution in Aarhus.

It served in the China/Manchuria theater throughout the war. History The 3rd Tank Regiment was created in 1937 by upgrading the 3rd Tank Battalion. At the end of January 1939, Lieutenant Colonel Kiyotake Yoshimaru took command of the regiment; Yoshimaru was promoted to full colonel in March, and under him the regiment participated in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union in 1939, as part of the 1st Tank Corps. The other regiment of the 1st Tank Corps was the 4th Tank Regiment, which was equipped mostly with light tanks, and the 1st Tank Corps was part of the Yasuoka Detachment under Major General Masaomi Yasuoka. At this time the 3rd Tank Regiment had the following order of battle: * 26 Type 89 I-Go medium tanks armed with a short-barrelled (low-velocity) Type 90 57 mm gun * 4 Type 97 Chi- Ha medium tanks armed with the similar Type 97 57 mm tank gun * 4 Type 97 tankettes armed with a Type 94 37 mm tank gun * 7 Type 94 tankettes armed with a light machine guns Japanese armor fared poorly in these battles, the low- velocity guns being unable to penetrate Soviet armor, while being themselves vulnerable to Soviet high-velocity tank guns. Colonel Yoshimaru himself was killed when his command tank was destroyed by Soviet gun fire on 3 July 1939. During the action of 2 and 3 July, the 3rd Tank Regiment was badly mauled by the Soviet army forces. 3rd Tank Regiment was included in 1st Tank Division when the division was formed at Ningan in Manchukuo in June 1942. The 3rd Tank Regiment was detached from the 1st Armored Division and attached to 11th Army for Operation Ichi-Go against China in 1944.

It often intersects with the historic Back-to-Africa movement and general Black separatism, but also manifests in present and historic demands for self- determination on North American soil, ranging from autonomy to independence. Reparations for slavery and other oppressions are often a key demand for advocates of African-American self-determination. Much of the self- determination dialogue has focused on the region in the Southern United States from Virginia to Texas, and has ranged from self-governing admittance as a state to outright secession from U.S. governance. As U.S. state =Edwin P. McCabe in Oklahoma= Former Kansas State Auditor Edwin P. McCabe joined the migration of thousands of African-Americans to the Oklahoma Territory in 1890, and then promoted African-American migration to the territory. By 1892, from the city of Langston, he geared his promotion toward the goal of a black- majority state that would eventually send two African-American senators to Congress in Washington, D.C., and to guarantee a black majority in every congressional district of the new state. He helped populate at least twenty- five new black-majority towns in the territory to the goal of black-majority statehood, even as white racial sentiments soured against African-Americans in the territory enough to implement segregation in the territory's laws by the time Oklahoma Territory was merged with the Indian Territory to become the state of Oklahoma in 1907. In the end, neither a black majority nor McCabe's dreams of a governorship over a black-majority state were realized. =Oscar Brown Sr.= The National Movement for the Establishment of a 49th State was established by Chicago-based businessman Oscar Brown, Sr., who sought for the formation of a state within the union on U.S. soil which could be populated and governed by African-Americans, and which could apportion the benefits of the New Deal more equitably to African-Americans. Eventually, the organization fizzled out before the eventual 49th state, Alaska, was admitted to the Union in 1959. Republic of New Afrika The Republic of New Afrika was an organization which sought three key goals: * Creation of an independent African-American-majority country situated in the southeastern United States, in the heart of black-majority population. A similar claim is made for all the black-majority counties and cities throughout the United States. * Payment of several billion dollars in reparations to African-American descendants of slaves by the US government for the damages inflicted on Africans and their descendants by chattel enslavement, Jim Crow segregation, and modern-day forms of racism. * A referendum of all African Americans to determine their desires for citizenship; movement leaders say they were not offered a choice in this matter after emancipation in 1865 following the American Civil War. Established in 1968, the RNA attracted a number of members, including Robert F. Williams, Betty Shabazz and Chokwe Lumumba. The organization persists to this day. American Communist support =During the USSR= The idea for outright independence was also adopted by American communist activists. Throughout US history, several revolutionary organizations have sought to promote control of the region as a separate political nation within the United States. The black liberation activist Cyril Briggs wrote a number of editorials starting in 1917 which called for a \\"colored autonomous state\\" on U.S. soil, first in the publication Amsterdam News and later in the publication The Crusader which he founded in 1918. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) later adopted the suggestion that African Americans in the \\"Black Belt\\" region constituted an oppressed nation, and that they should be allowed to vote on self-determination, as had populations following World War I under rules of the League of Nations. After fierce debate in the Sixth World Congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1928, the CPUSA officially adopted a plan for self-determination for an African-American nation in the region.Sherman, Vincent (2012). Nations Want Liberation: The Black Belt Nation in the 21st Century http://return2source.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/nations-want-liberation-the- black-belt-nation-in-the-21st-century/ Although Josef Stalin was the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the time and the architect of the Comintern's line on the national question, the Black Belt national proposal drew its roots from the thinking of Vladimir Lenin, who identified what he described as an African-American nation in the southern US. American activist Harry Haywood is generally recognized as the principal theoretician of the CPUSA's Black Belt line. Given the CPUSA's proposal on the national question, it enjoyed large-scale party growth in the US South. But the party was also involved in organizing agricultural workers and supporting African-American civil rights, which most blacks considered more important. In Alabama, for instance, the Party organized the Sharecroppers' Union (SCU) in 1931, which grew to \\"a membership of nearly 2,000 organized in 73 locals, 80 women's auxiliaries, and 30 youth groups.\\" The SCU was openly organized by Alabama communists, and while it drew substantial support from the African-American community, it was subject to a harsh crackdown by state and non-state actors. Nevertheless, it helped lead a strike of agricultural workers for higher wages. > \\"[T]he SCU claimed some substantial victories. On most of the plantations > affected, the union won at least seventy-five cents per one hundred pounds, > and in areas not affected by the strike, landlords reportedly increased > wages from thirty-five cents per hundred pounds to fifty cents or more in > order to avert the spread of the strike.\\" During the same period, the CPUSA also alienated much of the African-American working class by excoriating other self-determination organizations such as the Movement for a 49th State and the back-to-Africa-oriented Peace Movement of Ethiopia for not toeing the party line on self-determination. In 1935, the CPUSA abandoned its line on national self-determination for the Black Belt. It wanted to attract coalition support from middle-class African-American groups in the Northeast as a part of the Party's \\"Hands Off Ethiopia\\" campaign. It launched this effort after Italian forces under Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in the same year. The CPUSA criticized the invasion as part of the colonial enterprise. Haywood and similar members tried to promote the Black Belt national question in the 1950s, without success. Communists did not officially support this concept again until the New Communist Movement of the 1970s and 1980s. After being expelled by the CPUSA, Haywood joined the October League (OL), which eventually became the Communist Party (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) in the United States. Both the OL and the CP (ML) adopted the old CPUSA line calling for self-determination for residents of the Black Belt. Other New Communist Movement groups, like the Communist League and the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, also took up the Black Belt line. =In the 21st century= In the 21st century, several communist organizations have continued to uphold the Black Belt national question. Chief among them is the Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO), which continues to organize around the line.Staff (February 11, 2014). \\"Racism, national oppression of African Americans at the core of Jordan Davis killing\\", Fight Back!

In his early political career, he was Mayor of H√† N·ªôi from 1952 until Vietnam was partitioned at the 17th parallel as a result of the Geneva Accord in 1954.

Biography Chemnitz's parents were Kanuthus Josefsen and Juliane Kielsen. She married J√∏rgen Chemnitz in 1917, and together they had six children, including Guldborg and Lars Chemnitz. Early in 1900, there were no educational opportunities for women in Greenland. She therefore got a job as a maid, with a Danish family. She traveled to Denmark with this family to Denmark, where they tried to enroll her in school, but Chemnitz was rejected on the grounds that she would not be respected in Denmark. As a result of this refusal, Chemnitz later became a champion of Greenlandic women's education. Chemnitz married into an influential and well- educated family. This gave her an opportunity to help establish the first women's association in Greenland in Nuuk in 1948. Chemnitz was president of the new organization, and she later established several local women's associations, which were combined into a national organization in 1960 with her as the chair. This association was called The Greenland Women Societies Association (APK ‚Äì Kalaallit Nunaanni Arnat Illuat Kattuffiat). In 1948, she became a member of the Greenland Commission, as the only Greenlandic woman. Here she had jobs in several committees and with others, secured the establishment of schools in Qaqortoq and Aasiaat. When her position ended in 1950, she was awarded the Royal Medal of Recompense in gold. Death and legacy Chemnitz died at Nuuk in 1978.

The company is based in Irvine, California. Cylance has been described as ‚Äúthe first company to apply artificial intelligence, algorithms, and machine learning to cyber security.‚Äù In February 2019, the company was acquired by BlackBerry Limited. The company's mission is to block computer viruses or malware before they have an effect on a user's computer. Founding Cylance was founded by Stuart McClure and Ryan Permeh. McClure was previously co-founder of Foundstone, a security consultancy. He sold Foundstone to McAfee in 2004, and became that firm's Chief Tech Officer. McClure is also the author of Hacking Exposed, reportedly the best-selling IT security book to date. Cylance's founding came about as a result of McClure's speeches on cybersecurity. In them, he was often asked how he protected his own computer. He noted that he lacked trust in any security technology since it was all reactive in nature (for example, legacy antivirus technology), meaning it only cleaned up after an attack or prevented it a second time. Consequently, McClure began developing a technology based on \\"proactive protection\\". Funding Initial funding of $15 million was reported February 2013 with another $20 million in February 2014. A July 2015 report indicated that Cylance had raised an additional $42 million from investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Dell, CapitalOne, and TenEleven Ventures. Cylance received another $100 million in June 2016 with lead investors Blackstone Tactical Opportunities (part of The Blackstone Group) and Insight Venture Partners. They received an investment from In-Q-Tel in September 2015. =Product Features= McClure has stated that Cylance's antivirus product does not use typical security features, such as unique signatures, heuristics, behavioral analysis, sandboxing, virtualization, or blacklisting. Rather, the product uses artificial intelligence to identify and stop attackers. McClure has stated that Cylance's security features are similar to the human brain's way of identifying threats, wherein it \\"teaches\\" computers to identify indicators of an attack. Operation Cleaver Operation Cleaver was a covert cyberwarfare operation carried out by the Iranian government against targets around the world, specifically critical infrastructure entities. Cylance uncovered the operation and described it in a report released in late 2014. Iranian officials rejected Cylance's conclusions, but the FBI tacitly confirmed them. MOTEX Collaboration In May 2016, Cylance announced a new collaboration with MOTEX, an Osaka-based firm, to integrate MOTEX LanScope, an endpoint security management, and CylancePROTECT, Cylance's leading product, which proactively detects and prevents malware. The end product will be called CylancePROTECT Cat. This collaboration brings Cylance's activities into the Japanese market. Acquisition by BlackBerry Limited In February 2019, the company was acquired by BlackBerry Limited for $1.4 billion. Honors and awards The company has won several awards. In March 2018, Cylance won the 2018 MSPWorld Cup Award. In November 2017, LinkedIn recognized Cylance as one of the \\"Top Companies Startups\\" of the year 2017. In October 2017, Cylance was certified as a \\"Great Place to Work\\" on GreatPlaceToWork.com. In October 2017, Cylance was recognized as a Cyber Security Leader of 2017 in Cyber Defense Magazine. In September 2017, Cylance was announced a winner of the Gartner Peer Insights Customer Choice Award for Endpoint Protection Platforms by Gartner Inc. In August 2017, Cylance made the Inc. Magazine's Inc. 5000 List for the second year in a row. In June 2017, Cylance won the Special Jury Award for Best of Show - Security Product at Interop Tokyo 2017. In June 2017, Cylance's top product, CylancePROTECT, was named Best Enterprise Security Solution at the 2017 SC Media Awards Europe event. In May 2017, Cylance made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for the second year in a row. In April 2017, Cylance was given a 5-star rating in CRN's 2017 Partner Program Guide. In March 2017, CylancePROTECT was named Best Endpoint Protection Product of 2016 by SANS Community. In July 2016, McClure was named Orange County Entrepreneur of the Year in the category of technology. In 2016, Cylance was ranked #23 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.

From 1987 to 2000, he was a professor in the department of pathology at University of Chicago and was the chairman of the Committee on Immunology. From 1995 to 2000, he was the director of the Ben May Institute for Cancer Research. In 2000, he moved to the University of California, San Francisco to direct the UCSF Diabetes Center and metabolic research unit. Bluestone heads the Immune Tolerance Network, a consortium of over 1000 scientists to focus efforts on the development of immune tolerance therapies. From 2010 to 2015, he was the executive vice chancellor and provost of University of California, San Francisco. As the provost, he set up a lot of the academic industry collaborations currently in place at UCSF. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences He is a member of the editorial board for Immunity. Research The Bluestone group is particularly focused on studying the role of T cell receptors on Regulatory T cells (\\"Tregs\\"). In the early 90s, he identified the role of CD28 and its interaction with CTLA-4 The development of soluble receptors of CTLA-4 led to the development of the drugs abatacept and later belatacept. Further work with James P. Allison to target CTLA-4 resulted in the development of immune checkpoint therapies also known as immunotherapy. This led to the clinical development of ipilimumab (Yervoy‚Ñ¢), which was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Their current work on understanding Tregs may lead to further developments to treat Type 1 Diabetes.

Biography  = UC Berkeley = Xin started his work on the Spark open source project while he was a PhD candidate at the UC Berkeley AMPLab. The first research project, Shark, created a system that was able to efficiently execute SQL and advanced analytics workloads at scale. Shark won Best Demo Award at SIGMOD 2012. Shark was one of the first open source interactive SQL on Hadoop systems, with claims that it was between 10 and 100 times faster than Apache Hive. Shark was used by technology companies such as Yahoo, although it was replaced by a newer system called Spark SQL in 2014. The second research project, GraphX, created a graph processing system on top of Spark, a general data-parallel system. GraphX at the same challenged the notion that specialized systems are necessary for graph computation. GraphX was released as an open source project and merged into Spark in 2014, as the graph processing library on Spark. = Databricks = In 2013, along with Matei Zaharia and other key Spark contributors, Xin co-founded Databricks, a venture-backed company based in San Francisco that offers data platform as a service, based on Spark. In 2014, Xin led a team of engineers from Databricks to compete in the Sort Benchmark and won the 2014 world record in Daytona GraySort using Spark, beating the previous record held by Apache Hadoop by 30 times. Xin claimed that Spark was the fastest open source engine for sorting a petabyte of data. While at Databricks, he also started the DataFrames project, Project Tungsten, and Structured Streaming.

A key forward, Weideman is tall and weighs . He played top-level football early, playing in the TAC Cup as a bottom-aged player. His achievements as a junior included two best and fairest awards and national representation. Even though an ankle injury forced him to miss the majority of his final year of junior football, he was drafted by Melbourne with the ninth selection in the 2015 AFL draft. He made his AFL debut in 2016, making him a third-generation footballer, whereby he is the grandson of the Collingwood Football Club's 1958 premiership captain, Murray Weideman, and the son of former Collingwood player, Mark Weideman. Early life Weideman in February 2017 Weideman was born into an Australian rules football family with his grandfather, Murray Weideman, playing 180 matches for the Collingwood Football Club, including winning two premierships (he captained the 1958 premiership), winning three Copeland Trophies as Collingwood's best and fairest, and is a member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame; his father, Mark Weideman, also played for Collingwood, playing 28 games. Although both his father and grandfather played for Collingwood, he grew up a passionate supporter of the Richmond Football Club. He attended Whitefriars College, graduating year twelve in 2015, and he played his junior football with the Vermont Football Club in the Eastern Football League where he won back-to-back best and fairests after switching from a ruckman to a forward at 16 years of age. He played with the Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup as a bottom-aged player in 2014, and despite an iron deficiency and an ankle stress fracture hampering his second half of the season, he played fifteen matches and kicked nineteen goals. He received a scholarship within the prestigious AFL Academy for 2015, which included playing in the curtain raiser for the 2014 AFL Grand Final with the under-17 Australian team. Returning to the Eastern Ranges in 2015, Weideman played five matches, kicking nine goals, including five goals in one match against the Dandenong Stingrays. As part of the AFL Academy, he played two matches in April against Victorian Football League (VFL) sides, and the , both at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in the second match, his first quarter saw him kick two goals and take five marks and he was named in the best players by AFL Media. He received mid-year honours through selection with Vic Metro for the 2015 AFL Under 18 Championships, and he was named vice-captain, however a re-aggravation of his ankle injury saw him ruled out for the entire championships and the remainder of the TAC Cup season. After playing no football since May, doubts surrounded Weideman and his injuries, however Eastern Ranges talent manager, Len Villani, noted \\"his qualities made him a rare commodity\\", and the AFL Academy coach, Brad Johnson, stated \\"every now and then you‚Äôll see things from him and you know with good development into the future, he‚Äôs going to turn into a really strong, consistent performer\\" and \\"the right people have seen enough already through his junior days to say he‚Äôll be able to get back to some pretty strong fitness, work on his endurance and become a really good hit-up forward\\". Along with comparisons to forward, Matthew Pavlich, and forward, Tom Lynch, he was predicted to still be drafted inside the top ten in the 2015 national draft. AFL career After being linked to the Melbourne Football Club in the weeks leading to the 2015 national draft, Weideman was drafted by them with their second selection and ninth overall. After Melbourne declared they would take a \\"patient approach\\" with him, he played with Melbourne's affiliate team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), the Casey Scorpions, and he kicked four goals in his debut match against along with four goals against the and three against . The match against Coburg was labelled his best for the year by Casey coach, Justin Plapp, and after kicking twenty goals from eleven matches, he made his AFL debut the next week in the twenty-nine point win against the Hawthorn Football Club at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round 20. His debut match was praised within the AFL industry for him \\"having an immediate impact\\" and he was labelled as \\"impressive\\", where he kicked a goal with his first kick and amassed six disposals in the first quarter, finishing with two goals and thirteen disposals. During his debut match, he suffered a corked thigh which meant he missed the forty point win against at the Adelaide Oval the next week. He returned in round 22 for the twenty point loss against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and he played the remaining two matches of the season to finish with three matches and three goals for the season. After the AFL season finished, he played in Casey's finals campaign, including the grand final loss to at Etihad Stadium.

MacGyver has been described as \\"a good ambassador of the giant lizard world\\" for his docile and apparently affectionate behavior.  Background  MacGyver was hatched at Ty Park's lizard farm in Punta Gorda, Florida, on July 4, 2012. He became an Internet sensation later that year when his first viral video, a montage of short clips, appeared on YouTube and received hundreds of thousands of views in the time span of a few weeks. Since the age of three weeks, he has starred in numerous videos in which he appears to come when his owners call his name. He is also regularly seen eating his favorite foods: salmon, eggs, cherries, and grapes, as well as cuddling with his owners.  Fandom  MacGyver's videos have received tens of millions of combined video views across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.

He was the 1985 recipient of the Graduate Student Research Manuscript Award from the Poultry Science Association.

At Clemson, in addition to his teaching and research duties, Skewes served as chair of the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Skewes also serves on the editorial board of the scholarly journal Poultry Science. =Politics= In May 2016 Skewes won the nomination of the American Party of South Carolina in a three-way contest; the party had been founded in 2014 by former South Carolina Superintendent of Education Jim Rex. According to Skewes, he was motivated to run for president because, for the first time in his life he was \\"not going to be able to vote for the president with a clear conscience\\", regardless of which of the Democratic or Republican candidates were ultimately nominated by their respective parties. During his campaign, he walked 240 miles across South Carolina as part of a publicity stunt to raise awareness for his candidacy. Rex commented on Skewes' walk that it was \\"a testament to the fact that the American Party has an ability to attract a different type of person to run for public office\\". According to Skewes' campaign website, he advocated eliminating Super PACs, abolishing the United States Electoral College, supporting family planning education to \\"reduce unplanned pregnancies\\", and instituting \\"a national drug registry to reduce abuse of prescription drugs\\". Skewes told the Greenville News that he would consider his candidacy a success if he placed third in the presidential vote in South Carolina. Skewes ultimately placed eighth out of eight candidates, receiving 3,221 votes, or about 0.2-percent of the total ballots cast in South Carolina.

The friar practiced a rigorous spiritual life and undertook frequent bouts of fasting in addition to periods of strict silence as both an act of meditation and repentance. One of the hermitages he dwelled in for a long period of time was that of San Giovanni somewhere around Bevagna. In 1256 the townsfolk of Gualdo Cattaneo began wanting a church to replace a long- abandoned convent and in 1258 approached the Benedictine monks of San Pancrazio and requested them to provide the town with their former convent. The citizens persuaded the monks to donate the convent to the Augustinians at which point Ugolino accepted this former Benedictine residence and began the process of renovating it for his order's needs. He and Angelo da Foligno founded this convent for the order in Gualdo Cattaneo in 1258 at which point Ugolino was made its first prior - the religious served as such for the remainder of his life. A fellowship was opened and named after him though was dissolved after its 1568 suppression. He died in 1260. His remains were transferred in 1262 to the church of Santi Antonio e Antonino.

Tomberlin of the Mississippi Quarterly wrote that \\"Linking the sections through the introductions gives the volume greater unity than one might expect in such a collaborative enterprise.\\" =First section= Beeth's opening section, \\"Historians, Houston, and History,\\" discusses the state of scholarship in the newly-emerging field of urban studies; he stated that academics previously had biases against urban history and local history, there were very few such studies in previous eras, and there had been a lack of preservation of sources prior to the 1970s. In addition Houston's post-secondary institutions had not yet fully developed,Toberlin. and he added that there had previously been a lack of interest in the history of Houston, but research interest in local history began to increase at area universities and Houston's changing character also attracted interest in its history.Marchiafava, p. 146. =Second section= The first collection of essays focuses on the 19th century. Tamara Myner Haygood in \\"Use and Distribution of Slave Labor in Harris County, Texas, 1836‚Äì60\\" described the role of slaves in Houston as well as surrounding parts of Harris County.Haley, p. 412. Haygood argued that slavery was important in developing Harris County as the economic patterns established during slavery continued to exist.Linsin, p. 533. Barry A. Crouch in \\"Seeking Equality: Houston Black Women during Reconstruction\\" describes the role of women in trying to gain civil rights during the Reconstruction Era; much of the research originated from the archives of the Freedmen's Bureau. \\"Richard Allen: The Chequered Career of Houston's First Black State Legislator\\" by Merline Pitre was originally printed in an academic journal. Pitre argued that the origins of the black middle class, which she characterized as \\"articulate, talented, and manipulative\\", may be explained by studying politicians like Allen. Alwyn Barr of Texas Tech University stated that Pitre described Allen as being \\"able but ambitious\\". Since Allen never left any personal papers behind, Joseph A. Tomberlin of the Mississippi Quarterly stated that Pitre had to use \\"less satisfactory sources\\"; he argued that while the situation was not her fault, the lack of sources related directly to Allen affected the quality of her essay. =Third section= The second collection discusses the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. In \\"The Emergence of Black Business in Houston Texas: A Study of Race and Ideology, 1919‚Äì45,\\" James M. SoRelle wrote about African-American businesses and how they, in order to attract black investors and customers, appealed to racial solidarity and pride as well the idea of \\"self-help\\" within the black community. SoRelle criticized Black Bourgeoisie by E. Franklin Frazier, which had argued that the black middle class was greedy, since the book had rejected the concept of black leaders needing to respond to Jim Crow and how these leaders were committed to their race too easily. SoRelle also argued that boosterism from African-American organizations became an important part of Houston's \\"business progressivism\\". Frances Dressman, in \\"Yes, We Have No Jitneys!': Transportation Issues in Houston's Black Community, 1914‚Äì1924,\\" wrote about the rise and fall of black jitney services, which initially competed with trolley lines until the city government began shutting several of them down;Bolton, p. 197. this essay was originally published elsewhere. In particular it discusses the San Felipe Jitney Line.Haley, pp. 412-413. One primary source article is a diary entry written by Lorenzo J. Greene, a Connecticut man educated at Columbia University,Marchiafava, pp. 146-147. and an associate of Carter G. Woodson,Wooster, p. 797. who visited the city during a two-week period in September 1930 where he sold books for the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History,Bolton, pp. 197-198. in order to generate income for the institution. Greene later chaired the history department of Lincoln University. The essay documents his impression of Houston. Quintard Taylor of the University of Oregon described it as \\"a fascinating glimpse into the internal dynamics of the black community and a detailed description of the impact of the economic depression on black workers in Houston.\\"Taylor, p. 256. S. Charles Bolton of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock stated that this was a \\"cheerful account\\" despite the lack of funds held by Greene and his organization.Bolton, p. 198. Ralph A. Wooster of Lamar University described Greene's article as \\"a revealing and not always flattering picture\\" of the leadership of the city's African-American community. Louis J. Marchiafava of the Houston Public Library wrote that Greene has an \\"outsider's perspective\\".Marchiafava, p. 147. Lorenzo Hirsch of the University of New Orleans wrote that \\"Certainly Greene's positive impression of black education in Houston contrasts sharply with James M. SoRelle's analysis in a later piece.\\"Hirsch, p. 583. The other primary source article is \\"Houston's Colored Citizens: Activities and Conditions among the Negro Population in the 1920s,\\" a 1928 article written by that was published by Clifton F. Richardson in a Houston area publication, the liberal white magazine Civics. Richardson was a NAACP chapter president and the founder of the Houston Informer. This article discusses the elite of the city's black community. John H. Haley of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington stated that it was \\"a glowing assessment of black citizens of \\"Heavenly Houston,\\"Haley, p.413. using a term employed by people promoting the city.Wooster, p. 198. Taylor characterizes the two primary source articles as \\"two of the most impressive entries\\". Alwyn Barr of Texas Tech University described the Greene and Richardson sources as \\"slightly more optimistic descriptions of business and social leaders and institutions in the period.\\" =Fourth section= The final collection discusses 20th century efforts to end discrimination against black people. SoRelle discusses the discrimination in public schools, accommodations, transportation, and other publicly-used facilities; as well as police and Ku Klux Klan-related violence, between World War I and World War II, arguing that conditions were more severe than, in the words of Barr, \\"Houston's popular image of the period suggested.\\" Robert V. Haynes, in \\"Black Houstonians and the White Democratic Primary, 1920‚Äì45,\\" described the effort to end an all- white primary in the Democratic Party in the period 1920‚Äì1940, which culminated in Smith v. Allwright and the disestablishment of the said primary; this essay was originally published elsewhere. F. Kenneth Jensen wrote about 1960 and 1961 sit-ins by Houston students, from Texas Southern University, at lunch counters at a Weingartens shop. According to Jensen, this resulted in the end of several discriminatory practices. Jensen argued that the urbanization of blacks augmented their resistance against discriminatory laws.Linsin, p. 534. Haley describes the conclusion as \\"somewhat doubtful\\". Cecile E. Harrison and Alice K. Lain's piece discusses the rise and fall of Operation Breadbasket from 1966 through 1974. Robert A. Bullard wrote about contemporary issues facing black people in the working class, stating that housing difficulties were occurring with low and moderate income individuals; at the time the conditions of housing of many blacks were poor, and most blacks lived in black neighborhoods. Bullard had previously published his own book and this essay is a further explanation of his previous point. The final chapter was written by Robert Fisher, who documented the city government's resistance against government programs and the effects of privatization; the author believes that many of the city's problems resulted from excess privatization. Haley stated that Fisher perceived as Houston \\"as the epitome of the privatized city\\". Hirsch stated that the chapter has \\"some theoretical applications\\". Reception The book won the September 1993 Ottis Lock Award for the Best Book on East Texas History.\\"Black Dixie.\\" Texas A&M; University Press. Retrieved on August 9, 2016. =Book reviews= Barr wrote that the book \\"is a valuable contribution that adds diversity to a general sense of the African- American and southern urban experience\\" and that \\"the chapters generally reflect sound research and thoughtful analysis\\" even though \\"some conclusions may stir debate\\". Bolton wrote that the book \\"is an excellent example of African-American history, of urban history, and of collaborative effort.\\" Haley argued that the book demonstrated that \\"the black experience in Houston was quite similar to that in other places in the South\\"; he criticized how the book primarily used the viewpoint of elites, documented \\"only facets of the black experiences\\", and neglected the \\"experience of the black masses\\". He believed the introductions and essays \\"are imbalanced and often too narrowly focused.\\" In addition he stated the book \\"hardly touched upon\\" the issue of African-American and Hispanic and Latino relations. Hirsch concluded that while the book is \\"a helpful initial reconnaissance\\" that has \\"interesting bits of information and insights scattered throughout\\", the book does not provide any comparisons nor does it give \\"a clear overall conception\\" of the black community in Houston, and therefore there is still \\"the need for a broader, deeper, and more focused treatment.\\" Marchiafava concluded that even though it \\"is not intended to be the final word on African Americans in Houston, the book is a major contribution for its effort to fill in a major gap in the city's history.\\" Taylor praised several of the articles, saying that the ones about Slavery and the post-U.S. Civil War Reconstruction Era \\"are among the strongest in the book\\". Taylor argued that while the book did discuss failed attempts to establish a black elite in Houston, the book had not covered adequate ground on describing relations between blacks and Hispanics and Latinos, the roles of socio-civic groups such as the NAACP, churches, fraternal orders, nor the overall economic structure of black Houston. Wooster wrote that the book has \\"well written\\" essays that are \\"based upon solid research in primary and secondary materials\\" and that the book \\"is a major contribution to our understanding of urban black culture in the South.\\" He argued the book should have included ethnic composition maps and a chapter about the last quarter of the 19th century.

He lived his life as a soldier before suffering the loss of sight at which point his healing led him down the path of repentance and into the Carmelites. Lippi was beatified in 1670 after Pope Clement X approved Lippi's longstanding local 'cultus' (or popular devotion). Life Francesco Lippi was born on 3 December 1211 in Siena to the nobles Matteo Lippi and Dorotea. He spent his dissolute adolescence as a soldier that indulged in vices and his outfit captured Sarteano from the Orvientani. But in that conflict he was blinded in 1261. He offered to change his life if he was healed which, according to tradition, occurred after requesting the intercession of Saint James. He travelled on a pilgrimage to Campostella and to the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari to visit the tomb of Saint Nicholas. He also travelled to both Loreto and Rome. Lippi listened to the preaching of Ambrose Sansedoni in Siena and was resolved to live the remainder of his life as a hermit and to do penance for his earlier life; he shut himself in a small cell and remained there from 1261 to 1266. Lippi entered the Carmelites and continued to live as a hermit. He experienced visions of Jesus Christ and the Madonna as well as seeing angels and experiencing the temptations of demons. He also possessed prophetic gifts. He died on 11 December 1291. Part of his relics were relocated to a Carmelite convent in Cremona in 1341. Beatification The confirmation of the late Lippi's 'cultus' (or popular devotion) allowed for Pope Clement X to approve his beatification in 1670. His iconographical depiction includes a chain and a ball in his mouth which he used to practice silence.

The episode was written by Akela Cooper, and was directed by Charles Haid. Plot Opening quote: \\"Then he seized his left foot with both hands in such a fury that he split in two.\\" In a party celebrating the launch of a new game, Black Forest II, Brody Crawford (Quinn Franzen) is killed by a Wesen with an acid and his body is cut in half. Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby) and Wu (Reggie Lee) investigate the scene and find something written with blood in the wall: \\"Play My Game\\". Nick and Hank interrogate the head of administration of the video game, Dominick Spinner (Eric Lange) about Brody, as well as the other members, Jenna (Camille Chen) and Vicky (Beth Thompson). Suddenly, Jenna's phone rings and the voice in the other end utters the words in the wall. They track the call and discover is coming from Brody's office. They go to his office but find no one there. Instead, Brody's ID is cut and three books have the words: \\"What's\\", \\"My\\", and \\"Name\\". Meanwhile, Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) continues receiving the visions of Nick's ghost and asks Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) for help. Nick and Hank receive a tip from Spinner about Ridley Cooper, an ex-boyfriend of Jenna, before she began dating Brody. Ridley states he wasn't involved as he was playing the game during the events. He also tells them that Brody's avatar was killed the night before his death by a user named \\"Nameless\\", who also killed his avatar in the same way as his death. Renard (Sasha Roiz) receives a call from his informant, who arrives in Portland to discuss the family. Vicky is called by the killer and when Nick and Hank get there, they find her body cut in half, an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and another message in the wall: \\"Guess my name\\". Wu solves the puzzle and finds a new pattern that details the day and time. Jenna deduces that an I.T. person is responsible for her involvement in the creation of the code for the video game. While dining with his informant, Renard finds out there's an assassin in the restaurant and manages to find a bomb and throw it in the streets before detonating and killing the assassin. Nick and Hank find out they're dealing with a Fuchsteufelwild. After getting help from Spinner, Nick and Hank discover the killer is a man named Trinket Lipslums (Chris Murray). Jenna draws him out by killing his avatar in the game. Trinket is now pursued by the police and climbs to the rooftop of a building and, refusing to acknowledge he lost, jumps from the rooftop, killing himself. Juliette demands from Monroe that he shows her Aunt Marie's trailer so she can find more about her memory. Monroe then tells Nick that if she won't be allowed to see the trailer, she will leave him and Portland for good.

His efforts have been reported behind the construction of five irrigation reservoirs as well as an environmental project which included mass tree plantation and digging of wells and ponds in the Bero Block near Ranchi, covering 51 villages. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2016, for his contributions to society.  Biography  Simon Oraon was born in Khaksi Toli village, a small village under the Bero Block, around 35 km away from Ranchi, in a catholic farmer's family and had school education only up to class IV. His villagers relied heavily on rainwater for their agriculture and did farming only for a limited period every year due to scarcity of water. This is known to have prompted Oraon in building a reservoir at the footsteps of the nearby hills which he did with the assistance of his fellow villagers in 1961. Though the initial attempt and the subsequent attempt the next year did not last long, the third dam, built with the help of local authorities survived and is providing irrigation assistance to the village to the day. This was followed by two more dams at Deshbali and Jharia and several ponds in the neighbouring villages of Hariharpur, Jamtoli, Khaksitoli, Baitoli and Bhasnanda. In all, he helped construct five check dams in the region. In 1964, the villagers elected him as the Parha Raja (Chief of the tribe) and he initiated the social forestry program at his ancestral property which he continues, planting 1000 trees every year, to prevent soil erosion and depletion of water resources. He formed a 25-member village committee with the representation of all the nearby villages which administers the forestry drive. He also heads the people's movement which fights against deforestation and illegal felling of trees. His efforts are reported to have assisted in the cultivation of over 2000 acres of land, producing three crops a year and yielding 20,000 mt of vegetables annually. He served as the Prime Minister's Rural Development Fellow during 2012‚Äì14. The Government of India honored him with the civilian award of the Padma Shri in 2016.

Lea Island State Natural Area is a North Carolina State Park on the northern end of the island. The island is separated from Topsail Island to the north by New Topsail Inlet and Figure Eight Island to the South by Rich Inlet and from the mainland by Topsail Sound. The four mile long landmass was consolidated in 1998 when Old Topsail Inlet (also known as Elmore's Inlet) that had separated Lea Island and Hutaff Island (also known as Elmore's Island) closed.  History  Lea Island got its name from Joseph Hampton Lea, Sr., the owner of a prominent Hampstead seafood business who purchased the land from the North Carolina State Board of Education in the early 1950s. Hutaff Island's name came from George Hutaff, who bought the property in 1925. Lea Island was subdivided into approximately 40 lots that were offered for sale in the 1980s. Three houses were constructed on the island, but they were soon threatened by erosion due to the relentless southward migration of New Topsail inlet. The inlet has migrated more than six miles since it opened prior to 1730 and as of 2014 was still migrating southward at a rate of approximately 50 feet per year. Due to the rapid erosion and the challenges of living off-the-grid on a remote barrier island without public utilities, and no bridge or ferry service to the mainland, many landowners who had initially bought lots and planned to build homes on Lea Island abandoned the idea. By the early 2000s efforts were underway to prevent future development on Lea Island. In partnership with Audubon North Carolina, the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust started buying the remaining privately owned lots to transfer to the state. The land trust made deals with most of the owners who were willing to sell; other owners donated their lots. The acquired land was transferred to the State of North Carolina and became Lea Island State Natural Area. Audubon bought 36 acres on Lea Island in 2010. The last of the homes on Lea-Hutaff Island was destroyed by a storm in October 2015. The northern portion of Lea-Hutaff Island that was Lea Island is now mostly held by the National Audubon Society and the state government, while the Hutaff area is owned by the Hutaff family. The island is only accessible by boat. The island is also a prominent nesting spot for loggerhead turtles, Least Terns, American Oystercatchers, Piping Plovers and Clapper Rails.
