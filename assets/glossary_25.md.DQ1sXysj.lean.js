She was responsible for coining the term \\"chutney soca\\" in 1987 with her first album, entitled Chutney Soca, which included both English and Hindustani versions of the songs. She had her biggest hit the following year when her \\"(Roll Up the Tassa) Mr. Bissessar\\" was a Road March contender. She was instrumental in tassa and chutney soca finding its place in Carnival and her efforts later led to competitions such as Chutney Soca Monarch. Biography Drupatee Ramgoonai was born on Sunrees Road in Charlo Village, Penal, Saint Patrick County, Penal-Debe, Trinidad and Tobago, on 2 March 1958 into a Hindu Indian family. She started singing alongside her mother in the mandir at a young age, then went on to learn Indian classical singing from her trainer Ustad James Ramsewak, a veteran in the field.Tejaswini Niranjana, Mobilizing India: Women, Music, and Migration between India and Trinidad, Durham, North Carolina: Duke University, 2000. , p. 98.

Origins  The Élysée Montmartre was originally a ballroom inaugurated in 1807:fr:Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris where the famous Can-Can was performed among others dances during the 19th century. In 1900, the venue was damaged by fire and re-decorated. After the Second World War, it started hosting boxing matches. Notable productions The piece The Mask by Maupassant takes place in the venue. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec created several paintings here as well. From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, a wide variety of French and international performers gained notoriety at the location, including Patti Smith, Alain Souchon, and Jacques Higelin.

The female of the species, like all argonauts, creates a paper-thin eggcase that coils around the octopus much like the way a nautilus lives in its shell (hence the name paper nautilus). A. bottgeri is the smallest argonaut species. The eggcase rarely exceeds 50 mm in diameter, although exceptional specimens have been known to grow up to 67.0 mm. A. bottgeri is similar to Argonauta hians, but differs in having more pronounced ribs and prominent tubercles on the keel. The eggcase does not have winged protrusions as is sometimes the case with A. hians. It is generally darker than that of any other species, ranging in colour from ochre-yellow to almost black, although completely white specimens have been reported from South African waters. The eggcase is finely granulated and normally lacks the porcelain-like shine of other species. A. bottgeri is best known from the waters off southern and eastern Africa, although it has also been reported from other parts of the Indian Ocean and from the western Pacific Ocean. The locus classicus of A. bottgeri is Mozambique. A. bottgeri feeds primarily on pelagic molluscs, especially heteropods and pteropods, with other octopods constituting a smaller portion of the animal's diet. Females from Japanese waters have been reported to prey on the pteropod Carolina tridentata. The species is preyed on by numerous predators. A. bottgeri has been reported in the stomach contents of yellowfin tuna from the Indian Ocean. Males of this species reach sexual maturity at a mantle length (ML) of about 7 mm, presumably the maximum size attained. Females begin to secrete an eggcase at 6.5 to 7 mm ML. Female A. bottgeri as small as 11 to 13 mm ML have been reported with hectocotyli in the mantle cavity. They mature at about half the size of Argonauta argo. Eggs are usually laid when females reach 14 or 15 mm ML, although the size at which this takes place differs across the animal's range. It has been reported that the egg clusters of A. bottgeri can be clearly divided into three portions, each with eggs at a similar developmental stage. The first lies closest to the aperture of the eggcase and contains eggs at an early stage of development. The second is located in the middle of the mass and contains eggs at a later stage of development, ranging from the appearance of red eye pigmentation to the beginning of chromatophore formation. The third portion lies furthest from the aperture of the eggcase and consists of eggs with embryos that are ready to hatch, having a fully formed ink sac, chromatophores, and dark coloured eyes. Similar development has been observed in the egg masses of Argonauta nodosa from southern Australia. Egg laying is thought to occur at night and it has been suggested that the three stages of development may represent the products of three successive nights. A. bottgeri is known to cling to objects floating on the surface of the sea, including other argonauts. Chains of up to 30 argonauts of similar size have been reported. The first female in such chains usually clings to some inanimate object, while the other females hold on to the ventral part of the shell of the preceding animal. A. bottgeri is named after Oskar Boettger. The orthographic variant \\"Argonauta boettgeri\\" is sometimes encountered. A. bottgeri does not appear to have any nomenclatural synonyms. The type locality and type repository of A. bottgeri are unknown.Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda References  E. A. Smith (1887). Notes on Argonauta böttgeri. Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.

A contemporary of Little Audrey, Little Dot and Wendy the Good Little Witch, she was one of Harvey's best-known female characters during the 1960s and featured in many of the company's child-friendly comedy titles. Like many of Harvey's comic headliners, Lotta was notable for a quirky defining characteristic - in this case, an insatiable appetite giving rise to superhuman strength. Lotta stories were penned by Warren Kremer and Howard Post, and for the majority of the years that she appeared in comics, she was drawn by Sid Couchey and Dom Sileo.  Publication history  Lotta Plump first appeared in 1953 as a back-page feature in Little Dot (where she debuted with Harvey's most successful property, Richie Rich). From the outset, Lotta's large appetite was a running gag employed in virtually every story and featured prominently on the covers of her two comic titles, Little Lotta (1955-1972, 1974-76; 1992-1993) and Little Lotta in Foodland (1962-1968). A typical cover scene showed Lotta devouring a meal of gigantic proportions or performing some feat of tremendous strength. Lotta began making regular crossovers with Dot and Audrey from the beginning of the 1960s, frequently combining their peculiar foibles to either cause trouble or save the day. Guest appearances with Richie Rich and Gloria took place during the 1970s, when she and the other \\"Harvey Girls\\" were featured in Richie Rich and his Girlfriends. Little Lotta was published from 1955 to 1976, when Harvey's Richie Rich explosion took over. Lotta's book was canceled (along with Little Audrey, Little Dot, and Wendy), after 120 issues (issue #121 was advertised, but never issued). Lotta remained a supporting feature in the back of Richie Rich books until Harvey's demise in 1982. Upon Harvey's return in 1986, a proposed idea to have Lotta return as the drummer of a rock band with Little Audrey on guitar and Little Dot on vocals was shelved. So was an idea of having the three appear as teenagers and have adventures similar to Archie.  Character  Far from being the \\"unpopular fat kid\\" stereotype represented in other popular media (such as her contemporary Tubby in Little Lulu) Lotta was depicted as friendly, kind-hearted and always ready to use her tremendous strength for what she deemed as good. She suffers her share of bullying, but any tormentors quickly regret provoking her wrath. In a sense, Lotta's storylines fulfill two very common childhood fantasies: the satisfaction of visceral desires (eating everything in sight) and freedom through physical power. Little Lotta always maintains a positive attitude about herself. Lotta lives in the fictional town of Bonnie Dell, a \\"timeless\\" picket-fence suburb existing in the same world as several other Harvey characters (although in many stories it is simply called Harveyville). She has a boyfriend named Gerald, who in many ways is Lotta's opposite. He is a shy, diminutive boy with glasses, and he is not very strong. Lotta and Gerald have many adventures together and frequently dress up to imitate their favorite comic book hero, Flying Man. When dressed up, Lotta becomes \\"Leaping Lotta\\". In several stories, Lotta expressed an ambition to become a police officer even though passing the physical was an impossibility.  In popular culture  *A Little Lotta comic book was used as a plot device on Everybody Loves Raymond in 2000 (season 4, episode 17). *Lotta appears as a character on Baby Huey's Great Easter Adventure. *Little Lotta was referenced in the animated TV series Family Guy in season 15 episode 4, \\"Inside Family Guy\\", in which Peter dresses up as Little Lotta to get paid having his picture taken pictures with tourists on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. *Little Lotta is one of the three main characters in the Netflix original series Harvey Street Kids and is voiced by Lauren Lapkus. Gerald also appears in the series. The show explains that, prior to a growth spurt, Lotta was extremely small, but grew to be taller than the other children in the neighborhood. This version still possesses super- strength, and is a lover of animals. She is also Jewish in this version as the fourth season episode \\"Miracle on Harvey Street\\" shows Lotta celebrating Hanukkah.

During his footballing career he made a combined total of over 500 appearances. He is currently u23 manager at Middlesbrough F.C. Playing career =Newcastle United= Paul Stephenson was born in Wallsend. He started his career as an apprentice at Newcastle United in the same youth team that brought through the likes of Paul Gascoigne. He was by capped by England at youth level in 1986. He made his debut at the age of 17 and went on to make 63 starts and four substitute appearances for the club. =Millwall= In 1988, Stephenson was sold to Millwall for a fee of around £300,000. He spent his first four seasons playing regularly for the Lions in the same team as the likes of Teddy Sheringham and Tony Cascarino. However, after the arrival of new manager Mick McCarthy, Stephenson's first-team opportunities were limited and he found himself being loaned to Gillingham, for whom he made 12 league starts and scored two goals. Stephenson returned to Millwall but he failed to force his way back into the first team. While at Millwall, Stephenson made a total of 98 league appearances and scored sixgoals. =Brentford & York= Midway through the 1993–94 season, Stephenson was sold to Brentford for £30,000. During his two- and-a-half seasons at Griffin Park, Stephenson played regularly and made 70 appearances for the club. However, he decided to move back up north and joined York City for £35,000, which the then-York manager Alan Little has cited as a 'bargain'. Stephenson's first season at the club was disrupted by two severe injuries – a broken arm and hairline fracture of the leg. During his three seasons at Bootham Crescent, Stephenson established himself as York's first choice right winger and he made just under 100 appearances for the club, scoring five times. Little reluctantly placed him on the transfer list along with several other first-team players in order to raise much-needed funds before his contract ran out. Hartlepool, along with his former club Brentford, both made offers, but Little delayed the transfer in order to try and use the winger to help aid York's play-off bid. York failed to make the play-offs, however, and Stephenson took the opportunity to move closer to his Newcastle roots and joined Hartlepool in March 1998. =Hartlepool= He made his Hartlepool debut on 18 April against Mansfield Town. After the dismissal of Mick Tait and the arrival of a new manager in the form of Chris Turner, Stephenson's future at the club looked uncertain and he was rumoured to be on his way out as he struggled to force his way into Turner's side and he handed in a transfer request. During the final game of the season, against Southend United, Stephenson came off the bench and scored. During Stephenson's second season at the club, he was moved into the centre of midfield. After his performances during the 1999–2000 season, he was named Hartlepool Player of the Year. He made his final appearance for Pools against Cheltenham Town in the play-off semi-final second leg, in which he missed a penalty in the deciding shootout. Stephenson failed to play a single game in the following season and, on 25 March 2003, he announced his retirement. Coaching career =Hartlepool and Norwich= After Stephenson's retirement, he immediately joined the coaching staff at Hartlepool and became an assistant youth-team coach. Following Martin Scott's promotion to the assistant manager's position, Stephenson was made the main youth team coach. Stephenson guided the youth team to victory in the Under 19s section of the Dallas Cup. Towards the end of the 2005–06 season, Stephenson was appointed as Hartlepool's caretaker manager after the dismissal of Scott. His first game in charge was a goalless draw against Rotherham. In his second game he managed to guide the team to a single-goal victory over Chesterfield. He was undefeated in his first five games in charge. However, Hartlepool slipped back into the relegation zone and were eventually relegated on the last day of the season. Stephenson stated that he did not want to take over as manager and wanted to remain a coach, and he returned to his job as youth team coach. Upon the arrival of new manager Glenn Roeder at Norwich, and his decision to build his own backroom staff, Stephenson was offered the job of first-team coach in early November 2007. Despite some trouble with the Hartlepool chairman regarding compensation, Roeder was ultimately successful with the appointment, and Stephenson commenced work with the Canaries two months later. =Huddersfield Town= Following Roeder's departure in 2009, Stephenson left the club and joined Roeder's assistant, Lee Clark, as Development Coach at Football League One side Huddersfield Town. On 11 November 2010 it was officially announced he would be the first-team coach at the Terriers. He left the club in the wake of the sacking of Clark in February 2012.Huddersfield Town chairman Dean Hoyle on why Lee Clark was sacked: \\"I had lost faith\\" Huddersfield Examiner (Retrieved: 26 August 2012) =Blackpool= Stephenson was reunited with Lee Clark in December 2014 when he became First-Team Coach at Blackpool.

Area Ballymount is divided by the M50 motorway. On the west side of the divide is the more residential area of Kingswood, and most of the industrial land is on the east. Companies based in Ballymount include Smurfit, Virgin Media Television, DHL, Johnson Brothers, and the bus depot of Go-Ahead Ireland. History In Ballymount Park, on the western boundary of Ballymount, contains the ruins of Ballymount castle, also known as Kingswood Castle.https://www.dublinsoutdoors.ie/know/our-parks/ballymount-park/ The castle was built in 1622 by Sir William Parsons. The original name give to the area was Bellamount (\\"beautiful mount\\") in reference to the pre-existing mound (Bronze Age grave). In the early 18th century Ballymount Great was home to Mr John Butler, son of Sir Toby Butler, Solicitor General for Ireland to King James II. It is John Butler who is reputed to have built the folly (sham ruin) for his daughter's wedding day. It was never a fully built structure but as the name implies a fake ruin. The castle was the subject of a 1767 drawing by Gabriel Beranger.https://edmooneyphoto.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/ballymount- castle/ At the end of the 18th century the lands of Garranstown and Kingswood merged under the ownership of the Cullen family. The house retained the name Whitehall given to it by Mr Theo White.

He has also performed with punk rock band Rancid, both live and in the studio. He has released four solo acoustic albums and continues to tour and record worldwide. Ruggiero is known primarily as a singer and organist, although he also plays piano, bass, banjo, cigar box guitar, guitar, harmonica and percussion. Ruggiero is known for his deep distinct Bronx accent. His lyrics usually follow several themes, including the apocalypse, dark humor, political distrust, paranoia, murder, irony, romance and loneliness. His songs have ranged from narrative ballads to whimsical tunes inspired by Beat generation poets, authors and songwriters, including Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and John Lennon. Biography American singer-songwriter, pianist and producer Victor \\"Vic\\" Ruggiero started playing piano by ear as a fifth grader and sang with the Metropolitan Opera at age 12. While attending Ardsley High School in 1986, he played in a hardcore group Sic & Mad fronted by his friend Happy, which is how he met Marcus Geard and Ara Babajian who would later become the bass and drummer behind the Slackers. Sic & Mad played a unique cocktail of art-punk, avant-garde, New York hardcore, hip-hop, reggae, psychedelia and ska music. Starting in 1992, The Slackers started as a trio (Vic, Luis, Marcus) and extension of Sic & Mad. Early incarnations of the group were sometimes billed as The Redlights. Later, TJ joined the group on second guitar, Marq on vocals and after 2 years, Dave and Jeremy joined as the first official horn section on tenor sax and trumpet, respectively. Glen joined on trombone/vocals in October 1997 and Ara became the band's drummer in 2001. Vic soon became the focal point of The Slackers, also making appearances with the Stubborn All- Stars, Rancid and a host of other groups. In the late 1990s, he began making his own records and released some of these under his own label, Special Potato Records. Ruggiero has recorded several solo albums on which he plays guitar, harmonica, percussion and sings: To Live in Shame/Understanding New Jersey, Alive at the Ladybug House, Hamburguru (2007), Something In My Blind Spot (2008), On the Rag Time (2009), Songs for Clandestine Lovers (2009). Collaborations with Zoot 16GB (Meatball and Sushi Party, 2009), Kepi Ghoulie (The New Dark Ages, 2009) and wrote songs for the book/CD production, Do Not Feed The Cats in Iraq (2010) with Phil Nerges. He has worked as the producer behind a number of releases using Special Potatoe Records as the distribution outlet for many of these early works. Ruggiero's production style has a distinctively raw sound quality to it: by not erasing sounds that would traditionally be unwanted in a recording, such as doors closing or musicians cuing each other, his productions capture a live-band atmosphere more closely. Ruggiero has also been responsible for the production of releases from European ska artists, including Mr T Bone and The Moon Invaders and has performed with Shane and the Ashes, The Phenomenauts and The Forthrites. =Special Potato= Special Potato Records began in New York during the early 1990s. The label (sometimes spelled \\"special Potatoe\\") began as the primary outlet for self-released albums and those featuring members or alumni of The Slackers. After the initial release of a Nods record, followed by a solo record, over time, Special Potato became the calling card for distribution of Ruggiero's early works and continues to release albums. An innovative solo artist and collaborator, Ruggiero has written, recorded and produced dozens of albums that have introduced rocksteady, ska and reggae to younger generations of listeners. His solo albums in particular are influenced by early rock n roll, doo-wop, blues and punk rock. The Slackers Ruggiero is best known as the front man of the Third Wave Ska and Ska band The Slackers (1992–present). Early incarnations of the band were billed under The Nods, The Redlights and Sic & Mad. Smashing stereotypes of \\"Ska\\" as happy, uptempo, and shallow music, New York City's ska revolutionaries, the Slackers, play with an aggressive edge. In 1996, the New York Times declared the Slackers to be part of \\"the sound of New York\\". Alternative Nation stated that their music is \\"protest music made for dim, sweaty basements, The Slackers would sound at home supporting Rancid as well as some grizzled New Orleans electric blues trio.\\" The LA Weekly wrote about, \\"their unfettered energy, unerring skankability, and playful anger.\\" The band is known for releases featuring reggae legends like The Congos, Glen Adams of the Upsetters, Cornell Campbell and Doreen Schaeffer. In addition to these collaborative works, over the years, they have also released a dub record, collaboration with DJ Boss Harmony (who arranged and refiltered tracks), compilation of forgotten tracks, alternate versions, and remakes from the band's recording vaults. The band has also put out 3 live albums; Live at Ernestos (2000), Upsetting Ernestos (2005), Slack in Japan (2005). Since their start in 1992, the band has released two DVDs; The Slackers: A Documentary (2007) and Live at the Flamingo Cantina (2009). Solo albums It didn't take long for Ruggiero to get his solo career started during breaks from The Slackers. A multi-instrumentalist and pioneering producer, the New York-based singer-songwriter continues to astound audiences with his trademark vocal chops, command of keys and edgy brand of bluesy rock n roll as a one-man band. When on the road by himself, Ruggiero primarily plays guitar, harmonica and percussion. Ruggiero has released several acoustic solo albums in the U.S., including Understanding New Jersey & Living in Sin, Alive at the Ladybug House, On the Rag Time, Something in My Blindspot and THIS Two songs on the latter (\\"Lonely Nites\\" and \\"Innocent Girl\\") were re- recorded in July 2007 for the album Something in My Blindspot. This album was recorded in Berlin and released on February 15, 2008 by German label 'Moanin'. The track \\"Animales\\" also appears on the album, Alive at the Ladybug House. In \\"Something in My Blindspot\\", Ruggiero sings and plays guitar, bass, organ, piano and banjo. Lisa Müller from the German ska/swing band Black Cat Zoot sings on four songs. The album also features a brass band, Fanfara Kalashnikov. Drums are played by Andrei Kluge from the ska band Rolando Random & The Young Soul Rebels. Hamburguru is a solo album that has only been released in Japan by the Ska in the World label. Some songs on the album have been previously released on the demo entitled Top Secret Bounty and Clues. On Hamburguru, he plays in his typical fashion as a \\"one man band\\" on vocals, guitar, harmonica, kick drum and hi-hat. THIS (album) is a Hi-Fidelity recording of fan-favorites, released on the Unison Music label. (UM59) Recorded and Produced by Bruce Witkin and Ryan Dorn at the Unison Music studio in Los Angeles. Vic performs the keyboards, guitars, mandolin, accordion, and harmonica. Bass performed by Bruce Witkin and Drums performed by Rob Klonel. Acoustic guitar on \\"Oklahoma\\" by Mitch Goodman. Ruggiero maintains a solo touring schedule, he collaborated with The Forthrights and The Ashes as well as acoustic musicians and singers, including Chris Murray, Kepi Ghoulie, Lisa Müller and Maddie Ruthless on live and studio recordings. Ruggiero's music is primarily distributed by Asian Man Records, Hellcat Records, Ska in the World, Moanin' Music and Whatevski and he continues to tour and release new material. Ruggiero is best known for his working-class roots, political radicalism, fiery personality and unique style of ska, punk rock, blues and rock music. He has played in bands like The Nods, SKAndalous All-Stars, Stubborn All-Stars, The Silencers, Da Whole Thing, David Hillyard and the Rocksteady 7, Crazy Baldhead Sound System, Victor Rice Octet, Sic & Mad, Tremoflex9000 and more. His guest appearances include famous artists like Rancid, The Transplants or Roger Miret and the Disasters. He has been seen playing many different kinds of organs, such as Roland VK-7, Roland VK-8 and Roland VK-09, Korg CX-3, Hammond XB-1G, Hammond XK-2, Rheem Mark 7 as well as a Rhodes Piano.

Fort Osage (also known as Fort Clark or Fort Sibley) was an early 19th-century factory trading post system run by the United States Government, on the American frontier being located in present-day Sibley, Missouri. The Treaty of Fort Clark was signed with certain members of the Osage Nation in 1808 calling for the creation of Fort Osage. It was one of three forts established by the U.S. Army to establish control over the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase territories. Fort Madison in SE Iowa was built to control trade and pacify Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. Fort Belle Fontaine near St. Louis controlled the mouth of the Missouri.Prucha, Francis P. (1964) A Guide to the Military Posts of the United States 1789–1895.

The fort ceased operations in the 1820s as the Osage in subsequent treaties ceded the rest of their land in Missouri. A replica of the fort was rebuilt on the site between 1948 and 1961. The Fort Osage school district (including Fort Osage High School), which serves northeast Independence and the surrounding area, was named after it. Background During their famous ascent up the Missouri River to find the Northwest Passage, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark noted the spot in June 1804, as they camped for the night just across the river: > high commanding position, more than 70 feet above high-water mark, and > overlooking the river, which is here but of little depth...Fort Osage – > National Park Service. Cr.nps.gov. Retrieved on 2013-08-28. In the same year Pierre Chouteau of the Chouteau fur trading family and an agent for the Osage took Osage chiefs to meet President Thomas Jefferson who promised to build them a trading post. Previously Jefferson promoted his plan of expanding Federal trading posts on the frontier as means to remove the harmful influence of individual merchants by \\"undersell[ing] private traders\\" to make them withdraw from borderlands and \\"earn the good will of the Indians\\".Jefferson, Thomas, \\"Trade,\\" 18 Jan. 1803, American State Papers: Indian Affairs (Washington, D.C., 1832), Vol. 1: 684. =Foundation= William Clark led a team in September 1808 back to the site to begin construction of Fort Osage. In November 1808 Pierre Chouteau negotiated the Treaty of Fort Clark with certain members of the Osage Nation, for the fort to be built for the protection of the Osage.

In exchange for access to the trading post, the attending Osage agreed to cede all of their lands east of the fort in Louisiana Territory. This effectively left them with a small band of territory on the extreme western border of Missouri. The Great Osage were to receive $1,000 and the Little Osage were to get $500. Operations The fort was officially christened \\"Fort Osage\\" by Captain Eli Clemson who was in charge of the military garrison at Fort Osage from 1808 until it was evacuated in 1813. It has also been informally referred to as \\"Fort Clark\\" in honor of William Clark who was in charge of Indian Affairs. It was one of the first United States military installations in Louisiana Territory and became a major stopping point for visitors traveling the Missouri. Daniel Boone was to visit it in 1814, at the age of 81, while on one of his last hunting trips. Sacagawea and her husband, Toussaint Charbonneau, also stayed at the fort on their way back north to Dakota Territory. Fort Osage was abandoned in June 1813 during the War of 1812 because it was not considered to be under threat. Since most of the war's fighting was further east and north, the soldiers there were transferred to different locations. After the war the fort was reoccupied in 1815.Rodriguez, Junius P. (2002) The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia, Clio, Santa Barbara, CA, p. 270, . Fort Osage was for many years a productive location, with the first Factor George C. Sibley reporting prosperous trade with the Osage was due to goods being sold \\"at prices less than half what the traders extort from them...\\"Isenberg, Andrew C. \\"The Market Revolution in the Borderlands: George Champlin Sibley in Missouri and New Mexico, 1808-1826.\\" Journal of the Early Republic 21, No. 3 (2001), pp. 445-465. =Abandonment= The end of the War of 1812 and the Adams–Onís Treaty removed the threat of Spanish or British backed Indigenous campaigns against the United States throughout the Louisiana Purchase. As the Osage ceded more and more of their land a new trading post at Fort Scott, Kansas was established closer to the ancestral villages near the headwaters of the Osage River near Nevada, Missouri. Fort Osage formally was closed in 1822 but remained a landmark on the Santa Fe Trail and a transit point for supplies going north. However, by 1836 it had been totally obliterated with its pre-cut wood used by local settlers for building houses and barns. The factory house was the last remaining structure, but burned to the ground, leaving only the rock foundation. Fort Osage National Historic Landmark Archaeologists rediscovered the foundations of Fort Osage in the 1940s. The station was rebuilt to portray Fort Osage as it was in 1812 by using the preserved surveys created by William Clark and others, making restoration to exact specifications possible. The rebuilt post is known as Fort Osage National Historic Landmark and is owned and operated by the Jackson County Parks and Recreation. It is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday from 9:00am to 4:30pm year round. The Fort Osage Education Center, opened in November 2007, contains exhibits about the site's geology, 19th century natural history, the Hopewell and Osage native cultures, Lewis and Clark, Fort Osage and the Missouri River. In addition, the location has living history demonstrations about early 19th century military and civilian life.

In the United States, this concept was demonstrated by commissions and appointments during the American Civil War, in both the Union and the Confederacy. History =American Civil War= Most of the top generals on the Union and Confederate sides were graduates of West Point and were career military officers. In addition to military training, many of them had battlefield experience gained during the Mexican–American War or American Indian wars, such as the Third Seminole War in Florida. Due to the necessity of raising large-scale citizen armies, both presidents, Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, for various reasons appointed a number of the so- called political generals. Some of them, such as John A. Logan on the Union side, or Richard Taylor on the Confederate, developed into competent military leaders and were respected by their subordinates and superiors alike. Others turned out to be \\"disastrously incompetent.\\"James M. McPherson. Generals in Politics\\", The New York Times Review of Books, March 28, 1991. Appeasement of political groups The most important reason for appointing political generals was to appease important blocs of voters. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln used such appointments as a way to get the support of moderate Democrats for the war and for his administration (\\"War Democrats\\"). The first three volunteer generals whom Lincoln appointed, John Adams Dix, Nathaniel Prentice Banks and Benjamin F. Butler, were all Democrats. They were the three most senior major generals in the Union Army. Republicans were also appointed, including Richard James Oglesby of Illinois. Geopolitical Other promotions were used to gain the support of the specific group they represented, especially in cases of foreign immigrants. One of the largest ethnic groups in the U.S. at the time was relatively recent German immigrants, who had arrived in the late 1840s and early 1850s, after the revolutions in German principalities. Prominent ethnic German civilian leaders, such as Franz Sigel and Carl Schurz, both of whose last military experience prior to the Civil War was fighting on the losing side of the 1848 revolutions in Germany, were appointed to high rank for their usefulness in rallying fellow immigrants to the cause. Two prominent Irish immigrants were also given promotions, as many Irish had arrived following the famines in Ireland. Thomas F. Meagher and Michael Corcoran were promoted, who prior to the war had been a captain and a colonel, respectively, in the New York State Militia. Meagher attempted to resign in December 1863. Corcoran died and Meagher's resignation was revoked to keep at least one Irishman in command. Other officers were highly successful in their attempts to rally large numbers of troops, whether they were native born or foreign born. For instance, Daniel Sickles recruited large numbers of troops from New York. Border states The Confederacy alsappointed numerous political generals, for largely the same reasons. They also used many such appointments to influence the Confederate sympathizers in the border states, which had not seceded from the union. Former Vice President John C. Breckinridge was appointed as a general in the hopes that he would inspire the citizens of Kentucky to join the Confederate Army. Former Governor Sterling Price served a similar function with regards to Missouri. Other Another reason for the appointment of political generals during the American Civil War was the great expansion of the number of men in each army and the large number of volunteer soldiers. Men who were prominent civilian leaders, such as businessmen, lawyers and politicians, were chosen to continue their leadership in command of a volunteer regiment. Evaluation Ezra J. Warner noted that during the American Civil War, a large number of political generals, including Sigel and Banks for the Union and Breckinridge for the Confederacy, were undoubtedly popular with their men, largely because of their ties to the specific groups they represented.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964. . pp. xv-xvi However, the vast majority were considered incompetent due to their being essentially amateur soldiers with no prior training or knowledge. This was a particularly large problem for the Union, where such generals were typically given fairly important commands. Brooks D. Simpson claimed that misdeeds of three particular political general on the Union side, Butler, Banks, and Sigel, \\"contributed to a military situation in the summer of 1864 where the Northern public, anticipating decisive victory with Grant in command, began to wonder whether it was worth it to continue the struggle—something on voters' minds as they pondered whether to give Honest Abe another four years in office. Perhaps Lincoln would have been wiser to dismiss these three men and risk whatever short-term damage his actions might have caused.\\"Simpson, Brooks D. Lincoln and his political generals. Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association, Volume 21, Issue 1, Winter 2000, pp. 63-77. ISSN 0898-4212 Addressing the phenomenon of the Union political generals, Thomas Joseph Goss wrote that, \\"Though much contemporary and historical attention has been placed upon these amateur commanders in the field and highlights their numerous tactical shortcomings, their assignment patterns demonstrate that political factors outweighed any military criteria in the administration's judgment of their success. For the Lincoln administration, the risk of these tactical setbacks were exceeded by the political support amassed every day these popular figures were in uniform, revealing how political generals and their West Point peers were judged using different standards based on distinct calculations of political gain and military effectiveness.\\" Goss, Thomas J. The War Within the Union High Command: Politics and Generalship During the Civil War. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2003. David Work made a cross-section selection of Union political generals appointed by Lincoln, eight Republicans and eight Democrats, including Francis Preston Blair, Jr., John Adams Dix, John A. Logan, and James S. Wadsworth, among others, and scrutinized their performances during the war. He came to a conclusion that Lincoln's appointments were mostly successful as they cemented the Union and did not result in critical or unrecoverable battlefield failures. In addition, all Lincoln's appointees, even including such controversial figures as Nathaniel P. Banks, Franz Sigel, and Benjamin F. Butler, demonstrated good results as logistical, recruitment and political managers in the war tumultuous times.Work, David. Lincoln's Political Generals. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009. Benton R. Patterson emphasized that Union political generals who understood their shortcomings regarding military education and experience, i.e., former congressman John A. Logan, who rose through the war from a regiment commander to the commanding general of the Army of the Tennessee, did rather well; some, who thought that common sense, practicality and life experience are enough to wage a war, i.e., Major General Nathaniel Banks, wrought havoc on the battlefield causing unnecessary loss of lives. Patterson cited Major General Henry Halleck, a West-Pointer, who wrote in April 1864 to General William Tecumseh Sherman commenting on Banks exploits in Louisiana, \\"It seems but little better than murder to give important commands to such a man as Banks, Butler, McClernand, Sigel, and Lew Wallace, and yet it seems impossible to prevent it.\\"Patterson, Benton R. Lincoln's Political Generals: The Battlefield Performance of Seven Controversial Appointees. Jefferson, North Carolina, Mcfarland Publishers, 2014. To all political generals Patterson attributed a tendency of insubordination, as they frequently used their political connections to overwrite particular orders from their superiors. In addition, several generals, including Logan and Blair, left their commands to take part in the 1864 presidential campaign on behalf of Lincoln to the displeasure of professional soldiers. Lincoln as commander-in-chief experienced problems not only with political generals, but with professional West-Pointers as well, as they all were unable to realize on the battlefield the decisive Union's advantage regarding manpower and military resources until Ulysses S. Grant became the general-in-chief in March 1864. Despite all of that, Lincoln, who possessed a limited military background as a captain of a militia during the Black Hawk War,Lincoln as Commander in Chief: A self-taught strategist with no combat experience, Abraham Lincoln saw the path to victory more clearly than his generals, The Smithsonian, January 2009. did not succumb to a temptation to become involved in a war on a tactical level, instead, as James M. McPherson put it, he chose to persist \\"through a terrible ordeal of defeats and disappointments\\".McPherson, James M. Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln As Commander in Chief. New York: Penguin Press, 2008, p. 8. On the other side, President Jefferson Davis, who was a West Point graduate, served competently as a regimental commander during the Mexican War, and was an able United States Secretary of War under Franklin Pierce in 1853–1857, intervened frequently into the conduct of war below strategic level and made appointments based on political necessity and personal attachments; these war-making approaches did not serve him well.Woodworth, Steven E. Jefferson Davis and His Generals: The Failure of Confederate Command in the West. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1990. North Korea * Kim Kyong- hui was made a general of the Korean People's Army in September 2010, despite having little military experience beforehand. United States =List of prominent political generals= The following is a partial list of some of the more prominent political generals on both sides, and a brief sketch of their war service. War of 1812 *Henry Dearborn, former Secretary of War (1801–1809), was appointed as Senior Officer of the US Army in 1812. Despite his largely ineffective command, he continued serving until the war ended in 1815. *Stephen van Rensselaer, candidate for Governor of New York, commanded American forces at the Battle of Queenston Heights Mexican–American War *James Pinckney Henderson was the incumbent governor of Texas who was granted permission from the state legislature to personally lead Texas troops in the field with the rank of major general. Henderson led the so-called \\"Texas Division\\" at the Battle of Monterrey. *Joseph Lane, an Indiana Democrat, gained a reputation as \\"Rough and Ready No. 2\\", reminiscent of Zachary Taylor's nickname. *Franklin Pierce was a politician from New Hampshire who had some notable military skills. He sustained a wound at the Battle of Churubusco and, due to the loss of blood, fainted on the field. This incident was described by his political rivals as cowardice, but was not enough to keep him from attaining the Presidency. *John A. Quitman was a judge and former governor of Mississippi who served as a brigade commander under Zachary Taylor and as a division commander under Winfield Scott. Later in the war, he also served as the military governor of Mexico City. American Civil War =Union= *Nathaniel Prentice Banks, former Governor of Massachusetts, held numerous commands during the war. He commanded the original V Corps (later XII Corps) at First Winchester, and also fought without distinction at Cedar Mountain and Second Bull Run as part of the Army of Virginia. He was transferred to the Department of the Gulf, and took part in the capture of Port Hudson, as well as the Red River Campaign. After that disastrous campaign, he was relieved of command. *Francis P. Blair, Jr., Congressman from Missouri who aided Union efforts early in the war to save his state for the Union. He became a major general in the Union Army and eventually rose to become a corps commander. He enjoyed the confidence of Sherman, who was generally skeptical of political generals. While most politicians either resigned their seat in Congress or resigned their military commission, Blair retained his seat in Congress while still serving in the field. His brother was Montgomery Blair, who was Postmaster General in Lincoln's Cabinet. *Benjamin Franklin Butler, State Senator from Massachusetts and Brigadier General in the Massachusetts militia. He lost the war's first land battle at Big Bethel on July 1, 1861, and was later put in charge of the Department of the Gulf, governing the captured New Orleans with strict discipline (and earning the derogatory nickname \\"Spoons\\" for his alleged habit of pilfering from Confederate homes). He led the Army of the James during the failed Bermuda Hundred Campaign, the Siege of Petersburg, and at Fort Fisher. After the latter, he was relieved of his command. He was later elected Governor of Massachusetts. *James A. Garfield, an Ohio State Senator, rose to the rank of major general of volunteers. He served as a brigade commander in the Western Theater and was also chief of staff to William Rosecrans, before being elected to congress in the middle of the war, eventually becoming President of the United States in 1881. *Joseph Holt, former Postmaster General under James Buchanan. He was appointed as Judge Advocate General of the Army by Lincoln, and later served as chief prosecutor during his assassination trial. *John A. Logan, Congressman from Illinois, served as a brigade and division commander in the Western Theater under Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. Upon the death of James B. McPherson at Atlanta, Logan briefly rose to command of the famed Army of the Tennessee. Although Logan was generally a successful leader, Sherman elected not to keep a non-West Pointer in command of the army and replaced him with Oliver O. Howard, instead placing Logan in command of a corps. After the war, Logan returned to politics as a Republican. *John Alexander McClernand, Congressman from Illinois, served in the Western Theater, taking part in the battles of Fort Donelson and Shiloh, and led the Army of the Mississippi against Fort Hindman (Arkansas Post) in 1863 (as part of the Vicksburg Campaign), as well as leading XIII Corps during the Siege of Vicksburg and the Red River Campaign. He was poorly regarded by his peers and frequently quarreled with Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. *John McAuley Palmer, Illinois state legislator, Republican party organizer, and Congressional candidate (he was defeated by McClernand), served in the Western Theater in command of a Division in the XIV Corps and later the XIV Corps itself. In these capacities, he fought in the battles of Stones River, Chickamauga and Chattanooga. Late in the war, he had a controversial stint as military governor of Kentucky. In postbellum life, he served as Illinois governor and Senator. *Alexander Schimmelfennig, a Prussian veteran who helped co-ordinate the unsuccessful defence of the Rhineland during the Revolution of 1848. Wounded twice at the Battle of Rinnthal, he escaped to Switzerland before the Prussian authorities could capture him but was tried in absentia and sentenced to death. He fled to Paris, London, and finally to the United States, joining many other German \\"Forty-Eighters\\" who were later to fight with the Union such as Louis Blenker, Adolph von Steinwehr, and Carl Schurz. When, in 1862, Lincoln proposed to appoint Schimmelfennig to the command of a brigade, Secretary of War Stanton protested that there were better qualified officers available. 'His name,' Lincoln replied, '\\"will make up for any difference there may be\\", and he walked away repeating Schimmelfennig's name with a chuckle.'McPherson, James M., Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution New York: Oxford University Press, 1991. . p. 71 Schimmelfennig's brigade suffered high losses at the Battle of Gettysburg, where hundreds of men were taken prisoner by the Confederates after becoming confused in the narrow streets of the town: Schimmelfennig himself was forced to hide in a culvert and in a shed to avoid capture. He rejoined his troops several days after the battle, to the surprise of many who assumed he had been killed. He subsequently contracted both malaria and tuberculosis during Sherman's March to the Sea, the latter of which led to his death shortly after the end of the war. *Daniel Sickles, the infamous New York Congressman who had been tried (and acquitted) for the murder of Philip Barton Key II, served as a brigade and division commander for the first two years of the war. He assumed command of the III Corps, Army of the Potomac in early 1863, leading it at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. At the latter, his unauthorized maneuver of his corps into the Peach Orchard nearly caused the destruction of the Union Army. Sickles lost his leg at this battle and, although he was never officially censured for his action, never again held a field command. After the war, he served as a diplomat and played a key role in establishing national battlefield parks, including at Gettysburg. *Franz Sigel, a German émigré who led, at various times, a division in the Department of Missouri, XI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and the Department of West Virginia. Though a military academy graduate and former officer in both Baden's army and, later, its revolutionary forces, significant military success evaded him in Europe. As a revolutionary colonel, he had seen his command annihilated by the Prussians at Freiburg in 1848. In 1849, he was briefly Secretary of War and commander-in-chief of the doomed revolutionary republican government of Baden, but then needed to resign the post after being wounded in a skirmish. As an American general, Sigel was almost universally regarded as an incompetent, and was alleged to have fled from the Battle of New Market, where he was overall commander. He was, however, extremely popular with his German recruits, who shouted the slogan, \\"I fights mit Sigel!\\" He provided important recruiting services for the Union. *Lew Wallace, formerly of the Indiana State Legislature, fought most famously at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and the Monocacy, the \\"Battle That Saved Washington\\", in July 1864. After the war Wallace became Governor of New Mexico Territory, wrote the novel Ben-Hur, and served as a U.S. diplomat. His previous military experience had been serving as a volunteer lieutenant during the Mexican–American War. =Confederate= *William Barksdale, a \\"Fire-Eater\\" and former congressman from Mississippi, led a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia during the first two years of the war, until his death at Gettysburg. *Milledge L. Bonham, a former US congressman and Confederate congressman from South Carolina, led a brigade in the Confederate Army of the Potomac until being elected governor of his home state. After his service as governor, he rejoined the Confederate Army and served in the Carolinas Campaign. *John C. Breckinridge, former vice president under James Buchanan, led various brigade and division commands in the Western Theater. He quarreled often with Braxton Bragg. He served ably at Shiloh and Stones River, and also defeated Franz Sigel (see above) at the Battle of New Market in May 1864. He briefly became the Confederate secretary of war in 1865. *Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb, a Confederate congressman from Georgia and brother of former governor and Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb, who also served as a general in the Confederate army. Cobb commanded a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia, and became most famous for his defense of Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg, where he was killed in action. *John B. Floyd, former Governor of Virginia and Secretary of War under James Buchanan. He led state militia forces opposing Union operations in western Virginia in 1861, and played a major part in the Fort Donelson fiasco (see Gideon Pillow, below). After that battle, he was relegated to command of Virginia State Guard troops; he died in 1863. *James L. Kemper, was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1853 and became speaker of that body in 1861. Served as a brigade commander under George Pickett. Was wounded and captured during Pickett's Charge. After the war, was elected as the 37th Governor of Virginia. *Gideon Pillow, a general of the Mexican–American War and prominent power in the pre-war Democratic Party. Although he opposed secession, he ultimately went south and accepted a commission. He is most widely known for fleeing (along with John B. Floyd) from Fort Donelson in February 1862, leaving the hapless third-in-command, Simon Bolivar Buckner, and the fort's 15,000-man garrison to surrender to Union forces under U.S. Grant while they saved themselves. Commanding a brigade at Stones River, he was allegedly found by division commander Breckinridge to have been cowering behind a tree as his men went into action. After that, he never held another field command. *Leonidas Polk, the Episcopal bishop of Louisiana and cousin of former president James K. Polk, became the third most senior lieutenant general despite his lack of military experience, primarily due to a close friendship with President Jefferson Davis. In 1861, he led the failed invasion of neutral Kentucky, causing the state to side with the Union. He later commanded a corps in the Army of Tennessee and was killed in the Battle of Marietta. *Sterling Price, a former US congressman (March 4, 1845 – August 12, 1846) and Governor of Missouri (January 3, 1853 – January 5, 1867)Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 440 who was initially opposed to secession but ultimately sided with the Confederacy, led the Missouri State Guard in the 1861 Confederate invasion of the state. He was the Confederate commander at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, and served without distinction at Pea Ridge. He led an unsuccessful invasion of Missouri in 1864, which inadvertently but effectively secured Missouri and Arkansas for the Union. *William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith, former congressman and governor from Virginia, who was the oldest Confederate field commander. Despite having no previous military experience, he served as a brigade commander at the battles of Antietam, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. After again being elected governor of Virginia in 1863, he occasionally commanded troops defending Richmond. He was an early advocate of arming blacks to provide more manpower. *Robert Toombs, former congressman from Georgia and an ardent secessionist. Politically ambitious, he was made Secretary of State of the Confederacy but resigned for a field command, while simultaneously holding a seat in the Confederate congress. He led a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia. His most famous action was the defense of Burnside's Bridge at Antietam, where he was wounded. After that battle, he resigned and served in the Confederate senate. *Howell Cobb, another former congressman from Georgia and ardent secessionist from Georgia. He served as the President of the Confederate States Provisional Congress both joining the Army of Northern Virginia as a brigade commander. He would see service in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battle, and play a key role in stemming the Union tide at the Battle of South Mountain. Transferred out in October 1862 to command the District of Georgia and Florida. He and his troops would play roles in Atlanta Campaign, where they constituted the Georgia Reserve Corps, and Wilson's Raid, where he and his troops put up a last ditch attempt to halt it at the Battle of Columbus. Spanish–American War *Matthew Butler, a former Confederate major general and postwar senator from South Carolina, was appointed major general of volunteers at the beginning of the military expedition to Cuba. After the American victory, he supervised the evacuation of Spanish troops. *Fitzhugh Lee (nephew of Robert E. Lee), a former Confederate major general and postwar governor of Virginia. He commanded an army corps in the war and served as the military governor of Havana with the rank of major general of volunteers. *Joseph Wheeler, a former Confederate major general and postwar congressman from Alabama, who is considered to have been one of the finest cavalry officers of the Civil War. The U.S. government was wary about placing staging points for the Cuba expedition in Southern states, which were still deeply mistrustful of the federal government after suffering the trauma of losing the Civil War and then going through the Reconstruction that followed. It was decided to allow Wheeler to rejoin the US Army—from which he had resigned as a second lieutenant in 1861—at the rank of major general of volunteers. This proved to be an effective public-relations measure, helping to unite the still deeply scarred region with the rest of the country against a common enemy. Wheeler was given command of the cavalry division for the invasion of Cuba, during which he was also nominally second in command of V Corps. An oft-told anecdote has the elderly Wheeler, in the excitement of leading men into battle again, allegedly shouting to his men, \\"Let's go, boys! We've got the damn Yankees on the run again!\\"Post War Lives: Joseph Wheeler (1836–1906), The Civil War Trust Despite that apparent hiccup of memory, Wheeler proved to still be a highly capable commander throughout the successful campaign, and was a senior member of the peace commission at its end.

Etymology The German name Vinschgau, like Italian Val Venosta, is derived from the Celtic (Rhaetian) Venostes tribes mentioned on the ancient Tropaeum Alpium. A Frankish Gau was established under Charlemagne in 772; it was first mentioned in a 1077 deed, when King Henry IV of Germany granted the estates of Schlanders in pago Finsgowe to Bishop Altwin of Brixen. Geography Upper Vinschgau near Mals The Vinschgau ValleyAllgemeiner historischer Handatlas, Gustav Droysen runs in a west-east orientation, from the Merano basin at Partschins up the Adige river to Reschen Pass in the northwest. The Ötztal Alps in the north, part of the Alpine crest, separate it from the upper Inn Valley. The Adige valley is further confined by the Sesvenna Alps in the west and the Ortler Alps in the south. It comprises several side valleys, such as the Suldental, the Matscher Tal, or the Schnalstal. Due to the insular location within the Central Eastern Alps, a rather warm climate and a lack of rain (400mm per year), fields, meadows and apple orchards are irrigated. Viticulture is also common. According to the 2001 census, 96.51% of the population of the valley speak German, 3.41% Italian and 0.08% Ladin as first language.Bevölkerung und soziales Leben, Statistisches Jahrbuch 2006, p. 120, tab. 3.19 Subdivision The Vinschgau District (; ) was established in 1962.

It was designed by Polyphony Digital, the developers of the popular Gran Turismo auto racing series. Tourist Trophy is one of only four titles for the PlayStation 2 that is capable of 1080i output, another being Gran Turismo 4, the game engine of which is heavily used in Tourist Trophy. Tourist Trophy was first released in China on January 26, 2006, then in Japan on February 2, 2006. The NTSC edition was officially released on April 4, 2006 with seven extra motorcycles, new riding gear, seven bonus background music tracks, enhanced visual effects, an exclusive \\"Semi-Pro Mode\\" and bike profiles. The PAL edition was launched on June 1, 2006 in Australia, and in Europe the next day. The PAL version offers two additional motorcycles and five new BGM tracks from European artists Infadels, Vitalic and Hystereo. Gameplay = TT Mode =  License School  Tourist Trophy's core \\"Race Event\\" mode requires licenses, obtained after completing riding lessons on various circuits using various motorcycles. There are four licenses to unlock, and each following license is progressively more difficult to obtain and allows the player to unlock faster motorcycles in Challenge Mode upon completion. Challenge Mode Unlike the Gran Turismo games, Tourist Trophy does not contain a currency system. The player has to obtain licenses in order to complete short races in \\"Challenge Mode\\" and thus win motorcycles to add to their garage. Motorcycles won by the player are used and tuned to compete in championships, and are unlocked for use in Arcade Mode. Tourist Trophy has 135 motorcycles with engine displacements from 124 cc to 1670 cc, including both road and race versions from 1961 through 2007. Dedicated racing bikes exist as semi-licensed \\"RacingModified\\" versions of street bikes, as well as five official fully licensed 2005 Suzuka 8 Hours endurance bikes. Motorcycles from many major manufacturers, as well as two specialized Japanese tuners, Moriwaki and Yoshimura, are included; bikes from the latter two can only be obtained as prizes in Race Events. 37 different track layouts are present in the game, including 22 original courses, the Tsukuba Circuit motorcycle layout, and two versions of Fuji Speedway as it appeared in the 1980s and 1990s. The motorcycle selection covers a broad range of modern motorcycles, including scooters, enduros, motards, sports bikes and naked bikes, as well as any respective \\"RacingModified\\" versions. For \\"RacingModified\\" bikes, a racing number from 5 through 99 can be selected—numbers 1 through 4 must be won in Race Events.  Race Event  Race Events are championships that consist of multiple races. Winning all races within a championship will award the player with new motorcycles and riding gear, and finishing an entire championship will grant the player's motorcycle a special racing number depending on their overall position. Prize bikes include \\"RacingModified\\" variants unavailable in Challenge Mode, and a classic racing motorcycle, the 1961 Honda RC162. Beating all Race Events will unlock a bonus 23rd Race Event. Completing the game will unlock the \\"Ending Movie\\" and add the \\"Clover Crown\\" ending theme to the \\"Music Theater\\".  Riding Gear  A feature exclusive to Tourist Trophy is \\"Riding Gear\\" (named \\"Closet\\" in the Asian editions). The player can unlock and collect 186 different riding accessories for their rider, including different helmets, gloves, boots or shoes, pants, one-piece racing suits, and jackets commercially available from more than a dozen manufacturers (Simpson, Vanson Leathers, Alpinestars, Arai, Shoei, Kushitani, RS Taichi, Dainese, AGV, Lewis Leathers, Bell, SPIDI, and XPD). Up to four different combinations can be saved, including two racing suits and two casual outfits. The Suzuka 8 Hours racing motorcycles have their own respective racing suits, which can only be used with said bikes selected. The player cannot use any other riding gear with these motorcycles. =Riding Form= The \\"Riding Form\\" option is available in both Arcade Mode and TT Mode. Before an Arcade Mode race, the user can choose among four Riding Form presets: \\"Lean Body\\", \\"Neutral\\", \\"Lean Bike\\" and \\"Motard/Dirt\\". Lean Body focuses on quick cornering, Neutral focuses on handling, and Lean Bike prioritizes slow cornering. The Motard/Dirt form with one leg out in turns is dedicated to enduro and naked bike riding; however, the user is free to use it on all bikes. This mode is named after the mode in Gran Turismo games. In TT Mode, the user can enter the Garage Riding Form settings with up to four fully customizable forms to save. They are saved as \\"Form A\\", \\"Form B\\", \\"Form C\\" and \\"Motard/Dirt\\". Each one has eleven unique parameters and four presets: \\"Neutral\\", \\"Lean Body\\", \\"Lean Bike\\" and \\"Motard/Dirt\\" from which to choose. The adjustable parameters are as follows: * \\"Head Roll Angle\\" dictates how far to the side the rider's head turns in corners. * \\"Head Pitch Angle\\" dictates how far up or down the rider's head is positioned. * \\"Lateral Slide\\" determines how far the rider's hips slide towards the inside of a turn. Increasing this value raises cornering speed at the cost of stability and responsiveness (as a result of the change in center of mass). * \\"Vertical Slide\\" dictates how much the rider tucks their body towards the bike in corners. * \\"Body Lean (Full Bank)\\" dictates the extent to which the rider leans into corners. * \\"Torso Roll Angle\\" determines how far the rider's torso leans into corners. Decreasing this value results in increased responsiveness at the cost of stability. * \\"Torso Yaw Angle\\" determines how far the rider's torso twists toward corners. Decreasing this value results in increased responsiveness. * \\"Arm Angle\\" determines how far in or out the rider's elbows are positioned. Decreasing this value results in increased cornering speed (due to lower drag) at the cost of responsiveness. * \\"Seat Position (Forward/Back)\\" determines how far forward or back the rider sits, influencing their posture and the extent to which they tuck. * \\"Leg Angle\\" works much the same as the \\"Arm Angle\\" setting; a high value offers increased responsiveness while sacrificing cornering speed. * \\"Body Lean (Upright)\\" dictates the extent to which the rider tucks on straights. An increased value results in lower drag, and thus higher acceleration and top speed. = Gameplay settings = Tourist Trophy's default setting is \\"Normal\\". Using the Normal setting, the player can perform maneuvers such as wheelies and stoppies on powerful-enough bikes. These possibilities are disabled with the \\"Professional\\" setting. Enabling \\"Professional\\" will enhance the simulation aspect as well as the difficulty level, over the arcade-oriented Normal. The \\"Professional\\" setting is supposed to allow a more realistic experience with autonomous upper body control (as the \\"Tuck\\" manual function is enabled), and separate front and rear brake controls replace the double- brake default system. \\"Semi-Pro Mode\\" is an exclusive feature of the North American edition. Other options augmenting difficulty are \\"Strict Judgment\\"—a 10-second slowdown penalty for shortcuts as seen in Gran Turismo 4—and a \\"Best Line\\" display. =Other features= Photo mode and \\"Best Shot\\" Pre- generated photos can be taken from a race replay and saved on a PS2 memory card or a connected USB flash drive, like in Gran Turismo 4. This function is known in the game as \\"Best Shot\\". Using various replay angles as a digital camera, the game is able to produce a selection of screenshots with variable compression rate (Normal, Fine, or Super Fine) and size (up to 1280x960/72 dpi). Various parameters such as the camera angle or course section can be tuned. The user can choose to save the photo, print it with an Epson- compatible USB printer, or display it in-game using the \\"Musical Diaporama\\" feature. Saved game screenshots can be exchanged with friends or made public on the Internet. Unlike Best Shot, Photo Mode's parameters are fully adjustable and it gives the user the opportunity to compose their own photographs. Formatting the USB device in Photo Mode or Best Shot will create the \\"DCIM/100PDITT\\" folder, allowing Tourist Trophy to store, upload and download game picture files generated under the form \\"IMG_00X.JPG\\". Standard USB 2.0 flash drives (including MP3 players and mobile phones) can be used to manage game JPEG files instead of the official I-O Data model. Replay/ghost files A USB flash drive can host Tourist Trophy replay/ghost files downloaded from either the official game website or elsewhere online, and can be used to exchange files with another USB device. Once the files are in the flash drive, the user can upload them from within the game in order to compete with a ghost (\\"Time Attack\\") or to watch a replay (\\"Replay Theater\\"). Each file can be used as a Replay or as a Ghost. Formatting the USB device from Theater Mode will create the \\"PDI\\" folder, allowing Tourist Trophy to store, upload and download files generated under the name \\"replay.dat\\". Standard third-party USB devices are also compatible with such files. Development Polyphony Digital reused the physics engine, graphical user interface design, and all but one circuit from Gran Turismo 4. However, the number of NPC opponents has been reduced from five in the Gran Turismo series to only three. Tourist Trophy also uses the License School feature that was popularized by the Gran Turismo series, as well as the Photo Mode introduced in Gran Turismo 4. The B-spec mode, which appeared in Gran Turismo 4, is absent in Tourist Trophy. While wet, dirt and reverse racing conditions (as the game doesn't have any motorcycles eligible for snow and dirt conditions) and tracks such as Circuit de la Sarthe have been removed, a unique course was recreated specifically for Tourist Trophy. The Circuit de la Comunitat Valenciana Ricardo Tormo is an official track appearing in the Superbike World Championship and MotoGP, which sees extensive use as a test circuit during the off season. It reappeared in Gran Turismo (PSP) (due to its presence in Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and the World Touring Car Championship) but did not appear in Gran Turismo 5. Polyphony ostensibly planned to add this track to Gran Turismo 5 (as it remains unused within the game's files), but it was left out for unknown reasons. Original soundtrack The Tourist Trophy original game soundtrack was released on March 15, 2006 by For Life Music Entertainment. =Track listing= *Composed by: Sun Paulo and Makoto *Performed by: Sun Paulo, Quadra, Makoto, KASAI and Mitsuo Okada #\\"I against a speed\\" (Short Mix) – 3:14 #\\"Discommunication\\" (Short Mix) – 3:32 #\\"Who I am?\\" (Short Mix) – 3:46 #\\"Forest\\" (Short Mix) – 8:00 #\\"Fiber Optics\\" (Sun Paulo Remix) – 11:10 #\\"Five Silver Rings\\" – 2:36 #\\"Mystery\\" – 2:20 #\\"Low Sky\\" – 2:30 #\\"Mind Visions\\" – 2:31 #\\"Introduction\\" – 2:34 #\\"Far West\\" – 2:45 #\\"Blue on Black\\" – 2:52 #\\"Your Soul\\" – 2:23 #\\"Take Your Soul\\" – 2:04 #\\"Inside My Love\\" – 2:07 #\\"Peaces of Mind\\" – 2:32 #\\"OKINAWA WIND\\" – 3:00 #\\"BRAZILIAN WIND\\" – 3:02 #\\"CALIFORNIA WIND\\" – 3:32 #\\"Digital Mononoke Beat PT.1\\" – 3:09 #\\"Digital Mononoke Beat PT.2\\" – 2:49 Reception In October 2003, Sony Computer Entertainment's announcement of a Polyphony Digital motorcycle racing game generated excitement among Gran Turismo fans, and the debut of Tourist Trophy at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show was met with good reviews. The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. The game won IGN's award for Best PS2 Simulation of 2006. Possible sequel In 2015, when asked about the possibility of a sequel to Tourist Trophy, Kazunori Yamauchi said: \\"I am aware that the game is expected by many fans, so I can't deny a Tourist Trophy 2\\". While such a sequel has not yet come to fruition, Yamauchi later admitted in an interview in 2018 that it was \\"still [in] the back of his mind\\".

Life and career Lindsay was born in Eugene, Oregon, and was the second of eight children of George and Esther Ellis Lindsay. The family moved to Idaho when he was young, where he attended Wilder High School for a short time. By his own account, Lindsay is one-eighth Cherokee. =Career= Lindsay began performing at age 15 with local bands that played local venues. He was tapped to sing in a band called Freddy Chapman and the Idaho Playboys after he won a local talent contest. After Chapman left the area, Lindsay saw the other band members and a new member, Paul Revere Dick, playing at a local I.O.O.F. Hall. He persuaded the band to allow him to sing a few songs with them. The next day he was working at his regular job at McClure Bakery in Caldwell, Idaho, when Paul Revere came in to buy supplies for a hamburger restaurant that he owned. This chance meeting began their professional relationship. The Downbeats Lindsay became lead singer and saxophone player in a band with Revere and several others. He suggested they call themselves \\"The Downbeats\\" after a magazine with the same title. They made some demo tapes in 1960 in Boise, Idaho, and signed with a record company called Gardena Records. The group scored their first national hit with the piano/guitar instrumental \\"Like, Long Hair\\" which peaked at #38 in the Billboard charts on April 17, 1961. After changing personnel a few more times, the band recorded the song \\"Louie, Louie\\" about the same time that a rival Pacific Northwest band, The Kingsmen, recorded the song. The Kingsmen version was the one that charted nationally, but Mark and his bandmates also were gaining attention. Paul Revere & the Raiders Around the time \\"Louie, Louie\\" was recorded, they decided to use Paul Revere's name as a gimmick and bill themselves as \\"Paul Revere & the Raiders\\". They began to dress in Revolutionary War-style outfits. Mark Lindsay carried the theme a bit further by growing his hair out and pulling it back into a ponytail, which became his signature look. Lindsay and the group caught the attention of Dick Clark, who was developing Where the Action Is, an afternoon show for the teen market. Clark hired the group as regular performers, and the group soon became very successful. Lindsay's lanky stature and good looks, as well as his excellent singing voice, quickly gained him immense popularity; he became one of the premier American teen idols of the 1960s. Lindsay soon started working not only as the singer of the group, but also as a composer and producer. The Raiders were the first rock group signed by Columbia Records and were produced by Terry Melcher, the son of actress and singer Doris Day. Lindsay and Melcher became friends and shared a house for a while. The house later became infamous as the site of the horrific murders of actress Sharon Tate and others, committed by members of Charles Manson's \\"family.\\" Television Lindsay and Revere on Happening 68. By 1968 Lindsay had completely taken over the writing and producing tasks for the group. Paul Revere & the Raiders had a revolving cast of band members, with only Revere and Lindsay remaining in the group since its inception. Where the Action Is had passed into television history. Dick Clark had created another show, Happening '68, which was to be hosted by Revere and Lindsay, and was to feature the group. The group itself was featured prominently in this show, whereas in Where the Action is, the entire group was part of an ensemble of other musical performers. Happening '68 premiered in January 1968. The show was so popular that the group also hosted a daily version over the summer of 1968, called It's Happening. Happening '68 survived into 1969, at which point the name of the show became Happening. The show was canceled in October 1969. By this time, like many other groups, Mark Lindsay and his bandmates were trying to maintain their success, but also were exploring other opportunities. Lindsay began to record solo records and to produce records for his bandmate, Freddy Weller, who went on to have his own solo success in the country music genre. Lindsay had some success with such songs as \\"Arizona\\" (1969, Billboard #10), which sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc; and \\"Silver Bird\\" (Billboard #25) in 1970. Lindsay recorded \\"Indian Reservation\\", a song written by John Loudermilk and made into a Hot 100 top 20 hit by Don Fardon years earlier. It was intended to be a solo recording for Lindsay, but for marketing purposes, the decision was made to release the song under the simple band name of \\"Raiders\\" with just Lindsay & Revere appearing on the track along with L.A. session players from the Wrecking Crew, and the song was retitled with a subtitle, \\"Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)\\". It reached #1 on the charts, which Paul Revere & the Raiders had never done. Lindsay continued to chart solo singles throughout 1970-71: \\"Miss America\\" (#44 - May 1970), \\"And the Grass Won't Pay No Mind\\" (#44 - November 1970), \\"Problem Child\\" (#80 - January 1971), \\"Been Too Long on the Road\\" (#98 - June 1971) and \\"Are You Old Enough\\" (#87 - October 1971). Lindsay kept his profile up by appearing on The Carpenters television variety show Make Your Own Kind of Music, as well as singing the themes to films Something Big (1971) and \\"Jody\\", the theme from Santee (1973 - credited to The Raiders). By the mid-seventies the group no longer sold as many records as they once had, and both Lindsay and the Raiders lost their Columbia contract. Lindsay officially left the group in 1975 when he and Paul Revere apparently had different visions for the group and their own individual pursuits. He did make a few more appearances in 1976 for some Bicentennial performances as well as a Dick Clark produced reunion with his Action era bandmates in 1977. After the Raiders According to a Rolling Stone interview (conducted in 1985), Lindsay left The Raiders because \\"there was a contractual thing I didn't agree with, and I just stopped.\\" Lindsay continued to record solo singles for a few years (for Warner Bros., Elka and Greedy Records) before retiring from performing to serve as head of A&R; for United Artists Records. He contributed to the recordings of artists such as Gerry Rafferty (on \\"Baker Street\\"), Kenny Rogers, and others. His accomplishments also included composing jingles for commercials (including Baskin-Robbins, Datsun, Kodak, Pontiac and Levi's among others) and scores for motion pictures. He contributed both his voice and his musical compositions to advertisements for companies such as Yamaha, which used the music from \\"Silver Bird\\" as the background to one of its commercials. He also composed music for the movies For Pete's Sake and The Love Machine, sung by Barbra Streisand and Dionne Warwick, respectively, and for a 1982 documentary, The Killing of America, as well as a song for the movie Savage Streets. In 1980 he dubbed a voice and co-wrote the musical score (with W. Michael Lewis) for the American version of the Japanese movie Shogun Assassin. Lindsay made some appearances in 1985 in conjunction with the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, the Legends for Liberty tour (backed by the sixties jazz/rock band Spirit, and began to tour on his own again. In 1989 he quietly began recording at Kiva Studios (now House of Blues Studios of Memphis) in Memphis, Tennessee with friend Michael Bradley. Although the album Looking for Shelter was not picked up for national release, Lindsay made the album available for fans through his website in 2003. In the early nineties he met the group, The Chesterfield Kings in Rochester, New York, on one of his tours, and later collaborated with them, performing on their recording of \\"Where Do We Go From Here?\\" He also appeared in a cameo in their film, Where is the Chesterfield King? (2000). Lindsay's next official solo release was Video Dreams in 1996. This effort was warmly received and Lindsay began an even more aggressive touring schedule. Video Dreams had originally started as a duet album with Carla Olson. Lindsay previously dueted with Olson on \\"Ups and Downs\\", included on her 1994 album Reap The Whirlwind. Olson co-produced the original sessions with Lindsay and brought in Danny Federici and Eric Johnson, as well as songs written by two friends of hers, Scott Kempner of the Del Lords and Michael Nold. A disagreement about the album's direction led to the album becoming a solo album by Lindsay, though the song selection remained the same, with only one song added that had not originally been recorded with Olson.Various tapes exist of the early Lindsay-Olson duet edition mixes, which have not been released publicly. He followed this release with a holiday record (Twas the Night Before Christmas (2000)) and Live at Rick's Cafe (1999) (not a live album, but a collection of pre-rock standards). In 2003 he had announced he would retire from touring, but he later reconsidered. A recording of his first \\"farewell\\" show was released in 2004 (The Last Midnight Ride). He currently does some touring, but as of January 7, 2006, he was heard on a webcast every Saturday night on the website of KISN radio from 7 p.m. to 12 a.m. PST, titled \\"Mark After Dark.\\" On November 11, 2006, \\"Mark After Dark\\" switched to FM webcast \\"K-Hits 106-7\\" KLTH Saturday nights 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. PST. On March 10, 2007, the program \\"Mark After Dark\\" changed its name to \\"Mark Lindsay's Rock & Roll Cafe\\" to refer to Lindsay's restaurant, which opened to the public in Portland, Oregon, on August 27, 2007. The restaurant included a remote studio where Lindsay did his radio show in front of restaurant guests and can be seen from the street and sidewalk. The studio was also used at times by other K-Hits air personalities. On September 21, 2007, a federal lawsuit was filed against the new restaurant for the restaurant's allegedly unauthorized use of various trademarks owned by the Yaw family, who had operated Yaw's Top Notch Restaurants in the Portland area for many years. On May 12, 2008, \\"Mark Lindsay's Rock & Roll Cafe\\" announced its closure. Lindsay's recording of Treat Her Right with Los Straitjackets in 2001 was cited by Stephen King in his column for Entertainment Weekly in May 2008. \\"This remake of Roy Head's 1965 soul hit smokes. And Mark Lindsay sounds so good you just gotta wonder where he was all those years.\\" During of summers of 2010-2013, Lindsay had a heavy touring schedule throughout the U.S. as part of the Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour, along with Flo & Eddie of The Turtles, The Grass Roots, The Buckinghams, and 'Monkees' member Micky Dolenz (2010 and 2013 only). In 2013, Lindsay recorded an album of new material on the Bongo Boy Records label entitled, \\"Life Out Loud.\\" Lindsay was on the national tour of the \\"Happy Together\\" tours of 2015, 2016, and 2018, and will be on the upcoming \\"Happy Together\\" tour of 2020. =Personal life= Lindsay married his second wife, Deborah (née Brown) on July 29, 1989, in McCall, Idaho, after his first marriage to Jaime Zygon ended in the early 1980s, and now lives in Maine.

The Know-Nothing Riots of 1856 occurred in Baltimore between September and November of that year. The Know- Nothing Party gained traction in Baltimore as native-born residents resented the growing immigrant population. Local street gangs became divided on political grounds, with the Know-Nothing affiliated gangs clashing with Democrat affiliated gangs. The partisans were involved in widespread violence at the polls and across Baltimore during municipal and national elections that year. The Know Nothing Party platform  The Know-Nothing Party originated in New York in 1844, when the American Republican Party officially split from the American Whig Party. The Know-Nothing Party's central policies were nativist, or hostile to immigrants. Nativists feared that the immigrants would use their voting power to elect unsuitable politicians, given the generalization that immigrants were aligned with radical political groups and typically worked in low paying jobs. Know-Nothing policies were strongly anti- Catholic, as Know-Nothings feared that Catholics were more loyal to the Catholic Church than the government. Irish Catholics were the main targets of nativist discrimination in the nineteenth century.  Origins of the Know- Nothing Party in Baltimore, Maryland  The Know-Nothing Party gained traction in Baltimore as the population of immigrants grew during the 1850s, and immigrants competed with native-born Americans for jobs. In 1850, twenty percent of Baltimore's population were immigrants, and by 1854 immigrants made up about 1/4 of the total population. Sixty percent of the state population were Methodists who often associated Catholicism with stereotypes of immoral behavior among immigrants, argues Historian Jean H. Baker. The Party's first meeting in Baltimore took place August 18, 1853 with about 5,000 in attendance. The party's central policies called for secularization of public schools, complete separation of church and state, freedom of speech, and regulating immigration. The first Know-Nothing candidate elected into office in Baltimore was Mayor Samuel Hinks in 1855. = Geography of politics in Maryland = In the 1850s, ethnic groups often separated themselves into \\"territories\\" that neither native born or immigrants dared to cross. The Lexington Market area was predominantly Democratic while Know-Nothings generally lived in the Federal Hill area in Baltimore By 1857 Know-Nothings dominated cities in eastern and western Maryland. The cities of St. Michaels and St. Fredericks, with larger immigrant populations, were heavily Know- Nothing, showing hostility between native-born and immigrants that lived in the same place. Predominantly Democrat areas were higher in Catholic and immigrant populations, such as Leonardtown.  Violence in Baltimore  = The formation of Baltimore street gangs = Baltimore street gangs formed in the early 19th century but became more formally organized around the 1830s. The New Market Fire Company became notorious in Baltimore, often feuding with the gang called the Rip Raps. Street gangs in Baltimore developed connections with politicians from opposing political parties in the 1830s. The founding members of the Plug Uglies street gang were strongly nativist. = General violence = Baltimore was given the nickname \\"Mob-Town\\" because of a longer history of rioting and a poorly staffed police force that did little to stop the violence. Historian Jean H. Baker argues that violence regularly broke out in Baltimore on days when men did not have to work, and riots were very likely to break out during weekend activities such sporting events and festivals. Historian David Grimsted argues that there was at least one large riot yearly between local fire companies in Baltimore 1856-1861, and the tolerance for this violence by political figures was \\"but a step to the election riots that disgraced Baltimore.\\" = Election violence = Violence on election days was especially common in nineteenth century Baltimore, as polling places were located in predominantly native-born districts, so immigrants travelling to these polling places were often targeted by nativist rivals. Historian Jean H. Baker argues that both Democrats and Know-Nothings in Baltimore used \\"press, pamphlet, and political speech,\\" to promote violence in the name of political gains. 1856 Election riots =September 12th riot= September 12, 1856, on the celebration of Baltimore's founding, local Know-Nothing associated gangs the Blood Tubs, the Wampanoags, and the Rip Raps raided a tavern and fired shots. 2 people died and around 20 were injured. The riot solidified Baltimore's reputation of lawlessness in nationwide newspaper coverage. =Municipal election riot on October 8th= The days leading up to the municipal election on October 8, were already marked by violence between the Democrats and Know-Nothings. A riot ensued on October 5, 1856, when Democrats tore down a Know-Nothing flag. The Democrats, trying to ward off the Know- Nothings, took cover in a nearby home and had a cannon. Police interfered, arresting several Democrats. The next day, October 6, 1856, a shootout ensued after Know-Nothings provoked Democrats on Baltimore Street. Know-Nothings also sacked a tavern owned by Democrat Sam McElwee in the Centre Market area. Know- Nothings were about to raid the Democrat \\"Empire House\\" but were apprehended by police. Know-Nothings fled from the police towards Jones' Falls, ending in a fifteen minute shootout on Holliday Street between the rival parties. Election day October 8, 1856 was marked with violence in twenty city wards in Baltimore. Democrats incited a riot in the eighth ward, nicknamed \\"The Irish Eighth,\\" when Democrats tried to drive Know-Nothings out of the eighth ward's polls, and a shootout occurred on Monument Street. 3 Democrats were killed. The same day another riot took place when Know-Nothing affiliated Rip Raps plundered the Democratic New Market Fire Company firehouse in the Lexington Market Area. 2 Know-Nothings died in the crossfire. Historian Tracy Matthew Melton argues that the widespread riots of the day signified the deadliest outburst of violence in Baltimore history at that point. The partisans involved were overwhelmingly well-known fighting men with deep connections to the street violence of the fire companies. During the fighting at Lexington Market, Rip Raps specifically targeted the tavern owned by Petty Naff, the New Market's most notorious rowdy. Petty Naff was a target for Know-Nothing rivals as he led the New Market Fire Company. Naff was notorious in Baltimore for his history of conflict with the police, involvement in riots, assault charges, and his alleged connection to the murder of two men. = National and state election riot November 4th = National and state elections took place on November 4, 1856. Mayor Swann ordered the Maryland Light Division of Infantry to be on standby, but it was never put to action during the violence of that day, and Swann refused Governor Ligon's offering of military reinforcement. Tensions over whether or not the results of the election would be fairly polled resulted in election violence. In Baltimore's 6th ward, a mob fired a cannon at police. In the 2nd ward, Know-Nothings were thrown out of polling stations by Democrats, but Democrats were eventually curbed by Know-Nothings from the 4th ward who provided back-up. 67 people were injured and 17 died in the events of the riot. Know-Nothing Candidate for President Millard Fillmore was victorious in Baltimore, receiving 16,900 votes. Maryland was the only state in which Fillmore won votes in the electoral college. Response and continued violence =Government response= In the aftermath of the 1856 election riots, charges were pressed against only two men involved. Charges were dropped against one man and the other man was acquitted. Historian Tracy Matthew Melton argues that local street gangs' affiliation with the Know- Nothing or the Democratic parties allowed them to commit acts of violence without consequences. On December 1st, 1856, a bill was presented to the City Council that would strengthen the police force. The new force, led a Marshal, would consist of 397 men of the Mayor's choosing. All officers were to be given a fixed pay, a baton, a gun, and an official uniform. Baltimore would be separated into districts where police would surveil the streets at all times. The bill was approved by Mayor Swann on January 1, 1857 and went into effect March 1, 1857. In the city elections of 1857, officials hoped to better prepare to control instances of election violence. Governor Thomas Ligon ordered George H. Steuart's militia of over 3,000 men because he felt that local authorities did not adequately respond to violence. Ligon was met with criticism by Mayor Swann, who argued that it was unconstitutional for the governor to order a militia without seeking permission first. Local officials ruled that Ligon did not have legal grounds to call a militia and did not provide enough evidence to support the need for one. Mayor Swann instead ordered 200 special policeman to support the existing force on election day. Additionally, Mayor Swann reinforced the existing police force, adding 105 men. The strengthened police force proved to be ineffective, as policemen did little to interfere during outbreaks of violence during election. To prevent violence at the polls, the city wards were redrawn and the number of polling stations increased, but the two parties would freely relocate the polls themselves. The Democratic Party in Baltimore asked voters to submit evidence of voter suppression by Know-Nothings. =Continued violence= Election violence and fraud in Baltimore continued in the following years despite efforts to stop it. In the 1857 gubernatorial election, riots were not as common but voter suppression was employed by Know-Nothings. Know-Nothings would beat anyone who was not voting on a Know-Nothing Ballot, marked by a red stripe. Know-Nothing candidate Thomas Holliday Hicks was elected governor, and assured that he would \\"Never call on a militia the night before an election,\\" like Governor Ligon did.

Since raptors are highly specialized predatory birds, special skills, facilities, equipment, veterinary practices and husbandry methods are necessary. Raptor rehabilitators often use falconry techniques or gain assistance from falconers to exercise the birds prior to their release, as their muscles often atrophy during their convalescence. In the United States, a license is required to possess any bird which falls under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA), and so the rehabilitators are under loose scrutiny from their state wildlife management authority as well as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Raptors that cannot be released back into the wild are sometimes used for education or transferred to licensed falconers. Some states require that birds that cannot be placed or released be euthanized. Most states do not allow rehabilitators to keep raptors under their rehabilitation permit for more than a few months. No funds for raptor rehabilitation are provided by the U.S. government, though it claims ownership of all raptors protected by the MBTA.

It also operates a large chain of adult retail stores, adult websites, adult production studios, gay bars, nightclubs, sports bars, karaoke bars, restaurants, and has substantial real estate holdings. As the largest strip club operator in the world, it is also one of the largest adult businesses in history. Its flagship locations in Las Vegas and Tijuana are the largest adult nightclubs in the World. The company is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was founded by Harry Mohney, who opened his first Deja Vu Showgirls club in Lake City, WA, in 1985 with partners Larry Flynt and Roger Forbes. Deja Vu had a humble beginning when Mohney secured employment in the early 1960s as a projectionist at a drive-in movie theater in Durand, Michigan, later converting the failing enterprise into the infamous \\"Durand Dirties\\" drive-in porn theater. The company quickly grew to over 300 adult theaters and stores nationally. Mohney pioneered the concept of the modern strip club in 1971, opening various \\"go-go\\" bars in the Midwest. An elusive man often referred to as the \\"Howard Hughes of Porn,\\" Mohney was the largest distributor of pornography from the late '60s to the mid '90s, grossing nearly $1 billion in the distribution business between 1970 and 1998. That business largely concluded with Mohney serving three years in federal prison for tax-related crimes. While he was indicted over 100 times, this was the only charge that ever resulted in a conviction. While Deja Vu's clubs operate under nearly 30 brand names, many are called Deja Vu Showgirls, Little Darlings, Dream Girls, Larry Flynt's HUSTLER Club, or HUSTLER's Barely Legal Club. Mohney's long-time friend, Larry Flynt, licenses Deja Vu the brand names for the HUSTLER Clubs and HUSTLER Hollywood stores, but is not involved in their operations. Deja Vu has monopolies or near-monopolies in many areas, including San Francisco, Washington State, and Tijuana, Mexico. The clubs typically aim for a clean and upscale atmosphere and offer fully nude or topless stage dancing as well as lap dances. Deja Vu clubs are widely known for hosting industry-wide contests, including Showgirl of the Year, Pole Princess, and Showgirl Spectacular. Its publicity stunts and charity events at various clubs often garner international media attention. Deja Vu's operation also includes a large chain of adult retail stores with nearly 60 locations. Those businesses also operate under a variety of trade names, including HUSTLER Hollywood, The Love Boutique, Adult Emporium, and Pleasure Emporium. They sell adult merchandise such as sex toys, lingerie, DVDs, etc., with most also featuring adult theaters and arcades. Deja Vu's Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas is a non-profit educational museum that features the world's largest collection of historical erotica, sexual artifacts, antique sexual devices, and one-of-a-kind exhibits, with nearly 30,000 feet of exhibition and education space. Its grand patron is Harry Mohney, with many items borrowed from his expansive personal collection. While Deja Vu does not publicize all of its assets, various newspaper articles and legal filings have disclosed investment in an array of companies, including various adult video production studios and websites, popular gay bars like The Gay 90's, renowned nightclubs like The World-Famous Cat's Meow, and even national restaurant chains like Dick's Last Resort. Las Vegas, Nevada The company is also known for having operated various businesses that set various landmark First Amendment Supreme Court decisions, including Miller v. California, Marks v.

Wolpe named the font after Albertus Magnus, the thirteenth-century German philosopher and theologian. Wolpe studied as a metal engraver, and Albertus was modelled to resemble letters carved into bronze. The face began as titling capitals. Eventually a lowercase roman was added, and later a strongly cursive, narrow italic. Albertus has slight glyphic serifs. It is available in light and italic varieties. The project began in 1932. Titling caps were released first, and the Monotype Recorder of summer 1935 presented the capitals as an advance showing. Other characters and a lower case were added by 1940. Albertus has remained popular since its release and since the end of mass use of metal type phototypesetting and digital versions have been released.  Characteristics  * In the uppercase \\"M\\" the middle strokes descend only partway, not reaching the baseline, in the default version. * The uppercase \\"U\\" has a stem on the right side. * Figures are lining. In the metal type period, Albertus was offered with alternate characters, including a non- descending 'J' that stops at the baseline, an 'M' that reaches the baseline, and a different ampersand, similar to that used on Dwiggins' Metro. Wolpe later designed Pegasus, a spiky serif design intended to complement Albertus with more body text-oriented proportions. It was less popular and had faded in popularity by the end of the metal type period, although Matthew Carter digitised it and added a bold and italic in 1980 as part of a commemorative exhibition project on Wolpe's work.  Use  A metal-type specimen for Albertus, showing three alternative characters: a variant \\"M\\", \\"W\\" and ampersand. Albertus is used for the street name signs in the City of London, City of London Corporation and London Borough of Lambeth (where Wolpe resided until his death in 1989). Wolpe frequently used it in book jackets he designed for the London publisher Faber and Faber. It has also been used in many other publications. Outside of publications an adapted version of Albertus is particularly known for its use in surreal British Television series The Prisoner (1967–68), where it was used for all signage in the show's surreal prison village setting, as well as for the series' logo. The key adaptations were the removal of the dots from 'i's and 'j's and an uncial-style 'e'. It is also used for the title card on the American television series How to Get Away with Murder and was the typeface for Electronic Arts from 1999-2006. It is also known for its use by director John Carpenter in the opening credits of several of his films, including Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, Prince of Darkness, and They Live. British band Coldplay used the Albertus Medium variant on the album covers and subsequent single releases associated with their first three albums, Parachutes, A Rush of Blood to the Head, and X&Y.; It is the font used in the web cartoon series Battle for Dream Island (BFB). Major League Soccer franchise Charlotte FC uses the font in their brand, including their crest and logotype.  Digitisations  Monotype released an updated digital version of Albertus, named Albertus Nova, in 2017. It was digitised by Toshi Omagari as part of a Berthold Wolpe Collection series that included Pegasus and three other Wolpe typefaces. Monotype promoted the digitisation with an exhibition at the Type Museum in London. Omagari added a number of alternates, including metal type alternates, an 'A' based on Wolpe's lettering and an uncial 'e' used in the production design of The Prisoner. Monotype's previous digital version is also available and Albertus digitisations have also been sold by Adobe, Bitstream, Fontsite, SoftMaker and others. Bitstream's version is called Flareserif 821. URW++ released a lookalike version known as A028 for free for use with Ghostscript and TeX. Featuring medium and extra-bold weights but no italics, A028 is widely available on Linux systems and other open source environments.

Lomaland was a Theosophical community located in Point Loma in San Diego, California from 1900 to 1942. Theosophical Society leader Katherine Tingley founded it in 1900 as a school, cultural center, and residential facility for her followers. The American headquarters of the Theosophical Society Pasadena was also situated there. The facility was important to the growing city of San Diego for its cultural offerings, and it left a lasting legacy in its campus (now Point Loma Nazarene University) which still retains many of the unique architectural features of the original Lomaland. The residents of Lomaland also transformed their Point Loma neighborhood by planting so many trees, orchards and shrubs that the formerly barren neighborhood is now known as the \\"Wooded Area\\". Led by Katherine Tingley, the group came to Point Loma to establish a community that would model the philosophical and humanitarian goals of Theosophy. The \\"White City\\" envisioned by Tingley was to be located on the extreme western edge of the North American continent but oriented toward India, the spiritual center of Theosophical beliefs. The blend of new world confidence, Victorian morality, a love of antiquity, and Indian spirituality created a unique community that found its expression in architecture that is still visible on the campus of Point Loma Nazarene University. History of the Point Loma site Laying of the cornerstone, February 23, 1897 Gottfried de Purucker visited Point Loma in 1894, and in 1896 he met Katherine Tingley in Geneva where he spoke about the place. In 1897 Tingley bought a piece of land at Point Loma, and in February 1897 she laid the first stone for a School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity (SRLMA). In 1899 Tingley moved to Lomaland, and in 1900 Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society (UBTS) also established their headquarters there. Agricultural experimentation was essential to the Lomaland community's desire to be self-sufficient in all respects, and the group imported and tried many different types of plants and trees including avocados, oranges, and other fruit. Katherine Tingley's goal was to serve fresh fruits and vegetables at Lomaland every day of the year. In summer 1900, the educational arm of Lomaland, a Raja yoga school, was opened up. In 1901 followed an open air Greek theatre, a temple, in 1914 a college, and by 1919 a theosophical university. Many other buildings were established including a hotel, a theatre, a textile factory, a joinery, a bakery, a publishing house, and more. Vegetable and fruit gardens were planted. Around 60 percent of the community was female, and notable for this time, the same percentage was also represented in executive positions. Children at Raja Yoga Academy, Point Loma, 1911 \\"Raja Yoga\\" meant divine union, and the educational goals of the school involved not only the intellect, but also moral and spiritual development. The Raja Yoga Academy was a boarding school; over 300 students lived together in group homes that were known as \\"Lotus Houses.\\" Children from poor families could go to school without paying any charges. The students also played classical dramas, as well as those of Shakespeare. Each student had to learn to play at least one instrument, so that after 1905 the first school orchestra of the United States could hold weekly concerts and go on tour. A theosophical university was established in 1919. It offered courses in the humanities and in science, and was accredited by the state of California. In 1942 the university was relocated to Covina. The publishing house changed its name several times, it was called The Theosophical publishing company, Aryan theosophical press, or Theosophical university press. In 1942 Lomaland was sold, and the Theosophical Society moved to Covina, near Los Angeles. =Historic Buildings= The Raja Yoga Academy and the Temple of Peace, c. 1915 At its height, the community consisted of at least five or six dozen buildings, some quite distinctive. By 1900, the campus was dominated by the imposing Academy Building and the adjoining Temple of Peace. Both buildings were constructed in the Theosophical vernacular that included a flattened arch motif and whimsical references to antiquity. The buildings were topped by amethyst domes, which were lighted at night and could be seen offshore. The entrance to the Temple of Peace was dominated by two massive carved doors that symbolized the Theosophical Principles of spiritual enlightenment and human potential. These doors are currently located in the archives of the San Diego Historical Society.Greenwalt. page 127 The sculptor, Reginald Machell, was educated in England, but moved to Lomaland with the community in 1899. The interior furnishings he carved for the Academy Building were influenced by the Symbolist style popular in Europe at that time. Machell also supervised the woodworking school at Point Loma. Agricultural experimentation was essential to the Lomaland community's desire to be self-sufficient in all respects. Lomaland had public buildings for the entire community and several private homes. The home of Albert Spalding, the sporting goods tycoon, was built in 1901. The building combines late-Victorian wooden architecture with historical motifs such as the modified Corinthian column (now shaped like a papyrus leaf) and flattened arches. The amethyst dome was restored by a team of scholars led by Dr. Dwayne Little of the department of history and political science at San Diego State University in 1983. The first Greek amphitheater in North America was built on this site in 1901. It was used for sporting events and theatrical performances. Tessellated pavement and stoa were added in 1909. The theatre was the site of a number of productions of Greek and Shakespearean dramas. Cabrillo Hall, which served as the International Center Headquarters, and the Brotherhood Headquarters (also called \\"Wachere Crest\\" and \\"Laurel Crest\\"), was completed in 1909. It served as office for the Theosophical Society and as a residence for Katherine Tingley after 1909. It was originally located on the west side of Pepper Tree Lane but was moved in the early 2000's to the east side. Cabrillo Hall is currently the home of the Communication Studies department. The reception area was housed in a rectangular building known as the Executive Building. This multi-purpose structure was originally located just southwest of the Academy Building. It served a variety of functions that included telephone and mail services; in 1908 it was used as a display center for the Woman's Exchange and Mart. The unusual truss design in the interior of the building emphasized the square and the circle, which were symbolic of heaven and earth. =After the Theosophical Society= Lomaland dissolved in the aftermath of the Great Depression of the 1930s and the death of Katherine Tingley in 1929. In 1942, the campus was sold to Coronado developer George W. Wood. The Theosophical Society staff and remaining students moved to Covina. Wood planned to use the buildings and site to create a 5,000 population housing district (after using the property for temporary war housing during World War II.) However, due to limitations in the property transfer agreement and the dangerous condition of many of the buildings on the site, he was allowed to move in only 300 patrons. After Wood died, Dwight Standord helped purchase the property for the struggling Balboa University, a deal which was finalized on September 15, 1950. That same year, Balboa University became affiliated with the Southern California Methodist Conference, changed its name to California Western University and relocated to Lomaland. In 1960, the failing Cal Western law school moved from its downtown location to Rohr Hall at Point Loma to join the rest of the school. The law school received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1962. In 1968, California Western University changed its name to United States International University (USIU). The law school, however, retained the name Cal Western. In 1973, the law school relocated from its Point Loma location to the current downtown campus and Pasadena College moved to Point Loma to replace it. USIU moved to Scripps Ranch and in 2001 it merged with California School of Professional Psychology to form Alliant International University. Pasadena College was renamed Point Loma College, then Point Loma Nazarene University, and remains at that location.

An oral medicine doctor has received additional specialized training and experience in the diagnosis and management of oral mucosal abnormalities (growths, ulcers, infection, allergies, immune-mediated and autoimmune disorders) including Oral cancer, salivary gland disorders, temporomandibular disorders (e.g.: problems with the TMJ) and facial pain (due to musculoskeletal or neurologic conditions), taste and smell disorders; and recognition of the oral manifestations of systemic and infectious diseases. It lies at the interface between medicine and dentistry. An oral medicine doctor is trained to diagnose and manage patients with disorders of the orofacial region, essentially as a \\"physician of the mouth.\\" It represents an emerging specialty of Dentistry. On March 2 2020, Oral Medicine became the 11th ADA recognized dental specialty. The specialty is defined within Europe under Directive 2001/19/EC. History The importance of the mouth in medicine has been recognized since the earliest known medical writings. For example, Hippocrates, Galen and others considered the tongue to be a \\"barometer\\" of health, and emphasized the diagnostic and prognostic importance of the tongue. However, oral medicine as a specialization is a relatively new subject area. It used to be termed \\"stomatology\\" (-stomato- + -ology). In some institutions, it is termed \\"oral medicine and oral diagnosis\\". American physician and dentist, Thomas E Bond authored the first book on oral and maxillofacial pathology in 1848, entitled \\"A Practical Treatise on Dental Medicine\\". The term \\"oral medicine\\" was not used again until 1868. Jonathan Hutchinson is also considered the father of oral medicine by some. Oral medicine grew from a group of New York dentists (primarily periodontists), who were interested in the interactions between medicine and dentistry in the 1940s. Before becoming its own specialty in the United States, oral medicine was historically once a subset of the specialty of periodontics, with many periodontists achieving board certification in oral medicine as well as periodontics.  Scope  The orofacial pain region: \\"pain localized to the region above the neck, in front of the ears and below the orbitomeatal line, as well as pain within the oral cavity; [including] pain of dental origin and temporomandibular disorders\\". Oral medicine is concerned with clinical diagnosis and non-surgical management of non-dental pathologies affecting the orofacial region (the mouth and the lower face). Many systemic diseases have signs or symptoms that manifest in the orofacial region. Pathologically, the mouth may be afflicted by many cutaneous and gastrointestinal conditions. There is also the unique situation of hard tissues penetrating the epithelial continuity (hair and nails are intra- epithelial tissues). The biofilm that covers teeth therefore causes unique pathologic entities known as plaque-induced diseases. Example conditions that oral medicine is concerned with are lichen planus, Behçet's disease and pemphigus vulgaris. Moreover, it involves the diagnosis and follow-up of pre- malignant lesions of the oral cavity, such as leukoplakias or erythroplakias and of chronic and acute pain conditions such as paroxysmal neuralgias, continuous neuralgias, myofascial pain, atypical facial pain, autonomic cephalalgias, headaches and migraines. Another aspect of the field is managing the dental and oral condition of medically compromised patients such as cancer patients suffering from related oral mucositis, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws or oral pathology related to radiation therapy. Additionally, it is involved in the diagnosis and management of dry mouth conditions (such as Sjögren's syndrome) and non-dental chronic orofacial pain, such as burning mouth syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia and temporomandibular joint disorder.  Lumps and swellings of the mouth  = Types of lumps and swelling = It is not uncommon for an individual to experience a lump/swelling in the oral environment. The overall presentation is highly variable and the progression of these lesions can also differ, for example: development of a lesion into a bulla or a malignant neoplasm. Lumps and swellings can occur due to a variety of conditions, both benign and malignant such as: * Normal variation lesions **Pterygoid hamulus: This is a hook-shaped structure protruding postero-laterally from the inferior boundary of the medial plate of the pterygoid process **Parotid papillae: This is the exiting duct from the parotid gland which is commonly found adjacent to the upper second molar on the buccal mucosa **Lingual papillae: Seen covering the dorsum of the tongue * Inflammatory **Abscess: An abscess is a painful collection of pus, usually caused by a bacterial infection **Cellulitis: Commonly due to a bacterial infection spreading to the deeper layers of the skin leading to a multitude of complications **Cysts: A cyst is an epithelial lined sac of tissue that has either fluid or semi-fluid content inside **Sialadenitis: Infection of the salivary glands **Pyogenic granuloma: Is a relatively common, tumor-like, exuberant tissue response to localized irritation or trauma * Chornic granulomatous disorders **Orofacial granulomatosis: This is an uncommon condition but is seen to be increasing in prevalence. This condition presents with facial/labial swellings commonly accompanied with angular stomatitis or cracked lips, ulcers, mucosal tags, cobblestone mucosea or gingival swellings **Crohn's disease: This is a disease affecting the bowel but commonly has oral lesions associated. Examples of some oral presentations are: raised gingival lesions, hyperplastic folds/cobble-stone mucosa, ulcers, facial swelling and/or angular cheilitis **Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a multi-system condition which may lead to gingival enlargement or salivary gland swelling which may result in xerostomia * Developmental ** Unerupted teeth **Odontogenic cysts **Eruption cysts **Haemangioma **Lymphangioma **Palatal tori and mandibular tori: formation of new bone upon the surface of a present bone **Lingual thyroid: this is an abnormal mass of ectopic thyroid tissue seen at the base of tongue * Traumatic ** Denture-induced hyperplasia **Epulis **Fibroepithelial polyp **Haematoma **Mucocele **Surgical emphysema * Hormonal ** Pregenancy epulis ** Oral contraceptive pill gingivitis * Metabolic **Amyloidosis * Drugs **Phenytoin **Calcium channel blockers **Ciclosporin * Allergy **Angioedema * Infective **HPV * Fibro-osseous **Cherubism **Fibrous dysplasia **Paget's disease * Neoplasms **Carcinoma **Leukeamia **Lymphoma **Myeloma **Odontogenic tumours ** Minor salivary gland tumours So as seen above the list is extensive and by no means is this a complete and comprehensive representation of all the possible lumps/swellings that can occur in the mouth as to the means of acquiring a swelling in the mouth. When considering what a lump might be caused by the site of which it has appeared can be of significance. Below are some examples of swellings/lumps which usually are present as specific locations in the oral cavity: * Gingiva ** Congenital hyperplasia ** Abscesses ** Pyogenic granuloma ** Neoplastic ** Pregnancy epulis ** Drug-induced hyperplasia ** Angioedema ** Papilloma/warts * Palate ** Torus palatinus ** Abscesses ** Unerupted teeth **Pleomorphic adenomas/salivary neoplasms ** Invasive carcinoma from maxillary sinus **Kaposi’s sarcoma ** Developmental swellings associated with Paget’s disease * FOM ** Most commonly salivary calculi and denture-induced hyperplasia **Mucocele **Ranula ** Mandibular tori * Tongue and buccal mucosa ** Congenital haemangioma **Congenital macroglossia ** Mucocele ** Vesiculobullous lesions **Ulcers **Hyperplasia = Diagnosis of the cause of a lump or swelling = If there is any suspect or unknown reason as to why a lump has arisen In an individuals mouth it is important to establish when this first was noticed and the accompanied symptoms if any. On examination ensure that there is not an obvious cause to the swelling/lump via a thorough: medical, social, dental and family history, followed by an oral examination. Whilst examining the suspected lesion there are some diagnostic aids to note which can be used to formulate a provisional diagnosis. There are many factors taken into consideration in this diagnosis, such as: * The anatomical position & symmetry ** Midline associated lesions tend to be of a developmental origin (e.g. torus palatinus) ** Bilateral lesions tend to be benign (e.g. sialosis, diabetes etc) ** Consider associations with surrounding anatomical structures ** Malignant lesions are usually unilateral * Size and shape ** Diagrams or photographs are usually recorded alongside the actual measurement of the lesion * Colour ** Brown and black pigmentation may occur from a variety of aetiologies s such as: tattoo, naeuvus, melanoma ** Purple or red pigmentation may occur due to conditions such as: haemangioma, kaposi’s sarcoma or a giant cell lesion * Temperature ** If the lesion is warm it is thought an inflammatory cause is most likely (e.g. abscess or haemangioma) * Tenderness ** If a lesion is significantly tender on palpation the origin is usually thought to be inflammatory * Discharge ** Are there any secretions associated with the lesion upon palpation or spontaneously occurring * Movement ** The lesion should be tested to determine whether it is attached to adjacent structures or the overlying mucosa * Consistency ** Carcinoma is usually suggested by a hard/indurated consistency ** If a lesion is palpated and a crackling, ‘egg shell’ sound occurs this tends to be a swelling overlying a bony cyst * Surface texture ** Abnormal vascular changes suggests neoplasm ** Malignant lesions tend to be nodular and may ulcerate ** Papillomas are usually comparative to a wart-like appearance * Ulceration ** Squamous cell carcinoma is an example of a malignancy which can present with superficial ulceration * Margin ** Malignant lesions tend to have an ill defined margin ** Benign lesions tend to have a clearly defined margin * Number of lesions ** Multiple lesions might suggest an infective or developmental aetiology = Investigations = Once the surrounding tissues and the immediate management of any lumps/swellings are taken care of, an Image of the full extent of the lesion is needed. This is done to establish what the lump/swelling is associated with and to ensure that any damaging probablitiy is kept to a minimum. There are a variety of imaging technique options which are chosen based on the lesion: size, location, growth pattern etc. Some examples of images used are: DPT, Scintigraphy, Sialography, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Ultrasound. As described some lumps or swellings can be in close relation to anatomical structures. Commonly, Teeth are associated in a lesion which brings about the question – “are they still vital?” In order to clarify, any tooth that is associated with a lump or swelling is vitality tested, examined for any pathology or restorative deficiencies in order to determine the long term prognosis of this tooth and how this might affect treatment of the lump/swelling at hand. Alongside any radiographs wchih may be justified, Blood tests may be needed in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis if there is a suspicion of potential blood dyscrasias or any endocrinopathy involvement. Finally, a particularly vital means of diagnosis is a biopsy. These tend to be regularly done in the cases of singular, chronic lesions and are carried out in an urgent manner as lesions of this category have a significant malignant potential. The indications to carry out a biopsy include: * Lesions that have neoplastic or premalignant features or are enlarging * Persistent lesions that are of uncertain aetiology * Persistent lesions that are failing to respond to treatment Once a small piece of tissue is removed for the biopsy, it is then microscopically histopathologically examined.  Training and practice  =Australia= Australian programs are accredited by the Australian Dental Council (ADC). They are three years in length and culminate with either a master's degree (MDS) or a Doctor of Clinical Dentistry degree (DClinDent). Fellowship can then be obtained with the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, FRACDS (Oral Med) and or the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, FRCP. =Canada= Canadian programs are accredited by the Canadian Commission on Dental Accreditation (CDAC). They are a minimum of three years in length and usually culminate with a master's (MSc) degree. Currently, only the University of Toronto, the University of Alberta, and the University of British Columbia offer programs leading to the specialty. Most residents combine oral medicine programs with oral and maxillofacial pathology programs leading to a dual specialty. Graduates are then eligible to sit for the Fellowship exams with the Royal College of Dentists of Canada (FRCD(C)). =India= Indian programs are accredited by the Dental Council of India (DCI).Oral Medicine is in conjunction with oral radiology in India and it is taught in both graduate and post graduate levels as Oral Medicine and Radiology.They are three years in length and culminate with a master's degree (MDS) in Oral Medicine and Radiology. =New Zealand= New Zealand has traditionally followed the UK system of dual training (dentistry and medicine) as a requisite for specialty practice; the University of Otago Faculty of Dentistry currently offers a 5-year intercalated clinical doctorate/medical degree (DClinDent/MBChB) program. On 9 July 2013, the dental council of New Zealand proposed that the prescribed qualifications for oral medicine be changed to include the new DClinDent in addition to a medical degree, with no requirement for a standard dental degree. =UK= In the UK, oral medicine is one of the 13 specialties of dentistry recognized by the General Dental Council (GDC). The GDC defines oral medicine as: \\"[concerned with] oral health care of patients with chronic recurrent and medically related disorders of the mouth and with their diagnosis and non-surgical management.\\" Unlike many other countries, oral medicine physicians in the UK do not usually partake in the dental management of their patients. Some UK oral medicine specialists have dual qualification with both medical and dental degrees. However, in 2010 the GDC approved a new curriculum for oral medicine, and a medical degree is no longer a prerequisite for entry into specialist training. Specialist training is normally 5 years, although this may be reduced to a minimum of 3 years in recognition of previous training, such as a medical degree. In the UK, oral medicine is one of the smallest dental specialties. According to the GDC, as of December 2014 there were 69 clinicians registered as specialists in oral medicine. As of 2012, there were 16 oral medicine units across the UK, mostly based in dental teaching hospitals, and around 40 practising consultants. The British & Irish Society for Oral Medicine has suggested that there are not enough oral medicine specialists, and that there should be one consultant per million population. Competition for the few training posts is keen, although new posts are being created and the number of trainees increased. =USA= The American Dental Association (CODA) accredited programs are a minimum of two years in length. Oral medicine, is an American Dental Association recognized speciality, and many oral medicine specialists fulfil a very important role by teaching at dental schools and graduate programs to ensure dentists and other dental specialists receive excellent training in medical topics pertinent to the dental practice. The ADA has recently started a dental practice parameters for world-class quality services.

The steering ratio is the ratio of the number of degrees of turn of the steering wheel to the number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta tricycles and bicycles, the steering ratio is always 1:1, because the steering wheel is fixed to the front wheel. A steering ratio of x:y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of the steering wheel, 360 degrees, causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1. A higher steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned more to get the wheels turning, but it will be easier to turn the steering wheel. A lower steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering wheel easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder to turn. Variable- ratio steering Variable-ratio steering is a system that uses different ratios on the rack in a rack and pinion steering system. At the center of the rack, the space between the teeth are smaller and the space becomes larger as the pinion moves down the rack. In the middle of the rack there is a higher ratio and the ratio becomes lower as the steering wheel is turned towards lock. That makes the steering less sensitive when the steering wheel is close to its center position and makes it harder for the driver to over steer at high speeds. As the steering wheel is turned towards lock, the wheels begin to react more to steering input Steering quickener A steering quickener is used to modify the steering ratio of factory-installed steering system, which in turn modifies the response time and overall handling of vehicle. When a steering quickener is employed in an automobile, the driver of the automobile can turn the steering wheel a smaller degree compared to a factory-installed steering system without a steering quickener, to turn the vehicle through same distance. On the other hand, the steering effort needed will greatly increase. If the automobile is equipped with power steering, overloading the power steering pump can also be a concern.Sergei Grishin, \\"Subaru Steering Quickener Installation\\", Racing Rebel, Retrieved 2017-07-31 Alternate definition Another use of the term steering ratio is for the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and the actual turning radius based on real tire behavior. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip is greater than the rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering.

Founded in 1887, the town lies within the Kinta Valley, an area rich with tin reserves. It was a tin mining town which boomed during the height of the tin mining industry. Many tin towns were established in the late 19th century, flourished in the 1900s, only to stagnate and decline after World War I, with the exception of an exhilarating boom in the 1920s. Most have closed down following the collapse of the industry, especially in the late 20th century. Geography Kampar is situated in the Kinta Valley, which was well known for its high tin ore reserves. Its vast surroundings as well as abandoned mining-ponds are suitable for fishing, which has become a major attraction for anglers around the country, especially from Kuala Lumpur. Kampar town can be broadly divided between the 'old town' and 'new town' areas. The old town consists of two main streets, Jalan Gopeng and Jalan Idris, of charming pre-war shop houses. The fronts of these shop houses are still mostly resemble their original appearance. Commerce in the old town area mainly consists of coffee shops, goldsmiths and local retailers. The new town area mainly consists of new residential developments and some commerce servicing the burgeoning education industry in Kampar. On the 21st of May 2009, the Sultan of Perak declared Kampar as the state's 10th district. However, according to the residents, there is no new or old town. The 'new town' is just a residential estate with a few rows of shop-lots to cater for the growing number of university students. The term 'new town' originates from the Cantonese spoken dialect which refers to Taman Bandar Baru as new town. Whereas 'Taman' in Malaysia refers to a residential estate. History Based on Datuk Hashim Bin Sam Abdul Latiff's article, early settlements in Kampar relate to the historic event of the murder of the British Resident in Perak, JWW Birch, as Ngah Jabor who was one of the early settlers in Kampar was amongst those connected to murder, together with the others who include Maharaja Lela, Datuk Sagor, Si Putum and others. However, Ngah Jabor escaped sentence when Raja Idris (Dris), who later became Sultan of Perak in 1887 presided over the case involving those accused of Birch's murder in 1876. Raja Idris and Ngah Jabor have family ties and share milk mothers since as an infant, Raja Idris was taken care of by Ngah Jabor’s mother, which is common amongst royal families to send their children to other families, particularly amongst the aristocrats, to feed. There is a possibility that between the years 1876 to 1886, Ngah Jabor went into hiding to equip him with spiritual skills and reappeared in public with a new identity as Mohamad Jabor. It is possible that during his hiding, he had opened a new settlement in Kampar to elude the British.Based on historical book under title \\"Buku Orang Biasa Diraja, Hayat dan Zaman Imam Perang Jabor (1858-1921)\\" – wrote by Hashim Sam. These book is produced by Malaysia Historical Association and the copies have been translated to English version by National Library of Malaysia under the title of \\"The Royal Commener; The Life and Times of Imam Perang Jabor, (1858-1921)\\" Kampar had its share of war during the Japanese Occupation between 1941 and 1945. From December 30, 1941 to 2 January 1942 the Battle of Kampar occurred. An estimated 3000 British soldiers defended the Kampar area against over 6000 Japanese soldiers. The British Army inflicted serious casualties on the Japanese and only retreated when their flank and rear was threatened by Japanese seaborne landings on the coast south of their position. This battle was documented by the famous Kampar historian, Chye Kooi Loong. (See link below) Kampar Independence Clock Tower =Origin of name= One plausible theory is that Kampar is named after the Kampar River (north of the current township). The river itself got its name from ethnic Malay immigrants from the Kampar Regency in Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, who used the river to navigate upstream and the main source of ancestry of the local Malay populace. This predates the large-scale mining of tin in Kampar, so it is likely that the Cantonese words \\"kam pou\\" were derived from the word Kampar, rather than the other way around. Curiously, Kampar Regency in Sumatra was where the 1st Sultan of Perak (Sultan Mudzaffar Shah) was based before becoming Sultan of Perak in Perak (his highness was a son of the last Sultan of Malacca). The local Chinese community had the impression it came from the Cantonese word kam pou as it means \\"precious gold\\" (referring to the town's previously large tin reserves, because of the Chinese people also speak in Cantonese only, although there are two dialect groups of the local Chinese populace dominating this town, notably the main Cantonese majority alongside with the Hakkas, which constitute the two largest ethnicities of the local Chinese population). This is misleading as they were not aware of the history of the area and its historic relation to Kampar (Riau) as stated in the paragraph above. Story behind Aston Settlement Arthur Vincent Aston CMG, MC (born 1896, in Chester-1981), was a Colonial Administrator in British Malaya. He was the first British Adviser for Perak after the abolishment of the post British Resident of Perak. In 1935, he spearheaded a plan to alleviate the crowding in Kampar. The already cramped and unhygienic living environment in the town was at its saturation point. Three years later in 1938, Aston Settlement located on the fringes of Kampar, was ready to resettle the dwellers. It is now listed among the 460 plus New Villages nationwide. That’s how the village got its name. Demographics In year 2010, the estimated population of Kampar district was 98,878 people.Department of Statistics, Malaysia: Population Distribution and Basic Demographic Characteristics, 2010, pg 79, Table 3.7: Total population by ethnic group, sex, administrative district and state, Malaysia, 2010 The majority of the Kampar's population is of 55.8% Chinese descent, 32.4% Malays, 11.4% Indian and others 0.2%.Department of Statistics, Malaysia: Population Distribution by Local Authority Areas and Mukims 2010: Table 1 : Key summary statistics for Local Authority areas, Malaysia, 2010, pg 7 There is a large student population with the Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TAR UC) and University Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) in the new residential area (Taman Bandar Baru Kampar). Economy In the 19th and most of the 20th century, the economy of Kampar revolved around tin-mining. However, many tin-mining companies were forced out of business during the economic recession in the 1980s. Nevertheless, the town's economy recovered, slowly, by the end of the 1980s. Since the completion of the North–South Expressway, Kampar's status as a bustling town has declined rapidly. Travelers stopped frequenting the town as they chose the more convenient highway. The nearest exit from highway is in Gopeng and Tapah, which is convenient for travelers. The commercial and industrial sectors are the main driving forces of Kampar's economy. More recently, its economy has been further driven by the construction of the new Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) campus. Also, Kampar is known for its freshwater fishing spot as most of the surrounding area is covered by man-made lakes. Centuries old abandoned tin mines have turned into natural lakes. Tilapia, Pangasius, Kaloi, Tutu, Tongsan, Catfish, and many kinds of freshwater fish flourish abundantly in these lakes. Most of these lakes are also converted into fish farms, duck farms or other horticulture produce farms. Before Hypermarkets, the available supermarket in Kampar is the Minat Supermarket. It is located near the bus station. Daily consumables can also be obtained from the many Chinese retail shops located all over Kampar. Some are as good as small scale supermarkets with a modern shop design. Education Kampar is a centre of tertiary education for the campus of Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TAR UC) and the new campus of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). With an estimated combined capacity of more than 20,000 students, these two institutions are touted to be the two instruments that will restore the town to its former glory. Other private institution of higher learning would be Kolej Menara Jaya and Kolej Sri Ayu. Overview of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Kampar is also served by various primary and secondary schools.

Among the local bus companies that are operating in Kampar would be Perak Transit and Kinta Omnibus Company (Both serving routes north of Kampar all the way to Ipoh), Kamta Omnibus Company (serving routes south of Kampar to Tapah) and Hup Soon Omnibus Company (routes from Kampar to Teluk Intan). The local bus station building has remained unchanged ever since it was built. Long distance, intercity express buses serves Kampar and has routes to Butterworth, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. They are located in the express bus station in the town area. Express bus companies from Terminal Bersepadu Selatan (TBS), Kuala Lumpur with direct links from Kuala Lumpur to Kampar are Perak Transit, Edaran, Super Ria, Konsortium and Parit Express. Ticket prices are around RM16-RM16.60 one way. The bus ride takes from Kuala Lumpur to Kampar will take about two and half hours. Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) and Tunku Abdul Rahman (TAR) college buses are also available for pickup service of their students around the vicinity. Taxis, which consists mostly of old E-Class Mercedes, are available around the local town bus station. Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) has introduced a shuttle train between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur Sentral that serves the Kampar Railway Station. It would take two and half hours between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur Sentral. The Kampar Train Station is located at the south-eastern part of town, in the vicinity of a housing estate known as Taman Melayu Jaya.

Under this parliament seat, there are 3 state seats namely (N40) Malim Nawar, (N41) Keranji and (N42) Tualang Sekah. The parliament seat is a traditional fight between the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Barisan Nasional (represented by Malaysian Chinese Association, MCA). The current member of parliament is Ko Chung Sen from Democratic Action Party – Pakatan Rakyat. Food Kampar is famous for its food. For example, fish ball noodles, chicken biscuit, claypot rice, prawn mee, rice noodles (\\"Lai Fun\\" in Cantonese), char kuay teow, wan tan mee, lor mai fan (glutinous rice), and ham kok chai (salty vegetable dumpling). Two types of food that made their way out of Kampar town itself and is synonymous with Kampar are chicken biscuit and fishball noodle. The Kampar chicken biscuit is so famous that it spawned a whole series of other 'chicken biscuit' brands. Other local cuisine includes the chee cheong fun, where curry is often the preferred condiment. Chee Cheong Fun is a noodle made from rice flour which is steamed into sheets and chopped up into noodle like slivers. In Kampar it is frequently served with 2 types of tofu, along with assorted fish balls or pig skin in curry. Chee cheong fun is commonly eaten for breakfast or supper where a couple of stores are set up at the local market.

In 1839 the mission relocated to Fairway, where it built a brick building referred to by names varying from Shawnee Indian Methodist Manual Labor School. It was one of the first such missions established in the territory acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1968, the Shawnee Methodist Mission is operated today as a museum. The site is administered by the Kansas Historical Society as the Shawnee Indian Mission State Historic Site. The Shawnee Methodist Mission served briefly as the second capitol of the Kansas Territory, when the legislature was controlled by pro-slavery advocates,History of Wyandotte County Kansas and its people, ed. and comp. by Perl W.

(cf., \\"When the first territorial legislature met at Pawnee on July 2, 1855, at the order of Governor Reeder in a stone building erected for its use, it unseated the free state members, seated the pro-slavery men instead, and then passed a bill \\"to remove the capital temporarily to Shawnee Manual Labor School.\\" It did this because the Shawnee mission was well known as a center of pro-slavery sympathy.\\") holding that designation from July 16 to August 7, 1855.

The Shawnee  The \\"Fish\\" Shawnee tribe was removed from its traditional Ohio home to the unorganized territories set aside for Native Americans (in the future state of Kansas) under the terms of a treaty dated November 7, 1825.Shawnee treaty The mission was initially built on land near the American Shawnee Indian Tribe reserve in Turner by Reverend Thomas Johnson. He hoped to convert the recently relocated tribe to Christianity. During the 1830s, some of the Shawnees' most venerated men, including Tenskwatawa \\"the Shawnee Prophet\\", frequently visited at the mission. The Prophet was the younger brother of Tecumseh, who had led a war against the United States earlier in the century. Tenskwatawa led the Shawnee in Tecumseh's absence at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Following defeat in this battle, Tenskwatawa took his men to the British Canadian colonies. He was placed under virtual house arrest for years following the end of the War of 1812. Tenskwatawa was eventually allowed to return to the Shawnee to help them remove from Ohio to Kansas; he died in 1836 at his village (the present site of Kansas City, Kansas).  The new mission  The mission was located at its original site from 1830 to 1839. In 1839, the mission was moved and built at its present-day Johnson County location, where an Indian boarding school was opened there. From 1839 until its closure in 1862, the Shawnee Mission served as a manual training school for Native Americans, principally from the Shawnee and Delaware tribes. The Shawnee Mission also served as the second capital of the Kansas Territory. The capital was moved to the mission on July 16, 1855, after pro-slavery delegates to the Territorial Legislature voted to depart the first Territorial Capitol of Kansas at Pawnee. It served as territorial capital until August 8, when the seat of government became Lecompton. While the capital was located at Shawnee Mission, the legislature promulgated the controversial pro-slavery laws that sparked Bleeding Kansas violence. During the American Civil War, the site served as a camp for Union soldiers. The Shawnee Mission was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968.

It is northeast part of the Department of Essonne. It is located from the center of Paris. The café Au Reveil Matin at 22 Avenue Jean Jaurès was the departure point of the first Tour de France in 1903. Montgeron was also the starting point of the 21st (and last) stage of the 2017 Tour de France. Geography =Climate= Situated in the region of Île-de-France, Montgeron has an oceanic climate, with cool winters and mild summers, and has more precipitation than others in the central parts. The mean temperature is around 10.8 °C, with a maximum of 15.2 °C and a minimum of 6.4 °C. However, the actual temperatures recorded are 24.5 °C in July at the maximum and 0.7 °C in January at the minimum, but the records registered the maximum temperature of 38.2 °C on 1 July 1952 and the minimum temperature of -19.6°C on 17 January 1985. Due to the lower urban density between Paris and its suburbs, a difference of one to two degrees Celsius is felt strongly. The amount of sunshine is comparable to the average of the regions of the north of the Loire with 1,798 hours per year. Precipitation is also distributed over the year, with a total of 598.3 millimeters of rain and an approximate average of fifty millimeters per month. =Transport= The outer view of Montgeron – Crosne station Although Montgeron is away from the course of the Seine, major axes of communication cross at Montgeron, most of them inherited from before. It was crossed by the old National Road 6 (N6) but now the road takes a detour to the west of the city center; the route is now occupied by the Departemental Road 50 (D50). The road D50 intersects the east-west running Departemental Road 31 (D31), which the latter leads to the neighboring commune of Yerres. The new portion of N6 shares its northern part with the Departemental Road 448 (D448) which the latter follows the river Seine south to Corbeil-Essonnes. Recent development and heavy traffic have made access to the city center much more difficult, which accentuates commercial desertification.

Populations and Society =Demographics= The evolution of the population is known through the censuses of the population carried out in the commune since 1793. Starting from 2006, the legal populations of the communes are published annually by INSEE. The census is now based on an annual collection of information, successively concerning all municipal territories over a period of five years. For municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, censuses are taken each year following a sample survey of a sample of addresses representing 8% of their dwellings, unlike other municipalities which have an actual census every five years. In 2017, the town had 23,775 inhabitants, an increase of 2.12% compared to 2012 (Essonne: + 4.74%, France excluding Mayotte: + 2.36%). http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=23463 http://www.map-france.com/Montgeron-91230/population-Montgeron.html http://www.linternaute.com/ville/montgeron/ville-91421/demographie https://ugeo.urbistat.com/AdminStat/en/fr/demografia/popolazione/montgeron/20004856/4 Placed on the important road from Paris to Melun at the edge of the Sénart Forest, Montgeron was a town already counting more than eight hundred and fifty people at the time of the first census of people in 1793. A period of chaotic evolution ensued with a growth to nearly nine hundred inhabitants in 1800 and a decrease until 1851. The milestone of nine hundred residents was reached in 1831 and that of the thousand residents ten years later. From 1856, following the arrival of the railway, a period of constant progress began, only briefly interrupted by the losses due to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the milestone of two thousand inhabitants being crossed in 1896. At During the twentieth century, the two world conflicts did not prevent the local population explosion, driven by massive urbanization which allowed the town to have nearly four thousand five hundred inhabitants in 1921 and more than ten thousand in 1946. This the figure doubled in the following twelve years and reached the historic peak of twenty-three thousand seven hundred eighty-six in 1975. The urban rehabilitation operations and the decline in enthusiasm for this town made it lose two thousand people in fifteen years before it returned to demographic growth from 1999, again negative in view of the 2007 figures establishing the Montgeron population to twenty-two thousand nine hundred twenty-nine people. Immigration has little impact on this demographic development since only 7.6% of the municipal population was foreign in 1999http://sig.ville.gouv.fr/Tableaux/91421#. In that year, the largest communities were distributed between 3.2% of the total for Portuguese population, 0.9% for Algerians, 0.5% for Moroccans, 0.4% for Turks and Italians, 0.3% for Tunisians and 0.2% for Spaniards. http://www.recensement-1999.insee.fr/RP99/rp99/wr_page.affiche?p_id_transac=&p;_theme=ALL&p;_typeprod=ALL&p;_id_nivgeo=C&p;_id_loca=91421&p;_id_princ=NAT2A&p;_id_second=NAT2A2&p;_langue=FR&p;_specim=N&p;_pourcent=1 Inhabitants of Montgeron are known as Montgeronnais. =Facilities= There is a library called Médiathèque du Carré d'Art, a post office, and the Avenue de la République has restaurants and shops.

The change to the character of the Army has endured.  Background  The Second Boer War of 1899-1902 exposed weakness and inefficiency in the British Army and demonstrated how isolated Britain was from the rest of the world. The war had been won only by leaving Britain defenceless on land. In 1900, Imperial Germany began to build a battlefleet and industrial growth had already made it overtake Britain's economic lead in Europe. The Elgin Commission had already advocated some changes in administration. Under Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster at the War Office the Report of the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee was set up to look into reform of the Army. It was chaired by Lord Esher, who had been a member of the Elgin Commission, as had two other members; Admiral Sir John Fisher (former Second Sea Lord and Navy reformer), and Colonel Sir George Clarke. The Esher Report was published, successively, in February and March 1904. Conclusions The Committee took evidence in private and its Report was in three parts. It analysed the complex arrangements and inefficiencies of the Army administration and made three main recommendations: * an Army Council modelled on the Board of Admiralty. It was designed as a single collective body to analyse and decide upon issues connected to policy and so end the confusion of the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for War, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster General. The War Secretary was to have the same power as the First Lord of the Admiralty and all military topics submitted to the Crown would go through him. That would increase civil and parliamentary control over the Army. Also recommended was that the Council would be made up of seven members. These were to be the Secretary of State for War, the First Military Member (with responsibility for operations and military policy), the Second Military Member (with responsibility for recruitment and discipline), the Third Military Member (with responsibility for supply and transport), the Fourth Military Member (with responsibility for armaments and fortifications), a Civil Member (who would be the Parliamentary Under-Secretary with responsibility for civil business other than finance) and another Civil Member (the Financial Secretary). It was recommended that this Council should meet frequently and decide matters by majority vote. * a General Staff with its Chief having the responsibility for preparing the Army for war. The post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces was to be abolished. The duties of the General Staff were to be shared by a Director of Military Operations, a Director of Staff Duties and a Director of Military Training. * the War Office was to be radically reorganised on rational grounds. The British Army had previously grown since 1660 by not grand design but piecemeal additions and reforms. The administration inside the War Office was to be divided between the Chief of the General Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General and the Master-General of the Ordnance. The Adjutant-General was given overall responsibility for the welfare and maintenance of the soldiers. Under him would be a Director of Recruiting and Organisation, a Director of Personal Services, a Director-General of Medical Services and a Director of Auxiliary Services. The previous office of Judge-Advocate-General was to be replaced with a Judge-Advocate with more limited power. Apart from manufacture, all parts of the process of material supply would be put under the Quartermaster- General. His department subordinates would be a Director of Transport and Remounts, a Director of Movements and Quartering, a Director of Supplies and Clothing and an Equipment and Ordnance Stores. The Master-General of the Ordnance's subordinates would be a Director of Artillery, a Naval Adviser and a Director of Fortifications and Works. That rationalisation was recommended by the Report to be implemented throughout the Army. The Report also claimed that policy and administration had become too centralised in the War Office, to the detriment of initiative. Administrative districtsSee British Commands and Army groups were recommended to be responsible for organisation to leave commanders of field units free to train for war.  Publication  King Edward VII welcomed the Report and successfully urged the Arthur James Balfour's government to accept its recommendations. However, some in the Army were wary of its recommendations, one opponent being Lord Kitchener. Richard Haldane, who became War Secretary for Henry Campbell-Bannerman's government in 1905, implemented many of its recommendations between 1906 and 1909. Among his advisers was General Sir Gerard Ellison, who was also Secretary of the Esher Committee. The recommendations were to form the basis of Army reform for the next 60 years. Military historian Correlli Barnett wrote that the Esher Report's importance \\"and its consequences can hardly be exaggerated.... Without the Esher Report... it is inconceivable that the mammoth British military efforts of two world wars could have been possible, let alone so generally successful.\\"Correlli Barnett, Britain and Her Army, 1509 - 1970 (Cassell, 1970), p. 359.

The program consisted of a series of kits available by subscription and sent by mail monthly. The program continued until 1989. , there is no mention of the program or its archives on the website of the Society for Science & the Public, which succeeded the old Science Service organization. Each month, thousands of subscribers received a small blue box about the size of a videocassette containing some material such as nylon thread or dinosaur bones. The box contained a yellow booklet explaining the topic for that month, along with the pieces and supplies needed to cover the topic. Some kits would teach about a specific topic, such as coal, static electricity, mechanical linkages, nonwoven fabrics, electroplating, or optical illusions. Other kits would provide parts to build items such as a small spectrograph, telescope, or pinhole camera. In addition to the monthly subscription, some kits were available for individual purchase, such as a \\"soilless gardening\\" unit which provided seeds, plant food, and instructions in hydroponics. Some kits contained basic materials for simple experiments in psychology. The modest annual subscription price ($5 in the 1960s) covered the cost of printing and postage. The instructions were written by Science Service staff, and the kit materials were donated by various companies. The Things of Science Club was started by Watson Davis, editor-in- chief of Science Service, because editors served by the service often asked for samples of the things the syndicate wrote about. The initial focus of the program was newspaper editors, but it soon shifted to young people. By 1946 the Science Service estimated that half of its subscribers were school groups and science clubs, and the other half were individuals. Membership in the club was limited to a few thousand because some of the \\"things\\", such as dinosaur bones, were hard to come by.

The Ilemi Triangle is an area of disputed land in East Africa. Arbitrarily defined, it measures between 10,320 and 14,000 square kilometres (3,985 and 5,405 sq mi). Named after Anuak chief Ilemi Akwon, the territory is claimed by South Sudan and Kenya. The territory also borders Ethiopia and, despite use and \\"trespass\\" into the triangle by border tribes from within Ethiopia, the Ethiopian government has never made any official claim on the Ilemi, and in fact agreed that the land was all Sudanese in the 1902, 1907, and 1972 treaties.The National Geographic Society in recent works has included an Ethiopian claim, later removed due to lack of sources. The World Factbook confirms that Ethiopia does not claim the territory Kenya now has de facto control of the area. The dispute arose from the 1914 treaty in which a straight parallel line was used to divide territories that were both part of the British Empire. However the Turkana people—nomadic herders continued to move to and from the border and traditionally grazed in the area. The perceived economic marginality of the land as well as decades of Sudanese conflicts are two factors that have delayed the resolution of the dispute.  Peoples  The nomadic Turkana move in the territory between South Sudan and Kenya and have been vulnerable to attacks from surrounding peoples. The other peoples in this area are the Didinga and Topasa in South Sudan, and the Nyangatom (Inyangatom) who move between South Sudan and Ethiopia, and the Dassanech who live east of the triangle in Ethiopia. These pastoral people have historically engaged in raids on livestock. While in the past they used traditional weapons, since the nineteenth century onwards the use of firearms has been common.  History  A map of the Ilemi Triangle showing 1938 \\"red line\\", 1947 \\"blue line\\" and Sudan's 1950 patrol line (green). To the southeast of the Ilemi, Ethiopian emperor Menelik laid claim to Lake Turkana and proposed a boundary with the British to run from the southern end of the lake eastward to the Indian Ocean, which was shifted northward when the British and Ethiopian governments signed a treaty in 1907, reaffirmed by a 1970 Ethiopia- Kenya treaty. The Ethiopia-Sudan boundary, the \\"Maud Line\\", was surveyed by Captain Philip Maud of the Royal Engineers in 1902–03. It was adopted by Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement treaty of December 6, 1907 between Ethiopia and British East Africa. Though vague on the precise details of where the Kenya- Sudan border was located, it clearly placed the entire Ilemi on the west side of the Ethiopia-Sudan line. In 1914 the Uganda-Sudan Boundary Commission agreement provided Sudan access to Lake Turkana via the now-dry Sanderson Gulf at the southeast corner of the Ilemi (at the time Lake Turkana was the border between the British territories of Uganda and Kenya). After World War I, the Ethiopians armed the Nyangatom and Dassanech peoples, whereby the traditional raids turned into battles where hundreds died. = 1920s = Sudan in 1928 agreed to allow Kenyan military units across the 1914 line to protect the Turkana against the Dassanech and Nyangatom, although it cost £30,000 per year. In 1929 Kenya began subsidising Sudan to occupy the territory, which it did not wish to continue because of the perceived useless nature of it. In 1931 it was Sudan which agreed to subsidise Kenya to occupy the territory. The Ilemi Triangle in different maps = 1930s = In 1931 the Red Line (the Glenday Line) was drawn to represent the northern boundary of Turkana grazing. \\"In a series of agreements from 1929 to 1934, the Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the Governor of Kenya agreed that this Red Line should be accepted as the Turkana grazing boundary.\\"The Ilemi Triangle 'Sovereigntyscape' After Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1936, Italy briefly claimed the area of the Ilemi triangle. A joint Kenya-Sudan survey team in 1938 demarcated the \\"Red Line\\" or \\"Wakefield Line\\", very close to the delimitation a few years earlier of this Red Line, marking the northern limit of grazing of Turkana. While Egypt and Britain agreed on this, Italy did not. The Dassanetch and Nyangatom had suffered because of the Italian occupation, and wished to recoup their losses by making a raid against the Turkana. Several hundred Turkana people were killed in a raid in July 1939 by the Nyangatom and Dassanech peoples. Italy gave up their claim on the Ilemi subsequently, and allowed the British to respond with a raid on the Inyangatom and Dassanech supported by the Royal Air Force. = 1940s = British troops of the King's African Rifles occupied Ilemi in 1941 after the East African Campaign during World War II. The KAR passed through Ilemi on their way to southwestern Ethiopia. In 1944 Britain's Foreign Office surveyed a \\"blue line\\" which was further northwest than the \\"red line\\". = 1950s = Sudan, in 1950, established their own patrol line even further northwest into Sudan up to the border with Ethiopia, where they prohibited Kenyan and Ethiopian pastoralists from moving west of it, giving up policing and development to the area east of it. However, that Kenya-Sudan agreement specified that this patrol line in no way affected sovereignty; that it was not an international boundary, and money continued to be paid to Kenya to patrol this Sudanese territory. There was fighting between 1949 and 1953 as Sudan attempted to keep the Nyangatom behind this line. After Sudanese independence in 1956, Sudan has not administered Ilemi or much of the southern part of the country due to the First Sudanese Civil War which began all over southern Sudan. = 1960s and 1970s = In 1967 President Jomo Kenyatta's administration had made overtures to the British in order to secure support for the cession of the Triangle to Kenya. The British were unresponsive and the results amounted to little. The matter was sidelined and successive Kenyan administrations have been seemingly willing to accept the territorial status quo and their de facto territorial control, even if the Kenyan influence did diminish after the relocation of the Sudan People's Liberation Army to Sudan in the 1980s–90s. A 1978 topographic map of the Ilemi triangle, showing the \\"Maud line\\" as the only international border. In 1964 Kenya and Ethiopia reaffirmed their boundary, confirming Kenyan sovereignty to Namuruputh, which is just south of the southeastern point of the triangle. In 1972 a Sudan-Ethiopia boundary alteration did not solve the Ilemi issue because it did not involve Kenya, but did confirm that Ethiopia had no claim to the Ilemi Triangle. In 1978 Kenya began to publicly, unilaterally regard the Turkana grazing line of 1938 (Wakefield Line) as an international boundary between Kenya and Sudan. = 1980s = In 1986, Kenya began to widely circulate a new map which for the first time displayed the Ilemi Triangle as an integral part of its territory (no longer displaying the straight horizontal \\"Maud line\\"). = 1990s to present = In the 1990s Ethiopia armed the Dassanech with Kalashnikov automatic rifles, perhaps in response to Kenyan government arming in 1978 of the Turkana. Beginning in the 1960s, many Kenyan maps have marked the Red Line as the official boundary of Kenya, rather than a dotted boundary which it had been previously. More recently, many Kenyan maps depict the 1950 patrol line, the furthest northwest, as the boundary. There was a question as to whether a secret agreement was broached between Kenya and South Sudan to allow Kenya to administer this territory, in return for support in the Sudanese Civil War.Collins, Robert O. Civil wars and revolution in the Sudan: essays on the Sudan, Southern Sudan and Darfur, 1962 - 2004. Tsehai Publishers, 2005, , pg. 373. In recent decades, the countries involved have had other priorities, delaying a resolution to the issue. The recent discovery of oil in the region also complicates resolution. With the independence of South Sudan in 2011, the Sudanese claim to the Ilemi Triangle was transferred to the new national government in Juba.

Biography Bregman was born and raised in Israel. He served in the Israel Defense Forces and as an artillery officer participated in the 1978 Litani campaign and the 1982 Lebanon War. After the war he left the army to study international relations and political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He also worked as a parliamentary assistant in the Knesset. After giving an interview in 1988 to the Haaretz newspaper declaring that he would refuse to serve as a military reservist in the Israeli-occupied territories, he left Israel and settled in England. There he joined the Department of War Studies, King's College London, and completed his PhD in 1994. Bregman is the writer of several books and articles on the Arab–Israeli conflict and Middle Eastern Affairs. Since 1994 he has been the Daily Telegraph writer of obituaries, covering the Jewish world and Israel. A senior teaching fellow at the Department of War Studies and a journalist, Bregman lives in London. He has three children. Marwan Affair In 2002, Bregman claimed that the Egyptian Ashraf Marwan, the son-in-law of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, was a Mossad spy. According to Bregman, Marwan volunteered for the Mossad in 1970 but then proceeded to mislead the Israelis before the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Although Marwan insisted that Bregman's claim was \\"a stupid detective story\\", they became friends and Marwan made Bregman a consultant on his memoirs. On 27 June 2007, the day that Bregman and Marwan were due to meet up in central London, Marwan's body was discovered in a small rose garden, just under the balcony of his London flat. A police investigation failed to establish whether Marwan was pushed or jumped. In 2016, Bregman published a book titled The Spy who Fell to Earth on his relationship with Marwan. In December 2017, Salon Pictures purchased the rights to turn it into a feature documentary. \\"The Bregman collection\\", which includes papers and tapes related to the Marwan Affair, is kept at the Liddell Hart Archives, King's College London. A documentary about Ashraf Marwan and Bregman's work, The Spy Who Fell to Earth, came out on Netflix in April 2019.

The hydroxamic acid derivative is first converted to its conjugate base by abstraction of a hydrogen by a base. Spontaneous rearrangement releases a carboxylate anion to produce the isocyanate intermediate. The isocyanate is then hydrolyzed in the presence of H2O.

It premiered on Canada's Teletoon animation channel. Delilah and Julius was produced by Decode Entertainment and Collideascope Digital Productions. 52 episodes were produced. The series is centered on a pair of highly trained young adults, Delilah and Julius, who were both orphaned children of special agents. Together, they graduated from the Academy, a training facility headed by Al, a free-spirited special agent who brought the duo together, and fight international crime and a myriad of villains as a pair of savvy, well-trained spies. Characters =Main characters= As a team, Delilah and Julius are both gifted musicians, masters of disguise, martial arts experts and fluent in 20 languages. Still, they are both consummate professionals always seeking to improve their game. They seem to like each other, too. Delilah and Julius have had many \\"dates\\" like missions. Delilah Devonshire Delilah Devonshire has a very determined personality and is eager for truth. In fact, Delilah's greatest quality is her commitment to truth. It's also what gets her into trouble. She takes things seriously but she can break down easily in certain situations. Her spy parents went missing when she was only five and are presumed dead. Delilah refuses to believe this, however, and she is determined to find out anything she can about them and to prove the rumors wrong that her parents were double agents. Delilah's relationship with Julius is very important to her and she is very touchy and gets jealous when Julius flirts with other girls (especially Ice). She appreciates having a capable partner in Julius, and together they will stop at nothing to keep the villains from carrying out their evil plots on mankind. She believes in breaking her opponent down from the inside out. She gets inside the villain's head and she loves a new challenge. Delilah is strong-willed, inventive, resourceful, quick thinking and graceful. She is experienced in fencing, etiquette and explosives, and always has time to learn something new that may be useful on a mission. Julius Chevalier Julius Chevalier is often flippant but is very determined and has a passion for crime fighting. Where Delilah is more goal-oriented, Julius is more spontaneous. He deals with situations as they happen and still manages to find the time to have fun. He enjoys surfing, poetry, safe cracking and yoga. His parents were killed in action when he was only four, and Julius would love to avenge their deaths. For now, he is comforted by the fact that they were considered two of the greatest spies of all time. Julius is a laid back guy and a little cocky. This confidence allows him to act on the fly. He has a dash of James Bond in that he is not easily ruffled, thinks fast, and makes it all look easy. He has a good sense of humor and is very intuitive when it comes to the needs of his partner, Delilah. Beneath a nonchalant, arrogant exterior lies a sensitive and caring guy – especially towards Delilah. He is calm and resourceful under pressure, but tends to be a bit careless when the pressure is off. He often tries to impress Delilah, and becomes extremely jealous and petty when she shows interest in other boys. It is proved in one episode that he is in love with Delilah as it is shown what he is dreaming about. =The Academy Crew= Alfred \\"Al\\" The director of the Academy, Al is always highly informed and gives Delilah and Julius their mission assignments. Al's not only their primary contact, guide and teacher, but he is also a parental figure for Delilah and Julius. A free spirited individual, Al talks like a mid-70's Californian surfer/hippie. He is passionate for food and culture and has a unique sense of humour, but can also be serious, especially when it comes to keeping his students safe. Scarlett Vance Scarlett is the Academy's gadget guru. Like Al, Scarlett is prone to using anachronistic 70's expressions as well as cares a lot about her students. She is extremely inventive and always coming up with new spy technology that keep Delilah and Julius on top of their missions Buster \\"Nosey\\" A frequent partner of Delilah and Julius, he is a well-meaning, good-hearted goof with a reputation for being a stink magnet. It's not that he is naturally stinky, he is just inevitably drawn into very smelly situations on his missions. Nosey seems to be attracted to Zoe, a new member of the Academy. Ursula and Emmet Another one of Al's arranged spy teams, Ursula and Emmet are the rivals of Delilah and Julius who are jealous of their popularity and success. Ursula is also a double agent working under cover at the Academy for an unknown evil foe. Supposedly Dr. Dismay. Zoe Ling Zoe is the newest spy at the Academy. She loves reading comics and knows them all by heart. When Zoe first arrives at the Academy, she thinks Julius is cute. However, a relationship with Nosey is hinted throughout a few episodes. Zoe is a redhead and has a rather feisty personality which is the stereo typical attitude most redheads have. Her spy skills are well-developed and the Academy Crew seems to trust this newcomer. =Villains= * Dr. Dismay: Dr. Dismay is a young, handsome doctor bent on world domination who tries hard to break the stereotypical mold of a mad scientist. With his evil sidekick \\"Nurse\\" he tries to stop Delilah and Julius using his bad medication. * Professor Dismay: An evil genius and father of Dr. Dismay. * Dexter Jeremy Hook \\"DJ Hook\\": An internationally-known DJ tries to dominate the world. A big advantage for him is that he can hypnotize people with his music. Delilah and Julius can usually maneuver around it and stop the evil DJ. * Ms. Deeds: The leader of a crime syndicate specializing in cybercrime. * Ice: A master manipulator of earth science who also has her eyes on Julius. * Wednesday Kertsfield: A young socialite who uses her money to try to take over the world. * Conman: A master of disguise, he is behind some of the biggest scams ever committed against humanity. Nobody has ever seen his real face, not even any of his many kidnapping victims. Delilah and Julius uncovered his face, but instead of having a face the conman wore a permanent mask. * Baguio Joe: A volatile weatherman who really controls the weather. * Gilly Hippodrome: A mutant who hates normal-looking people. He is also the leader of a group of freaks masquerading as a circus, where he is the \\"Clown Prince\\". * Ursula: Although a member of the academy, she is working as a double agent. * Tibor: He is after the zero list and is also Julius' brother. * Sunshine: Ice's twin sister and a villain with a fiery attitude * Dollface and Roy: A woman who is part-robot, part-human, and wants to take over the world with her \\"husband\\", full-time robot, Roy. She wants the entire world to be of robots, and no humans at all. * Evil Eye and Francis: Evil eye lost his eye while trying to escape from the police, and he believes that he lost it because of Delilah. Francis is his sidekick. Episodes Two seasons were produced, each consisting of 26 episodes. Each season includes a three- part finale, originally aired together under one title but later as separate episodes. \\"The Underground\\" is the pilot episode for the series. =Series overview= =Season 1 (2005–06)= =Season 2 (2007–08)= Production Development of the series began in early 2002, with 13 episodes budgeted at US$200,000–300,000 each.

German–American relations are the historic relations between Germany and the United States at the official level, including diplomacy, alliances and warfare. The topic also includes economic relations such as trade and investments, demography and migration, and cultural and intellectual interchanges since the 1680s. The nations fought against each other in two world wars. In the late 1940s, the U.S. occupied western Germany (along with the United Kingdom and France) and built a demilitarized democratic society. West Germany achieved independence in 1949. It joined NATO with the understanding that its safety being long dependent on the military might and strategic reliability of the United States. Germany had outsourced its security to the U.S. and NATO. East Germany became a Soviet satellite. After Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe in 1989, Germany was reunified with American support. It became an economic and political powerhouse in Europe and a close ally of the United States. However relations cooled after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.  Overview  Before 1900, the main factors in German-American relations were very large movements of immigrants from Germany to American states (especially Pennsylvania, the Midwest, and central Texas) throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries.A.B. Faust, The German Element in the United States with Special Reference to Its Political, Moral, Social, and Educational Influence. (2 vol 1909), vol 1.. There also was a significant movement of philosophical ideas that influenced American thinking. German achievements in public schooling and higher education greatly impressed American educators; the American education system was based on the Prussian education system. Thousands of American advanced students, especially scientists and historians, studied at elite German universities. There was little movement in the other direction: few Americans ever moved permanently to Germany, and few German intellectuals studied in America or moved to the United States before 1933. Economic relations were of minor importance before 1920. Diplomatic relations were friendly but of minor importance to either side before the 1870s.Hans Wilhelm Gatzke, Germany and the United States, a \\"special Relationship?\\" (Harvard UP, 1980). After the Unification of Germany in 1871, Germany became a major world power. Both nations built world-class navies and began imperialistic expansion around the world. That led to a small-scale conflict over the Samoan islands: the Second Samoan Civil War. A crisis in 1898, when Germany and the United States disputed over who should take control, was resolved with the Tripartite Convention in 1899 when the two nations divided up Samoa between them to end the conflict.Paul M. Kennedy, The Samoan Tangle: A Study in Anglo-German-American Relations 1878–1900 (University of Queensland Press, 2013). After 1898, the US itself became much more involved in international diplomacy and found itself sometimes in disagreement but more often in agreement with Germany. In the early 20th century, the rise of the powerful German Navy and its role in Latin America and the Caribbean troubled American military strategists. Relations were sometimes tense, as in the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, but all incidents were peacefully resolved.Holger H. Herwig, Politics of frustration: the United States in German naval planning, 1889–1941 (1976). The US tried to remain neutral in the First World War, but it provided far more trade and financial support to Britain and the Allies, which controlled the Atlantic routes. Germany worked to undermine American interests in Mexico. In 1917, the German offer of a military alliance against the US in the Zimmermann Telegram contributed to the American decision for war.Thomas Boghardt, The Zimmermann telegram: intelligence, diplomacy, and America's entry into World War I (Naval Institute Press, 2012). German submarine attacks on British shipping, especially the sinking of the passenger liner Lusitania without allowing the civilian passengers to reach the lifeboats, outraged US public opinion. Germany agreed to US demands to stop such attacks but reversed its position in early 1917 to win the war quickly since it mistakenly thought that the US military was too weak to play a decisive role. The US public opposed the punitive 1919 Versailles Treaty, and both countries signed a separate peace treaty in 1921. In the 1920s, American diplomats and bankers provided major assistance to rebuilding the German economy. When Hitler and the Nazis took power in 1933, American public opinion was highly negative. Relations between the two nations turned sour after 1938. Large numbers of intellectuals, scientists, and artists found refuge from the Nazis in the United States, but American immigration policy strictly limited the number of Jewish refugees. The US provided significant military and financial aid to Britain and France. Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and Washington made the defeat of Nazi Germany its highest priority. The United States played a major role in the occupation and reconstruction of Germany after 1945. The USs provided billions of dollars in aid by the Marshall Plan to rebuild the West German economy. The two nations relationship became very positive, in terms of democratic ideals, anti-communism, and high levels of economic trade. Today, the US is one of Germany's closest allies and partners outside of the European Union. The people of the two countries see each other as reliable allies but disagree on some key policy issues. Americans want Germany to play a more active military role, but Germans strongly disagree.\\"Germany and the United States: Reliable Allies: But Disagreement on Russia, Global Leadership and Trade,\\" Pew Research Center: Global Attitudes and Trends 7 May, 2015  History  = German immigration to the United States = Self-reported ancestry of the population of the United States (by countries, 2001) Largest self-reported ancestries in the United States (2000) For over three centuries, immigration from Germany accounted for a large share of all American immigrants. As of the 2000 US Census, more than 20% of all Americans, and 25% of white Americans, claim German descent. German-Americans are an assimilated group which influences political life in the US as a whole. They are the most common self-reported ethnic group in the Northern United States, especially in the Midwest. In most of the South, German Americans are less common, with the exception of Florida and Texas.  1683–1848  The first records of German immigration date back to the 17th century and the foundation of Germantown, now part of Philadelphia, in 1683. Immigration from Germany reached its first peak between 1749 and 1754, when approximately 37,000 Germans came to North America.  1848–1914  Since 1848, about seven million Germans have emigrated to the United States. Many of them settled in the cities of Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit and New York City. The failed German Revolutions of 1848 into 1849 (accompanied by similar upheavals that same pivotal year in the rest of Europe) accelerated emigration from Germany and the German Confederation. Those Germans who left as a result of the revolution were called the Forty-Eighters. Between the revolution and the start of World War I (1914–1918), over 70 years later, over one million Germans settled in the United States. They endured hardship as a result of overcrowded ships, and typhus fever spread rapidly throughout the ships due to the cramped conditions. On average, it took Germans six months to get to the New World, and many died on the journey. By 1890 more than 40 percent of the population of the cities of Cleveland, Milwaukee, Hoboken and Cincinnati were of German origin. By the end of the 19th century, Germans formed the largest self- described ethnic group in the United States and their customs became a strong element in American society and culture. Political participation of German- Americans was focused on involvement in the labor movement. Germans in America had a strong influence on the labor movement in the United States. Newly- founded labor unions enabled German immigrants to improve their working conditions and to integrate into American society.  Since 1914  A combination of patriotism and anti-German sentiment along with civil strife during both world wars caused most German-Americans to cut their former ties and assimilate into mainstream American culture with disbanding of German cultural, genealogical, and historical groups; the study and teaching of the German language and history in high schools, colleges, universities; and the removal of several German-related monuments and placenames. During Nazi Germany and the Third Reich (1933–1945) before and during World War II (1939–1945), Germany had another major emigration wave of German Jews and other political anti-Nazi refugees leaving the Reich and even the continent. Today, German-Americans form the largest self-reported ancestry group in the United States with California and Pennsylvania having the highest number of German Americans. = Diplomacy and trade = During the American Revolution (1775–1783), King Frederick the Great of Prussia strongly hated the British, who had abandoned him in 1761, during the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). He now favored France and impeded Britain's war effort in subtle ways, such as blocking the passage of Hessians soldiers. However, the importance of British trade and the risk of attack from Austria made him pursue a peace policy and maintain an official strict neutrality.Paul Leland Haworth, \\"Frederick the Great and the American Revolution\\" American Historical Review (1904) 9#3 pp. 460–478 open access in JSTORHenry Mason Adams, Prussian-American Relations: 1775–1871 (1960). After the war, direct trade between the American ports of Baltimore, Norfolk, and Philadelphia and the old Hanseatic League ports of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck grew steadily. Americans exported tobacco, rice, cotton, sugar, imported textiles, metal products, colognes, brandies, and toiletries. The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) and increasing instability in the German Confederation states led to a decline in the economic relationships between the United States and the Hanse. The level of trade never came close to matching the trade with Britain and faltered because the US delayed a commercial treaty until 1827. US diplomacy was ineffective, but the commercial consuls, local businessmen, handled their work so well that the US successfully developed diplomatic ties with Prussia. However, trade was minimal.Sam A. Mustafa, Merchants and Migrations: Germans and Americans in Connection, 1776–1835 (2001) It was the Kingdom of Prussia under Frederick William III that took the initiative in sending a trade experts to Washington, DC, in 1834. The first permanent American diplomat came in 1835, when Henry Wheaton was sent to Prussia. The United States Secretary of State said that \\"not a single point of controversy exists between the two countries calling for adjustment; and that their commercial intercourse, based upon treaty stipulations, is conducted upon those liberal and enlightened principles of reciprocity... which are gradually making their way against the narrow prejudices and blighting influences of the prohibitive system.\\"Manfred Jonas, The United States and Germany (1985) p 17 During the American Civil War (1861–1865), all of the German states favored the northern Union but played no major role. After 1871 In 1876, the German commissioner for the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia stated that the German armaments, machines, arts, and crafts on display were of inferior quality to British and American products. Germany industrialized rapidly after unification under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1870–1871, but its competition was more with Britain than with the US. It bought increasing amounts of American farm products, especially cotton, wheat and tobacco, but tried to block American meat.Andrew Bonnell, \\"'Cheap and Nasty': German Goods, Socialism, and the 1876 Philadelphia World Fair.\\" International Review of Social History 46#2 (2001): 207–226. Porkwar and protectionism In 1880, ten European countries (Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Spain, France, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Romania, and Denmark) imposed a ban on importation of American pork in the 1880s. They pointed to vague reports of trichinosis that supposedly originated with American hogs.Uwe Spiekermann, \\"Dangerous Meat? German-American Quarrels Over Pork And Beef, 1870–1900\\" Bulletin of the GHI vol 46 (Spring 2010) online At issue was over 1.3 billion pounds of pork products in 1880, with a value of $100 million annually. European farmers were angry at cheap American food overrunning their home markets for wheat, pork, and beef; demanded for their governments to fight back; and called for a boycott. European manufacturing interests were also threatened by growing American industrial exports, and were angry at the high American tariff on imports from European factories. Chancellor Bismarck took a hard line, rejected the pro-trade German businessmen, and refused to join in scientific studies proposed by President Chester A. Arthur. American investigations reported that American pork was safe. Bismarck, because of his political base of German landowners, insisted on protection and ignored the leading German expert, Professor Rudolf Virchow, who condemned the embargo as unjustified.Louis L. Snyder, \\"The American-German Pork Dispute, 1879-1891.\\" Journal of Modern History 17.1 (1945): 16-28. onlineJohn L. Gignilliat, \\"Pigs, Politics, and Protection: The European Boycott of American Pork, 1879-1891,\\" Agricultural History 35.1 (1961): 3-12. online American public opinion grew angry at Berlin. President Grover Cleveland rejected retaliation, but it was threatened by his successor, Benjamin Harrison, who charged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and William Walter Phelps, minister to Germany, to end the boycott without delay. Harrison also persuaded Congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act of 1890 to guarantee the quality of the export product. The president used his Agriculture Secretary Jeremiah McLain Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation by initiating an embargo against Germany's popular beet sugar. That proved decisive for Germany to relent in September 1891. Other nations soon followed, and the boycott was soon over.Homer E. Socolofsky and Allan B. Spetter, The Presidency of Benjamin Harrison (1987). pp 131-36.Suellen Hoy, and Walter Nugent. \\"Public health or protectionism?

Bismarck himself distrusted imperialism, but he reversed course in the face of public and elite opinion that favored imperialistic expansion around the world. In 1889, the US, Britain and Germany were locked in an petty dispute over control of the Samoan Islands, in the Pacific. The issue emerged in 1887 when the Germans tried to establish control over the island chain and President Cleveland responded by sending three naval vessels to defend the Samoan government. American and German warships faced off but all were badly damaged by the 1889 Apia cyclone of March 15–17, 1889.Noah Andre Trudeau, \\"'An Appalling Calamity'--In the teeth of the Great Samoan Typhoon of 1889, a standoff between the German and US navies suddenly didn't matter.\\" Naval History Magazine 25.2 (2011): 54-59. The delegates agreed to meet in Berlin to resolve the crisis. Chancellor Bismarck decided to ignore the small issues involved and improve relations with Washington and London. The result was the Treaty of Berlin, which established a three-power protectorate in Samoa. The three powers agreed to Western Samoa's independence and neutrality. Historian George H. Ryden argues that Harrison played a key role in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations, which included the selection of the local ruler, the refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, and the establishment of the three-power protectorate, a first for the U.S.Homer E. Socolofsky and Allan B. Spetter, The Presidency of Benjamin Harrison (1987). pp. 114-16.George Herbert Ryden, The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa (1933). A serious long-term result was an American distrust of Germany's foreign policy after Bismarck was forced out in 1890.Walter LaFeber, The New Empire: An Interpretation of American Expansion, 1860–1898 (1963) pp 138-40, 323.When unrest continued, international tensions flared in 1899.

Kennedy, The Samoan Tangle: A Study in Anglo-German- American Relations 1878–1900 (2013).  Caribbean  In the late 19th century, the Kaiserliche Marine (German Navy) sought to establish a coaling station somewhere in the Caribbean Sea area. Imperial Germany was rapidly building a blue-water navy, but coal-burning warships needed frequent refueling and so needed to operate within range of a coaling station. Preliminary plans were vetoed by Bismarck, who did not want to antagonize the US, but he was ousted in 1890 by the new emperor, Wilhelm II, and the Germans kept looking. German naval planners from 1890 to 1910 denounced the 1820s Monroe Doctrine as a self-aggrandizing legal pretension and were even more concerned with the possible American canal at Panama, in Central America, as it would lead to full American hegemony in the Caribbean. The stakes were laid out in the German war aims proposed by the German Navy in 1903: a \\"firm position in the West Indies,\\" a \\"free hand in South America,\\" and an official \\"revocation of the Monroe Doctrine\\" would provide a solid foundation for \\"our trade to the West Indies, Central and South America.\\" By 1900, American \\"naval planners were obsessed with German designs in the Western Hemisphere and countered with energetic efforts to secure naval sites in the Caribbean.\\" In the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, Britain and Germany sent warships to blockade Venezuela after it defaulted on its foreign loan repayments. Germany intended to land troops and occupy Venezuelan ports, but US President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909) forced the Germans to back down by sending his own fleet and threatening war if the Germans landed.Edmund Morris, \\"'A Matter Of Extreme Urgency' Theodore Roosevelt, Wilhelm II, and the Venezuela Crisis of 1902,\\" Naval War College Review (2002) 55#2 pp 73–85 By 1904, German naval strategists had turned its attention to Mexico, where they hoped to establish a naval base in a Mexican port on the Caribbean. They dropped that plan, but it became active again after 1911, the start of the Mexican Revolution and subsequent Mexican Civil War.Friedrich Katz, Secret War in Mexico: Europe, the United States and the Mexican Revolution (1981), pp. 50–64 = 1900-1919 = Venezuelan defaulted on its foreign loan repayments in 1902, and Britain and Germany sent warships to blockade its ports and force repayment.

The Venezuela episode focused American attention on Kaiser William II, who was increasingly erratic and aggressive. The media highlighted his militarism and belligerent speeches and imperialistic goals. At the same time, the British were becoming increasingly friendly toward the United States in world affairs. American opinion became more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.Harry Elmer Barnes, The Genesis of the World War (1925) pp. 590–591 World War I New York Times April 3, 1917 World War I started in August 1914, and the US insisted on neutrality. US President Woodrow Wilson's highest priority was to broker peace talks and used his trusted aide, Colonel House. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for Britain, US public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans, and Scandinavian Americans as well as poor white southern farmers, cultural leaders, Protestant churchmen, and women in general. The British argument that the Allies were defending civilization against a German militaristic onslaught gained support after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and, following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, US citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor who had to be stopped. Former President Theodore Roosevelt and many Republicans were war hawks, and demanded rapid American armament Wilson insisted on neutrality and minimized wartime preparations to be able to negotiate for peace. After the British ship Lusitania was sunk, with over 100 American passengers drowned, Wilson demanded for German submarines to allow passengers and crew to reach their lifeboats before ships were sunk. Germany reluctantly agreed, but in January 1917, it decided that a massive infantry attack on the Western Front, coupled with a full-scale attack on all food shipments to Europe, would prove decisive. It realized the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare almost certainly meant war with the United States, but it calculated that the U.S. Armed Forces would take years to mobilize and arrive, when Germany would have already won. Germany reached out to Mexico with the Zimmermann Telegram, offering a military alliance against the United States, hoping the United States would diverge most of its attention to attacking Mexico. London intercepted the telegram, the contents of which outraged American opinion.Thomas A. Bailey, A Diplomatic History of the American People (10th edition 1980) pp 563-95. online. World War I propaganda poster for enlistment in the U.S. Army Wilson called on Congress to declare war on Germany in April 1917. The United States expected to provide money, munitions, food, and raw materials but did not expect to send large troop contingents until it realized how weak the Allies were on the Western Front. After the exit of Russia from the war in late 1917, Germany could reallocate 600,000 experienced troops to the Western Front. but by summer, American troops were arriving at the rate of 10,000 a day, every day, replacing all the Allied losses while the German Army shrank day by day until it finally collapsed in November 1918. On the homefront, the loyalty of German-Americans was frequently challenged. Any significant German cultural impact was seen with intense hostility and suspicion. Germany was portrayed as a threat to American freedom and way of life. Inside Germany, the United States was another enemy and denounced as a false liberator that wanted to dominate Europe itself. As the war ended, however, the German people embraced Wilsonian promises of the just peace treaty. At the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Wilson used his enormous prestige and co-operated with British Prime Minister David Lloyd George to block some of the harshest French demands against Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. Wilson devoted most of his attention to establishing the League of Nations, which he felt would end all wars. He also signed a treaty with France and Britain to guarantee American support to prevent Germany from invading France again. Wilson refused all compromises with the Republicans, who controlled Congress, and so the United States neither ratified the Treaty of Versailles nor joined the League of Nations.Bailey, A Diplomatic History of the American People (1980) pp 596-613. = Interwar period =  1920s  Economic and diplomatic relations were positive during the 1920s. The US government rejected the harsh anti-German Versailles Treaty of 1920, signed a new peace treaty that involved no punishment for Germany, and worked with Britain to create a viable Euro- Atlantic peace system.Patrick O.

Ambassador Alanson B. Houghton (1922–1925) believed that world peace, European stability, and American prosperity depended upon a reconstruction of Europe's economy and political systems. He saw his role as promoting American political engagement with Europe. He overcame US opposition and lack of interest and quickly realized that the central issues of the day were all entangled in economics, especially war debts owed by the Allies to the United States, reparations owed by Germany to the Allies, worldwide inflation, and international trade and investment. Solutions, he believed, required new US policies and close co-operation with Britain and Germany. He was a leading promoter of the Dawes Plan.Jeffrey J. Matthews, Alanson B. Houghton: ambassador of the new era (2004) pp 48–49. Although the high culture of Germany looked down upon American culture, jazz was widely accepted by the younger generation.

German influence on American society was limited during that period. The flow of migration into the United States was small, and young American scholars seldom attended German universities for graduate work. The U.S. government took the lead through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan.Frank Costigliola, \\"The United States and the Reconstruction of Germany in the 1920s.\\" Business History Review 50#4 (1976): 477–502.

Nazi era 1933–41  Public opinion in the US was strongly negative toward Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, but there was also a strong aversion to war and to entanglement in European politics.Steven Casey, Cautious crusade: Franklin D. Roosevelt, American public opinion, and the war against Nazi Germany (2001). The Roosevelt administration publicly hailed the Munich Agreement of 1938 for avoiding war but privately realized it was only a postponement that called for rapid rearming. Formal relations were cool until November 1938 and then turned very cold. The key event was American revulsion against Kristallnacht, the nationwide German assault on Jews and Jewish institutions. Religious groups which had been pacifistic also turned hostile.Maria Mazzenga, American religious responses to Kristallnacht (2009). While the total flow of refugees from Germany to the US was relatively small during the 1930s, many intellectuals escaped and resettled in the United States.Donald Fleming and Bernard Bailyn, eds.

Barkley views the bodies of prisoners at a liberated Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1945 As World War II began with the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the US was officially neutral until December 11, 1941 when Germany declared war on the US.. Roosevelt's foreign policy strongly favored Britain, France and the other European democracies over Germany in 1939 to 1941. The US played a central role in the defeat of the Axis powers and so relations between Berlin and Washington, DC, were inevitably at their lowest point. Germany used American participation as one of the leaders of the Allies for extensive propaganda value, and the infamous \\"LIBERATORS\\" poster from 1944 may be the most powerful example. In contrast, Roosevelt was, as early as mid-March 1941,Roosevelt, Franklin Delano \\"On U.S. Involvement in the War in Europe\\" (speech) Washington, D.C. (March 15, 1941) quite acutely aware of Hitler's views about the United States, but Roosevelt needed to balance the dueling issues of preparing the United States for its likely involvement in a global conflict and the continuing strong desire by many Americans to avoid war at all costs until the consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor settled the issue. In the aforementioned poster, which is shown in this article, the United States was depicted as a monstrous, vicious war machine seeking to destroy European culture. The poster alluded to many negative aspects of American history, including the Ku Klux Klan, the oppression of Native Americans, and the lynching of blacks. The poster condemned American capitalism and America's perceived dominance by Judaism and showed American bombs destroying a helpless European village. However, the US launched several propaganda campaigns in return towards Nazi Germany that often portrayed Nazi Germany as a warmongering country, with inferior morals and brainwashing schemes. =Cold War= Following the defeat of the Third Reich, American forces were one of the occupation powers in postwar Germany. In parallel to denazification and \\"industrial disarmament\\" American citizens fraternized with Germans. The Berlin Airlift from 1948–1949 and the Marshall Plan (1948–1952) further improved the Germans' perception of Americans. West Germany John F. Kennedy meeting with Willy Brandt, in the White House, March 13, 1961. The emergence of the Cold War made the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) the frontier of a democratic Western Europe and American military presence became an integral part in West German society. The US presence may have helped smooth over possibly awkward postwar relationships if they had not come under the aegis of the biggest intact army and economy. That lessened the lag before the formation of the precursors to today's EU and may be seen as a silent benefit of Pax Americana. During the Cold War, West Germany developed into the largest economy in Europe and West German-US relations developed into a new transatlantic partnership. Germany and the US shared a large portion of their culture, established intensive global trade environment, and continued to co-operate on new high technologies. However, tensions remained between differing approaches on both sides of the Atlantic. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent German reunification marked a new era in German- American co-operation. East Germany popular image of Native Americans made Indian living history quite popular in communist East Germany Relations between the United States and East Germany were hostile. The United States followed the Adenauer's Hallstein Doctrine of 1955, which declared that recognition by any country of East Germany would be treated as an unfriendly act by West Germany. Relations between the two Germanies thawed somewhat in the 1970s, as part of the overall détente between East and West. United States recognized East Germany officially in September 1974, when Erich Honecker was the leader of the ruling Socialist Unity Party. To ward off the risk of internal liberalization on his regime, Honecker enlarged the Stasi from 43,000 to 60,000 agents. East Germany imposed an official ideology that was reflected in all its media and all the schools. The official line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Adolf Hitler and had become the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the \\"terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street.\\" East Germans had a heroic role to play as a frontline against the evil Americans. However few Germans believed it since had seen enough of the Soviets since 1945, and half-a-million Soviets were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, East Germans were exposed to information from relatives in the West, Radio Free Europe broadcasts from the US, and the West German media. The official Communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and rock 'n roll. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The choice was to comply or to flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the Berlin Wall of 1961.Rainer Schnoor, \\"The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR,\\" in Detlef Junker, et al. eds. The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945–1968: A Handbook, Vol. 2: 1968–1990 (2004) p. 618, quotation on page 619. Americans saw East Germany simply as a puppet of Moscow, with no independent possibilities. Map showing the division of East and West Germany until 1990, with West Berlin in yellow. =Reunification 1989-1990= President George H. W. Bush (1989–1993) played a large part by his constant support of unification, and keeping the unified Germany committed to NATO.Jeffrey A. Engel, When the World Seemed New: George H. W. Bush and the End of the Cold War (2018) pp. 273–291. While Britain and France were wary of a re-unified Germany, Bush strongly supported West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in pushing for rapid German reunification in 1990. Bush believed that a reunified Germany would serve U.S. interests, but he also saw reunification as providing a final symbolic end to World War II.Jon Meacham, Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush (2015), pp. 397–408 After extensive negotiations, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to allow a reunified Germany to be a part of NATO, and Germany officially reunified in October 1990. Faced with the challenge of convincing Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union of the merits of a unified Germany, Bush successfully induced all of them to accept a united Germany with a Western orientation in government, foreign affairs, and economy. This was a situation previously considered unthinkable, given the previous status of the Soviet Union, but it was made feasible by the time of the fall of the East German regime.John Robert Greene, The Presidency of George Bush (2nd ed. 2015) pp. 134–137.Philip D. Zelikow, and Condoleezza Rice. Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft (1995) excerpt Bush paid attention to domestic public opinion. Serious doubts about reunification were voiced by the Jewish-American and Polish-American communities--whose families had suffered immensely from German fascism. However, the largely positive public opinion towards German unification in the United States generally corresponded to the sentiments of the usually passive German-American community.Lukas Schemper, \\"Diasporas and American debates on German unification.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 15.1 (2017): 41-60 online. = Reunified Germany = During the early 1990s, the reunified Germany was called a \\"partnership in leadership\\" as the US emerged as the world's sole superpower. Germany's effort to incorporate any major military actions into the slowly-progressing European Security and Defence Policy did not meet the expectations of the U.S. during the Gulf War. After the September 11 attacks, German-American political relations were strengthened in an effort to combat terrorism, and Germany sent troops to Afghanistan as part of the NATO force. Yet, discord continued over the Iraq War, when German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made efforts to prevent war and did not join the US and the UK, which both led multinational force in Iraq.Joschka Fischer interviewed by Gero von Boehm; originally broadcast on 3Sat in 2010; version with English subtitles on YouTube Anti-Americanism rose to the surface after the attacks of 11 September 2001 as hostile German intellectuals argued there were ugly links between globalization, Americanization, and terrorism.Gerrit-Jan Berendse, \\"German anti-Americanism in context.\\" Journal of European Studies 33#3–4 (2003): 333–350. Protestors rally against National Security Agency's mass surveillance, Berlin, June 2013 In response to the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures, Germany cancelled the 1968 intelligence sharing agreement with the US and UK. In May 2017, Angela Merkel met with US President Donald Trump. Trump's statements that the U.S. had been taken advantage of in trade deals during previous administrations had already strained relations with several EU countries and other American allies. Without mentioning Trump specifically, Merkel said after a NATO summit \\"The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over,\\" This came after Trump had said \\"The Germans are bad, very bad\\" and \\"See the millions of cars they are selling to the U.S. Terrible. We will stop this.\\"  Perceptions and values in the two countries  The exploits of gunslingers on the American frontier played a major role in American folklore, fiction and film. The same stories became immensely popular in Germany, which produced its own novels and films about the American frontier. Karl May (1842–1912) was a German writer best known for his adventure novels set in the American Old West. His main protagonists are Winnetou and Old Shatterhand.Tassilo Schneider, \\"Finding a new Heimat in the Wild West: Karl May and the German Western of the 1960s.\\" Journal of Film and Video (1995): 50–66. in JSTORChristopher Frayling, Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone (2006) The German fascination with Native Americans dates to the early 19th century, with a volumous literature. Typical writings focus on \\"Indianness\\" and authenticity.H. Glenn Penny, \\"Elusive authenticity: The quest for the authentic Indian in German public culture.\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 48#4 (2006): 798–819. online Germany and the US are civil societies. Germany's philosophical heritage and American spirit for \\"freedom\\" interlock to a central aspect of Western culture and Western civilization. Even though developed under different geographical settings, the Age of Enlightenment is fundamental to the self-esteem and understanding of both nations. The American-led invasion of Iraq changed the perception of the US in Germany significantly. A 2013 BBC World Service poll shows found that 35% find American influence to be positive while 39% view it to be negative. Both countries differ in many key areas, such as energy and military intervention. A survey conducted on behalf of the German embassy in 2007 showed that Americans continued to regard Germany's failure to support the war in Iraq as the main irritant in relations between the two nations. The issue was of declining importance, however, and Americans still considered Germany to be their fourth most important international partner behind the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. Americans considered economic cooperation to be the most positive aspect of US-German relations with a much smaller role played by Germany in U.S. politics. Among the nations of Western Europe, German public perception of the US is unusual in that it has continually fluctuated back and forth from fairly positive in 2002 (60%), to considerably negative in 2007 (30%), back to mildly positive in 2012 (52%), and back to considerably negative in 2017 (35%) reflecting the sharply polarized and mixed feelings of the German people for the United States. = Anti-Americanism = In the postwar era 1945-1970, Americanization was part of the process of becoming a Western European, and anti-Americanism was weak. However in the late 1960s, West Germany's youth contrasted the images of Woodstock --which they likedand Vietnam--which they hated. Young rebels turned to violence to destroy the foundations of a society that backed American cultural imperialism. Anti-Americanism reappeared among intellectuals after the attacks on 11 September 2001 because some of them linked globalization, Americanization, and terrorism.Gerrit-Jan Berendse, \\"German anti-Americanism in context.\\" Journal of European Studies 33.3-4 (2003): 333-350. The War in Iraq in 2003 was highly unpopular at all levels of German society.Tuomas Forsberg, \\"German foreign policy and the war on Iraq: Anti-Americanism, pacifism or emancipation?.\\" Security Dialogue 36.2 (2005): 213-231. During the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the official government policy in East Germany, and pro-American dissenters were punished. In West Germany, anti- Americanism was the common position on the left, but the majority praised the United States as a protector against communism and a critical ally in rebuilding the nation.Dan Diner, America in the eyes of the Germans: an essay on anti-Americanism (1996). After 1990, the Communist Party in the East struggled under a new name, \\"Die Linke\\", and maintained their old anti- American position. Today, it warns that America is plotting to spoil Germany's friendly relationship with Russia. Germany's refusal to support the American- led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was often seen as a manifestation of anti- Americanism.Tuomas Forsberg, \\"German foreign policy and the war on Iraq: anti- Americanism, pacifism or emancipation?.\\" Security Dialogue (2005) 36#2 pp: 213–231. online Anti-Americanism had been muted on the right since 1945, but reemerged in the 21st century especially in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that began in opposition to European Union, and now has become both anti-American and anti-immigrant. Annoyance or distrust of the Americans was heightened in 2013 by revelations of American spying on top German officials, including Chancellor Angela Merkel.\\"Ami go Home,\\" Economist Feb. 7, 2015, p 51  Military relations  Statue of General von Steuben at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania Defence ministers James Mattis (U.S.) and Ursula von der Leyen (Germany) meeting in Washington, DC = History = German-American military relations began in the Revolution when German troops fought on both sides. Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, a former Captain in the Prussian Army, was appointed Inspector General of the Continental Army and played the major role in training American soldiers to the best European standards. Von Steuben is considered to be one of the founding fathers of the United States Army. Another German that served during the American Revolution was Major General Johann de Kalb, who served under Horatio Gates at the Battle of Camden and died as a result of several wounds he sustained during the fighting. About 30,000 German mercenaries fought for the British, with 17,000 hired from Hesse, about one in four of the adult male population of the principality. The Hessians fought under their own officers under British command. Leopold Philip de Heister, Wilhelm von Knyphausen, and Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Lossberg were the principal generals who commanded these troops with Frederick Christian Arnold, Freiherr von Jungkenn as the senior German officer. German Americans have been very influential in the American military. Some notable figures include Brigadier General August Kautz, Major General Franz Sigel, General of the Armies John J. Pershing, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, and General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.. = Today = The United States established a permanent military presence in Germany during the Second World War that continued throughout the Cold War, with a peak level of over 274,000 U.S. troops stationed in Germany in 1962, and was drawn down in the early 21st century. The last American tanks were withdrawn from Germany in 2013, but they returned the following year to address a gap in multinational training opportunities. The U.S. had 35,000 American troops in Germany in 2017. Germany and the United States are joint NATO members. Both nations have cooperated closely in the War on Terror, for which Germany provided more troops than any other nation. Germany hosts the headquarters of the US Africa Command and the Ramstein Air Base, a U.S. Air Force base. The two nations had opposing public policy positions in the War in Iraq; Germany blocked US efforts to secure UN resolutions in the buildup to war, but Germany quietly supported some US interests in southwest Asia. German soldiers operated military biological and chemical cleanup equipment at Camp Doha in Kuwait; German Navy ships secured sea lanes to deter attacks by Al Qaeda on U.S. Forces and equipment in the Persian Gulf; and soldiers from Germany's Bundeswehr deployed all across southern Germany to US military bases to conduct force protection duties in place of German-based U.S. Soldiers who were deployed to the Iraq War. The latter mission lasted from 2002 until 2006, by which time nearly all these Bundeswehr were demobilized.Gordon, Michael and Trainor, Bernard \\"Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq\\" New York: 2006 U.S. soldiers wounded in Iraq received medical treatment at Germany's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. In March 2019, Trump was reportedly drafting a demand several countries, including Germany, to pay the United States 150% of the cost of the American troops deployed on their soil. The proposed demand was criticized by experts. Douglas Lute, a retired general and former US ambassador to NATO, said that Trump was using \\"a misinformed narrative that these facilities are there for the benefits of those countries. The truth is they're there and we maintain them because they're in our interest.\\" In a sharp deterioration of relations, in summer 2020, Washington announced plans to significantly cut the number of US military personnel stationed in Germany, from 34,500 to 25,000. https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/06/05/trump-orders- massive-cut-to-us-troop-numbers-in-germany-report/ Members of the German government criticized the move, calling it \\"unacceptable\\" and stating that current US-German relations are \\"complicated.\\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-germany-military-beyer- idUSKBN23F0MA President Trump told reporters that US troops: :are there to protect Germany, right? And Germany is supposed to pay for it....Germany’s not paying for it. We don’t want to be the suckers any more. The United States has been taken advantage of for 25 years, both on trade and on the military. So we’re reducing the force because they’re not paying their bills.Julian Borger, \\"US to pull 12,000 troops out of Germany as Trump blasts 'delinquent' Berlin\\" The Guardian 29 July 2020 As of August 2020, the plan was to move 11,900 troops out of Germany and reassign them elsewhere in Europe, either immediately or after first returning them to the United States for a while. The movement is estimated to cost billions of dollars.  Economic relations  U.S. trade deficit (in billions, goods only) by country in 2014 Economic relations between Germany and the United States are average. The Transatlantic Economic Partnership between the US and the EU, which was launched in 2007 on Germany's initiative, and the subsequently created Transatlantic Economic Council open up additional opportunities. The US is Germany's principal trading partner outside the EU and Germany is the US's most important trading partner in Europe. In terms of the total volume of U.S. bilateral trade (imports and exports), Germany remains in fifth place, behind Canada, China, Mexico, and Japan. The US ranks fourth among Germany's trading partners, after the Netherlands, China and France. At the end of 2013, bilateral trade was worth $162 billion.Vittorio Valli, The American Economy from Roosevelt to Trump (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), passim. Germany and the US are important to each other as investment destinations. At the end of 2012, bilateral investment was worth $320 billion, German direct investment in the US amounting to $199 billion and U.S. direct investment in Germany $121 billion. At the end of 2012, US direct investment in Germany stood at approximately $121 billion, an increase of nearly 14% over the previous year (approximately $106 billion). During the same period, German direct investment in the US amounted to some $199 billion, below the previous year's level (approximately $215 billion). Germany is the eighth largest foreign investor in the US, after the United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, France, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, and ranks eleventh as a destination for US foreign direct investment. In 2019 the United States SenateSen. Cruz: ‘The Administration Needs to Immediately Begin Implementing These Sanctions’ on Nord Stream 2 Pipe-Laying Vessels, December 12, 2019, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz announced intention of passing controversial legislation which threatened to place sanctions on German or European Union companies which work to complete a petrol-chemical pipeline between Germany and Russia. The move was seen as an attempt to extend U.S. dominance over the German government. The United States then offered a competing pipeline which it was expected that Germany should elect alternatively on U.S. terms.  Cultural relations  Karl May was a prolific German writer who specialized in writing Westerns. Although he visited America only once towards the end of his life, May provided Germany with a series of frontier novels, which provided Germans with an imaginary view of America. Notable German-American architects, artist, musicians and writers include: * Josef Albers, artist and educator * Albert Bierstadt, known for his lavish, sweeping landscapes of the American West * Philip K. Dick, writer * Walter Gropius, architect * Albert Kahn, architect * Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, architect * Paul Hindemith, composer * Philip Johnson, architect * Otto Klemperer, conductor * Henry Miller, writer * Les Paul, guitarist * Carl Schurz, politician and writer * Dr. Seuss, writer and illustrator * Alfred Stieglitz, photographer * Kurt Vonnegut, writer German takes third place after Spanish and French among the foreign languages taught at American secondary schools, colleges and universities. Conversely, nearly half of the German population can speak English well. A German-American Friendship Garden was built in Washington, DC, and stands as a symbol of the positive and co- operative relations between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. It is on the historic axis between the White House and the Washington Monument on the National Mall, the garden borders Constitution Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets, where an estimated seven million visitors pass each year. The garden features plants native to both Germany and the United States and provides seating and cooling fountains. Commissioned to commemorate the 300th anniversary of German immigration to America, the garden was dedicated on November 15, 1988.  Research and academia  surrendered to the Americans just before this May 3, 1945 photo. Following the Nazi rise to power in 1933, and in particular the passing of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed opponents and persons with one Jewish grandparent from government positions (including academia), hundreds of physicists and other academics fled Germany and many came to the United States. James Franck and Albert Einstein were among the more notable scientists who ended up in the United States. Many of the physicists who fled were subsequently instrumental in the wartime Manhattan Project to develop the nuclear bomb. Following the World War II, some of these academics returned to Germany but many remained in the United States.The scientific exodus from Nazi Germany, Physics Today, 26 September 2018The Forgotten Women Scientists Who Fled the Holocaust for the United States, Lorraine Boissoneault, Smithsonianmag, 9 November 2017 After WWII and during the Cold War, Operation Paperclip was a secret United States Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) program in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians (many of whom were formerly registered members of the Nazi Party and some of whom had leadership roles in the Nazi Party), including Wernher von Braun's rocket team, were recruited and brought to the United States for government employment from post-Nazi Germany. Wernher von Braun, who built the German V-2 rockets, and his team of scientists came to the United States and were central in building the American space exploration program. Researchers at German and American universities run various exchange programs and projects, and focus on space exploration, the International Space Station, environmental technology, and medical science. Import cooperations are also in the fields of biochemistry, engineering, information and communication technologies and life sciences (networks through: Bacatec, DAAD). The United States and Germany signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation in February 2010.  American cultural institutions in Germany  In the postwar era, a number of institutions, devoted to highlighting American culture and society in Germany, were established and are in existence today, especially in the south of Germany, the area of the former U.S. Occupied Zone. Today, they offer English courses as well as cultural programs.  Diplomatic missions  * Embassy of the United States, Berlin * Embassy of Germany, Washington, D.C.

The series - hosted by Joe Garagiola - ran from February 15 to July 30, 1971. The show's creator and packager was Merv Griffin, and its announcer was Johnny Olson (his only announcing job for Merv Griffin Productions). Gameplay Five contestants, all women and one of them a returning champion (or designate), compete and are spotted $50 at the start of the game. Before each round, they are each given a booklet containing the questions and answers to be used in that round. The time they have to study the material varies per round. Once the study time period has elapsed, the show's assistants collect the booklets and Garagiola begins asking questions at random from the booklet. The champion - who is seated in the number 1 position - can elect to answer or call out an opponent's number (2 through 5). That player can answer or call any of her opponents to answer, and so on until a \\"time's up\\" buzzer sounds. At that time, the active player at that moment has to answer. A correct answer is worth $5, a wrong answer loses that amount. Play continues in this fashion until all the questions are exhausted. Subsequent rounds are played with increased stakes ($10 in Round 2, $20 in Round 3 and all future rounds). The winner at the end of the show wins a $1,000 bonus and returns the next day to meet new challengers. If a contestant stays on for three days, she retires undefeated and wins a new car. Broadcast history Memory Game was one of eight shows NBC attempted to program in the 1:30 PM (12:30 Central) time slot between 1968 and 1975; like most of the others, CBS' As the World Turns and ABC's Let's Make a Deal (formerly seen on NBC) soundly defeated it in the ratings. Three weeks after this show's cancellation, NBC moved Garagiola to another daytime game, Sale of the Century, which he hosted for the rest of its original run. Three on a Match, hosted by Bill Cullen, replaced Memory Game on the NBC schedule. Production According to The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television by Wesley Hyatt, Griffin did not identify his production company on the end credits of the program. The talk-show host and entertainment mogul never gave any explanation for his decision. Episode status Much like other NBC games of the era, most episodes of Memory Game are believed to have been wiped as per network practices. Five episodes are known to exist at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.UCLA Archive: Memory Game References External links * Memory Game entry at Internet Movie Database.

For 40 years TBT was used as a biocide in anti-fouling paint, commonly known as bottom paint, applied to the hulls of ocean going vessels. Bottom paint improves ship performance and durability as it reduces the rate of biofouling (the growth of organisms on the ship's hull). The TBT slowly leaches out into the marine environment where it is highly toxic toward nontarget organisms. TBT is also an obesogen. After it led to collapse of local populations of organisms, TBT was banned. Chemical properties TBT, or tributyltin, tributylstannyl or tributyl stannic hydride compounds are organotin compounds. They have three butyl groups covalently bonded to a tin(IV) centre.Davies, Alwyn George. (2004) Organotin Chemistry, 2nd Edition Weinheim: Wiley-VCH. A general formula for these compounds is (n-C4H9)3Sn-X. The “X”, typically occurs in three forms, each an electronegative compound bound to a chloride, hydroxide, or a carboxylate. TBT compounds have a low water solubility, a property that is perfect for antifouling agents. The toxicity of TBT prevents the growth of algae, barnacles, molluscs and other organisms on ships hulls. When introduced into a marine or aquatic environment, TBT adheres to bed sediments. TBT has a low Log Kow of 3.19 – 3.84 mg/l in distilled water and 3.54 mg/l for sea water, this makes TBT highly hydrophobic. TBT compounds have a high fat solubility and tend to absorb more readily to organic matter in soils or sediment. The bioaccumulation of TBT in organisms such as molluscs, oysters and dolphins, have extreme effects on their reproductive systems, central nervous systems and endocrine systems. However, the adsorption of TBT to sediments is reversible and depends on pH. Although an effective biocide, tributyltin was wrongly deemed safe environmentally. TBT has a half-life of one or two weeks in marine water. When it accumulates in sediments its half life is about 2 years. TBT often bonds to suspended material and sediments, where it can remain and be released for up to 30 years. Studies have shown that 95% of TBT can be released from the sediments back into the aquatic environment. This absorption process can complicate quantification of TBT in an environment, since its concentration in the water is not representative of its availability. Uses Tributyltin compounds are biocides. TBT's antifouling properties were discovered in the 1950s in the Netherlands by van der Kerk and coworkers. It prevents microorganisms from settling on the hull of a ship and poisons the organisms that do. By the mid 1960s it had become the most popular anti-fouling paint around the globe. TBT was mixed into paints to extend the life of antifouling coatings, and ships were able to continue operations for a longer time frame. The paints ensured fuel efficiency and delayed costly ship repairs. It is also relatively inexpensive. TBT is also an ingredient in some disinfectants, for example in combination with quaternary ammonium compounds.Steritech Concentrated Antimicrobial Solution brochure , accessed 02 December 2014 Toxicity The effects of antifouling paint go beyond the organisms that it is intended to kill. By poisoning barnacles, algae, and other organisms at the bottom of the food chain, the bioaccumulation of TBT increases over time affecting more and more of the bottom feeders of the aquatic food web environment, which are mainly invertebrates and are effected from TBT. There is a slight biomagnification of TPT that has been demonstrated in the lower part of the marine food chain (i.e., planktonic organisms, invertebrates, and fishes). However the biomagnification of TBT into larger marine animals such as marine mammals is debatable Toxic effects in some species occur at 1 nano-gram per liter of water. =Bioaccumulation and biomagnification= As TBT is most often used as a biofouling agent, it bioaccumulates in marine wildlife such as molluscs, with levels being higher in organisms and sediments in and around areas of high maritime activity, such as ports and harbours. The bioaccumulation increases over time, leading to a biomagnification in organisms higher up the food chain, although the biomagnification is not that considerable in size. As TBT can remain in the environment for up to 30 years due to often bonding to suspended material and sediments, This means that TBT can remain in an ecosystem for a very long time, meaning that bioaccumulation readily occurs in marine environments. This can lead to very high amounts of TBT being accumulated, especially in smaller organisms lower down the food chain, which in turn has various health effects. =Invertebrates= Exposure to organotin compounds causes the development of male accessory sex organs in female prosobranch gastropods. This phenomenon has been termed imposex. TBT has been shown to affect invertebrate development. Marine snails, such as the dog whelk (Nucella lapillus), has often been used as an indicator species. In gastropods, the normal process of accessory sex organ development is retinoid dependent, as has been proven by the effect 9cisRA has on male penises. TBTs mimic the endogenous ligand of Retinoid X Receptor (9cisRA), and thus activates the signalling cascades that are retinoid acid dependent, promoting female penis growth. There have been many theories as to why molluscs are affected by TBT. For example, previous literature has stated that TBT would cause the inhibition of aromatase which would lead to an increase in testosterone and therefore, causing imposex. It was theorised that TBT disrupts endocrine system by inhibiting cytochrome P450 molecule. Among its myriad functions, P450 converts androgen, which has male-hormone properties, into oestrogen, which has female hormone properties. It was theorised that the high concentration of androgen lead to the masculinization of females. Another indicator species is Chironomus riparius, a species of non-biting midge, which has been used to test the effects of TBT on development and reproduction at sublethal concentrations found in marine environments. It was found that only 0.05 ng/ml range is enough to have developmental effects on their larvae, and 10-100 ng/l was enough to seriously offset the female to male ratio in the population. At 10 ng/l females were at 55.6% of the population and 85.7% at 100 ng/l. These results are interesting because unlike the masculinization of the stengoglassan gastropods, this experiment shows feminization. =Vertebrates= Vertebrates become affected by the waters contaminated with TBT as well as by consuming organisms that have already been poisoned. Oryzias latipes, commonly called Japanese rice fish, has been used as a model vertebrate organism to test for effects of TBT at developmental stages of the embryo. It was observed that developmental rate was slowed by TBT in a concentration-related manner and that tail abnormalities occurred. Illustrating the infiltration of TBT in the food chain, one study showed that most samples of skipjack tuna tested positive for presence of TBT. Tuna from waters around developing Asian nations had particularly high levels of TBT. Regulation of TBT is not enforced in Asia as rigorously as in Europe or US. Studies have shown that TBT is detrimental to the immune system. Research shows that TBT reduces resistance to infection in fish which live on the seabed and are exposed to high levels of TBT. These areas tend to have silty sediment like harbours and estuaries. TBT compounds have been described to interfere with glucocorticoid metabolism in the liver, by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type 2, which converts cortisol to cortisone. Mammals TBT can enter the diet of humans and other mammals. As of 2008 high levels of tributyltin had been detected in the livers of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and stranded bottlenose dolphins. Otters dying of infectious causes tended to have higher levels of tissue butyltins than those dying of trauma or other causes. TBT has been shown to lead to immunosuppression in sea-otters and dolphins. TBT has also been linked to hearing loss in mammalian top predators such as toothed whales. Regulation Bans on TBT on boats less than 25 metres long first started in the 1980s. In 1990, the Marine Environment Protection Committee adopted Resolution MEPC 46(30), which recommended that the Government eliminate the use of TBT-containing antifouling paints on smaller vessels. This resolution was intended to be a temporary restriction until the International Maritime Organization could implement a ban of TBT anti-fouling agents for ships. Several countries followed, and in 1997 Japan banned the production of TBT- based anti-fouling paints. In 2008 organotin compounds acting as biocide like TBT compounds were banned in anti-fouling paint and included in the Rotterdam Convention and have been banned by the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships of the International Maritime Organization. It states that ships cannot bear organotin compounds on their hulls or external parts or surfaces, unless there is a coating that forms a barrier so that organotin compounds cannot leach out to reduce exposure by allowing recovery to occur. =Violations of the ban on TBT= Even though banned by some international agencies, TBT anti-fouling paints are still used in countries with poor regulation enforcement, as in the Caribbean. =US violations= In November 2018, the US Department of Justice announced that three people they had charged and arrested in New Jersey for manufacturing and selling tributyltin based marine paint had pleaded guilty. Sentencing is scheduled for February 2019.

The concept's key element is the use of steam as a moderator, making it a type of reduced moderation water reactor. Because the density of steam may be controlled very precisely, Filippone claims it can be used to fine-tune neutron fluxes to ensure that neutrons are moving with an optimal energy profile to split nuclei – in other words, cause fission. The CAESAR reactor design exploits the fact that the fission products and daughter isotopes produced via nuclear reactions also decay to produce additional delayed neutrons. Filippone claims that unlike conventional water-cooled fission reactors, where fission occurring in enriched fuel rods moderated by liquid-water coolant ultimately creates a Maxwellian thermal neutron flux profile, the neutron energy profile from delayed neutrons varies widely. In a conventional reactor, he theorizes, the moderator slows these neutrons down so that they cannot contribute to the reaction; has a comparatively large cross- section for neutrons at high energies. Filippone maintains that when steam is used as the moderator, the average neutron energy is increased from that of a liquid water-moderated reactor such that the delayed neutrons persist until they hit another nucleus. The resulting extremely high neutron economy, he claims, will make it possible to maintain a self-sustaining reaction in fuel rods of pure , once the reactor has been started by enriched fuel. Skeptics , however point out that it is generally believed that a controlled, sustained chain reaction is not possible with . It can undergo fission when impacted by an energetic neutron with over 1 MeV of kinetic energy. But the high-energy neutrons produced by fission (after quickly losing energy by inelastic scattering), are not, themselves, sufficient to induce enough successive fissions in to create a critical system (one in which the number of neutrons created by fission is equal to the number absorbed). Instead, bombarding with neutrons below the 1 MeV fission threshold causes it to absorb them without fissioning (becoming ) and decay by beta emission to (which is itself fissile). The energy of delayed neutrons is so low that contribution to fission is almost 0.0000, requiring some fissile material to keep the reactor safely under prompt criticality: (e.g. in natural uranium and preferably also some moderator, possibly outside the extra-fast core).

A former labor activist, he began his career in politics when he participated in the foundation of the People’s Party in 1990. He was elected to the 15th National Assembly at Sosa-gu, Bucheon, as a candidate for the New Korea Party. After continuing to serve as a member of the assembly in the 16th and the 17th National Assemblies, he became the 4th Governor of Gyeonggi Province to be elected by popular vote in 2006. Early life and education Born in 1951, Kim is the third son in his family, and has three brothers and three sisters. After graduating from Yeongcheon Elementary School in Gyeongsangbuk-do, he moved to Daegu Metropolitan City without his family, where he attended Gyeongbuk Middle School and Gyeongbuk High School. In 1970, Kim Moon-Soo entered the Department of Business Administration, in the College of Business at Seoul National University, but was expelled in 1971 allegedly for participating in the October 15 nationwide student protests. In 1974, he was expelled from university again due to his involvement in the National Democratic Youth and Students Union case. He reentered the Department of Business Administration at Seoul National University in 1994, and two years later graduated from university, 25 years after his initial acceptance in 1970. Career =Labor movement= In 1974, he served as the assistant cloth cutter at a fabric plant in Cheonggyecheon, acquiring national engineer’s licenses for environmental management and safety management in 1977. He was elected as the Dorco Labor Union Leader of the Federation of Korean Metal Workers Trade Unions in 1978. He was arrested and tortured by the dictatorial government in 1980, but his indictment was suspended so that he could serve for Dorco again. Kim served as the secretary of the Jun Tae-Il Memorial Society in 1985, and was arrested again for participating in the Incheon May 3 Protest for Constitutional Amendment for Direct Election System in 1986 when he served as the a member of the direction committee for Seoul Confederation of Labor Movement. He was tortured and was imprisoned for two and a half years. =Politics= In 1990, Kim Moon-Soo participated in the foundation of the Popular Party, and served as chair of the Labor Relations Committee. That same year, he ran in 1992 election as candidate No. 3, but was defeated. After joining the Democratic Liberal Party in 1994, he ran for the 15th general election as a candidate for New Korea Party in 1996, and was elected. (Sosa-gu, Bucheon) Following his election, Kim Moon-Soo served as a member of the legislature, focusing on labor and environmental issues, as well as on transportation in the Seoul metropolitan area and childcare. Re-elected to the 16th and the 17th National Assemblies, Kim served for three consecutive terms as a member of the National Assembly. He served as the deputy floor leader for the Grand National Party. After retiring from the National Assembly in 2006 to run for local government, Kim was elected Governor of Gyeonggi Province, taking office as the 4th Governor elected by public vote in July 2006. In April 2012, Kim Moon-Soo declared his presidential candidacy in the primary election of the Saenuri Party.Lee Tae-hoon, \\"Governor Declares Presidential Bid,\\" Korea Times, April 22, 2012.

Life and career Foose Design's logo The 2006 Hemi(s)fear at the Marconi Automotive Museum The custom 1960 Ford Starliner at the Marconi Automotive Museum, customized by Chip Foose. Foose began working on automobiles at age seven for his father's company, Project Design, in Santa Barbara, California. Encouraged by Ford and Preston Tucker designer Alex Tremulis, Foose started to attend the Art Center College of Design in 1982; however, he dropped out after two years due to financial difficulties. After working for four years at Clenet Coachworks, Foose returned to the Art Center to complete his education. After graduating in 1990, Foose worked full-time for Sterenberger Design and part-time for Boyd Coddington. In 1993, Foose resigned from Sterenberger to work for J Mays at Ford; however, Coddington was able to convince Foose to work for him, instead. Working for Coddington full-time, Foose eventually became the president of Coddington's company, Hot Rods by Boyd. While working for Coddington, Foose designed many of Coddington's well known creations such as Boydster and Boydster II. In 1998, with Hot Rods by Boyd facing bankruptcy (due to the failure of Boyds WheelsGeisert, Eric. \\"Ron Whiteside's Ridler Winner\\", in Street Rodder, July 2003, p.80.), Foose left his position and with his wife Lynne started his own automotive and product design company. He first set up in Orange, California, where, as his first project car, he rebuilt Boydster II for Chuck Svatos as the 0032 roadster, which went on to win the America's Most Beautiful Roadster (AMBR) trophy. By 2000, he had established Foose Design in Huntington Beach, California. Foose's departure from Boyd's was not amicable; in a 2006 interview, Foose stated, \\"Boyd has chosen to not have any relations with me, since I stopped working at his shop.\\" One of the main reasons for the bitter relationship is claimed to be Foose retained many of the talented builders formerly employed by Coddington; Mike and Charley left Coddington's business shortly after Foose had established his shop. Foose gained more exposure in 2003 as a result of a TLC documentary on his design and creation of a modified 2002 Ford Thunderbird called Speedbird, and due to his work building Ron Whiteside's 2003 Ridler-winning '34 3-window.Geisert, Eric. \\"Ron Whiteside's Ridler Winner\\", in Street Rodder, July 2003, pp.79-80. In 2004, the TLC program Overhaulin' debuted, with Foose as the star. At the 2005 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show, a unique 1969 Foose- designed Camaro convertible was displayed, to be produced in a 300 car run by Unique Performance of Dallas Texas. Press releases announced UP would also be handling the marketing of Foose's other custom car lines, including Hemisfear, along with Foose's 2006 Mustang Stallion. Foose also designed a paint scheme for 4-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion Jeff Gordon to promote DuPont's Hot Hues paint line. Foose has since severed ties with DuPont and now promotes the BASF Glasurit paint line exclusively. In November 2007, Foose officially severed ties to Unique Performance following police action against UP for alleged illegal activities. In 2006, Foose launched a line of die cast replicas of many of his famous designs partnering with the makers of Johnny Lightning in the creation of JL Full Throttle. This company produced copies of many of Foose's famous, award-winning designs, including Grand Master and Impression. In 2002, Foose won the coveted Ridler Award at the 50th Anniversary Show of the Detroit Autorama with Bob and Wes Rydell's 35 Chevy Master, otherwise known as the \\"Grandmaster\\". Impression subsequently won the prestigious Ridler prize. Also replicated were a number of cars from \\"Overhaulin'\\". Announced at the SEMA show in 2006 was a pact between Foose and Ford to produce Foose designed Ford vehicles, the first of which was shown at the 2007 New York Auto Show. In 2007, Foose began limited production (50 vehicles in total) of Hemisfear. Also known as the Foose Coupe, Hemisfear was designed by Foose in 1990, during his time at the Art Center, and publicly unveiled at the SEMA trade show in November 2006. An earlier design drawing of Hemisfear inspired the Plymouth Prowler. The 2007 Hemisfear was commissioned by a new die cast model car company JL Full Throttle which had partnered with Foose to build both the scale and 1:1 Hemisfear. A Foose coupe was sold along with a design consultation with Foose at the Barrett-Jackson car auction in Palm Beach, Florida at the end of March 2007. The first Foose Coupe Supercar was auctioned for $340,000; sold to Atlanta vintage car dealer and avid car collector Roger Burgess. Foose was retained as design consultant to provide architects with unique styling elements for the exterior and interior of the $275 million expansion of Detroit's MotorCity Casino, anticipated to be complete by the end of 2007.http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi- bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY;=/www/story/08-18-2006/0004418671&EDATE;= Foose helped to start the Ridemakerz customizable toy cars business in 2007. As of 2010, Foose continues to operate Foose Design and provide design consultations to the Big Three automakers. Overhaulin' was canceled at the end of 2009, though reruns still air on Discovery Turbo. Shortly following the launch of the channel Velocity, it was announced that the show would return in the fourth quarter of 2012. Charity work Foose serves as the vice chairman of the Progeria Research Foundation's California Chapter. His youngest sister died of Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome. He has also taken part in numerous children's charities such as Childhelp and Victory Junction Gang Camp.http://www.dirtnewz.com/dr-pressreleases/2009/05-2009/foose-5-22-09.shtml He was named grand marshal of SEMA's Show N' Shine public car show for children's charities.

Early life Wolcott's parents were Samuel Wolcott, D.D. and Harriet Amanda (Pope) Wolcott. Wolcott was one of eleven children, including Anna Wolcott Vaile. A native of Hampden County, Massachusetts, Wolcott moved to Ohio as a boy.  Career  =Military service= He served in the 150th Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He enlisted at age 16. =Legal and political career= In 1875, he graduated from Harvard Law School and moved to Colorado where he set up a law practice. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, one of the partners in his practice was Charles W. Waterman, later a United States Senator. In 1879, Wolcott moved to Denver, where he began his political career as a Colorado state senator (1879–1882). In 1889, he was chosen to represent Colorado in the U.S. Senate, as a member of the Republican Party. He was reelected in 1895, and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1901, 1902 and 1903. While in Washington, D.C., Wolcott was a leading advocate for the coinage of silver. In 1897, President McKinley named him chairman of the commission sent to Europe to report on international bimetallism. He was a popular host and guest in Washington society. He was chairman of the Committee on Civil Service (51st and 52nd Congresses), and Retrenchment Committee on Post Office and Post Roads (54th through 56th Congresses).

The election was between James J. Faran, the Democratic contender and editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer, and James D. Taylor, rabid nativist editor of the Cincinnati Times. Rumors of illegal voting, ballot-box stuffing, and naturalized voters preventing native-born citizens from voting sparked the events. =Louisville Riot= =Baltimore Riot= See Know-Nothing Riots of 1856 =Washington D.C. Riot= On June 1, 1857, a band of American Party rowdies traveled by train from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. to assist local party members in controlling the polls at a municipal election. The band included members of the Plug Uglies and Rip Raps. After word of their arrival spread and rioting began at several polls, President James Buchanan called out United States Marines from the Navy Yard to quell the fighting. At one of the polls, the Marines clashed with citizens, most of them Washingtonians. They opened fire, killing ten men, only one from Baltimore. The violence drew sharp condemnation of Buchanan's resort to military force, but resulted in no significant criminal prosecutions. = New York Riot (Dead Rabbits riot) = =New Orleans Riot= The New Orleans Know- Nothing group began as a local movement in 1858 to reduce what residents considered a high rate of crime and violence in the city, primarily among Irish and German immigrants, who were among the poorest classes. A secret Vigilance Committee was formed to monitor their activities, and in particular to prevent disruption of upcoming municipal elections. On the night of June 2, 1858, armed men under the command of Capt. J.K. Duncan, an officer in the United States Army, marched to Jackson Square and occupied the court rooms in The Cabildo. For the next five days, a standoff existed between the Vigilance Committee and members of the Native American Party. On June 7, the elections were held and the Native American candidate, Gerard Stith, defeated the Democratic Party candidate, P.G.T. Beauregard.

Previously known as the St. Elizabeth Medical Center, the hospital was renamed in 2009 during the construction of St. Elizabeth East. In the 1980’s it was known as St. Elizabeth Hospital. It is home to the St. Elizabeth School of Nursing, the only hospital-based nursing school in the state of Indiana. History The hospital at 14th and Tippecanoe Streets. St. Elizabeth Central opened when six members of the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration left their home in Germany in 1875 in order to care for the sick in Lafayette, Indiana. The hospital opened in 1876 and launched the St. Elizabeth School of Nursing in 1897. In 1998, operation of Home Hospital and St. Elizabeth Hospital merged under an equal partnership known as Greater Lafayette Health Services (GLHS). Each hospital retained its long-established identity and traditions. In 2003, the Sisters of St. Francis Health Services, Inc., founders and continuous owners of St. Elizabeth Hospital, became the sole owners of the non-profit corporation, its two hospitals and related patient care facilities. GLHS was the corporate name used since 2003, but in 2007 GLHS was officially changed to St. Elizabeth Regional Health, and later to its new name, Franciscan St. Elizabeth Health. Greater Lafayette Health Services announced in late 2005 a plan to close Home Hospital, and construct a new facility to replace them on the city's southeast side, with St. Elizabeth Medical Center remaining open for critical patient care. Work on the new facility commenced in late 2006, with occupation planned to occur in December 2009. In June 2009, the hospital was renamed St. Elizabeth Central (formally Franciscan St. Elizabeth Health - Lafayette Central) as part of the expanded reuse plan for the facility. The St. Elizabeth Central name allows the community - including hospital employees, volunteers, physicians and physician office staff members - an opportunity to better identify each hospital campus location. As part of St. Elizabeth Regional Health's ongoing maintenance and continuous improvement of its medical facilities, St. Elizabeth Central has made $11 million worth of enhancements from 2004 to 2009. In total, almost $5 million has been spent on maintenance and repair to existing buildings on the St. Elizabeth Central campus, and more than $6 million for renovations and upgrades to St. Elizabeth Central including: * Pharmacy, * Physical therapy and outpatient therapy facilities, * Seton Specialty Hospital renovations, * Hospice relocation within the Bill Long Building, * Chapel renovations, and * Relocations, upgrades, demolitions, replacement of carpet and furnishings and remodels. In September 2016, Franciscan Alliance adopted the new name Franciscan Health and renamed the hospital to Franciscan Health Lafayette Central. Chapel The Roman Catholic chapel at St. Elizabeth's has Eucharistic Adoration, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Masses are held Monday through Friday at 7:00 AM, and at 9:00 AM on Saturdays, Sundays and Holy Days.

However, they interrupted by a call from Anna's father who says that Susan is going to back to rehab and wants to say goodbye. Anna considers their farewell to be intimate and is surprised when Ben tags along though she does not voice her displeasure. After Susan boards the plane to her next rehab, Anna must face the consequences of the Steinberg party. Margaret informs Anna that her behavior (abandoning a client in favor of rushing a drunk Susan home) was unacceptable and is about to fire her when Clark Sheppard intervenes. He takes Anna as his intern and gives her the assignment of covering the latest hit TV show Hermosa Beach. Anna meets the young but charming co-executive producer Danny Bluestone who actually dreams of writing the Great American Novel and is appalled by Ben's increasing jealous attitude towards him and Jonathan Percy's driver, Django, who has always been friendly to her. Anna is also worried that Ben is dropping his studies for her and tries to get him to go back to Princeton. Their relationship must come to another end when Ben agrees he must go back to Princeton to finish school and not worry about his family so much. Meanwhile, Cammie feels increasingly deserted by her friends: Dee is enamored with her new boyfriend, Stevie, while Sam seems to be showing interest in Adam Flood. To further her dismay, her step-mother announces that her daughter, Mia, will be moving in. Cammie initially hates Mia, a secretive fourteen-year-old Valley girl, but takes her out shopping in order to not feel alone. After finding out that Sam is no longer interested in Adam, Cammie kisses him at a party but is surprised at the chemistry between them. She not so subtly follows Adam to a Beck concert and the two are invited to a rave by a rapper, Mo Bad. Cammie and Adam kiss again but are interrupted by Dee who nonchalantly mentions she invited Mia along with her as well. Cammie's protective instincts kick in and the three go find Mia at the party and take her home. Cammie reveals to Adam that even though she doesn't like Mia, Mia reminds her a lot of how she acted after her mom died. Cammie also mentions that she wished she had a big sister to keep her from making stupid choices which is what she is going to try to do for Mia. However, the next day, Cammie becomes frustrated at Mia's self- destructive attitude and decides she can't be Mia's rescuer. Meanwhile, Adam tells Cammie that they should slow down their relationship because he still has feelings for Anna. Enraged, Cammie plots to sabotage Anna, who is somewhat enjoying her internship, despite the unfamiliar terms and erratic actors. Soon, it all comes crashing down when Clark accused Anna of leaking sensitive information to the press. He fires her and forbids anyone from work associating with her. Anna tries to explain to Danny her side of the story but he sadly tells her that he can't been seen with her or else his career will go down the drain. Sam makes Anna realize the true culprit and the two plot a plan for justice. In the meantime, Cammie organizes and throws her sweet 18th birthday party on her own (since Sam and Dee have been too busy to help) and is horrified when her credit and debit cards are denied by the party planner. Even worse, her BMW is towed and when she returns home, Clark reveals that he knows Cammie was the true culprit behind the leaked information and is going to be punished for so, thanks to Mia who collaborated with Sam and Anna to clear Anna's name. In the morning, Adam shows up to comfort Cammie and the two go on a quiet date to the park while Clark half-heartedly apologizes to Anna for the mistake and offers her job back. Anna politely declines and then surprises Danny at the office.

The taller ones can be used at the front of a dry sunny border. They have reasonable frost resistance, but resent dampness in winter. Propagate from seed or summer cuttings of perennial species, or by division of clumps. Monardella is a nectar plant for many Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), including the endangered Myrtle's silverspot (Speyeria zerene myrtleae).

Early life  Born in Fayette, Missouri, he attended the common schools and graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1875. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1876 and began practice in Fayette. He moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1879 and continued the practice of law. Beginning in 1889, one of the attorneys he practiced in partnership with for several years was Charles W. Waterman, later a US Senator. His son, John F. Shafroth Jr., later a vice admiral in the US Navy during World War II, was born on 31 March 1887.  Political career  He was city attorney from 1887 to 1891 and was elected as a Republican to the 54th Congress as a representative. He then joined other Colorado officials, such as Senator Henry M. Teller, in leaving the Republicans to join the Silver Republican Party, the third party on whose ticket he was re-elected to the 55th, 56th, and 57th Congresses. To the 58th Congress, he presented credentials as a Democratic member-elect. Thus, he served in the House from March 4, 1895 to his resignation on February 15, 1904, when he declared that fraud in 29 electoral precincts made him unable to assert that he had legitimately won the election and requested for his opponent, Robert W. Bonynge, to replace him.Very Honest Man Astounds Lower House of Congress, in The Tacoma Times (via Chronicling America); published February 15, 1904; retrieved 2015-01-03. Subsequently, Shafroth was often referred to (sometimes admiringly, sometimes sarcastically) as \\"Honest John.\\" Shafroth was Governor of Colorado from 1909 to 1913 and was instrumental in bringing in Colorado's ballot initiative institutions. In 1912, he was elected as a Democrat to the Senate, where he served one term, from March 4, 1913, to March 3, 1919; he was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1918. While a Senator, Shafroth was chairman of the Committee on Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico (63rd to 65th Congresses); the leading Senate sponsor of the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917, which granted citizenship to Puerto Ricans; and a member of the Committee on the Philippines (65th Congress).  Later life and death  After leaving the Senate, he served as chairman of the War Minerals Relief Commission from 1919 to 1921. He died in 1922 and was interred in Fairmount Cemetery in Denver. His personal and official papers are archived at several locations including the Colorado State Archives (gubernatorial papers), the Colorado Historical Society Library, and the Denver Public Library's Western History and Genealogy Department.

It is also known as La Fugitive (in French) and The Sweet Cheat Gone (in English). Plot In the sixth volume of the series fitting seems that Proust's past actions conclude with a fair resolution. The captive is now the fugitive. Like in previous volumes, envy and distrusts eventually reveals unsuspected and unwanted revelations that lead the Narrator to reconcile himself with his melancholy. But unfortunately happiness still running away for him, and the marriage of his once good friends face him against his own misery which he tries to cover with indifference Publication The final three volumes of the novel were published posthumously and without Proust's final corrections and revisions. The first edition, based on Proust's manuscript, was published as Albertine disparue to prevent it from being confused with Rabindranath Tagore's La Fugitive (1921). The first definitive edition of the novel in French (1954), also based on Proust's manuscript, used the title La Fugitive. The second, even-more-definitive French edition (1987–89) uses the title Albertine disparue and is based on an unmarked typescript acquired in 1962 by the Bibliothèque Nationale. Mante-Proust typescript After the death in 1986 of Proust's niece, Suzy Mante-Proust, her son-in-law discovered among her papers a typescript that had been corrected and annotated by Proust. The late changes Proust made include a small crucial detail and the deletion of approximately 150 pages. This version was published in French (Paris: Grasset, 1987) and translated as Albertine Gone by Terence Kilmartin (London: Chatto & Windus, 1989); the translation is now out of print. Whether Proust's changes to the manuscript can be integrated into the text of modern editions of Lost Time, remains the subject of contentious debate. Current French editions adopt different approaches to the problem. The 1987 French Pléiade edition preserved the deleted material.http://www.fabula.org/revue/cr/412.php However, Jean Milly's 2002 GF Flammarion edition follows Proust's typescript, and restores the sub-title \\"Sodom and Gomorrah III.\\"http://editions.flammarion.com/Albums_Detail.cfm?ID=19756&levelCode;=home This disagreement reflects the dilemma created by the condition of Albertine disparue/La Fugitive. Proust's edited typescript shows his final intentions, but he did not have time to fully realize those intentions. Thus, the typescript leaves Albertine disparue inconsistent with Time Regained. Moreover, Proust's anticipated (but never realized) further volumes of Sodom and Gomorrah might ultimately have included the deleted material. For the 2002 English translation of the volume, editor Christopher Prendergast charged Peter Collier with translating the 1989 edition. Notes External links * Albertine disparue, French text.

The two end up having a conversation about one-night stands. Dan claims Anna isn't the type to have one but Anna claims that she would and that she doesn't think casual sex is bad even though she has only had sex with Ben, who has returned to Princeton. Her relationship with him is not certain between both of them but Anna thinks that them two have broken up or at least, are on a break. Once Anna returns home she finds her mother and father on the couch in her father's house in Los Angeles having a drink. She finds this shocking because since the divorce, her parents couldn't stand to be in the same room. Her father explains that her sister Susan is coming out of rehab and that her doctor suggested that they meet her as a whole family. Sam is also having her own family problems as her new stepmother Poppy has taken over the whole house to prepare for Sam's soon to be sister, Ruby Hummingbird. To Sam's further dismay, Dee has become fast friends with Poppy and even moves in to help with the baby preparations, causing Sam to feel ignored. She joins Anna at Las Casitas, not caring that the whole Sharpe family is supposed to appear on The Tonight Show together. Meanwhile, Cammie and Adam's relationship is growing, but they have not had sex yet which Cammie finds strange. She tries to seduce him on the beach but Adam refuses and Cammie realizes he is a virgin, finding it sweet. Still, she doesn't want people to think she has lost her reputation as a vixen and so Cammie tells everyone she and Adam are having amazing sex, unbeknownst to him. Cammie and Adam do attempt to have sex throughout the course of the book but they are always interrupted. Eventually, she and Adam agree to wait until the time is right. The two take shelter in a seemingly empty mansion as a thunderstorm begins while Kai and Eduardo realize the girls are missing. Eduardo calls Jackson Sharpe, who cancels the Jay Leno appearance to go to Mexico to search for Sam. A search party begins and in the morning, Sam and Anna are discovered by the guards of the owner who owns the place. The two explain their story and are rescued by Jackson and his helicopter. Anna is a little jealous and hurt that her own father didn't come also. Sam is confused when Eduardo acts coldly to her after they return to Las Casitas but shrugs it off as they are now going their separate ways. However, back in Beverly Hills, Sam throws a party with her friends who all eagerly demand to know the details of the rescue and Eduardo shows up to apologize for mistreating Sam and asks her out on another date. Also, Anna's parents once again part separate ways and she is relieved. With her head clear, Anna is finally able to surf properly, much to her delight. 2005 American novels American young adult novels Little, Brown and Company books ","title":"Tall Cool One (novel)"},{"id":"4042755","text":"Interior of the Cathedral, looking towards the High Altar Reredos in St Marys Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh St Mary's Cathedral (Scottish Gaelic: Cathair- eaglais Naomh Moire), or the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary the Virgin is a cathedral of the Scottish Episcopal Church in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was built in the late 19th century in the West End of Edinburgh's New Town. The cathedral is the see of the Bishop of Edinburgh, one of seven bishops within the Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion. Designed in a Gothic style by Sir George Gilbert Scott, the cathedral is now protected as a category A listed building. and part of the Old Town and New Town of Edinburgh World Heritage Site. Reaching , its spire makes the building the highest in the Edinburgh urban area. History In 1689, following the Glorious Revolution, Presbyterianism was restored in place of episcopacy in the national Church of Scotland. St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, as it then was, came under the Established Church's ministry, resulting in Episcopalians being left without a cathedral in Edinburgh. For a time the Episcopal residue of that congregation worshipped in an old woollen mill in Carrubber's Close, near the site of the present Old Saint Paul's Church. This was used as a pro- cathedral until the early 19th century, when this function was served by the Church of St Paul in York Place. =Funding= The grave of Barbara and Mary Walker, Greyfriars Kirkyard The original construction was paid for by Barbara and Mary Walker, spinster sisters, providing funds for this purpose from 1873. The cathedral is built on their garden and the land was also part of the gift. They owned the surrounding Drumsheugh Estate and lived in Easter Coates House, which still survives to the north of the cathedral. They were the granddaughters of Rev. George Walker, the Episcopal Minister of Old Meldrum Church (1734-1781). Their father, William Walker, was Attorney in Exchequer, and Bearer of the White Rod of Scotland. William Street nearby is named after him. Their mother was Mary Drummond, daughter of George Drummond, six times Lord Provost of Edinburgh and initiator of the New Town. Their father, William Walker, bought the Coates estate from the Byres family around 1800 and is remembered in the street names William Street and Walker Street.The Closes and Wynds of the Old Town: Old Edinburgh Club. =Design and construction= The cathedral was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and the foundation stone was laid on 21 May 1874 by the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, whose family had been supportive of Scottish episcopacy over the previous hundred years. Inside the stone was placed a bottle containing a copy of the Trust Deed, the Edinburgh Post Office Directory, Oliver and Boyd's Almanac, newspapers and coins. In preparation for the opening of the Cathedral a congregation had been formed to worship in a temporary iron church erected on the site now occupied by the Song School. Beginning on 26 May 1876, it was ministered to by the dean, James Montgomery, and two chaplains, and grew rapidly. The nave of the cathedral was opened on 25 January 1879 and from that day, daily services have been held in the cathedral. The twin spires at the west end, known as \\"Barbara\\" and \\"Mary\\" after the Walker sisters, were not begun until 1913 and completed in 1917. The architect for these was Charles Marriott Oldrid Scott, Sir George's grandson. The builder was Edwin C. Morgan. The reredos is designed by John Oldrid Scott and sculpted by Mary Grant.Dictionary of British Sculptors The critic Sacheverell Sitwell condemned the design as \\"peerless for ugliness, unless it be for its own sister, Scott's chapel of St John's, at Cambridge\\". Music St Mary's Cathedral is the only cathedral in Scotland to maintain a tradition of daily choral services with choristers drawn from its own choir school. It was the first cathedral in Britain to employ girls in the treble line as well as boys, in 1978 when Dennis Townhill was organist and choir master. In 2005 St Mary's Cathedral became the first cathedral in the Anglican tradition to have a female alto singing in daily services. The Father Henry Willis organ was built in 1879. St Mary's Music School was founded to educate its choirboys. It continues to educate choristers of the cathedral and is now a separate specialist music school open to all pupils. There are ten original bells in the central tower of the Cathedral hung for change ringing, with two further bells which have been added recently. They were the gift of the first Dean of St Mary's, James F. Montgomery. The bells were all cast by John Taylor & Co. of Loughborough to weight ratios defined by Lord Grimthorpe who was a leading bell designer of his day. This is one of only a few complete Grimthorpe rings still in existence. The bells were dedicated on 29 October 1879. The tenor bell weighs 41 cwt.Dove Bellringer's Guide; 6th ed., 1982, p. 181 The cathedral hosts a number of classical concerts during the annual Edinburgh Festival Fringe. = Cathedral organists = T.H.

The aqueduct consists of three arches and is 110 yards long with a central elliptical arch of 60 ft (18.3 m) span with two side arches each semicircular and 34 ft (10.4 m) across, all with V-jointed arch stones. The spandrel and wing walls are built in alternate courses of ashlar masonry, and rock-faced blocks. The central span sagged soon after it was built and has been repaired many times. There is a picturesque weir on the River Avon where permission for a micro hydro electric scheme was applied for from the Environment Agency in 2009, but this is still awaited in 2013. This is a popular starting point for walks along both the canal and the river, and also to Barton Farm Country Park at Bradford-on-Avon.

Todd starts the game with a water pistol and computer generated map. Players in Slime World are armed with a water cannon that can be fired at many angles and can kill most enemies in one hit, cling to and climb most walls, and perform high and long jumps. Although nominally an action game, many rooms require knowledge of the player's abilities and can only be navigated in certain ways, frequently giving it an air of a puzzle game. Todd can sustain ordinary damage from many sources, but there are invulnerability shields and pools of water that remove all damage taken when used. Red enemies, when shot, release a spray of red slime that can instantly kill even a shielded player, creating circumstances when it is best not to shoot foes. There is also a type of enemy called a Hidden Snapper, that instantly kills players that step over it. Snappers are often undetectable until triggered, though subtle design cues hint at their location. Players (usually) have infinite lives to explore the world, but lose all their inventory items if Todd dies and are also sent back to the last checkpoint arrow passed. Plot Todd is a galactic explorer who, while in the Andromeda sector, discovered a starship and downloaded part of the captain's log. The log contains information on Slime World, a world teeming with disgusting life forms and the presence of valuable slime gems. =Multiplayer= In the multiplayer scenario there is one single seater escape capsule and the players must fight each other to get to it first. Variations The game contains seven \\"levels\\" that are more akin to game variations, each possessing not just its own map but its own variation on the basic rules. The variations are: *Easy: A relatively simple mode with little red slime or snapjaws, good for learning the game. *Exploration: Players are given a huge map with a great number of secret passages, and many enemies. *Action: The hardest level in terms of enemy opposition. *Logic: A slower-paced, solo-only mode in which the water gun does not work. Players must instead avoid, dodge or outrun foes, or find other ways of defeating them like mega bombs. While checkpoint arrows work, everything else in the world is reset when Todd dies. *Suspense: The player is given a severe time limit within which to escape Slime World. It starts at 3 minutes, but it can be extended by one minute for each mushroom collected. While the route to the exit is mostly linear, there are a number of false routes to confound players. *Combat: Most of the modes can be played cooperatively, but this one is competitive. Everyone gets five lives, and the last player in the game wins. Players may find slime guns to replace their water guns, that are capable of directly harming the other players. There are also other weapons to use, with room-destroying mega bombs at the top of the list. The Combat map is also just as packed with environmental dangers as the other modes. *Arcade: The greatest challenge of Slime World, in this mode the map is almost as dangerous as Action, but the checkpoint arrows do not work. While the map is shorter than some of the other modes, it is still fairly substantial, and the player must start over from the beginning every time a life is lost. In the Lynx version of the game, there are multiple exits from the map. Continuing past the first few exits, the automap will show that the floor layout spells \\"GREEN TODD: OPT 1\\". This is an hint for an Easter egg in the game: the \\"Zit popping game\\". In the Easter egg game players need to repeatedly press the A button to make a slime bubble grow. If the player is fast enough the slime bubble will explode in hundreds of slime drops. Items The items in the game are: *Slime Gem: Very common items that award a large score bonus and also partially heal the player. *Red Slime Gem: Rarer bonus item that awards a tremendous number of points, completely heals the player and gives them an invincibility shield for a while, but if accidentally shot, pops in a spray of deadly red slime. *Triple Shot: Upgrades the water gun to fire three streams of water, useful for tough foes and crowded rooms. *Slime Gun: Changes the player's ammo to slime, capable of harming the other players instead of cleaning them off. However, the many slime monsters of the game are still killed by it. *Shield: Makes the player invulnerable to slime for a limited period and completely heals all damage, but provides no protection against red slime or Snappers. (It does protect against red monsters, though.) *Cleanser: Permanently turns a pool of normal, damaging slime into pure water, capable of healing the player. *Enemy Bait: Draws enemies in the room to its location, where they are killed automatically. It does not work on some monsters, and red monsters still burst in a spray of red slime when killed in this way. *Mega Bomb: When used, is thrown onto the ground a short distance in front of the player, waits a few seconds, then destroys everything in its room in a gigantic explosion. While the explosion does not work on Hidden Snappers (since they lurk in the ground, not in the room), everything else in the game can be destroyed by bombs: monsters, players, items, pools of slime and water, and even checkpoint arrows. *Jet Pack: Gives the player the ability to fly for a limited time. Players cannot fire while flying, and pools are incredibly dangerous while using a Jet Pack, causing an explosion like a Mega Bomb if one is flown into liquid. Development Peter Engelbrite who worked for Epyx one of the programming divisions at Atari stated in his interview with Retro Gamer Magazine that \\"I saw that many of the movies for kids around that time had at least some slime in them\\" and commented that it was the \\"current craze\\" in the 1990s. Engelbrite went on to develop the game which also included the option to link up eight Atari Lynx machines through its Comlynx system. This was then credited to be the first eight player game ever created and the only eight player game on the Lynx. Matt Householder of Epyx was charged with porting the game from the Lynx to Sega Genesis and PC Engine CD. The Genesis and PC Engine CD versions were changed to two player split screen, had different sound tracks and the map moved to the top right corner.  Reception  =Atari Lynx= In a capsule review of the Lynx version for STart, Clayton Walnum called the game \\"Wonderfully gross\\" and \\"a guaranteed hit.\\" CVG Magazine reviewed the game in their January 1991 issue calling it a \\"superb exploration game\\", \\"highly original\\", \\"with plenty of long-lasting appeal\\" giving a score of 90 out of 100. Robert A. Jung reviewed the Atari Lynx version of the game in IGN. In his final verdict, he stated that \\"Todd's Adventures in Slime World will appeal mostly to players who enjoy the idea of exploring every nook and cranny of its vast, gooey terrain. For others, however, the appeal is not as distinct; depending on personal preferences and the availability of friends, the value of this card will vary significantly.\\" He gave the game 7 out of 10. Marshal Rosenthal reviewed the game in the short lived Raze Magazine giving a score of 92%. =Sega Genesis= N. Somniac of GamePro characterized the Genesis version as \\"a faithful translation\\" of the Lynx version which benefits from the large screen presentation. He was especially impressed that the multiplayer mode was adapted to split-screen format without significant slowdown or reduction in graphic quality. Additionally praising the convenience of the restart/password feature and the variety of gameplay possibilities resulting from the many features, he concluded, \\"Sharp graphics, an engaging story line, and a nice mixture of action and suspense guarantees a messy, but fun-filled, time for all!\\" Most of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed that the Genesis version improved on the presentation of the Lynx original, though Martin Alessi contended the controls are not nearly as good, affecting the playability. Steve Harris found the essential gameplay concept \\"awkward and flat\\", while Ed Semrad and Sushi-X had more positive reactions, praising the long levels and challenge. They gave it a 6.25 out of 10. In a 2006 retrospective review, Benjamin Galway of Sega-16 stated that the Genesis version's reduction of the multiplayer mode from eight players to two, along with its addition of an ever-present map to eliminate any possibility of getting lost, takes away most of the game's appeal. He also stated that the background graphics, animations, and color palette are inferior to the Lynx version's, and while the play control is the same, this is not a positive since the original had clunky and unnatural control. He nonetheless gave it a 7 out of 10. =Awards= Todd's Adventures in Slime World was awarded Game Players Magazine' game of the year.

Karlos and Urkiola are spelled in Basque, not the Spanish Carlos and Urquiola, but Arguiñano is spelled in Spanish, not the Basque Argiñano. (born September 6, 1948) is a Spanish chef, popular TV presenter and producer, and Basque pelota businessman. His devotion to cuisine started when he was a child and helped at home because he was the eldest of four siblings and had a disabled mother. Before beginning his training in the field of cooking, he worked for CAF, a rail car manufacturer at Beasain. When he was 17 years old, he decided to take part in a course at the Escuela de Hostelería del Hotel Euromar where, over three years, he was taught the main principles of cooking by Luis Irizar. There he met some people who have gone on to achieve great success in the world of cuisine, such as Pedro Subijana and Ramón Roteta. Karlos Arguiñano's restaurant Arguiñano has had a hotel-restaurant on the beach at Zarautz since 1978. He was one of the first TV chefs in Spain with his cooking show, La cocina de Karlos Arguiñano , first on Euskal Telebista, later on Televisión Española, Argentine ATC, back in Spain with Telecinco and, since September 2010 on Antena 3. Arguiñano combines recipe preparation with tips, jokes and amateur singing.

In June 1916 he was seriously wounded and captured by the Germans. As a brigadier-general he was one of the highest ranked Canadians ever captured by the enemy. Early life and education Williams was born at Port Hope, Ontario in 1867, the son of Arthur Trefusis Heneage Williams, by his wife Emily, daughter of Benjamin Seymour. After attending Trinity College School in Port Hope, he entered the Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Ontario, in 1884. In 1886, “Williams was one of four new Inspectors who had attended the Royal Military College in Kingston. The other three officers were: S.T. Wood, P.C.H. Primrose, and T.W. Chalmers.\\" Two years into his studies he was withdrawn from the college at his parents' request and entered service in the North-West Mounted Police. In December 1887 he was gazetted an inspector. Army career He transferred to the Mounted Infantry in 1889. He married Helen Euphemia Sutherland on October 23, 1890. He eventually took a commission with the Royal Canadian Dragoons in 1893. In 1899 he went to South Africa, serving as a major and lieutenant-colonel in command of 'B' Squadron of the Canadian Mounted Rifles during the Second Boer War. Williams was promoted brevet colonel for his overseas service and appointed commandant of the Royal School of Cavalry in Toronto, Ontario. In 1907 he was appointed commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Dragoons and Inspector of Cavalry for the Dominion of Canada. In 1911 he commanded the mounted units at the Coronation of King George V. From 1912 to 1914 he was Adjutant-General at Ottawa. He commanded Valcartier Camp, Quebec, during the mobilization of the 1st Canadian Division, and accompanied the contingent overseas. During the war he served on the general staffs of Field Marshal Sir John French and the British II and III Corps. As a brigadier-general, he commanded the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division from December 1915 to June 1916. He was mentioned in despatches on 30 April 1916 for gallant and distinguished services in the field. He was severely wounded and taken prisoner on June 3, 1916 during the Battle of Mont Sorrel. He was released in a prisoner exchange before the end of the war. He returned to Canada in late 1918. After the war, he was promoted major-general in command of Military District 2 based in Toronto. He then commanded military districts in Kingston and Toronto. He served as the Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police from 1922 to 1939. He died in Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto on December 12, 1949 and was buried in the St. John's Cemetery in Port Hope. Recognition and honours Mount Williams (2730 metres) in the Canadian Rockies on the border of Alberta and British Columbia was named in his honour in 1918.

It is in the Avon valley, between Bath and Freshford and is both above and below the A36 road. The parish is surrounded to the north, west and south by the Bath and North East Somerset district and includes the outskirts of the Somerset villages of Freshford and Midford. The Avon forms the eastern boundary of the parish, and its tributary the Midford Brook is the boundary in the north and west. History The 18th-century country house at Waterhouse is a Grade II listed building. Limpley Stoke was the westernmost part of the ancient hundred of Bradford, and a tithing of Bradford parish, which was divided into civil parishes in 1894. A small Baptist chapel was built on Middle Stoke in 1815 and rebuilt in 1888, providing 150 seats. The chapel closed in the 1970s. A National School was opened on Middle Stoke in 1845; in 1893 there were 51 pupils. The school closed in 1932 owing to low pupil numbers, and the building is now the village hall. In 1885 Messrs E G Browne and J C Margetson acquired a cloth mill, known as Avon Mill, on the banks of the River Avon at Limpley Stoke. The previous owners of the mill had originally been timber merchants, but had later diversified into the production of rubber goods. By 1890 the business had transferred to premises in Melksham and later became Avon Rubber. The village has two public houses, one of which, The Hop Pole, dating from the 17th century, was used in the filming of The Remains of the Day with Anthony Hopkins. A landmark water tower, actually located close by in Friary Wood,http://www.prattfamily.demon.co.uk/mikep/phot14.html is referred to as the Limpley Stoke Water Tower. =Canals and railways= The Kennet and Avon Canal was built in 1804 through the Avon valley, on the other side of the parish boundary. The Somerset Coal Canal opened in 1805; it followed the Midford Brook, again just beyond the parish boundary, to join the Kennet and Avon next to the Dundas Aqueduct in Monkton Combe parish. In 1857 the Great Western Railway (GWR) built their branch from Staverton Junction, north of Trowbridge, via Bradford on Avon to join their main line at Bathampton. The line follows the Avon valley, on the Limpley Stoke side of the river; Limpley Stoke station was below the north end of the village. The Coal Canal closed in 1898 and its route was bought by the GWR, who used it to extend their Bristol and North Somerset Railway from Camerton to Limpley Stoke; this line opened in 1910. Passenger traffic was light and ceased in 1925. Goods service from Camerton continued until 1951 and the track was lifted in 1958. Limpley Stoke station closed in 1966. The line remains open, as part of the Wessex Main Line. The Kennet and Avon Canal fell into decline and almost closed in the 1950s, but restoration began in the 1970s and the whole canal was reopened in 1990. Parish church St Mary's Church The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary dates from the 10th century; it was first dedicated to the Wiltshire saint Edith of Wilton, but in the 16th century, after some five hundred years, was rededicated to St Mary.Kate Pratt, St Edith at bishopwilton.com The present building was begun in the early 13th century, and the north porch has an arch of that period. The short west tower was added in the 15th century; restoration in 1870 was of limited scope, leading Pevsner to describe the church as \\"unrestored\\". When a south aisle and vestry were added in 1921 to designs of Charles Nicholson, a Saxon arch was incorporated in the arcade. The stone pulpit is from the 15th century. There is one bell, cast in 1596. Stained glass includes a 1932 memorial by A.K. Nicholson. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1962. The early church was annexed to the church at Bradford. In 1846 the chapelry of Limpley Stoke was joined with that of Winsley to form a perpetual curacy; a new parish, Winsley with Limpley Stoke, was created in 1868. In 1970 the parish was uncoupled from Winsley and united with Freshford, in the diocese of Bath and Wells. In 1976 the parish of Hinton Charterhouse was added, thus today the church is in the parish of Freshford with Limpley Stoke and Hinton Charterhouse, alongside St Peter's, Freshford and St John the Baptist, Hinton Charterhouse.

History St Mary's Church is one of three churches that were built in Sheffield under the Church Building Act 1818 (the other two being St George's Church, Portobello and St Philip's Church, Netherthorpe), and is the only one still to be used as a church. The church was designed by Joseph Potter and cost £13,927 (). A grant of £13,941 was received from the Church Building Commission to cover the cost of building and other expenses. The foundation stone was laid on 12 October 1826 by the Countess of Surrey, and the church was consecrated on 21 July 1830. The church is built in the Perpendicular style, with a high tower, It was damaged by bombing during the \\"Sheffield Blitz\\" and when restored was divided: the chancel and two east bays of the nave remained in use as a church, the rest of the building used as a community centre. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated grade II* listed building. =Present day= In 2000, a major internal refurbishment took place resulting in the church and community centre becoming a combined space. The space is also used to host conferences. There are close links between the church and Sheffield United F.C., whose ground is situated on Bramall Lane. During the refurbishment in 2000, church services took place at the football club.

Spacecraft appearing in the Original Trilogy =Death Star= The Death Star is the Empire's battle station which can destroy planets. It appears throughout the Star Wars franchise, particularly the original trilogy. =Executor (Super Star Destroyer)= The Executor serves as Darth Vader's personal flagship during the events of The Empire Strikes Back, leading the Death Squadron against the Rebel Alliance on Hoth and in pursuit of the Millennium Falcon. It features again in Return of the Jedi where, during the final space battle, it is destroyed after a Rebel A-wing crashes into the command bridge, causing the Executor to lose control and be destroyed as the second Death Star's gravity pulls the flagship into its surface.Walker (2018), p. 197Barr, et al. (2019), p. 330 For The Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas wanted the Executor to be so massive it made the previous Star Destroyers appear tiny. A six-foot model of the Executor was constructed which had over 150,000 individual lights in it. According to chief model maker Lorne Peterson, the ship was originally scaled to appear sixteen miles long, though later sources would amend this figure. According to in-universe Star Wars sources, the Executor was the lead ship of a new class of Star Dreadnoughts; the term \\"Super Star Destroyer\\" is an colloquialism applied to any ship larger than a standard Imperial Star Destroyer. At long, the ship bristles with thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons, missile launchers and tractor beams. It similarly carries more than a thousand ships including TIE Fighters. =Home One (Mon Calamari Cruiser)= Home One made its theatrical appearance in Return of the Jedi as Admiral Ackbar's flagship during the Battle of Endor. The model's design, as well as that of other Mon Calamari cruisers to appear in the film, was a collaborative effort between George Lucas, Nilo Rodis-Jamero, and Joe Johnston. The more organic look of the cruisers was a stark contrast to the design of the Empire's ships, and likened by special effects supervisor Ken Ralston to \\"a Moebius drawing.\\" Background material identifies Home One as an MC80A Star Cruiser, a class of ship originally built by the Mon Calamari for deep-space exploration but retrofitted for war. Because it serves as Admiral Ackbar's command and control center, it is also known as the Headquarters Frigate. The largest and most advanced capital ship in the Rebel Alliance fleet, Home One is long and features extensive weaponry with twenty-nine turbolaser batteries, thirty-six ion cannon batteries, and six tractor beam projectors. Twenty hangers allow Home One to function as a carrier for starfighter squadrons and other ships. Some sections of Home One are also filled with water to replicate the natural environment of the Mon Calamari's homeworld.Walker (2018), p. 199Barr, et al. (2019), p. 333 =Imperial landing craft (Sentinel-class landing craft)= Imperial landing craft (or Sentinel-class landing craft) were designed for the Special Edition release of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and created entirely with CGI. However, they first appeared in products of the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire multimedia campaign. According to in- universe sources, the primary mission for Sentinel-class craft is deploying Imperial military forces from orbit onto a planet, though it can be used for other missions including short-range scouting, cargo transport and close air support. Heavily armored and equipped with powerful deflector shields, Imperial landers carry eight laser cannons, two concussion missile launchers, two blaster cannons and an ion cannon turret. As a troop transport it can carry 54 stormtroopers into battle, or carry vehicles via cargo pod installed on its underside.Walker (2018), p. 143Barr, et al. (2019), p. 322 =Imperial shuttle (Lambda-class shuttle)= Lambda-class T4a shuttles first appeared in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and were later added to the Special Edition release of The Empire Strikes Back. Joe Johnston, Ralph McQuarrie, and Nilo Rodis-Jamero borrowed elements from the skyhopper designed for A New Hope when refining the shuttle's appearance. Earlier versions were boxy, boat-like, or had TIE fighter-like components. Industrial Light and Magic's modelmakers made two shooting models, although CGI versions were used for the craft's Special Edition appearance in The Empire Strikes Back. The Theta-class shuttle in Revenge of the Sith was designed to appear like a predecessor to the Lambda class. A Lambda-class shuttle makes a cameo appearance during the docking sequence of Inara Serra's shuttle in \\"Serenity\\", the pilot episode of Joss Whedon's Firefly. =Imperial Star Destroyer= The Star Destroyers are the Galactic Empire's assault ships. Much like the Republic assault ships, the two have similar hulls, bridges, engines, and many other parts. They appear in a variety of forms throughout the Star Wars franchise. The Ravager, the first of the Ravager-class star destroyers, was destroyed during the Battle of Jakku. =Millennium Falcon (YT-1300 light freighter)= The Millennium Falcon is a highly modified YT-1300F light freighter captained by smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). The YT-1300 Corellian light freighter, manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, was essentially a giant \\"forklift\\" designed to tug around giant container ships. As one of the most successful designs in history, the appeal of the vessel is not its basic equipment, but its modular ability to take an extraordinary amount of modifications and alterations. But the downside is the cockpit being placed on the right side makes it extremely hard to pilot correctly. Its popularity among freighter captains throughout the galaxy guaranteed commercial operation in the galaxy during the final days of the Galactic Republic and the reign of the Galactic Empire. =Rebel Medical Frigate (Nebulon-B frigate)= Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) receives a prosthetic hand aboard the Redemption, a modified Nebulon-B escort frigate, at the conclusion of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. A Nebulon-B medical frigate is part of the Rebel Alliance fleet at the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi. Expanded Universe material states that relatively affordable Nebulon-B frigates, which are effective at engaging starfighters, are used by both the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire. The frigates appear in several LucasArts titles, including the X-Wing flight simulators series, Empire at War real-time strategy game, and Star Wars: Battlefront, as well as episodes 'Zero Hour' and 'Secret Cargo' of Star Wars Rebels. Industrial Light & Magic's Nilo Rodis-Jamero and Joe Johnston created the frigate late during work on The Empire Strikes Back, with the design following a suggestion by George Lucas that it be based on an outboard motor. The model was produced in a short time with limited financial access; it was primarily built from components left over from previous kitbashing exercises, including battleship hulls and artillery pieces. The resulting model was long, tall, and included a \\"window\\" where a still from the scene in the medical bay could be inserted for filming. Following the completion of filming, Lucas decided to revisit the end of the movie to better establish the characters' final locations, requiring a section of the frigate to be built that corresponded to the scale of the Millennium Falcon model. The model was originally referred to as the Rebel starcruiser or Rebel cruiser, but during filming of Return of the Jedi, it was renamed Rebel Medical Frigate after the cruiser name was used for the Mon Calamari cruisers. According to in-universe sources, the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a versatile design which can be modified to fulfill a variety of different roles, from long-range scouting to search-and-rescue missions. When fully armed, the -long frigate is equipped with twelve turbolasers, twelve laser cannons, and a pair of tractor beam projectors, and can carry a full squadron of starfighters. The design is most famous for serving as medical frigates, with full-service hospital facilities and a capacity for 700 patients.Walker (2018), p. 190Barr, et al. (2019), p. 332 =Rebel Transport (GR-75 medium transport)= GR-75 medium transports are a class of ship which first appears in The Empire Strikes Back during the evacuation of Echo Base on Hoth, and have made appearances in other media. Only long, these ships are described in Star Wars sources as largely consisting of a thick outer hull with its interior entirely open for modular cargo pods. These are held in place by a magnetic shield and allows the transport to accommodate of cargo. Cheap and easy to maintain, these transports are only equipped with four twin laser cannons and minimal deflector shields, though some are retrofitted for combat.Walker (2018), p. 178Barr, et al. (2019), p. 331 =Slave I= Slave I is the starship used by bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) in The Empire Strikes Back and by his father Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) in Attack of the Clones. The ship's design is said to resemble the shape of a street lamp. However, the actual inspiration for the shape of the ship was a radar dish, according to Nilo Rodis-Jamero, the assistant art director and visual effects creator on The Empire Strikes Back. Rodis-Jamero created the initial design after seeing Joe Johnston's ideas for Boba Fett, and states that \\"the original design I had was round, but when you looked at it from the side, it became elliptical...George [Lucas] thought it was elliptical, so that's what it became.\\" He goes on to say that \\"[w]hen building the ship at ILM, someone looked at the street lamps and pointed out that they looked like Boba's ship. So everyone began to think that was where I got the idea for the design.\\" Its appearance in the original release of The Empire Strikes Back was realized by a combination of matte paintings and a model. =Tantive IV (Rebel Blockade Runner)= The Tantive IV, identified in source material as a CR90 Corellian corvette, first appears in the opening scene of the original Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, commanded by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) as she evades pursuit from Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 306 Her adoptive father Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) is seen using a similar vessel during the prequel movie Revenge of the Sith, identified in source material as the CR70 model Tantive III.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 102 Corellian corvettes, also known as Rebel Blockade Runners for their powerful engine array and ability to outrun customs vessels, are manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.Walker (2018), p. 188 Spacecraft appearing in the Prequel Trilogy =Dooku's solar sailer= Darth Tyranus, also known as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), reaches Coruscant near the end of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones aboard a Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop, better known as a \\"solar sailer\\", built by the Huppla Pasa Tisc Shipwright Collective. The ship, which also appears multiple times in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, is equipped with a solar sail which was originally part of the concept for the Naboo royal starship in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. However the model was redesigned to reflect the harsher environment of Geonosis and the insectoid Geonosians, resembling both a beetle and a butterfly. Originally it was to have separate pilot and passenger compartments, but during production this was altered and a forward cockpit bubble was added when it was determined there was a need for a shot of Dooku sitting next to his pilot. It is somewhat similar to the private Antonov An-2 plane in real life. During filming of Attack of the Clones, a full-size model of the sailer was built in order to stage the lightsaber duel between Count Dooku and Yoda (Frank Oz). According to Star Wars canon sources, the solar sailer is a luxurious yacht commissioned by Dooku from his allies on Geonosis prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. While only long, it is surprisingly spacious with room for Dooku's databook library and fast with a Class 1.5 hyperdrive. Instead of carrying fuel, the sailer deploys a wide sail which collects interstellar energy and channels it directly to the engines. To defend it from attack, the vessel is equipped with eighty-four tractor/repulsor beam projectors.Walker (2018), p. 127 =Invisible Hand (Providence-class carrier/destroyer)= General Grievous's flagship in Revenge of the Sith is the Invisible Hand, appearing in the film's opening space battle above the planet Coruscant. With Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) held prisoner aboard the ship, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) launch a rescue mission to save him, boarding the ship where they confront and ultimately defeat Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). With the Invisible Hand crippled in the battle, General Grievous flees aboard an escape pod as the heroes successfully guide it to an emergency landing on the planet below. George Lucas had a personal hand in the design of the ship, including the addition of the raised spire in which Obi-Wan, Anakin and Count Dooku have their duel. The raised spire also helped differentiate the command ship from the other capital ships over Coruscant. While the ship was completely CGI, unlike similarly modeled ships for the film it need a complex interior that was fully mapped out for the various set pieces which take place during the movie. Once the floor plans were approved, they were constructed as both CG and actual rooms, with multiple large-scale sets for the actors to perform in. More sets of rooms aboard the ship were built than seen in the final film; several \\"serial-type escapades\\" were cut from the final release. Other sets, built inside a mount that could rotate them, were used to depict the vessel's collapse.Walker (2019), p. 100 The Invisible Hand is described according to in-universe references as a Providence-class carrier/destroyer, a classification representing the dreadnought's duel roles in planetary domination. At long, the Invisible Hand can unleash tremendous damage with fourteen quad turbolaser cannons, two heavy ion cannons, thirty-four dual laser cannons, twelve point- defense ion cannons, and one hundred proton torpedo launchers. Its hangers can carry twenty starfighter squadrons and more than 400 ground assault vehicles for planetary invasions. Its main upper sensor tower houses an observation platform which provides commanders an unobstructed view of battle.Walker (2018), p. 193Barr, et al. (2019), p. 311 =Naboo Royal Cruiser= Also known as the Naboo Diplomatic Cruiser, this ship makes its theatrical appearance in the opening scene of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The ship is seen being escorted by Naboo N-1 starfighters, carrying Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) to Coruscant for an important vote on the Military Creation Act. After coming to rest on a landing pad, the ship is blown up in an assassination attempt on Senator Amidala's life, though she escapes unharmed. The ship's design was inspired by the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. While the cruiser was entirely CGI, for filming purposes a full-size set of the lading pad was built for the actors with a digital matte painting inserted to create the background. Pyrotechnics were used in the filming of the scene, though the majority of the explosion was created with CGI by visual effects art director Alex Jaeger.Walker (2019), p. 84 Background material on the Diplomatic Cruiser state that it was designed in the wake of the Invasion of Naboo to address shortcomings in the previous J-type 327 starship. Still unarmed and covered in shiny chromium plating, it is nevertheless faster and better shielded, with additional back-up drives in case the main Class 0.7 hyperdrive fails. At long, the vessel's spacious interiors are designed with comfort in mind for four VIPs, six bodyguards and a crew of five. The leading edge of its wing also feature four recharging sockets for N-1 starfighters to dock with the ship.Walker (2018), p. 169Barr, et al. (2019), p. 297 =Naboo Royal Starship= The Naboo Royal Starship features prominently in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as the ship that Queen Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) use to escape from the Trade Federation blockade of Naboo. After arriving on Tatooine where they free young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), the heroes continue aboard the Royal Starship to Coruscant, before finally using it to return to Naboo and free the planet from the Trade Federation's occupation in a climactic battle. An early design depicted the ship powered by a solar sail; when Lucas called for a sleeker look, designer Doug Chiang drew inspiration from 1950s hood ornaments. According to Chiang, the design of the queen's ship was to exemplify Theedian technology the same way the Space Shuttle exemplified the power of technology in America. A thirty inch, highly detailed model of the ship was built, then sliced into one-inch sections and scanned in order to create a digital model. To reduce the amount of CGI work on the film and get more realistic footage of the ship under natural lighting, a larger ten-foot model was also created for filming scenes of the ship when landed.Walker (2019), p. 78 According to in-universe material, the Nabool Royal Starship was meant to be a visual representation of the glory of Naboo. A modified J-type 327 Nubian starship, the vessel's unique spaceframe was handcrafted by the Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corp. and it's decorative plating of royal chromium - reserved only for Naboo's monarch - was hand-polished and crafted by artisans. Lacking weaponry, the -long ship featured state-of-the-art deflector shields and a cohort of astromech droids to make emergency repairs. One drawback was that it's high-performance T-14 hyperdrive, while easy to acquire on many civilized worlds, could be harder to find on more remote planets.Walker (2018), p. 168Barr, et al. (2019), p. 295 =Naboo Star Skiff= Padmé Amidala travels to Mustafar aboard a Naboo star skiff in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith to confront Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) after he turns to the Dark Side. Designer Ryan Church sketched the ship to appear \\"supercharged\\". Only the ship's boarding ramp was built full scale; some footage was altered from material used in Attack of the Clones. The ship is designed to be reminiscent of the \\"rocket ships\\" seen in pulp science-fiction. =Neimoidian Shuttle (Sheathipede-class trasport shuttle)= Neimoidian shuttles first appear in The Phantom Menace and are seen throughout the prequel trilogy and Clone Wars television series. Their design is based on a Trade Federation landing ship, turned vertically and altered to be more insectoid and less symmetrical. They are also used by the other Separatist leaders, such as Nuvo Vindi and Wat Tambor. Star Wars lore refers to these vessels as Sheathipede-class transport shuttles built by the insect-like Charrian species, especially popular with the Neimoidians but used by many worlds associated with the Separatist cause. Intended for short-range diplomatic missions, these -long shuttles feature powerful communication arrays and are unarmed but can be modified for combat. Some also incorporate an automatic pilot, allowing for a more expansive passenger compartment.Walker (2018), p. 125Barr, et al. (2019), p. 294 =Republic Assault Ship (Acclamator-class assault ship)= Republic assault ships of the Acclamator-class first appear in Attack of the Clones. These ships, originally called \\"Jedi troop transports\\", demonstrate a connection to the original trilogy's Star Destroyers through their triangular hulls. According to Star Wars reference material, these assault ships were built by Rothana Heavy Engineering to serve as the Republic's primary troop transport at the start of the Clone Wars, with a secondary offensive role in space battles. At long, these assault ships are unlike many other Star Wars vessels of similar size in that they can land directly on a planet's surface, carrying up to 16,000 clone troopers and their vehicles directly into battle. Their armament includes twelve quad turbolaser turrets, twenty-four laser cannons and four missile launchers.Walker (2018), p. 177Barr, et al. (2019), p. 301 =Republic Attack Cruiser (Venator-class Star Destroyer= Republic attack cruisers, formally known as Venator-class Star Destroyers, made their first theatrical appearance in the opening space battle of Revenge of the Sith and have appeared throughout the Star Wars franchise. Described in-universe as large and powerful battleships of the Republic Navy, attack cruisers are long with a crew of 7,400 and powerfully armed with eight heavy dual turbolaser turrets, two medium dual turbolaser turrets, fifty-two point-defense laser cannons, four heavy proton torpedo launchers and six tractor beam projectors. A -long flight deck is built directly into the ship's prow with bow doors, allowing a quick exit for the vessel's compliment of 420 starfighters, forty LAAT gunships and twenty-four AT-TEs. After the Republic's victory, these cruisers continued to serve under the Galactic Empire.Walker (2018), p. 194Barr, et al. (2019), p. 303 =Republic Cruiser (Consular-class cruiser)= The Consular-class Republic Cruiser Radiant VII is the first vessel seen in The Phantom Menace. Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) travel aboard the Radiant VII on their mission to end the Trade Federation's blockade of the planet Naboo. After docking with the Federation's Droid Control Ship, the Radiant VII is destroyed to prevent the Jedi from escaping. Originally, the Radiant VII was going to be sleek like most Old Republic ships depicted in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. However, Lucas suggested a design similar to the ships in the original trilogy; Doug Chiang and the Lucasfilm art department responded with a design similar to the Tantive IV model created for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Several antennae were added to focus attention to the cockpit during the opening sequence of The Phantom Menace. For filming the destruction of the Radiant VII, the crew built a gigantic seven-foot model and rigged it with pyrotechnics, around which was constructed a to-scale hanger. This use of practical special effects allowed for pieces of the exploding model to interact with the surrounding environment without having to utilize CGI resources.Walker (2019), p. 70 Consular-class Republic Cruisers like the Radiant VII are \\"instantly recognizable throughout the galaxy\\" according to the Star Wars Databank. Built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, these Republic Cruisers are generally unarmed and feature a red color scheme as a symbol of neutrality and \\"diplomatic immunity\\". At long, their features include strong deflector shields, three powerful Dyne 577 radial atomizer engines and a Longe Voltrans tri-arc CD-3.2 hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel. Underneath the bridge is an interchangeable diplomatic salon pod which can eject from the cruiser in an emergency. During the Clone Wars, many Republic Cruisers underwent the Charger c70 retrofit to become Republic Frigates. Slightly longer at , these vessels were retrofitted with additional armor plating, a twin laser cannon and five twin turbolaser cannon turrets.Walker (2018), p. 182 =Scimitar (Sith Infiltrator)= Darth Maul pilots a Sith infiltrator, named Scimitar, in The Phantom Menace. Its design includes elements of the TIE interceptor and Lambda-class shuttle. The vehicle has been made into toys by Hasbro and Galoob and models kits by Lego and Ertl. =Starfreighter= Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker travel to Naboo aboard a starfreighter in Attack of the Clones. The transport's design is partly based on an ocean liner. =Techno Union Starship (Hardcell-class Interstellar Transport)= Techno Union Starships made their theatrical appearance in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis as the Separatist droid army attempts to hold off the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic. Background material on the ship class describes it as a common sight in the Star Wars universe, long with a Class 1 hyperdrive and six large rocket thrusters, but ineffective as a combatant with only two laser cannon batteries. Its lack of repulsorlifts gives it limited maneuverability within a planet's atmosphere and the large fuel stores for its rockets are a glaring weakness that can be exploited during the battle.Walker (2018), p. 175 Of the 286 Techno Union starships at the Battle of Geonosis, 169 escape.Lund, et al. (2016), p. 91 =Theta-class Shuttle= Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) travels aboard a Theta-class shuttle in Revenge of the Sith. The ship was designed to appear like a predecessor to the Lambda-class shuttle. Only the shuttle's boarding ramp was built for filming. =Trade Federation battleship (Lucrehulk-class battleship)= Trade Federation Lucrehulk-class battleships appear in the Prequel trilogy and various other Star Wars media. Lucas called for these ships to have a \\"saucer\\" look with a distinct front and rear, achieved by placing the engines on one side of the ship and the antennae and docking bays on the other. In The Phantom Menace a fleet of these ships enforces a blockade of the planet Naboo, one of which (identified in background material as the Vuutun PalaaWalker (2018), p. 191) serves as the Droid Control Ship at the center of the movie's climactic battle. To capture the Droid Control Ship's destruction, a 1/800 scale model was created and blown up using specially designed pyrotechnic material to simulate a believably massive explosion, and filmed at 340 frames per second to get enough frames for the cut. A second scale model of the ship's hanger was created and mapped out for the scene where Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) accidentally flies his starfighter inside the ship.Walker (2019), p. 81 In- universe, these vessels were originally Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighters that the Trade Federation secretly modified into warships to build up their armed forces. At in diameter, each massive battleship can carry an entire army: 6,250 Armored Assault Tanks, 550 Multi-Troop Transports, 1,500 troop carriers, 50 C-9979 Landing Craft, 1,500 Vulture droids and over 329,000 B1 Battle Droids.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 292 However the conversion was not entirely successful and there were a number of weaknesses to these powerful ships. For example, despite being well-armed with 185 quad laser batteries, 520 assault laser cannons, and 51 turbolasers, blind spots in the armament's coverage left vulnerable angles that enemy ships could target. A small number of these battleships were further modified as Droid Control Ships and featured additional communications and computer systems to operate the Trade Federation's droid armies; destroying a Droid Control Ship would disable all droids under its command. The most famous Lucrehulk-class ship is the Trade Federation flagship cargo freighter Saak'ak, controlling the Invasion of Naboo in The Phantom Menace. =Trade Federation Landing Ship= Trade Federation Landing Ships transport the Trade Federation's invasion forces to Naboo's surface in The Phantom Menace and have appeared in other Star Wars media. Although initial designs were reminiscent of dirigibles, the final design is based on a dragonfly. George Lucas likened the ship's similarity to a biplane. In addition to digital models, an eight-foot-wide scale model of the lander was built to film scenes of these craft landing on Naboo's surface. Another larger-scale model of the lander's doorway was built to film scenes of Trade Federation vehicles exiting the craft. Formally known within the setting as a C-9979 Landing Craft, these vessels have an imposing wingspan which is used to store a tremendous number of vehicles: 114 Armored Assault Tanks, 11 Multi- troop transports and 28 troop carriers. Powerful tensor field generators bind these removable wings to the vessel while \\"repulsorlifts\\" keep them from sagging under their own weight. Manufactured for the Trade Federation by Haor Chall Engineering, the -long vessel has a crew of 88 battle droids and is armed with wingtip and turret-mounted laser cannons.Walker (2018), p. 174Barr et al. (2019), p. 293 Spacecraft appearing in other Star Wars media =Ghost (VCX-100 light freighter)= The Ghost is a modified VCX-100 light freighter, manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, appearing in the Star Wars Rebels television series. Owned and piloted by the gifted Twi'lek, Hera Syndulla (voiced by Vanessa Marshall), it serves as \\"home base\\" for a small band of Lothal rebels during the Age of the Empire. Named for its ability to travel past Imperial sensors without detection on numerous missions and skirmishes, the craft included many hidden surprises that aided the crew in their fight against the Empire. Among its many features were a 360-degree dorsal laser cannon turret The Ghost makes a cameo appearance in Rogue One near the Great Temple of Massassi on Yavin IV. Its captain, Hera Syndulla, is briefly mentioned in the film, and its repair droid, Chopper, makes a brief appearance inside the Temple. Han Solo pretends to own a spacecraft of the same model in Solo: A Star Wars Story, during the Sabacc game in which he first met Lando Calrissian. =Hammerhead corvette (Sphyrna-class corvette)= The Hammerhead corvette is a ship class that originally appeared in the Star Wars Rebels television series and was given a prominent role in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story during the final space battle when one of these ships rammed a disabled Imperial Star Destroyer into another. Its CGI design was purposefully meant to be evocative of the Tantive IV from the original Star Wars film. The in-universe origin for Hammerhead corvettes, formally known as Sphyrna-class corvettes, is that they are an ancient line of ships built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation. Reliable and adaptable, these corvettes are long and armed with two forward and one rear dual laser cannons, but can be modified with additional sublight engines and add-on modules. They are used by the Rebel Alliance in many different roles: scout ships, tugs, transports, and even battleships.Walker (2018), p. 189Barr, et al. (2019), p. 323 Rhett Allain, an associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, estimated in a 2017 article for Wired that the Hammerhead's engines in Rogue One would had to have generated (or 200 billion) Newtons of force in order for it to push the Star Destroyer. This would be 6,000 times the amount of thrust force generated by a Saturn V rocket. =Imperial Freighter (Gozanti-class cruiser)= The term Imperial Freighter refers to a type of Gozanti-class cruiser, which first appeared as a background vessel in The Phantom Menace and has appeared in other Star Wars media, most notably the Star Wars Rebels television series. Reference material describes Gozanti-class cruisers as being used by a variety of factions, but those in Imperial service have stronger deflector shields, quicker engines and better weaponry to deter pirates and rebels from stealing their cargo. In addition to a dorsal twin laser cannon turret and ventral heavy laser cannon turret, these -long ships can carry four TIE fighters via extendable docking clamps. Gozanti-class Assault Carriers are equipped with magnetic docking clamps that allow them to carry a pair of Walkers for planetary assaults.Walker (2018), p. 163Barr, et al. (2019), p. 321Lund (2016), p. 143Windham (2019), p. 78-79 Another variant, the IGV-55 Surveillance Vessel, is equipped with multiple listening arrays, modified sensor-dampened engines, and a computer database to store billions of yottabytes of data.Walker (2018), p. 164 =Imperial / Jedi Light Cruiser (Arquitens-class light cruiser)= The Arquitens-class light cruiser is a vessel which first appears in the 2008 Clone Wars television series as well as the Star Wars Rebels television series. Source material describes it as serving the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars as a light warship, earning the nickname Jedi Light Cruiser. After the Republic's victory it continued to serve the Galactic Empire in the same capacity, though under the name Imperial Light Cruiser. Armed with four double-barrel turbolaser batteries and four quad laser turrets, Arquitens-class ships can absorb a surprising amount of damage thanks to their armored hulls and layers of energy shielding.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 307 =Outrider (YT-2400 freighter)= Within Star Wars Legends, the Outrider is Dash Rendar's CEC YT-2400 class freighter in the Shadows of the Empire multimedia campaign. It is a playable ship in the Shadows of the Empire video game, and Kenner released an Outrider toy. While Steve Perry outlined the ship's story and role, Doug Chiang designed the ship itself. The Outrider was digitally inserted into the Special Edition of A New Hope. A YT-2400 light freighter also appeared within the Star Wars Rebels Season 3 episode Iron Squadron. It was piloted by Mart Mattin, who was a nephew of Rebel Commander, Jun Sato.http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/20/star-wars-rebels-iron-squadron- review It is unknown if the ship is meant to be same as the one in A New Hope. According to Gary Whitta, who served as writer of Rogue One, Dash Rendar is a controversial character among Lucasfilm Story Group, which decreases the chances of the character becoming part of canon.http://screenrant.com/dash- rendar-star-wars-canon/ =Profundity (Mon Calamari cruiser)= The Profundity first appears in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, leading the Rebel fleet's attack on Scarif under Admiral Raddus. It is identified in Star Wars sources as a modified MC75 star cruiser, a class of Mon Calamari buildings and exploration ships which have been repurposed for war. The Profundity itself was the former Civic Governance tower of the city of Nystullum during the Mon Calamari's exodus from their homeworld. At long, the Profundity has a crew of 3,225 and is heavily armed with twelve turbolaser cannons, four ion cannons, twenty point-defense laser cannons, twelve proton torpedo launchers and six tractor beam projectors.Walker (2018), p. 198Barr, et al. (2019), p. 327 =Razor Crest= A pre-Imperial patrol gunship owned and piloted by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin in the Disney+ web-series \\"The Mandalorian\\". =Stinger Mantis= The Stinger Mantis, more commonly known as the Mantis, was an S-161 \\"Stinger\\" XL luxury yacht piloted by Greez Dritus in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Spacecraft appearing in Star Wars Legends A number of named vessels appear only in Star Wars Legends sources, material which was branded non-canon after The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm. The Ebon Hawk is Darth Revan's ship in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Revan, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. It is designed to be reminiscent of the Millennium Falcon. The Moldy Crow is a modified Corellian HWK-290 used by Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors in the Star Wars: Dark Forces and Star Wars: Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight video games. After it is destroyed in Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, it is replaced with the Raven's Claw. The Rogue Shadow is the ship used by Starkiller and Juno Eclipse in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. The Virago is Xizor's ship in Shadows of the Empire. Its clamshell design, styled after a stealth fighter, is inspired by pulley castings. The Wild Karrde is medium-sized freight vessel used by smuggler Talon Karrde in Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire novels.

Origin Before the founding of modern China in 1911, concubinage was legal. In Chinese custom, males carry the family name and the family's heritage after marriage. To ensure male heirs were produced, it was a common practice for an upper-class married male to have one or more concubines, provided he could support them.Morris, Peter Thomas. (1992) Cantonese Love Songs: An English Translation of Jiu Ji-Yung's Cantonese Songs of the Early 19th century. Hong Kong University. The custom could be invoked without the wife's consent: the husband's actions were protected by law. Concubines would co-exist in the family along with wives and children. A man might choose a courtesan to be his concubine. Many of these courtesans would sing songs to attract potential husbands, hoping to become secondary wives. Terminology Western observers in China during the nineteenth century witnessed these women singing but had no idea what to call them since they were not classified as prostitutes. Thus the term \\"Sing-Song Girls\\" came about. There is another version of the source of the term. According to the 1892 fictional masterpiece by Han Bangqing called Sing-Song Girls of Shanghai, also known as Flowers of Shanghai, people in Shanghai called the women who performed in sing-song houses \\"xian sheng\\" () in Wu language. The term was pronounced like \\"sing-song\\" in English and the young women always sang to entertain the customers; thus Westerners called them Sing-Song girls. The word sian sang in this case is a polite term used to refer to an entertainer. Their lives Sing-song girls were trained from childhood to entertain wealthy male clients through companionship, singing and dancing in special sing-song houses. Not all performed sexual services, but many did. They generally saw themselves as lovers and not prostitutes. Sing- song girls did not have distinctive costumes or make-up. Often they wore Shanghai cheongsam as upper-class Chinese women did. Sing-song girls often performed amateur versions of Chinese opera for clients and often wore the traditional Chinese opera costume for small group performance. The girls had one or several male sponsors who might or might not be married and relied on these sponsors to pay off family or personal debts or to sustain their high standard of living. Many sing-song girls married their sponsors to start a free life. Classes Among sing-song girls were actually several subclasses of performers divided by the quality of skill. Over time, these would evolve, beginning with one class, developing into four, and consolidating down to two before becoming obsolete during the Cultural Revolution. * Shuyu – Highest class were the Shuyu (storytellers), who traced their professional roots back to ancient imperial entertainers. These were skilled in cultured entertainments such as singing, playing instruments, writing poetry, and performing opera. Additionally, these were picked for beauty, trained in sophisticated conversation, and known for their extravagant dress. They were not known for their sexual services so much as for their artistry. Given time, the Shuyu class of entertainer would become assimilated into the Changsan class of prostitutes as a result of their reluctance towards offering sexual services.Hershatter, Gail. “The Hierarchy of Shanghai Prostitution, 1870–1949.” Modern China, vol. 15, no. 4, 1989, pp. 463–498., www.jstor.org/stable/189241. * Changsan – The Changsan (\\"long three\\") were the highest class of prostitutes. The term originally came from them charging three yuan for company and three more to spend the night. They maintained the class and artistry akin to the Shuyu, while still being distinctly part of the sex trade. For instance, their intimate company would require an elaborate period of courtship. Still, however, such relations were neither permanent nor monogamous. * Yao'er – The Yao'er (\\"one two\\") was the lower tier equivalent of the Changsan. It was named this way because they traditionally charged one yuan for entertainment and two for company. Originally there was an intermediary class called the Ersan (\\"two three\\") however, over times these became considered the same class as the Changsan. While Yao'er prostitutes were lower tier than Changsan, they still focused on entertainment as well as sexual services. However, they charged less than the Changsan, and accordingly their beauty, singing, and performances were not as good. Classes of other sex workers Below these, fell those whose services were purely sexual. Where some sing-song girls worked as such by choice, the women serving in the lowest tiers of the sex trade were often there as a result of being sold, mortgaged, kidnapped, or otherwise forced into the industry. (These do not address the women in other industries, such as masseuses and taxi dancers, who part-time sold sexual services.) * \\"Salt pork\\" – These prostitutes were housed in brothels which focused entirely on selling sexual services. These houses were colloquially named \\"salt pork shops\\" for the similarities between the selling of these women's bodies and of the division and selling of salt pork. Unlike the sing-song girls, these women had almost no say regarding their lives and services, as rather than performing, they were simply having their bodies rented. * \\"Pheasants\\" – The next class of prostitutes were streetwalkers. Being in the streets, they had little protection from law enforcement and thugs, leaving them doubly at risk of arrest or assault. An example of this can be found in the 1934 silent film The Goddess (神女).The Goddess. Fir. Wu Yonggang. Lianhua Film Company, 1934. Silent Film. That said, a majority of \\"pheasants\\" did belong to brothels and would bring their customers back to service them. They were called \\"pheasants\\" for their gaudy dress and habit of scouring the streets for customers. * \\"Flowers\\" – Coming from the term \\"flower-smoke rooms,\\" this and the following were the lowest class of prostitutes. Flower smoke rooms were opium dens where customers could have prostitutes while smoking opium. This class of prostitutes disappeared before the Cultural Revolution Reforms with the ban of opium. * \\"Nailsheds\\" – These brothels were targeted towards low class laborers such as rickshaw pullers. Historical use of the term * The concept has been around for 2,000 years as recorded by emperors of the Han Dynasty who needed to provide female entertainment for troop amusement. In ancient China, many terms were given to these entertainers, such as \\"gē jì\\" (), \\"gē jī\\" (), \\"ōu zhě\\" (), etc. * The English term came from 1911 (see Origin). * During the 1930s, Li Jinhui started the Chinese popular music industry with a number of musical troupes. The groups were mostly young women performing and singing. The term Sing-Song- Girls stuck, since the Communist Party of China associated pop music as Yellow Music or pornography in the 1940s.Jones. Andrew F. (2001). Yellow Music – CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. Cultural impact In Shanghai, Sing-song girls became a unique part of the city's culture, one which, in turn, affected the culture of other parts of China. As Shanghai was divided into different concessions loosely governed by multiple parties, there was greater freedom there for sing-song girls to come into the public eye without legal repercussions. This opened the door, allowing for the entertainment culture of the sing-song girls to impact the more traditional Chinese culture. While even the highest class Changsan could not escape the ignominy of the sex trade, in some ways, that liberated her to flaunt a provocative culture which conservative Chinese tradition would not allow. Traditional views held that once married, a woman had no need to impress anyone. In conjunction with Confucian ideals of the virtues of modesty, this led to a standard of dress aimed to hide the form of the body within. However, sing-song girls, being unburdened such virtues, unmarried and perpetually courting were free not only to explore high fashion, but also to adapt it to be more. An example of this can be seen in the cheongsam which not only became more form fitting, but also became sleeveless with a long slit running up each side.NG, S. Gendered by Design: Qipao and Society, 1911–1949. Costume: Journal of The Costume Society. 49, 1, 55–74, Jan. 2015. . In general, the fact that sing-song girls were solely focused on entertainment meant that they were able to push the envelope of culture and style. For instance, they often decorated their parlors with expensive decor and modern amenities, making them culturally progressive to the point where there are documented cases of women sneaking into the entertainment houses to catch a glimpse of what the latest decorations and fashions were. Additionally, the fact that the sing-song girls were often courted by prominent individuals in society gave them further attention, even notoriety. For instance, it was not uncommon for famous sing-song girls to be invited to publicly accompany their courters allowing for them to further flaunt their fashion.YEH, CV. Shanghai love : courtesans, intellectuals, and entertainment culture, 1850–1910. Seattle : University of Washington Press, c2006. pp. 21–95, 2006. Sing-song girls would also be some of the first individuals in Chinese society to penetrate mass media. For instance, some sing-song girls began to use portraits of themselves as a way to attract business, early business cards. Moreover, the advent of mass advertisement and its use of women to market products resulted in the circulation of images of famous sing-song girls being displayed as the apparent standard of dress and beauty.COCHRAN, S. Chinese medicine men : consumer culture in China and Southeast Asia. Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2006. pp. 62–97, 2006. . In a way, at least in Shanghai, the highest class sing-song girls became the first modern celebrities. Their fame came to them, not because of their virtues and industry, rather because of their association with high culture and the latest fashion. Accordingly, they used that fame to continue stretching the confines placed by conservative culture in ways which popularized modern technology and the expression of feminine sexuality. Fiction * Sing-song girls are popularized in the 1892 novel by Han Bangqing called Sing-Song Girls of Shanghai (also known as Flowers of Shanghai). * Sing-song girls play a minor role in Isabel Allende's Daughter of Fortune (Hija de la fortuna).

He tries to help those girls who manage to recover to improve their lives so that they no longer need to prostitute themselves. * Allende also mentions sing-song girls in her book Portrait in Sepia (Retrato en Sepia). * Amitav Ghosh's novel River of Smoke, set in southern Chinese port cities, refers to prostitutes in Canton as \\"sing- song girls.\\" See also * Oiran * Tawaif, similar profession during colonial India *Yiji References History of Shanghai Courtesans by type ","title":"Sing-song girls"},{"id":"4042866","text":"John Edward MacDonell is Past President of the Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia.

The construction as well as the shape of it was designed by inz. Kazimierz Zembrzuski, head of the design office in the First Polish Factory of Locomotives and at the same time professor of the Warsaw University of Technology. The other (Pm36-2) had a standard look. The idea was to test both engines in parallel to compare top speed, acceleration, coal and water consumption etc. The Pm36-1 won a gold medal at the 1937 International Exposition of Art and Technology in Paris. =Service= After the German occupation of Poland during World War II, the two locomotives were renumbered into the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) fleet as 18 601 and 18 602 (class 186). The 18 601 had its streamlining removed, but was later damaged and subsequently scrapped (probably in 1942). The 18 602 survived the war, and was returned to Poland where it regained its PKP class and number. It continued to work for PKP until 1965, when it was given to the Warsaw Railway Museum. =Present day= In 1995 the machine went through a major overhaul and is now working in Wolsztyn as a tourist attraction, called Beautiful Helen (pl.

The river was once so pristine that the water from it was used for drinking and used by the famous Gali Anjaneya temple. Etymology Vrishabhavathi is derived from the Sanskrit word Vrishabha which refers to a bull. The river is believed to originate at the feet of the monolithic Nandi statue at the Big Bull Temple in Basavanagudi, hence giving it the name Vrishabhavathi. Course The origin of the river is near the Dakshinamukha Nandi Tirtha or the Kadu Malleshwara Temple in Malleswaram, and it flows through major areas like Nayandahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Kengeri. The river can be seen near the Mantri Mall Malleswaram, Magadi Road and Mysore Road metro stations. The river culminates in a reservoir named after itself Vrishabhavathi Reservoir near Bidadi. It joins Arkavathy River near Kanakapura as a tributary. The river has a basin area of 383 sq. km and passes through 96 out of the 198 wards in Bangalore. A smaller stream of the river originates near Bugle Rock in Basavanagudi, and joins the main river near Mysore Road.  Religious Significance  There are several temples throughout the course of the river. Some of the well-known temples along the banks on the Vrishabhavathi are Dodda Ganesha and the Dodda Basava Temple, Gali Hanumantha Temple, Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple and the Kadu Malleshwara Temple. The Gali Hanumantha Temple is over 600 years old, constructed in 1425 by Sri Vyasaraya of Channapattana who was a Rajaguru of Vijayanagara Empire. The temple was constructed on the confluence of two rivers – Vrishabhavathi and Paschimavahini. The Ishwara Temple at Kengeri dates back to 1050 AD.  Pollution and current concerns  The river is highly polluted due to pollutants from industrial, agricultural and domestic sources. It is said to be dark, smelly and frothy due to \\"untreated or badly treated domestic sewage that goes into the river.\\" In 2005, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, Dharam Singh proposed to remodel the river valley to include widening of the river, and adopt measures to prevent inundation.

Originally from the state of New York, he came to Colorado following the Pike's Peak Gold Rush to try his hand at mining. He traveled to Europe to investigate ways to smelt ore and developed processes to make mining more profitable. He was the mayor of Denver before becoming a United States Senator. Early life Born in Montgomery, Orange County, New York, at the Nathaniel Hill Brick House (now a museum). He was a descendant of Thomas Hale, one of the first settlers in Newbury from England in 1635. Hill took over the family farm in Montgomery, until he was 21, while his eldest brother, James King, attended Yale University. During this time he was a part-time student at Montgomery Academy. He graduated from Brown University in 1856. Career =Educator= He was an instructor and later professor of chemistry at Brown University from 1856 to 1864. He was the first to bring the idea of laboratories to Brown, which he copied from other schools, mostly in Europe. =Mining= His scientific eligibility led him to be invited by cotton manufacturer Colonel William Reynolds to search for mining areas in the West. The greater salary enticed him to journey West. Hill traveled to Colorado in the spring of 1864 to investigate mineral resources. In his search, he traveled alone and with fellow scientists and entrepreneurs. He returned home to Providence after having accomplished little, where he officially resigned from his teaching position and vowed to devote the rest of his life to the search for gold. Upon his return to the West, he bought several gold mines, but soon ran into financial difficulties because the smelting techniques at the time were resulting in low yields. The Sterling Gold Mining Company and the Hill Gold Mining Company were established around Central City in Colorado. The preferred method of extraction in those days was stamp milling. A stamp mill consisted of heavy iron blocks attached to wooden or steel rods that rose and fell in accordance with a horizontal beam. After the ore containing the gold was crushed sufficiently, the resulting dust was run over copper plates containing mercury, which formed an alloy from which the gold could be more easily extracted. Once miners got past the upper ore deposits, they found that the lower ores contained large amounts of complex sulfides. As a result, a precipitous drop in the recovery rate of gold occurred. Failed attempts at introducing alternative methods of extracting gold contributed to the tensions and financial turmoil of the West, until Hill popularized the method of smelting. Accordingly, he spent a portion of 1865 and 1866 in Swansea, Wales and Freiberg, Saxony studying metallurgy, and returned to the United States with a perfected method of smelting. Hill learned while abroad, especially in the coal mines, that the best method was that of copper matte. In this method - known as the Swansea process - copper sulfide ore was mixed with gold and silver ore and the copper acted as a vehicle to hold the gold and silver. After returning, he took up a permanent residence in Black Hawk, Colorado. While in Blackhawk, he had the opportunity to work with James E. Lyon, an entrepreneur who he had met on his first trip to Colorado, and who had erected the first real smelter there. However, his findings surpassed those of Lyons'. He capitalized on the experience and with his professional training as a chemist and the knowledge gained in Europe, founded the Boston & Colorado Smelting Company, which encompassed numerous ventures aside from mining. Through the funding of numerous capitalists, Hill worked alongside popular metallurgists to oversee the smelting process and thus rose in wealth and popularity. =Politician= Hill was mayor of Black Hawk in 1871 and a member of the Territorial council in 1872 and 1873. He moved to Denver in 1873 and engaged in smelting and the real estate business, and was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1879, to March 3, 1885. He ran on a platform of Republican ideals and free silver whose interests lay in the establishment of a monopolistic society and the implementation of a federal telegraph system. Hill also warned against the corruption of the American political system by special interests like monopolies. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining (Forty-seventh Congress), Committee on Post Office and Post Roads (Forty-eighth Congress), and was involved in the International Monetary Commission. His defeat by Henry M. Teller in 1885 ended his political career. Nevertheless, he remained politically active in other ways, purchasing The Denver Republican and using it to further the causes he had fought for in the Senate.

Western Avenue extends south as a continuous road to the Dixie Highway at Sibley Boulevard (Illinois Route 83) in Dixmoor, giving the road a total length of . Western Avenue, after turning into Asbury Ave, runs out on the north side at Green Bay Road in Evanston and on the south side at Crete- Monee Road in Crete. However, Western Avenue extends intermittently through the Southland to the Will / Kankakee county border in unincorporated Will Township. Within Chicago's grid street system, Western Avenue is 2400 West, three miles west of State Street (0 East/West). Western Avenue becomes Asbury Avenue at Howard Street at the Chicago/Evanston border and continues north to Isabella Street on the Evanston/Wilmette border. Unlike Pulaski Road, which was originally Crawford Avenue in both the city and suburbs, Western was always the name in the city. Asbury is only used in Evanston. History From 1851 to 1869, Western Avenue delineated the western edge of the city of Chicago. Being at the edge of town, it became a picnic spot, and Riverview Park was built at the intersection of Western and Belmont Avenues. The amusement park remained open from 1904 until 1967. The park's property is now home to the Riverview Plaza shopping center, the Belmont District Chicago Police Station, and DeVry University. Rosehill Cemetery is also located on Western Avenue in the Lincoln Square neighborhood. Transit Western Avenue is serviced by many CTA buses and trains. The street is serviced by the Brown Line, Orange Line, Pink Line, two Western stations on the Blue Line on the O'Hare and Forest Park branches, and twice by Metra's commuter lines. There are three CTA buses that run along Western Avenue. The main bus route along Western Avenue is the \`49 Western\`, which runs 24 hours a day/7 days a week from Berwyn Avenue on the North Side to 79th Street on the South Side. The \`49B North Western\` runs from Howard Street at the city's northern border to Leland Avenue, where it connects to the Brown Line. The \`349 South Western\` bus route, which is operated by Pace, has completely replaced CTA service on the former \`49A South Western\` route. This route runs from 79th Street in Chicago to the Pace Harvey Transportation Center in Harvey, Illinois. Western Avenue is also the location of multiple stations of the Metra commuter rail network, on the BNSF Railway Line at (18th & Western), the Milwaukee District / North Line and Milwaukee District / West Line on Artesian near Grand, with the station of the Rock Island District a few blocks east of Western Ave. in Blue Island. South Side Irish Parade Western Avenue also played host to the South Side Irish Parade. Held yearly on the Sunday before St. Patrick's Day, along Western between 103rd and 115th Street in the Beverly and Morgan Park neighborhoods, it was the city's largest neighborhood parade, drawing hundreds of thousands of revelers annually. The parade was canceled after the 2009 event due to a growing number of public intoxication arrests. There continues to be an annual Irish Festival, to replace the initially family- oriented parade. In 2012, the parade returned. Chicagoland Toys for Tots Motorcycle Parade Since 1979, Western Avenue has been the venue for what is billed as the largest motorcycle parade in the world. On the first Sunday of December, thousands of motorcyclists assemble at the Dan Ryan Woods Forest Preserve at 87th Street and Western Avenue, bringing new, unwrapped toys for donation to the Toys for Tots charity. The parade drives north to deposit toys at Lane Tech at Addison Street, a distance of over fifteen miles.

Life  = Early life = Sophia Gregoria Hayden was born in Santiago, Chile. Her mother, Elezena Fernandez, was from Chile, and her father, George Henry Hayden, was an American dentist from Boston. Hayden had a sister and two brothers. When she was six, she was sent to Jamaica Plain, a suburb of Boston, to live with her paternal grandparents, George and Sophia Hayden, and attended the Hillside School. While attending West Roxbury High School (1883–1886) she found an interest in architecture. After graduation Hayden's family moved to Richmond, Virginia, but she returned to Boston for college. She graduated from MIT in 1890 with a degree in architecture, with honours. A photograph of Sophia Hayden taken in 1888 when she was an architecture student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology = Education = Hayden shared a drafting room with Lois Lilley Howe, a fellow female architect at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Hayden's work was influenced by MIT professor Eugène Létang. After completing her studies Hayden may have had a hard time finding an entry level apprentice position as an architect because she was a woman so she accepted a position as a mechanical drawing teacher at a Boston high school. Woman's Building. World's Columbian Exposition (1892 : Chicago, Ill.). Ground Plan and Gallery Plan of the Woman's Building = Career =  World's Columbian Exposition  She is best known for designing The Woman's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, when she was just 21. The Woman's Building was the nation's most prominent design competition for women at that time. Hayden based her design on her thesis project, \\"Renaissance Museum of Fine Arts,\\" a grand two-story structure with center and end pavilions, multiple arches, columned terraces and other classical features, reflecting her Beaux-Art training. It became a controversial structure as many women objected to having their work in a separate structure. Hayden's entry won first prize out of a field of thirteen entries submitted by trained female architects. She received $1,000 for the design, when some male architects earned $10,000 for similar buildings. During construction, Hayden's design principles were compromised by incessant changes demanded by the construction committee, spearheaded by socialite Bertha Palmer, who eventually fired Hayden from the project. Hayden appeared at the Inaugural Celebration and had published accounts of support by her fellow architects. Her frustration eventually was pointed to as typifying women's unfitness for supervising construction, although many architects sympathized with her position and defended her. In the end the rifts were made up, perhaps, and Hayden's building received an award for \\"Delicacy of style, artistic taste, and geniality and elegance of the interior.\\" Within a year or two, virtually all the Fair buildings were destroyed. Frustrated with the way she had been treated, Hayden may or may not have decided to retire from architecture, but she did not work again as an architect.  Retirement  In 1900, Hayden married a portrait painter and, later, interior designer, William Blackstone Bennett, in Winthrop, Massachusetts. A stepdaughter, Jennie \\"Minnie\\" May Bennett, was from William Blackstone Bennett's prior marriage. The couple had no children. William died of pneumonia on April 11, 1909. Although Hayden designed a memorial for women's clubs in the U.S. in 1894, it was never built. She worked as an artist for years and lived a quiet life in Winthrop, Massachusetts. Hayden died at the Winthrop Convalescent Nursing Home in 1953 of pneumonia after suffering a stroke.

In the diasporic Yoruba spirituality of Latin America, Ibeji are syncretized with Saints Cosmas and Damian. In Yoruba culture and spirituality, twins are believed to be magical, and are granted protection by the Orisha Shango. If one twin should die, it represents bad fortune for the parents and the society to which they belong. The parents therefore commission a babalawo to carve a wooden Ibeji to represent the deceased twin, and the parents take care of the figure as if it were a real person. Other than the sex, the appearance of the Ibeji is determined by the sculptor. The parents then dress and decorate the ibeji to represent their own status, using clothing made from cowrie shells, as well as beads, coins and paint. Ibeji figures are admired by tribal art collectors and many have made their way into western collections. The world's largest collection of Ibejis is at the British Museum, London. The firstborn of the twins is known as Taiwo while the second one is called Kehinde. In Yoruba culture the second twin is considered the elder twin; the reason for this is that Taiwo is sent by Kehinde to judge if the world is fit and beautiful before he/she descends, in accordance with Yoruba belief.

The club was established in South Shields in 1936 as a replacement for the club that had relocated to Gateshead in 1930. Like their predecessor, the club was also relocated to Gateshead in 1974 after the former club went bust. Renamed Gateshead United, they folded three years later. History =South Shields= Following the departure of the original South Shields to Gateshead in 1930, the new club was formed in 1936 following a public meeting at the Ocean Road Congregational Church Hall organised by the Shields Gazette.History South Shields F.C. The club was admitted to the North Eastern League for the 1936–37 season.North Eastern League 1933–1964 Non- League Matters They finished third in their first season, before winning the league in 1938–39. After World War II they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in 1947–48, losing 4–1 at Crewe Alexandra. In the preliminary qualifying round match against Radcliffe Welfare United, Chris Marron scored 10 goals in a 13–0 win, an FA Cup record. The following season saw them finish as runners-up, a feat they repeated in 1955–56 and 1956–57. The latter season also saw another FA Cup first round appearance, resulting in 4–0 defeat at Chesterfield in a replay. In the following season the club reached the second round of the FA Cup, beating Frickley Colliery in the first round, before losing 3–1 to York City in the second round. They went on to win the league that season, after which the club applied for election to the Fourth Division of the Football League, but received only one vote.Dave Twydell (2001) Denied F.C.: The Football League election struggles Yore Publications, p19 The North Eastern League folded in 1958, after which South Shields became members of the Midland League. In 1958–59 the club reached the second round of the FA Cup again after thrashing Fourth Division Crewe 5–0 in a replay, before losing 2–0 at Oldham in the next round. Another second round appearance followed the next season, with a 2–1 win over Third Division Chesterfield in the first round setting up a second round tie with Bradford Park Avenue, which saw them lose 5–1. Both of their seasons in the Midland League saw the club apply for Football League membership again, but they received only a single vote on each occasion.Twydell, p20 In 1960 the Midland League also folded, and the club became members of the new Northern Counties League, effectively a reformed North Eastern League; they were joined by Gateshead, who had been voted out of the Football League. Another attempt at gaining Football League membership in 1961 saw them receive their customary one vote. The 1961–62 season saw them finish as league runners-up and win the League Cup, but in the Football League elections they failed to any votes. The league was renamed the North Eastern League in 1962 and the club finished as runners-up again in 1962–63, receiving a single vote again in the Football League elections. At the end of the 1963–64 season, which had seen the club finish second for a third consecutive season (and two votes in the Football League elections), the league was disbanded. South Shields subsequently became members of the North Regional League, which was largely composed of reserve teams of Football League clubs. Further attempts to gain election to the Football League saw them gain one vote in 1965 and three in 1966, which marked their final attempt.Twydell, p21 They were North Regional League champions in 1966–67, and in 1968 the club became a founder member of the Northern Premier League. Although they had made regular appearances in the first round of the FA Cup throughout the 1960s, the 1969–70 season saw the club achieve their best-ever run. After beating Fourth Division clubs Bradford Park Avenue and Oldham in the first and second round, they were drawn away to Second Division QPR in the third round, losing 4–1. In 1972 they applied for membership of the Scottish Second Division (along with Wigan Athletic) but were rejected.The Scottish play When Saturday Comes, February 2012 The 1973–74 season saw the club reach the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, eventually losing 3–0 on aggregate to Morecambe, despite having beaten them 6–0 and 7–1 in the league earlier in the season. At the end of the 1973–74 season South Shields were made homeless after selling their Simonside Hall ground and being prevented from moving back to Horsley Hill. Repeating what had happened in 1930, the club relocated to Gateshead and were renamed Gateshead United. Another attempt was made to join the Scottish league, but they were rejected again, losing out to Ferranti Thistle. =Gateshead United= In its first season under the new name, the club finished seventh in the Northern Premier League and reached the second round of the FA Cup, defeating Crewe in the first round, before losing 3–0 at Altrincham. Another second round appearance the following season ended with a 3–1 defeat at Rochdale after the club had won 3–1 at Grimsby Town in the first round. However, at the end of the 1976–77 season the club disbanded and was replaced by another new Gateshead club. Ground The club originally played at Horsley Hill, the former grounds of the original South Shields. However, a dispute with the stadium owners led to them leaving in 1950 to move to a new ground at Simonside Hall. With support from the 13,000-strong supporters' club, two new stands were built and floodlights installed. The supporters' club bought the ground in the 1950s to ensure it could be used by the club in perpetuity. The ground's record attendance was 20,500, and there were plans to create a 35,000 capacity stadium. The supporters' club was later disbanded and ownership of the ground passed to the football club's directors. In the 1970s the ground was sold with the intent to move back to Horsley Hill. However, a deal had not been finalised to buy Horsley Hill before Simonside Hall was sold, leaving the club was left homeless. When the club relocated to Gateshead, they played at the Gateshead Youth Stadium. Colours Upon the reformation in 1936, South Shields played in Red and Green quartered shirts, colours going back to the town's early football league days in the 1920s. In the 1960s however, the club reverted to all white with Blue trim. Come the end of the decade Shields were then seen playing in Amber shirts and Blue shorts, these colours were worn at their FA Cup 3rd Round tie at QPR in 1970. At some point in the 1970s Shields had reverted to an all red kit until their departure from Simonside Hall. For their existence as Gateshead United, they adopted home colours of White and Green.

It is located near the border with Algeria about 5 km north from the modern town of Fériana and 30 km south-west of the provincial capital Kasserine.  History  The Roman city held the rank of colonia. An important network of roads branched out from it, linking it with Cilium and Theveste to the north, and Gafsa and Gabès to the south. In the 6th century it became the residence of the military governor of Byzacena. Procopius (De Ædificiis, VI, 6) says that the city was fortified by Justinian.Byzantine fortifications from the fifth to the tenth century  Bishopric  We have the names of several bishops of Thelepte. Julianus was present at the Council of Carthage (256) that Cyprian called to consider the question of the lapsi; Donatianus, who assisted at the joint Council of Carthage (411) between Catholic and Donatist bishops and at a council in Carthage in 416 called by Saint Aurelius and at another in Milevum in the same year; he himself as senior bishop of the province held a council of the bishops of Byzacena in 418 either at Thelepte or at Zella (the manuscripts do not agree). Frumentius was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484 and then exiled.

It is one of the oldest continuously-published college weeklies in the United States and claims to be the oldest co-ed college weekly in the nation. Circulation Approximately 1,900 copies of The Student are printed every week and distributed to hundreds of alumni, parents, and other friends of the College. The paper is published each Wednesday while classes are in session and can be found in distribution boxes located in Common, Ladd Library, Pettingill Hall, the Den and Post and Print.

Once a year, usually at the end of the year, The Student runs a spoof edition commonly known as the \\"Bates Spudent.\\" History The Bates Student was founded as a combination of the college's newspaper and literary magazine and as a successor to earlier publications such as the Seminary Advocate (1855–1863) and College Courant (ca. 1864-1872).Bates College The Bates Student was founded in 1873 in the years following the Civil War. It describes itself as \\"the nation's oldest continuously co-ed college weekly,\\" although this assertion has been contested.Ibid. & \\"About the Bates Student,\\" Bates Student website Since many college newspapers were founded around the same time, there have been competing claims for which one was the oldest or the first in the United States. For example, The Bowdoin Orient, founded two years earlier in 1871, claims to be the \\"oldest continuously-published college weekly\\", but Bowdoin was an all-male school; the Yale Daily News claims to be the \\"oldest college daily\\"; the Harvard Crimson, also founded in 1873, claims to \\"the nation's oldest continuously published daily college newspaper\\"; The Dartmouth began in 1843 as a monthly and tries to claim institutional continuity with a local eighteenth-century paper called the Dartmouth Gazette. Accordingly, The Bates Student has claimed that it is the oldest continuously-published weekly newspaper from a co-educational college. In the late 19th century, the paper was published on a bi-weekly basis, and in the early 20th century, it was published on a weekly basis.Anthony, Alfred Williams, Bates College and Its Background, (Philadelphia: Judson Press, 1936). It has been published continuously and without interruption during each academic year since 1873. Among its earliest editors and writers in the 1870s were African Americans and women.(Bates College Thesis 2005)Timothy Larson, \\"Faith By Their Works,\\" Thesis website The paper's was originally formatted in a smaller literary magazine layout and included literary works such as poems and fiction alongside news reports. In 1879, the literary society formed a separate publication called The Garnet, and thereafter The Student focused primarily on news. In the early twentieth century, the paper abandoned the smaller literary magazine format and adopted a larger broadsheet layout. Archives are kept at the offices of The Bates Student (with issues dating back to 1873) as well as the college's library, with its Edmund S. Muskie Archives and Special Collection Library, which has a nearly complete archive of past issues in print form. The library also has issues of the Seminary Advocate and College Courant dating back to the 1850s and 1860s.Bates College Generally the newspaper has been the primary newspaper for the college, although it had some competition when The John Galt Press was being published at Bates.

Overview Referer spoofing is typically done for data privacy reasons, in testing, or in order to request information (without genuine authority) which some web servers may only supply in response to requests with specific HTTP referers. To improve their privacy, individual browser users may replace accurate referer data with inaccurate data, though many simply suppress their browser's sending of any referer data. Sending no referrer information is not technically spoofing, though sometimes also described as such. In software, systems and networks testing, and sometimes penetration testing, referer spoofing is often just part of a larger procedure of transmitting both accurate and inaccurate as well as expected and unexpected input to the HTTPD system being tested and observing the results. While many web sites are configured to gather referer information and serve different content depending on the referer information obtained, exclusively relying on HTTP referer information for authentication and authorization purposes is not a genuine computer security measure. HTTP referer information is freely alterable and interceptable, and is not a password, though some poorly configured systems treat it as such. Application Some websites, especially many image hosting sites, use referer information to secure their materials: only browsers arriving from their web pages are served images. Additionally a site may want users to click through pages with advertisements before directly being able to access a downloadable file — using the referring page or referring site information can help a site redirect unauthorized users to the landing page the site would like to use. If attackers acquire knowledge of these approved referers, which is often trivial because many sites follow a common template, they can use that information combined with this to exploit and gain access to the materials. Spoofing often allows access to a site's content where the site's web server is configured to block browsers that do not send referer headers. Website owners may do this to disallow hotlinking. It can also be used to defeat referer checking controls that are used to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Tools Several software tools exist to facilitate referer spoofing in web browsers. Some are extensions to popular browsers such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, which may provide facilities to customise and manage referrer URLs for each website the user visits. Other tools include proxy servers, to which an individual configures their browser to send all HTTP requests. The proxy then forwards different headers to the intended website, usually removing or modifying the referer header. Such proxies may also present privacy issues for users, as they may log the user's activity.

The 80-acre site lies near the Arkansas River, seven miles north of the town of Spiro. Between the 9th and 15th centuries, the local indigenous people created a powerful religious and political center, culturally linked to the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, also called the Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere (MIIS). Spiro was a major western outpost of Mississippian culture, which dominated the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries for centuries. Spiro Mounds is under the protection of the Oklahoma Historical Society and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Spiro Mounds.\\" Oklahoma Historical Society. (retrieved 30 May 2011) In the 1930s during the Great Depression, treasure hunters bought the rights to tunnel into Craig Mound—the second-largest mound on the site—to mine it for artifacts. They exposed a hollow burial chamber inside the mound, a unique feature containing some of the most extraordinary pre-Columbian artifacts ever found in the United States. These included works of fragile, perishable materials: textiles and feathers that had been uniquely preserved in the conditions of the closed chamber. The treasure hunters sold the artifacts they recovered to art collectors, some as far away as Europe. Some of these artifacts were later returned to regional museums and the Caddo Nation, but other artifacts have never been accounted for. This site has been significant for North American archaeology since the 1930s, especially due to its many preserved textiles and wealth of shell carving. Chronology The history of Spiro is typically divided into archaeological phases: * Evans Phase (900–1050 CE) * Harlan Phase (1050–1250 CE) * Norman Phase (1250–1350 CE) * Spiro phase (1350–1450 CE) Residential construction at Spiro decreased dramatically around 1250, and people settled in nearby villages, such as the Choates-Holt Site to the north. Spiro was used as a ceremonial and mortuary center through 1450.”Caddo Fundamentals: Spiro and the Arkansas Basin.” accessed 30 May 2011 The mound area was abandoned about 1450, although nearby communities persisted until 1600. The cultures following in the wake of Spiro were less complex and hierarchical.Rogers, J. Daniel \\"Chronology and the Demise of Chiefdoms: Eastern Oklahoma in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.\\" Southeastern Archaeology, 25 (1), Retrieved 2 Sep 2008 from Research Library database. (Document ID: 1158326791) Mounds and plaza area A reconstructed house. Grass-thatched roofs were typical of the later, historic Wichita and Caddo, but their houses were round with high-pitched roofs. Mississippian culture spread along the lower Mississippi River and its tributaries between the 9th and 16th centuries. The largest Mississippian settlement was Cahokia, the capital of a major chiefdom that built a six-mile-square city east of what is now St. Louis, Missouri in present-day Southern Illinois. Mississippian culture ranged from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, and along the Ohio River and into both the lowland and mountain areas of the Southeast. Mississippian settlements were known for their large platform earthwork mounds (usually truncated pyramids) surmounted by temples, the houses of warrior kings and priests, and the burial houses of the elite. The mounds were arranged around large, flat plazas believed to be used for ceremonial community gathering and ritual games. Archaeological research has shown that Mississippian settlements such as Cahokia and Spiro took part in a vast trading network that covered the eastern half of what is now the U.S. and parts of what is now the Western U.S. as well. The Spiro site includes twelve earthen mounds and 150 acres of land. As in other Mississippian-culture towns, the people built a number of large, complex earthworks. These included mounds surrounding a large, planned and leveled central plaza, where important religious rituals, the politically and culturally significant game of chunkey, and other important community activities were carried out. The population lived in a village that bordered the plaza. In addition, archaeologists have found more than twenty related village sites within five miles of the main town. Other village sites linked to Spiro through culture and trade have been found up to a away. Spiro has been the site of human activity for at least 8000 years. It was a major Mississippian settlement from 800 to 1450. The cultivation of maize allowed accumulation of crop surpluses and the gathering of more dense populations. It was the headquarters town of a regional chiefdom, whose powerful leaders directed the building of eleven platform mounds and one burial mound in an area on the south bank of the Arkansas River. The heart of the site is a group of nine mounds surrounding an oval plaza. These mounds were the bases of the homes of important leaders or formed the foundations for religious structures that focused the attention of the community. Brown Mound, the largest platform mound, is located on the eastern side of the plaza. It had an earthen ramp that gave access to the summit from the north side. Here, atop Brown Mound and the other mounds, the town's inhabitants carried out complex rituals, centered especially on the deaths and burials of Spiro's powerful rulers. Archaeologists have shown that Spiro had a large resident population until about 1250. After that, most of the population moved to other towns nearby. Spiro continued to be used as a regional ceremonial center and burial ground until about 1450. Its ceremonial and mortuary functions continued and seem to have increased after the main population moved away. The Great Mortuary Craig Mound Craig Mound – also called \\"The Spiro Mound\\" – is the second-largest mound on the site and the only burial mound. It is located about southeast of the plaza. A cavity created within the mound, about high and wide, allowed for almost perfect preservation of fragile artifacts made of wood, conch shell, and copper. The conditions in this hollow space were so favorable that objects made of perishable materials such as basketry, woven fabric of vegetal and animal fibers, lace, fur, and feathers were preserved inside it. In historic tribes, such objects have traditionally been created by women. Also found inside were several examples of Mississippian stone statuary made from Missouri flint clay and Mill Creek chert bifaces, all thought to have originally come from the Cahokia site in Illinois. The \\"Great Mortuary,\\" as archaeologists called this hollow chamber, appears to have begun as a burial structure for Spiro's rulers. It was created as a circle of sacred cedar posts sunk in the ground and angled together at the top like a tipi. The cone-shaped chamber was covered with layers of earth to create the mound, and it never collapsed. Some scholars believe that minerals percolating through the mound hardened the chamber's log walls, making them resistant to decay and shielding the perishable artifacts inside from direct contact with the earth. No other Mississippian mound has been found with such a hollow space inside it and with such spectacular preservation of artifacts. Craig Mound has been called \\"an American King Tut's Tomb.\\" Between 1933 and 1935, Craig Mound was excavated by an enterprise that had bought the rights from local landowners to excavate and to keep or sell the artifacts they recovered. Tunneling into the mound and breaking through the Great Mortuary's log wall, they found many human burials, together with their associated grave goods. They discarded the human remains and the fragile artifacts—made of textile, basketry, and even feathers—that were preserved in these extremely unusual conditions. Most of these rare and historically priceless objects disintegrated before scholars could reach the site, although some were sold to collectors. When the commercial excavators finished, they dynamited the burial chamber and sold the commercially valuable artifacts, made of stone, pottery, copper, and conch shell, to collectors in the United States and overseas. Most of these valuable objects are probably lost, but some have been returned through donation and documented by scholars.

The Oklahoma Historical Society established the Spiro Mounds Archaeological Center in 1978 that continues to operate. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is preserved as Oklahoma's only Archeological State Park and only pre-contact Native American site open to the public. Southeastern Ceremonial Complex Anthropomorphic human headed avian plate from Spiro Spiro Mounds people participated in what archaeologists call the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC), a network of ceremonial centers sharing the Mississippian culture and similar spiritual beliefs, cosmology, ritual practices, and cult objects. The SECC was a vast trading network that distributed exotic materials for making ritual objects from all across North America. These included colored flint from New Mexico, copper from the Great Lakes, conch (or lightning whelk) shells from the Gulf Coast, and mica from the Carolinas. Other Mississippian centers also traded in these prized resources, but Spiro was apparently the only one that acquired obsidian from Mexico. Using these valued materials, Mississippian artists created exquisite works of art reflecting their cultural identity and their complex spiritual beliefs. When commercial excavators dug into Craig Mound in the 1930s, they found many beautifully crafted ritual artifacts, including stone effigy pipes, polished stone maces, finely made flint knives and arrowpoints, polished chunkey stones, copper effigy axes, Mississippian copper plates (Spiro plates), mica effigy cut outs, elaborately engraved conch shell ornaments, pearl bead necklaces, stone earspools, wood carvings inlaid with shell, and specially made mortuary pottery. The conch shells were fashioned into gorgets and drinking cups engraved with intricate designs representing costumed men, real and mythical animals, and geometric motifs, all of which had profound symbolic significance. Spiro Mounds' ceremonial objects are among the finest examples of pre-Columbian art in North America. Later, archaeologists recognized that the ritual artifacts at Spiro were similar to comparable objects excavated at other powerful Mississippian towns that also participated in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These include Cahokia in Illinois, the largest Mississippian town; Etowah and Ocmulgee in Georgia; and Moundville in Alabama. In economic terms, Spiro seems to have been a gateway town that funneled valuable resources from the Great Plains and other western regions to the main Mississippian ceremonial centers farther east. In return, it received valuable goods from those other centers. Spiro's location on the Arkansas River, one of the Mississippi's principal tributaries, gave it access to the Mississippian heartland. Spiro and other Mississippian towns clearly looked to the great city of Cahokia, in what is now southern Illinois, as a cultural model to be emulated. Located about 400 miles northeast of Spiro near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, Cahokia was the largest and most impressive of all the Mississippian towns. Mineralogical analysis of some of the most beautiful stone effigy pipes found at Spiro, including the famous \\"Grizzly Man\\" or \\"Kneeling Rattler\\" pipe, have shown they came from Cahokia, based on the material from which they were made. Cahokia also influenced the styles of the artifacts made at Spiro. Archaeologists have identified four distinct styles: the Braden Style characteristic of artifacts brought from Cahokia; and the Craig A, B, and C styles, which are local derivatives of the Braden Style. Antonio Waring and Preston Holder first defined the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex in the 1940s, according to a series of distinct cultural traits. Since the late 1980s, archaeologists have adopted a new classification scheme based on their greatly improved understanding of Mississippian cultural development. The new scheme divides the SECC into five periods, or horizons, each defined by the appearance of new ritual objects and cultural motifs connected with new developments in politics and long-distance trade. Archaeologists have determined that Spiro was at the peak of its cultural importance in the 13th and 14th centuries. Mississippian iconography Engraved shell gorget from Spiro Mounds. The striped-center-pole, or axis mundi, divides the image in half. The cross and circle motifs also have symbolic meanings. Spiro Mounds shell gorget with spider motif, at Woolaroc Museum Archaeologists have tried in recent years to interpret the meaning of the ritual artifacts and artistic imagery found at Spiro and other Mississippian sites. While reaching firm conclusions about the meanings of works of art made centuries ago by people of an extinct culture is difficult, archaeologists have made some compelling interpretations by comparing Mississippian artistic imagery with the myths, religious rituals, art, and iconography of historic Native American groups. One of the most prominent symbols at Spiro is the \\"Birdman,\\" a winged human figure representing a warrior or chunkey player. Chunkey was a game played in the Mississippian period, but also in historic times by the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, and other tribes throughout the Eastern Woodlands. Men played the game by rolling a stone disk for a considerable distance and then hurling spears as close as they could to the point where the stone stopped. Another Spiro icon is the \\"Great Serpent,\\" a being said to inhabit the Under World, the spiritual domain on the opposite side of the Mississippian universe. The Great Serpent is portrayed in Mississippian art with a serpent's body but also with wings or horns. Similar beings were the subject of myth in historic times among the Micmac, Huron, Kickapoo, Cherokee, Muscogee Creek, Caddo, and other Native American tribes, appearing in tribes of at least three major language families. The spiritual beings of the Under World were thought to be in constant opposition to those in the Upper World. Men had to fear these beings, according to Native American mythology, but they could also gain great power from them in certain circumstances. Mississippian art also features the cedar tree or striped-center-pole motifs, which archaeologists have interpreted as the axis mundi, the point at which the three parts of the Mississippian spiritual universe come together: the Upper World, the Under World, and the Middle World where humans dwell. The cedar tree or the striped-center-pole is often found on engraved conch shell gorgets, with human or animal figures positioned on either side. The concept of an axis mundi — the point where different cosmic domains converge — is found in many cultures around the world. It is frequently represented as a tree (including the Tree of Life), since trees pass through the surface of the earth and connect the subsurface and the sky. The fact that the Great Mortuary at Spiro was built with cedar (or cedar elm) posts suggests that the burial chamber was meant to be a point of departure from one spiritual domain to another, as cedar was a sacred wood. Archaeologists found that one of the conch shell cups from Craig Mound had a black residue in the bottom. This suggests that the Spiro people may have practiced a version of the Black Drink Ceremony, a purification ritual that was also performed in historic times by their descendants - the Southeastern tribes. Participants drank a tea made from the Yaupon Holly from conch shell cups. Caddoan Mississippians Map of the Caddoan Mississippian culture and some important sites Most authorities agree that the people of Spiro were Caddoan speaking, but their descendants in historic times are difficult to identify. Archaeologists speculate that the Caddo Confederacy, Wichita, Kichai, or non-Caddoan Tunica could be their descendants. However, the cultures of all these peoples, when encountered by the Spanish and French in the 16th and 17th centuries, were substantially different from that of Spiro.\\"Caddo Fundamentals: Spiro and the Arkansas Basin.\\" accessed 30 May 2011 Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco and Tawakonie) are recognized by the US Federal government and archaeologists as the cultural descendants of the builders of Spiro Mounds.\\"Notice of Inventory Completion: Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.\\" Federal Registrar. 29 May 2008 (retrieved 30 May 2011) When the Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto led an expedition into what is now the Southeastern United States in the 1540s, he encountered Native American groups including the Tula people, who lived near the Arkansas River. The De Soto Expedition also encountered numerous Caddo villages. Composed of many tribes, the Caddo were organized into three confederacies, the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches, which were all linked by similar languages. At the time of de Soto's visit, the Caddoan peoples occupied a large territory. It included what is now Eastern Oklahoma, Western Arkansas, Northeast Texas, and Northwest Louisiana. Archaeologists have thought that the Caddo and related peoples had been living in the region for centuries and that they had their own local variant of Mississippian culture. Recent excavations have revealed within that region more cultural diversity than scholars had expected. The sites along the Arkansas River, in particular, seem to have their own distinctive characteristics. Scholars still classify the Mississippian sites found in the entire Caddo area, including Spiro Mounds, as \\"Caddoan Mississippian\\". The Caddoan Mississippian region contained many towns in addition to Spiro, including the Battle Mound Site. Scholars have determined that Battle Mound, lying along the Great Bend of the Red River in Southwest Arkansas, was a larger site than Spiro. Little excavation has been done there to date. The Caddoan Mississippian towns had a more irregular layout of earthen mounds and associated villages than did towns in the Middle Mississippian heartland to the east. They also lacked the wooden palisade fortifications often found in the major Middle Mississippian towns. Living on the western edge of the Mississippian world, the Caddoan may have faced fewer military threats from their neighbors. Their societies may also have had a somewhat lower level of social stratification. The Spiro people were probably speakers of one of the many Caddoan languages. The Caddoan languages once had a broad geographic distribution, but many are now extinct. The modern languages in the Caddoan family include Caddo, Wichita, Kitsai, Pawnee, and Arikara languages. Wichita and Kitsai are both extinct. Museum complex The Spiro Mounds are located within the Spiro Mounds Archaeological Center complex in Fort Coffee, Oklahoma.

The widest use of the term refers to a device that holds sheet film for use in large format cameras, but it can also refer to various interchangeable devices in medium format or even 135 film camera systems.  Sheet film holders  Graflex 4×5 Sheet Film Holders. The most common instance of film holder is the sheet film holder. Also referred to as a dark slide or double dark slide, they are flat devices, slightly larger than the films they hold, which commonly hold one sheet of film on each side. The plate holder, which is a very similar device, holds glass plates instead of sheet film. A dark slide, from which the device derives its alternate name, is simply a dark cover that slides into a recess in the holder to protect the film (or plate) from exposure to light. Many dark slides have differently colored bands or handles on each side, one usually light and the other dark, so the photographer can distinguish between exposed and unexposed film. Traditionally, sheet film and glass plate holders have been made out of wood. Wooden holders, properly treated, can last a very long time, and apart from possible warpage, many very old specimens are still in service. Some companies continue to make wood models today, particularly for more uncommon film sizes, and as many are mostly handmade, they can be quite expensive. The majority of new sheet film holders are now made out of plastic. When using a sheet film holder, the device is inserted into the camera, often a view camera, and the dark slide is withdrawn, making the film available for exposure. After the exposure has been made, the dark slide is reinserted into the film holder, and the device is removed from the camera for later processing of the exposed film. = Multi-sheet holders = Grafmatic \\"45\\" Film Holder. Some film holders can hold more than two sheets. One of the most common is the Grafmatic, manufactured by Graflex, which holds six sheets of film in individual septums. They were available in \\"23\\" and \\"45\\" models, corresponding to 6×9 cm (2¼×3¼ inches) and 4×5 inch sheets. It takes little effort to quickly cycle through all six sheets, which makes the Grafmatic ideal for press camera usage. Burke & James produced a similar device called the Kinematic, which holds 10 sheets, though was only available in 4×5 inch format. Graflex also produced the Film Magazine. It is commonly referred to as a \\"bag magazine\\" (or \\"bag mag\\"), and uses a leather bag that hangs on the side of the frame to exchange the septums from front to back. It is a much more manual device than the Grafmatic, as exchanging a septum is done manually through the bag, rather than by a simple manipulation of the magazine's dark slide. They were sold in separate versions for film and glass plates, and held 12-18 sheets/plates, depending on the model. They are found in 3×4, 4×5, and 5×7 inch formats. Though all are superficially similar (a \\"bag mag\\" film (not plate) septum is the same thickness as a Grafmatic septum, but has slightly different width and length; a Kinematic septum appears almost identical to a Grafmatic septum but is in fact considerably thinner) in fact use of a septum from a different type of holder in any of these multi-sheet holders is very likely to jam the entire magazine and bend internal parts, which can then damage yet another holder if used with it. As replacement parts are no longer available one must be careful not to interchange pieces of different types of multi-sheet holders. Fuji created a 4×5 system in the late 1990s called QuickChange, which is somewhat similar to a Grafmatic in principle. It is made of plastic rather than metal, making it lighter, and less prone to bent septums, but also less durable. It can hold 8 shots, and inserts are purchased already loaded with film. Though not sold as such, these inserts can be reloaded a limited number of times with standard sheet film. Because, like Grafmatic or \\"bag mag\\" holders, the Fuji holders used sheet film of normal thickness, they offered higher image quality than the older \\"film packs\\" (see below), but never became widely popular before digital imaging brought much production of traditional large-format materials to a halt. = Film pack holders = Graflex and Polaroid produced film pack holders that could be loaded in subdued light. Film packs were available from various film manufacturers in 12 and 16-sheet units. The classic film pack consisted of several \\"sheets\\" of film (actually much thinner than standard sheet film, as they were cut from large-format roll film, for economy and physical flexibility) taped together and wound in a series of S-bends around a metal frame. To \\"advance\\" the film, the user pulled a paper tab that protruded from the side of the film pack. The tab was attached—facing the opposite direction—to the junction of each sheet and its intervening section of tape. The thin film and only slight tension this system provided resulted in poor film flatness, and negatives are often sharp enough only for contact printing. They were primarily used by press photographers, and demand fell off dramatically as photojournalists converted to roll film cameras. According to former Kodak employees at the Eastman House photographic museum, Kodak stopped producing film packs when the last employee trained to assemble them (which required working with the very sharp metal frame in total darkness) retired in the 1980s. This rendered all traditional film pack holders in the world obsolete at once. Polaroid film packs, though mechanically similar, are not (and never were) available in standard film sizes. The Fuji QuickChange system was sometimes referred to as a film pack system but, as noted above, was a mechanical multi-sheet holder. = Instant film holders = Polaroid produced the widest range of instant sheet and pack film, but discontinued all production in 2008, leaving Fujifilm as the only producer of instant film and backs. The Polaroid 545, the lighter and more modern 545i, and the 545 Pro backs were 4×5 inch instant sheet film holders that many photographers used. New55 Holdings, LLC started producing a black and white P/N film for the 545 and 545i backs. This new instant sheet film produces a black and white negative and a positive image. The older Polaroid 550 packfilm back can take Fuji FP-100C film (3.25x4.25 inches), which was the last product of this type and was discontinued in February 2016. Polaroid also produced 8×10 inch film holders and films. Polaroid produced 10-sheet 4×5 inch instant film packs and holders. =Preloaded systems= Some 4×5 inch films come in light-tight envelopes that can be loaded into a special holder in daylight. The envelopes are much smaller and lighter than a dark-slide loaded with film, so a photographer can carry a larger quantity of film than the same amount of film in dark-slides. Fuji Quickload TM film and holders, and Kodak Readyload TM film and holders, are of this type. These have not been manufactured for several years, although old stock may sometimes be sold online. New55 Holdings, LLC has started producing a variety of Ready Loads called 1SHOT TM for the preloaded systems, these include Black and white negative, color negative and color slide films. =Rollfilm holders= Film holders that adapt rollfilm to sheet film cameras are usually called film backs. Film backs for 4×5 inch cameras are particularly common--there is little point in taking 6×9 cm pictures on a camera. Horseman, Linhof, Graflex, and other manufacturers have made roll film holders in 6×7, 6×8, 6×9, 6×12, and 6×17 cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal sheet film holder, while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the roll holder.  Medium format film holders  Film holders are available as accessories for some medium format cameras. The most usual case is the Polaroid back taking instant film, often used to check exposure values, color rendition, etc. before taking final photographs on conventional film. Several of the types of holders made for large format film, including darkslide sheet holders, Grafmatic multi-sheet holders, the Graflex bag mag, and film packs were also manufactured in medium format sizes, almost always 2\\"×3\\" (6×9 cm). Press camera manufacturers often produced smaller versions of their 4×5 cameras in this size, often called \\"23\\", and while later versions of these cameras could use rollfilm adaptors, these were not widely available until almost 1950, and were expensive in their first years of production. Sheet film or glass plate holders for medium format rollfilm cameras can be found, but are of mainly historical interest. Some rollfilm cameras have interchangeable backs to accommodate different film types. Some 35mm cameras have motorised backs that hold longer than normal film lengths, with a mechanism that automatically advances the film after each exposure.

It is one of the longest north–south streets in Los Angeles city and county, apart from Sepulveda Boulevard. It is about long. The avenue is known for prostitution, primarily between Melrose Avenue and 2nd Street. Description Western Avenue passes through a large diversity of residential neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. From the south, where it transitions into Paseo Del Mar near White Point and the Pacific Ocean, it begins in San Pedro, then passes through Rancho Palos Verdes, Harbor City, Gardena and South Los Angeles. It is also the easternmost border of Torrance. Around the Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, and Wilshire Boulevard intersections, Western Avenue passes through Koreatown. Further north, Western Avenue passes through the East Hollywood district. Around the Santa Monica Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, and Hollywood Boulevard intersections, it passes through the East Hollywood neighborhoods of Little Armenia and Thai Town. The northern terminus of Western is north of Franklin Avenue in the Los Feliz district, at the base of the Hollywood Hills. The road curves east becoming Los Feliz Boulevard, a major east/west thoroughfare through Los Feliz to the Golden State Freeway and from there into the city of Glendale. Another Western Avenue begins north of Griffith Park and is located in the San Fernando Valley area of Glendale. Its southwest terminus is nearly due north of where Los Angeles' Western Avenue transitions into Los Feliz Boulevard. California State Route 213 is designated as the portion of Western Avenue from Interstate 405 to 25th Street, in San Pedro. California State Route 258 is designated as the portion of Western Avenue from Interstate 405 to the Hollywood Freeway US 101.

Plot summary Pippin IV explores the life of Pippin Héristal, an amateur astronomer in 1950s France, who is suddenly proclaimed the King of France. Unknowingly appointed to give the Communists a monarchy to revolt against, Pippin is chosen because he was descended from the famous king Charlemagne. Unhappy with his lack of privacy, alteration of family life, uncomfortable housings at the Palace of Versailles and his lack of power as a constitutional monarch, the protagonist spends a portion of the novel dressing up as a commoner, often riding a motorscooter, to avoid the constrained life of a king. Pippin eventually receives his wish of dethronement after the people of France enact the rebellion Pippin's kingship was destined to receive. He returns to his home in Paris to find that nothing has really changed. Characters * Pippin Arnulf Héristal - protagonist of the story; he is an amateur astronomer whose bloodline traces back to King Pippin II and to Charlemagne. He later becomes the King of France. * Marie, Pippin's wife - a practical, buxom woman who becomes Queen of France in a down-to-earth fashion. She likens managing the kingdom to managing a home. * Clotilde, Pippin's daughter - a best-selling author, inspiration for a religious movement, intellectual prodigy, and Crown Princess, all by the age of twenty. She is a stereotypical youth, clumsy and frivolous. * Charles Martel - Pippin's uncle, an art and antique dealer who shares a name with the historical figure, an ancient member of his family. He often advises Pippin on tough situations. * Sister Hyacinthe (née Suzanne Lescault) - a former cabaret performer-turned-nun who provides sage advice to Marie and Pippin. * Tod Johnson - a young American traveling in Europe who becomes involved with Clotilde; heir to a large fortune from his father, H.

El Marsa El Marsa beach History *Ancient Carthage was a Semitic civilization centered on the Phoenician city- state of Carthage, located in North Africa on the Gulf of Tunis, outside what is now Tunis, Tunisia. It was founded in 814 BC. Originally a dependency of the Phoenician state of Tyre, Carthage gained independence around 650 BC and established a hegemony over other Phoenician settlements throughout the Mediterranean, North Africa and what is now Spain which lasted until the end of the 3rd century BC. At the height of the city's prominence, its political influence extended over most of the western Mediterranean and it was one of the major trade hubs. *For much of its history, Carthage was in a constant state of struggle with the Greeks on Sicily and the Roman Republic, which led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Sicilian Wars and Punic Wars. They also had to deal with the volatile Berbers, the indigenous inhabitants of the entire area where Carthage was built. In 146 BC, after the third and final Punic War, Carthage was destroyed and then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the other Phoenician city-states and former Carthaginian dependencies fell into Roman hands from then on.

The squadron was the first Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) unit for both CVW-14 and later CVW-2. VF-2 deployed aboard in 1984 and returned for multiple Ranger deployments throughout the 1980s. On 2 June 1984, VF-2 became the first squadron to launch an F-14 from an aircraft carrier while towing an air-to-air gunnery target. In 1987, the squadron logged Ranger’s 260,000th landing. =1990s= F-14D Tomcat from VF-2 passing the bow of the aircraft carrier USS Constellation after having been launched from one of the waist catapults The unit participated in Operation Desert Storm, flying over 500 combat mission from USS Ranger operating in the Persian Gulf.

After the 1992-1993 cruise, USS Ranger was decommissioned (along with VF-2’s sister squadron VF-1), and VF-2 was switched to the . At the same time, VF-2 transitioned to the F-14D Tomcat. Several months after the 1995 cruise, VF-2 was awarded the battle \\"E\\" and relocated from NAS Miramar to NAS Oceana due to a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision to make Miramar a Marine Corps Air Station. In April 1996, VF-2's F-14Ds were modified to carry the LANTIRN infrared targeting pod, giving them precision strike capabilities. During their 1999 cruise, VF-2 supported Operation Southern Watch and on September 9, attacked Surface-to-Air Missile sites and anti-aircraft guns around Basra. The same day, a VF-2 Tomcat engaged 2 Iraqi Air Force MiG-23’s that were heading south into the No-Fly Zone from Al-Taqaddum Air Base, west of Baghdad with AIM-54 Phoenixes.

The boats serve a variety of missions, including search and rescue, port security and law enforcement duties and replaces a variety of smaller non-standard boats. The design length of the hull is 25 feet and the boat is officially referred to as such. However, the overall length with engines mounted is approximately . Powered by twin outboard motors, they are capable of speeds in excess of and have a range of 150 to , depending on the class. The boat requires a minimum crew of two persons, but has a carrying capacity for 10 persons. The boat is easily trailerable and can be transported by a C-130 Hercules aircraft or truck. Although similar in appearance to a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, the Defender is actually an aluminum-hulled vessel, equipped with a rigid foam-filled flotation collar. The first generation of boats were built by SAFE Boats International (Secure All-around Flotation Equipped) of Bremerton, Washington, a vendor of government and law enforcement boats. The replacement second generation was ordered in 2011 from Metal Shark Boats. Design The Defender class utilizes a rigid deep-V hull constructed of marine grade aluminum. While similar in appearance to the sponson of a rigid-hulled inflatable boat the Defender's collar is actually made from rigid polyethylene foam. The boat is powered by two outboard engines, usually Honda four-strokes though Mercury and Johnson engines have also been used. Tow bitts are fitted forward and aft which also serve as mounting points for M240B or M60 machine guns. Variants =A class= A Defender A-class boat from Maritime Safety and Security Team 91106 in New York Harbor. The Defender A class or Response Boat - Homeland Security (RB-HS) was the first version of the Defender class and entered service in 2002. Some A-class boats in service with the Maritime Security Response Team (MSRT) have gray collars instead of the more common orange. =B class= The Defender B-class, also known as the Response Boat - Small (RB-S) is a further development of the A class. First entering service in 2003 it has a slightly longer cabin, additional spotter windows aft, shock mitigating cabin seats, a smaller 105 gallon fuel tank, and various other minor changes. It is the most common of the three classes. =C class= Guantanamo Bay The Defender C class, sometimes known as the Response Boat Small - Charlie, is a modification of the B class and was designed as a replacement for the aging Transportable Port Security Boats (TPSB) currently used by Port Security Units. The C class has a gray foam collar, a cabin climate control system, and an increased armament of one M2HB .50-caliber machine gun on a modified forward mount and two M240B machine guns on port and starboard mounts just aft of the cabin. The first C-class boats were delivered to Port Security Unit 305 in May 2008 for testing and entered operational service at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in 2009.http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/wire/wire/WirePDF/v9/Issue%2049v9.pdf The Wire Vol 9, Issue 49 A Defender-class boat in service with the Kenya Navy Special Boat Unit Service life and replacement With the Defender-class boats nearing the end of their 10-year service life, the Coast Guard issued a request for proposal for replacement design for the Response Boat-Small. The request called for a 25–30 foot boat, with weapon mounts, a minimum speed of 40 knots, and a range of at least 150 nautical miles. Contracts were awarded for two boats, one from SAFE Boats International and one from Metal Shark Aluminum Boats, for testing and on September 26, 2011 the Coast Guard awarded a contract to Metal Shark Boats for the production of 38 Response Boats-Small.

Admissions Collingwood is the largest secondary school in Surrey, with over 2,000 pupils, including more than 400 in the sixth form. It occupies a campus and is divided in the three main areas 'Kingston' (Years 10 & 11) and 'Barossa' (Years 7–9), and the new, purpose- built, sixth form centre. This was funded by the sale of land, on which the college's previous sixth form centre (named 'Ballard') was situated. Collingwood College is a DfE designated high-performing specialist academy, specialising in technology and vocational-education. It is situated just north of the A30, near the Jolly Farmer roundabout on the Old Dean Estate, Camberley. History =Earlier school= The school derives itself from the Frimley and Camberley County Grammar School, the Bagshot County Secondary School, and the Barossa County Secondary School. In July 1970, Surrey County Council wavered over whether to go ahead with the comprehensive plan. =Comprehensive= The first Headmaster in 1971 was Mr. Leonard Roe, who had previously been Headmaster of the grammar school. He was followed by Peter Halls-Dickerson, who was a major advocate of the idea of direct grant schools. Collingwood was one of the earliest direct grant schools to be created after the passage of the legislation by the then Conservative government. The headmaster from 1974 until the 1990s was Peter Halls-Dickerson. =Grant- maintained school= On 1 September 1991 Collingwood School became Collingwood College – a grant-maintained school. This change of status was overwhelmingly supported by the parents. In 1999, under the new schools' framework, the school adopted foundation status. In September 1994 Collingwood College became a self-governing technology college. Following the new funding, the school built the Halls-Dickerson Technology Centre, also one of the first of its kind. As of 1 April 2008, the college was granted high-performing specialist school status. The school also specialises in vocational education, which provides education for working life; such as hairdressing, building and other manual labour based jobs. Collingwood is a founding member of the Surrey Heath Area Partnership for Education (SHAPE), Surrey's 14–19 network. SHAPE runs diploma courses in IT, for which Collingwood is the lead school and also Society Health and Development. Future diplomas will be offered in business and finance and creative media which will begin in 2009. Catchment Its catchment area encompasses much of the Surrey Heath area of Camberley, Bagshot, Lightwater, Ascot. Egham Windlesham, Bisley, Chobham and West End. Stabbing incident The school appeared in the national press following a November 2005 incident in which a student was repeatedly stabbed with a pair of scissors, including one wound above the eye. The school was also featured on a special programme called \\"School of Hard Knocks\\" on ITV that was aired on 6 November 2006. It examined the assault in some detail. It featured an interview with Natashia and her parents, as well as stories from other victims of bullying. The programme publicly criticised the Principal for denying that there was a bullying problem at Collingwood. However, an OFSTED report in 2007 showed that there were no serious problems with bullying at Collingwood College. A separate stabbing took place at the school by Sharon Carr in 1994 when she was just 14 years old. Carr stabbed a fellow pupil in the back puncturing her lung in the school toilets. The victim survived. However, it later came to light that Carr was responsible for the murder of a local hairdresser two years before. Carr is the youngest female to be convicted of murder in the UK.https://murderpedia.org/female.C/c/carr-sharon.htm Collingwood College Productions Every year Collingwood Productions stage their annual musical. The productions are auditioned in the first two weeks of December, allowing the principals to get to grips with their parts over the holidays. They then return in January to begin the rehearsal process. After the two and a half-month period the shows are staged around the last week of March and normally run for four nights, Wednesday to Saturday. Teaching Due to the huge number of students at Collingwood, the school is very organised in its hierarchy of staff. Each year has a Head of Year and Pastoral Assistant, who move up with the students through their years at the school. Also, each assistant principal is assigned to a year, to take care of other pastoral issues. All subjects that are taught at the school are assigned a faculty, where the faculty head assists with the running of the subjects, and provides behavioural support to the teachers in their faculty. Sixth Form Centre The sixth form was originally housed in the \\"Ballard\\" building. Before becoming part of Collingwood School, it had been built for Cordwalles/Cordwallis Boys School,https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3177229 then taken over during the Second World War as Cordwallis MT [Motor Transport] Training Centre for the Auxiliary Territorial Service. It was at this site that Princess Elizabeth trained to drive an Austin K2/Y ambulance as a subaltern.http://www.atsremembered.org.uk/hallsheetpdf.pdf After the war, the building was taken over by the independent Great Ballard School, who occupied it until the 1960s. In 2005, a new Sixth Form Centre was officially opened by the Countess of Wessex. The Ballard building and its surrounding land was sold, and it was subsequently demolished to be replaced by housing. The Sixth Form Centre features an extremely modernised architecture, a series of seven small IT classrooms plus one large computer suite on the top floor. The centre provides facilities for sixth form students such as a common room and private study area. Academic performance Collingwood performs consistently above both the LEA (Surrey) and national average at both GCSE and A-Level.

Plot This video game was based on a Viking Child called Brian who must enter the Halls of Valhalla and do battle against the evil god Loki and his minions. Gameplay The game closely resembled Sega's Wonder Boy in Monster Land, as certain elements like collecting hidden gold, upgrading the character's weapons and visiting shops were practically identical, despite the difference in release times. There is no save game feature but passwords can be earned and used to allow access to later levels. Reception Robert A. Jung reviewed the Atari Lynx version of the game which was posted to IGN. In his final verdict he wrote \\"While Viking Child is a pleasant diversion, it is missing the refinements needed for greatness. The biggest appeal is in exploring the land and just trying to survive, but it should not be mistaken for an adventure game. Still, if you're looking for something that's a little more than the typical run-and-jump title, Viking Child is worth a try.\\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.

The two-track bridge is part of Conrail Shared Assets Operations and is jointly used by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation freight trains, as well as by the New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line service. History The lift span of the bridge in 1999 The Delair Bridge, built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1895–1896, was the first bridge of any sort between Philadelphia and New Jersey. The steel span connected PRR tracks in North Philadelphia to southern New Jersey. It consisted of three fixed Pennsylvania truss spans and a through-truss swing- span drawbridge totaling . Approach trestles of on the Pennsylvania side and on the New Jersey side bring its total length to . Starting in 1958, the PRR converted the bridge into a vertical-lift span to increase clearance for river traffic. The movable link was floated into place in one piece to facilitate installation and minimize delay. Work was completed in 1960. The Delair Bridge was the longest and heaviest double-track lift bridge in the world at the time. Note that the single-track Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge is longer. The bridge was also electrified in the late 1930s,The line to Pavnoia Yard or Atlantic City is not listed in Drawing ET-1, June 10, 1935. Electrification was likely after this, although the Richmond Substation was installed by 1932. allowing freight trains hauled by electric locomotives to access the Pavonia Yard in Camden, New Jersey, from the Northeast Corridor. Electrification was removed by January, 1967 but was restored in May 1973. However, Conrail ceased electric freight operations in 1981 and removed the wires several years later. Passenger train traffic on the bridge ceased in 1969 when Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines service was cut to Lindenwold station after the completion of the PATCO Speedline, but was restored in 1989 when Amtrak began the Atlantic City Express service. Amtrak service ended in 1995, but New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line service has used the bridge continuously since 1993. The bridge's southern track was formerly reserved for freight traffic, and the northern track only used for the Atlantic City Line. As part of the Pennsauken Transit Center project, a station complex where the River LINE passes under the Delair Bridge's eastern approach, platforms were built on both tracks. Both tracks are now used by both passenger and freight trains. 21st century rehabilitation An NJT Atlantic City Line train on the bridge in 2015 In December 2011, an $18.5 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant was awarded to South Jersey Port Corporation by the United States Department of Transportation, partially for rehabilitation of the bridge. http://www.ifw-net.com/freightpubs/ifw/index/us- invests-62-million-in-ports/20017927100.htm The improvements were completed.

History No firm date can be established for the composition, and it has even been conjectured that the 2 parts were composed separately, with the toccata being a potentially more mature piece. Williams however describes that the differing Affekt of the two parts does not pose any problem to the hypothesis that the whole work was composed at the same period. This conception of \\"complementary movements\\" was even a favourite of Bach's, and the dramatic nature of the toccata as contrasted to the masterful counterpoint of the fugue should \\"not be misunderstood as mere discrepancy\\". Because of the range of the pedal parts, the toccata may have been written for a performance, around 1713, at the Weißenfels organ, with its pedal going up to f'.

It is then followed by a pedal solo based upon material from the canon. The canon is reiterated with some variations in the dominant in C major. This time the hands are switched, and the left hand leads the right. This is again followed by a long pedal solo. The two large canon flourishes cover 108 measures of the composition. The pedal solos cover 60 measures. The concerto movement exhibits a seven-part structure. The canons and pedal solos effect the departure from the home key of F to the dominant C, and the entire rest of the movement, with its concertante 3-part imitation and striking \\"proto- waltzes\\", constitute the harmonic return. This formal pattern is unique within Bach's œuvre. Hermann Keller expresses his rapture as follows: \\" At the beginning the extensive linear construction of the two voices in canon, the proud calmness of the solos in the pedal, the piercing chord strokes, the fiery upswing of the second subject, the bold modulatory shifts, the inwardness of the three minor movements, the splendour of the end with the famous third inversion of the seventh chord, who would not be enthralled by that?\\"Hauk, Franz and Iris Winkler (translated by Regina Piskorsch-Feick), 2001, from liner notes p.4 for recording by Franz Hauk, Johann Sebastian Bach Organ masterworks, Guild Music Ltd GMCD 7217 The Toccata (as a prelude) is proportionally the largest of all Bach's works in the format of prelude-fugue. It is often treated as a show piece, with the ensuing fugue omitted. The Toccata's rhythmic signature suggests a passepied or a musette, although the monumental scale of the movement does not support these characterizations. Nor does the harmonic adventurousness: 45 measures after the second pedal solo there is a dominant chord which resolves deceptively to the third-inversion secondary dominant of the neapolitan chord. In particular, the doubled root is found to move outward in contrary chromatic motion to a major 9th; in the bass by a descending half tone, which absolutely could not be farther from the expected fifth. Bach implements this powerful deceptive cadence three times in the piece; it would not become idiomatic until Chopin and Tchaikovsky. =Fugue= { << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\tempo 4=120 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"flute\\" { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\time 2/2 \\\\relative c << { r1 r r r r %5 r r r r r %10 r f'1 e2 es d bes'~ bes a %15 g1 f e4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { r1 r r r r %5 c1 b2 bes a f'~ f e d1 %10 c1~ c4 b8 c d2~ d4 g,8 f g4 a bes c d e! f c f2~ %15 f e2~ e d2~ d } >> } } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"flute\\" { \\\\relative c { f1 e2 es d bes'~ bes a g1 %5 f4 g a2~ a4 d,8 c d4 e f g a b c g c2~ c bes~ %10 bes4 a8 g a4 f d g,2 a8 b c2. c4 g'2. f8 e d4 e f a, %15 bes g c bes a a' b g c } } } >> >> } The first subject (entries in the tenor, alto and soprano voices shown above) of the fugue is chromatic and ornamental. The second subject has a lot of modulation shifts and is sometimes initially presented as the counter-subject of the first. The Fugue is Bach's only thorough-going double fugue, where two subjects are exposed in separate sections and then combined. The effect is enhanced by the increasing rhythmic activity of the second subject and by the more frequent use of modulation in the final section of the fugue. The bravura of the F-Major toccata, with its pedal solos and manual virtuosity, contrasts sharply with the rather sober opening of the Fugue. Both represent two diverse aspects of Italian influence: the motoric rhythms and sequential passagework of the Toccata, and the traditional alla breve counterpoint of the Fugue, with its chromaticism, harmonic suspensions, and uninterrupted succession of subjects and answers. These techniques are very similar to those used in the \\"Dorian\\" Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538.  Use in popular culture  The toccata was used prominently in the 1962 film Phaedra starring Anthony Perkins and directed by Jules Dassin.

Introduced as \\"liquid\\" modernity by the Polish-British sociologist Zygmunt Bauman, late modernity is marked by the global capitalist economies with their increasing privatization of services and by the information revolution.  Versus postmodernity  Social theorists and sociologists such as Scott Lash, Ulrich Beck, Zygmunt Bauman, and Anthony Giddens maintain (against postmodernists) that modernization continues into the contemporary era, which is thus better conceived as a radical state of late modernity. On technological and social changes since the 1960s, the concept of \\"late modernity\\" proposes that contemporary societies are a clear continuation of modern institutional transitions and cultural developments. Such authors talk about a reflexive modernization as post-traditional order which impact day-to- day social life and personal activities. Modernity now tends to be self- referring, instead of being defined largely in opposition to traditionalism, as with classical modernity. Giddens does not dispute that important changes have occurred since \\"high\\" modernity, but he argues that we have not truly abandoned modernity. Rather, the modernity of contemporary society is a developed, radicalized, \\"late\\" modernity—but still modernity, not postmodernity. In such a perspective, postmodernism appears only as a hyper- technological version of modernity.  Subjects  The subject is constructed in late modernity against the backdrop of a fragmented world of competing and contrasting identities and lifestyle cultures. The framing matrix of the late modern personality is the ambiguous way the fluid social relations of late modernity impinge on the individual, producing a reflexive and multiple self.  Characteristics  Zygmunt Bauman, who introduced the idea of liquid modernity, wrote that its characteristics are about the individual, namely increasing feelings of uncertainty and the privatization of ambivalence. It is a kind of chaotic continuation of modernity, where a person can shift from one social position to another in a fluid manner. Nomadism becomes a general trait of the \\"liquid modern\\" person as she or he flows through her or his own life like a tourist, changing places, jobs, spouses, values, and sometimes moresuch as political or sexual orientationexcluding her- or himself from traditional networks of support, while also freeing her- or himself from the restrictions or requirements those networks impose. Bauman stressed the new burden of responsibility that fluid modernism placed on the individualtraditional patterns would be replaced by self-chosen ones. Entry into the globalized society was open to anyone with their own stance and the ability to fund it, in a similar way as was the reception of travellers at the old-fashioned caravanserai. The result is a normative mindset with emphasis on shifting rather than on stayingon provisional in lieu of permanent (or \\"solid\\") commitmentwhich (the new style) can lead a person astray towards a prison of their own existential creation.

The station is the northern terminus of the Ribble Valley Line / Clitheroe Line operated by Northern Trains and is north of Blackburn. The station forms part of Clitheroe Interchange, which has won a number of awards.  History  The original station opened on 22 June 1850. It was replaced in 1893/4 by another approximately to the north. The station closed to normal services on 10 September 1962 (that is, before the Beeching cuts) but remained in use for special services until 7 February 1971. The special services resumed on 14 May 1990, and the station was fully reopened on 29 May 1994, when passenger services began again from Blackburn. The line from here continues northwards towards , but this section is normally used only by freight and engineering trains on weekdays; passenger services are limited to a pair of Sundays only Dalesrail charter trains and occasional railtours. The line also forms part of a valuable strategic diversionary route between and , which is utilised if planned engineering work blocks the West Coast Main Line over Shap. It has also been used in emergency for unplanned work between these locations. Terminating trains from the Blackburn direction run empty up to Horrocksford Junction to the north (where the former Ribble Cement (now Hansons) factory branch diverges from the main line) and use the crossover there to reverse and change lines prior to returning to the station.Horrocksford Junction Crawford, Ewan Railscot 19 April 2008; Retrieved 8 April 2017 The station has since become an award-winning bus and train transport interchange.

As in WEB and CWEB, the main components of Noweb are two programs: \\"notangle\\", which extracts 'machine' source code from the source texts, and \\"noweave\\", which produces nicely-formatted printable documentation. Noweb supports TeX, LaTeX, HTML, and troff back ends and works with any programming language. Besides simplicity this is the main advantage over WEB, which needs different versions to support programming languages other than Pascal. (Thus the necessity of CWEB, which supports C and similar languages.) Noweb's input A Noweb input text contains program source code interleaved with documentation. It consists of so-called chunks that are either documentation chunks or code chunks. A documentation chunk begins with a line that starts with an at sign (@) followed by a space or newline. A documentation chunk has no name. Documentation chunks normally contain LaTeX, but Noweb is also used with HTML, plain TeX, and with troff. Code chunks are named. A code chunk begins with <>= on a line by itself. The double left angle bracket (<<) must be in the first column. Each chunk is terminated by the beginning of another chunk. If the first line in the file does not mark the beginning of a chunk, it is assumed to be the first line of a documentation chunk. Code chunks aren't treated specially by Noweb's tools—they may be placed in any order and, when needed, they are just concatenated. Chunk references in code are dereferenced and the whole requested source code is extracted. =Example of a simple Noweb program= This is an example of a \\"hello world\\" program with documentation: \\\\section{Hello world} Today I awoke and decided to write some code, so I started to write Hello World in \\\\textsf C. <>= /* <> */ #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { printf(\\"Hello World! \\"); return 0; } @ oindent \\\\ldots then I did the same in PHP. <>= > */ echo \\"Hello world! \\"; ?> @ \\\\section{License} Later the same day some lawyer reminded me about licenses. So, here it is: <>= This work is placed in the public domain. Assuming that the above code is placed in a file named 'hello.nw', the command to extract the human-readable document in HTML format is: noweave -filter l2h -index -html hello.nw htmltoc > hello.html ... and in LaTeX format: noweave -index -latex hello.nw > hello.tex To extract machine source code: notangle -Rhello.c hello.nw > hello.c notangle -Rhello.php hello.nw > hello.php Compatibility Noweb defines a specific file format and a file is likely to interleave three different formats (Noweb, LaTeX and the language used for the software). This is not recognised by other software development tools and consequently using Noweb excludes the use of UML or code documentation tools.

It is also known as science fiction poetry or fantastic poetry. It is distinguished from other poetic genres by being categorized by its subject matter, rather than by the poetry's form. Suzette Haden Elgin defined the genre as \\"about a reality that is in some way different from the existing reality.\\" Due to the similarity of subject matter, it is often published by the same markets that publish short stories and novellas of science fiction, fantasy and horror, and many authors write both in speculative fiction and speculative poetry. The field has one major award, the Rhysling Award, given annually to a poem of more than fifty lines and to a sub-fifty lines poem by the US-based Science Fiction Poetry Association. History Much of the Romantic poetry of the 19th century used techniques seen in modern fantasy literature: retellings of classical mythology and European folklore, both to show alternative angles in the stories and to explore social issues. Many distinguished poets here were women, and many used folktales as an acceptable social camouflage with which to explore feminist concerns. One of the most celebrated of these poems, Christina Rossetti's 1862 \\"Goblin Market\\", remains a source of critical debate. Andrew Joron wrote in 1981, that over the past decade in the United States \\"it was possible to create a tradition, that established and defined the genre\\" of science fiction poetry. In common with the gradual recognition of science fiction and fantasy as distinct literary genres in the 1930s, science-fictional poetry began publication as a distinct genre in the pulp magazines of the United States. Fantasy-specific Weird Tales (1923–1954) and its brief compatriot Unknown (1939–43) were the only major publishers. They were succeeded by more serious venues including the US-based The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (F&SF;) (1949–), the UK-based flagship of the New Wave movement New Worlds while it was under the editorship of Michael Moorcock between 1964 and 1970, and the annual reprint anthologies of F&SF; and The Year's Best Science Fiction edited by Judith Merril. These anthologies drew much of their content from mainstream or literary sources. In the 1960s, anthologies of original speculative material began to be published. F&SF; ceased accepting poetry in 1977, a gap in the market taken up by the newly established Asimov's. The Science Fiction Poetry Association (SFPA) was founded by Suzette Haden Elgin the following year. In the 1970s, Elgin's colleague Frederick J. Mayer for some time awarded an annual Clark Ashton Smith Award for best fantastic poetry. By 1990, Asimov's remained the major news-stand market, but a diverse array of predominantly US-based small press markets had developed, many lasting several decades, and many choosing purely electronic publication post-2000. This is in common with mainstream written poetry in the US over this time. SFPA (now called the Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry Association) awards the Rhysling for short- and long-form SF and fantasy poetry awards annually; most winners have been either science fiction or science-themed rather than fantasy or horror. Most Rhysling nominees have been from the small-press poetry journals Dreams & Nightmares, The Magazine of Speculative Poetry, and the SFPA's own journal, Star*Line. Winners are reprinted in the Nebula Awards anthology. The Horror Writers Association has a separate recognition for single-author collections of horror poetry, the Bram Stoker Award, though there is no facility in the Bram Stoker Award to honour anthologies of horror/weird poetry. Subgenres and themes =Science fiction= Science fiction poetry's main sources are the sciences and the literary movement of science fiction prose. Scientifically-informed verse, sometimes termed poetry of science, is a branch that has either scientists and their work or scientific phenomena as its primary focus; it may also use scientific jargon as metaphor. Important collections in this area include the 1985 anthology of predominantly Science-published poems Songs from Distant Worlds. This area often sees work by mainstream poets, and works on these themes dominated the early years of the Rhysling awards. =Mythic= Mythic poetry deals with myth and folklore, with a particular focus on reinterpreting and retelling traditional stories. =Horror= Horror poetry is a subset which, in the same way as horror fiction, concentrates on ghostly, macabre, spectral, supernatural themes. Modern horror poetry may also introduce themes of sadism, violence, gore, and the like. =Weird= Weird poetry is a subset. It differs in several important ways from straightforward modern horror poetry. It arises from the early 20th century literary tradition of 'the weird' also known as weird fiction, in which certain groups of authors collectively attempted to move beyond tired old stories of haunted castles, graveyard ghosts, and suave vampires. It tends to be concerned with the subtly uncanny, and is expressed in macabre and serious tones. The atmospheres of a certain place may be evoked, and the narrator may discover certain weird details of that place which arouse a sense of unexplainable dread. Some weird poetry will describe timeless geological forces or the night sky, trying to harness the feeling of dread to a wider and sublime 'cosmic awe' about mankind's insignificance in the universe. Yet the narrators of such poetry tend to be unreliable, and may perhaps be on the edge of madness. They may describe or hint at unreal nature-defying events which occur in otherwise normal places - although without the overt technical explanation found in science fiction, and without the violence and sadism common to modern post-1970 horror. S. T. Joshi's short book of essays Emperors of Dreams: Some Notes on Weird Poetry (2008) examines a number of key weird poets. While weird poetry has appeared in a vast array of anthologies and journals (both professional and small-press), perhaps the first journal devoted exclusively to this form is Spectral Realms, founded in 2013 by editor S.T. Joshi and published by Hippocampus Press.

Its history began in 1704 when Henry Strode bequeathed £6,000 to set up a free school in his native parish of Egham. In the twentieth century Strode's became a boys' grammar school before being designated a sixth form college in 1975.Strode's College - How Strode's started At present it has a roll of 1100 students aged 16 to 18. It achieved an overall pass rate of 98% at A Level and 100% success in 28 A Level subjects, with over a third of its A Level students achieving either one or more A* or A grades. The college also provides a wide range of day and evening Adult Education courses.Strode's College - Adult Education In September 2016, the College announced its intention to merge with East Berkshire College in February 2017. Alumni of the college are sometimes referred to as Old Strodians . History The college traces its origins to the free school founded by Henry Strode and co-workers Timothy Windsor and Ben Jackson. This School and the Almshouses were built on the same site in Egham in 1706. The original buildings were pulled down. Of their replacements, built in 1828, two ranges of almshouses remain. Listed as historic buildings, they are still in use by the college. The present main college building dates from 1915. The school has been known previously as Strode's School and as Strode's Grammar School from 1919 until 1975, when it became Strode's College.Our History The Worshipful Company of Coopers From the time of its foundation the Coopers' Company was the Trustee of Henry Strode's Charity which administered the School but in 1912 the Charity Commissioners drafted a new Scheme which gave the School its own Board of Governors, changed it from an elementary to a secondary school and brought it into the Surrey education system. Under further changes introduced following the 1944 Education Act, the School was granted Voluntary Controlled status as a Boys' Grammar School and the composition of its Governing Body set to include four Foundation Trustees, one of whom, at least, was to be a representative of the Company. The Company continues to provide funds administered by the Foundation Trustees for the benefit of the college.

The ellipsis is introduced by a wh-expression, whereby in most cases, everything except the wh-expression is elided from the clause. Sluicing has been studied in detail in early 21st century and it is therefore a relatively well understood type of ellipsis.See for instance Ross (1969), Chung et al. (1995), and Merchant (2001). Sluicing occurs in many languages.See Merchant's (2001) extensive account of sluicing; it includes examples from numerous languages. Basic examples Sluicing is illustrated with the following examples. In each case, an embedded question is understood though only a question word or phrase is pronounced. (The intended interpretations of the question-denoting elliptical clause are given in parentheses; parts of these are anaphoric to the boldface material in the antecedent.) ::Phoebe ate something, but she doesn't know what. (=what she ate) ::Jon doesn't like the lentils, but he doesn't know why. (=why he doesn't like the lentils) ::Someone has eaten the soup. Unfortunately, I don't know who. (=who has eaten the soup) Sluicing in these examples occurs in indirect questions. It is also frequent in direct questions across speakers, e.g. ::Somebody is coming for dinner tonight. - Who? (=Who is coming for dinner tonight)? ::They put something in the mailbox. - What? (=What did they put in the mailbox)? The examples of sluicing above have the sluiced material following its antecedent. This material can also precede its antecedent, e.g. ::I don't know why, but the pictures have been moved. (=why the pictures have been moved) ::When and how is unclear, but somebody should say something. (=when and how somebody should say something) Merchant (2001) states that these and other examples of sluicing can be organized into four categories of sluicing constructions. These types include sluices with adjunct wh-phrases, sluices with overt correlates, sluices with implicit arguments and contrast sluices. The first type refers to when the wh-phrase does not have an elided copy of the antecedent but is an adjunct. The following example from Algryani (2019) shows this: : ::Zayd rāḥ, lakǝn ma-adri mita /wein. ::Zayd left.3MS but NEG-know.1S when/where ::‘Zayd left, but I don’t know when/where.’ 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. : The second type refers to a correlate in the antecedent clause that is indefinite. This is shown in the above example about someone eating the soup, with ‘someone’ being the indefinite correlate of ‘who’. The third type of sluicing construction refers to when the wh-word is not referring to a term in the antecedent but is referring to an object that corresponds to the preceding verb. The following example from Algryani (2019) shows this: : ::Fatema təqra, lakǝn ma-ʕaraf eiš. ::Fatema read.3FS but NEG-know.1S what ::‘Fatema is reading, but I don’t know what.’ : The final type of sluicing construction occurs when the elided material correspondent contrasts that of what is in the antecedent. The following example from Algryani (2019) shows this: : ::Zayd ʕand-ah walad, lakǝn ma-adri kam bent. ::Zayd has.3MS son but NEG-know.1S how many daughter ::‘Zayd has a son, but I don’t know how many daughters.’ :  Theoretical approaches to sluicing  There are two theoretical approaches that have been proposed for how sluicing occurs in languages. Ross (1969) is the first examination of sluicing; he argued that sluicing involves regular wh-fronting followed by deletion of the sister constituent of the wh-phrase. This analysis has been expanded in greater detail in Merchant (2001), the most comprehensive treatise on sluicing to date. A second kind of analysis is represented by Ginzburg and Sag (2000) and Culicover and Jackendoff (2005), both of which present nonstructural analyses of ellipsis, and do not posit unpronounced elliptical material. Yet another account of sluicing builds on the catena unit; the elided material is a catena.  Movement approach  The movement approach states that sluicing is a product of the syntactic derivation in which an embedded clause is built in the syntax and then the wh-phrase within the embedded clause moves outside of the constituent to the position of SpecCP (specifier to the complementizer phrase). These steps are then followed by the deletion (and therefore non-pronunciation) of the tense phrase node that contains the rest of the clause. Evidence for this approach is seen in the connectivity effects of case marking, binding and preposition stranding as outlined in Merchant (2001). Case-marking in sluicing Interrogative phrases in languages with morphological case-marking show the case appropriate to the understood verb as Ross, (1969) and Merchant, (2001), illustrated here with the German verb \\"schmeicheln\\" (to flatter), which governs the dative case on its object. :: Er hat jemandem geschmeichelt, aber ich weiß nicht, wem. ::he has someone.DAT flattered but I know not who.DAT ::\\"He flattered someone, but I don't know who.\\" The sluiced wh-phrase must bear the same case that its counterpart in a non-elided structure would bear Merchant, (2001). Preposition-stranding in sluicing It has been concluded that languages that forbid preposition-stranding in question formation also forbid it in sluicing Merchant (2001), Stjepanovic, (2008), as in the following example from German: ::Er hat mit jemandem gesprochen, aber ich weiß nicht, *(mit) wem. ::he has with someone spoken but I know not with who ::\\"He spoke with someone, but I don't know (with) who.\\" Examples of languages where p-stranding does not occur are Greek, German, and Russian. Much research has been done to determine if sluicing can allow for preposition-stranding in a non- preposition-stranding language. Stjepanović, (2008) conducted research on whether this is possible in the non-preposition-stranding language, Serbo- Croatian. She concluded that there is not enough evidence to contradict the initial claim made by Ross. However, she did find that a preposition may be lost or removed from a sentence under sluicing in Serbo-Croatian. More research is to be conducted to confirm the official cause of this preposition- loss. An example of the preposition-loss shown by Stjepanović, (2008) is displayed below. ::Petar je sakrio igradku ispod jedne stolice i pored jednog zida, ali ne znam (ispod) koje stolice i (pored) kojeg zida. ::Gloss Petar is hidden toy under one chair.GEN and beside one wall. gen but not I.know under which chair.GEN and beside which wall.GEN 4 ::Translation Petar hid the toy under a chair and beside a wall, but I don't know which chair and which wall.'  Binding  Merchant (2003) demonstrates that binding supports the movement approach using the following sentence: ::Every linguist1 criticized some of his1 work, but I’m not sure how much of his1 work ~~[every linguist 1 criticized t]~~ In order for the second “his work” to refer to “every linguist” in the above example, it must be c-commanded by its antecedent within its local domain. Here, “his work” could not be coreferential with the subject: “every linguist” at the beginning of the sentence because it is outside of its local domain. This provides evidence that “his work” originally started off in the elided constituent where it could be c-commanded and in the local domain of that “every linguist” before it moved out of the clause.  Non-movement approach  There are also several theoretical approaches to sluicing that do not involve the movement of the wh-phrase out of the embedded clause. These approaches include PF deletion and LF copying. PF deletion as proposed in Lasnik (2007) states that the TP within the embedded clause is null and has syntactic structure within it that is elided following a wh- movement operation. The other approach, LF copying, is a process proposed by Lobeck (1995) in which the original structure of a sluicing phrase is one in which the wh-word originates in the SpecCP position of the embedded clause and a null phrase marker (marked e) occupies the position of the tense phrase of the embedded clause. This is the extent of the syntactic derivation. After this structure is derived, it is sent off for semantic interpretation, to logical form, in which the implied material in the tense phrase is then present for our full understanding of the sentence. The evidence for this approach is that it is able to account for islands in sluicing as is discussed below.  Islands in sluicing  Sluicing has garnered considerable attention because it appears, as Ross (1969) first discussed, to allow wh-fronting to violate the island conditions he discovered: :: They want to hire someone who speaks a Balkan language, but I don't remember which one. (=*which one they want to hire someone who speaks) Sluicing allows a sentence that contains an island to retain its meaning and remain grammatical. As mentioned by Abels, (2018), there is an ongoing debate on whether this can happen in all situations or if it is island dependent. ::A biography of one of the Marx brothers will be published later this year, guess which (of the Marx brothers) [a biography of which ~~of the Marx brothers]~~ will be published later this year. ::A biography of on of the Marx brothers will be published later this year, guess which. The first example is ungrammatical because the island prevents us from moving anything out of the subject constituent (shown in square brackets). The second example is saved through sluicing as the island is sluiced and the meaning can be inferred from the context of the sentence, therefore maintaining the meaning and remaining grammatical. Multiple sluicing In some languages, sluicing can leave behind more than one wh-phrase (multiple remnant sluicing): ::Someone wants to eat something. ?I wish I knew who what. (=who wants to eat what) ::?Something is causing someone big problems, although it's not clear what who. (=what is causing who big problems) Sentences like these are considered acceptable in languages like German, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, Russian, and others, although in English, their acceptability seems marginal (but see Bolinger 1978, Merchant 2001, and Richards 2010 for examples). Lasnik 2014 discusses the fact that the wh-phrase remnants in multiple sluicing must be clausemates: :: *Someone told me that something broke, but I don't remember who what. (≠who told me that what broke) Issues with different approaches to sluicing Only the catena-based approach handles multiple sluicing without further elaboration. The structural movement analysis must rely on some other type of movement to evacuate the noninitial wh-phrase from the ellipsis site; proposals for this additional movement include extraposition or shifting and need to be able to account for islands in sluicing. The nonstructural analysis must add phrase-structure rules to allow an interrogative clause to consist of multiple wh-phrases and be able to account for connectivity effects. The catena-based approach, however, does not account for the locality facts; since catenae can span multiple clauses, the fact that multiply-sluiced wh-phrases must be clausemates is a mystery.  Sluicing in other languages  = Omani Arabic = Sluicing has also been analyzed in Omani Arabi as is shown in Algryani (2019). All four of the above stated sluicing constructions outlined by Merchant (2001) are accounted for in Omani Arabic. Algryani (2019) displays the different constructions in the following examples: Sluices with Adjunct Wh-Phrases ::Zayd rāḥ, lakǝn ma-adri mita /wein. ::Zayd left.3MS but NEG- know.1S when/where ::‘Zayd left, but I don’t know when/where.’ Sluices with Overt Correlates ::Zaid qabǝl ḥad, lakǝn ma-aʕraf mi:n. ::Zaid met.3MS someone but NEG-know.1S. who ::‘Zaid met someone, but I don’t know who.’ Sluices with Implicit Arguments ::Fatema təqra, lakǝn ma-ʕaraf eiš. ::Fatema read.3FS but NEG-know.1S what ::‘Fatema is reading, but I don’t know what.’ Contrast Sluices ::Zayd ʕand-ah walad, lakǝn ma-adri kam bent. ::Zayd has.3MS son but NEG-know.1S how many daughter ::‘Zayd has a son, but I don’t know how many daughters.’ = Danish = The following example from Merchant, (2003) displays sluicing in Danish: ::Peter har snakket med en eller anden, men jeg ved ikke hvem. ::Peter has talked with one or another but I know not who. ::Peter has talked with someone, but I don't know who. = German = The following example from Abels, (2018) displays sluicing in German: ::Hans will jemanden helfen, aber ich weiß nicht wem. ::Hans wants someone help but I know not who. ::Hans wants to help someone, but I don't know who. = Japanese = The following example from Merchant (2003) displays sluicing in Japanese: ::Abby-ga dareka-o mi-ta ga, watashi-wa dare ka wakaranai. ::Abby-NOM someone-ACC see-PAST but I-TOP who Q know.not ::‘Abby saw someone, but I don’t know who.’ = Korean = The following example from Kim & Sells (2013) displays sluicing in Korean: ::Mimi-ka khu-n cha-lul sa-ss- nuntey, elmana khu-nci molukeyssta ::Mimi-NOM big-MOD car-ACC buy-PAST-but how big-QCOMP not.know ::‘Mimi bought a big car, but I don’t know how big.’ Notes References *Abels, K. 2018.

As a part of Interstate 95, it is a major highway link between Philadelphia and New York City. The bridge also connects the Pennsylvania Turnpike's east-west mainline with the main trunk of the New Jersey Turnpike, via the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension (formerly known as the Pennsylvania Extension). Tolls are collected only in the west/southbound direction via electronic toll collection. History The bridge was built by both the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) when the PTC completed the \\"Delaware River Extension\\" of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Valley Forge and Bristol Township in 1955, while the NJTA built the NJ Turnpike between Penns Grove and Ridgefield Park between 1950 and 1952. While the Pennsylvania Turnpike itself predates its New Jersey counterpart by over 10 years (the original Irwin-Carlisle section opened in 1940), the expansion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to a cross-state highway was put on hold for the duration of World War II. Starting with the upsurge of automobile traffic in 1946, the Pennsylvania Turnpike expanded from the original highway west from Irwin to the Ohio border and east from Carlisle to Valley Forge. At the same time, New Jersey, lacking a high-speed corridor, undertook the building of the New Jersey Turnpike under the auspices of then-Governor of New Jersey Alfred E. Driscoll. In order to provide a high-speed, low-interruption route from New York City to the Midwest, both the PTC and the NJTA undertook the building of the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge (known locally as the \\"Turnpike Connector Bridge\\") to connect the two highways. A local AAA chapter spearheaded a failed effort to have the bridge named after William Penn. To maintain the \\"high-speed, low-interruption\\" characteristics (\\"low interruption\\" referring to the few stops needed to pay tolls or fuel up at the numerous full-service plazas on both routes), the new bridge was designed from the beginning as a high-level crossing. This sharply contrasts with the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge located downstream as they are both drawbridges, and are subject to frequent openings to allow large ships up and down stream (all other bridges downstream from the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge are high level crossings). On January 3, 2016, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission implemented cashless tolling via either E-ZPass or TOLL BY PLATE, which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner. The toll is collected only from traffic crossing into Pennsylvania, as with the other bridges across the Delaware River. On January 20, 2017, the bridge was closed after a fracture was discovered in a steel component. On February 3, 2017, Pennsylvania Turnpike officials announced that the bridge would remain closed until at least April 2017. The failure was located in an I-beam located approximately above ground on the Pennsylvania side and caused the bridge to drop by about . Steel plates were installed as a temporary patch to stabilize the bridge and prevent further movement. The Assistant Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stated that ...\\"the crack likely was caused by a combination of factors, including age and plug welds that were commonly used in the 1950s to fill mistakenly drilled holes.\\" The bridge reopened to traffic on March 9, 2017, with unseasonably warm weather helping speed up work in repairing the bridge. On September 22, 2018, the bridge became part of Interstate 95 when the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project's first components of construction were completed. Previously, the Pennsylvania side of the bridge was considered part of Interstate 276. Maintenance Eastbound across the bridge The Turnpike Connector bridge is operated jointly by the PTC and the NJTA, neither of which is subject to the interstate rules and regulations of the other dual-state authorities — Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA); Burlington County Bridge Commission (BCBC); Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA); and the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission (DRJTBC) — which operate nearly all other bridges across the Delaware River (except for the Dingman's Ferry Bridge, which is privately owned). Each state is responsible for its half of the bridge up to the state line (as evident in a recent redecking project in which the PTC redecked its half of the bridge with fresh concrete first, with the NJTA following later in a separate project). In 2011, the NJTA and PTC undertook an investigation of the existing suspender system on the main span. Based on destructive testing of suspenders from the similar Newark Bay Bridge, consultants HNTB determined that the Delaware River bridge's suspenders had limited remaining service life and needed to be replaced. At each suspender location, the load from each original wire rope was transferred into a set of four new wire ropes, after which the original suspender was cut. The project was completed in August 2013. Future construction The final component of the direct interchange project between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Interstate 95 in Bristol Township is the replacement of the Delaware River Bridge. As originally planned, a second, parallel span of the bridge identical in appearance to the original 1956 span was to be constructed. However, in March 2020 the New Jersey Turnpike Authority announced in their capital improvement plan that the 1956 span will be replaced and a new study will be formed to determine the design of the new roadways. The new bridge is not planned to begin construction until at least 2025.

It was founded in May 1972 by the Dominican priest Rev. Fr. Rogelio B. Alarcon, OP who became its first rector. UST Angelicum is an official member of the Dominican Network. It attained Level II Primary Accreditation conducted by PAASCUPAASCU History UST Angelicum College started out as an educator's simple dream to break free from the traditional educational system. The educator's name is Fr. Rogelio Alarcon, O.P. When he was an elementary student at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, he had already begun toying with the idea of a school that would cater to the individual needs of each student and discard the traditional concept of grading. But it would be years later before his idea would take serious shape. He started to expound on the system without grades, without failures while making comparative studies on the different systems of education while studying at the UST Graduate School. In 1972, a few months after he was appointed first Provincial of the Philippine Dominican Province, he was able to convince some educators and the Province to put up a non-graded school. It was to be called \\"Angelicum\\" after one of the Dominican houses of studies in Rome and its whole existence would be justified by the nature of each individual child. Its philosophy would be \\"to do what is best for the learners.\\" In May of 1972, the Ministry of Education and Culture granted permission for the operation of this unique school. It was opened after one month of relentless activity which involved looking for a building, recruiting teachers, enrolling students, getting classroom materials, and arranging for school services. On July 5, 1972, Angelicum School was born: six classrooms and a small library all housed at the Dominican seminary; 315 young boys under the care of 9 creative, responsible and experienced teachers who were willing to undertake a paradigm shift. It carried out the embodiment of the Dominican ideals of charity, justice, and fortitude. Angelicum became the first non- graded school in the Philippines. In the second year of its existence, Angelicum's enrollment doubled. The first floor of the St. Dominic Building was finished in time to house the fast growing populace. In 1974, girls were accepted to meet \\"the need to normalize the environment.\\" A total of 220 enrolled in the Nursery to YS 5 Levels. Likewise, the St. Martin Building was then ready for the learners. Angelicum expanded beyond Quezon City. Two branches were established: Angelicum Tehran, Iran and Angelicum Jaro, Iloilo. But due to the religious war in Iran, Angelicum Tehran was closed in 1979. School directors In 1978, Rev. Fr. Norberto Castillo, O.P. became the director of the school. The number of students continued to rise and the school gained wider acclaim in the country's educational system. On May 11, 1979, the school library was named Fr. Ed Lumboy Memorial Resource Center in honor of Rev. Fr. Ed Lumboy, one of the school's resident priests who died in a vehicular accident. Rev. Fr. Hilario Singian, O.P. succeeded Fr. Castillo in 1982. During his term, the St. Vincent Covered Court was completed. After one year, Fr. Singian was replaced by Rev. Fr. Juan Ponce, O.P., who became director for four years. The St. Tomas Building was constructed during this period. In 1987, Rev. Fr. Honorato Castigador, O.P. replaced Fr. Ponce. In 1988, the directorship of the school was given to Rev. Fr. Tamerlane Lana, O.P. The St. Martin Building was renovated in his term. The old cafetorium was expanded and was operational in 1991. In 1994, Rev. Fr. Rogelio Alarcon, O.P. came back to be the seventh director of Angelicum. Indefatigable in the pursuit of his principles and ideals, he brought back the real essence of the non-graded system. The modular approach was adopted. In 1995, the College Department was opened and the school was renamed Angelicum College in May 1996. In August of the same year, recognition of the Home Study Program was granted. The swimming pool and a new Computer Laboratory were constructed and the Computer Program was extended to the YS 1 to YS 11 learners. The improvement of the football field was also done during this period. In the year 2000, the new college building was inaugurated in the presence of the former Quezon City Mayor Ishmael Mathay, together with Rev. Fr. Quirico T. Pedregosa Jr., O.P., former Provincial and Chair of the Board of Trustees. Rev. Fr. Hilario Q. Singian Jr. O.P. was installed as the 8th Rector of the College On October 2002, Rev. Fr. Hilario Q. Singian Jr. O.P. was installed as the 8th Rector of the College. During his term, the third floor of the St. Martin Building was constructed which housed the Home Study Program. Renovation of the St. Vincent Covered Court was also completed. Fr. Singian ended his term in 2004 and Fr. Herminio Dagohoy, OP succeeded him in June 2004. Improvement of facilities and offices was done like the air-conditioning of all the classrooms at St. Dominic Building and St Thomas Building. Renovations of all offices at the St. Martin Building (octagonal) were also done. He spearheaded the launching of the Solid Waste Management and the rehabilitation of the AC Football Field. In May 2008, Fr. Dagohoy was transferred to UST as one of the administrators of the UST Hospital. Fr. Ferdinand L. Bautista, OP succeeded him and was installed on June 12, 2008 as the 10th Rector and current President of Angelicum College. Silver anniversary On its Silver Anniversary in 1998, a musical play KULAYDOSKOP was presented. More than 3,000 learners from the Nursery to YS 11 Levels participated in the play which showcased the country’s heritage. Special programs In January 1999, Angelicum College formally launched the Re-entry Education Agenda for the Poor (REAP) Program. The launching ceremony was attended by no less than the President of the Philippines at that time, His Excellency President Joseph E. Estrada. Integration with University of Santo Tomas Logo prior integrating with UST. In academic year 2018-19, Angelicum College was renamed University of Santo Tomas – Angelicum College as per a memorandum of agreement signed on June 29, 2017. The renaming was part of plans to oversee and integrate with other Dominican educational institutions in the Philippines. The existing Board of Trustees of Angelicum was dissolved and a new one was formed composed of 12 members, 9 from UST Manila and 3 from Angelicum College but retained its independence in handling its own administrative and financial affairs.

Kristine Mann (August 29, 1873–1945) was an American educator and physician, with a particular interest in working women's health. She was an early practitioner of psychoanalysis in North America. Early life and education Kristine Mann was born August 29, 1873 in Orange, New Jersey. In 1885 Kristine and her family began spending summers at Bailey Island (Maine), a location that was reminiscent of her mother's native Denmark. Summering at Bailey Island would prove to be a lifelong ritual for Kristine. Kristine's education began at age four at the Dearborn Morgan School in Orange which she graduated from at age eighteen. In 1891 she entered Smith College receiving an A.B. in 1895. From there she returned to Orange where she helped her father as editor of the New Church Messenger, the official organ of the Swedenborgian General Convention. However, her father's conflicts with the New Church were deepening to the point that in 1897 ties were severed and Mann founded a new society in Elkhart, Indiana and a new periodical called The Secular Church. Mann was a follower of Henry James Sr., whose anti-ecclesiastical approach had brought him into conflict with the New Church in Chicago, resulting in the family moving to Orange. Thus Kristine grew up in a somewhat unorthodox New Church family setting. She began the study of anatomy at Women's Medical School in 1907 she entered Cornell Medical School receiving her medical degree in 1913. At Cornell she met Eleanor Bertine who would become a lifelong friend and colleague. Teaching career and interest in women's health Kristine Mann remained in Orange, teaching science at the Dearborn Morgan School. In 1899 she went to Berlin, Germany to teach English and ancient history in the Willard School for American Girls. She became proficient in German there and attended lectures in science and literature at the Berlin University. On her return home in 1900 she went to the University of Michigan where she received a Master of Arts degree. From there she went on to teach English for four years at Vassar College then several years in New York, New York teaching at the Brearley School while pursuing graduate studies in education, philosophy, and psychology at Columbia University. At this point in her career she became very concerned about women's health issues and came to believe strongly in better health education for women. She taught in the Physical Education Training School of Wellesley College, having charge of corrective exercises and freshman hygiene. In 1911 Mann had returned to New York to begin a two-year investigation of health conditions of saleswomen for the New York Department Store Education Association, and after the beginning of World War I joined the Ordnance Department supervising the health of women in munition plants. After the Armistice she joined the Work Council of the Y.W.C.A. where she traveled the United States lecturing and putting on health demonstrations at educational institutions. In 1920 she went on to become director of the Health Center for Business and Industrial Women in New York. Jungian Psychology At Vassar College Mann developed lifelong friendships with three of her students, Cary Fink, Elizabeth Goodrich and Eleanor Bertine, who like Mann, all played major roles in the early history of analytical psychology. In 1920 Bertine traveled to London, England to begin analysis with Constance Long, the first British psychoanalyst to follow Jung's methods. Long had studied with Jung at his home in Kusnacht, and this encounter lead Mann and Bertine to travel to Zürich from 1921-1922. They then returned to New York, New York where they established their own practices, becoming the second and third Jungians to treat patients in the United States. They became staunch allies of Jung and regularly traveled to Europe to attend his lectures and to continue their analysis with him. A small determined band of Jungians emerged in New York, and in 1924 Mary Esther Harding, a distinguished disciple of Jung, emigrated from England to join them. Beginning around 1918 Jung wrote that Christianity had suppressed the animal element in the human psyche, and as a result when it broke out it was uncontrolled and unregulated. This inevitably lead to catastrophe, such as with World War I. In 1923 after his interactions with Mann (1921–1922), Jung spoke of the historical effects of Ecclesiastical Christianity upon the unconscious mind. Jung's critique of Christianity was now limited to Ecclesiastical Christianity, which he now approached with greater scrutiny. Mann, Harding and Bertine spent summers at Mann's ancestral summer community at Bailey Island (Maine) where they established their practices in the summer and saw patients from all parts of the United States. In 1936 Jung traveled to Bailey Island to present his Bailey Island Seminar, the first of his two part American seminar Dream Symbols. The second part, known as his New York Seminar was held in New York one year later. The Dreamer in this seminar has been identified as the prominent physicist Wolfgang Pauli, and the seminars were published in volume 12 of Jung's Collected Works as Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy. The three women doctors created a powerful trio. In 1936 they created the Analytical Psychology Club of New York and actively lead the educational programs there. At her death in 1945 Mann left her personal library to the Club, the beginning of the Kristine Mann Library that is now the most extensive collection in analytical psychology in the world.

Also known as Db2 LUW for brevity, it is part of the Db2 family of database products. Db2 LUW is the \\"Common Server\\" product member of the Db2 family, designed to run on most popular operating systems. By contrast, all other Db2 products are specific to a single platform. On June 27, 2019, IBM released Db2 V11.5, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Database. It is both powered by and built for AI. The powered by AI component of Db2 11.5 is derived from features that replace manual optimization with Machine Learning based optimization, as well as the inclusion of natural language in the querying process. The built for AI attribute of Db2 11.5 pertains to the functionality included in Db2 11.5 to support AI application developers. Db2 11.5 is built for AI through the enhancements to support popular languages and frameworks used by AI developers; Db2 11.5 has native language support for Python, Ruby, Go, Java, PHP, Node.js and Sequelize, and it supports popular frameworks such as Visual Studio Code and Jupyter notebooks. Db2 11.5 is powered by AI since it includes features such as machine learning-based (ML) optimizer and Augmented Data Explorer (ADE). The ML Optimizer will supplement the existing cost-based optimizer. ADE uses natural language querying, faceted search and natural language generation capabilities to make it easy for users to easily explore the data stored in Db2. Db2 is part of the Hybrid Data Management Platform offering. This is a higher level of data management that enables all structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data to be accessed and analyzed, whether it is stored on premises, in a public cloud, in a private cloud, open source, or in any combination of those deployments. History The first release of Advanced Db2 LUW was as Db2 Universal Database version 5, available on UNIX, Windows and OS/2 platforms. This product stemmed from two earlier products, Db2 Common Server version 2 and Db2 Parallel Edition. Db2 Universal Database version 5 continued IBM's new direction of using a common code base to support Db2 on different platforms, while incorporating the shared nothing features of Db2 Parallel Edition to support large data warehousing databases. Db2 LUW was initially called Db2 Universal Database (UDB), but over time IBM marketing started to use the same term for other database products, notably mainframe (z-Series) Db2. Thus the Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows moniker became necessary to distinguish the common server Db2 LUW product from single-platform Db2 products. The current Db2 LUW product runs on multiple Linux and UNIX distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux, IBM AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, and most Windows systems. Earlier versions also ran on OS/2. Multiple editions are marketed for different sizes of organisation and uses. The same code base is also marketed without the Db2 name as IBM InfoSphere Warehouse edition. In 2017, the \\"Db2 UDB\\" name became just \\"Db2\\". Key features In addition to standard ACID- compliant row-organized relational database functionality, some of its key features are: * IBM BLU Acceleration: OLAP oriented column-organized tables, compressed with order-preserving \\"approximate Huffman encoding\\", exploiting SIMD vector processing of compressed data. Because the compression is order preserving, a greater range of operations can be performed on compressed data. * pureScale: A data-sharing clustering of the database over multiple servers for scalability and resilience. This technology was taken from the mainframe (z-Series) Db2 product. This form of clustering suits OLTP workloads. * Database partitioning feature: A shared-nothing approach to clustering, with data hashed across multiple partitions on the same server or different processors. With the right database design, this approach allows near-linear scaling. This form of clustering is generally employed for large data warehouses rather than OLTP workloads. * XML support: XML-specific storage and indexing, accessible by both SQL and also XQuery. * NoSQL support: Currently graph triple stores and JSON support * Storage Optimization * Data Federation * Federation Server * Continuous Data Ingest Editions IBM offers three editions: Db2 Community Edition, Standard Server Edition, and Advanced Server Edition. =IBM Db2 Community Edition= IBM Db2 Community Edition is a free to download, use and redistribute edition of the IBM Db2 data server, which has both XML database and relational database management system features. It is limited to four CPU cores, 16 GB of RAM, a database size of 100 GB, and no Enterprise support and fix packs. Db2 Community Edition has no limit on number of users. On June 27, 2019, IBM released Db2 V11.5, a Db2 update designed to deliver enhancements to help automate data management, eliminate ETL, and support artificial intelligence data workloads. Along with the update, IBM unveiled streamlined offerings. The free version of Db2 is the Community Edition. This version of Db2 contains all features, does not include an expiration. The caps on this version of Db2 is four CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM. IBM Db2 Community Edition replaces the Db2 Express edition. History On June 27, 2019, IBM announced a special free version of Db2 Database called Db2 Community edition. The Db2 Community edition was created for the 11.5 release of IBM Db2. The Db2 Community edition replaced the previously free version of IBM Db2 known as DB2 Express-C. On January 30, 2006, IBM announced a special free version of DB2 Express edition called DB2 Express-C. The DB2 Express-C edition was created for the 8.2 release of IBM Db2. After this Db2 Express-C was created for all new DB2 versions: 9.1 (codenamed \\"Viper\\"), 9.5 (codename \\"Viper 2\\"), 9.7 (codename \\"Cobra\\"), 10.01 (codename \\"Galileo\\"), 10.5 (codename \\"Kepler\\") and 11.1. The IBM DB2 pureXML implementation of XML database features was introduced in the beta of DB2 9. Supported environments The Community edition download is available for the following platforms: IBM Db2 11.5 Edition for AIX, IBM Db2 11.5 Edition for Windows on AMD64 and Intel EM64T systems (x64), IBM Db2 11.5 for Linux on AMD64 and Intel EM64T systems (x64), IBM Db2 11.5 for Linux on POWER little endian systems. There is also a Docker Image download available for the Community edition. Limitations IBM Db2 Community edition is limited to use up to 16 GB RAM and four CPU cores. The database engine does not limit the number of concurrent user connections. The prior version of IBM DB2 Express-C was limited to use up to 16 GB RAM (increase from 4 GB with v10.5) and two CPU cores. The Db2 Community edition feature set is similar to Db2 Standard and Advanced editions. The main difference is that the Community edition has lower CPU and memory limits, and is unsupported. It has the following extra features enabled: * Backup compression * Homogeneous federation only DB2, Informix Data Server and Oracle targets are supported * Homogeneous SQL replication * Net Search Extender * XML storage * Spatial extender Updates Db2 Community edition is unsupported and regular Db2 fix packs can not be applied to it. IBM does not release any fixes, but they do publish updated installation images and remove old ones. Unix versions need to be reinstalled, but it is possible to perform in-place updates on Windows versions by just running the installation program of a newer version. If you need access to regular Db2 fix packs, which are released several times per year, you need to buy Db2 Standard or Advanced editions. Installation images are traditionally refreshed once for every major Db2 release to sync code with second fix pack. Subscription For Db2 Community editions there are no annual subscriptions, instead the free trial is available indefinitely. Users who want to scale beyond four cores and 16 GB of RAM do not need to migrate their workload to an upgraded environment, instead users apply a license key against the existing implementation to access additional capacity. =IBM Db2 Standard Edition= The Db2 Standard Edition is available as a perpetual software license for production and non-production use for up to 16 processor cores and 128 GB RAM with IBM support. For production use, Db2 Standard Edition can be licensed based on a Virtual Processor Core metric, wherein it is licensed by the total count of processor cores in a non-partitioned physical server, or virtual cores assigned to a virtual server. For non-production use, Db2 Standard Edition can be licensed based on the total count of authorized users. =IBM Db2 Advanced Edition= The Db2 Advanced Edition is available only as a component of the IBM Hybrid Data Management Platform (HDMP). Within HDMP, Db2 is available both as a perpetual software license AND a monthly subscription for unrestricted production and non-production use with premium IBM support. For both HDMP perpetual license and subscription offerings, you need to buy FlexPoints. Flexpoints are generic licensing credits that can be used to deploy any Db2-family software product or cloud service offering. Db2 Advanced Edition offers these benefits: * Improves application performance and analytics for faster decisions. * Delivers high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. * Provides a secure, flexible environment * Interfaces with a variety of data more efficiently. * Improves productivity and reduces administration efforts.

She is a partner with her family in Castro Properties. In the early 1960s, she pursued a singing career with mild success. Castro recorded several singles, the 1964 \\"His Lips Get in the Way\\" among others. After earning her master's degree at the University of Florida, Bernadette worked in the advertising and promotions department of Castro Convertibles. While raising her four children, Bernadette worked in the business on a limited basis and later moved into her role as the company CEO when they were grown. In 2009 Bernadette bought back the Castro Convertibles furniture business with her family, relaunching the legendary brand with two all-new convertible ottomans designed for contemporary living. Real estate While Bernadette sold the furniture division of the family's company in 1993 to Krause Furniture,COMPANY NEWS; Castro Sofa Concern Sold By Family she retained ownership of the real estate and remained active in the family's commercial real estate business with properties along the East Coast. Terri Keogh, Bernadette's daughter, is CEO of Castro Properties. Bernadette's son Jonathan Austin is also in the family real estate business. Her son David Austin is a professional drummer. Her son Bernard Austin is an Architect. Castro Properties' flagship property is The Castro Building, which is located in Manhattan's Flatiron District at 43 West 23rd Street. Bernard Castro, founder of Castro Convertibles, purchased the property in 1972 and all eight floors were the well-known flagship showroom for Castro Convertibles. New York State Parks Commissioner In 1995, Bernadette was appointed Commissioner of the New York Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation by Governor George E. Pataki, a cabinet post she held for twelve years. During her tenure from 1995 to 2006, New York State preserved over one million acres of land through acquisition for state parks and conservation easements. Much of this was funded by a $1.75 billion environmental bond, which was authorized in 1996. Among her many accomplishments as Commissioner, Bernadette worked with Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Trust for Public Land in 1996 to acquire the 18,000 acre Sterling Forest property for $55 million. The property protects approximately 25% of New Jersey's drinking water. Sterling Forest II, an additional 1,065 acres, was purchased later in Castro's term for $8 million. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Bernadette the Vice Chair of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. In 2006, Castro established and strongly advocated an agreement by which Developer Donald J Trump would construct a $40 million seaside dining and banquet hall at Jones Beach. Hailed by Castro as “like a gift from God”, this plan to install a private facility at the heart of the Jones Beach boardwalk was in violation to the park's charter, and was widely opposed by the public. Trump's subsequent efforts to expand his facility proposal, coupled with increased opposition led to the project's cancellation. This Jones Beach site has since been occupied by a new public concession facility. The following year, Bernadette and her agency brought the United States Open Golf Championship to Bethpage State Park, the first time the Open was held at a public golf course. In accordance with the deal Castro struck with the US Open, the Golf Championship returned to Bethpage State Park in 2009. In 2003, the National Recreation and Park Association awarded New York State Parks, the National Gold Medal, designating them as the country's best state parks system. Also in 2003, the agency was recognized for its comprehensive efforts to save Governor's Island in New York City which was transferred from the federal government back to the people of New York. United States Senate run In 1994, Bernadette decided to pursue her passion for politics, running for the U.S. Senate and winning 42% of the votes against four-term Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. =1994 NYS Republican ticket= *Governor: George Pataki *Lieutenant Governor: Elizabeth McCaughey *Comptroller: Herbert London *Attorney General: Dennis Vacco *U.S. Senate: Bernadette Castro Awards Bernadette has been honored with a number of awards for her work in conservation, parks, business in including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Advancement of Commerce, Industry and Technology (ACIT) in 2009, the Lifetime Achievement Award from Long Island Business News in 2008, the Service Award for Land and Water Conservation Fund from the National Park Service in 2006, the Governor's Parks & Preservation Award, presented by Governor George Pataki in 2005, the Women in Conservation Award from the National Audubon Society in 2005, the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for Conservation from The History Channel in 2003, the Cornelius Amory Pugsley Award, from the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration in association with The National Park Foundation in 2002, the Theodore Roosevelt Legacy of Conservation Award in 2001, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1999, as well as being inducted into the Long Island Hall of Fame in 1990.

Background  In July 1879, Stevenson received word that his future American wife's divorce was almost complete, but that she was seriously ill. He left Scotland right away and travelled to meet her in Monterey, California, (his trip detailed in The Amateur Emigrant (1894) and Across the Plains (1892)). Broken financially, suffering from a lifelong fibrinous bronchitis condition, and with his writing career at a dead end, he was nursed back to health by his doctor, his nurse, and his future wife, while living briefly in Monterey, San Francisco, and Oakland. His father having provided money to help, on May 19, 1880, he married the Indianapolis native, whom he had first met in France in 1875, soon after the events of An Inland Voyage. Still too weak to undertake the journey back to Scotland, friends suggested Calistoga, in the upper Napa Valley, with its healthy mountain air. = Summary = The couple first went to the Hot Springs Hotel in Calistoga, but unable to afford the 10 dollars a week fee, they spent an unconventional honeymoon in an abandoned three-story bunkhouse at a derelict mining camp called \\"Silverado\\" on the shoulder of Mount Saint Helena in the Mayacama Mountains. There they squatted for two months during summer, putting up makeshift cloth windows and hauling water in by hand from a nearby stream while dodging rattlesnakes and the occasional fog banks so detrimental to Stevenson's health. The Silverado Squatters provides some views of California during the late 19th century. Stevenson uses the first telephone of his life. He meets a number of wine growers in Napa Valley, an enterprise he deems \\"experimental\\", with growers sometimes even mislabeling the bottles as originating from Spain in order to sell their product to skeptical Americans. He visits the oldest wine grower in the valley, Jacob Schram, who had been experimenting for 18 years at his Schramsberg Winery, and had recently expanded the wine cellar in his backyard. Stevenson also visits a petrified forest owned by an old Swedish ex-sailor who had stumbled upon it while clearing farmland—the precise nature of the petrified forest remained for everyone a source of curiosity. Stevenson also details his encounters with a local Jewish merchant, whom he compares to a character in a Charles Dickens novel (probably Fagin from Oliver Twist), and portrays as happy-go-lucky but always scheming to earn a dollar. Like Dickens in American Notes (1842), Stevenson found the American habit of spitting on the floor hard to get used to. His experiences at Silverado were recorded in a journal he called \\"Silverado Sketches\\", parts of which he incorporated into Silverado Squatters in 1883 while living in Bournemouth, England, with other tales appearing in \\"Essays of Travel\\" and \\"Across the Plains\\". Many of his notes on the scenery around him later provided much of the descriptive detail for Treasure Island (1883).  Legacy  The Robert Louis Stevenson State Park now encompasses the area where the Stevensons stayed. The entrance to the park is at the summit of State Route 29. A new trail has been constructed in recent years. The \\"Silverado Museum\\" in St. Helena, California, is dedicated to Stevenson.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 Feb. 2013 No one knows for certain when Fergus was born or where. He was a contemporary of St. Drostan and St. Donevaldus. The name is of Pictish origin and he is recorded as Fergus, a Pictish bishop, so it is generally considered he was from the north east of what is now called Scotland. In the Aberdeen Breviary he is called Fergustian and \\"he occupied himself in converting the barbarous people.\\" He is thought to have trained in Ireland or the south of Scotland, possibly both.\\"St. Fergus Cruithneach\\", Glamis Inverarity Kinnettles Kirk Known in the Irish martyrologies as St. Fergus Cruithneach, or the Pict, the Breviary of Aberdeen states that he had been a bishop for many years in Ireland when he went on a mission to Alba with some chosen priests and other clerics. He settled first near Strageath, in Upper Strathearn, in Upper Perth, and erected three churches in that district. The churches of Strageath, Blackford, and Dolpatrick are found there dedicated to St. Patrick. He next evangelized Caithness and established there the churches of WickWick St. Fergus Church of Scotland and Halkirk. St Fergus Well, Glamis The church Fergus built at Glamis would have been in the Celtic \\"mud and wattle\\" style, not far from the present kirk. He may have been the Fergustus Pictus who went to Rome in 721, but such a contention relies solely on the similarity of a common name. He died about 730 and was buried at Glamis, Angus, where the recently restored St Fergus' Well can be visited. The village church at Eassie is dedicated to Saint Fergus; the noted Pictish Eassie Stone has been moved to that church.C.Michael Hogan, Eassie Stone, The Megalithic Portal, ed.

Film *Star Wars (1977), features Obi Wan Kenobi telling Luke Skywalker that Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father), was betrayed and killed by Darth Vader. The sequel film The Empire Strikes Back (1980), plot has Vader reveal himself as Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father). George Lucas decided to merge both characters while writing The Empire Strikes Back. The following film Return of the Jedi (1983) has Obi-Wan, justifying his original description of Vader having 'murdered' Anakin, as being truth from \\"a certain point of view\\" because from his point of view when Anakin became Vader he destroyed everything that was good about his former friend and apprentice. Similarly Princess Leia had been previously set as an upper-class romantic interest for the farm boy Luke; but in Empire Strikes Back Leia falls in love with Han Solo, so in order to avoid a possible love triangle, Return of the Jedi reveals Leia as Luke Skywalker's twin sister (and therefore, daughter of Darth Vader), Lucas had originally planned Luke's sister to be a separate character, before deciding to accommodate it into the already established Leia. Rogue One (2016) explains the improbable vulnerability of the Death Star in A New Hope to small rebel ships as a consequence of deliberate sabotage on the part of the key Death Star architect. *Creed (2015) the seventh entry of the Rocky film series which serves as a sequel and spin-off to 2006's Rocky Balboa (the sixth film), contains a major change into the continuity of the previous films. Creed establishes that during the events of Rocky IV, Rocky's friend and rival Apollo Creed had an affair that resulted in a woman's pregnancy shortly before his boxing match against Ivan Drago during which Apollo dies on the ring. Months after the fight, the woman gives birth to Adonis \\"Donnie\\" Creed, the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Donnie never meets his father and is the protagonist of the film Creed; furthermore the film reveals Apollo won the fight at the end of Rocky III implying that that is the reason why Apollo agreed to fight Ivan Drago. *In the Heisei and Millennium eras of the Godzilla film series, the events of the Showa era after the original film never happened. In particular, each film in the Millennium series – except for Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S., which serves as the direct sequel to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla – serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film. *In Iron Man 2, Jon Favreau's son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. This was retroactively made the introduction of a young Peter Parker to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider- Man actor Tom Holland, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts. *In a flashback scene of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales it is revealed that Jack Sparrow's compass was given to him by the former captain of Wicked Wench. However in the second installment of the franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Tia Dalma said that the compass was bartered by Jack from her. Moreover, the majority of the plotlines of the previous movie Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides were totally dismissed, leaving only the Black Pearl in the bottle. The fleet in the bottles of Blackbeard stolen by Mr. Gibbs never appears nor be mentioned in the movie. Will Turner's being as a captain of the Flying Dutchman is never previously referred as a curse, but a kind of a work. Originally, it has been planned that Will Turner will serve on a Dutchman only 10 years, after which he returns to Elizabeth, as it is seen the post-credit scene of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. This has been changed due to the introduction of the son of Will Turner, Henry, who wants to break the curse. The daughter of Hector Barbossa Carina Smyth could not exist in the continuity of the franchise. Carina's age is approximately that of Henry's, who is 21. Despite this, during the events of the third installment, there was no mention of the lover of Barbossa named Margaret. It is shown in the movie that Jack Sparrow knows her name, which could not happen, because Jack doesn't see Barbossa until the events of the fourth movie, which is set in 1750, while the following movie is set only five years after this. Literature *When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle killed off his character Sherlock Holmes by plunging him to his death over the Reichenbach Falls with his nemesis Professor Moriarty, the public's demand for Holmes was so great that Doyle was compelled to bring him back to life in a subsequent story, where he details that Holmes had merely faked his death. *Though the term \\"retcon\\" did not yet exist when George Orwell wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four, the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that \\"Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally\\" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change \\"all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs\\" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. \\"Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.\\" See historical revisionism (negationism). Television *In 2004, Coronation Street retconned the Baldwin family after Mike Baldwin's nephew Danny and wife Frankie moved to the area from Essex, with their two sons Jamie and Warren. Mike had been portrayed as an only child prior to this moment, with his father appearing in the program between 1980 and 1982 to confirm the notion. *First of the Summer Wine, the prequel to the long-running British sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, retconned the character Seymour Utterthwaite as a pre-World War II friend of the other central characters. Seymour had been introduced into later series of Last of the Summer Wine and was previously unknown to the stalwart characters, Compo and Clegg. *The revived series of British science fiction television program Doctor Who and its television spin-offs use retroactive continuity as a plot device. **Show runner Steven Moffat's fifth series finale depicted the Doctor rebooting the universe. In answer to a fan's question, Moffat tweeted: \\"The whole universe came exactly as it was. Except for any continuity errors I need to explain away.\\" **In the sixth series, Moffat introduces new aliens the Silence, who erase your memory of them the moment you look away. Commenting on this device, writer MaryAnn Johanson writes, \\"That could be happening throughout this story... indeed, through the entire history of Doctor Who. Moffat has just created a pretty much unassailable narratively sound reason for inserting retcons anywhere throughout the half-century history of the show.\\" **In the seventh series finale, Moffat creates a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". He is shown in the mini- episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between the Eighth and Ninth Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. **In the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", Moffat revealed, that at the last instant of the Time War, the Doctor hid his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it. ** In the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, created by Russell T Davies, a drug used to erase the memory of characters is called \\"retcon\\"; the use of the drug is often referred to by characters as \\"retconning\\". Video games *The chronology of The Legend of Zelda series was subject to much debate among fans until an official timeline was printed in the collector's book Hyrule Historia, released in Japan on December 21, 2011. Hyrule Historia contains a timeline that explains how each game fits within the storyline. This includes introducing a three-way split after Ocarina of Time. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword helps explain the appearance of multiple Zelda, Link and Ganondorf characters across hundreds of years. *The original Ninja Gaiden trilogy for the NES was followed years later by a new series of sequels produced by Team Ninja beginning with Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox in 2004. However, the second generation of Ninja Gaiden video games, being prequels to original series has many differences from the NES trilogy. The character design of Ryu Hayabusa in the new games is now based on the Dead or Alive incarnation of the character with long hair and green eyes, the character design of Ryu's father, Ken Hayabusa, has been updated as well, the character now being addressed in the English versions by his original name in the Japanese versions (Jo Hayabusa), and producer Tomonobu Itagaki hints at the possibility that Sonia, a character from the new games, might be Irene Lew from the original series. With the release of Dead or Alive: Dimensions in 2011, it has been revealed that Sonia is indeed Irene Lew. *In Metal Gear, the character Big Boss serves as Solid Snake's commanding officer and is apparently revealed near the end of the game to also be the main antagonist. However, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain establishes the antagonist character to actually be a body double of the real Big Boss, called Venom Snake, who is killed by Solid Snake during this encounter. The original Big Boss later becomes the antagonist in the series' second entry, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. *In the ending of 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic and Elise blow out the flame of Solaris, undoing all changes made by Iblis and causing the entire story to never happen; thus undoing all the inconsistencies the game's plot caused. Ignored sequels in various media *The film Superman Returns continues the storylines of Superman and Superman II, and ignoring the events of Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. *Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist Michael Myers, nor does it include story elements from either Halloween (1978) or Halloween II (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as fictional films, as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. The film Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) is a direct sequel to Halloween and Halloween II, dismissing the events that take place in the sequels Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995). The subsequent film Halloween: Resurrection (2002) follows the new continuity of Halloween H20; however, it retcons that film's ending in order to do so. The 2018 film Halloween is a direct sequel to the original film while disregarding the other sequels, and retconing the ending of the first film. *The film The Exorcist III is a sequel to The Exorcist, and ignores the events of Exorcist II: The Heretic. *Highlander II: The Quickening is a sequel to the first film, but its events are ignored by later films in the series. Similarly, Highlander: Endgame ignores the events of both Highlander II and Highlander III: The Sorcerer and only follows the events of the TV series and the first film. *Texas Chainsaw 3D and its prequel Leatherface follow the continuity of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, ignoring the events of the other sequels. *The fifth film in the Terminator series, Terminator Genisys (2015), completely disregards the events of the third and fourth Terminator films, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) and Terminator Salvation (2009). Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) disregards the third, fourth, and fifth films, with only the original 1984 film and the first sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) considered canon. *Jaws: The Revenge, the fourth film in the Jaws franchise, is a direct sequel to Jaws 2 and ignores the events of Jaws 3-D. *Zeta Gundam: A New Translation, a film compilation retelling of the TV series, while having a similar ending, includes elements that intentionally leave no plausible room for the events of ZZ Gundam. *Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, the eighth main installment in the Crash Bandicoot series, is a direct sequel to Crash Bandicoot: Warped and ignores the events of every post- Naughty Dog game.

He stood to inherit much of her estates in Wales on the Welsh Marches, and in Gloucestershire at Painswick. She had fought long and hard to enfranchise her son for the duration of the Berkeley feud, in which the young nobleman's manor house was raided by Lord Berkeley's brothers. After 1449, his mother was one of three co-heiresses to her father, and through her he possessed a claim on Berkeley Castle. In 1451, already a veteran of the fight at St Barnets Green, he was created Viscount Lisle. In prosecution of the claim against James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley, the heir- male, he stormed Berkeley Castle in 1452 and took the Baron and his sons prisoner. Ordered to recruit reinforcements for the English army in France, he found 2325 men at Dartmouth and Plymouth before embarkation on 5 March 1453. He was joined by the Lords Moleyns and Camoys, as he led troops into Guyenne to reinforce his father. They sailed to Bordeaux but still the English army numbered only 8,000, facing an enemy force of 10,000. They were still awaiting reinforcements when they marched out, capturing an outpost at St Laurent on 17 July 1453. That day they fought the last pitched battle of the Hundred Years' War at Castillon. Both father and son were killed during the battle.

He was the son of a revolutionary officer, Thomas Macdonough, Sr. who lived near Middletown, Delaware. He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside. He entered naval life at an early age, receiving a midshipman's commission at the age of sixteen.Lewis, 1924 p.163 Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli, he was a member of \\"Preble's Boys\\", a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War.

Macdonough was a tall, dignified man with a commanding character which suited him well for military service. He was a devoutly religious man of Episcopal faith, as were his parents and greater family. He was known to adhere to a set of steadfast principles in his personal and military life.Frost, 1845 p.304Macdonough, 1909 p.11.

Shortly before Philadelphia ran aground and was consequently captured by the Tripolitans, Macdonough had gone ashore on leave.Skaggs, 2006 p.41 He was reassigned on October 31 to the 12-gun sloop under the command of Lieutenant Stephen Decatur. Macdonough volunteered to join Decatur's successful raid into the harbor of Tripoli. On February 6, 1804, they succeeded in burning and destroying Philadelphia. Having just served on Philadelphia, Macdonough's familiarity made his role in the operation a crucial one. For his heroic actions he was promoted to acting Lieutenant.MacKenzie, 1846 pp.67-68 Macdonough also accompanied Decatur when they hunted down the murderer of Decatur's brother, James Decatur, who was killed by the commander when he boarded a Tripolitan ship that had pretended to be surrendering. After catching up with and pulling alongside the ship involved, Decatur was the first to board the enemy vessel with Midshipman Macdonough at his heels along with nine volunteer crew members. Decatur, Macdonough and the rest of the crew were outnumbered 5 to 1 but were determined, organized and kept their form, fighting furiously side by side, killing the commander and most of the crew along with capturing the Tripolitan ship.Abbot, W. John, 1886 Other service After winning promotion to Lieutenant for his participation in the raid on Philadelphia, Macdonough served aboard the 18-gun brig , the same vessel assisting at Tripoli. Assisting Isaac Hull, he then supervised the construction of several gunboats in Middletown, Connecticut. In January 1806, Macdonough was promoted to a commission of Lieutenant. As commander of the 18-gun , Macdonough served patrolling waters near Great Britain and various points in the Mediterranean. He returned to America and enforced the Embargo Act, and the Atlantic blockade, from 1807 and 1808. In 1809, he served with Captain Smith aboard , but later requested reassignment. Macdonough returned to Middletown, Connecticut, and was placed in charge of the several gunboats there. In Middletown Macdonough met his future wife, Ann Shaler. With the repeal of the Embargo Act, the role of the navy became less active, with a fifth of its officers away on furlough at half pay. Macdonough remained in Middleton for only eight months before requesting a furlough in June 1810. From 1810 to 1812, Macdonough took a leave of absence for two years as the captain of a British merchantman that was en route to India.Skaggs, 2006, p.53 War of 1812 At the beginning of the War of 1812 American naval forces were very small, allowing the British to make many advances into the Great Lakes and northern New York waterways. The roles played by commanders like Oliver Hazard Perry at Lake Erie and Isaac Chauncey at Lake Ontario and Thomas Macdonough at Lake Champlain all proved vital to the naval effort on the lakes that was largely responsible for preserving American territory during that war. Assigned to USS Constellation, as First Lieutenant, Macdonough returned to active service just prior to the outbreak of the war in June 1812. The ship at this time was being outfitted and supplied in Washington, DC, for its next mission, but was still months away from being ready. Moreover, it did not escape from the British blockade at the Chesapeake Bay until 1814.Malcomson, 2006 p.45 Requesting transfer to a more active front, Macdonough was assigned the command of a squadron of gunboats defending Portland, Maine. His stay there was brief when he received new orders from Secretary of the Navy Hamilton. Macdonough was reassigned to Burlington, Vermont to command U.S. naval forces in Lake Champlain in October 1812.Heidler, 2004 p.312 Taking leave from his assignment at Lake Champlain Macdonough married Lucy Anne Shaler on December 12, 1812, at the Christ Church in Middletown by Bishop Abraham Jarvis.Skaggs, 2006 p.56 On June 2, 1813, Macdonough sent Lieutenant Sidney Smith with , along with Sailing Master Loomis with , to guard against British advances at the Canada–US border at the Richelieu River. The impatient Smith sailed into British waters, an action which was contrary to his orders, and at once found himself overpowered by the British squadron. After enduring four hours of battle, Smith was finally forced into surrendering. =Lake Champlain Campaign= On July 24, 1813, Macdonough was promoted to the rank of master commandant. When the war began in 1812, there were only two American naval vessels on Lake Champlain, and , each carrying ten guns with a crew of fifty. On June 3, 1813, the two vessels were pursuing a British gunboat but were caught up in a strong current that prevented them from maintaining their heading and position, giving the advantage to British forces, resulting in their capture. The loss of the two and only American vessels on the lake gave undisputed control of this strategic waterway to the British. This prompted Macdonough to begin the construction of the corvette and new sloop and several gunboats at the shipyard in Otter Creek at Vergennes, Vermont. While construction was underway, , a schooner, was being converted to a warship carrying seventeen guns.Heidler, 2004 p.269 In 1814 the ice covering Lake Champlain, which usually lasted well into May, began melting and breaking up early in April. Macdonough feared that the British, who he assumed by now knew of the ship construction going on there, would use the opportunity to capture or destroy the vessels being built. Having learned of Macdonough's ship building activity, the British constructed a heavily armed brig and five large gunboats at 'Isle Aux Noix' over the winter.Malcomson, 2006 p.150 As Macdonough had predicted, British forces attempted to navigate the lake. Because of unfavorable winds, the British commander Daniel Pring, whose forces were based at Isle Aux Noix in upper Lake Champlain, didn't complete the 65-mile journey to Otter Creek until May 14. Upon arrival, Pring situated his squadron in the lake just off Otter Creek with eight galleys and a bomb sloop, preventing the American forces' passage north and to the sea.Mahon 1909, p. 320.Malcomson, 2006 p.404 For one hour, Commander Pring maintained a heavy fire. However, Macdonough had learned of the attack beforehand from his observers on land and had prepared a defense in anticipation of this likely event. Using the guns of his ships, he had them landed on shore at the mouth of Otter Creek. Macdonough constructed an artillery battery with which he repelled the attack and drove the Royal Navy back to Isle Aux Noix in Canadian waters by autumn. With the way now clear, Macdonough's squadron sailed out of Otter Creek and made its way to Plattsburgh, New York, where it anchored just off shore in anticipation of the next and inevitable British advance.Maclay, 1894 pp. 26–28 =Battle of Plattsburgh= Macdonough's Saratoga (left) and Eagle (right) engaging Confiance. By late August 1814, approximately 10,000 British troops under the command of George Prevost had assembled near Montreal at the Canada–US border. Many of these soldiers were well-trained, regular troops who served under Wellington, already battle hardened from their recent defeat of Napoleon in Europe. Macdonough had little naval combat experience. His service in the Barbary wars was limited to gunboat actions and the capture and destruction of Philadelphia. He had yet to experience a ship-to-ship action, being on a vessel that was receiving broadsides, surrounded by dead and wounded men. Regardless of this lack in experience, Macdonough well understood that defending and holding Plattsburgh, thus not allowing General Macomb's troops to be surrounded by British forces on land and water, was vital to winning the war.Skaggs, 2006 p.123 On September 3, Prevost's army crossed the border and marched into northern New York State, advancing on Plattsburgh. The city was held by General Macomb with less than 2,000 regular troops, with the support of the New York militia, under the command of General Mooers and the Vermont volunteers, under the command of General Strong.Holden, 1914, p. 20. However, Prevost who had arrived in earnest was yet aware of enemy strength and positions and refused to march on the city itself without adequate naval support to divert the American forces. A squadron under the command of Commodore George Downie sailed southward into the open lake to engage the American fleet commanded by Macdonough. In anticipation of the British fleet, Macdonough strategically positioned and anchored his fleet a short distance off shore from Plattsburgh and made further preparations for Downie's advance.Maclay, 1894 pp.26-28 On September 11, Downie's forces departed from Isle-aux-Noix and sailed southward along the Richelieu River into Lake Champlain.Roosevelt, 1889 p.376 Upon encountering Macdonough's fleet waiting in Plattsburgh harbor, Downie immediately attacked, achieving the upper hand early in the battle, largely because of the great firepower of the 36-gun British flagship . As the battle unfolded, the British squadron incurred considerable damage from close-range cannon fire. In the process an American cannon shot blasted a British cannon off its mount, crushing and killing Downie.Lewis, 1924 p.175 Through use of anchor and cable tactics, Macdonough in command of was able to swing his ship around the undamaged side of the British flagship, gaining firepower superiority over the British fleet. As the poorly and hurriedly equipped Confiance with its inexperienced crew attempted the same tactic, Macdonough seized the opportunity and fired a broadside, severely damaging the British vessel and forcing its surrender.Heidler, 2004 pp.160, 290Malcomson, 2006 p.149 Having removed the British flagship from action, the American forces captured or destroyed the remaining larger ships in the fleet. Both commanders would have seen the parallels of Macdonough's anchorage on Lake Champlain to that of the French under Vice Admiral Francois-Paul Brueys, opposing British Rear Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, at the Battle of the Nile in Aboukir Bay on August 1, 1798. A study of Nelson's battles was part of the professional knowledge expected of naval commanders. But Macdonough did all that Brueys did not. He expected to take advantage of the prevailing winds on Lake Champlain that constrained Downie's axis of approach. \\"Because nearly every circumstance that worked to Nelson's advantage proved disadvantageous to Downie, the Battle of Lake Champlain is sometimes called the False Nile\\" by the English.Potter and Nimitz, 1960 p. 221. The British naval historian William Laird Clowes regarded Macdonough's False Nile victory as \\"a most notable feat, one which, on the whole, surpassed that of any other captain of either navy in this war.\\"Quoted in Hagan, p. 88 Clowes echoed Roosevelt's view, \\"The British sailors on the lakes were as good as our own, but no better. None of their commanders compare with Macdonough.\\"Roosevelt, 1889 p.280 After the battle, Macdonough returned to the British officers their swords. Captain Pring wrote: Upon wresting control of Lake Champlain from the British, Macdonough's victory forced the British forces to retire to Canada, the actions of which left no grounds for any claims by the British for any territory when the Ghent peace conference convened on December 24. For his success in forcing the retreat of Prevost into Canada, Macdonough was duly promoted to the rank of Captain. He was also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal at this time.Lewis, 1924 pp.191-184 He was also awarded by the State of New York a thousand acres of land in Cayuga county, with another hundred acres awarded to him from the State of Vermont, making the once modest commodore a wealthy man.Hickey, 1989 p. 193. Later days , painted 1934 Macdonough relieved Isaac Hull of command of the Portsmouth Navy Yard on July 1, 1815. In command there for three years, he returned to the Mediterranean Squadron in 1818 and was appointed commander of , a frigate of 44 guns and later transported Hon. G.W. Campbell to the Court of St. Petersburg in Russia stopping in ports in England, Elsineur and Copenhagen along the way.Macdonough, 1909 pp.30-31 In April Macdonough was stricken with tuberculosis but he still remained on duty for as long as possible. After returning to America later in the year, he was given command of a ship of the line, bearing 74 guns under construction in New York harbor. From 1818 to 1823 Macdonough served as her captain.Lewis, 1924 p.129 In the fall of 1822 Macdonough toured western New York State visiting Niagara Falls and then battling the rapids sailed down the St. Lawrence River to Quebec in a batteauxMacdonough, 1909 p.32 After submitting several requests for active sea duty, Macdonough received command of the 44-gun frigate in 1824. However, his health continued to worsen. On October 14, 1825, Macdonough had to relieve himself of his command. On October 14 he turned command of Constitution over to Captain Daniel T. Patterson at Gibraltar. Intending to return to New York, Macdonough departed the Mediterranean in the merchant brig . The day before his death, in the presence of Dr. Turk, Macdonough drew up and signed a will leaving a small sum of money to his servant, his wife having died several months beforehand. On November 10, 1825, Thomas Macdonough died aboard ship while it was passing Gibraltar.Macdonough, 1909 pp.249-251Skaggs, 2003 p.xix Macdonough's body was returned to the United States and was buried in Middletown, Connecticut. He was laid to rest alongside his wife Ann Shaler, a lady of a prominent family in Middletown, she having died just a few months earlier.Skaggs, 2006 p.201 Legacy USS Macdonough, 1900 Decatur ~ Macdonough U.S. postage, Navy Issue of 1937 * Several U.S. Navy ships have been named in his honor. * In 1937, at the urging of Franklin D.

It is usually a nonprogressive disease and can be caused by viral infections, drugs, vitamin A deficiency, or genetic defects. Retinal dysplasia is characterized by folds or rosettes (round clumps) of the retinal tissue. Retinal dysplasia in dogs Most cases of retinal dysplasia in dogs are hereditary. It can involve one or both retinas. Retinal dysplasia can be focal, multifocal, geographic, or accompanied by retinal detachment. Focal and multifocal retinal dysplasia appears as streaks and dots in the central retina. Geographic retinal dysplasia appears as an irregular or horseshoe- shaped area of mixed hyper or hyporeflectivity in the central retina. Retinal detachment occurs with complete retinal dysplasia, and is accompanied by blindness in that eye. Cataracts or glaucoma can also occur secondary to retinal dysplasia. Other causes of retinal dysplasia in dogs include infection with canine adenovirus or canine herpesvirus, or radiation of the eye in newborns. =Commonly affected breeds= *Bedlington Terrier - complete retinal dysplasia. *Sealyham Terrier - complete retinal dysplasia. *Rottweiler - focal or multifocal. *English Springer Spaniel - focal, multifocal, or geographic. *American Cocker Spaniel - focal or multifocal. *Beagle - focal or multifocal. *Cavalier King Charles Spaniel - retinal folds, geographic, or retinal detachment. *Labrador Retriever - focal, multifocal, geographic, or complete retinal dysplasia.

Early life, education, and military service Born in St. Joseph, Missouri, he moved with his parents to Yuma County, Colorado in 1887. He settled in Denver in 1889, and attended the public schools and Sacred Heart College of Denver (now called Regis University). During the Spanish–American War, he commanded a company in the Philippine campaign of 1899, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Means \\"distinguished himself before the fall of Manila by swimming the Singalon river to reconnoiter the Spanish works\\", escaping capture when he was spotted. Returning from the war, he expressed a desire for the United States to permanently incorporate the Philippines, envisioning Manila surpassing Hong Kong as a trading center. In 1901, he graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Denver. From 1902 to 1904, he was county judge of Adams County, and in 1908 was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Sixty-first United States Congress. Following this defeat, he was appointed deputy district attorney for Adams County, Colorado. Means was elected commander-in-chief of the Army of the Philippines in 1913, and of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1914. He served during the First World War as a lieutenant colonel and commandant of the Fortieth Division School of Arms. He commanded the 4th Infantry in the Meuse–Argonne offensive. Means ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1920, losing the Republican nomination to Samuel D. Nicholson, who would go on to win the seat. He was attorney for the City and County of Denver in 1923 and 1924. Political career and later life Means was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate on November 4, 1924, in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by Nicholson's death. During the campaign, his Democratic opponent nicknamed him \\"Puffed Rice\\", but this did not hinder Means' election. Means was one of several candidates reported to have benefited from the support of the state's Ku Klux Klan organization.\\"Klan Candidates Lead in Colorado\\", St. Louis Globe-Democrat (September 10, 1924), p. 5. He served in the Senate from December 1, 1924, to March 3, 1927, chairing the Committee on Claims (Sixty-ninth Congress). During his tenure, he authored legislation deeming Armistice Day (later called Veterans Day) a national holiday in the United States. During this time, Means also became directing head of the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado. In 1926 he was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection, as he was again defeated in the Republican primary, this time by Charles W. Waterman, who \\"rode to victory on the wave of anti-klan sentiment\\". In 1926 and 1927, Means was commander in chief of the United Spanish War Veterans, and in 1927 he became president of the National Tribune Corporation and publisher of the National Tribune and Stars and Stripes in Washington, D.C. In response to the enactment of the initial New Deal measures in 1933, Means fiercely criticized the FDR administration declaring it to have been \\"conceived by income-tax dodgers\\" and \\"born of ruthless, vicious propaganda\\", and calling it \\"a stain upon the honor of the United States\\". Means retired in 1937, and died in Denver on January 30, 1949, following a six-month bout with heart problems. He was interred in Denver's Fairmount Cemetery.

With his first band, The Happy Farmers, he opened shows for such Dallas Deep Ellum faves of the era as the New Bohemians, Ten Hands, and Fever in the Funkhouse at Club Dada. But by age 18, he won a classical guitar scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin. Garza had met Austinites Chris Searles and Jeff Haley through scholastic music events in high school. They christened themselves Twang Twang Shock-A-Boom and headed to the West Mall of the UT campus, armed with acoustic guitar, upright bass and bongos. The acoustic three-piece band “went from playing the West Mall on the University of Texas campus for fun and tips to packing a thousand or so fans into Liberty Lunch and showcasing at the headquarters of CBS Records (now Sony Music)”. After leaving the group Twang Twang Shock A Boom to go solo, Garza formed a new band and gigged continually around and outside the Texas area, billed as David Garza & The Lovebeads and later as DAH-VEED. In the mid-1990s he had his brush with the major-label world, signing with Lava/Atlantic, but eventually returned to his street-performer roots, releasing nearly an album a year since. Garza released a flurry of solo cassettes and CDs, selling them for $5 and $10, respectively. He called this the “Single Bill Theory,” one he maintains to the present day. Garza performed tirelessly on the regional club and college circuit, ultimately striking a major-label deal, in 1996. Initially, Garza rebuffed various major label recording offers, choosing instead to record and distribute music on his own label, Wide Open Records. After independently releasing nine records and selling 30,000 copies on his own,\\"Run With It - David Garza's having a ball with This Euphoria\\" Texas Monthly he eventually signed with Lava/Atlantic and was featured on the Great Expectations soundtrack. His major-label debut, This Euphoria, followed in April 1998. He took over production duties for his second Lava/Atlantic record, 2001's Overdub, and brought in Will Calhoun and Doug Wimbish, the drummer and bassist of Living Colour as his backup band for the sessions. Juliana Hatfield contributed backing vocals on the song \\"Keep On Crying.\\" In 1999, at the height of his touring popularity, Garza was voted 2nd behind Stevie Ray Vaughan as Austin Musician of the Decade (Austin Chronicle). In 2011, the City of Austin, TX declared May 12 “David Garza Day.” Soon after, to celebrate what would've been Elliott Smith's 44th birthday on August 6th, 2013, Smith’s family entrusted Garza to “host a bicoastal tribute to the late pop mystic.” In subsequent years, Garza has returned to releasing his music independently and plays frequently in Texas and in Los Angeles. A series of residency shows at L.A.'s Club Largo showcased his skill as a solo performer on both piano and guitar. During Garza's live shows, artists as highly regarded as producer/soundtrack icon Jon Brion, Nickel Creek, Grant Lee Phillips and Fiona Apple regularly sat in with him. Garza has shared the stage with the likes of Jackson Browne, John Paul Jones, Los Lobos, Pearl Jam, St. Vincent, Meshell Ndegeocello, Andrew Bird, Natalia LaFourcade, Chris Thile, Ben Harper. He has also done extensive work as a producer and session musician, composer, and visual artist. In 2020 he was a musician on, co- produced and created the album artwork for the acclaimed Fiona Apple release Fetch The Bolt Cutters. Collaborations Throughout his career, David Garza has done studio and live session work for a number of artists. He contributed guitar and production to Juliana Hatfield's Beautiful Creature in 2000, and toured as keyboardist for Alejandro Escovedo in 2001. The same year, he played on the soundtrack for the film Spy Kids. In 2002, he worked with Rhett Miller on The Instigator, and in 2004 he appeared on Hanson's record Underneath. In 2005, he toured with Fiona Apple on her Extraordinary Machine tour, performing both as the opening act and as a guitarist in her backing band.Variety[ Allmusic] In 2006, Garza played baritone guitar on the Revolting Cocks Cocked and Loaded LP, and Al Jourgensen later added vocals to “Minority Boys Got $” on Garza’s 2008 album Dream Delay. Garza played guitar and sang back-up vocals on the 2007 John Legend single “Sun Comes Up”. Since 2008, Garza has regularly toured and recorded with Gaby Moreno. David performed the music on comedian, actress, and singer-songwriter Marget Cho’s 2016 album American Myth. In 2020, Garza was a guest vocalist and piano player on the Watkins Family Hour studio album entitled Brother Sister, joining Gaby Moreno and John C. Reilly on a cover of Charley Jordan’s “Keep It Clean.”  Composing and production  Garza contributed music on film scores for Wretches & Jabberers (2011), Garnet’s Gold (2014), and Racing Extinction (2015).

During the early 20th century, \\"running north from Market Street to the Barbary Coast, Kearny Street was an avenue of honky-tonks and saloons frequented by racetrack tipsters and other shady professionals. On election nights it was the scene of torch-light parades and brass bands\\", as summarized in the 1940 WPA guide to San Francisco. From the turn of the twentieth century until 1977, the area around the intersection of Kearny and Jackson Streets was home to a large Filipino population, and earned the nickname Manilatown. Located at 848 Kearny Street, the International Hotel served as the heart of Manilatown. In its heyday of the 1920s and 1930s the estimated population of Manilatown was between 20,000 and 40,000 people. In 1968 the hotel was sold to developers intending to replace it with more profitable commercial property. After a protracted court battle, the remaining two hundred odd tenants were forcibly evicted on 4 August 1977. The hotel and other buildings to the south of it on that block were quickly torn down, after which the land lay vacant for over a quarter of a century. On 27 July 2004, a two block stretch of Kearny Street was officially declared to be Manilatown. The San Francisco Chronicle's urban design critic John King observed in 2006 that while Kearny Street's \\"architectural mish-mash\\" includes a number of skyscrapers, \\"several blocks survive ramshackle and low, delightful blurs of pre-World War II architecture that mix their styles but maintain sturdy- looking masonry facades [...] These low blocks exist because of city efforts in the 1970s and '80s to preserve older buildings and keep the Financial District from devouring everything around it. That protective foresight is what good planning is all about.\\" Landmarks Landmarks along Kearny Street include Lotta's Fountain at Market Street, where 1906 earthquake commemorations are held; One Montgomery Tower (an office building located on Kearny and Post streets, despite the name); 555 California Street, the city's fourth tallest skyscraper; the location of the old Hall of Justice at Kearny and Clay Streets now occupied by the Hilton San Francisco Financial District; the Lusty Lady, the nation's first worker-owned peep show; Portsmouth Square, the original Plaza of the pueblo of Yerba Buena; and Coit Tower, at the top of Telegraph Hill.

Biography Arthur W. Steere (known as \\"A.W.\\") was born in Glocester, Rhode Island on September 3, 1865 to Seth Hunt Steere and Lucy L. Smith. Steere was a direct descendant of Rhode Island founder, Roger Williams, William Wickenden, General William West, and Pilgrim George Soule.Title: Mayflower Families Through Five Generations- George Soule, Volume 3 Author: John E Soule, Col. and Milton E.

(Wickenden's daughter married John Steere, progenitor of that family) As a youth he worked on his family's farm in Glocester and then went to Scituate, Rhode Island where he engaged in the teaming business for three years. In 1889 Steere inherited a bequest from his relative Henry J. Steere, a prominent manufacturer, upon the latter's death. In 1887, Steere married into the Brayton family when he married Sarah Jeanette Brayton (daughter of David and Phebe Brayton) in a Congregational service; she who died in 1892. Next, Steere married Mamie Farrar (daughter of Miles and Annie (Allen) Farrar) in 1894. They had five children together: Seth, Arthur, Nelson, Nettie and Henry.\\"Arthur Wallace Steere,\\" The History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations: Biographical,(NY: The American Historical Society, 1920) 121-122. Eventually, Arthur Steere became the owner of over one thousand acres (4 km²) of property in the Rhode Island towns of Johnston, Burrillville, Foster, Scituate, Smithfield, and Glocester, making him one of the state's largest landowners. Steere sold hundreds of acres to the state of Rhode Island for the creation of the Scituate Reservoir in the 1920s. He owned various businesses on this land, including lumber yards, which produced railroad ties and telegraph poles, and also dairy farms, fruit orchards, refrigeration facilities, and a teaming business that first paved the majority of the roads in northern Rhode Island. Steere had over one hundred and fifty employees at the start of the 20th century. Senator Steere was a lifelong Republican, and in 1907 he was elected to the Rhode Island Senate representing Greenville, Rhode Island. As a senator, Steere was extremely active in property issues, serving on the property committee. Steere was also a member of the Freemasons of Greenville and Scituate and an attendant of Greenville's Free Will Baptist Church. After Steere died in January 1943, his sons Seth Hunt Steere and Henry J. Steere took over the bulk of his businesses and landholdings. Steere Orchards on Austin Avenue in Greenville is still owned by his descendants and is the largest orchard in Rhode Island. Steere was buried at Harmony Chapel Cemetery in Glocester.John Steere Family Album, (Chepachet: Steere Family Association, 1981).

They link the Orkney Mainland in the north to the island of South Ronaldsay via Burray and the two smaller islands of Lamb Holm and Glimps Holm. The barriers were built in the 1940s, primarily as naval defences to protect the anchorage at Scapa Flow, but now serve as road links. The two southern barriers, Glimps Holm to Burray and Burray to South Ronaldsay, are Category A listed. History On 14 October 1939, the Royal Navy battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk at her moorings within the natural harbour of Scapa Flow, by the German U-boat U-47 under the command of Günther Prien. U-47 had entered Scapa Flow through Holm Sound, one of several eastern entrances to Scapa Flow. The eastern passages were protected by measures including sunken block ships, booms and anti-submarine nets, but the U-47 entered at night at high tide by navigating between the block ships. To prevent further attacks, the First Lord of The Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the construction of permanent barriers. Work began in May 1940 and the barriers were completed in September 1944 but were not officially opened until 12 May 1945, four days after Victory in Europe Day. Construction The contract for building the barriers was awarded to Balfour Beatty, although part of the southernmost barrier (between Burray and South Ronaldsay) was sub- contracted to William Tawse & Co. The first Resident Superintending Civil Engineer was E K Adamson, succeeded in 1942 by G Gordon Nicol. Preparatory work on the site began in May 1940, while experiments on models for the design were undertaken at Whitworth Engineering Laboratories at the University of Manchester. The bases of the barriers were built from gabions enclosing 250,000 tonnes of broken rock, from quarries on Orkney. The gabions were dropped into place from overhead cableways into waters up to deep. The bases were then covered with 66,000 locally cast concrete blocks in five-tonne and ten-tonne sizes. The five-tonne blocks were laid on the core, and the ten- tonne blocks were arranged on the sides in a random pattern to act as wave- breaks. Labour A project of this size required a substantial labour force, which peaked in 1943 at over 2,000. Much of the labour was provided by over 1,300 Italian prisoners of war who had been captured in the desert war in North Africa; they were transported to Orkney from early 1942 onwards. The prisoners were accommodated in three camps, 600 at Camp 60 on Little Holm and the remaining 700 at two camps on Burray. Those at Camp 60 built an ornate Italian Chapel, which still survives and has become a tourist attraction.

In this model of capitalism (sometimes referred to as state development capitalism), the state has more independent, or autonomous, political power, as well as more control over the economy. A developmental state is characterized by having strong state intervention, as well as extensive regulation and planning. The term has subsequently been used to describe countries outside East Asia that satisfy the criteria of a developmental state. Botswana, for example, has warranted the label since the early 1970s.Leftwich, Adrian, \\"The Developmental State\\", Working Paper No. 6, University of York,1994 The developmental state is sometimes contrasted with a predatory state or weak state.Evans, Peter. 1995. Embedded Autonomy: States and Industrial Transformation. Princeton: Princeton University Press. The first person to seriously conceptualize the developmental state was Chalmers Johnson.Leftwich, Adrian, \\"Bringing politics back in: Towards a model of the developmental state\\", Journal of Development Studies, Volume 31, Issue 3 February 1995, pages 400-427 Johnson defined the developmental state as a state that is focused on economic development and takes necessary policy measures to accomplish that objective. He argued that Japan's economic development had much to do with far-sighted intervention by bureaucrats, particularly those in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). He wrote in his book MITI and the Japanese Miracle: > In states that were late to industrialize, the state itself led the > industrialization drive, that is, it took on developmental functions. These > two differing orientations toward private economic activities, the > regulatory orientation and the developmental orientation, produced two > different kinds of business-government relationships. The United States is a > good example of a state in which the regulatory orientation predominates, > whereas Japan is a good example of a state in which the developmental > orientation predominates. A regulatory state governs the economy mainly through regulatory agencies that are empowered to enforce a variety of standards of behavior to protect the public against market failures of various sorts, including monopolistic pricing, predation, and other abuses of market power, and by providing collective goods (such as national defense or public education) that otherwise would be undersupplied by the market. In contrast, a developmental state intervenes more directly in the economy through a variety of means to promote the growth of new industries and to reduce the dislocations caused by shifts in investment and profits from old to new industries. In other words, developmental states can pursue industrial policies, while regulatory states generally cannot. Governments in developmental states invest and mobilize the majority of capital into the most promising industrial sector that will have the maximum spillover effect for the society. Cooperation between state and major industries is crucial for maintaining stable macroeconomy. According to Alice Amsden's Getting the Price Wrong, the intervention of state in the market system such as grant of subsidy to improve competitiveness of firm, control of exchange rate, wage level and manipulation of inflation to lowered production cost for industries caused economic growth, that is mostly found in late industrializers countries but foreign to early developed countries. As in the case of Japan, there is little government ownership of industry, but the private sector is rigidly guided and restricted by bureaucratic government elites. These bureaucratic government elites are not elected officials and are thus less subject to influence by either the corporate-class or working-class through the political process. The argument from this perspective is that a government ministry can have the freedom to plan the economy and look to long- term national interests without having their economic policies disrupted by either corporate-class or working-class short-term or narrow interests. Examples in East and Southeast Asia Some of the best prospects for economic growth in the last few decades have been found in East and Southeast Asia. Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia are developing at high to moderate levels. Thailand, for example, has grown at double-digit rates most years since the early 1980s. China had been the world leader in economic growth from 2001 to 2015. It is estimated that it took England around 60 years to double its economy when the Industrial Revolution began. It took the United States around 50 years to double its economy during the American economic take-off in the late nineteenth century. Several East and Southeast Asian countries today have been doubling their economies every 10 years.Kristof, Nicholas D., and Sheryl WuDunn. 2000. Thunder From the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia. New York: Knopf. It is important to note that in most of these Asian countries, it is not just that the rich are getting richer, but the poor are becoming less poor. For example, poverty has dropped dramatically in Thailand. Research in the 1960s showed that 60 percent of the people in Thailand lived below a poverty level estimated with cost of basic necessities. By 2004, however, similar estimates showed that poverty there was around 13 to 15 percent. Thailand has been shown by some World Bank figures to have had the best record for reducing poverty per increase in GNP of any nation in the world.Nabi, Ijaz, and Jayasankur Shivakumer. 2001. Back from the Brink: Thailand's Response to the 1997 Economic Crisis. Washington, DC: World Bank.United Nations Development Report. 1999. Human Development Report of Thailand 1999. Bangkok: Author.World Bank. 2000. World Development Report 2000/2001. New York: Oxford University Press. When viewed through the lens of dependency theory, developmentalism is about countries such as Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and increasingly Vietnam, where the governments are able and willing to protect their people from the negative consequences of foreign corporate exploitation. They tend to have a strong government, also called a \\"developmental state\\" or \\"hard state\\", and have leaders who can confront multinationals and demand that they operate to protect their people's interests. These \\"development states\\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they may follow domestically mandated standards for pay and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes, and by extension leave some profits within the country. Specifically, what is meant by a developmental state is a government with sufficient organization and power to achieve its development goals.Chang, Ha-Joon. 1999. \\"The Economic Theory of the Developmental State.\\" Pp. 182-199 in Meredith Woo-Cumings (ed.), The Developmental State. Ithaca, NY: Cornall University Press.Cumings, Bruce. 1999. \\"Webs with No Spiders, Spiders with No Webs: The Genealogy of the Developmental State.\\" Pp. 61-92 in Meredith Woo-Cummings (ed.), The Developmental State. Ithaca, NY: Cornall University Press.Johnson, Chalmers. 1982. MITI and the Japanese Miracle. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press.Pempel, T.J. 1999. \\"The Developmental Regime in a Changing World Economy.\\" Pp. 137-181 in Meredith Woo-Cummings (ed.), The Developmental State. Ithaca, NY: Cornall University Press. There must be a state with the ability to prove consistent economic guidance and rational and efficient organization, and the power to back up its long-range economic policies. All of this is important because the state must be able to resist external demands from outside multinational corporations to do things for their short-term gain, overcome internal resistance from strong groups trying to protect short-term narrow interests, and control infighting within the nation pertaining to who will most benefit from development projects. =Thailand= In the late 1990s a study was conducted in which the researchers interviewed people from 24 large factories in Thailand owned by Japanese and American corporations. They found that most of the employees in these corporations made more than the average in Thailand, and substantially more than the $4.40 a day minimum wage in the country at the time. The researchers’ analysis of over 1,000 detailed questionnaires indicated that the employees rate their income and benefits significantly above average compared to Thai-owned factories. They found the working conditions in all 24 companies far from conditions reported about Nike in Southeast Asia.Richter, Frank-Jurgen. 2000. The Asian Economic Crisis. New York: Quorum Press. One answer to the discrepancies found between multinational corporations in Thailand and the conditions described for Nike workers is that companies such as Wal-Mart, The Gap, or Nike subcontract work to small local factories. These subcontractors remain more invisible, making it more easy to bribe local officials to maintain poor working conditions. When multinational corporations set up business in countries like Malaysia, Taiwan, or Thailand, their visibility makes much less likely employees will have wages and conditions below the standards of living of the country.Kerbo, Harold. 2006. World Poverty in the 21st Century. New York: McGraw-Hill. Thailand is said to fall between the U.S. model where government has little involvement in economic policy, and Japan which has governed with a very heavy hand for more than 100 years.Muscat, Robert J. 1994. The Fifth Tiger: A Study of Thai Development. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe.Kulick, Elliot, and Dick Wilson. 1996. Time for Thailand: Profile of a New Success. Bangkok: White Lotus Press. One focus of Thai development policies was on import substitution. Here, a development state must be able to tell multinational corporations that goods will be imported, if at all, with tariffs as high as 80 to 150 percent to prevent these goods from competing with goods made in (at least at first) less efficient infant factories in the poorer country. Only a development state can have the influence to enforce such a policy on rich multinational corporations (and their governments), and only a development state can have the influence to enforce such a policy against the demands of their own rich citizens who want the imported goods and want them then at a cheaper price, not waiting for infant industries to produce suitable products. Thailand began placing tariffs of 150 percent on important automobiles, but at the same time telling the foreign auto industries that if they came to Thailand to create joint ventures with a Thai company to build cars—and thus hire Thai employees, pay Thai taxes, and keep some profits within Thailand—the auto company would get many forms of government assistance. Thailand continued to protect its economy during the 1980s and 1990s despite the flood of foreign investment the nation had attracted. Thai bureaucrats started rules such as those demanding a sufficient percentage of domestic content in goods manufactured by foreign companies in Thailand and the 51 percent rule. Under the 51 percent rule, a multinational corporation starting operations in Thailand must form a joint venture with a Thai company. The result is that a Thai company with 51 percent control is better able to keep jobs and profits in the country. Countries such as Thailand have been able to keep foreign investors from leaving because the government has maintained more infrastructure investment to provide good transportation and a rather educated labor force, enhancing productivity. =Singapore= Singapore is a relatively young city-state and it obtains a title of developed country. Despite the fact that it has a lack of natural resources and an intensely competitive geographical environment, it has been growing its nation as a developmental state. In 1965, Singapore successfully became independent from Malaysian Federation, and later it changed its Fordism production oriented city state to a developmental city state in less than half a century (Kwon, 2005).Huck-ju Kwon (2005) Transforming the Developmental Welfare State in East Asia (Palgrage Macmillan) Chapter 4 and 8 It was claimed by the People's Action Party (PAP), the governing party since 1965, that adopting the developmental state strategy is in Singapore's best interests due to its unique feature of social, political, geographical, and economic conditions. At first, PAP's economic strategy was to provide cheap and disciplined labor and it provides a stable political system; Singapore has only one labor union that is directed by the PAP government. As a result, many multinational corporations (MNCs) invested in Singapore and soon Singapore came to be a solid manufacturing base (Sung, 2006).Johnny Sung (2006) Explaining the Economic Success of Singapore: The Developmental Worker as the Missing Link (Edward Elgar Publishing Inc.) Chapter 3, 5 and 8 However, the PAP soon realized that if Singapore was to move forward to industrialization then it needed to improve its national education. In the 1960s, Singapore's education was fragmented basically by race, language and habitat lines (Wilson, 1978).Wilson, Harold Edmund. Social Engineering in Singapore. Singapore: Univ. Pr., 1978. Print. Therefore, a series of education projects were launched in the hope of helping Singapore to obtain industrialization. For example, in 1970, the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) was launched to provide technical education for workers who dropped out of secondary school. (Sung, 2006) Singapore's training programs has a different function from other neoliberal cities; these programs match workers’ skills to the market of economic development. The economy is planned by the government; it arranges the market demand of labor on one hand and provides the supply of labor on the other hand. The Singapore government has noticed the country's weakness and its special geographical location. It is because that the population of Singapore was much less than other surrounding countries, so soon its manufacturing status would be replaced by other Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, China, etc. Also, other Asian countries could provide relatively cheaper and greater labor force and more raw materials of production could be exploited. Therefore, Singapore was vulnerable of facing such surrounding threats. However, the Singapore government has adopted a special view of new international division of labor; it has placed itself as a global city in the Southeast Asian region. According to Saskia Sassen's \\"global cities\\", they are cities where headquarters which are committed in participating of globalization networks and they are the result of strong integration of urbanization and globalization (Hack, Margolin and Delaye, 2010).Karl Hack and Jean-Louis Margolin (2010) Singapore from Temasek to the 21st Century: Reinventing the Global City (National University of Singapore) Chapter 1 and 4 =South Korea= South Korea has undergone rapid economic development since the end of the Korean War (1950~1953). Like other \\"late industrializers\\" (Amsden, 1989) such as Taiwan, Economy of South Korea was led by the bureaucratic governmental state that controlled and manipulated the market system.Amsden, Alice H. \\"Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization\\", Oxford University Press, June 1992, Chapter 6 Korean government implemented various economic measures in order to pursue export oriented growth. Korea at the early 60s was lacking capital and technological basis, so the only competitive advantage the country had was the low wage. Therefore, Korea first penetrated the global market with cheap labor in the light industry sector such as wigs and cotton spinning in 50s~60s. Korean industrial policy moved towards the heavy and chemical industries in the 70s and 80s, mobilizing the state's financial resources for the rapid growth of industries such as steel and shipbuilding.Korea Development Institute (2005), The Korean Economy:History of Economic Development [Powerpoint slides]. During those developmental periods, the government granted various forms of subsidies to the industries. Long-term loans and credits were given for higher competence in global market, thereby increasing export. Foreign exchange rates were often manipulated to stimulate export or import the raw materials at lower cost. Due to such subsidies on exports and manipulation by the government, the relative prices in Korean industry diverged from the free market equilibriums. Such interventions by the state are termed as \\"deliberately getting relative prices wrong\\"(Amsden, 1989), which means that the prices are intentionally deviated from the ‘right’ prices, the market equilibrium. Big business groups in chosen industries were supported and invested by the government, thereby forming intimate economic and political ties. Such groups grew to account for a large portion of GNP and became the Chaebols. South Korea's GDP per capita grew from $876 in 1950 to $22,151 in 2010. Industrial production in South Korea was 9% in 1953 but reached 38% in 2013. Korea first adopted an ISI but followed a developmental state growth strategy. Korea after their independence in 1945 lead to end of economic ties with Japan which they were heavily relied upon. During the Korean war, the country was devastated both physically and mentally. After the Korean war, South Korea focused on exporting primary products such as crops, minerals while imported manufactured goods from US. In the beginning of ISI era, Korean industries were successful in textile and light consumer good industries (Charles, 1975). South Korea eventually focused on an export oriented industries through direct government involvement. South Korean state has more autonomy over the regulation of economy, the state created conditions favorable for rapid economic growth, for example, the state provided long-term loans for industries with higher competence in global market which eventually increased the exporting sector (Chibber, 2014). Under Park Chung Hee's leadership, South Korea in 1960's created Economic Planning Board (EPB) which unified previously divided industries and created a centralized decision making state. Korea has been called one of \\"Asia's four little dragons\\" or Four Asian Tigers with its prominent economic growth (The other three being Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore).Ezra F. Vogel(1992), The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia, Foreign Affairs Korea's GDP per capita in 1980 was $1,778.5, which was only a fraction of Japan's per capita ($9,307.8). In 2014, Korea's GDP was $25,977.0, having shown dramatic growth in the past decade.World Bank, GDP per capita (current US$) Local developmental state While the developmental state is associated with East Asia, it has been argued that after 30 years of many negative experiences with the Washington Consensus, similar structures began to appear in Latin America.Milford Bateman, Juan Pablo Duran Ortíz and Kate Maclean 2011. A post- Washington consensus approach to local economic development in Latin America? An example from Medellín, Colombia . London: Overseas Development Institute The \\"Latin American\\" approach is different, however, as it often takes place at a city/municipal level, rather than at a state level and places a great emphasis on tackling social exclusion. One pioneer in this experience has been Medellin, whose experience with a local development state has been highly praised by researchers at the Overseas Development Institute. Medellin's city administration used its ownership of city's main energy provider Empresas Publicas de Medellín (EPM) and diverted 30% of EPM's profits to fund municipal spending. The spending went partly on a variety of infrastructure projects, such as the city's metro, bus network and a cable car system connecting the poorer barrio communities to the city centre. However, the city also developed a program of cash grants called 'the Medellín Solidaria' programme that are very similar to Brazil's highly successful Bolsa Familia that provide support for poor families. Additionally, the city developed the Cultura E programme that established a network of 14 publicly funded business support centres known as CEDEZO, Centros de Desarrollo Empresarial Zonal. The CEDEZOs are found in the poorest areas of Medellin and support the poor in developing business by providing free-of-charge business support services and technical advice. Also, as part of Cultura E, there is Banco de las Opportunidades that provides microloans (up to $2,500 at a cheap interest rates 0.91% monthly). This has helped create more equal opportunities for all and overcome the barriers to entry to business for poor entrepreneurs with good ideas, but lacking capital, skills and connections. It has also helped develop the local economy with new micro-enterprises. However, several mayoral candidates for the October 2011 elections have argued the Banco de las Opportunidades's interest rates are too high, loan maturity is too short and it should have grace periods. They therefore suggest a new small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development bank to complement the Banco de las Opportunidades. =Difficulties= There are difficulties with the local development state model. Despite claims at the end of the 1980s by some, such as Hernando de Soto (1989) that micro-enterprises would lead economic growth, this has not come to pass. For instance, in Medellín the informal sector has seen a huge growth in micro-enterprises, but the impact on poverty and development has been minimal. Almost none of these microenterprises have evolved into informal small or medium businesses, as the demand does not exist to absorb increased production. In other words, a successful ice-cream producer producing 30 ice- creams per day at home may sell all their product and make a livelihood out of it, but transforming it into a business, incurring the costs of mechanisation in order to produce perhaps 300, may not be worthwhile if there is no demand for so many ice-creams. Failure rates are very high and the debt incurred by owners becomes unmanageable. Recognising which micro-enterprises have a high potential is extremely difficult and the costs involved in providing business support and advise are very high. There is a great difficulty in identifying demand, especially on a global level and demand patterns are constantly changing. The limited ability of city administrations to gather enough resources to support businesses and make sound investments can be problematic. Public recognition Despite all the evidence of the importance of a development state, some international aid agencies have just recently publicly recognized the fact. The United Nations Development Program, for example, published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that “Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.”United Nations Development Report. 2000.

The Mitsui enterprise made its debut in 1673 when Mitsui Takatoshi (1622–1694), son of a sake brewer, established Echigo-ya, a dry goods department store in both Edo and Kyoto. Meeting with great success, Takatoshi extended his services to moneylending and exchange. In 1691 the Mitsuis were officially chartered as merchants of the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled during that time. Three years later the family members set up their first constitution, which included details about the amount of property due to each branch as well as the duties of the family council, a periodical assembly that controlled business and other personal matters. In the late Edo period, the Mitsuis were the richest and most eminent family in Japan, their business being thoroughly encouraged by the government of the time. After the Meiji Restoration, the family switched allegiance to the Meiji government. In 1909, a Mitsui controlled holding company took over the business, with Mitsui thus becoming a zaibatsu of more than 150 companies operating financial, industrial and commercial industries. Controversy As part of the Japanese plans for the exploitation of China, during the 1930s and 1940s the subsidiary tobacco industry of Mitsui zaibatsu had started production of special \\"Golden Bat\\" cigarettes using the then-popular in the Far East trademark. Their circulation was prohibited in Japan and was used only for export. Local Japanese secret service under the controversial Imperial Japanese Army General Kenji Doihara had the control of their distribution in China and Manchuria where the full production was exported. In the mouthpiece of each cigarette a small dose of opium was concealed, and by this subterfuge millions of unsuspecting consumers became drug addicted simultaneously creating huge profits. The mastermind of the plan, Doihara, was prosecuted and convicted for war crimes before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, sentenced to death in \\"pursued a systematic policy of weakening the native inhabitants' will to resist ... by directly and indirectly encouraging the increased production and importation of opium and other narcotics and by promoting the sale and consumption of such drugs among such people\\";The Opium Empire: Japanese Imperialism and Drug Trafficking in Asia, 1895–1945, John M. Jennings, p.102, Praeger, 1997, but no actions ever took place against the company which profited from their production. According to testimony presented at the Tokyo War Crimes trials in 1948, the revenue from the narcotization policy in China, including Manchukuo, was estimated in 20 to 30 million yen per year, while another authority stated during the trial that the annual revenue was estimated by the Japanese military at US$300 million a year, a colossal amount for the time.Mitsui: Three Centuries of Japanese Business, pages 312–313, John G.

At the end of 2004, having only played WAFL football for Subiaco, he was delisted. However the club gave Crowley a second chance and re-selected him with their 3rd pick in the rookie draft.2004 Trading Places Good form with Subiaco in 2005 led to his elevation to the senior list when both Robert Haddrill and his replacement Michael Warren were placed on the long term injury list.

He works mainly with bronze. Faroese art is art by artists living in the Faroe Islands and art by Faroese nationals living abroad. In the Faroe Islands, art is an important part of everyday life and in the public debate. It may be the special light in the Faroes which causes so many to express themselves in painting. The ever- changing Faroese weather and light provide opportunities for endless nuances, something which has fascinated both foreign and local artists over the years. However, the history of Faroese art is short, and can only be dated a couple of hundred years back. Lack of time, light and materiel may have caused the late appearance of painting. But despite this, the islands have a very active art scene. A great many of the Faroese artists of today resent being reminded that Faroese art is a comparatively recent phenomenon. They find such an observation annoying as regards their artistic work, and they claim that such a statement has no bearing whatsoever on them as artists as their frame of reference is both local and global. With the first Faroese painters the landscape became a national icon and it has remained the central topic in Faroese visual art. The grip that Faroese art, motifically speaking, takes on the Faroese landscape might seem to be a rather old-fashioned approach to visual art. The interest in installations, minimalism and conceptual art, has so far not affected Faroese art much. The village by the ocean is probably the motif which has been repeated the most. Danish art critic Ole Nørlyng concludes that nature, the wild landscape, is the driving force behind Faroese artists,http://samvit.info/index.php/arts/faroese-art but except for a close affinity with the landscape and culture of the islands, there has always been great diversity in Faroese art.  Pioneers  Díðrikur á Skarvanesi (1802–1865). This is one of the oldest preserved works in Faroese art. This painting together with four others by the same artist represent the beginning of the history of Faroese visuel art The first paintings art historians are familiar with are those by Díðrikur í Kárastovu. He was a farmer who commonly was known as Díðrikur á Skarvanesi (1802–1865). Díðrikur was settled in a small village, Skarvanes, on the island Sandoy. His subjects were real and imaginary birds in vivid colours. Although not in perfect condition, five of his paintings have been preserved. They are a feature in the permanent exhibition at the national Faroese art museum, Listasavn Føroya. One of his better paintings is entitled Moon Doves. Niels Kruse (1871–1951) was the first Faroese landscape painter, a theme which was to become a most common motif in Faroese art. Kruse lived in the village Eiði on the island Eysturoy. Kruse was almost completely self-taught. He was fortunate enough to receive some help and advice from an American explorer, Elizabeth Taylor, who stayed in the Faroes in 1895. In 1924 one of his works was accepted by a gallery in Denmark. This marked a turning point in Faroese art history, as this was the first time ever a painter had succeeded outside of the Islands. Kruse even managed to make a living from his painting, again something which earlier had been unheard of. There were some other painters from this early generation. Both Kristin í Geil and Jógvan Waagstein are worth mentioning. Both of them were well settled in Tórshavn. And again, these two were self-taught landscape painters. As was the case with Kruse, Waagstein received knowledge and advice from Elizabeth Taylor. Later on í Geil received some schooling from Kruse. These two latter, however, never made their living exclusively from painting. These painters were all pioneers in the field of visual art in the Faroes, and they helped to make their fellow countrymen aware of the art of painting. The late 19th century marks the beginning of a Faroese art tradition slowly developing for the first time. There are several reasons for this being so. The arrival of Elizabeth Taylor with her knowledge of art helped to inspired several to start painting. And most importantly the late 19th century sparked the beginning of the national movement. The national revival brought with it the love of the landscape - a brand new theme which was to become a national icon, more so than anywhere in visual art. The theme came to dominate all through the 20th century. With the first painters, the love and affection of the homeland was obvious, and still in the 21st Century the theme is being treated by a new generation of artists. However, several painters contributed to Faroese artists developing a passion for many different styles and subjects.  Mothers and fathers of Faroese art  The real history of Faroese art starts in 1927, when three young artists held an exhibition in Tórshavn. Two of these were Sámal Joensen-Mikines (1906–1979) and William Heinesen (1900–1990). The first, Mikines, came to be known as the father of Faroese art and the first Faroese artist to become internationally recognised. More importantly he was the very first Faroese artist to acquire an artistic degree. Mikines began his education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in 1928 with Aksel Jørgensen and Ejnar Nielsen as his teachers. Mikines was artistically highly inspired by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, and had a great admiration for El Greco and Delacroix. His early paintings are naturalistic, but later he became an expressive figurative painter. He was very original in his choice of colour and design. Mikines demonstrated a new approach to substance and form in painting which had a profound influence on Faroese art. He painted funerals, steep mountains and landscapes. His paintings of pilot whaling became important to future artists. He introduced the possibility of allowing the landscape to mirror the painter's inner life. William Heinesen was a very different type of artist. Literature was his vocation. Although he considered himself an amateur in visual art, he created some very important works in Faroese art. His imagery doesn't evolve around the landscape. Folktale, satire and everyday life are Heinesen's subjects. Chain Dance 1939 by Janus Kamban. Kamban was a Faroese sculptor and a representative of the \\"first generation\\" of professional artists in the Faroe Islands. Photo: Ole Wich =After World War II= During this period a new era had begun in Faroese visual art. Mikines wasn't the only one from his generation who received his formal training in Copenhagen. Faroese art experienced a virtual blossoming after World War II, when several talented and productive artists returned to the Faroe Islands after finishing their studies in Denmark. The range of motifs and styles were greatly expanded. A new generation of artists, who had acquired artistic degrees didn't want to use their art for the sole purpose of expressing their love for their country. The ones who followed included the classical modernist Janus Kamban (1913–2009), the colourist Ruth Smith (1913–1958), the graphical artist Elinborg Lützen (1915–1995) and the great abstract painter Ingálvur av Reyni (1920–2005). Together with Mikines and Heinesen, these are the mothers and fathers of Faroese art. * Kamban was the first Faroese sculptor. In style he ranges from the strictly naturalistic to the classically simple. His subjects are usually people, and he uses clay, bronze and basaltic rock for his sculptures. As a graphic artist, Kamban mostly portrays the Faroese landscape. * Smith was one of the most talented Faroese artists. Her subjects were scenery and faces. She worked very consciously with colour. Over a period of twenty years she painted numerous self-portraits, one has been held as one of the finest portraits in Scandinavian art. * Lützen's work is full of creatures from the world of myth, legend and folktale. With Lützen the graphic arts became an independent art form which enriched the artistic milieu through her all-absorbing interest in the technique of linocut, and the result of her artistic work is of high quality and intensity measured by any standard. * Av Reyni has been the most influential of them all. The dynamic lines and the temperamental pastose brushwork has become a vital part the Faroese painting tradition. Av Reyni introduced cubism, abstract expressionism and suprematism to the Faroes. His early works were rather naturalistic landscapes, but in the early 1960s he dissolved the romantic and impressionist landscape, when he started to paint more and more abstract. His paintings usually contain a figurative core, which is described by the title of his paintings. As a black-and-white artist, he has drawn many portraits as well as landscapes. He is ranked as one of the great modernists in Scandinavia.  Landscape expressionists  Light art inside deep-sea tunnel Norðoyatunnilin by Tróndur Patursson, who is well known both as a painter and as a sculptor. Above all, he is widely known for his glass paintings. The common denomination “landscape expressionist” comprises a group of diverse artists, solely because the nature and landscape are central themes in their work. Zacharias Heinesen (1936), Thomas Arge (1942–1978), Tróndur Patursson (1943), Torbjørn Olsen (1956), Barður Jákupsson (1943) and Amariel Norðoy (1945) all belong to this group, as do many others. This large generation of painters from the 1930s to 1960's has been able to find common stylistic expressions. They exploit the full spectrum of the formal possibilities painting has to offer. They work with the unified whole and detail. Sometimes the subject matter almost disappears in the pure abstraction of the colours and forms, but rarely completely. A reminiscence of the landscape always remains. Not as a true-to-life reproduction, but as a landscape experience which is communicated via a variety of temperaments. So great has their contribution to Faroese art been that for a long time a genuine Faroese painting should preferably be a highly colouristic, expressive and semi abstract landscape, filled with North-Atlantic drama. It is not an unusual criticism that Faroese art relies too heavily on nature as a motif. But when the variety of expression is taken into account, the criticism doesn't seem fair. * Zacharias Heinesen has in his paintings explored the light and colours of the landscape and tried to render the ephemeral moment. * In Thomas Arge's paintings we get a glimpse of the inner structures, shapes and colours of the landscape. * Bárður Jákupsson has found shapes and colours that others probably do not notice in Faroese Nature. * In Tróndur Patursson's work it is the sense of immensity of nature that gains significance. * The village by the ocean is probably the motif which has been repeated the most in Faroese art. In Countless paintings Amariel Norðoy has repeated the motif and shown it contains unlimited possibilities. But despite the light and distinct colours of nature and scenery, Faroese art is not exclusively landscape.  Contemporary Faroese art  The landscape has been the national theme of Faroese painting, arguably as a collectively chosen shell around the core of modern painting. In recent years, however, other subjects have emerged and appear to be edging out the landscape. The common denominator for the younger generation of Faroese artists is that they all have managed to outline new directions for Faroese art, while at the same time, relating with insight to the Faroese landscape tradition. The interest in the human mind, existential or philosophical questions or the internal landscapes seems to rise. The postmodern interest in contemporary philosophy, mass media and politics has begun to appear in Faroese art, and has emerged concomitantly with its appearance in other countries. One of the artist working in this field is Ole Wich (1953), who has worked with cross media art on the internet connected to present political and culturel issues in the faroese society, as well as conceptuel pieces places between visual expression and science. The Faroese visual art has hardly ever been as manifold as it is today, although the genre remains traditional painting. There is a lot of pessimism among the artists themselves. They are doubtful of the future of Faroese art and they fear that the small-scaled nature and isolation of Faroese art may prove to be insurmountable handicaps. In the long run, they say 50,000 people and a couple of dozen artists will not be able to sustain a living artistic culture. Naturally, there is a danger that it might stagnate and die from lack of nourishment. At the same time, it is difficult to see how things could go so wrong while the need is so great.http://www.thearctic.is/articles/cases/art%20in%20the%20north/enska/kafli_003.htm There are many young artists who are currently identifying new paths for Faroese art. The younger generation of Faroese artists has mainly chosen to reside abroad as has Hansina Iversen, who is based in Copenhagen and Hanni Bjartalíð in Helsinki. * Hansina Iversen (1966) ostensibly distances herself from nature as a motif. Her pictures are non-figurative and pure, seemingly purified of motif. The smooth fluency of her works are an exploration of the absolute and, thus, nature. Iversen has created a new philosophical approach to the Faroese Landscape tradition. * Hanni Bjartalíð (1968) uses humour to describe man's relation to nature. His imagery is primarily of the modern world. Modern man's alienation from nature is a natural theme in his art. Bjartalíð demonstrates great freedom regarding Faroese and Nordic art landscape traditions, which are associated with romantic conception of a unique Nordic soul characterised by a close relation to nature. * Edward Fuglø (1965) avoids landscapes; his symbolism concerns people. He creates surreal- comic and ironic paintings. Fuglø observes and mocks people – mostly men – in their absurd activities. The images are always pointed at political or perhaps art-political commentary. His imagery is in many ways innovative in the Faroese tradition. Fuglø is also one of the best illustrators in the Faroes.  Art galleries  In the Faroe Islands there is a great interest in buying Faroese art to decorate your home with. This appreciation means that it is easy to find art galleries round about the islands. Some galleries are dedicated to local artists, while others have regular exhibitions. But the number of art galleries is highest in Tórshavn. The largest collection af Faroese art is on display at Listasavn Føroya, the art museum in Tórshavn * In Tórshavn you will find the national art museum Listasavn Føroya. The Art Museum was founded in 1989. The present gallery was opened in 1993. The exhibition building is faced with black tarred wood, and has elements of traditional Faroese building. It is surrounded by trees, as it is situated next to a park. The permanent collection displays some of the best works by William Heinesen, Ingálvur av Reyni and Sámal Mikines. Each year two exhibitions take place that focus exclusively on Faroese artists. The first one is the spring exhibition in May; the second is the annual Saint Olav's Day exhibition in late July. Whereas the first one exclusively features professional artists, the latter one mainly features amateurs. * Listahøllin is situated in a green concrete building at Tórshavn Shipyard. * In Vágur located in the island Suðuroy the southernmost island, there is a Ruth Smith Art Museum. The art museum has artworks (paintings and drawings) made by Ruth Smith. * In Sandur, the main village on Sandoy, there is an art museum \\"Listasavnið á Sandi\\" with artworks (paintings, sculptures etc.) by various Faroese artists. The art collection and the museum building was donated to the village in 2005 by a Sofus Olsen, who grew up in Sandur, but lived in Tórshavn for many years. The museum opened on his 92nd birthday.  Art on stamps  Several paintings by Faroese artists have been featured on stamps. All Faroese stamp editions are about items relating to the Faroes and most of them are designed by Faroese artists. Faroese art is among the main motifs, both in reproductions of important paintings and in involving the artists in drawing stamps.

In contrast to the United Kingdom, Guernsey Post pillar boxes can be identified by their distinctive blue colour. History A Guernsey Post pillar box The first pillar boxes in Britain were introduced in the Channel Islands as an experiment in 1852. Anthony Trollope, the novelist, who was employed by the General Post Office, trialled pillar boxes in the Channel Islands before introducing them into mainland Britain.British Postal Museum & Archive. \\"Channel Island Box, 1853, accession number: OB1996.653\\" He was influenced by roadside letter-receiving pillars used in France. Before the use of pillar boxes, on the mainland, individual letters would be taken by hand to a letter receiving house or post office, which was often a coaching inn, a postage stamp purchased and the letter handed to the receiver or postmaster, to connect with the mail coach and later the railway.GREATER LONDON INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY SOCIETY. \\"Spot It And Jot It: Letter Boxes\\" \\" In the Channel Islands, people took their letters to the mail steamer when it was awaiting the tide in the harbour – the particular problem of an island mail service then. Pillar boxes allowed letters to be posted at any time and they could then be collected when a steamer was due. They were convenient and immediately successful. However, as with many innovations, the first boxes were introduced into Jersey.Oldfield, Molly, Harkin, James and Mitchinson, John. \\"Quite interesting: A quietly intriguing column.

Guernsey stamps were first issued in the island during the German Occupation of 1940–1945, when there was a great shortage of British stamps, as all ties with mainland Britain had been severed by the German authorities. One of Guernsey Post's Fiat Scudo postal vans, in Saint Peter Port Guernsey's government, the States of Guernsey, took over the running of postal services from the British Government in October 1969 (as did Jersey, forming Jersey Post).

Another problem lies within the mathematical framework of the Standard Model itself: the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of general relativity, to the point where one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known spacetime singularities like the Big Bang and black hole event horizons). Theories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the standard model through supersymmetry, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), and entirely novel explanations, such as string theory, M-theory, and extra dimensions. As these theories tend to reproduce the entirety of current phenomena, the question of which theory is the right one, or at least the \\"best step\\" towards a Theory of Everything, can only be settled via experiments, and is one of the most active areas of research in both theoretical and experimental physics. Problems with the Standard Model Despite being the most successful theory of particle physics to date, the Standard Model is not perfect. A large share of the published output of theoretical physicists consists of proposals for various forms of \\"Beyond the Standard Model\\" new physics proposals that would modify the Standard Model in ways subtle enough to be consistent with existing data, yet address its imperfections materially enough to predict non-Standard Model outcomes of new experiments that can be proposed. The Standard Model of elementary particles + hypothetical Graviton =Phenomena not explained= The Standard Model is inherently an incomplete theory. There are fundamental physical phenomena in nature that the Standard Model does not adequately explain: * Gravity. The standard model does not explain gravity. The approach of simply adding a graviton to the Standard Model does not recreate what is observed experimentally without other modifications, as yet undiscovered, to the Standard Model. Moreover, the Standard Model is widely considered to be incompatible with the most successful theory of gravity to date, general relativity. But see also * Dark matter. Cosmological observations tell us the standard model explains about 5% of the energy present in the universe. About 26% should be dark matter, which would behave just like other matter, but which only interacts weakly (if at all) with the Standard Model fields. Yet, the Standard Model does not supply any fundamental particles that are good dark matter candidates. * Dark energy. The remaining 69% of universe's energy should consist of the so-called dark energy, a constant energy density for the vacuum. Attempts to explain dark energy in terms of vacuum energy of the standard model lead to a mismatch of 120 orders of magnitude.Krauss, L. (2009). A Universe from Nothing. AAI Conference. * Neutrino masses. According to the standard model, neutrinos are massless particles. However, neutrino oscillation experiments have shown that neutrinos do have mass. Mass terms for the neutrinos can be added to the standard model by hand, but these lead to new theoretical problems. For example, the mass terms need to be extraordinarily small and it is not clear if the neutrino masses would arise in the same way that the masses of other fundamental particles do in the Standard Model. * Matter–antimatter asymmetry. The universe is made out of mostly matter. However, the standard model predicts that matter and antimatter should have been created in (almost) equal amounts if the initial conditions of the universe did not involve disproportionate matter relative to antimatter. Yet, there is no mechanism in the Standard Model to sufficiently explain this asymmetry.  Experimental results not explained  No experimental result is accepted as definitively contradicting the Standard Model at the five-sigma level, widely considered to be the threshold of a discovery in particle physics. Because every experiment contains some degree of statistical and systemic uncertainty, and the theoretical predictions themselves are also almost never calculated exactly and are subject to uncertainties in measurements of the fundamental constants of the Standard Model (some of which are tiny and others of which are substantial), it is to be expected that some of the hundreds of experimental tests of the Standard Model will deviate from it to some extent, even if there were no new physics to be discovered. At any given moment there are several experimental results standing that significantly differ from a Standard Model-based prediction. In the past, many of these discrepancies have been found to be statistical flukes or experimental errors that vanish as more data has been collected, or when the same experiments were conducted more carefully. On the other hand, any physics beyond the Standard Model would necessarily first appear in experiments as a statistically significant difference between an experiment and the theoretical prediction. The task is to determine which is the case. In each case, physicists seek to determine if a result is merely a statistical fluke or experimental error on the one hand, or a sign of new physics on the other. More statistically significant results cannot be mere statistical flukes but can still result from experimental error or inaccurate estimates of experimental precision. Frequently, experiments are tailored to be more sensitive to experimental results that would distinguish the Standard Model from theoretical alternatives. Some of the most notable examples include the following: * Anomalous magnetic dipole moment of muon – the experimentally measured value of muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment (muon \\"g − 2\\") is significantly different from the Standard Model prediction. * B meson decay etc. – results from a BaBar experiment may suggest a surplus over Standard Model predictions of a type of particle decay (). In this, an electron and positron collide, resulting in a B meson and an antimatter meson, which then decays into a D meson and a tau lepton as well as a tau antineutrino. While the level of certainty of the excess (3.4 σ in statistical language) is not enough to declare a break from the Standard Model, the results are a potential sign of something amiss and are likely to affect existing theories, including those attempting to deduce the properties of Higgs bosons. In 2015, LHCb reported observing a 2.1 sigma excess in the same ratio of branching fractions. The Belle experiment also reported an excess. In 2017 an analysis of all available data reported a 5 sigma deviation from SM. =Theoretical predictions not observed= Observation at particle colliders of all of the fundamental particles predicted by the Standard Model has been confirmed. The Higgs boson is predicted by the Standard Model's explanation of the Higgs mechanism, which describes how the weak SU(2) gauge symmetry is broken and how fundamental particles obtain mass; it was the last particle predicted by the Standard Model to be observed. On July 4, 2012, CERN scientists using the Large Hadron Collider announced the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson, with a mass of about . A Higgs boson was confirmed to exist on March 14, 2013, although efforts to confirm that it has all of the properties predicted by the Standard Model are ongoing. A few hadrons (i.e. composite particles made of quarks) whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model, which can be produced only at very high energies in very low frequencies have not yet been definitively observed, and \\"glueballs\\" (i.e. composite particles made of gluons) have also not yet been definitively observed. Some very low frequency particle decays predicted by the Standard Model have also not yet been definitively observed because insufficient data is available to make a statistically significant observation. =Theoretical problems= Some features of the standard model are added in an ad hoc way. These are not problems per se (i.e. the theory works fine with these ad hoc features), but they imply a lack of understanding. These ad hoc features have motivated theorists to look for more fundamental theories with fewer parameters. Some of the ad hoc features are: * Hierarchy problem – the standard model introduces particle masses through a process known as spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the Higgs field. Within the standard model, the mass of the Higgs gets some very large quantum corrections due to the presence of virtual particles (mostly virtual top quarks). These corrections are much larger than the actual mass of the Higgs. This means that the bare mass parameter of the Higgs in the standard model must be fine tuned in such a way that almost completely cancels the quantum corrections. This level of fine-tuning is deemed unnatural by many theorists. * Number of parameters – the standard model depends on 19 numerical parameters. Their values are known from experiment, but the origin of the values is unknown. Some theorists have tried to find relations between different parameters, for example, between the masses of particles in different generations or calculating particle masses, such as in asymptotic safety scenarios. * Quantum triviality – suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar Higgs particles. This is sometimes called the Landau pole problem. * Strong CP problem – theoretically it can be argued that the standard model should contain a term that breaks CP symmetry—relating matter to antimatter—in the strong interaction sector. Experimentally, however, no such violation has been found, implying that the coefficient of this term is very close to zero. This fine tuning is also considered unnatural. Grand unified theories The standard model has three gauge symmetries; the colour SU(3), the weak isospin SU(2), and the weak hypercharge U(1) symmetry, corresponding to the three fundamental forces. Due to renormalization the coupling constants of each of these symmetries vary with the energy at which they are measured. Around these couplings become approximately equal. This has led to speculation that above this energy the three gauge symmetries of the standard model are unified in one single gauge symmetry with a simple gauge group, and just one coupling constant. Below this energy the symmetry is spontaneously broken to the standard model symmetries. Popular choices for the unifying group are the special unitary group in five dimensions SU(5) and the special orthogonal group in ten dimensions SO(10). Theories that unify the standard model symmetries in this way are called Grand Unified Theories (or GUTs), and the energy scale at which the unified symmetry is broken is called the GUT scale. Generically, grand unified theories predict the creation of magnetic monopoles in the early universe, and instability of the proton. Neither of these have been observed, and this absence of observation puts limits on the possible GUTs. Supersymmetry Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the Lagrangian. These symmetries exchange fermionic particles with bosonic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of supersymmetric particles, abbreviated as sparticles, which include the sleptons, squarks, neutralinos and charginos. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose spin differs by 1/2 from the ordinary particle. Due to the breaking of supersymmetry, the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing particle colliders may not be powerful enough to produce them. Neutrinos In the standard model, neutrinos have exactly zero mass. This is a consequence of the standard model containing only left-handed neutrinos. With no suitable right-handed partner, it is impossible to add a renormalizable mass term to the standard model. Measurements however indicated that neutrinos spontaneously change flavour, which implies that neutrinos have a mass. These measurements only give the mass differences between the different flavours. The best constraint on the absolute mass of the neutrinos comes from precision measurements of tritium decay, providing an upper limit 2 eV, which makes them at least five orders of magnitude lighter than the other particles in the standard model. This necessitates an extension of the standard model, which not only needs to explain how neutrinos get their mass, but also why the mass is so small. One approach to add masses to the neutrinos, the so-called seesaw mechanism, is to add right-handed neutrinos and have these couple to left-handed neutrinos with a Dirac mass term. The right-handed neutrinos have to be sterile, meaning that they do not participate in any of the standard model interactions. Because they have no charges, the right-handed neutrinos can act as their own anti- particles, and have a Majorana mass term. Like the other Dirac masses in the standard model, the neutrino Dirac mass is expected to be generated through the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore unpredictable. The standard model fermion masses differ by many orders of magnitude; the Dirac neutrino mass has at least the same uncertainty. On the other hand, the Majorana mass for the right-handed neutrinos does not arise from the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore expected to be tied to some energy scale of new physics beyond the standard model, for example the Planck scale. Therefore, any process involving right-handed neutrinos will be suppressed at low energies. The correction due to these suppressed processes effectively gives the left-handed neutrinos a mass that is inversely proportional to the right-handed Majorana mass, a mechanism known as the see-saw. The presence of heavy right-handed neutrinos thereby explains both the small mass of the left-handed neutrinos and the absence of the right-handed neutrinos in observations. However, due to the uncertainty in the Dirac neutrino masses, the right-handed neutrino masses can lie anywhere. For example, they could be as light as keV and be dark matter, they can have a mass in the LHC energy range and lead to observable lepton number violation, or they can be near the GUT scale, linking the right-handed neutrinos to the possibility of a grand unified theory. The mass terms mix neutrinos of different generations. This mixing is parameterized by the PMNS matrix, which is the neutrino analogue of the CKM quark mixing matrix. Unlike the quark mixing, which is almost minimal, the mixing of the neutrinos appears to be almost maximal. This has led to various speculations of symmetries between the various generations that could explain the mixing patterns. The mixing matrix could also contain several complex phases that break CP invariance, although there has been no experimental probe of these. These phases could potentially create a surplus of leptons over anti-leptons in the early universe, a process known as leptogenesis. This asymmetry could then at a later stage be converted in an excess of baryons over anti-baryons, and explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The light neutrinos are disfavored as an explanation for the observation of dark matter, due to considerations of large-scale structure formation in the early universe. Simulations of structure formation show that they are too hot—i.e. their kinetic energy is large compared to their mass—while formation of structures similar to the galaxies in our universe requires cold dark matter. The simulations show that neutrinos can at best explain a few percent of the missing dark matter. However, the heavy sterile right-handed neutrinos are a possible candidate for a dark matter WIMP. Preon models Several preon models have been proposed to address the unsolved problem concerning the fact that there are three generations of quarks and leptons. Preon models generally postulate some additional new particles which are further postulated to be able to combine to form the quarks and leptons of the standard model. One of the earliest preon models was the Rishon model. To date, no preon model is widely accepted or fully verified. Theories of everything Theoretical physics continues to strive toward a theory of everything, a theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of any experiment that could be carried out in principle. In practical terms the immediate goal in this regard is to develop a theory which would unify the Standard Model with General Relativity in a theory of quantum gravity. Additional features, such as overcoming conceptual flaws in either theory or accurate prediction of particle masses, would be desired. The challenges in putting together such a theory are not just conceptual - they include the experimental aspects of the very high energies needed to probe exotic realms. Several notable attempts in this direction are supersymmetry, loop quantum gravity, and string theory. =Supersymmetry= =Loop quantum gravity= Theories of quantum gravity such as loop quantum gravity and others are thought by some to be promising candidates to the mathematical unification of quantum field theory and general relativity, requiring less drastic changes to existing theories. However recent work places stringent limits on the putative effects of quantum gravity on the speed of light, and disfavours some current models of quantum gravity. =String theory= Extensions, revisions, replacements, and reorganizations of the Standard Model exist in attempt to correct for these and other issues. String theory is one such reinvention, and many theoretical physicists think that such theories are the next theoretical step toward a true Theory of Everything. Among the numerous variants of string theory, M-theory, whose mathematical existence was first proposed at a String Conference in 1995 by Edward Witten, is believed by many to be a proper \\"ToE\\" candidate, notably by physicists Brian Greene and Stephen Hawking. Though a full mathematical description is not yet known, solutions to the theory exist for specific cases. Recent works have also proposed alternate string models, some of which lack the various harder-to-test features of M-theory (e.g. the existence of Calabi–Yau manifolds, many extra dimensions, etc.) including works by well-published physicists such as Lisa Randall.

It is located between Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge. Buildings The square features buildings belonging to various architectural styles, including the Gothic Church of Our Lady before Týn, which has been the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century. Its characteristic towers are 80 m high. The Baroque St. Nicholas Church is another church located in the square. Prague Orloj is a medieval astronomical clock mounted on the Old Town Hall. The clock was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still in operation. The tower of the Old Town Hall is open to the public and offers panoramic views of the Old Town. An art museum of the Czech National Gallery is located in the Kinský Palace. Statues and memorials The square's center is home to a statue of religious reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in Konstanz for his beliefs. This led to the Hussite Wars. The statue known as the Jan Hus Memorial was erected on 6 July 1915 to mark the 500th anniversary of his death. In front of the Old Town Hall, there is also a memorial to the \\"martyrs\\" (including Jan Jesenius and Maxmilián Hošťálek) beheaded on that spot during the Old Town Square execution by Habsburgs, after the Battle of White Mountain.

The languages of India are divided into various language families, of which the Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian languages are the most widely spoken. There are also many languages belonging to unrelated language families such as Austroasiatic and Sino- Tibetan, spoken by smaller groups. Linguistic records begin with the appearance of the Brāhmī script from about the 18rd century BCE. Indo-Aryan languages =Proto-Indo-Aryan= Proto-Indo-Aryan is a proto-language hypothesized to have been the direct ancestor of all Indo-Aryan languages. It would have had similarities to Proto-Indo-Iranian, but would ultimately have used Sanskritized phonemes and morphemes. =Old Indo-Aryan= Vedic Sanskrit Devimahatmya manuscript on palm-leaf, in an early Bhujimol script, Bihar, India or Nepal, 11th century Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, a large collection of hymns, incantations, and religio- philosophical discussions which form the earliest religious texts in India and the basis for much of the Hindu religion. Modern linguists consider the metrical hymns of the Rigveda to be the earliest. The hymns preserved in the Rigveda were preserved by oral tradition alone over several centuries before the introduction of writing, the oldest aryan language among them predating the introduction of Brahmi by as much as a millennium. The end of the Vedic period is marked by the composition of the Upanishads, which form the concluding part of the Vedic corpus in the traditional compilations, dated to roughly 500 BCE. It is around this time that Sanskrit began the transition from a first language to a second language of religion and learning, marking the beginning of Classical India. Classical Sanskrit The oldest aryan language surviving Sanskrit grammar is Pāṇini's Aṣtādhyāyī (\\"Eight-Chapter Grammar\\") dating to c. the 5th century BCE. It is essentially a prescriptive grammar, i.e., an authority that defines (rather than describes) correct Sanskrit, although it contains descriptive parts, mostly to account for Vedic forms that had already passed out of use in Pāṇini's time. Knowledge of Sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment. Vedic Sanskrit and Classical or \\"Paninian\\" Sanskrit, while broadly similar, are separate varieties, which differ in a number of points of phonology, vocabulary, and grammar. =Middle Indo-Aryan= Prakrits Prakrit (Sanskrit prākṛta प्राकृत, the past participle of प्राकृ, meaning \\"original, natural, artless, normal, ordinary, usual\\", i.e. \\"vernacular\\", in contrast to samskrta \\"excellently made\\", both adjectives elliptically referring to vak \\"speech\\") is the broad family of Indic languages and dialects spoken in ancient India. Some modern scholars include all Middle Indo-Aryan languages under the rubric of \\"Prakrits\\", while others emphasise the independent development of these languages, often separated from the history of Sanskrit by wide divisions of caste, religion, and geography. The Prakrits became literary languages, generally patronized by kings identified with the kshatriya caste. The earliest inscriptions in Prakrit are those of Ashoka, emperor of the Maurya Empire, and while the various Prakrit languages are associated with different patron dynasties, with different religions and different literary traditions. In Sanskrit drama, kings speak in Prakrit when addressing women or servants, in contrast to the Sanskrit used in reciting more formal poetic monologues. The three Dramatic Prakrits – Sauraseni, Magadhi, Maharashtri, as well as Jain Prakrit each represent a distinct tradition of literature within the history of India. Other Prakrits are reported in historical sources, but have no extant corpus (e.g., Paisaci). =Pali= Pali is the Middle Indo-Aryan language in which the Theravada Buddhist scriptures and commentaries are preserved. Pali is believed by the Theravada tradition to be the same language as Magadhi, but modern scholars believe this to be unlikely. Pali shows signs of development from several underlying Prakrits as well as some Sanskritisation. The Prakrit of the North- western area of India known as Gāndhāra has come to be called Gāndhārī. A few documents are written in the Kharoṣṭhi script survive including a version of the Dhammapada. Apabhraṃśa/Apasabda The Prakrits (which includes Pali) were gradually transformed into Apabhraṃśas (अपभ्रंश) which were used until about the 13th century CE. The term apabhraṃśa, meaning \\"fallen away\\", refers to the dialects of Northern India before the rise of modern Northern Indian languages, and implies a corrupt or non-standard language. A significant amount of apabhraṃśa literature has been found in Jain libraries. While Amir Khusro and Kabir were writing in a language quite similar to modern Hindi- Urdu, many poets, especially in regions that were still ruled by Hindu kings, continued to write in Apabhraṃśa. Apabhraṃśa authors include Sarahapad of Kamarupa, Devasena of Dhar (9th century CE), Pushpadanta of Manikhet (9th century CE), Dhanapal, Muni Ramsimha, Hemachandra of Patan, Raighu of Gwalior (15th century CE). An early example of the use of Apabhraṃśa is in Vikramūrvashīiya of Kalidasa, when Pururava asks the animals in the forest about his beloved who had disappeared. =Modern Indo-Aryan= Hindustani Hindustani is right now the most spoken language in the Indian subcontinent and the fourth most spoken language in the world. The development of Hindustani revolves around the various Hindi dialects originating mainly from Sauraseni Apabhramsha. A Jain text Shravakachar written in 933AD is considered the first Hindi book. Modern Hindi is based on the prestigious Khariboli dialect which started to take Persian and Arabic words too with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate; however, the Arabic- Persian influence was profound mainly on Urdu and to a lesser extent on Hindi.Khadiboli also started to spread across North India as a vernacular form previously commonly known as Hindustani. Amir Khusrow wrote poems in Khariboli and Brajbhasha and referred that language as Hindavi. During the Bhakti era, many poems were composed in Khariboli, Brajbhasa, and Awadhi. One such classic is Ramcharitmanas, written by Tulsidas in Awadhi. In 1623 Jatmal wrote a book in Khariboli with the name 'Gora Badal ki Katha'. The establishment of British rule in the subcontinent saw the clear division of Hindi and Urdu registers. This period also saw the rise of modern Hindi literature starting with Bharatendu Harishchandra. This period also shows further Sanskritization of the Hindi language in literature. Hindi is right now the official language in nine states of India— Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh—and the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Post-independence Hindi became the official language of the Central Government of India along with English. Urdu has been the national and official language of Pakistan as well as the lingua franca of the country. Outside the India, Hindustani is widely understood in other parts of the Indian subcontinent and also used as a lingua franca, and is the main language of Bollywood. Dravidian languages The Dravidian family of languages includes approximately 73 languages that are mainly spoken in southern India and northeastern Sri Lanka, as well as certain areas in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and eastern and central India, as well as in parts of southern Afghanistan, and overseas in other countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Malaysia and Singapore. The origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation, are unclear, and the situation is not helped by the lack of comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages. Many linguists, however, tend to favor the theory that speakers of Dravidian languages spread southwards and eastwards through the Indian subcontinent, based on the fact that the southern Dravidian languages show some signs of contact with linguistic groups which the northern Dravidian languages do not. Proto-Dravidian is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian and Proto-South Dravidian around 1500 BCE, although some linguists have argued that the degree of differentiation between the sub- families points to an earlier split. It was not until 1856 that Robert Caldwell published his Comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages, which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established it as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term \\"Dravidian\\" from the Sanskrit drāvida, related to the word 'Tamil' or 'Tamilan', which is seen in such forms as into 'Dramila', 'Drami˜a', 'Dramida' and 'Dravida' which was used in a 7th-century text to refer to the languages of the southern India. The Dravidian Etymological Dictionary was published by T. Burrow and M. B. Emeneau. =History of Tamil= Tamil inscription of Mangulam Tamil is the oldest language in India and in the World. As a Dravidian language, Tamil descends from Proto- Dravidian. Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the 6th millennium BCE. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India. The next phase in the reconstructed proto-history of Tamil is Proto-South Dravidian. The linguistic evidence suggests that Proto- South Dravidian was spoken around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE and that proto-Tamil emerged around the 3rd century BCE. The earliest epigraphic attestations of Tamil are generally taken to have been written shortly thereafter. Among Indian languages, Tamil has one of the ancient Indian literature besides others.Sivathamby, K (December 1974) Early South Indian Society and Economy: The Tinai Concept, Social Scientist, Vol.3 No.5 December 1974 Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods, Old Tamil (400 BCE – 700 CE), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present). Old Tamil The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions from around the 6th century BCE in caves and on pottery. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the Tolkāppiyam, an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the 2nd century BCE. A large number of literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as Sangam literature. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st and 5th centuries CE,. The dating of Sangam literature and the identification of its language with Old Tamil have recently been questioned by Herman Tieken who argues that the works are better understood as 9th-century Pāṇṭiyan dynasty compositions, deliberately written in an archaising style to make them seem older than they were (). Tieken's dating has, however, been criticised by reviewers of his work. See e.g. , , and which makes them the oldest extant body of secular literature in India. Other literary works in Old Tamil include two long epics, Cilappatikāram and Maṇimēkalai, and a number of ethical and didactic texts, written between the 5th and 8th centuries. Old Tamil preserved some features of Proto-Dravidian, including the inventory of consonants, the syllable structure, and various grammatical features. Amongst these was the absence of a distinct present tense – like Proto-Dravidian, Old Tamil only had two tenses, the past and the \\"non-past\\". Old Tamil verbs also had a distinct negative conjugation (e.g. ' (காணேன்) \\"I do not see\\", ' (காணோம்) \\"we do not see\\"). Nouns could take pronominal suffixes like verbs to express ideas: e.g. ' (பெண்டிரேம்) \\"we are women\\" formed from ' (பெண்டிர்) \\"women\\" + - (ஏம்) and the first person plural marker. Despite the significant amount of grammatical and syntactical change between Old, Middle and Modern Tamil, Tamil demonstrates grammatical continuity across these stages: many characteristics of the later stages of the language have their roots in features of Old Tamil. Middle Tamil The evolution of Old Tamil into Middle Tamil, which is generally taken to have been completed by the 8th century, was characterised by a number of phonological and grammatical changes. In phonological terms, the most important shifts were the virtual disappearance of the aytam (ஃ), an old phoneme, the coalescence of the alveolar and dental nasals, and the transformation of the alveolar plosive into a rhotic. In grammar, the most important change was the emergence of the present tense. The present tense evolved out of the verb ' (கில்), meaning \\"to be possible\\" or \\"to befall\\". In Old Tamil, this verb was used as an aspect marker to indicate that an action was micro-durative, non-sustained or non-lasting, usually in combination with a time marker such as ' (ன்). In Middle Tamil, this usage evolved into a present tense marker – ' (கின்ற) – which combined the old aspect and time markers. Middle Tamil also saw a significant increase in the Sanskritisation of Tamil. From the period of the Pallava dynasty onwards, a number of Sanskrit loan-words entered Tamil, particularly in relation to political, religious and philosophical concepts. Sanskrit also influenced Tamil grammar, in the increased use of cases and in declined nouns becoming adjuncts of verbs, and phonology. The Tamil script also changed in the period of Middle Tamil. Tamil Brahmi and Vaṭṭeḻuttu, into which it evolved, were the main scripts used in Old Tamil inscriptions. From the 8th century onwards, however, the Pallavas began using a new script, derived from the Pallava Grantha script which was used to write Sanskrit, which eventually replaced Vaṭṭeḻuttu. Middle Tamil is attested in a large number of inscriptions, and in a significant body of secular and religious literature. These include the religious poems and songs of the Bhakthi poets, such as the Tēvāram verses on Saivism and Nālāyira Tivya Pirapantam on Vaishnavism, and adaptations of religious legends such as the 12th-century Tamil Ramayana composed by Kamban and the story of 63 shaivite devotees known as Periyapurāṇam. Iraiyaṉār Akapporuḷ, an early treatise on love poetics, and Naṉṉūl, a 12th-century grammar that became the standard grammar of literary Tamil, are also from the Middle Tamil period. Modern Tamil Christian prayers in Tamil The Nannul remains the standard normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil. Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil – negation is, instead, expressed either morphologically or syntactically. Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions, and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic. Contact with European languages also affected both written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the syntactic argument structure of English. Simultaneously, a strong strain of linguistic purism emerged in the early 20th century, culminating in the Pure Tamil Movement which called for removal of all Sanskritic and other foreign elements from Tamil. It received some support from Dravidian parties and nationalists who supported Tamil independence.: \\"Dravidianism, too, lent its support to the contestatory classicist project, motivated principally by the political imperative of countering (Sanskritic) Indian nationalism... It was not until the DMK came to power in 1967 that such demands were fulfilled, and the pure Tamil cause received a boost, although purification efforts are not particularly high on the agenda of either the Dravidian movement or the Dravidianist idiom of tamiḻppaṟṟu.\\" This led to the replacement of a significant number of Sanskrit loanwords by Tamil equivalents, though many others remain. Literature Tamil literature has a rich and long literary tradition spanning more than two thousand years. The oldest extant works show signs of maturity indicating an even longer period of evolution. Contributors to the Tamil literature are mainly from Tamil people from Tamil Nadu, Sri Lankan Tamils from Sri Lanka, and from Tamil diaspora. Also, there have been notable contributions from European authors. The history of Tamil literature follows the history of Tamil Nadu, closely following the social and political trends of various periods. The secular nature of the early Sangam poetry gave way to works of religious and didactic nature during the Middle Ages. Jain and Buddhist authors during the medieval period and Muslim and European authors later, contributed to the growth of Tamil literature. A revival of Tamil literature took place from the late 19th century when works of religious and philosophical nature were written in a style that made it easier for the common people to enjoy. Nationalist poets began to utilize the power of poetry in influencing the masses. With the growth of literacy, Tamil prose began to blossom and mature. Short stories and novels began to appear. The popularity of Tamil Cinema has also provided opportunities for modern Tamil poets to emerge. =History of Kannada= Halmidi Inscription replica Kannada is one of oldest languages in South India,'Purva HaleGannada or Pre-old Kannada was the language of Banavasi in the early Christian era, the Satavahana and Kadamba eras (Wilks in Rice, B.L. (1897), p490)Mahadevan, Iravatham (2003). Early Tamil Epigraphy from the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. Cambridge, Harvard University Press. The spoken language is said to have separated from its proto-language source earlier than Tamil and about the same time as Tulu.A family tree of Dravidian languages . Sourced from Encyclopaedia Britannica. However, archaeological evidence would indicate a written tradition for this language of around 1600–1650 years. The initial development of the Kannada language is similar to that of other south Indian languages.Kittel (1993), p1-2\\"Literature in Kannada owes a great deal to Sanskrit, the magic wand whose touch raised Kannada from a level of patois to that of a literary idiom\\". (Sastri 1955, p309) Stages of development By the time Halmidi shasana (stone inscription) Kannada had become an official language. It is said that the halegannada later developed and deviated into 2 currently coexisting languages Kannada and Telugu. Some of the linguistics suggest that Tamil & HaLegannada are very similar or might have same roots. Ex: For milk in both languages it is 'Paalu', the postfix to the names of elders to show respect is 'avar / avargaL'. =600 – 1200 AD= During this era, language underwent a lot of changes as seen from the literary works of great poets of the era viz Pampa, Ranna, Ponna. =1400 – 1600 AD= Vijayanagar Empire which is called the Golden era in the history of medieval India saw a lot of development in all literary form of both Kannada and Telugu. During the ruling of the King Krishnadevaraya many wonderful works. Poet Kumaravyasa wrote Mahabharata in Kannada in a unique style called \\"shatpadi\\" (six lines is a stanza of the poem). This era also saw the origin of Dasa Sahitya, the Carnatic music. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa wrote several songs praising Lord Krishna. This gave a new dimension to Kannada literature. Stone inscriptions The first written record in the Kannada language is traced to Emperor Ashoka's Brahmagiri edict dated 200 BCE.The word Isila found in the Ashokan inscription (called the Brahmagiri edict from Karnataka) meaning to shoot an arrow is a Kannada word, indicating that Kannada was a spoken language (Dr. D.L. Narasimhachar in Kamath 2001, p5) The first example of a full-length Kannada language stone inscription (shilashaasana) containing Brahmi characters with characteristics attributed to those of protokannada in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada) script can be found in the Halmidi inscription, dated c. 450, indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language by this time.Ramesh (1984), p10A report on Halmidi inscription, Kamath (2001), p10 Over 30,000 inscriptions written in the Kannada language have been discovered so far. The Chikkamagaluru inscription of 500 CE is another example.Narasimhacharya (1988), p6Rice (1921), p13 Prior to the Halmidi inscription, there is an abundance of inscriptions containing Kannada words, phrases and sentences, proving its antiquity. Badami cliff shilashaasana of Pulakeshin I is an example of a Sanskrit inscription in Hale Kannada script.Kamath (2001), p58 Copper plates and manuscripts Badami Chalukya inscription in Old Kannada, Virupaksha Temple, 745 Pattadakal Examples of early Sanskrit-Kannada bilingual copper plate inscriptions (tamarashaasana) are the Tumbula inscriptions of the Western Ganga Dynasty dated 444 ADIn bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, the rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The two languages of many such inscriptions were Sanskrit and the regional language such as Tamil or Kannada (Thapar 2003, pp393-394) The earliest full-length Kannada tamarashaasana in Old Kannada script (early 8th century) belongs to Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, South Kanara district and displays the double crested fish, his royal emblem.Gururaj Bhat in Kamath (2001), p97 The oldest well-preserved palm leaf manuscript is in Old Kannada and is that of Dhavala, dated to around the 9th century, preserved in the Jain Bhandar, Mudbidri, Dakshina Kannada district. The manuscript contains 1478 leaves written in ink. =History of Telugu= Origins Telugu is hypothesised to have originated from a reconstructed Proto-Dravidian language. It is a highly Sanskritised language; as Telugu scholar C.P Brown states in page 266 of his book A Grammar of the Telugu language: \\"if we ever make any real progress in the language the student will require the aid of the Sanskrit Dictionary\\". Prakrit Inscriptions containing Telugu words dated around 400–100 BCE were discovered in Bhattiprolu in District of Guntur. English translation of one inscription as reads: \\"Gift of the slab by venerable Midikilayakha\\". Stages From 575 CE, we begin to find traces of Telugu in inscriptions and literature, it is possible to broadly define four stages in the linguistic history of the Telugu language: =575 –1100 CE= The first inscription that is entirely in Telugu corresponds to the second phase of Telugu history. This inscription, dated 575 CE, was found in the districts of Kadapa and Kurnool and is attributed to the Renati Cholas, who broke with the prevailing practice of using Prakrit and began writing royal proclamations in the local language. During the next fifty years, Telugu inscriptions appeared in Anantapuram and other neighboring regions. The earliest dated Telugu inscription from coastal Andhra Pradesh comes from about 633 CE. Around the same time, the Chalukya kings of Telangana also began using Telugu for inscriptions. Telugu was more influenced by Sanskrit than Prakrit during this period, which corresponded to the advent of Telugu literature. This literature was initially found in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of the rulers, and later in written works such as Nannayya's Mahabharatam (1022 CE). During the time of Nannayya, the literary language diverged from the popular language. This was also a period of phonetic changes in the spoken language. =1100 CE – 1400 CE= The third phase is marked by further stylization and sophistication of the literary language. Ketana (13th century CE) in fact prohibited the use of the vernacular in poetic works. During this period the divergence of the Telugu script from the common Telugu-Kannada script took place. Tikkana wrote his works in this script. =1400–1900= Telugu underwent a great deal of change (as did other Indian languages), progressing from medieval to modern. The language of the Telangana region started to split into a distinct dialect due to Muslim influence: Sultanate rule under the Tughlaq dynasty had been established earlier in the northern Deccan during the 14th century CE. South of the Krishna River (in the Rayalaseema region), however, the Vijayanagara empire gained dominance from 1336 CE till the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered to be its golden age.APonline – History and Culture-Languages Padakavithapithamaha, Annamayya, contributed many atcha (pristine) Telugu Padaalu to this great language. In the latter half of the 17th century, Muslim rule extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the princely state of Hyderabad by the Asaf Jah dynasty in 1724 CE. This heralded an era of Persian/Arabic influence on the Telugu language, especially on that spoken by the inhabitants of Hyderabad. The effect is also felt in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the Kaifiyats. =1900 to date= The period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the influence of the English language and modern communication/printing press as an effect of the British rule, especially in the areas that were part of the Madras Presidency. Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by scholars like Kandukuri Viresalingam, Gurazada Apparao, and Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao. Since the 1930s, what was considered an elite literary form of the Telugu language has now spread to the common people with the introduction of mass media like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools as a standard. In the current decade the Telugu language, like other Indian languages, has undergone globalization due to the increasing settlement of Telugu-speaking people abroad. Modern Telugu movies, although still retaining their dramatic quality, are linguistically separate from post-Independence films. At present, a committee of scholars have approved a classical language tag for Telugu based on its antiquity. The Indian government has also officially designated it as a classical language. Carnatic music Though Carnatic music, one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions, has a profound cultural influence on all of the South Indian states and their respective languages, most songs (Kirtanas) are in Kannada and Telugu. Purandara Dasa, said to have composed at least a quarter million songs and known as the \\"father\\" of Carnatic music composed in Kannada. The region to the east of Tamil Nadu stretching from Tanjore in the south to Andhra Pradesh in the north was known as the Carnatic region during 17th and 18th centuries. The Carnatic war in which Robert Clive annexed Trichirapali is relevant. The music that prevailed in this region during the 18th century onwards was known as Carnatic music. This is because the existing tradition is to a great extent an outgrowth of the musical life of the principality of Thanjavur in the Kaveri delta. Thanjavur was the heart of the Chola dynasty (from the 9th century to the 13th), but in the second quarter of the 16th century a Telugu Nayak viceroy (Raghunatha Nayaka) was appointed by the emperor of Vijayanagara, thus establishing a court whose language was Telugu. The Nayaks acted as governors of what is present-day Tamil Nadu with their headquarters at Thanjavur (1530–1674 CE) and Madurai(1530–1781 CE). After the collapse of Vijayanagar, Thanjavur and Madurai Nayaks became independent and ruled for the next 150 years until they were replaced by Marathas. This was the period when several Telugu families migrated from Andhra and settled down in Thanjavur and Madurai. Most great composers of Carnatic music belonged to these Telugu families. Telugu words end in vowels which many consider a mellifluous quality and thus suitable for musical expression. Of the trinity of Carnatic music composers, Tyagaraja's and Syama Sastri's compositions were largely in Telugu, while Muttuswami Dikshitar is noted for his Sanskrit texts. Tyagaraja is remembered both for his devotion and the bhava of his krithi, a song form consisting of pallavi, (the first section of a song) anupallavi (a rhyming section that follows the pallavi) and charanam (a sung stanza which serves as a refrain for several passages in the composition). The texts of his kritis are almost all in Sanskrit, in Telugu (the contemporary language of the court). This use of a living language, as opposed to Sanskrit, the language of ritual, is in keeping with the bhakti ideal of the immediacy of devotion. Sri Syama Sastri, the oldest of the trinity, was taught Telugu and Sanskrit by his father, who was the pujari (Hindu priest) at the Meenakshi temple in Madurai. Syama Sastri's texts were largely composed in Telugu, widening their popular appeal. Some of his most famous compositions include the nine krithis, Navaratnamaalikā, in praise of the goddess Meenakshi at Madurai, and his eighteen krithi in praise of Kamakshi. As well as composing krithi, he is credited with turning the svarajati, originally used for dance, into a purely musical form. =History of Malayalam= Malayalam is thought to have diverged from approximately the 6th century in the region coinciding with modern Kerala. The development of Malayalam as a separate language was characterized by a moderate influence from Sanskrit, both in lexicon and grammar, which culminated in the Aadhyaathma Ramayanam, a version of the Ramayana by Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan which marked the beginning of modern Malayalam. Ezhuthachan's works also cemented the use of the Malayalam script, an alphabet blending the Tamil Vatteluttu alphabet with elements of the Grantha script resulting in a large number of letters capable of representing both Indo-Aryan and Dravidian sounds. Today, it is considered one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and was declared a classical language by the Government of India in 2013. Languages of other families in India =Sino-Tibetan languages= Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken in the western Himalayas (Himachal Pradesh) and in the highlands of Northeast India. The Sino-Tibetan family includes such languages as Meithei, Bodo, Naga and Garo. Some of the languages traditionally included in Sino-Tibetan may actually be language isolates or part of small independent language families. =Austroasiatic languages= The Austroasiatic family spoken in East and North-east India. Austroasiatic languages include the Santal and Munda languages of eastern India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, and the Mon–Khmer languages spoken by the Khasi and Nicobarese in India and in Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and southern China. The Austroasiatic languages arrived in east India around 4000-3500 ago from Southeast Asia.Sidwell, Paul. 2018. Austroasiatic Studies: state of the art in 2018. Presentation at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, 22 May 2018. =Great Andamanese and Ongan languages= On the Andaman Islands, language from at least two families have spoken: the Great Andamanese languages and the Ongan languages. The Sentinelese language is spoken on North Sentinel Island, but contact has not been made with the Sentinelis; thus, its language affiliation is unknown. While Joseph Greenberg considered the Great Andamanese languages to be part of a larger Indo-Pacific family, it was not established through the comparative method but considered spurious by historical linguists. Stephen Wurm suggests similarities with Trans-New Guinea languages and others are caused by a linguistic substrate.Wurm, S.A. (1977: 929). New Guinea Area Languages and Language Study, Volume 1: Papuan Languages and the New Guinea Linguistic Scene. Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University, Canberra. Juliette Blevins has suggested that the Ongan languages are the sister branch to the Austronesian languages in an Austronesian-Ongan family because of sound correspondences between protolanguages. =Isolates= The Nihali language is a language isolate spoken in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Affiliations have been suggested to the Munda languages but they have yet to be demonstrated. Scripts =Indus= Spread of scripts in Asia. The Indus script is the short strings of symbols associated with the Harappan civilization of ancient India (most of the Indus sites are distributed in present-day Pakistan and northwest India) used between 2600–1900 BCE, which evolved from an early Indus script attested from around 3500–3300 BCE. Found in at least a dozen types of context, the symbols are most commonly associated with flat, rectangular stone tablets called seals. The first publication of a Harappan seal was a drawing by Alexander Cunningham in 1875. Since then, well over 4000 symbol-bearing objects have been discovered, some as far afield as Mesopotamia. After 1500 BCE, coinciding with the final stage of Harappan civilization, use of the symbols ends. There are over 400 distinct signs, but many are thought to be slight modifications or combinations of perhaps 200 'basic' signs. The symbols remain undeciphered (in spite of numerous attempts that did not find favour with the academic community), and some scholars classify them as proto-writing rather than writing proper. =Brāhmī= The best-known inscriptions in Brāhmī are the rock-cut edicts of Ashoka, dating to the 3rd century BCE. These were long considered the earliest examples of Brāhmī writing, but recent archaeological evidence in Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu suggest the dates for the earliest use of Tamil Brāhmī to be around the 6th century BCE, dated using radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating methods. This script is ancestral to the Brahmic family of scripts, most of which are used in South and Southeast Asia, but which have wider historical use elsewhere, even as far as Mongolia and perhaps even Korea, according to one theory of the origin of Hangul. The Brāhmī numeral system is the ancestor of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, which are now used worldwide. Brāhmī is generally believed to be derived from a Semitic script such as the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, as was clearly the case for the contemporary Kharosthi alphabet that arose in a part of northwest Indian under the control of the Achaemenid Empire. Rhys Davids suggests that writing may have been introduced to India from the Middle East by traders. Another possibility is with the Achaemenid conquest in the late 6th century BCE. It was often assumed that it was a planned invention under Ashoka as a prerequisite for his edicts. Compare the much better-documented parallel of the Hangul script. Older examples of the Brahmi script appear to be on fragments of pottery from the trading town of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, which have been dated to the early 400 BCE. Even earlier evidence of the Tamil -Brahmi script has been discovered on pieces of pottery in Adichanallur, Tamil Nadu. Radio-carbon dating has established that they belonged to the 6th- century BCE. A minority position holds that Brāhmī was a purely indigenous development, perhaps with the Indus script as its predecessor; these include the English scholars G.R. Hunter and F. Raymond Allchin. =Kharoṣṭhī= Paper strip with writing in Kharoṣṭhī. 2nd to 5th century CE, Yingpan, Eastern Tarim Basin, Xinjiang Museum. The Kharoṣṭhī script, also known as the Gāndhārī script, is an ancient abugida (a kind of alphabetic script) used by the Gandhara culture of ancient northwest India to write the Gāndhārī and Sanskrit languages. It was in use from the 4th century BCE until it died out in its homeland around the 3rd century CE. It was also in use along the Silk Road where there is some evidence it may have survived until the 7th century CE in the remote way stations of Khotan and Niya. Scholars are not in agreement as to whether the Kharoṣṭhī script evolved gradually, or was the work of a mindful inventor. An analysis of the script forms shows a clear dependency on the Aramaic alphabet but with extensive modifications to support the sounds found in Indian languages. One model is that the Aramaic script arrived with the Achaemenid conquest of the region in 500 BCE and evolved over the next 200+ years to reach its final form by the 3rd century BCE. However, no Aramaic documents of any kind have survived from this period. Also intermediate forms have yet been found to confirm this evolutionary model, and rock and coins inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE onward show a unified and mature form. The study of the Kharoṣṭhī script was recently invigorated by the discovery of the Gandharan Buddhist Texts, a set of birch-bark manuscripts written in Kharoṣṭhī, discovered near the Afghan city of Haḍḍā (compare Panjabi HAḌḌ ਹੱਡ s. m. \\"A bone, especially a big bone of dead cattle\\" referring to the famous mortuary grounds if the area): just west of the Khyber Pass. The manuscripts were donated to the British Library in 1994. The entire set of manuscripts are dated to the 1st century CE making them the oldest Buddhist manuscripts in existence. =Gupta= The Gupta script was used for writing Sanskrit and is associated with the Gupta Empire of India which was a period of material prosperity and great religious and scientific developments. The Gupta script was descended from Brahmi and gave rise to the Siddham script and then Bengali-Assamese script. =Siddhaṃ= A replica of Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sūtra manuscript in Siddham on palm-leaf in 609 CE. Hōryū-ji, Japan. The last line is a complete Sanskrit syllabary in Siddhaṃ script Siddhaṃ (Sanskrit, accomplished or perfected), descended from the Brahmi script via the Gupta script, which also gave rise to the Devanāgarī script as well as a number of other Asian scripts such as Tibetan script. Siddhaṃ is an abugida or alphasyllabary rather than an alphabet because each character indicates a syllable. If no other mark occurs then the short 'a' is assumed. Diacritic marks indicate the other vowels, the pure nasal (anusvara), and the aspirated vowel (visarga). A special mark (virama), can be used to indicate that the letter stands alone with no vowel which sometimes happens at the end of Sanskrit words. See links below for examples. The writing of mantras and copying of Sutras using the Siddhaṃ script is still practiced in Shingon Buddhism in Japan but has died out in other places. It was Kūkai who introduced the Siddham script to Japan when he returned from China in 806, where he studied Sanskrit with Nalanda trained monks including one known as Prajñā. Sutras that were taken to China from India were written in a variety of scripts, but Siddham was one of the most important. By the time Kūkai learned this script the trading and pilgrimage routes overland to India, part of the Silk Road, were closed by the expanding Islamic empire of the Abbasids. Then in the middle of the 9th century, there were a series of purges of \\"foreign religions\\" in China. This meant that Japan was cut off from the sources of Siddham texts. In time other scripts, particularly Devanagari replaced it in India, and so Japan was left as the only place where Siddham was preserved, although it was, and is only used for writing mantras and copying sutras. Siddhaṃ was influential in the development of the Kana writing system, which is also associated with Kūkaiwhile the Kana shapes derive from Chinese characters, the principle of a syllable-based script and their systematic ordering was taken over from Siddham. =Nagari= Descended from the Siddham script around the 11th century.

The name refers to its Rear wheel drive design and Full Electronic control system.http://www.allpar.com/mopar/transmissions/545RFE.html 45RFE and 545RFE The 45RFE was introduced in the Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1999, it is notable for including three planetary gearsets rather than the two normally used in a 4-speed automatic. It also features three multiple disc input clutches, three multiple disc holding clutches, and a dual internal filter system (one primary filter for transmission sump, one for the fluid cooler return system). In the 45RFE applications four gears are utilized, with a different (1.50:1 rather than 1.67:1) second gear to increase versatility when downshifting. In 545RFE usage, an extra taller overdrive ratio is also used. Chrysler decided to refer to it as a \\"multi-speed automatic\\". The 45RFE was produced at the Indiana Transmission plant in Kokomo, Indiana. It was normally paired with the 4.7 L PowerTech V8. The 45RFE later became the 5-speed 545RFE. *Gear Ratios: **1st 3.00:1 **2nd 1.67:1 **2nd Prime 1.50:1 **3rd 1.00:1 **4th 0.75:1 **Reverse 3.00:1 *545RFE only: **5th 0.67:1 Applications: * 45RFE ** 1999–2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee (4.7L) ** 2002–early 2003 Jeep Liberty (3.7L) ** 2000–2002 Dodge Dakota (4.7L) and \\"(3.9L) sport edition Dakota\\" ** 2000–2002 Dodge Durango (4.7L) ** 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 (3.7L and 4.7) * 545RFE ** 2001–2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee (4.7L, 4.7L H.O.,5.7L Hemi, 6.4L Hemi) ** 2005–2006 Jeep Liberty (Diesel applications) ** 2003–2011 Dodge Ram (3.7L, 4.7L, 5.7L Hemi) ** 2005–2011 Dodge Power Wagon ** 2003–2011 Dodge Dakota (4.7L, 4.7L H.O.) ** 2003–2011 Dodge Durango (4.7L, 5.7L) ** 2006–2010 Jeep Commander (4.7L, 5.7L Hemi) ** 2007–2010 Jeep Wrangler (2.8 L CRD) ** 2007–present LTI/London Taxi Company TX4 ** 2007-2009 Chrysler Aspen (4.7L, 5.7L Hemi) 68RFE The 68RFE was introduced in 2007 Ram 2500 and 3500 Pickups with the 6.7L Cummins ISB Diesel engine.

With the exception of an improved torque converter, it is physically the same as its predecessor. The key difference in the 65RFE is the ability to use all six forward gears in sequence when using Electronic Range Select mode. In normal drive mode, however, the 65RFE uses the shift pattern of the 545RFE; thus never using 2nd and 3rd gears in succession. 2500 and 3500 models with gas engines received the 66RFE, a hybrid of 68RFE internals (including the gearset) packaged in a 545RFE case.

Depending on year and application, it can either be a stand-alone module or integrated with the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The TCM uses data from various transmission and engine sensors to control transmission shifting. The TCM operates the solenoid pack to change hydraulic flow through the valve body to various clutches in the transmission. The solenoid pack is mounted directly to the valve body; its connector protrudes from a hole on the left side of the transmission. On the 45 and 545RFE the hydraulic control system design (without electronic assist) provides the transmission with PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, SECOND, and THIRD gears, based solely on driver shift lever selection. This design allows the vehicle to be driven (in “limp-in” mode) in the event of an electronic control system failure, or a situation that the Transmission Control Module (TCM) recognizes as potentially damaging to the transmission. On the 68RFE, fourth gear is used for limp-in instead of second and third. All RFE transmissions use Mopar ATF +4. Service fill is 6–8 quarts + transmission filter.

The thermal mass and conductivity of the element regulate the rate flow of heat into the element. All heat detectors have this thermal lag. Heat detectors have two main classifications of operation, \\"rate- of-rise\\" and \\"fixed temperature\\". The heat detector is used to help in the reduction of property damage. Fixed temperature heat detectors This is the most common type of heat detector. Fixed temperature detectors operate when the heat sensitive eutectic alloy reaches the eutectic point changing state from a solid to a liquid. Thermal lag delays the accumulation of heat at the sensitive element so that a fixed-temperature device will reach its operating temperature sometime after the surrounding air temperature exceeds that temperature. The most common fixed temperature point for electrically connected heat detectors is 58°C (136.4°F). Rate-of-rise heat detectors Rate-of-Rise (ROR) heat detectors operate on a rapid rise in element temperature of 6.7° to 8.3°C (12° to 15°F) increase per minute, irrespective of the starting temperature. This type of heat detector can operate at a lower temperature fire condition than would be possible if the threshold were fixed. It has two heat-sensitive thermocouples or thermistors. One thermocouple monitors heat transferred by convection or radiation while the other responds to ambient temperature. The detector responds when the first sensing element's temperature increases relative to the other. Rate of rise detectors may not respond to low energy release rates of slowly developing fires. To detect slowly developing fires combination detectors add a fixed temperature element that will ultimately respond when the fixed temperature element reaches the design threshold. Heat detector selection Heat detectors commonly have a label on them that reads \\"Not a life safety device\\". That is because heat detectors are not meant to replace smoke detectors in the bedrooms or in the hallway outside of the bedrooms. A heat detector will nonetheless notify of a fire in a kitchen or utility area, e.g., laundry room, garage, or attic, where smoke detectors should not be installed as dust or other particles would affect the smoke detector and cause false alarms. This will allow extra time to evacuate the building or to put out the fire, if possible. Mechanical heat detectors are independent fire warning stations that — unlike smoke detectors — can be installed in any area of a home. Portability, ease of installation, and excellent performance and reliability make this a good choice for residential fire protection when combined with the required smoke detectors. Because the detectors are not interconnected, heat activation identifies the location of the fire, facilitating evacuation from the home. Each type of heat detector has its advantages, and it cannot be said that one type of heat detector should always be used instead of another. If one were to place a rate-of-rise heat detector above a large, closed oven, then every time the door is opened a nuisance alarm could be generated due to the sudden heat transient. In this circumstance the fixed threshold detector would probably be best. If a room filled with highly combustible materials is protected with a fixed heat detector, then a fast-flaming fire could exceed the alarm threshold due to thermal lag. In that case the rate-of-rise heat detector may be preferred.

During his career, he recorded with Linda Ronstadt, Karla Bonoff, Andrew Gold, Olivia Newton-John, Peter Cetera, Anne Murray, Warren Zevon and Dan Fogelberg, among many others. He also contributed to several soundtracks for films, and to albums released under the name of The Simpsons. Although known primarily as a drummer, Botts also contributed backing vocals to some Bread songs. Career Born in Oakland, California, Botts grew up in nearby Antioch before moving to Sacramento. While in college, he began playing with a band called The Travellers Three and working as a studio musician. Eventually, the group disbanded, but not before recording some songs with producer David Gates. While working with Bill Medley, Botts was invited to join Gates's band, Bread, for its second album, On the Waters. He accepted the offer and worked as a full-time member of Bread from 1970 to 1973, when the band went on hiatus. At that point, Botts began working with Linda Ronstadt, and recorded and toured with her for over two years. Botts reunited with the other members of Bread in 1976 for one final album and tour, before disbanding again in 1978. He then worked with Karla Bonoff and Andrew Gold, playing on Gold's 1977 hit \\"Lonely Boy\\", and continued to work in the studio as a player, singer, writer, and producer. In 1989, he toured Japan with Richard Carpenter. Two years later, he began touring and recording with Dan Fogelberg while continuing his session work, and also writing jingles and music for children's albums. In 1996, the members of Bread again reunited for a world tour that ran until the fall of 1997. Botts then recorded his only solo album, Adults Only, released in 2000. Botts died in Burbank, California, one day after his 61st birthday, having suffered from colon cancer.

They include the ventral basal ganglia (including nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum), nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in the production of acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system (CNS) centred on the output of the nucleus basalis. The presence of non-cholinergic neurons projecting to the cortex have been found to act with the cholinergic neurons to dynamically modulate activity in the cortex. Function Acetylcholine is known to promote wakefulness in the basal forebrain. Stimulating the basal forebrain gives rise to acetylcholine release, which induces wakefulness and REM sleep, whereas inhibition of acetylcholine release in the basal forebrain by adenosine causes slow wave sleep. The nucleus basalis is the main neuromodulator of the basal forebrain and gives widespread cholinergic projections to the neocortex. The nucleus basalis is an essential part of the neuromodulatory system that controls behaviour by regulating arousal and attention. The nucleus basalis is also seen to be a critical node in the memory circuit. The importance of non-cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain structures has been shown in working together with the cholinergic neurons in a dynamically modulatory way. This is seen to play a significant role in cognitive functions. Adenosine acts on A1 receptors of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. This results in hyperpolarization of cholinergic neurons, which inhibits the release of acetylcholine. Nitric oxide production in the basal forebrain is both necessary and sufficient to produce sleep.Need To Pull An All-nighter? Reducing Nitric Oxide Gas In The Brain May Help Us Stay Awake Clinical significance Acetylcholine affects the ability of brain cells to transmit information to one another, and also encourages neuronal plasticity, or learning. Thus, damage to the basal forebrain can reduce the amount of acetylcholine in the brain and impair learning. This may be one reason why basal forebrain damage can result in memory impairments such as amnesia and confabulation. One common cause of basal forebrain damage is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. It is thought that damage to the nucleus basalis and its cortical projections are implicated in forms of dementia, notably Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia. There have been studies on the use of deep brain stimulation to the nucleus basalis, in the treatment of dementia, and while giving some positive results trials are still being undertaken.

It can be a mild disease or cause blindness. CEA is caused by a simple autosomal recessive gene defect. There is no treatment. Affected breeds It is known to occur in Scotch Collies (smooth and rough collies), Shetland Sheepdogs, Australian Shepherds, Border Collies, Lancashire Heelers, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers. Frequency is high in Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs, and low in Border Collies and NSDTRs. In the United States, incidence in the genotype of collies has been estimated to be as high as 95 percent, with a phenotypic incidence of 80 to 85 percent. Pathogenesis CEA is caused by improper development of the eye. Failure of the cells of the posterior portion of the optic vesicles to express growth hormone affects the differentiation of other cells of the eye. The choroid, especially lateral to the optic disc, is hypoplastic (underdeveloped). A coloboma, or hole, may form in or near the optic disc due to a failed closure of embryonic tissue. The degree of these abnormalities varies between individual dogs, and even between the same dog's eyes. CEA is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that has a penetrance reaching 100 percent, and has been localized to canine chromosome 37. Signs The most common sign of CEA is the presence of an area of undeveloped choroid (appearing as a pale spot) lateral to the optic disc. The choroid is a collection of blood vessels supplying the retina. CEA can also cause retinal or scleral coloboma, coloboma of the optic disc, retinal detachment, or intraocular hemorrhage. It can be diagnosed by fundoscopy by the age of six or seven weeks. Severe cases may be blind. Breeding and testing Controversies exist around eliminating this disorder from breeding Collies. Some veterinarians advocate only breeding dogs with no evidence of disease, but this would eliminate a large portion of potential breeding stock. Because of this, others recommend only breeding mildly affected dogs, but this would never completely eradicate the condition. Also, mild cases of choroidal hypoplasia may become pigmented and therefore undiagnosable by the age of three to seven months. If puppies are not checked for CEA before this happens, they may be mistaken for normal and bred as such. Checking for CEA by seven weeks of age can eliminate this possibility. Diagnosis is also difficult in dogs with coats of dilute color because lack of pigment in the choroid of these animals can be confused with choroidal hypoplasia. Also, because of the lack of choroidal pigment, mild choroidal hypoplasia is difficult to see, and therefore cases of CEA may be missed. Until recently, the only way to know if a dog was a carrier was for it to produce an affected puppy. However, a genetic test for CEA became available at the beginning of 2005, developed by the Baker Institute for Animal Health, Cornell University, and administered through OptiGen. The test can determine whether a dog is affected, a carrier, or clear, and is therefore a useful tool in determining a particular dog's suitability for breeding.

Initially called Cottonwood River State Park, it was renamed in 1945 to honor Charles Eugene Flandrau, a leading citizen of early Minnesota who commanded defenses during the Battles of New Ulm in the Dakota War of 1862. The park was originally developed in the 1930s as a job creation project to provide a recreational reservoir. However the dam was repeatedly damaged by floods and was removed in 1995. Along with the dam, crews from the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) built several structures in the National Park Service rustic style. In a unique twist on the mandate to harmonize with the local environment, the buildings were designed to reflect the ethnic German heritage of New Ulm. The WPA barracks were reused during World War II as Camp New Ulm, housing German prisoners of war. All of these structures are listed as a district on the National Register of Historic Places. Natural history =Geography= Flandrau State Park lies in a small valley carved by the east- flowing Cottonwood River. Marshy oxbow lakes mark the river's former courses along the valley floor. The steep valley walls rise . The Cottonwood joins the Minnesota River just east of the park. It originates west of the park in Lyon County, Minnesota. The park boundary largely follows the valley rim. Trees on the slopes generally screen the adjacent development. The northern end of the park, including the campground, is within the city limits of New Ulm. No bridges cross the river within Flandrau, so the parkland on the south bank is not readily accessible. The only development there, the group center, is at the end of a gated road. =Geology= Flandrau State Park lies atop a bedrock of shale, sandstone, and conglomerate. These sediments accumulated at the bottom of the Western Interior Seaway 100 million years ago during the late Cretaceous period. The fine-grained sandstone is white with bands of orange from iron oxide, and contains fossilized plant material. The conglomerate contains pebbles of granite that had formed 3,000–2,500 million years ago and later eroded into the seaway. Lying directly atop the Cretaceous rocks is till just a few thousand years old. All intermediate rock had eroded away before the till was deposited in a ground moraine by continental glaciers. Within Flandrau State Park this glacial debris is thick. While the till contains some rock from Canada and northern Minnesota, most is from the local region. Numerous springs emerge at the base of the till slopes, especially at the western end of the park. As the northern glaciers melted, the massive Glacial River Warren carved a deep channel for itself. The modern Minnesota River follows the same course, but occupies only a fraction of the former riverbed. Its tributaries must drop from the surrounding plains into the broad valley to reach their base level. This is why the Cottonwood River, a placid prairie stream for most of its length, plunges into such a deep valley near its mouth. The Cottonwood's downcutting has carved all the way through the thick glacial till and a few feet into the Cretaceous bedrock below. There may once have been a waterfall on the Cottonwood River, which eroded into rapids before achieving the steady gradient of modern times. =Flora= The vegetation of Flandrau State Park is representative of the Upper Minnesota River Country Biocultural Region. Although the surrounding tallgrass prairie is gone, the forested river valley remains similar to times before European settlement. The valley floor supports marshes and wet prairie interspersed with bottomland hardwood forest of willow, eastern cottonwood, American elm, silver maple, and green ash. The steep valley walls bear northern hardwood forest, although the cooler, moister north-facing slopes favor sugar maple, basswood, and common hackberry while the drier south slopes are characterized by bur oak, eastern red cedar, and aspen. A few dry, sunny knolls support prairie characterized by big bluestem and indian grass. The park's plant communities have been altered since Euro-American settlement. Without periodic wildfires to thin woody plants, the valleyside forests have gotten denser and many prairie openings have filled in with sumac. Many elm trees were lost to Dutch elm disease. The valley floor is largely secondary forest, having been cleared for agriculture and then submerged under a reservoir. =Fauna= Surrounded by human development, Flandrau is an important refuge for local wildlife. The 25 species of mammals seen in the park include white-tailed deer, coyotes, gray foxes, raccoons, beavers, skunks, opossums, and minks. Over 60 species of birds have been documented in the park. Most of these are songbirds migrating through rather than nesting. These include many warblers, flycatchers, vireos, and thrushes. The Cottonwood River supports a few game fish — notably northern pike and smallmouth bass — and a greater variety of rough fish. Cultural history Archaeological evidence found outside the park confirms that prehistoric Native Americans inhabited the Cottonwood River valley. A few sites were as much as 7,000 years old, though most were 2,000 years old or less. At the time of European contact in the mid-17th century the area was home to the Dakota. Pioneers began settling the Cottonwood Valley in the 1830s. In less than a century, though, the valley floor was largely abandoned due to the periodic flooding. =State park creation= To help combat unemployment during the Great Depression, federal funding was dedicated to park development throughout the United States. The Cottonwood River valley was selected as it was in a well-populated region with no other large recreational area or lakes. Moreover, the land was largely abandoned and seemingly in need of flood control structures. The state of Minnesota purchased the property in 1934. The first Works Progress Administration (WPA) enrollees arrived in September, living in tents while they built bunkhouses, a mess hall, and an administrative building over the winter. Mostly middle-aged skilled workers, the WPA men quarried stone and constructed three park buildings: a beachhouse, a manager's residence, and a garage. A second workforce arrived in June 1935, establishing its own camp in the southwest corner of the park. These were less-skilled workers hired through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). They built the dam and its earthen dikes, constructed a kitchen shelter, landscaped, planted trees, and blazed trails. WPA and CCC workers cleared trees out of the lakebed. For the first year the laborers were World War I veterans from the Veterans Conservation Corps (VCC). In July 1936 they transferred to other Minnesota state parks and were replaced with the unemployed young men more typical of CCC projects. The dam, completed in 1937 after two years of work, impounded a reservoir of . The WPA continued to work in the park until 1941 and the CCC until 1942. As planned, the WPA camp was converted to a group center while the CCC camp was razed. The stone structures built by the WPA have been called \\" the most unusual architectural designs in the state park system\\" by the Minnesota Historical Society. A principle of the rustic style was to harmonize with the local environment, generally by using local materials. In this case, however, architect Edward W. Barber chose to reflect local culture as well, honoring the strong German heritage of New Ulm. The park buildings evoke the architecture of Germany with steeply pitched roofs, dormers, chimneys, casement windows with small panes, and fine nonlinear stonework. The beachhouse is also one of the largest New Deal structures in the Minnesota state park system. =Camp New Ulm= The park's group center, where German prisoners of war were housed during World War II During World War II, the empty group camp built by the WPA was used to house German prisoners of war in the United States. Late in the war, Great Britain was short on space and resources to provide for captured enemy combatants; meanwhile, much of the U.S. labor force was off serving in the military. The U.S. established camps throughout the country from which 450,000 POWs were employed in non-defense industries. Nine POW camps were established in Minnesota — including one other state park, Whitewater — all managed from a regional headquarters in Algona, Iowa. About 160 German POWs arrived at Camp New Ulm in June 1944. Mostly members of the Luftwaffe (the German Air Force), they ranged in age from 18–25. Twelve men from the U.S. Army served as their guards. The POWs primarily worked in the nearby town of Sleepy Eye at a cannery, which paid the rent on the camp. After the harvest season, prisoners assisted at brick and tile factories and a poultry processing plant. Small groups were hired out to local farms, unguarded, as short-term farmworkers. The POWs spent the winter at regional headquarters in Algona and returned in spring 1945. That year their use on farms expanded considerably, encompassing worksites in eight counties, while prisoners at the cannery were instrumental in packing Sleepy Eye's largest-ever pea crop. The location of Camp New Ulm outside a town with a strong German heritage was a lucky break for the POWs. Many locals still spoke German and were sympathetic toward the prisoners (and hoping in many cases for news of relatives and the old country). German- speaking church officials held Lutheran and Catholic services in the camp and gathered donations of reading material. Although the guards warned civilians that they were not to have contact with the POWs, food was slipped over the fence, cannery workers shared ice cream and beer, and young women waded across the river at night to flirt at the camp's edge. POWs out on weeklong farm details fared best of all, often receiving full home-cooked meals at the family dinner table. Prisoner Helmut Lichtenberg, who had become friendly with a farm family he'd worked for, arranged to slip out of camp and spend much of a weekend with them. Mindless of the severity of the infraction, the farmer and his mother-in-law drove Lichtenberg into camp Sunday afternoon, where they were stopped by guards. Lichtenberg was punished with solitary confinement; the Americans were ultimately both fined $300 and lectured by the judge. Their testimony indicated that other prisoners undertook such forays, but this was the camp's only documented escape incident. For recreation the POWs had a clubhouse with a fireplace and library, a camp store, a sport field, and a workshop where they made their own furniture and sporting equipment. They were allowed to swim and fish in part of Cottonwood Lake. Further entertainments included newspapers, radios, and weekly movie screenings. Some musical instruments were gathered, and locals came to listen and sing along to Sunday afternoon concerts. Camp New Ulm closed in December 1945 and all of the internees were eventually repatriated to Germany. One of the former prisoners later immigrated to the United States, settling in Wisconsin. The camp remains in use as the state park's group center, one of the country's few World War II POW camps that are still maintained. When the camp is not occupied, visitors can ask at the park office to access the grounds. =Recent history= By World War II, sentiment developed for renaming the park after Charles Flandrau (1828–1903), a notable figure in early Minnesota history. A lawyer, indian agent, and statesman, Flandrau served on the territorial supreme court, presided over the first court session in Brown County, and led the military defense of New Ulm during the Dakota War of 1862. The name was changed in March 1945. Two years later the Cottonwood Lake Dam was overtopped and seriously damaged by a flood. It was reconstructed at great expense, but damaged again by flooding in spring 1965. This time federal funds were denied, and the state opted for a shorter dam and a separate swimming pool. However a third damaging flood swept through in 1969. With local opinion divided about reestablishing the recreational lake, the state commissioned an independent study. The engineering consultants reported that, although a restored dam would improve habitat for panfish and block upstream movement of undesirable species such as carp, it would not provide effective flood control. The capacity of the lake basin was too small compared to the watershed, exacerbated by increased agricultural drainage and wetland loss since the original damming in the 1930s. Nor would a new dam be cost-effective for generating hydroelectricity, and the lake would be prone to heavy sedimentation and periods of poor water quality. The director of the state parks division recommended against rebuilding the dam. Some structures remained for several years; full dam removal took place in 1995 and the Cottonwood River is again free-flowing through the park. As an interpretive sign reads, \\"the dam that took almost 200 men nearly two years to build was demolished by four men and heavy equipment in five months.\\" Recreation Flandrau State Park has of trails for hiking, walking, and running. Many connect to city streets such as Indian Point Dr. and Summit Ave., so the park experiences significant walk-in traffic. In winter 6 miles of the trails are groomed for cross-country skiing and 2 miles for snowshoeing. The park maintains three campgrounds with 92 sites total, 34 of which have electrical hookups. There are also three secluded walk-in sites. Visitors can rent two camper cabins or the historic group center, which sleeps up to 110 in eight bunkhouses. The popular day-use area centers around a unique sand-bottomed, chlorinated swimming pool. This is adjacent to the historic beachhouse and a picnic area with a playground, volleyball and horseshoes facilities, and a reservable shelter. Most fishing is done at the downstream end of the Cottonwood River, near the park's eastern edge, where the riverbank is most easily accessed. Flandrau is adjacent to Nehls City Park, the private New Ulm Country Club, and the August Schell Brewing Company. The Hermann Heights Monument and Martin Luther College are within blocks of the park entrance.

It connected Richmond, British Columbia to Downtown Vancouver, with a connection to Vancouver International Airport. It travelled mainly along Granville Street in Vancouver and dedicated bus lane on No. 3 Road in Richmond. It was operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company and was funded by TransLink. The route was long. The line carried over 18,000 passengers daily. It was discontinued on September 7, 2009, two and a half weeks after the opening of the Canada Line, which replaced it. The 98 featured GPS technology, automated stop announcements, specialized bus stop displays that showed the amount of time until the next bus arrives, and special traffic light signals that sustained green lights long enough for buses to pass through. The 98 B-Line had nine stops in Richmond (including the transfer point to the airport) and fourteen stops in Vancouver (including seven stops downtown). Waiting times were approximately five to seven minutes per bus during peak hours and ten minutes per bus during mid-afternoons. In the evening and at night, the waiting time was around fifteen minutes per bus, and in the early morning the waiting time was around 20 to 30 minutes. Total travel time from end to end on the route was approximately 42 minutes, but could increase to one hour during peak hours due to traffic. In Richmond, the 98 B-Line followed a dedicated bus lane separated from mainstream traffic on No. 3 Road, between the Lansdowne and Sea Island Way stops. On February 13, 2006, the 98 B-Line's bus lane in Richmond was closed as utility crews prepared for the construction of the Canada Line along No. 3 Road. Between February 2006 until its discontinuation in September 2009, the 98 B-Line travelled with regular traffic. The route was modelled after the successful 99 B-Line, which operates between University of British Columbia and Commercial–Broadway SkyTrain station. Like its older counterpart, larger articulated buses were normally used for this route, each with a 120-passenger capacity. These buses were built by New Flyer Industries of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Typical 98 B-Line stop information poster History Prior to the introduction of the 98 B-Line, most bus routes in Richmond travelled into Downtown Vancouver during rush hours. These routes stopped at all stops along their routes in Richmond, then would operate along Granville Street in Vancouver as express services. Although the idea of a rapid bus line from Richmond to Vancouver had been discussed for decades, it was first proposed by BC Transit in 1994. In 1995, Vancouver city council approved a southbound high-occupancy vehicle lane for the evening peak hours in the Marpole neighbourhood in preparation for an express bus service. In 1997, the idea of a rapid transit line was re-introduced with the objective of providing the express service at regular fares. A study was done and it was determined that the best route for the line would be through Granville Street in Vancouver. A typical 98 B-Line stop (from Seymour & Davie) The project cost approximately to build; this includes the price of new vehicles, the construction of a dedicated bus lane in Richmond, installing new bus shelters, automated on- board announcements and similar technology, transit priority systems for traffic lights and a share of the new Richmond bus depot, as the old Vancouver Oakridge depot could not accommodate the longer articulated buses used on the route.http://novax.com/products/media/98B-Line%20Final%20Report.pdf The line was officially opened as far as Airport Station on September 4, 2000, later extending into central Richmond on April 9, 2001. With the introduction of the B-Line, almost all other local bus services traveling between Richmond and Vancouver were eliminated, resulting in most commuters having to transfer from a local service to the B-Line. As a result of the added transfer and quicker travel times of the B-Line that did not materialize, commute times for passengers increased even though a commute time savings of several minutes had been promised. Within a few years, rush hours routes were created which effectively restored direct rush hour service from most urban areas of Richmond to Vancouver. The B-line was one of the most used routes in the TransLink system. Around 2002 to 2003, plans to replace the 98 B-Line with a light rail line were being brought up. This new line's working name was the \\"RAV Line\\" (Richmond–Airport–Vancouver). It generated much controversy, mainly due to its estimated cost of $1.72billion. The project was also threatened by political interference from Richmond city council, which had insisted that the line being operated in the city at grade principally because they favored the aesthetic attributes of an at grade line over an above grade line; faced with the majority of public favoring an above grade line and the consideration that an at grade line would increase operating costs and significantly increase trip times, Richmond council backed down. The project was voted down by the TransLink board twice because of political infighting because the board members representing the northeast areas of Greater Vancouver wanted a line built to Coquitlam. The \\"RAV Line\\" project was saved after the board agreed to build both lines by 2010. While not part of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the Canada Line was completed in August 2009, and has now replaced the 98 B-Line. Beginning in February 2008, 98 B-Line route passengers with valid proof of payment were permitted to board using any of the three doors at any stop. To facilitate this, the bus driver controlled the operation of all three doors at each of the stops. Passengers paying cash or validating FareSavers had to board through the front door. The 98 B-Line was discontinued on September 7, 2009, two and a half weeks after the Canada Line opened. Afterwards, the #10 Hastings/Downtown/Granville bus began running more frequently along Granville street to compensate. 98 B-Line stops and transfer points =Downtown Vancouver= * Seymour & Davie – Served the upscale Yaletown neighbourhood.

Constructed in 1901-2 for the University's bicentennial, the limestone Beaux-Arts buildings linked the College buildings on the Old Campus with the Sheffield Scientific buildings on Hillhouse Avenue.

Bicentennial Memorial Rotunda The University Commons, simply known as \\"Commons\\" on campus, is a timber-trussed banqueting hall. It served as the university-wide dining hall until the completion of the residential colleges, Sterling Law Building, and Hall of Graduate Studies in the 1930s. Woolsey Hall was the University's first large secular assembly hall, with 2,691 seats. It holds one of the largest organs in the world: the Newberry Memorial Organ, a 1928 Skinner organ. The Rotunda, with tablets on the walls commemorating Yale's war dead is a double-sized, domed, colonnaded version of Bramante's Tempietto built in 1502 on the site of St. Peter's martyrdom in Rome. Above the memorial is the President's Room, used for donor and ceremonial receptions. =Woodbridge Hall= Also completed in 1901, Woodbridge Hall is the main administrative building of the university. The Office of the President of the University has been stationed on the building's second floor since the administration of Arthur Twining Hadley. Adjacent is the Corporation Room, the boardroom of Yale's governing body. The building is named for Timothy Woodbridge, one of the ten founding ministers of the school, whose names of are engraved on the building's facade. =Beinecke Library= The visible portion of Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, on the east side of the plaza, designed by Gordon Bunshaft, is like the visible portion of an iceberg. With three underground levels extending under the plaza, most of the library is hidden. Sculpture Yale University World War I Cenotaph Before the colonnade of the Commons is a memorial cenotaph. Its inscription reads: Behind the cenotaph, one can see inscribed the names of World War I battles of Cambrai, Argonne, Somme, Chateau-Thierry, Ypres, St. Mihiel and Marne. Woodbridge Hall, located on the west side of the plaza, was designed by the firm of Howells & Stokes and is French Renaissance in style. It contains the central administration of the University. The building was named for Reverend Timothy Woodbridge, one of the founders of Yale College. The Beinecke Library's sunken courtyard, visible but not accessible from the plaza, contains Isamu Noguchi's sculpture The Garden (Pyramid, Sun, and Cube). The three marble sculptures represent time, the sun, and chance. Alexander Calder's sculpture Gallows and Lollipops stands on the plaza. The Claes Oldenburg sculpture Lipstick Ascending on a Caterpillar Tread (now located in Morse College) was once on the plaza. Use As the symbolic heart of the university—and as the space in front of the administration building—Beinecke Plaza is occasionally the site of rallies and protests. These have included labor rallies held by the Federation of Hospital and University Employees and their supporters. Student protests have included a 16-day occupation of the plaza by Students Against Sweatshops in support of an ethical licensing policy (spring 2002). Most notable was the 1986 construction of a shanty-town erected to demand Yale's divestment from apartheid South Africa. After students erected the shanty-town, designed to mimic a Soweto shanty and named after Winnie Mandela, the university administration ordered its removal and demolished it. The destruction of the shanty-town, which required the arrest of dozens of protesters, unleashed an outpouring of anger and demands that the shanty-town be recreated. Eventually the university relented and the town was resurrected, only to be burned down by an irate alumnus two years later and replaced by a \\"memorial wall\\".

As the eldest child of a family without male issue, Margaret was expected to inherit from her father until her stepmother Isabel le Despenser gave him a son.  Ancestry  She was the granddaughter and heir-general of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley; however, the Barony and castle of Berkeley had passed to his nephew James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley on his death in 1417. These lands were also claimed by her mother, to whom she and her two sisters were coheirs. Her paternal grandfather was Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, who fought for John of Gaunt in Spain and imprisoned in the Tower of London by Richard II and pardoned by Henry IV. However he died 3 years before Margaret was born.John Ashdown-Hill, \\"Eleanor The Secret Queen\\", Page 22 The History Press, 2009  Marriage  On 6 September 1425 she had married John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury; he and her two brothers-in-law, the Duke of Somerset and the Baron Latimer, vigorously maintained the claim to the Berkeley lands. However, Latimer's claim was possessed by his brother, the Earl of Salisbury, as Latimer had been declared insane.David Baldwin. The Kingmaker’s Sisters: Six Powerful Women in the Wars of the Roses, The History Press; First Edition, 1 August 2009.

She married John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Lord and Lady Talbot were distantly related to each other, having a shared ancestor in King Edward I and both being descendants of the houses of Clare and Despenser. She received the title of Countess of Clermont through the bravery of her husband during the wars with France.John Ashdown-Hill, \\"Eleanor The Secret Queen\\", Page 21 The History Press, 2009  Wars of the Roses  During the troubled years of the Wars of the Roses, the dispute frequently passed from litigation to actual violence. Lord Berkeley sacked Margaret's manor at Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, in return for which her son, the Viscount Lisle, stormed Berkeley Castle (1452) and took him prisoner. Margaret also succeeded in having Lord Berkeley's wife, Lady Isabel Mowbray, committed to prison, where she died that year.  Litigation from her Deathbed  Lord Berkeley married Lady Joan Talbot, Margaret's stepdaughter, in 1457, temporarily quelling the feud. It broke out again in 1463, when William Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley, acceded. Litigation continued, and on her death in 1468, she left her claims to her grandson Thomas Talbot, 2nd Viscount Lisle. She was buried in St Faith under St Paul's at London.Camden, p. 335 Ancestry Notes References * Camden, William. \\"Of the Antiquity of Epitaphs in England.\\" A Collection of Curious Discourses.

The street is named after George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, Foreign Secretary at the time of the cession of Hong Kong Island to the United Kingdom in 1842. History In the early days after 1841, while Choong Wan was planned to be business centre of Victoria City and an area of Westener population, Chinese population was removed from Choong Wan to the area around Tai Ping Shan Street in Sheung Wan and Sheung Wan became the area of Chinese population. South of Hollywood Road was the Alice Memorial Hospital and the College of Medicine where Sun Yat-sen graduated with distinction in 1892. After the college was merged into the University of Hong Kong, the hospital was also moved to Bonham Road and renamed to Nethersole Hospital.

BWAs are typically issued when monitoring of water being served to consumers detects Escherichia coli or other microbiological indicators of sewage contamination. Another reason for a BWA is a failure of distribution system integrity evidenced by a loss of system pressure. While loss of pressure does not necessarily mean the water has been contaminated, it does mean that pathogens may be able to enter the piped-water system and thus be carried to consumers. In the United States, this has been defined as a drop below . History First Known Boil Water Advisory John Snow's 1849 recommendation that water be \\"filtered and boiled before it is used\\" is one of the first practical applications of the germ theory of disease in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern boil water advisory. Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings. He first published his theory in an 1849 essay On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines. Snow later went so far as to accurately propose in his 1855 edition of the work that the structure of cholera was that of a cell. Snow's ideas were not fully accepted until years after his death. He died in 1858. The first known modern Boil Water Advisory notice based solely on germ theory and unfettered by extraneous and irrelevant advice was distributed in 1866 during the last of three major cholera outbreaks that ravaged London in the 19th century.

Initially produced in a single 4-speed variant paired with the Mitsubishi 3.0 (6G72) engine in vehicles with transverse engines, application was expanded to the Chrysler 3.3 & 3.8 V6 engines in 1990 model year Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager, Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Dynasty & Chrysler New Yorker. A 6-speed variant (62TE) was introduced in the 2007 model year and remains in production for several models as of 2019. The Ultradrive and succeeding transmissions are produced at the Kokomo Transmission plant in Kokomo, Indiana, which also manufactures other Chrysler automatic transmissions. As of 2020, Dodge Journeys equipped with 4-cylinder engines are the only applications of the 4-speed Ultradrive (40TES) remaining in production. The Ram Promaster will be the only car to use an Ultradrive transmission after 2020. History The Ultradrive was a significant technological advancement in transmission operation, one of the first electronically controlled automatics. It pioneered many now-common features such as adaptive shifting, wherein the Electronic control unit optimizes shifting based on the driving style of the operator. It earned a reputation for being unreliable. While the Ultradrive transmission had numerous issues, reportedly due to being rushed into production, a common problem was not necessarily caused by a design flaw, but by poor labelling: both owner's manuals and transmission fluid dipsticks advocated the use of Dexron transmission fluid in the event the required fluid was not available. The transmissions were designed to use a special fluid (Type 7176, also known as ATF+3, now superseded by ATF+4) and many owners reported failures from the use of Dexron, as well as temporary issues which were resolved when the proper fluid was added. There may also have been mistaken impressions of failure due to the \\"limp home\\" feature. When the computer sensed a problem, such as a sensor giving an inappropriate reading, a code would be stored in the car's computer and the transmission would default to second gear only, under transmission computer control, so that owners could still drive to a service location for diagnosis and/or repairs. This may have caused perceptions of failure and premature replacement. A major drawback to the \\"second gear only limp mode\\" was, if second gear was the defective gear, the vehicle would not go forward. The torque converter measured in diameter and was mounted to the flywheel by a flexible drive plate. The transaxle was cooled through an oil- to-water heat exchanger in the collector tank on the radiator, and/or a standard oil-to-air heat exchanger. There were no bands or mechanical holding devices; ratios were supplied by five different clutch packs. This allowed the transmission to be lightweight and to use fewer moving parts than the three speed it replaced. The 41TE transmission which directly replaced the TorqueFlite had a similar design and could be considered an evolutionary change, but it included different valve bodies, solenoid packs, sensors, and other components to increase reliability. This line was also given a flash- programmable TCM and, in 2006, a variable line pressure hydraulic system was phased in, which boosted performance and longevity. \\"Autostick\\" option In some applications, the driver could select a certain gear with an extra position on the stick. Marketed as \\"Autostick,\\" activation required the driver to press a safety button on the selector stick, whereby and the selector could be moved to the \\"manual\\" position -- where side-to-side movements towards the + and - icons (or pressing the + and - buttons on column-mounted selectors) made it possible to manually engage the transmission sequentially through all 4 forward speeds. The computer could override the gear selector to limit maximum engine RPM or prevent selection of a gear too low for vehicle speed. The option was advantageous in certain driving conditions, e.g., slippery roads or mountain driving. Technical information There are currently 4 different types of units. Chrysler switched to a new coded naming convention in the 1990s. This new standard starts with two numbers, the number of gears (4-6) and the torque rating (0-9) plus two or three letters describing the unit. TE:Transverse Electronic LE:Longitudinal Electronic TEA:Transverse Electronic All-Wheel-Drive Differences in bell housing and bolt pattern can be seen between years and platforms (e.g. 2013 Grand Caravan RT platform 62TE is not bolt compatible with a 2013 ProMaster VF platform 62TE).

It debuted in 1993 on the LH cars. It is strengthened with a reworked final drive unit, barreled axle shafts, and upgraded clutch packs. The major modification to a N-S drivetrain while maintaining front wheel drive was accomplished by adding a differential to the transmission case, which was driven by means of a transfer chain from the output shaft of the low/reverse clutch assembly at the rear of the transmission case.

It is a 42LE transaxle, modified for use in rear-wheel drive vehicles by removing the integral differential and transfer chain. Power flow exits the rear of the transmission. The case has also been modified. By design, it has full- electronic shift control with adaptive memory to learn the operator's driving habits controlled by the vehicle's Transmission Control Module (TCM). Contained within the automatic's torque converter is an Electronically Modulated Converter Clutch (EMCC), designed act as a shock absorber for harsh shifting. 42RLE production ceased in early 2012.

The 40TES is used with the 2.4 L GEMA I4 engine while the 41TES is used with the 2.7 L EER V6. The difference between the TES and TE is the TES has a shallower bell housing and the torque converter is more compact. This was done for the revised packaging of the 2007 Sebring's engine compartment. The 40TES and 41TES are also known As VLP, (Variable Line Pressure) Transmissions: a pressure sensor and line pressure solenoid were added to the valve body, in addition to the solenoid pack that bolts to the outside of the case. This resulted in an additional harness connector coming through the case near the manual linkage. Applications: *2007–2010 Chrysler Sebring *2011–2014 Chrysler 200 *2008–2014 Dodge Avenger *2009–2020 Dodge Journey 62TE The 62TE is a six-speed derivative of the 41TE, first introduced on 2007 Chrysler Sebring models fitted with the 3.5L EGJ V6. Applications also include the Pacifica crossover (4.0L), the RT Platform minivans (3.8L & 4.0L V6; also 2.8L diesel for Europe) and the Dodge Journey (3.5L & 3.6L).

Chrysler transmissions need to use their own fluid, designated as ATF+4 Synthetic type 9602 fluid from Chrysler, not any other or any other plus an additive. If any quantity of other type of fluid is added to the transmission, a complete drain, flush and replacement with the correct ATF+4 will be needed. When properly serviced (periodic fluid and filter changes with the required ATF+4 fluid), the transmission performs correctly. The most common problems (shift stuck-, limp mode-, blocking problems) with the Chrysler Ultradrive transmissions are poor shifting quality and sudden locks into second gear (\\"limp-home\\" mode) caused by the transmission computer detecting problems with sensor data. Nine design changes were made in an attempt to fix clutch failure, and four were directed to excessive shifting on hills.http://www.autosafety.org/chrysler-ultradrive 1989-1991 models only After pressure from the US Center for Auto Safety, Consumer Reports, and others, Chrysler LLC promised to waive the $100 deductible in the warranty, provide loaners, and buy back any cars with Ultradrives that could not be fixed (US located cars only). Chrysler ran an unprecedented campaign to contact all American owners of cars with Ultradrives to find and fix problems.

She is best known for playing SPECTRE assassin Fiona Volpe in the fourth James Bond film, Thunderball. Career =Film= Paluzzi was born in Rome, Kingdom of Italy, and was brought up there. She went to Milan and studied naval engineering for two years at the Scientific Academy of Milan, being the only woman in her class. One of her first roles was an uncredited walk-on part in Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), which she got by chance through a friend of her father's who was invited for dinner and happened to be looking for a young actress doing a very short two-line role for director Jean Negulesco, thinking Paluzzi might be a fit. Negulesco had not been satisfied with the other actresses so far, but when Paluzzi, who did not plan to become an actress, recited the English line the next day – it was the only English she spoke at that time – she got the role. Paluzzi went on to appear in many movies, most of which were made in her native Italy. In her early films, she is credited as Luciana Paoluzzi. In 1957, she came to England to appear in the British war film No Time To Die (also known as Tank Force) alongside Victor Mature. She was then cast in the British action drama Sea Fury as the Spanish- born Josita, who is fought over by Stanley Baker's and Victor McLaglen's characters. In 1959, Paluzzi went to Hollywood under contract with Twentieth Century Fox Television to star as a regular in the TV series Five Fingers, which however got cancelled after three months. Paluzzi then played Rafaella, the wife of Brett Halsey's character Ted Carter, in 1961's Return to Peyton Place. From 1963 to 1965, Paluzzi almost exclusively appeared in Italian productions. In 1965, Paluzzi was cast as SPECTRE villainess, Fiona Volpe, in Thunderball (1965), for which she is best known. She had auditioned for the part of the lead Bond girl, Dominetta \\"Domino\\" Petacchi, but producers instead cast Claudine Auger, changing the character's name from an Italian to a Frenchwoman, renaming her Dominique Derval. Initially crestfallen when informed she did not get the part, Paluzzi rejoiced when told her consolatory prize was the part of Volpe, which she said was \\"more fun\\" to play. Paluzzi later claimed being a Bond girl was a double-edged sword. In the documentary Bond Girls Are Forever, Paluzzi expressed amazement at the level of fame, publicity, and recognition she received from Thunderball; but as a result of being in such an outlandish film, she felt she was taken less seriously as an actress when returning to the Italian film industry. Paluzzi appeared in such films as Muscle Beach Party (1964) and Chuka (1967). She co-starred in the 1969 women in prison film 99 Women,Toledo Blade, 6 June 1969 and as a Southern belle in the 1974 Hollywood drama The Klansman (with her voice dubbed by American actress Joanna Moore). =Television= In 1959–60, Paluzzi appeared with David Hedison in the short-lived espionage television series, Five Fingers. She appeared with Tab Hunter in an episode of The Tab Hunter Show in 1960. In 1962 she played a murderous wife in an episode of Thriller titled \\"Flowers of Evil\\". In 1964 she played the villainess in an episode of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., as the seductive THRUSH agent Angela in the first-season episode \\"The Four Steps Affair\\" and in the movie version of the show's pilot episode, To Trap a Spy. In 1966 she played Baroness Carla Montaglia in Season 3, Episode 3 \\"Face of a Shadow\\" in Twelve O'Clock High. Also in 1966, she played Greek bar owner Tuesday Hajadakis in the premier episode of The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. . In 1967 she played the seductive foreign agent Marla Valemska in \\"Matchless,\\" the premier episode of Mr. Teriffic. In 1971 Paluzzi appeared as a special guest star in \\"Powderkeg,\\" the pilot movie for the CBS TV series, Bearcats!. In 1978 she portrayed journalist Liana Labella in the Hawaii Five-O episode \\"My Friend, the Enemy\\". Personal life In 1960, Paluzzi married actor Brett Halsey, who had just left his marriage with Renate Hoy, an actress and Miss Germany of 1954. The two co-starred as a newlywed couple in the film, Return to Peyton Place. The couple had one son, Christian, and after they divorced in 1962 Halsey married Heidi Brühl. During the 1960s and 1970s, Paluzzi had a long-term relationship with Tony Anthony, with whom she appeared in the films Wounds of Hunger and Come Together. Her work in Japan on The Green Slime inspired Anthony to write and produce the hybrid Spaghetti Western-jidaigeki film The Silent Stranger. In 1979, Paluzzi married her current husband, American media mogul Michael Jay Solomon, who had founded Michael Jay Solomon Film International in 1977, co-founded Telepictures Corporation in 1978 and in 1985 became president of Warner Bros. International Television, and she moved to New York to live with her husband. The marriage caused her to leave her film career behind. In 1980, she became sales representative of Canale 5 and :it:Reteitalia in the United States, which she characterized as a very quiet job, and followed her husband on his international travels. Paluzzi and her husband also resided at an exclusive clifftop estate overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Jalisco, Mexico, known as \\"Casa Dos Estrellas\\".Casa Dos Estrellas – Costa Careyes Luxury Mansion (per 3 November 2013) The couple sold that estate in about 2005 to live in New York and Rome, to be close to family.

Eventually a steam-powered mill replaced the older technology. The state bought the area in 1937 and rebuilt the steam engine in 1958. Every year as part of the park's special events and interpretive programs, the old mill is run as it had been years ago. Wildlife Many species are attracted to the river that runs through the park. Deer and moose are the largest animals that frequent the park. Beaver, raccoon, white-tailed jackrabbits and snowshoe hares are common. A bird migration route runs through the park adding more wildlife especially in the spring and fall. The ground-nesting marsh hawk is a common summer resident.

It is largely used as a kitchen or butcher knife intended for hacking through bone. The knife's broad side can also be used for crushing in food preparation (such as garlic). Tools described as cleavers have been in use since the Acheulean period.  Design  In contrast to other kitchen knives, the cleaver has an especially tough edge meant to withstand repeated blows directly into thick meat, dense cartilage, bone, and the cutting board below. This resilience is accomplished by using a softer, tougher steel and a thicker blade, because a harder steel or thinner blade might fracture or buckle under hard use. In use, it is swung like a meat tenderizer or hammer the knife's design relies on sheer momentum to cut efficiently; to chop straight through rather than slicing in a sawing motion. Part of the momentum derives from how hard the user swings the cleaver, and the other part from how heavy the cleaver is. Because of this, the edge of a meat cleaver does not need to be particularly sharp in fact, a knife-sharp edge on a cleaver is undesirable. The grind for a meat cleaver, at approximately 25°, is much blunter than for other kitchen knivesEastern Asian kitchen knives have a grind of 15–18 degrees, while most Western kitchen knives have 20–22° The tough metal and thick blade of a cleaver also make it a suitable tool for crushing with the side of the blade, whereas some hard, thin slicing knives could crack under such repeated stress.  Use  Cleavers are primarily used for cutting through thin or soft bones and sinew. With a chicken, for example, it can be used to chop through the bird's thin bones or to separate ribs. Cleavers can also be used in preparation of hard vegetables and other foods, such as squash, where a thin slicing blade runs the risk of shattering. Cleavers are not used for cutting through solid, thick and hard bones – instead a bone saw, either manual or powered, is used. = Cultural references = Cleavers occur with some frequency in traditional Chinese thought. An old Daoist story on the proper use of a cleaver tells of a butcher who effortlessly cut ox carcasses apart, without ever needing to sharpen his cleaver. When asked how he did so, he replied that he did not cut through the bones, but rather in the space between the bones.The complete idiot's guide to Zen living, by Gary R. McClain, Eve Adamson, p. 227 In explaining his ideal of junzi, Kǒng Fūzǐ remarked \\"Why use an ox-cleaver to carve a chicken?\\" on the futility of the common people seeking to emulate noblemen.  East Asia  = Chinese \\"cleaver\\" = The Chinese chef's knife is frequently incorrectly referred to as a \\"cleaver\\", due its similar rectangular shape. However Chinese chef knives are much thinner in cross-section and are intended more as general-purpose kitchen knives, and mostly used to slice boneless meats, chop, slice, dice, or mince vegetables, and to flatten garlic bulbs or ginger; while also serving as a spatula to carry prepared ingredients to the wok. For butchering tasks and to prepare boned meats, there is a heavier Chinese \\"cleaver\\", used in similar fashion to the Western one. = Japan = Deba bocho of different sizes In Japanese cutlery, the main cleaver used is the light-duty deba bocho, primarily for cutting the head off fish (fish is the main meat in traditional Japanese cuisine).

Numerous introduced populations exist outside its natural range. It is also commercially known as mango fish, nilotica, or boulti. The first name leads to easy confusion with another tilapia traded commercially, the mango tilapia (Sarotherodon galilaeus). Description The Nile tilapia reaches up to in length, and can exceed . As typical of tilapia, males reach a larger size and grow faster than females. Wild, natural-type Nile tilapias are brownish or grayish overall, often with indistinct banding on their body, and the tail is vertically striped. When breeding, males become reddish, especially on their fins. Although commonly confused with the blue tilapia (O. aureus), that species lacks the striped tail pattern, has a red edge to the dorsal fin (this edge is gray or black in Nile tilapia), and males are bluish overall when breeding. The two species can also be separated by meristics. Because many tilapia in aquaculture and introduced around the world are selectively bred variants and/or hybrids, identifying them using the standard features that can be used in the wild, natural types often is not possible. The virtually unknown O. ismailiaensis has a plain tail, but otherwise closely resembles (and may only be a variant of) the Nile tilapia. Regardless, O. ismailiaensis might be extinct, as its only known habitat in northeastern Egypt has disappeared, although similar-looking individuals (perhaps the same) are known from the vicinity. Nile tilapia can live for more than 10 years. Range and habitat The Nile tilapia is native to larger parts of Africa, except Maghreb and almost all of Southern Africa. It is native to tropical West Africa, the Lake Chad basin, and much of the Nile system, including lakes Tana, Albert and Edward–George, as well as lakes Kivu, Tanganyika, and Turkana, and the Awash and Omo Rivers. In Israel, it is native to coastal river basins. It has been widely introduced elsewhere, both in Africa and other continents, including tens of countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. In these places, it often becomes highly invasive, threatening the native ecosystems and species. However, some introduced populations historically labelled as Nile tilapia either are hybrids or another species; the Nile tilapia and blue tilapia especially often have been confused. The Nile tilapia can be found in most types of freshwater habitats, such as rivers, streams, canals, lakes, and ponds, and ranging from sea level to an altitude of . It also occurs in brackish water, but is unable to survive long-term in full salt water. The species has been recorded at water temperatures between , although typically above , and the upper lethal limit usually is at . Also, some variations occur depending on the population. For example, those in the northern part of its range survive down to the coldest temperatures, while isolated populations in hot springs in the Awash basin and at Suguta River generally live in waters that are at least . Although Nile tilapia can survive down to relatively cold temperatures, breeding generally only occurs when the water reaches . =Subspecies= O. n. niloticus Although FishBase considers the species as monotypic, several distinctive populations often are recognized as valid subspecies: * O. n. niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) – most of species' range * O. n. baringoensis Trewavas, 1983 – Lake Baringo in Kenya * O. n. cancellatus (Nichols, 1923) – Awash basin in Ethiopia * O. n. eduardianus (Boulenger, 1912) – Albertine Rift Valley lakes * O. n. filoa Trewavas, 1983 – hot springs in Awash basin in Ethiopia * O. n. sugutae Trewavas, 1983 – Karpeddo soda springs at Suguta River in Kenya * O. n. tana Seyoum & Kornfield, 1992 – Lake Tana in Ethiopia * O. n. vulcani Trewavas, 1933 – Lake Turkana in Ethiopia and Kenya While the species is overall very widespread and common, the IUCN considers O. n. baringoensis as endangered, O. n. sugutae as vulnerable, and O. n. filoa as data deficient. A population found in Lake Bogoria appears to be an undescribed subspecies. The forms referred to as Oreochromis (or Tilapia) nyabikere and kabagole seem to belong to this species, too. An undescribed population found at, for example, Wami River, Lake Manyara, and Tingaylanda seems to be a close relative. Behavior =Feeding= The Nile tilapia is mostly a herbivore, but with omnivorous tendencies, especially when young. They mostly feed on phytoplankton and algae, and in some populations other macrophytes also are important. Other recorded food items are detritus and aquatic insect larvae, including those of mosquitoes, making it a possible tool in the fight against malaria in Africa.\\"Nile tilapia can fight malaria mosquitoes\\", BBC News, 8 August 2007. However, when introduced outside its native range, it often becomes invasive, threatening more localized species. The Nile tilapia typically feeds during daytime, which suggests that, similar to trout and salmon, it exhibits a behavioral response to light as a main factor contributing to feeding activity. Due to its fast reproductive rate, however, overpopulation often results within groups of Nile tilapia. To obtain the necessary nutrients, night feeding may also occur due to competition for food during daylight. A recent study found evidence that, contrary to popular belief, size dimorphism between the sexes results from differential food conversion efficiency rather than different amounts of food consumed. Hence, although males and females eat equal amounts of food, males tend to grow larger due to a higher efficiency of converting food to body weight. =Social organization= Groups of Nile tilapia establish social hierarchies in which the dominant males have priority for both food and mating. Circular nests are built predominantly by males through mouth digging to become future spawning sites. These nests often become sites of intense courtship rituals and parental care. Like other fish, Nile tilapia travel almost exclusively in schools. Although males settle down in their crafted nesting zones, females travel between zones to find mates, resulting in competition between the males for females. Like other tilapias, such as Mozambique tilapia, dominance between the males is established first through noncontact displays such as lateral display and tail beats. Unsuccessful attempts to reconcile the hierarchy results in contact fighting to inflict injuries. Nile tilapia have been observed to modify their fighting behavior based upon experiences during development. Thus, experience in a certain form of agonistic behavior results in differential aggressiveness among individuals. Once the social hierarchy is established within a group, the dominant males enjoy the benefits of both increased access to food and an increased number of mates. However, social interactions between males in the presence of females results in higher energy expenditures as a consequence of courtship displays and sexual competition. =Reproduction= Typical of most fish, Nile tilapia reproduce through mass spawning of a brood within a nest made by the male. In such an arrangement, territoriality and sexual competition amongst the males lead to large variations in reproductive success for individuals in a group. The genetic consequence of such behavior is reduced genetic variability in the long run, as inbreeding is likely to occur among different generations due to differential male reproductive success. Perhaps driven by reproductive competition, tilapias reproduce within a few months after birth. The relatively young age of sexual maturation within Nile tilapia leads to high birth and turnover rates. Consequently, the rapid reproductive rate of individuals can actually have a negative impact on growth rate, leading to the appearance of stunted tilapia as a result of a reduction in somatic growth in favor of sexual maturation. Female Nile tilapia, in the presence of other females either visually or chemically, exhibit shortened interspawning intervals. Although parental investment by a female extends the interspawning period, female tilapia that abandon their young to the care of a male gain this advantage of increased interspawning periods. One of the possible purposes behind this mechanism is to increase the reproductive advantage of females that do not have to care for young, allowing them more opportunities to spawn. For males, reproductive advantage goes to the more dominant males. Males have differential levels of gonadotropic hormones responsible for spermatogenesis, with dominant males having higher levels of the hormone. Thus, selection has favored larger sperm production with more successful males. Similarly, dominant males have both the best territory in terms of resources and the greatest access to mates. Furthermore, visual communication between Nile tilapia mates both stimulates and modulates reproductive behavior between partners such as courtship, spawning frequency, and nest building. =Parental care= Species belonging to the genus Oreochromis typically care for their young through mouthbrooding, oral incubation of the eggs and larvae. Similar to other tilapia, Nile tilapia are maternal mouthbrooders and extensive care is, therefore, provided almost exclusively by the female. After spawning in a nest made by a male, the young fry or eggs are carried in the mouth of the mother for a period of 12 days. Sometimes, the mother pushes the young back into her mouth if she believes they are not ready for the outside. Nile tilapias also demonstrate parental care in times of danger. When approached by a danger, the young often swim back into the protection of their mother's mouth. However, mouthbrooding leads to significant metabolic modifications for the parents, usually the mother, as reflected by fluctuations in body weight and low fitness. Thus, parental-offspring conflict can be observed through the costs and benefits of mouthbrooding. Protection of the young ensures passage of an individual's genes into the future generations, but caring for the young also reduces an individual's own reproductive fitness. Since female Nile tilapia exhibiting parental care show extended interspawning periods, one of the benefits is slowing down vitellogenesis (yolk deposition) to increase the survival rate of one's own young. The size of spawned eggs correlates directly with advantages concerning hatching time, growth, survival, and onset of feeding, since increased egg size means increased nutrients for the developing young. Thus, one of the reasons behind a delayed interspawning period by female Nile tilapia may be for the benefit of offspring survival. Aquaculture Egyptian New Kingdom amulet in the shape of a tilapia hieroglyph from circa 1350/1320 BC Tilapia, likely the Nile tilapia, was well known as food fish in Ancient Egypt and commonly featured in their art (paintings and sculptures). This includes a 4000-year-old tomb illustration that shows them in man-made ponds, likely an early form of aquaculture. In modern aquaculture, wild-type Nile tilapia are not farmed very often because the dark color of their flesh is undesirable for many customers, and because of the reputation the fish has as being a trash fish. However, they are fast-growing and produce good fillets; leucistic (\\"red\\") breeds which have lighter meat have been developed to counter the consumer distaste for darker meat. Hybrid stock is also used in aquaculture; Nile × blue tilapia hybrids are usually rather dark, but a light-colored hybrid breed known as \\"Rocky Mountain White\\" tilapia is often grown due to its very light flesh and tolerance of low temperatures. As food Live pla nin on a table at a Thai market The red-hybrid Nile tilapia is known in the Thai language as pla thapthim (), meaning \\"pomegranate fish\\" or \\"ruby fish\\".Management Guidelines of Red Tilapia Culture in Cages, Trang Province This type of tilapia is very popular in Thai cuisine, where it is prepared in a variety of ways. The black-and-white-striped tilapia pla nin (), meaning \\"Nile fish\\", has darker flesh and is commonly either salted and grilled or deep-fried, and it can also be steamed with lime (pla nin nueng manao).Fish breeding in Thailand Nile tilapia, called bulṭī in Arabic, is (being native to Egypt) among the most common fish in Egyptian cuisine, and probably the most common in regions far from the coast. It is generally either battered and pan- fried whole ( bulṭī maqlī [bʊltˤiː maʔliː]) or grilled whole ( bulṭī mashwī [bʊltˤiː maʃwiː]). Like other fish in Egypt, is generally served with rice cooked with onions and other seasonings to turn it red. In Israel, Nile tilapia is commonly fried , grilled or baked with vegetables herbs and spices and eaten with rice or bulgur pilafs. It is also baked in the oven with tahini sauce drizzled over it with potatoes, onions, asparagus, sweet peppers or tomatoes and flavored with sumac and dried mint. Tilapia, often farmed, is a popular and common supermarket fish in the United States. In India, Nile tilapia is the most dominant fish in some of the South Indian reservoirs and available throughout the year. O. niloticus grows faster and reaches bigger sizes in a given time. The littoral areas of Kelavarappalli Reservoir are full of nests of Nile tilapia and they breed during south-west monsoon (July–September). The fish mainly feed on detritus. Zooplankton, phytoplankton, and macrophytes also were recorded occasionally from the gut of Nile tilapia. The demand is heavy, especially from local poor people, as this fish is affordable to the lowest income group in this area.

Gandy charged that Matthews \\"is a repeat offender when it comes to sexist attitudes toward women politicians. . . . I wasn't really looking for an apology.

The 2006 Winter Olympics were her sixth. Despite her age, she is a strong competitor with numerous international podium finishes, and she is consistently ranked in the top 20 world rankings. She is known within luge circles as \\"Grandma Luge.\\" She is training for the 2020 Summer Olympics as an archer.  Career  Her top finishes include third place at the Nations Cup in Igls, Austria in January 2004, and third place at the Nations Cup in Königssee, Germany, February 2004. She finished in the top 10 in seven of the eight events in the 2004-2005 Nations Cup series. Abernathy finished 25th in the 37th World Championships in 2004 in Nagano, Japan, but did not compete in the 2005 championships in Park City, Utah due to injuries suffered during homologation at the Cesana Pariol track in Cesana, Italy three weeks earlier. Abernathy suffered a serious accident during a World Cup race in Altenberg, Germany in January 2001 that resulted in a severe brain injury. To recover from the injury, she used an alternative medicine treatment involving controlling rockets in a video game through electrical impulses from brain waves, a therapy designed to help her retrain her brain to compensate for the damaged areas. The therapy was successful and Abernathy was able to return to competition in time to qualify for the 2002 Winter Olympics. The story of Abernathy's crash and recovery was featured on the Discovery Health Channel series Impact: Stories of Survival. During practice for the competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics, Abernathy crashed and broke her wrist and her scapula, and was forced to withdraw from competition. Abernathy is the oldest woman to ever compete in the Winter Olympic Games, breaking the old record during the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. She is the only woman to qualify for six Winter Olympic Games and one of only two female athletes to compete in five Winter Olympics. In 2006, she became the first woman over 50 to qualify for the Winter Olympics. Abernathy was the first woman to qualify for six Winter Olympics. In the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City she became the oldest woman to ever compete in the Winter Games. She is the oldest female Olympian in any Olympic Games (Winter or Summer) and the first woman over the age of 50 in the Winter Olympics. During the Albertville Winter Olympics, she became the first athlete to compete with a camera on board, a feat that was nominated for an Emmy in technical broadcast achievement. In the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, Abernathy became the first athlete to create an on-line diary (now known as a blog) which was an exclusive on AOL. Before her first Olympic appearance in 1988, Abernathy was diagnosed and treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (cancer). Although the cancer returned several times during her sports career, the fact was kept hidden from the public through three Olympic appearances until it was revealed in a front-page article of The Washington Post' prior to the 1998 Nagano Olympics.

The game was developed by Stormfront Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios. Set in an Asian-themed fictional world, Blood Wake is a story-driven, mission- based high seas action game in which the player controls a series of small fighting vessels. First unveiled at E3 2001, the game received mixed reviews from critics according to the aggregate website Metacritic. Some reviewers described its gameplay as \\"Twisted Metal on water,\\" although its mission-based story line differentiated Blood Wake from Twisted Metal's arena-based gameplay. The game sold enough copies to be added to Microsoft's budget line, known as Platinum Hits. Gameplay Blood Wake is a water combat game featuring various types of boats and ordinance. The game features a wide variety of naval vessels, from tiny sampans to powerful speedboats and torpedo boats, on up to destroyers and a massive battleship. Over a dozen of these are playable and most have multiple weapon configurations. The weapon types include the standard chain guns, cannon, torpedoes, rockets and mines, plus some unique weapons that are unlocked as you progress through the game. Each boat has machine guns or chain guns as its base, primary armament. Most have one or more heavy weapons as their secondary armament. The single player story-mode consists of 28 missions featuring a wide variety of attack, defense, escort and raid mission types. These missions take the player to many exotic locales and though the player never leaves the water, the game engine allows the designers to vary the sea and sky conditions to create very different gameplay environments. There is also a multiplayer mode that supports a variety of game types for up to four players. The multiplayer options are somewhat limited at first, but progress through the story mode unlocks many new options. The game also features numerous Easter Eggs such as special boats and hidden game modes, including the development team's favorite, \\"Blood Ball\\", which is essentially multiplayer soccer-on-water using a 10-meter diameter soccer ball and heavily armed gunboats. There are many different vehicles at the player's disposal in Blood Wake. In the Story Mode the player is assigned a particular boat for each mission. The first is the Speedboat, and each of the mission of the first act features a different variant. As the story progresses, the player is introduced to ever more powerful boats, including a few captured enemy vessels. All of these plus several more are playable in the multiplayer Battle Mode. The following are the main types used by the player during the Story Mode missions: *Speedboat: small, fast boat with light weaponry. This is the boat given to the player in the first chapter of Story Mode. Its armament usually consists of four chain guns or auto-cannons, but later adds a rocket launcher. However, the boat is completely stripped of all armaments for one special mission involving a time trial-style race. In one special mission later in the game it is armed with the Stinger, an extremely powerful, but short-ranged electrical weapon. *Catamaran: the game's signature boat, this is featured on the game's cover. Standard armament for this vessel includes two chain guns or auto cannons, with a center mount that may have a rocket launcher, the Stinger, or the Wave Gun (another special weapon type that generates a wave that can detonate torpedoes and sea mines as well as jolt smaller vessels. In addition, it has a pair of side mounts that may hold torpedo launchers or fixed cannons. These weapons differ in combination depending on the model of Catamaran. *Gunboat: modeled on a cigarette boat, it is one of the fastest in the game. Its armament is virtually the same as the catamaran, but it adds a rear mount for a mine launcher. *Devil Boat: at 75 feet long, this is the largest and most heavily armed playable boat in the game. Inspired by the PT boats of World War II, it has four forward mounts for its primary armament of auto cannons or chain guns. Its secondary armament features dual center mounted rocket launchers, a rear-mounted mine launcher, and four side mounts. The side mounts may have two fixed cannons on the forward pair plus two torpedo launchers on the rear pair, or four torpedo launchers. *Hydroplane: The ultra-speedy hydroplane is the fastest and most maneuverable vessel in the game. Modeled on the racing boat Miss Budweiser, its armament is the same as the Gunboat. Plot The player controls Lieutenant Shao Kai, a former naval officer of the Northern League fleet who was betrayed and left for dead by his brother, Admiral Shao Lung. Kai is rescued by a band of sea raiders known as the Shadow Clan, and joins them after proving himself worthy to their leader, Ped Zeng. He will bide his time with them awaiting his chance for revenge against his brother. Here he meets a formidable young woman who advises Ped and becomes the love interest. The Shadow Clan spends most of its time preying on the third faction in the game, the Jade Kingdom, who are primarily a mercantile power led by Lord Sri Brana. All are now in the path of Admiral Shao Lung's ambitions to create the Iron Empire. Lung has developed a monstrous warship named the Dragon and a powerful magic amulet to defeat anyone and anything in his way. Development Initial development began following the creation of the basic game engine by lead programmer Ralf Knoesel during his holiday break following the completion of Stormfront's previous release, a Hot Wheels racing game. Together with lead artists Tim Dean and Matt Small, they conceived a concept that was essentially \\"Twisted Metal on water.\\" The team received permission to develop a prototype and Stormfront started looking for a publisher. Enter Microsoft who was looking for a suitable development partner for an original IP they had developed that was likened to \\"Crimson Skies on water.\\" While Stormfront's engine had been designed to support arena combat, they were confident it could be adapted to support the story-driven mission- based structure needed by Microsoft. Music was composed by Robb Mills. The development team grew under the direction of David Bunnett who hired a contract writer named David Ackerman-Gray to develop the story, and David Wessman to be the lead designer. Wessman had formerly been the gameplay and story lead for the highly acclaimed X-Wing series, and was eagerly welcomed to the team for his expertise in vehicular combat games. In addition, he brought a passion for research into the topic of small boat warfare and drew inspiration for the story and missions from histories of the American Civil War, the Opium Wars, World War II and the Vietnam War. As the game took shape, the team was able to consistently deliver on its milestones up to a week early, thus earning considerable respect from Microsoft. When the game entered QA at Microsoft it was observed that testers who were not assigned to work on it nevertheless would spend their free time playing it. This was noted as an extremely good sign, and Microsoft began to think they might have a sleeper hit on their hands. Stormfront was granted a small extension to their schedule for additional polish. Reception The game received average reviews from critics according to Metacritic. In March 2017 GamesRadar+ staff named Blood Wake one of the original Xbox franchise they would like to see revived. The game was not literally an Xbox launch title, since its debut was part of a second wave of game releases thirty days after the first launch. It was highly anticipated following the excited press reaction at the 2000 E3. Microsoft backed Blood Wake with a television advertising campaign on release, and it reached sixth on the NPD sales charts in November 2002 with over 340,000 units sold, and later that year was the #1 game on the NPD Xbox game rental rankings. With strong sales the game became one of the first in Microsoft's Platinum Series Hits and was re-released with new box cover art and a lower price.

However, prior to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in England the start of the new year was 25 March; the battle being fought on 20 March meant it fell into the previous year, that is in 1469. between the troops of Thomas Talbot, 2nd Viscount Lisle and William Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley. It is notable for being the last battle fought in England entirely between the private armies of feudal magnates. Prelude Lisle and Berkeley had long been engaged in a dispute over the inheritance of Berkeley Castle and the other Berkeley lands,Christine Carpenter, The Wars of the Roses:Politics and the Constitution in England, c.1437-1509, (Cambridge University Press, 1997), 175. Lisle being heir-general to Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley and Berkeley heir-male. Lisle impetuously challenged Berkeley to a battle, and the latter agreed, the battle to be fought the next day at Nibley Green. In the little time available, Lisle could only raise a force among his ill- equipped local tenants. Berkeley, however, could draw upon a garrison from Berkeley Castle as well as his local levies, and he was reinforced by men led by his brother Maurice Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley and miners from the Forest of Dean. This gave him a considerable advantage in numbers, about 1,000 to 300. Philip Mede of Wraxall, an alderman and mayor of Bristol in 1459, 1462, and 1469, sent some men on the Berkeley side. Maurice Berkeley, William's younger brother, had married Isabel Mede, Philip's daughter, for which act of marrying beneath his social status he had been disinherited of the Berkeley lands by his elder brother, William.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, Berkeley, Baroness, precedents This was hardly a mark of gratitude for Mede's assistance. Battle Lisle led his men in a charge against Berkeley's troops as they emerged from a stand of woods. Berkeley's archers loosed arrows and broke up the charge. One of the Dean Foresters, an archer named \\"Black Will\\", shot Lisle in the left temple through his open visor and unhorsed him. A few dagger-strokes from the archers ensured Lisle's death,Michael Hicks, English Political Culture in the Fifteenth Century, (Routledge, 2002), 60. and his leaderless army broke and fled. Aftermath As Lisle's army dispersed, Berkeley advanced to Lisle's manor of Wotton-under-Edge and sacked it. Further reading *Fleming, Peter & Wood, Michael.

As a SS member and Sicherheitsdienst employee, he became a \\"multifunctionary\\" in the time of the Third Reich, including posts as leader of both the National Socialist German Students' League and the German Student Union, as an Einsatzgruppen commander in occupied Alsace, as well as Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter in Salzburg from November 1941 until May 1945. As Einsatzgruppen commander, he organized in October 1940 the deportation of Karlsruhe's Jews to the extermination camps in the east. Life Born as a Protestant pastor's son in Rosenberg, North Baden, Scheel attended classical Gymnasium schools in Freiburg, Tauberbischofsheim and Mannheim. While still a schoolboy, he became involved in nationalist circles of the German Youth Movement and Nazi groups after World War I. Beginning in the summer semester of 1928, he studied law, political economy and theology at Heidelberg University to become a minister like his father. Scheel intensified his activities in right-wing student circles and in the winter semester of 1928-29 became a member of the Verein Deutscher Studenten (VDSt), an umbrella organization of German Studentenverbindung fraternities. A year later he was the league's chairman. Nazi career In 1929 he joined the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB), on 1 October 1930 the SA and on 1 December 1930 the Nazi Party (NSDAP). He moved for a short time to Tübingen University to begin studies in medicine. He continued his studies again in Heidelberg, where he quickly rose to become one of the main propagandists of the Nazis at the college. As NSDStB College Group Leader (Hochschulgruppenführer), he led the Nazi student rallies against the mathematics professor and pacifist Emil Julius Gumbel (1891–1966) which led to the removal of Gumbel's teaching entitlement in 1932. In 1933, Scheel became chairman of the Heidelberg General Students' Board (AStA). During this time, he also became Hanns-Martin Schleyer's mentor, getting him to join the NSDAP and the SS. Furthermore, Scheel exerted influence over the university's appointments and personnel policy in his capacity as student leader and member of the vice chancellor's leadership staff. In May 1933, he was one of the main speakers at the Heidelberg book burning. In 1934, Scheel sat his State medical examination, was appointed to the NSDStB leadership, and (in September) became a SS and a full-time Sicherheitsdienst (SD) employee. He rose swiftly in this secret Nazi organization. Between 1935 and 1939 he led the local SD Section Southwest in Stuttgart and, as a former student official, he brought along with him to the SD a great many young Nazi academics who went on to mass murder. Among them were Walter Stahlecker, Martin Sandberger, , , Erich Ehrlinger, and Eugen Steimle, all of whom went into various divisions of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) to become leaders of murder squads of the various Einsatzgruppen. Scheel speaking at the Charles University in Prague, 1939 Scheel, who had in 1933 fought vehemently for the exclusion of \\"students of Jewish lineage\\" from the \\"benefits of social institutions at the university\\" became, during the 1940 Battle of France, commander of the Sicherheitspolizei in Alsace. In October 1940, he organised the deportation of Karlsruhe's Jews to their certain deaths in the east. Scheel's further rise within the Nazi repression apparatus kept on unabated. In April 1941, he rose to the rank of a SS Brigadeführer and a Police Major General. He became SS and police leader Alpenland from 1 May 1941. He was installed as Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) in the Reichsgau of Salzburg on 27 November of the same year, succeeding Friedrich Rainer and uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the region.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, p. 372, . On 16 November 1942, he was named Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. After the discovery of resistance groups in Salzburg, he organized a widespread wave of arrests and had a number of railwaymen put to death. In 1943, he declared in his capacity as a student leader that the members of the White Rose (Weiße Rose) resistance group should be \\"executed not as students\\", but rather as \\"antisocial former Wehrmacht members\\". Scheel's point of view was that these \\"criminals\\" should not be allowed to stain the student body's image. From this time also came Scheel's declaration: :\\"German student, it is not necessary for you to live, but, to be sure, to fulfil your duty to your people.\\" In 1944, Scheel succeeded Walter Schultze as leader of the National Socialist German Lecturers League and was appointed member of the Reichsforschungsrat executive board. On 1 August he was elevated to the rank of SS-Obergruppenführer. As a Nazi \\"multifunctionary\\", Scheel held the following functions (other than those mentioned above): *Leader of the Heidelberg Student Body *Honorary Senator of the University of Heidelberg *Leader of the Berlin SD School *Inspector of the Security Police and the SD in Stuttgart *Leader of the Nazi Old Gentlemen's Federation *Chairman of the Reich Student Works *President of the German Study Works for Foreigners *Member of the Reich Labour Chamber *Commander of the Security Police and the SD under Chief of the civil administration in Alsace *Member of the Reichstag *Leader of the SD Upper Division South (Munich) *Inspector of the Security Police and the SD under the higher SS and Police leaders South and Main *Higher SS and Police leader *Leader of the SS- Oberabschnitt Alpenland (Salzburg) As Nazi Germany's defeat loomed in 1944-45, Scheel was made leader of the Volkssturm in the Gau of Salzburg. On 29 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, in his will, assigned Scheel to the position of Reich Minister for Science, National Education and Culture. After 1945 After Salzburg's bloodless handover to the Americans on 4 May, Scheel initially fled but ten days later placed himself to the disposal of the US forces and was interned. After spending time in many camps and prisons, he was released on 24 December 1947. After once again being interned, he was transferred to Heidelberg to undergo denazification. A local court sentenced him in 1948 to five years in a labour camp, and classified him as a Hauptschuldiger (literally \\"main culprit\\"). He was however released on 24 December 1948 as a result of several testimonies in his defence stating that he had ignored Hitler's commands to defend the City of Salzburg against the approaching US forces. Afterwards, he first worked as a night worker at the Port of Hamburg, and as of summer 1949, he was a doctor in a Hamburg hospital, then an assistant doctor at Rautenberg Hospital in Hamburg. After an appeal proceeding in 1952, Scheel was classified as a Belasteter (\\"incriminated one\\"). From 1951 to 1953, he belonged, along with other former Nazi leaders such as Werner Best and Werner Naumann, to the neo-Nazi \\"Naumann Circle\\" and so was arrested in January 1953 by British police, who suspected him of building up a secret organization; he was later handed over to German authorities. He was released on 17 June 1953. On 3 December 1954, his trial was suspended for lack of any adequate suspicion of wrongdoing. From February 1954 to 8 April 1977, he was the owner of a medical practice in Hamburg.

In her surviving motet book, Motetti a due a tre voci op.2, Assandra alludes to her birthplace being in the Province of Pavia. She became famous as an organist and published various works during her lifetime. Her work Motetti a due, was dedicated to G.B. Biglia, the Bishop of Pavia, and was first recognized by publisher Lomazzo. Although Assandra had accumulated a substantial reputation for her works as a composer, even reaching outside the borders of Italy, she was at times confused with another 18th-century composer with the same name. And although the date of her birth is approximate, the date of her death is still unknown.  Early life  Assandra composed a number of motets and organ pieces, written in German tablature. She studied counterpoint with Benedetto Re, or Reggio, one of the leading teachers at Pavia Cathedral, who dedicated a piece to her in 1607. Re may have been an exiled German Catholic. Assandra's musical talents were noted by the publisher Lomazzo early in her career, in his dedication of the works of Giovanni Paolo Cima. She composed many works during the first half of the 17th century, including Promptuarium Musicum and Siren Colestis. In 1609, Assandra took vows and entered the Benedictine monastery of Saint Agata in Lomello, in the Lombard region of northern Italy. She adopted \\"Agata\\" as her religious name and continued composing, including a collection of motets in the new concertato style in Milan in 1609, an imitative eight-voice Salve Regina in 1611, and a motet, Audite verbum Dominum, for four voices in 1618. After entering the convent, Assandra published no new books of music. Caterina Assandra was the first Italian nun to have an entire collection of musical works published, following Raffaella Aleotti.  Career  Two of her compositions from Op. 2 appeared in German publications during the decade and a half following their original appearance. Two works by her, otherwise unknown, also appear in German tablature in a manuscript located in the Furst Thurn und Taxis library in Regensburg. Assandra's motets were among the first in the Roman style to be published in Milan, as Borsieri noted. Researchers suggest Borsieri must have heard in her music the influence of Agazzari, whose small-scale works had recently been published in the city. She composed both highly traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is Duo seraphim. Her motet O Salutaris hostia, included in Motetti op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include 'violone'.  Personal life  Two influential figures to Caterina's style were her teacher, Re, and local composer Agazzari. Due to her living in the convent and the likeness between the written bass and continuo parts, her motets were able to be performed and function without male singers, though they were often written for two sopranos, alto, bass, and continuo. On February 20 of 1606, publisher Giovanni Paolo Cima dedicated a portion of his Partito de Ficercari & Canzoni Alla Francese to Caterina. This is the composer's first known mention and is as follows: \\"To the very excellent and most virtuous lady and my very obliging and benign Mistress: Caterina Assandra\\".

The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can behave as independent quasiparticles. The theory of spin–charge separation originates with the work of Sin-Itiro Tomonaga who developed an approximate method for treating one-dimensional interacting quantum systems in 1950. This was then developed by Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger in 1963 with an exactly solvable model which demonstrated spin–charge separation. In 1981 F. Duncan M. Haldane generalized Luttinger's model to the Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid concept whereby the physics of Luttinger's model was shown theoretically to be a general feature of all one-dimensional metallic systems. Although Haldane treated spinless fermions, the extension to spin-½ fermions and associated spin–charge separation was clear so that the promised follow-up paper did not appear. Spin–charge separation is one of the most unusual manifestations of the concept of quasiparticles. This property is counterintuitive, because neither the spinon, with zero charge and spin half, nor the chargon, with charge minus one and zero spin, can be constructed as combinations of the electrons, holes, phonons and photons that are the constituents of the system. It is an example of fractionalization, the phenomenon in which the quantum numbers of the quasiparticles are not multiples of those of the elementary particles, but fractions. The same theoretical ideas have been applied in the framework of ultracold atoms. In a two-component Bose gas in 1D, strong interactions can produce a maximal form of spin–charge separation. Observation Building on physicist F. Duncan M. Haldane's 1981 theory, experts from the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham proved experimentally in 2009 that a mass of electrons artificially confined in a small space together will split into spinons and holons due to the intensity of their mutual repulsion (from having the same charge).Discovery About Behavior Of Building Block Of Nature Could Lead To Computer Revolution. Science Daily (July 31, 2009) A team of researchers working at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory observed the peak spectral structures of spin–charge separation three years prior.

Also variously termed a concentration camp, detainment camp, detention camp, prison, and ghetto, Trnopolje held between 4,000 and 7,000 Bosniak and Bosnian Croat inmates at any one time and served as a staging area for mass deportations, mainly of women, children, and elderly men. Between May and November 1992, an estimated 30,000 inmates passed through. Mistreatment was widespread and there were numerous instances of torture, rape, and killing; ninety inmates died. In August, the existence of the Prijedor camps was discovered by the Western media, leading to their closure. Trnopolje was transferred into the hands of the International Red Cross (IRC) in mid-August, and closed in November 1992. After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted several Bosnian Serb officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their roles in the camp, but ruled that the abuses perpetrated in Prijedor did not constitute genocide. Crimes in Trnopolje were also listed in the ICTY's indictment of former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, who died mid-trial in March 2006. Background The administrative district ( or općina) of Prijedor is made up of 71 smaller towns and villages. According to the 1991 Yugoslav census, Prijedor had a total population of 112,470, of which 44 percent identified as Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), 42.5 percent as Serbs, 5.6 percent as Croats, 5.7 percent as Yugoslavs and 2.2 percent as \\"others\\" (Ukrainians, Russians, and Italians). Prijedor was of strategic significance to the Bosnian Serbs as it connected north-western Bosnia with the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in Croatia, a breakaway state that had been established by Croatian Serbs in 1991. It was also in 1991 that the Serbs of Prijedor organized and enforced a Serb-only administration in the town and placed it under the control of the Bosnian Serb capital Banja Luka. Milomir Stakić, a physician who had been the deputy to the elected Bosniak mayor Muhamed Čehajić, was declared the Serb mayor of Prijedor. On 30 April 1992, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of Prijedor. Four-hundred Bosnian Serb police participated in the takeover, whose objective was to usurp the functions of the municipality's president and vice- president, the director of the post office, and the chief of police. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in the suburb of Čirkin Polje, where they were broadly divided into five groups of about 20 members each, and ordered to gain control of five buildings, one assigned to each group: the assembly building, police headquarters, courts, bank, and post office. Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians prepared a declaration of the takeover, which was broadcast repeatedly on Radio Prijedor the following day. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) would conclude that the takeover was an illegal coup d'état, planned and coordinated long in advance with the aim of creating an ethnically pure municipality. The conspirators made no secret of the takeover plan, and it was implemented by the coordinated actions of Serb politicians, police, and army. Dr. Stakić, a leading figure in the coup, was to play a dominant role in the political life of the municipality during the war. Following the seizure of power, Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were removed from positions of responsibility. On 30 May 1992, Prijedor police chief Simo Drljača officially opened four camps (Trnopolje, Omarska, Keraterm and Manjača) where non-Serbs who failed to leave Prijedor were then confined. To avert resistance, Bosnian Serb forces interrogated all non-Serbs that were deemed a threat and arrested every Bosniak and Croat who had authority or power. Non-Serb men of fighting age were particularly targeted for interrogation and separated from women, children and the elderly. Operation Trnopolje was a predominantly Muslim village within the Prijedor municipality prior to the outbreak of the Bosnian War. The camp formed inside it was established on the grounds of a local primary school, which was named after the concept of Brotherhood and Unity (Osnovna škola Bratstvo–Jedinstvo). Trnopolje held both male and female prisoners. Most of the non-Serb women of Prijedor passed through it at some point, and many were raped. A total of 30,000 people were detained in the camp from May to November 1992. It held 4,000–7,000 prisoners at any given time. Trnopolje was described variously as a ghetto, a prison and a detention camp. A United Nations (UN) report from 1994 reported that Trnopolje was a concentration camp which functioned as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women, children, and elderly men. The reported found that: Refugees reported that Trnopolje was a \\"decent\\" camp in comparison to Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings, only arbitrary ones. Indeed, many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily, \\"simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages\\". This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as \\"a perverse haven\\" for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor. Author Hariz Halilovich writes: Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment. By August 1992, Trnopolje held about 3,500 people. On 7 August 1992, reporters from Independent Television News (ITN), a British television station, took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje, and recorded their living conditions. The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage. This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross (IRC) access to some of the Prijedor camps, but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye. Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992. The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August. In mid-August, Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC. The camp was officially shut down that November. Aftermath The camp's main building resumed its function as a local primary school following the Bosnian War. A monument to the Bosnian Serb soldiers killed in the war has also been erected in the school's vicinity. In 1997, the British magazine Living Marxism (LM) claimed that footage filmed at Trnopolje deliberately misrepresented the situation in the camp. This caused ITN to sue LM for libel in 2000. Following ITN's victory in a court case in which the evidence given by the camp doctor led LM to abandon its defence, the magazine declared itself bankrupt, avoiding payment of the large damages awarded. \\"Prijedor 92\\", an association representing the survivors of Prijedor area camps, estimates that 90 inmates perished in the camp during its operation. During Milomir Stakić's trial, ICTY prosecutors claimed that several hundred non-Serbs were killed at Trnopolje between May and November 1992. The ICTY puts the number of inmates killed in all Bosnian Serb-run camps in Prijedor at 1,500. The number of women raped in Trnopolje remains unknown. =Indictments and trials= Milomir Stakić was convicted for his role in setting up the camps at Trnopolje, Keraterm and Omarska in July 2003 and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was acquitted of the charge of genocide. In March 2006, Stakić's sentence was reduced to 40 years on appeal. The court upheld his conviction for extermination and persecution of Prijedor's non-Serb population, but also upheld his acquittal for the charge of genocide. Zoran Žigić, a taxi-driver from Prijedor, was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment in November 2001 for abusing, beating, torturing, raping and killing detainees at Trnopolje, as well as at Keraterm and Omarska. His conviction was upheld in February 2005, and his 25-year sentence was affirmed. Crimes committed in Trnopolje, Keraterm and Omarska were listed in the ICTY's indictment of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević following the war. Milošević died in his cell on 11 March 2006, before his trial could be completed. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) presented its judgment in the Bosnian Genocide Case on 26 February 2007, in which it examined atrocities committed in detention camps, including Trnopolje, in relation to Article II (b) of the Genocide Convention.

The school enrolls 378 boarding and day students as of 2013–14. In 1971, Concord Academy became the first all-girls' boarding school in New England to shift to a coeducational model. Academics Concord Academy ranks in the top fifteen U.S. boarding schools for student SAT scores and SSAT scores.\\"Highest SAT Scores\\", Boarding School Review. Retrieved January 9, 2012. To foster love of learning and a noncompetitive environment, the school does not compute class rank and awards no academic, arts, athletic, or community awards during the school year or at graduation. The school eliminated all AP courses several years ago due to the lack of depth in their curricula. They were replaced by advanced courses designed by teachers, though the school still offers AP exams. Eighty percent of the students taking an AP exam score a 4 or 5. Demographics The demographic breakdown of the 378 students registered for the 2013–14 school year was: *Asian – 23.3% *Black – 2.6% *Hispanic – 5.0% *White – 61.7% *Multiracial – 7.4% Athletics Concord Academy students play on 28 teams in 23 sports; about 75 percent of students play on at least one team each year. Teams compete in the Eastern Independent League (EIL). Student life The dress code at Concord Academy is casual. Boarding students live in three girls' houses and three boys' houses, each holding an average of 25 students. A little more than a third of the day students commute to school on the MBTA Commuter Rail. Day (commuting) students comprise 60% of student population and boarding students 40%. Students participate in a variety of clubs, performing arts groups, and other activities. The campus is a short walk from restaurants and shops in Concord and students have easy access to Cambridge and Boston via the MBTA Commuter Rail. Campus Concord Academy's primary campus is on between Main Street and the Sudbury River in the center of Concord, Massachusetts. The campus includes eleven historic houses on Main Street, all built as family homes between 1780 and 1830. It is a three-minute walk from the center of Concord and a five-minute walk from the MBTA Commuter Rail stop in Concord. Among the campus buildings are the PAC (Performing Arts Center), the SHAC (Student Health and Athletic Center), the main school, the newly built CA Labs, and the MAC (Math and Arts Center). The Elizabeth B. Hall Chapel is a 19th-century meetinghouse that was transported to Concord from Barnstead, New Hampshire in 1956. It serves as a meeting place three times per week for the entire Concord Academy community. The new 13-acre Moriarty Athletic campus, a mile from the main campus, includes six tennis courts, a baseball field, a field hockey field, and two soccer/lacrosse fields. A field house contains changing rooms, a training room, and a common room with fireplace. These new facilities freed up space on the main campus for expansion of academic and arts facilities. History Concord Academy was established as a school for girls in September 1922. Enrollment grew gradually from three in 1924 to 20 in 1948. The school's headmistress for the first 15 years was Elsie Garland Hobson, followed by Valerie Knapp (1937–40) and Josephine Tucker (1940–49). Tucker imposed the advisor system and ended the giving of prizes at commencement. Under Elizabeth Hall (1949–63), student population increased. * 1981 – Thomas E.

His disciples taught and encouraged a new fervent brand of Judaism, related to Kabbalah, known as Hasidism. The rise of Hasidism had a great influence on the rise of Haredi Judaism, with a continuous influence through its many Hasidic dynasties. A radically different movement was started by Jacob Frank in the middle of the 18th century.

However, most of them were hostile to traditional Jewish culture and Jewish political parties, and were loyal to the Communist Party's atheism and proletarian internationalism, and committed to stamping out any sign of \\"Jewish cultural particularism\\". Counter-revolutionary groups, including the Black Hundreds, opposed the Revolution with violent attacks on socialists and pogroms against Jews.

In 1918, the RSFSR Council of Ministers issued a decree entitled \\"On the Separation of Church from State and School from Church\\", depriving religious communities of the status of juridical persons, the right to own property and the right to enter into contracts. The decree nationalized the property of religious communities and banned their assessment of religious tuition. As a result, religion could be taught or studied only in private.Soviet Jewish Affairs Autumn-Winter 1990, 27. On 1 February 1918 the Commissariat for Jewish National Affairs was established as a subsection of the Commissariat for Nationality Affairs. It was mandated to establish the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat in the Jewish streets\\" and attract the Jewish masses to the regime while advising local and central institutions on Jewish issues. The Commissariat was also expected to fight the influence of Zionist and Jewish-Socialist Parties.Korey 1978, 79; Pinkus 1988, 58–59. On 27 July 1918 the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree stating that antisemitism is \\"fatal to the cause of the ... revolution\\". Pogroms were officially outlawed.Weinryb 1978, 306. On 20 October 1918 the Jewish section of the CPSU (Yevsektsia) was established for the Party's Jewish members; its goals were similar to those of the Jewish Commissariat.Survey January 1968, 77–81.Rothenberg 1978, 172–73; Levin 1988, 78–80.Pinkus 1988, 62. =Pogroms in western Ukraine= The pogroms which erupted in January 1919 in the northwest province of Volhynia spread during February and March to the cities, towns, and villages of many other regions of Ukraine. After Sarny it was the turn of Ovruc, northwest of Kyiv. In Tetiev on 25 March, approximately 4,000 Jews were murdered, half in a synagogue set ablaze by Cossack troops under Colonels Kurovsky, Cherkowsy, and Shliatoshenko. Then Vashilkov (6 and 7 April).Elias Tcherikower, \\"The Pogroms in Ukraine in 1919\\" originally in Yiddish, YIVO Institute, 1965; The Berdichev Revival. Retrieved 13 April 2012. In Dubovo (17 June) 800 Jews were decapitated in assembly-line fashion. According to David A. Chapin, the town of Proskurov (now Khmelnitsky), near the city of Sudilkov, \\"was the site of the worst atrocity committed against Jews this century before the Nazis.\\" Massive pogroms continued until 1921. =Pogroms across Podolia= On 15 February 1919, during the Ukrainian-Soviet war, Otaman Semesenko initiated a pogrom Proskurov in which many Jews were massacred on Shabbat (parashah Tesaveh) from three p.m. until next Sunday (?Saturday). Semesenko claimed that the pogrom was in retaliation for a previous Bolshevik Uprising, which he believed was led by Jews. According to the \\"pinqasim\\" record books the murdered in the pogrom included 390 men, 309 women and 76 children. The number of wounded exceeded 500. Two weeks later the Order 131 was published in the central newspaper by the head of Directorate of Ukraine. In it Symon Petliura denounced such actions and eventually executed Otaman Semesenko by firing-squad in November 1919. The Semesenko's brigade was disarmed and dissolved. This event is especially remarkable for being used to justify Schwartzbard for assassination of the Ukrainian leader in 1926. Although no facts of Petliura's direct involvement was ever proven, Schwartzbard was acquitted in light of revenge. The series of Jewish pogroms in various places around Ukraine culminated in the Kyiv pogroms of 1919 between June and October of that year.Michael L.

The kehillot had provided a number of social services to the Jewish community.Levin 1988, 81. From 1919–1920, Jewish parties and Zionist organizations were driven underground as the Communist government sought to abolish all potential opposition.Schechtman 1978, 113; Levin 1988, 90–91. The Yevsektsiya Jewish section of the Soviet Communist party was at the forefront of the anti-religious campaigns of the 1920s that led to the closing of religious institutions, the break-up of religious communities and the further restriction of access to religious education. To that end a series of \\"community trials\\" against the Jewish religion were held. The last known such trial, on the subject of circumcision, was held in 1928 in Kharkiv. At the same time, the body also worked to establish a secular identity for the Jewish community.Pinkus 1988, 62. In 1921 many Jews in the newly formed USSRCarr 1950, 401, 413. emigrated to Poland, as they were entitled by a peace treaty in Riga to choose the country they preferred. Several hundred thousand joined the already numerous Jewish minority of the Polish Second Republic. On 31 January 1924 the Commissariat for Nationalities' Affairs was disbanded.Pinkus 1988, 59. On 29 August 1924 an official agency for Jewish resettlement, the Commission for the Settlement of Jewish Toilers on the Land (KOMZET), was established. KOMZET studied, managed and funded projects for Jewish resettlement in rural areas.Levin 1988, 131; Schwarz 1951, 162–63. A public organization, the Society for the Agricultural Organization of Working Class Jews in the USSR (OZET), was created in January 1925 to help recruit colonists and support the colonization work of KOMZET.Pinkus 1988, 64. For the first few years the government encouraged Jewish settlements, particularly in Ukraine. Support for the project dwindled throughout the next decade.Levin 1988, 131–51. In 1938 OZET was disbanded, following years of declining activity. The Soviets set up three Jewish national raions in Ukraine as well as two in the Crimea – national raions occupied the 3rd level of the soviet system, but were all disbanded by the end of World War II.Pinkus 1988, 65. On 8 April 1929 the new Law on Religious Associations codified all previous religious legislation. All meetings of religious associations were to have their agenda approved in advance; lists of members of religious associations had to be provided to the authorities.Problems of Communism May–June 1973, 10–11. In 1930 the Yevsektsia was dissolved, and there was now no central Soviet-Jewish organization. Although the body had served to undermine Jewish religious life, its dissolution led to the disintegration of Jewish secular life as well; Jewish cultural and educational organizations gradually disappeared.Rothenberg 1978, 177–78. When the Soviet government reintroduced the use of internal passports in 1933, \\"Jewish\\" was considered an ethnicity for these purposes.Pinkus 1988, 57. The cities with the largest populations of Jews in 1926 were Odessa, 154,000 or 36.5% of the total population; Kyiv, 140,500 or 27.3%; Kharkiv, 81,500 or 19.5%; and Dnipropetrovsk, 62,000 or 26.7%.

Restrictions on Jews that had existed in the formerly independent countries were now lifted.Soviet Jewish Affairs Summer 1991, 53–54. At the same time, Jewish organizations in the newly acquired territories were shut down and their leaders were arrested and exiled.Baron 1964, 294. Approximately 250,000 Jews escaped or were evacuated from the annexed territories to the Soviet interior prior to the Nazi invasion.Gitelman 1993, 4. Jewish settlement in Crimea In 1921, Crimea became an autonomous republic. In 1923, the All-Union Central Committee passed a motion to resettle a large number of the Jewish population from Ukrainian and Belarusian cities to Crimea. 50400 families were moved. The plan to further resettle Jewish families was again confirmed by the Central Committee of the USSR on 15 July 1926 assigning 124 million roubles to the task and also receiving 67 million from foreign sources.Сергійчук, В. Український Крим К. 2001, p. 150 The Soviet initiative of Jewish settlement in Crimea was opposed by Symon Petlura,Петлюра С. Статті, листи, документи – Н. Й. 1979 – Vol 2, p. 428 which he regarded as a provocation. This train of thought was supported by Arnold MargolinMargolin A. \\"The New Palestine\\", December 1926 also Тризуб, 1927 ч. 14 p. 13-14 who stated that it would be dangerous to set up Jewish colonies there. The actions of the Soviet government for the supported settlement in Crimea with Jewish families by 1927 led to a growing antisemitism in the area. In 1944, it was suggested to Stalin to form a Jewish Soviet Socialist Republic in Crimea, however, the idea was not materialised. World War II A map of the Holocaust in Ukraine Total civilian losses during the war and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at seven million, including over a million Jews shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen and by local Ukrainian supporters in various regions of Ukraine. Post-war situation Ukraine had 840,000 Jews in 1959, a decrease of almost 70% from 1941 (within Ukraine's current borders). Ukraine's Jewish population declined significantly during the Cold War. In 1989, Ukraine's Jewish population was only slightly more than half of what it was thirty years earlier (in 1959). The overwhelming majority of the Jews who remained in Ukraine in 1989 left Ukraine and moved to other countries (mostly to Israel) in the 1990s during and after the collapse of Communism. Such new immigrants to Israel included artists, such as Marina Maximilian Blumin and street artist Klone, as well as activists, such as Gennady Riger and Lia Shemtov. Independent Ukraine In 1989, a Soviet census counted 487,000 Jews living in Ukraine. Although discrimination by the state all but halted very soon after Ukrainian independence in 1991, Jews were still discriminated against in Ukraine during the 1990s. For instance, Jews were not allowed to attend some educational institutions.

Jews lived in all parts of the lands of modern Belarus. Jews were the third largest ethnic group in the country in the first half of the 20th century. In 1897, the Jewish population of Belarus reached 910,900, or 14.2% of the total population. Following the Polish-Soviet War (1919-1920), under the terms of the Treaty of Riga, Belarus was split into Eastern Belorussia (under Soviet occupation) and Western Belorussia (under Polish occupation), and causing 350,000-450,000 of the Jews to be governed by Poland. Prior to World War II, Jews remained the third largest ethnic groups in Belarus and comprised more than 40% of the population in cities and towns. The population of cities such as Minsk, Pinsk, Mahiliou, Babrujsk, Viciebsk, and Homiel was more than 50% Jewish. In 1926 and 1939 there were between 375,000 and 407,000 Jews in Belarus (Eastern Belorussia) or 6.7-8.2% of the total population. Following the Soviet annexation of Eastern Poland in 1939, including Western Belorussia, Belarus would again have 1,175,000 Jews within its borders, including 275,000 Jews from Poland, Ukraine, and elsewhere. It is estimated 800,000 of 900,000 — 90% of the Jews of Belarus —were killed during the Holocaust. According to the 2009 national census, there were 12,926 self- identifying Jews in Belarus. The Jewish Agency estimates the community of Jews in Belarus at 20,000. However, the number of Belarusians with Jewish descent is assumed to be higher.Israeli Ambassador: the closure of the embassy in Minsk was refused due to special relations Alexey ALEXANDROV / 02/16/2017 / 16:24 / Politics Early history Throughout several centuries the lands of modern Belarus and the Republic of Lithuania were both parts of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Therefore, the history of Belarusian Jews is closely related to the history of Jews in Lithuania. As early as the 8th century Jews lived in parts of the lands of modern Belarus. Beginning with that period they conducted the trade between Ruthenia, Lithuania, and the Baltic, especially with Danzig, Julin (Vineta or Wollin, in Pomerania), and other cities on the Vistula, Oder, and Elbe. The origin of Belarusian Jews has been the subject of much speculation. It is believed that they were made up of two distinct streams of Jewish immigration. The older and significantly smaller of the two entered the territory that would later become the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the east. These early immigrants spoke Judeo-Slavic dialects which distinguished them from the later Jewish immigrants who entered the region from the Germanic lands. While the origin of these eastern Jews is not certain, historical evidence places Jewish refugees from Babylonia, Palestine, the Byzantine Empire and other Jewish refugees and settlers in the lands between the Baltic and Black Seas that would become part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The later and much larger stream of immigration originated in the 12th century and received an impetus from the persecution of the German Jews by the Crusaders. The traditional language of the vast majority of Lithuanian Jews, Yiddish, is based largely upon the Medieval German and Hebrew spoken by the western Germanic Jewish immigrants. The peculiar conditions that prevailed in Belarus compelled the first Jewish settlers to adopt a different mode of life from that followed by their western ethnic brethren. At that time there were no cities in the western sense of the word in Belarus, no Magdeburg Rights or close guilds at that time. Some of the cities which later became the important centers of Jewish life in Belarus were at first mere villages. Hrodna, one of the oldest, was first mentioned in the chronicles of 1128. Navahrudak was founded somewhat later by Yaroslav I the Wise; Kerlov in 1250; Voruta and Twiremet in 1252; Eiragola in 1262; Halshany and Kowno in 1280; Lida, Telšiai, Vilna and Troki in 1320. Increasing prosperity and the great charter (1320–1432) With the campaign of Hiedzimin and his subjection of Kiev and Volhynia (1320–1321) the Jewish inhabitants of these territories were induced to spread throughout the northern provinces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The probable importance of the southern Jews in the development of Belarus and Lithuania is indicated by their numerical prominence in Volhynia in the 13th century. According to an annalist who describes the funeral of the grand duke Vladimir Vasilkovich in the city of Vladimir (Volhynia), \\"the Jews wept at his funeral as at the fall of Jerusalem, or when being led into the Babylonian captivity.\\"Quoted in: Rosenthal, Herman (1904). \\"Lithuania.\\" The Jewish Encyclopedia. Ed. Isidor Singer. New York: Funk and Wagnalls. p. 118-130; here: p. 119. This sympathy and the record thereof would seem to indicate that long before the event in question the Jews had enjoyed considerable prosperity and influence, and this gave them a certain standing under the new régime. They took an active part in the development of the new cities under the tolerant rule of duke Hiedzimin. Little is known of the fortunes of the Belarusian Jews during the troublous times that followed the death of Hiedzimin and the accession of his grandson Vitaut (1341). To the latter, the Jews owed a charter of privileges which was momentous in the subsequent history of the Jews of Belarus and Lithuania. The documents granting privileges first to the Jews of Brest (July 1, 1388) and later to those of Hrodna, Troki (1389), Lutsk, Vladimir, and other large towns are the earliest documents to recognize the Jews of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as possessing a distinct organization. The gathering together of the scattered Jewish settlers in sufficient numbers and with enough power to form such an organization and to obtain privileges from their Lithuanian rulers implies the lapse of considerable time. The Jews who dwelt in smaller towns and villages were not in need of such privileges at this time, and the mode of life, as Abraham Harkavy suggests, \\"the comparative poverty, and the ignorance of Jewish learning among the Lithuanian Jews retarded their intercommunal organization.\\" But powerful forces hastened this organization toward the close of the 14th century. The chief of these was probably the cooperation of the Jews of Poland with their brethren in the GDL. After the death of Casimir III (1370), the condition of the Polish Jews changed for the worse. The influence of the Roman Catholic clergy at the Polish court grew; Louis of Anjou was indifferent to the welfare of his subjects, and his eagerness to convert the Jews to Christianity, together with the increased Jewish immigration from Germany, caused the Polish Jews to become apprehensive for their future. =The Charter of 1388= On this account it seems more than likely that influential Polish Jews cooperated with the leading Belarusian and Lithuanian communities in securing a special charter from Vitaut (Witold). The preamble of the charter reads as follows: :In the name of God, Amen. All deeds of men, when they are not made known by the testimony of witnesses or in writing, pass away and vanish and are forgotten. Therefore, we, Alexander, also called Vitovt, by the grace of God Grand Duke of Lithuania and ruler of Brest, Dorogicz, Lutsk, Vladimir, and other places, make known by this charter to the present and future generations, or to whomever it may concern to know or hear of it, that, after due deliberation with our nobles we have decided to grant to all the Jews living in our domains the rights and liberties mentioned in the following charter. The charter itself was modeled upon similar documents granted by Casimir the Great, and earlier by Boleslaw of Kalisz, to the Jews in Poland in 1084. Under the charter, the Jews of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania formed a class of freemen subject in all criminal cases directly to the jurisdiction of the grand duke and his official representatives, and in petty suits to the jurisdiction of local officials on an equal footing with the lesser nobles (szlachta), boyars, and other free citizens. The official representatives of the grand duke were the elder (starosta), known as the \\"Jewish judge\\" (judex Judæorum), and his deputy. The Jewish judge decided all cases between Christians and Jews and all criminal suits in which Jews were concerned; in civil suits, however, he acted only on the application of the interested parties. Either party who failed to obey the judge's summons had to pay him a fine. To him also belonged all fines collected from Jews for minor offenses. His duties included the guardianship of the persons, property, and freedom of worship of the Jews. He had no right to summon any one to his court except upon the complaint of an interested party. In matters of religion the Jews were given extensive autonomy. Under these equitable laws the Jews of Belarus and Lithuania reached a degree of prosperity unknown to their Polish and German co-religionists at that time. The communities of Brest, Hrodna, Minsk, Troki and Lutsk rapidly grew in wealth and influence. Every community had at its head a Jewish elder. These elders represented the communities in all external relations, in securing new privileges, and in the regulation of taxes. Such officials are not, however, referred to by the title \\"elder\\" before the end of the 16th century. Up to that time the documents merely state, for instance, that the \\"Jews of Brest humbly apply,\\" etc. On assuming office the elders declared under oath that they would discharge the duties of the position faithfully, and would relinquish the office at the expiration of the appointed term. The elder acted in conjunction with the rabbi, whose jurisdiction included all Jewish affairs with the exception of judicial cases assigned to the court of the deputy, and by the latter to the king. In religious affairs, however, an appeal from the decision of the rabbi and the elder was permitted only to a council consisting of the chief rabbis of the king's cities. The cantor, sexton, and shochet were subject to the orders of the rabbi and elder. The goodwill and tolerance of Vitaut endeared him to his Jewish subjects, and for a long time traditions concerning his generosity and nobility of character were current among them. His cousin, the king of Poland Jagiello, did not interfere with his administration during Vitaut's lifetime. Jagiellon rule In 1569 Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were united. It was generally a time of prosperity and relative safety for the Jews of both countries (with the exception of the Chmielnicki Uprising in the 17th century). However, a few events, such as the expulsion of the Jews from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania between 1495 and 1503 occurred just within the Grand Duchy. =Expulsion of the Jews in 1495 and return in 1503= Casimir was succeeded as king of Poland by his son John Albert, and on the Lithuanian throne by his younger son, Alexander Jagellon. The latter confirmed the charter of privileges granted to the Jews by his predecessors, and even gave them additional rights. His father's Jewish creditors received part of the sums due to them, the rest being withheld under various pretexts. The favorable attitude toward the Jews which had characterized the Lithuanian rulers for generations was unexpectedly and radically changed by a decree promulgated by Alexander in April, 1495. By this decree all Jews living in Lithuania proper and the adjacent territories were summarily ordered to leave the country. The expulsion was evidently not accompanied by the usual cruelties; for there was no popular animosity toward the Jews, and the decree was regarded as an act of mere willfulness on the part of an absolute ruler. Some of the nobility, however, approved Alexander's decree, expecting to profit by the departure of their Jewish creditors, as is indicated by numerous lawsuits on the return of the exiles to Lithuania in 1503. It is known from the Hebrew sources that some of the exiles migrated to the Crimea, and that by far the greater number settled in Poland, where, by permission of King John Albert, they established themselves in the towns situated near the boundary of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This permission, given at first for a period of two years, was extended \\"because of the extreme poverty of the Jews on account of the great losses sustained by them.\\" The extension, which applied to all the towns of the kingdom, accorded the enjoyment of all the liberties that had been granted to their Polish brethren (Kraków, June 29, 1498). The expelled Karaites settled in the Polish town of Ratno. The causes of the unexpected expulsion were probably many, including religious reasons, the need to fill a depleted treasury by confiscating the Jews' money, personal animosity, and other causes. Soon after Alexander's accession to the throne of Poland he permitted the Jewish exiles to return to Lithuania. Beginning in March, 1503, as is shown by documents still extant, their houses, lands, synagogues, and cemeteries were returned to them, and permission was granted them to collect their old debts. The new charter of privileges permitted them to live throughout Lithuania as before. The return of the Jews and their attempt to regain their old possessions led to many difficulties and lawsuits. Alexander found it necessary to issue an additional decree (April, 1503), directing his vice-regent to enforce the law. In spite of this some of the property was not recovered by the Jews for years. =The Act of 1566= The middle of the 16th century witnessed a growing antagonism between the lesser nobility and the Jews. Their relations became strained, and the enmity of the Christians began to disturb the life of the Litvak Jews. The anti-Jewish feeling, due at first to economic causes engendered by competition, was fostered by the clergy, who were then engaged in a crusade against \\"heretics,\\" notably the Lutherans, Calvinists, and Jews. The Reformation, which had spread from Germany, tended to weaken the allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. Frequent instances occurred of the marriage of Catholic women to Jews, Turks, or Tatars. The Bishop of Wilno (Vilnius) complained to Sigismund August (Dec., 1548) of the frequency of such mixed marriages and of the education of the offspring in their fathers' faiths. The szlachta also saw in the Jews dangerous competitors in commercial and financial undertakings. In their dealings with the agricultural classes the lords preferred the Jews as middlemen, thus creating a feeling of injury on the part of the szlachta. The exemption of the Jews from military service and the power and wealth of the Jewish tax-farmers intensified the resentment of the szlachta. Members of the nobility, like Bardzo bogaty, Ród Zagórowskich, (Strzemie coat of arms) and others, attempted to compete with the Jews as leaseholders of customs revenues, but were never successful. Since the Jews lived in the towns and on the lands of the king, the nobility could not wield any authority over them nor derive profit from them. They had not even the right to settle Jews on their estates without the permission of the king; but, on the other hand, they were often annoyed by the erection on their estates of the tollhouses of the Jewish tax-collectors. Hence when the favorable moment arrived, the Lithuanian nobility endeavored to secure greater power over the Jews. At the Diet of Vilna in 1551 the nobility urged the imposition of a special polltax of one ducat per head, and the Volhynian nobles demanded that the Jewish tax-collectors be forbidden to erect tollhouses or place guards at the taverns on their estates. The opposition to the Jews was finally crystallized and found definite expression in the repressive Lithuanian statute of 1566, when the nobles of Belarus and Lithuania were first allowed to take part in the national legislation. Paragraph Twelve of this statute contains the following articles: :\\"The Jews shall not wear costly clothing, nor gold chains, nor shall their wives wear gold or silver ornaments. The Jews shall not have silver mountings on their sabers and daggers; they shall be distinguished by characteristic clothes; they shall wear yellow caps, and their wives kerchiefs of yellow linen, in order that all may be enabled to distinguish Jews from Christians.\\" Other restrictions of a similar nature are contained in the same paragraph. However, the king checked the desire of the nobility to modify essentially the old charters of the Jews. Effect of the Cossacks' Uprising in Belarus The fury of the 1648–1657 Cossack rebellion in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth destroyed the organization of the Jewish communities in Belarus. The survivors who returned to their old homes in the latter half of the 17th century were practically destitute. The wars which raged constantly in the Lithuanian territory brought ruin to the entire country and deprived the Jews of the opportunity to earn more than a bare livelihood. The intensity of their struggle for existence left them no time to reestablish the conditions which had existed up to 1648. John Casimir (1648–1668) sought to ameliorate their condition by granting various concessions to the Jewish communities of Lithuania. Attempts to return to the old order in the communal organization were not wanting, as is evident from contemporary documents. Thus in 1672, Jewish elders from various towns and villages in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania secured a charter from King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki (1669–1673), decreeing \\"that on account of the increasing number of Jews guilty of offenses against the Szlachta and other Christians, which result in the enmity of the Christians toward the Jews, and because of the inability of the Jewish elders to punish such offenders, who are protected by the lords, the king permits the kahals to summon the criminals before the Jewish courts for punishment and exclusion from the community when necessary.\\" The efforts to resurrect the old power of the kahals were not successful. The impoverished Jewish merchants, having no capital of their own, were compelled to borrow money from the nobility, from churches, congregations, monasteries, and various religious orders. Loans from the latter were usually for an unlimited period and were secured by mortgages on the real estate of the kahal. The kahals thus became hopelessly indebted to the clergy and the nobility. In 1792 the Jewish population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was estimated at 250,000 (as compared with 120,000 in 1569). The whole of the commerce and industries of the country, now rapidly declining, was in the hands of the Jews. The nobility lived for the most part on their estates and farms, some of which were managed by Jewish leaseholders. The city properties were concentrated in the possession of monasteries, churches, and the lesser nobility. The Christian merchants were poor. Such was the condition of affairs in Belarus at the time of the second partition of Poland (1793), when the Jews became subjects of Russia. Jewish culture in Belarus The founding of the yeshivas in Belarus was due to the Lithuanian-Polish Jews who studied in the west, and to the German Jews who migrated about that time to Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. Very little is known of these early yeshivas. No mention is made of them or of prominent Lithuanian rabbis in Jewish writings until the 16th century. The first known rabbinical authority and head of a yeshiva was Isaac Bezaleel of Vladimir, Volhynia, who was already an old man when Solomon Luria went to Ostrog in the fourth decade of the 16th century. Another rabbinical authority, Kalman Haberkaster, rabbi of Ostrog and predecessor of Luria, died in 1559. Occasional references to the yeshiva of Brest are found in the writings of the contemporary rabbis Solomon Luria (d. 1585), Moses Isserles (d. 1572), and David Gans (d. 1589), who speak of its activity. Of the yeshiva of Ostrog and Vladimir in Volhynia it is known that they were in a flourishing condition at the middle of the 16th century, and that their heads vied with one another in Talmudic scholarship. Mention is also made by Gans of the head of the Kremenetz yeshiva, Isaac Cohen (d. 1573), of whom but little is known otherwise. Volozhin yeshivaAt the time of the Lublin Union, Solomon Luria was rabbi of Ostrog, and was regarded as one of the greatest Talmudic authorities in Poland and the GDL. In 1568 King Sigismund ordered that the suits between Isaac Borodavka and Mendel Isakovich, who were partners in the farming of certain customs taxes in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, be carried for decision to Rabbi Solomon Luria and two auxiliary rabbis from Pinsk and Tiktin. The far-reaching authority of the leading rabbis of Poland and Lithuania, and their wide knowledge of practical life, are apparent from numerous decisions cited in the responsa. They were always the champions of justice and morality. In the Eitan ha-Ezrachi (Ostrog, 1796) of Abraham Rapoport (known also as Abraham Schrenzel; d. 1650), Rabbi Meïr Sack is cited as follows: \\"I emphatically protest against the custom of our communal leaders of purchasing the freedom of Jewish criminals. Such a policy encourages crime among our people. I am especially troubled by the fact that, thanks to the clergy, such criminals may escape punishment by adopting Christianity. Mistaken piety impels our leaders to bribe the officials, in order to prevent such conversions. We should endeavor to deprive criminals of opportunities to escape justice.\\" The same sentiment was expressed in the 16th century by Maharam Lublin (Responsa, § 138). Another instance, cited by Katz from the same responsa, likewise shows that Jewish criminals invoked the aid of priests against the authority of Jewish courts by promising to become converts to Christianity. Building of a synagogue in Slonim, origin of the Slonim Hasidic dynastyThe decisions of the Polish-Lithuanian rabbis are frequently marked by breadth of view also, as is instanced by a decision of Joel Sirkes (Bayis Hadash, § 127) to the effect that Jews may employ in their religious services the melodies used in Christian churches, \\"since music is neither Jewish nor Christian, and is governed by universal laws.\\" Decisions by Luria, Meïr Katz, and Mordecai Jaffe show that the rabbis were acquainted with the Russian language and its philology. Jaffe, for instance, in a divorce case where the spelling of the woman's name as Lupka or Lubka was in question, decided that the word is correctly spelled with a \\"b,\\" and not with a \\"p,\\" since the origin of the name was the Russian verb = \\"to love,\\" and not = \\"to beat\\" (Levush ha- Butz we-Argaman, § 129). Meïr Katz (Geburat Anashim, § 1) explains that the name of Brest-Litovsk is written in divorce cases \\"Brest\\" and not \\"Brisk,\\" \\"because the majority of the Lithuanian Jews use the Russian language.\\" It is not so with Brisk, in the district of Kujawa, the name of that town being always spelled \\"Brisk.\\" Katz (a German) at the conclusion of his responsum expresses the hope that when Lithuania shall have become more enlightened, the people will speak one language only—German—and that also Brest-Litovsk will be written \\"Brisk.\\" =Items from the Responsa= The responsa shed an interesting light also on the life of the Lithuanian Jews and on their relations to their Christian neighbors. Benjamin Aaron Solnik states in his Mas'at Binyamin (end of sixteenth and beginning of 17th century) that \\"the Christians borrow clothes and jewelry from the Jews when they go to church.\\" Sirkes (l.c. § 79) relates that a Christian woman came to the rabbi and expressed her regret at having been unable to save the Jew Shlioma from drowning. A number of Christians had looked on indifferently while the drowning Jew was struggling in the water. They were upbraided and beaten severely by the priest, who appeared a few minutes later, for having failed to rescue the Jew. Luria gives an account (Responsa, § 20) of a quarrel that occurred in a Lithuanian community concerning a cantor whom some of the members wished to dismiss. The synagogue was closed in order to prevent him from exercising his functions, and religious services were thus discontinued for several days. The matter was thereupon carried to the local lord, who ordered the reopening of the building, saying that the house of God might not be closed, and that the cantor's claims should be decided by the learned rabbis of Lithuania. Joseph Katz mentions (She'erit Yosef, § 70) a Jewish community which was forbidden by the local authorities to kill cattle and to sell meat—an occupation which provided a livelihood for a large portion of the Lithuanian Jews. For the period of a year following this prohibition the Jewish community was on several occasions assessed at the rate of three gulden per head of cattle in order to furnish funds with which to induce the officials to grant a hearing of the case. The Jews finally reached an agreement with the town magistrates under which they were to pay forty gulden annually for the right to slaughter cattle. According to Hillel ben Herz (Bet Hillel, Yoreh De'ah, § 157), Naphtali says the Jews of Vilna had been compelled to uncover when taking an oath in court, but later purchased from the tribunal the privilege to swear with covered head, a practise subsequently made unnecessary by a decision of one of their rabbis to the effect that an oath might be taken with uncovered head. The responsa of Meïr Lublin show (§ 40) that the Lithuanian communities frequently aided the German and the Austrian Jews. On the expulsion of the Jews from Silesia, when the Jewish inhabitants of Silz had the privilege of remaining on condition that they would pay the sum of 2,000 gulden, the Lithuanian communities contributed one- fifth of the amount. Belarusian Jews under the Russian Empire Map of the Pale of Settlement. Upon annexation of Belarusian lands, Russian czars included the territory into the so-called Pale of Settlement, a western border region of Imperial Russia in which the permanent residence of Jews was allowed. Though comprising only 20% of the territory of European Russia, the Pale corresponded to the historical borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and included much of present-day Belarus, Republic of Lithuania, Poland, Moldova, Ukraine, and parts of western Russia. By the end of the 19th century, many Belarusian Jews were part of the general flight of Jews from Eastern Europe to the New World due to conflicts and pogroms engulfing the Russian Empire and the anti-Semitism of the Russian czars. Millions of Jews, including tens of thousands of Jews from Belarus, emigrated to the United States of America and South Africa. A small number also emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine. After the October Revolution Jewish political organizations, including the General Jewish Labour Bund, participated in the creation of the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918. During the first years of Soviet occupation of Belarus, Jews were able to get managing positions in the country. For some time in the 1920s, Yiddish was an official language in East Belarus along with Belarusian, Polish and Russian. Yakov Gamarnik, a Ukrainian Jew, was First Secretary of the Communist Party of Belorussia (i.e. the de facto head of state) from December 1928 to October 1929. However, the Soviet policy later turned against the Jews (see Stalin's antisemitism). World War II Atrocities against the Jewish population in the German-conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of Einsatzgruppen (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them. Local anti- semites were encouraged to carry out their own pogroms. By the end of 1941, there were more than 5,000 troops devoted to rounding up and killing Jews. The gradual industrialization of killing led to adoption of the Final Solution and the establishment of the Operation Reinhard extermination camps: the machinery of the Holocaust. Of the Soviet Jews who were killed in the Holocaust, 246,000 Jews were Belarusian: some 66% of the total number of Belarusian Jews.

In the second half of the 20th century, there was a large wave of Belarusian Jews immigrating to Israel (see Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s), as well as to the United States. In 1979, there were 135,400 Jews in Belarus; a decade later, 112,000 were left. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Belarusian independence saw most of the community, along with the majority of the former Soviet Union's Jewish population, leave for Israel (see Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s). The 1999 census estimated that there were only 29,000 Jews left in the country.Census data cited in: Zeltser, Arkadi (July 15, 2010). \\"Belarus.\\" YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.

About half of the country's Jews live in Minsk. National Jewish organizations, local cultural groups, religious schools, charitable organizations, and organizations for war veterans and Holocaust survivors have been formed. Since the mass immigration of the 1990s, there has been some continuous immigration to Israel. In 2002, 974 Belarusians moved to Israel, and between 2003 and 2005, 4,854 followed suit.

History =Spanish dollar (17th – 19th centuries)= In the 17th and 18th centuries, the use of silver Spanish dollars or eight-real coins, also known as \\"pieces of eight\\" extended from the Spanish territories in the Americas westwards to Asia and eastwards to Europe, forming the first worldwide currency. Spain's political supremacy on the world stage, the importance of Spanish commercial routes across the Atlantic and the Pacific, and the coin's quality and purity of silver helped it become internationally accepted for about three centuries. It was legal tender in Spain's Pacific territories of Philippines, Guam and Micronesia, and later in China and other Southeast Asian countries until the mid-19th century. In the Americas it was legal tender in all of South and Central America (except Brazil) and in the US and Canada until the 19th century. The Spanish dollar was legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857. In Europe it was legal tender in the Iberian Peninsula, most of Italy including: Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, in the Franche-Comté (France), and in the Spanish Netherlands. It was also used in other European states including the Austrian Habsburg territories. After Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish dollar continued to be used in many parts of the Americas, together with the Mexican Peso from the 1860s onward. The Mexican peso, the US dollar and the Canadian dollar all trace their origins back to the Spanish dollar, including the use of the peso sign ($), also known as the dollar sign. =Gold standard (19th – 20th centuries)= Prior to and during most of the 19th century, international trade was denominated in terms of currencies that represented weights of gold. Most national currencies at the time were in essence merely different ways of measuring gold weights (much as the yard and the meter both measure length and are related by a constant conversion factor). Hence some assert that gold was the world's first global currency. The emerging collapse of the international gold standard around the time of World War I had significant implications for global trade. Distinct from the overarching gold standard system, between the 1860s and 1920s several deliberately supranational currencies existed: national currencies were fixed at par, and mutually-accepted as legal tender in participating countries. Chief among these was the Latin Monetary Union, pegged to the French franc and mainly in use in Romance-speaking European states; but other regional currencies existed, such as that pegged to the Swedish krona and used by the Northern-European countries of the Scandinavian Monetary Union. =Pound sterling= Before 1944, the world reference currency was the United Kingdom's pound sterling. The transition between pound sterling and United States dollar and its impact for central banks was described recently.\\"The Retirement of Sterling as a Reserve Currency after 1945: Lessons for the US Dollar ? \\", Catherine R. Schenk, Canadian Network for Economic History conference,10/2009 =U.S. dollar= right|300px|thumb|Worldwide use of the euro and the US$ The Belarusian ruble is pegged to the euro, Russian ruble and U.S. dollar in a currency basket. In the period following the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, exchange rates around the world were pegged to the United States dollar, which could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold. This reinforced the dominance of the US dollar as a global currency. Since the collapse of the fixed exchange rate regime and the gold standard and the institution of floating exchange rates following the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971, most currencies around the world have no longer been pegged to the United States dollar. However, as the United States has the world's largest economy, most international transactions continue to be conducted with the United States dollar, and it has remained the de facto world currency. According to Robert Gilpin in Global Political Economy: Understanding the International Economic Order (2001): \\"Somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of international financial transactions are denominated in dollars. For decades the dollar has also been the world's principal reserve currency; in 1996, the dollar accounted for approximately two-thirds of the world's foreign exchange reserves\\", as compared to about one-quarter held in euros (see Reserve Currency). Some of the world's currencies are still pegged to the dollar. Some countries, such as Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama, have gone even further and eliminated their own currency (see dollarization) in favor of the United States dollar. Only two serious challengers to the status of the United States dollar as a world currency have arisen. During the 1980s, the Japanese yen became increasingly used as an international currency, but that usage diminished with the Japanese recession in the 1990s. More recently, the euro has increasingly competed with the United States dollar in international finance. =Euro= The euro inherited its status as a major reserve currency from the German mark (DM) and its contribution to official reserves has increased as banks seek to diversify their reserves and trade in the eurozone expands. As with the dollar, some of the world's currencies are pegged against the euro. They are usually Eastern European currencies like the Bulgarian lev, plus several west African currencies like the Cape Verdean escudo and the CFA franc. Other European countries, while not being EU members, have adopted the euro due to currency unions with member states, or by unilaterally superseding their own currencies: Andorra, Monaco, Kosovo, Montenegro, San Marino, and Vatican City. , the euro surpassed the dollar in the combined value of cash in circulation. The value of euro notes in circulation has risen to more than €610 billion, equivalent to US$800 billion at the exchange rates at the time. A 2016 report by the World Trade Organisation shows that the world's energy, food and services trade are made 60% with US dollar and 40% by euro. = Chinese Yuan = As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, as of 2013 it was the world's eight most widely traded currency. At the end of November, 2015, the Chinese renminbi was designated as one of the world's global currencies, and became one of the currency in the currency basket known as special drawing rights. =Recent proposals (21st century)= Governmental On 16 March 2009, in connection with the April 2009 G20 summit, the Kremlin called for a supranational reserve currency as part of a reform of the global financial system. In a document containing proposals for the G20 meeting, it suggested that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (or an Ad Hoc Working Group of G20) should be instructed to carry out specific studies to review the following options: * Enlargement (diversification) of the list of currencies used as reserve ones, based on agreed measures to promote the development of major regional financial centers. In this context, we should consider possible establishment of specific regional mechanisms which would contribute to reducing volatility of exchange rates of such reserve currencies. * Introduction of a supra-national reserve currency to be issued by international financial institutions. It seems appropriate to consider the role of IMF in this process and to review the feasibility of and the need for measures to ensure the recognition of SDRs as a \\"supra-reserve\\" currency by the whole world community.\\"Russian Proposals to the London Summit (April 2009). Kremlin website. 16 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009.At G20, Kremlin to Pitch New Currency. Moscow Times. 17 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009. On 24 March 2009, Zhou Xiaochuan, President of the People's Bank of China, called for \\"creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\\" believing it would \\"significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\\"China presses G20 reform plans. BBC News, 24 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009. Zhou suggested that the IMF's special drawing rights (a currency basket comprising dollars, euros, renminbi, yen, and sterling) could serve as a super-sovereign reserve currency, not easily influenced by the policies of individual countries. US President Obama, however, rejected the suggestion stating that \\"the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now.\\"Obama rejects China's call for new global currency . AFP, 25 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009. At the G8 summit in July 2009, the Russian president expressed Russia's desire for a new supranational reserve currency by showing off a coin minted with the words \\"unity in diversity\\". The coin, an example of a future world currency, emphasized his call for creating a mix of regional currencies as a way to address the global financial crisis. On 30 March 2009, at the Second South America-Arab League Summit in Qatar, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez proposed the creation of a petro-currency. It would be backed by the huge oil reserves of the oil-producing countries. Chavez's successor, President Nicholás Maduro, in 2018 announced the Petro cryptocurrency. Single world currency An alternative definition of a world or global currency refers to a hypothetical single global currency or supercurrency, as the proposed terra or the DEY (acronym for Dollar Euro Yen), produced and supported by a central bank which is used for all transactions around the world, regardless of the nationality of the entities (individuals, corporations, governments, or other organizations) involved in the transaction. No such official currency currently exists. Advocates, notably Keynes, of a global currency often argue that such a currency would not suffer from inflation, which, in extreme cases, has had disastrous effects for economies. In addition, many argue that a single global currency would make conducting international business more efficient and would encourage foreign direct investment (FDI). There are many different variations of the idea, including a possibility that it would be administered by a global central bank that would define its own monetary standard or that it would be on the gold standard. Supporters often point to the euro as an example of a supranational currency successfully implemented by a union of nations with disparate languages, cultures, and economies. A limited alternative would be a world reserve currency issued by the International Monetary Fund, as an evolution of the existing special drawing rights and used as reserve assets by all national and regional central banks. On 26 March 2009, a UN panel of expert economists called for a new global currency reserve scheme to replace the current US dollar-based system. The panel's report pointed out that the \\"greatly expanded SDR (special drawing rights), with regular or cyclically adjusted emissions calibrated to the size of reserve accumulations, could contribute to global stability, economic strength and global equity.\\"UN panel touts new global currency reserve system. AFP, 26 March 2009. Retrieved 27 March 2009. Another world currency was proposed to use conceptual currency to aid the transaction between countries. The basic idea is to utilize the balance of trade to cancel out the currency actually needed to trade. In addition to the idea of a single world currency, some evidence suggests the world may evolve multiple global currencies that exchange on a singular market system. The rise of digital global currencies owned by privately held companies or groups such as Ven suggest that multiple global currencies may offer wider formats for trade as they gain strength and wider acceptance. WOCU currency, based on the WOCU synthetic global currency quotation derived from a weighted basket of currencies of fiat currency pairs covering the top 20 economies of the world, is planned to be issued and distributed http://www.wocu.com/news/wocu- currency-with-unite-global by Unite Globalhttps://www.bankingtech.com/2019/01/unite-global-to-launch-real-time- correspondent-hub a centralised platform for global real-time payments and settlement. Bitcoin Bitcoin offers the possibility that a decentralized system that works with little human intervention could eliminate squabbling over who would administer the world central bank. XRP become the first global currency in 2020 Difficulties =Limited additional benefit with extra cost= Some economists argue that a single world currency is unnecessary, because the U.S. dollar is providing many of the benefits of a world currency while avoiding some of the costs However, this de facto situation gives the U.S. government additional power over other countries (see for example the Iraq war when Iraq wanted to switch to the Euro for oil pricing). If the world does not form an optimum currency area, then it would be economically inefficient for the world to share one currency. =Economically incompatible nations= In the present world, nations are not able to work together closely enough to be able to produce and support a common currency. There has to be a high level of trust between different countries before a true world currency could be created. A world currency might even undermine national sovereignty of smaller states. =Wealth redistribution= The interest rate set by the central bank indirectly determines the interest rate customers must pay on their bank loans. This interest rate affects the rate of interest among individuals, investments, and countries. Lending to the poor involves more risk than lending to the rich. As a result of the larger differences in wealth in different areas of the world, a central bank's ability to set interest rate to make the area prosper will be increasingly compromised, since it places wealthiest regions in conflict with the poorest regions in debt. =Usury= Usury – the accumulation of interest on loan principal – is prohibited by the texts of some major religions. In Christianity and Judaism, adherents are forbidden to charge interest to other adherents or to the poor (Leviticus 25:35–38; Deuteronomy 23:19). Islam forbids usury, known in Arabic as riba. Some religious adherents who oppose the paying of interest are currently able to use banking facilities in their countries which regulate interest. An example of this is the Islamic banking system, which is characterized by a nation's central bank setting interest rates for most other transactions.

Myers. 1999. Coral Reef Fishes. They can grow up to be about . Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict size-based dominance hierarchy; the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male nonbreeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male changes to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest nonbreeder becoming the breeding male. The fish's natural diet includes algae and zooplankton. Description The characteristic that defines this genus is the spine on the cheek. The colors of the body and bars vary according to sex and geographic location. Despite the common name maroon clownfish, only some females have a maroon body color, with a range of color to dark brown. Juveniles and males are bright red-orange. The fish has three body bars which may be white, grey, or yellow. Where the female bars are grey, they can be \\"switched\\" rapidly to white if fish is provoked. The size-based dominance hierarchy means in any group of anemonefish, the female is always larger than the male. A significant difference in size is seen in this species, with females being one of the largest anemonefish, growing up to while males are much smaller, usually being . =Color variations= The significant color variations for fish in this species are related to sex and geographic location. Male and juvenile fish are bright red-orange which darkens on the fish changing to female, ranging from maroon to dark brown. The body bars of the female are narrower and the body bars reportedly all but disappear in older females. At least three geographic variations in the color of females are found, with fish from East Timor to Australia retaining white body bars. In the central Malay Archipelago, the head bar tends towards a dull yellow, with the other two body bars being grey. In Sumatra and Andaman Islands, all three body bars are yellow for both male and female, and the female body color can range from a dull maroon to a dark brown. While other species have a blue tinge to their body bars, Amphiprion chrysopterus and A. latezonatus, this geographic variety, is the only anemonefish to have yellow or gold body bars. Central Malay Archipelago The female in the Central Malay Archipelago, from North Sulawesi and the Philippines in the north to Komodo Island in the south, has a dull-yellow head bar and grey body bars. Male and juvenile fish are bright red-orange with white bars.

This distinctive feature meant they were previously considered a separate species. Image:Premnas, Andamán.jpg|Female with striking gold body bars from the Andaman Islands Image:Premnas biaculeatus 1.jpg|Female with gold body bars and dark brown body =Similar species= No similar species are seen because the cheek spine is distinctive of the genus and presently all geographic variations of the fish are considered to be the one species. Genetic analysis has shown that it is closely related to A. percula and A. latezonatus. Distribution and habitat P. biaculeatus is found in the Malay Archipelago and Western Pacific Ocean north of the Great Barrier Reef. =Host anemones= The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure. P. biaculeatus is highly specialised with only one species anemone host, Entacmaea quadricolor bubble-tip anemone, predominantly with the solitary form. The fish chooses the host and one of the primary drivers for host selection is thought to be competition. E. quadricolor is highly generalist, hosting at least 14 species, around half of all species of anemonefish. With such competition, P. biaculeatus is considered to be the most territorial of all anemonefish. Competition alone, though, does not explain the preference of P. biaculeatus for the solitary form of E. quadricolor. Taxonomy P. biaculeatus is currently the only member of the genus Premnas. Historically, anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field, while in a laboratory, other features such as scalation of the head, tooth shape, and body proportions are used. The spine on the cheek of the fish is the characteristic that distinguishes the genus Premnas from the closely related Amphiprion. P. biaculeatus has been thought to have a monospecific lineage, however genetic analysis has shown that it is closely related to A. percula and A. latezonatus. Genetic analysis suggests P. biaculeatus is monophyletic with Amphiprion, closely related to A. ocellaris and A. percula. This would make Premnas a synonym of Amphiprion. The taxon epigrammata from Sumatra probably should be recognized as a distinct species, Premnas epigrammata (Fowler, 1904).Kuiter, R. H., and H. Debelius. 2007 (2nd edition). World Atlas of Marine Fishes. The recent precedents of the recognition of A. barberi as a distinct species from A. melanopus and A. pacificus being distinguished from A. akallopisos demonstrate the need to show not only geographic and morphological differences, but also genetic data to confirm the separation of the proposed species. In the aquarium The fish has successfully bred in a home aquarium. Being one of the larger anemonefish and the most aggressive, these characteristics need to be accommodated in any aquarium setup. =Selective breeding= P. biaculeatus has been subject to selective breeding in captivity. One of the more prominent traits is the \\"lightning\\" morph which is characterized by broken, jagged white body bars that have a honeycomb appearance. One of the first times this trait was observed was in a wild-caught pair from Fisherman's Island near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. =Hybridization= The maroon clownfish has been successfully crossbred with A. ocellaris to create the hybrid named the \\"blood orange clownfish\\" by the Florida aquaculture company, Oceans, Reefs and Aquariums. The body of this hybrid more closely resembles A. ocellaris, but possesses a darker orange hue, grows larger, and has a more fiery temperament, features characteristic of its P. biaculeatus genes.

He was the head football coach at the University of South Dakota, his alma mater, from 2012 to 2015. He was named head coach on December 5, 2011 after the school's athletic director, David Sayler, fired Ed Meierkort. Glenn served as the head football coach at Doane College (1976–1979), the University of Northern Colorado (1989–1999), the University of Montana (2000–2002), and the University of Wyoming (2003–2008). He won two NCAA Division II Football Championships at Northern Colorado, in 1996 and 1997, and an NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship at Montana in 2001. Coaching career =Early coaching career= Glenn served as backfield coach at the University of South Dakota in 1974. He was also a backfield coach at Northern Arizona University in 1975. Glenn's first head coaching job was at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. There he was the youngest head college football coach at 27 years of age. While at Doane he compiled a 21–18–1 record over four seasons. After Doane, Glenn made his first stint at the University of Montana as a quarterbacks and wide receivers coach and offensive coordinator from 1980 to 1985. He was out of coaching in 1986. In 1987, he joined the staff at University of Northern Colorado (UNC) as quarterbacks and kicking coach. He was named head coach of UNC for the 1989 season. Prior to coaching at Montana, Glenn led the Division II University of Northern Colorado to two NCAA Division II Football Championships in 1996 and 1997. Glenn spent eleven seasons at UNC, with a 98–35 record. =Montana= Glenn coached at Montana for three seasons, from 2000 to 2002, and compiled a 39–6 record. In 2001, the Grizzlies won the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship, defeating Furman in the title game. The year before, the Grizzlies finished as the NCAA Division I-AA runner-up, losing to Georgia Southern in the championship game. In 2002, Montana finished in the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs. =Wyoming= Over a three-year period, Glenn and his staff took a team that won only five games in the three previous seasons to a Las Vegas Bowl win in two seasons. The 24–21 victory over UCLA on December 23, 2004 marked the first bowl appearance for Wyoming in 11 years and their first bowl victory in 38 years. In 2005, after starting 4–1, including a victory over the Ole Miss, the Cowboys went on a six-game losing skid, finishing 4–7. The 2006 season was one which saw the Cowboys picked to finish last in the conference. After an opening day victory over Utah State, the Cowboys suffered four heartbreaking losses, two of them in overtime. Then the Cowboys fortunes began to shift. The team enjoyed a four-game winning streak, all against conference opponents. The Cowboys next two games were both embarrassing road losses, the first against TCU, in which they managed only a field goal. The next game was on the road against than #25 BYU. The Cougars trounced the Cowboys, 55–7. The Cowboys fell to 5–6. The Cowboys won their final game against UNLV, moving them to a 6–6 record, and making them bowl eligible but the team did not receive an invitation. The 2007 Cowboys season started off with a 23–3 victory over Atlantic Coast Conference-member Virginia. By the end of October, Wyoming was 5–3 and needed only one win in its last four games to become bowl-eligible. However, the Cowboys lost all four games to finish 5–7, including a 50–0 thrashing at the hands of Utah on November 10. The 2008 season began with the unspoken mandate to get Wyoming bowl-eligible. Offensive coordinator Billy Cockhill was fired at the end of the 2007 season and replaced by Bob Cole, formerly of Florida A&M; in an attempt to improve the Cowboy's anemic offense. Junior college signal caller Dax Crum came to the Laramie campus from the Mesa Community College in Arizona to compete for the starting quarterback job, which he won over junior Karsten Sween. The 2008 Cowboys opened the season with a win over Mid-American Conference-member 2008 Ohio Bobcats football team (21-20), a loss to Air Force (23-3) and a win over FCS North Dakota State (16–13). Wyoming followed up that victory with five straight losses: to BYU (44–0), Bowling Green (45–16), New Mexico (24–0), Utah (40-7), and TCU (54–7). On November 1, the Pokes beat hapless San Diego State, 35-10, at home and then followed with a historic win over Tennessee, 13–7, on the road a week later. Five days later, on Thursday, Wyoming lost to UNLV, 22–14, on the road. Wyoming finished the season by losing to arch rival Colorado State, 31–20, at home in the 100th Border War. The following day, November 23, 2008, Glenn was fired. Glenn finished his career at Wyoming with an overall record of 30–41 (.423), and 15–31 (.326) versus Mountain West opponents. Glenn joined the Mtn. as a game-day analyst in 2009. In 2010, he left the Mtn. and joined the WAC Sports Network as a color commentator. =South Dakota= Glenn was named USD's 29th head football coach on December 5, 2011. Glenn started coaching the Coyotes during the 2012 season as they started their first season as a full-fledged member in Division I-FCS football, competing in the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Controversy During the week before their game against Utah in 2007, Glenn \\"guaranteed\\" a victory at a luncheon for University of Wyoming students. However, this ended up motivating Utah as they beat Wyoming that day, 50-0. In the third quarter, with the Utes up 43-0, Utah attempted an onside kick. After the play, a furious Glenn was caught giving the middle finger in the direction of the Utah sidelines on national television. The Mountain West Conference reprimanded Glenn, who would later apologize for the obscene gesture and regretted the \\"guarantee.\\" Utah Head Coach Kyle Whittingham later admitted calling for an onside kick in that situation was a \\"bad decision\\" and regretted the play call. Personal life Glenn graduated from the University of South Dakota in 1971. While there, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in health, physical education, recreation and athletics. He played quarterback and wide receiver for the Coyotes, and was selected a team captain as a senior. During college, he completed Army ROTC and upon graduation was commissioned as a second lieutenant serving two-years of active duty as an MP at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1975, he received a master's degree in education from South Dakota. In 2006, Glenn was inducted into the university's Hall of Fame. Glenn and his wife, Michele, are both natives of Lincoln, Nebraska. They have two adult children: a daughter, Erin, and a son, Casey. Casey was an All-American offensive lineman at Carroll College in Helena, Montana, concluding his playing career in 2002 when Carroll won their first of five NAIA National Championships. After coaching at Idaho State, South Dakota and Oklahoma, he served as tight ends and fullbacks coach after serving as Director of Football Operations for Wyoming under his father.

A band of approximately 300 Shoshone people, the Tukudeka, were known as the Sheepeaters because they ate Bighorn sheep Rocky Mountain sheep akin to other bands of Shoshone who were known by those sacred foods they lived amongst and ate by hunting, fishing, and gathering them, such as: the Agaideka; Salmoneaters, Tukadeka; (Bighorn) Sheepeaters, and different bands across Shoshone homelands.Tukudeka. Hence, because the Tukadeka bands were proficient at huntingTHE SHEEPEATER INDIANS they were known as 'Sheepeaters' as Bighorn Sheep were a main staple of food, clothing, and tools. Background Leading up to the war, European-American settlers accused the Shoshone of stealing horses in Indian Valley and killing three settlers near present-day Cascade, Idaho during the pursuit. In August, the Shoshone were accused of killing two prospectors in an ambush at Pearsall Creek, five miles from Cascade. By February 1879 they were accused of the murders of five Chinese miners at Oro Grande, murders at Loon Creek, and finally the murders of two ranchers in the South Fork of the Salmon River in May. There was no evidence for these accusations. Campaign United States troops were ordered into action based on the settler's complaints. Heading the campaign against the Sheepeaters was Troop G of the 1st Cavalry led by Captain Reuben Bernard, Company C and a detachment of Company K from the 2nd Infantry Regiment under the command of First Lieutenant Henry Catley, and 20 Indian scouts commanded by Lieutenant Edward Farrow of the 21st Infantry. The troops were all heading toward Payette Lake, near present-day McCall. Bernard headed North from Boise barracks, Catley headed South from Camp Howard, and Farrow headed East from the Umatilla Agency. Throughout the campaign, the troops faced difficulty traveling through the rough terrain. The first segment of the campaign, from May 31 to September 8, was through the Salmon River, dubbed the \\"River of No Return\\" because it was barely navigable. By August 20, a Sheepeater raiding party of ten to fifteen Indians attacked the troops as they guarded a pack train at Soldier Bar on Big Creek. Those who defended the pack train included Corporal Charles B. Hardin along with six troopers and the chief packer, James Barnes. They managed to drive the Sheepeaters off with only one casualty, Private Harry Eagan of the 2nd Infantry. By October, the campaign ended once Lieutenants W.C. Brown and Edward S. Farrow, along with a group of twenty Umatilla scouts, negotiated the surrender of the Sheepeaters. See also *List of U.S. military history events *Idaho *Indian Wars Notes References *Parker, Aaron.

Islam in Argentina is represented by one of the largest Muslim minorities. Although accurate statistics on religion are not available (because the national census does not solicit religious data) the actual size of Argentina's Muslim community is estimated around 1% of the total population (400,000 to 500,000 members) according to the International Religious Freedom Report 2010. The Pew Research Centre estimates about 1,000,000 Muslims in Argentina in the year 2010. The Association of Religion Data Archives however approximates that 1.9% of the population profess Islam as their faith.  Early Muslim immigration  There are some indications that the Muslim presence within present day Argentinian territory dates back to the time of the Spanish exploration and conquest. The first mentioned Muslim settlers were the 15th century's Moorish-Morisco (Muslims of the Iberian peninsula of North African, Middle-Eastern and Spanish descent) who explored the Americas with Spanish explorers, many of them settling in Argentina who were fleeing from persecution in Spain such as the Spanish Inquisition.Muslims in American History: A Forgotten Legacy by Jerald Dirks. However, in the 19th century Argentina saw the first real wave of Arabs to settle within its territory, mostly from Syria and Lebanon. It is estimated that today there are about 3.5 million Argentinians of Arab descent, most of whom are Christian.September 2001 Executive Summary, Racial Discrimination: The Record of Argentina, Human Rights Documentation Center Islamic institutions in Argentina The first two mosques in the country were built in Buenos Aires in the 80s: At-Tauhid Mosque was opened in 1983 by the shia community of Buenos Aires and with the support of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Argentina, while Al Ahmad Mosque was opened in 1985 for the sunni Muslims and is the first building with Islamic architecture in the country. There are also several mosques in other cities and regions throughout the country, including two in Córdoba, two in Mar del Plata and the southernmost Sufi mosque in the world, in El Bolsón. The King Fahd Islamic Cultural Centre, the largest mosque in Argentina, was completed in 1996 with the help of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the then King of Saudi Arabia, Fahd, on a piece of land measuring 20,000 m². The total land area granted by the Argentine government measures 34,000 m², and was offered by President Carlos Menem following his visit to Saudi Arabia in 1992. The project cost around US$30 million, and includes a mosque, library, two schools, a park, is located in the middle- class district of Palermo, Buenos Aires.

Jimmy George is a Canadian folk rock band from Ottawa, Canada, who combine Celtic folk with rock influences and formed in 1991. History The line-up through the majority of the Duke of Somerset years, recording of both albums and all videos was Eric Altman (drums, management), Joel Carlson (mandolin), Michael Eady (fiddle), Steve Donnelly (bass), Jeff Kerr (banjo), Michael \\"Spike\\" Lawson (guitar), J Todd (main vocals, acoustic guitar) and Mickey Vallee (accordion). While Todd took the majority of singing duties, other members sang harmonies and most sang lead on a song or two. The original, short-lived lineup consisted of Michael Lawson (electric guitar), Joel Carlson (mandolin), Steve Barry (vocals), Duncan Gillis (acoustic guitar/penny whistle), Rob Porter (drums), Michael Eady (fiddle) and Colin Burns (bass). At the end of their nine-year run as house band at the Duke of Somerset pub, the band consisted of J Todd, electric guitarist Steve Donnelly, bassist George Jennings, Joel Carlson on mandolin, Jeff Kerr on banjo, Mickey Vallee on accordion, and Tom Werbowetski on drums. Other members at various times included Christine Chesser (fiddle, vocals, 1991-1992), and Vitas Paukstitis (bass, 1991). In 1993, the band was asked to open for Spirit of the West in Peterborough and at Carleton University's Porter Hall in Ottawa. Bill Stunt, producer of CBC Radio's All In A Day program, was at the show in Ottawa and approached the band afterwards, offering to record the band's material using funding from the CBC development budget. Recording took place over the next few months at Ottawa's Sound of One Hand studio, and the album A Month of Sundays was released on Montreal's now-defunct Cargo Records later that year, with national distribution by MCA Records. Two years later the band released their follow-up record Hotel Motel, produced by Marty Jones (Furnaceface), and recorded at Sound of One Hand and Raven Street Studios. The band toured Canada twice and also played occasional shows in the United States. Most of the band also visited England and Ireland in July, 1992, busking in the streets of London and Dublin including Temple Bar. Jimmy George was the house band at the basement Duke of Somerset pub in downtown Ottawa for a nine-year period, playing every Sunday night and one Thursday-Saturday weekend a month, sometimes playing the \\"Duke\\" up to 10 times in a month, as well as other shows around town. They played over 500 shows at the pub which was usually packed with revellers, including several St. Patrick's Days and New Year's Eves. As the Duke of Somerset underwent renovations and crowds thinned, the band ceased recording and playing, playing a \\"final\\" show in 1997. They played regular \\"reunion\\" shows in Ottawa to celebrate St. Patrick's Day or over the Christmas holidays for several years. In 2001, on the occasion of a reunion show at Barrymore's Music Hall in Ottawa, the band released the CD Same Sh!t Different Day, a collection of songs from their previous releases, plus some live recordings including the previously unreleased song \\"Where You Bleed\\". In April 2002, the band headlined Ottawa's Tulip Festival Concert Series and played a headline show at Ottawa's Barrymore's Music Hall. On October 7, 2007, the former owners and staff of the Duke of Somerset pub organized a reunion event at local pub The Heart and Crown. Jimmy George played two sets with the line-up of J (vocals/acoustic guitar), Jeff (banjo), Mike (electric guitar), Joel (mandolin/bass), Rob (drums), Steve (bass/mandolin/accordion) and guest appearances by Angela McFall (Fairytale of New York) and Madeleine Giguere (Rock and Roll Thing) on vocals and Colin Burns on bass for a few songs. On March 17, 2008, the band played a St. Patrick's Day show at Zaphod Beeblebrox in Ottawa. The lineup for this show consisted of J Todd (vocals, acoustic guitar), Joel Carlson (mandolin), Rob Porter (drums), Steve Donnelly (bass, electric guitar, accordion) and Colin Burns (bass on a few songs). In December 2011 the band celebrated their 20th anniversary with 3 shows at Kaffe 1870 (Wakefield, QC) and Elmdale House Tavern (Ottawa, ON). Altman flew in from Japan and Vallee returned from Alberta for the occasion. The band played to capacity audiences for three nights; the second night featured all three drummers from the band's history, Altman, founding member Rob Porter and Tom Werbowetski. The band has since played occasional St. Patrick's Day shows at House of Targ in Ottawa. In 2018 the band also played the Grey Cup festivities in Ottawa in Aberdeen Pavilion at Lansdowne Park. The members continue to perform in bands including Bible All-Stars (Carlson); The Kingmakers, Ray Harris, Sean Oliver, KJ Thomas bands (Donnelly); Mike McDonald Broadband (Vallee). Several of the band's songs have been performed by other bands, including \\"Breakfast With St. Swithin\\", which appeared on Vancouver band The Town Pants' CD. Other bands have performed the band's \\"Token Celtic Drinking Song\\". Their songs have been featured in several television programs including MTV Live, American Restoration, Toddlers and Tiaras, The Willis Family, Southbound, Still Standing and Southie Rules. TV appearances 2005 Rita and Friends CBC TV The band has made several TV appearances, including The Tom Green Show, Rita & Friends (CBC), and Lunch TV (CITY TV Toronto). Festivals The band played at festivals including Northern Lights (Sudbury), Ottawa Folk Festival (Ottawa), Tulip Festival (Ottawa), Mariposa (Toronto), Music West (Vancouver), North By Northeast (NXNE) (Toronto), Canadian Music Week (Toronto) and Riverfest (Deep River).

The New Frontiers program is a series of space exploration missions being conducted by NASA with the purpose of furthering our understanding of the Solar System. The program selects medium-class missions which can provide high science returns. NASA is encouraging both domestic and international scientists to submit mission proposals for the program. New Frontiers was built on the innovative approach used by the Discovery and Explorer Programs of principal investigator-led missions. It is designed for medium-class missions that cannot be accomplished within the cost and time constraints of Discovery, but are not as large as Large Strategic Science Missions (Flagship missions). There are currently three New Frontiers missions in progress and one in development. New Horizons, which was launched in 2006 and reached Pluto in 2015, Juno, which was launched in 2011 and entered Jupiter orbit in 2016, and OSIRIS-REx, launched in September 2016 towards asteroid Bennu for detailed studies from 2018 to 2021 and a sample return to Earth in 2023. On June 27, 2019, Dragonfly was selected to become the fourth mission in the New Frontiers program.  History  Juno views Earth in October 2013 during the spacecraft's flyby en route to Jupiter The New Frontiers program was developed and advocated by NASA and granted by Congress in CY 2002 and 2003. This effort was led by two long-time NASA executives at headquarters at that time: Edward Weiler, Associate Administrator of Science, and Colleen Hartman, Solar System Exploration Division Director. The mission to Pluto had already been selected before this program was successfully endorsed and funded, so the mission to Pluto, called New Horizons, was \\"grandfathered\\" into the New Frontiers program. The 2003 Planetary Science Decadal Survey from the National Academy of Sciences identified destinations that then served as the source of the first competition for the New Frontiers program. The program name was selected by Hartman based on President John F. Kennedy's speech in 1960, in which he said \\"We stand, today, on the edge of a New Frontier.\\" Examples of proposed mission concepts include two broad groups based on Planetary Science Decadal Survey goals.nasa nf * From New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated Exploration Strategy ** Kuiper Belt Pluto Explorer (realized in New Horizons) ** Jupiter Polar Orbiter with Probes (led to Juno) ** Venus In Situ Explorer ** Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return Mission ** Comet Surface Sample Return Mission: Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return (CAESAR) (see also the similar OSIRIS-REx, which is planned for a near-Earth object, not a comet.) * From Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013–2022 ** Io Volcano Observer ** Lunar Geophysical Network ** Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe ** Trojan Tour and Rendezvous  Missions in progress  = New Horizons (New Frontiers 1) = New Horizons, a mission to Pluto, was launched on January 19, 2006. After a Jupiter gravity assist in February 2007 the spacecraft continued towards Pluto. The primary mission flyby occurred in July 2015 and the spacecraft was then targeted toward one Kuiper Belt object called 486958 Arrokoth for a January 1, 2019 flyby. Another mission that was considered with this mission was New Horizons 2. = Juno (New Frontiers 2) = Artists's concept of Juno at Jupiter Juno is a Jupiter exploration mission which launched on August 5, 2011 and arrived in July 2016. It is the first solar-powered spacecraft to explore an outer planet. The craft was placed into a polar orbit in order to study the planet's magnetic field and internal structure. NASA's Galileo mission to Jupiter provided extensive knowledge about its upper atmosphere, however, further study of Jupiter is crucial not only to the understanding of its origin and nature of the Solar System, but also of giant extrasolar planets in general. The Juno spacecraft investigation is intended to address the following objectives for Jupiter: * Understand Jupiter's gross dynamical and structural properties through determination of the mass and size of Jupiter's core, its gravitational and magnetic fields, and internal convection; * Measure the Jovian atmospheric composition, particularly the condensable-gas abundances (H2O, NH3, CH4 and H2S), the Jovian atmospheric temperature profile, wind velocity profile, and cloud opacity to greater depths than achieved by the Galileo entry probe with a goal of 100 bar at multiple latitudes; and * Investigate and characterize the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere. = OSIRIS- REx (New Frontiers 3) = Mission logo OSIRIS-REx stands for \\"Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer\\", and was launched on 8 September 2016. This mission plan is to orbit an asteroid, at the time named (now 101955 Bennu), by 2020. After extensive measurements, the spacecraft will collect a sample from the asteroid's surface for return to Earth in 2023. The mission, excluding the launch vehicle, is expected to cost approximately $800 million. The returned sample will help scientists answer long-held questions about the formation of the Solar System and the origin of complex organic molecules necessary for the origin of life. Asteroid Bennu is a potential future Earth impactor and is listed on the Sentry Risk Table with the third highest rating on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale (circa 2015). In the late 2100s there is a cumulative chance of about 0.07% it could strike Earth, therefore there is a need to measure the composition and Yarkovsky effect of the asteroid.  Planned missions  = Dragonfly (New Frontiers 4) = Titan Dragonfly will send a mobile robotic rotorcraft to Saturn's biggest moon Titan and will make use of Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTG) for power to navigate through the atmosphere of Titan.New Frontiers fourth announcement of opportunity.

The 2018 Midterm Review of the 2013–2022 Decadal Survey found that NASA is falling behind on this cadence, and recommends the release of the New Frontiers 5 Announcement of Opportunity no later than December 2021. Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, responded positively to the Midterm Review's recommendation, stating that NASA is \\"committed to conducting two New Frontiers competitions per decade\\" and currently plans to release the Announcement of Opportunity in 2021 or 2022, though the Midterm Review estimates a release date as late as 2023. The Decadal Survey recommended the Io Observer and Lunar Geophysical Network proposals for New Frontiers 5, in addition to the previous recommendations. As of January 2020, NASA plans to release the New Frontiers 5 Announcement of Opportunity in late 2022.

Description The sebae anemone is characterized by a flared oral disc which reaches between 20 and 50 cm in diameter and with multiple and long tentacles measuring 10 to 15 cm. These tentacles have rounded tip and the end is often colored with a purple or blue spot. The column, external structure of an anemone visible when the animal is closed, is gray in color and dotted with sticky whitish \\"warts\\". The sea anemone, being member of the Hexacorallia, usually carries a number of tentacles multiple of six and they are positioned in concentric circles. These are light beige to purple. Distribution and habitat The sebae anemone is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific area from the eastern coasts of Africa, Red Sea included, to Polynesia and from south Japan to Australia and New- Caledonia. This sea anemone prefers hard base substrates slightly covered with sand but it can also cling to branching corals from the surface to 40 meters deep.Gosliner T.M., Behrens D.W., Williams G.C., 1996, CORAL REEF ANIMALS OF THE INDO-PACIFIC, ed. Sea Challengers, Monterey, California, 314p. Biology The sebae anemone has two ways to feed. The first one is through the inside via photosynthesis of its symbiotic hosts zooxanthellae, living in its tissues. And the second one is through a normal way by capturing its preys via its tentacles that allow it to immobilize its prey (small invertebrates, fry, or juvenile fish). Its reproduction can be sexual by simultaneous transmission of male and female gametes in the water or asexual by scissiparity; the anemone divides itself into two separate individuals from the foot or the mouth. The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is highly nested in structure. With 15 species of hosted anemonefish, the sebae anemone is highly generalist, and mostly hosts generalist anemonefish. A. latezonatus, the wide-band anemonefish, is a specialist only hosted by H. crispa.. In the Red Sea, it is considered a nursery anemone as sexually mature fish are rarely hosted by H. crispa. A study in the northern Red Sea found anemone density affected whether H. crispa hosted anemonefish, with clusters of juvenile fish only found at low-density sites, while either one or no juvenile anemonefish were found in H. crispa at the high-density site. The authors theorised that H. crispa was a nursery anemone due to being unable to adequately protect adult anemonefish from predation, active emigration of fish to Entacmaea quadricolor and/or environmentally controlled cessation of fish growth. Why this would be so in the Red Sea is not clear, when in the western Pacific, adult pairs are found in individuals of H. crispa. The anemone fish hosted by the sebae anemone are: *Amphiprion akindynos (Barrier Reef anemonefish) *A. barberi (Barber's anemonefish) *A. bicinctus (two-band anemonefish) *A. chrysopterus (orange-fin anemonefish) *A. clarkii (Clark's anemonefish) *A. ephippium (red saddleback anemonefish) *A. latezonatus (wide- band anemonefish) *A. leucokranos (white-bonnet anemonefish) *A. melanopus (red and black anemonefish) *A. omanensis (Oman anemonefish) *A. percula (clown anemonefish) *A. perideraion (pink skunk anemonefish) *A. polymnus (saddleback anemonefish) *A. sandaracinos (orange anemonefish) * A. thiellei *A. tricinctus (three-band anemonefish) Juveniles of Dascyllus trimaculatus are also associated with H. crispa.

Equations  The following equations are used for an x-bar-control chart: :\\\\bar x = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n :\\\\sigma_{\\\\bar x} = \\\\sigma/\\\\sqrt n In the example, with n = 10 samples, the targeted mean, \\\\bar x, and standard error of the mean, \\\\sigma_{\\\\bar x} are: :\\\\bar x = 1 :\\\\sigma_{\\\\bar x} = 0.1/\\\\sqrt 10 = 0.0316 That is, independent 10-sample means should themselves have a standard deviation of 0.0316. It is natural that the means vary this much, for by the central limit theorem the means should have a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the samples themselves. The importance of knowing the natural process variation becomes clear when we apply statistical process control. In a stable process, the mean is on target; in the example, the target is the filling, set to 1 litre. The variation within the upper and lower control limits (UCL and LCL) is considered the natural variation of the process.  Usage  When a sample average (size n = 10 in this case) is located outside the control limits, then this is an indication that the process is out of (statistical) control. To be more specific: :The Western Electric rules conclude that the process is out of control if: :# One point plots outside the 3σ-limits (the UCL and LCL). :# Two out of three consecutive points plot beyond a 2σ-limit. :# Four out of five consecutive points plot at a distance of 1σ or beyond from the centerline. :# Eight consecutive points plot on one side of the center line.  Goal  The most important goal of understanding the principle of natural process variation is to consider the natural variance in the output before we make any changes to the process. Since SPC tends to minimize the process variations in time, as we better understand the process and have more experience with running it, we try to reduce the variation of it. The knowledge of the principle of natural variance helps us avoid making any unnecessary changes to the process, which might add variance to the process, instead of removing it.

It is now part of the University of Sheffield and is a lecture theatre and student housing. St George's is the first of three Commissioners' churches to have been built in Sheffield under the Church Building Act 1818. The other two are St Mary's Church, Bramall Lane and St Philip's Church, Netherthorpe (demolished 1951). St George's is a Gothic Revival building designed by the architects Woodhead and Hurst in a Perpendicular Gothic style. It was built at a cost of £15,181 (), the whole cost being met by the Church Building Commission. The building is long and wide, and consisted of a flat-ceilinged nave with six bays, a single-bay chancel, and a -high tower. Galleries extended the length of the north and south walls, and there was a two-tiered gallery on the west wall. In total the church could seat 380 people. The foundation stone was laid on 19 July 1821, and the church was consecrated by Archbishop Vernon Harcourt on 29 June 1825. Interior now a lecture theatre The church was declared redundant and closed in 1981. It stood unused for a number of years until the University of Sheffield acquired it and in 1994 had it converted into a lecture theatre and student accommodation. Prior to this it had been the last of the Commissioners' churches in Sheffield to retain its original form. It is a Grade II listed building. In 2010 a nest-box was placed on the church rooftop, which is now home to a breeding pair of peregrine falcons that can be seen via live stream webcam.

Spread over , it is located about north of the city near the suburb of Devanahalli. It is owned and operated by Bengaluru International Airport Limited (BIAL), a public–private consortium. The airport opened in May 2008 as an alternative to increased congestion at HAL Airport, the original primary commercial airport serving the city. It is named after Kempe Gowda I, the founder of Bangalore. Kempegowda International Airport became Karnataka's first fully solar powered airport developed by CleanMax Solar. Kempegowda Airport is the third-busiest airport by passenger traffic in the country, behind the airports in Delhi and Mumbai, and is the 29th busiest airport in Asia. It handled around 33.30 million passengers in the calendar year 2018 with 658 aircraft movements a day. The cargo handled by the airport continues to increase steadily, with the airport handling about of cargo between April 2018 and March 2019. The airport consists of two runways and a passenger terminal, which handles both domestic and international operations. The second runway, constructed by Larsen & Toubro, was commissioned on 6 December 2019. A second terminal is in the early stages of construction. Also, there is a cargo village and three cargo terminals. The airport serves as a hub for AirAsia India, Alliance Air, and IndiGo and is a focus city for Air India and SpiceJet.  History  =Planning (1991–2004)= The original airport serving Bangalore was HAL Airport, located from the city centre. However, as Bangalore grew into the Silicon Valley of India and passenger traffic to the city rose, the airport was unable to cope. There was no room for expansion and the airport apron could only park six aircraft. In March 1991, former chairman of the National Airports Authority of India (NAAI) S. Ramanathan convened a panel to select the site for a new airport. The panel decided on Devanahalli, a village about north of Bangalore. The State Government made a proposal to build the airport with private assistance, which the Union Government approved in 1994. In December 1995, a consortium consisting of Tata Group, Raytheon and Singapore Changi Airport signed a memorandum of understanding with the State Government regarding participation in the project. In June 1998, however, the consortium announced it was pulling out of the project due to delays in government approval. These included disputes over the location of the airport and the fate of HAL Airport. In May 1999, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (KSIIDC) of the State Government signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the nature of the project. It would be a public–private partnership, with AAI and KSIIDC having a 26% share and private companies having the remaining 74%. In January 2001, the State Government created the company Bengaluru International Airport Limited (BIAL) as a special purpose entity and began searching for partners. By November, the project had attracted Unique Zürich Airport, Siemens Project Ventures and Larsen & Toubro. Construction was expected to begin in October 2002; however, governmental delays persisted. The concession agreement between the State Government, the Union Government and BIAL was signed in July 2004. In it, BIAL required the closure of HAL Airport. =Construction and opening (2005–2008)= Construction finally commenced on 2 July 2005. When a study predicted the airport would receive 6.7 million passengers in 2008, the airport was redesigned from its initial capacity of 4.5 million passengers to 11 million, with the terminal size expanded and the number of aircraft stands increased. The cost of the airport rose to . Construction was completed in 32 months, and BIAL set the launch date for 30 March 2008. However, due to delays in establishing air traffic control services at the airport, the launch date was pushed to 11 May and finally 24 May 2008. As the opening date for the airport approached, public criticism arose, mainly directed toward the closure of HAL Airport. In March 2008, AAI employees conducted a massive strike against the closure of HAL Airport along with Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad, fearing they would lose their jobs. The Bangalore City Connect Foundation, a group of citizens and businessmen, staged a rally in mid-May, claiming the new airport was too small for the latest demand projections. On 23 May, a hearing was held at the Karnataka High Court over poor connectivity between the city and the airport. Ultimately, the State Government decided to go ahead with inaugurating the new airport and closing HAL Airport. The first flight to the airport, Air India Flight 609 from Mumbai, was allowed to land the previous night as it would be continuing to Singapore shortly after midnight. The aircraft touched down at 10:40 pm on 23 May. The airport became the third greenfield airport under a public–private partnership to open in India, after Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad and Cochin International Airport. =Renaming and expansion (2009–present)= The original name of the airport was Bangalore International Airport. In February 2009, the State Government sent a proposal to the Union Government to rename the airport after the founder of Bangalore, Kempe Gowda I. When no action was taken, the State Government passed a resolution for the name change in December 2011. The Union Government accepted the proposal in 2012 and formally approved it in July 2013. The airport was officially renamed Kempegowda International Airport on 14 December 2013 amid the inauguration of the expanded terminal building. Kingfisher Airlines once operated a hub and was one of the largest airlines at Kempegowda Airport. Following its collapse in October 2012, other airlines stepped in to fill the gap in domestic connectivity by adding more flights. In addition, Air Pegasus and AirAsia India launched hub operations at the airport in 2014. The first phase of expansion was launched in June 2011 and finished in December 2013. The project doubled the size of the passenger terminal to , involving the construction of additional facilities for check-in, immigration, security and baggage reclaim. One domestic gate and three international gates were added as well. A large, sweeping roof connects the original building with the expanded areas. The expanded terminal, dubbed \\"Terminal 1A\\", has raised the annual passenger capacity of the airport to 25 million.  Ownership  The airport is owned and operated by Bengaluru International Airport Limited (BIAL), a public limited company. The Government of India has granted BIAL the right to operate the airport for 30 years, with the option to continue for another 30 years. The company is a public–private consortium venture. 26% is held by government entities Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation (13%) and Airports Authority of India (13%), and 74% is held by private companies Fairfax Financial (54%) and Siemens Project Ventures (20%).http://www.freepressjournal.in/business/gvk-exits-bluru- airport-sells-residual-10-stake-to-fairfax/1102576 https://s1.q4cdn.com/293822657/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/2018/Website- Fairfax-India-2018-Shareholders-Letter.pdf Facilities Duty Free =Runways= Kempegowda International Airport has two runways in use. * Runway 09L/27R: , CAT I, ILS equipped. *Runway 09R/27L: , CAT III, ILS equipped. Four years after it was laid, the runway was entirely resurfaced because of a serious decline in quality. From 11 March to 3 April 2012, it was closed daily between 10:30 am and 5:30 pm. As a result, BIAL accused construction company Larsen & Toubro of building the runway poorly. South of runway 09/27 are a full-length parallel taxiway and the apron, which extends from the Blue Dart/DHL terminal to the passenger terminal. The second runway has completed construction at the airport, and was officially in use from 6 December 2019, when an Indigo airlines flight (6E 466) to Hyderabad took off from runway 09R. The new runway is however under limited operations until Mar 2020. The runway will cater to all types of aircraft including Code-F aircraft like Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 and will be equipped with CAT IIIB ILS. The runway will also feature an associated parallel taxiway and two cross-field taxiways on the east linking the new runway to the existing north runway and the aprons at Terminal 1 and the upcoming Terminal 2. The existing runway will also be upgraded as part of the expansion work. It was announced in February 2020 that the old runway (Runway 09L/27R) will be closed for seven months (26 March 2020 To 4 November 2020) for installing CAT-IIIB ILS landing systems for guiding pilots to safely land at the airport in poor or low visibility conditions. =Terminals = International Departures section at Kempegowda International Airport A single integrated passenger terminal accommodates both domestic and international operations. It covers and can handle 20 million passengers annually. Check-in and baggage reclaim are situated on the lower floor, while departure gates are located on the first floor. Gates 1, 2, 12–18, 28–30 on the first floor are used for domestic departures, gates 31–42 on the first floor are used for international departures, gates 3–9 and gates 19–25 form the Western and Eastern bus gates respectively. Gate 41–42 is equipped to serve the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. Lounges are provided by Above Ground Level and Plaza Premium Lounge, which also operates a day hotel in the terminal. For VIPs there is a separate lounge. =Expansion= Under the second phase of the airport's expansion, a new terminal called Terminal 2 is being built. The new terminal has been designed by renowned architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and is being built by Larsen & Toubro. Phase 1 of the new terminal is expected to be ready by 2021 and will cater to an additional 20 million passengers. Menzies Aviation Bobba and AISATS cargo terminals viewed from the road to the airport =Aviation fuel services= The airport has a fuel farm, spread over west of the cargo village and passenger terminal. It was built by IndianOil SkyTanking Ltd (IOSL) but is shared by multiple oil companies. In October 2008, Indian Oil commissioned a fuel pipeline between its storage terminal in Devanagonthi and Kempegowda Airport. Previously, jet fuel had to be transported to the airport by tank trucks, which created traffic and pollution problems. =Cargo facilities= Kempegowda Airport has three cargo terminals. One is operated by Menzies Aviation Bobba Pvt Ltd and has a capacity for of cargo; it includes a facility for storing pharmaceuticals. Air India SATS (AISATS) operates one terminal, which can handle of cargo. AISATS is also constructing the AISATS Coolport, which will be able to hold of perishable goods. Lastly, DHL and Blue Dart Aviation jointly operate a terminal. BIAL inaugurated a separate cargo village in December 2008. The village is spread over and includes office space, conference rooms, a cafeteria for staff and parking space for nearly 80 trucks. It did not open for occupation until 2010 and initially suffered low occupancy, which some cargo agents attributed to the opening delay, high rent and limited infrastructure. Future plans The second phase of expansion is underway, which encompasses the construction of a second runway and passenger terminal. When complete, Kempegowda Airport will be able to handle 55 million passengers per year. The estimated project received clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests in September 2014. Ground work on the second runway began in February 2016 and the runway opened in December 2019. Located south of the original terminal, it is parallel to runway 09/27 and measures , wider than the original runway so it can accommodate larger aircraft. The new runway is also CAT III certified, allowing for landings in fog and other low visibility conditions. A second terminal will be constructed to cater to the airport's growth. Terminal 2 has been designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The contract to construct Terminal 2 has also been awarded to Larsen & Toubro which will be constructed in two phases. In the first phase, the terminal will cater to 25 million passengers annually. Terminal 2 is estimated to cost . A third runway, north of the current runway is being planned to cater to the growth of air traffic in the airport which will be situated 1500 meters north of the current runway. Dubbed as the \\"New North Parallel Runway,\\", the officials hope to ease air traffic congestion with the third runway. IndiGo announced in January 2019, its plan to build a second maintenance repair and overhaul facility at the airport, which is expected to be operational by March 2020.  Airlines and destinations  = Passenger = =Cargo= The following cargo airlines fly to the airport: * Blue Dart Aviation * Cathay Pacific Cargo * DHL Aviation operated by AeroLogic * Ethiopian Airlines Cargo * Etihad Cargo * FedEx Express * Lufthansa Cargo * MASKargo * Qatar Airways Cargo * Quikjet Cargo * Singapore Airlines Cargo *SpiceXpress * Turkish Airlines Cargo  Connectivity  The trumpet interchange between NH 7 and the road leading from Kempegowda Airport BMTC Volvo buses connecting the city to the airport = Road = Kempegowda Airport is connected to the city of Bangalore by National Highway 44 (NH 44). In January 2014, a six-lane flyover was completed over NH 44 between Hebbal and the airport, helping to reduce travel time to and from the city. Two alternative routes are under construction and will be completed by March 2017, one through Thanisandra and the other through Hennur. The airport car park is located at ground level and can hold 2,000 vehicles. The airport is served by several taxi and rental car companies. In addition, ride-sharing companies Ola Cabs and Uber have their own pick-up zones outside the terminal. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) provides bus transportation to major parts of the city through the Vayu Vajra (Kannada for \\"Diamond in the Air\\") service. It is operated using a fleet of Volvo B7RLE buses. In addition, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operates a nonstop bus service called \\"Flybus\\" between Kempegowda Airport and Mysore, as well as a route to Manipal via Mangalore. = Rail = A Namma Metro link between Bangalore city and the airport is planned with two stations at the airport. A high-speed rail link was previously considered and went as far as obtaining approval from the Union Government. However, the project was eventually scrapped because of high costs and the lack of stops along the line. Construction for a halt at the KIA boundary will be completed by February 2020. The train halt will be connected to the airport terminal via short five- minute shuttle busses. On day One of the service, four trains from the city towards Devanahalli will stop at the KIA halt and four trains heading back. Future plans include hyper electrification of the route to introduce comfortable MEMU trains to the airport. Besides, MEMU trains from Mysore that terminate at Yelahanka could be extended up to Devanahalli via the KIA halt station, benefitting airport-bound passengers from Mysore, Ramanagaram and Bidadi.

It is named after Glendalough in Ireland. The park was once used as a resort and game farm by the owners of Cowles Media Company, owner of what is today the Star Tribune newspaper. The park contains on land and on the water. Cowles Media Company transferred title to Glendalough to the Nature Conservancy in 1990, and the Nature Conservancy transferred title to the State of Minnesota in 1992. Glendalough was officially declared a state park with a celebration on Earth Day, April 22, 1992.  History  In 1903, Ezra G. Valentine developed that land into a summer retreat called Valentine's Camp. In 1905 the park was left to Valentine's children, John Alden and Miss Blanche, who later sold the land to Fred A. Everts. Everts sold the Valentine camp to F.E. Murphy who owned and operated the Minneapolis Tribune. Murphy renamed the land Glendalough, after a monastery in Ireland. With the depression in the 1930s and land becoming available for purchase, Murphy expanded the camp and started a game farm. In 1941, Glendalough, along with the Minneapolis Tribune, was purchased by Cowles Media Company, which was partially owned by John Cowles, Sr. Glendalough Game Farm hosted important individuals such as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Richard Nixon and Vice President Walter Mondale during its time. On Earth Day in 1990, the land was donated to The Nature Conservancy by Cowles Media Company, and in 1992 the title was transferred to the State of Minnesota. While that transfer took place in June,https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00167#information celebrations of the park's anniversary are held around Earth Day.https://www.fergusfallsjournal.com/2016/04/glendalough-state-park- holding-25th-anniversary-celebration/ =2004 and 2005 blowdown= In August 2004, a severe thunderstorm with straight-line winds came through the area, causing severe damage to the landscape. As a result of this devastating incident, the park was closed to the public for a week to clean up debris left by the storm. Less than ten months later, in 2005, Glendalough State Park was hit by another thunderstorm resulting in damage. Following the 2005 storm, the state park was able to remain open with aid from the staff and volunteers of the park. The staff and volunteers used signs and notices warning park visitors of hazards of down trees throughout the park.  Recreation  Glendalough State Park has many forms of recreation facilities that are provided to park visitors, including fishing, camping, hiking, birding, picture taking, boating, kayaking and canoeing. The park has a Historic Lodge where former Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, and former Vice President Walter Mondale stayed when they visited Glendalough State Park. While camping at Glendalough State Park, it is highly advised that any food be stored into a food locker that the park provides with the site. The park discourage visitors from storing their food in the tents because the wildlife can easily tear open the tents and get to the food. =Lodging= Glendalough State Park has the historic Glendalough Lodge at the park. The lodge is rented out to parties for tours or family gatherings for enjoyment of Annie Battle Lake. The state park also has the Trail Center near the Glendalough Lodge that is popular to use for family gatherings or weddings as the parks amphitheater is located nearby. =Camping= At Glendalough State Park, there are three sites designated for camping. The west shore of Annie Battle Lake, between south Annie Battle Lake and North of Molly Stark Lake and on the Southeast corner of Annie Battle Lake. =Picnicking and swimming= This is a scene of one of Glendalough State Park's picnic and beach areas.Glendalough offers picnicking and swimming areas, often with solitude. Glendalough has two swimming areas for the visitors: on the north shore of Annie Battle Lake near the historic Lodge and Trail Center, and on the north shore of Molly Stark Lake near the Picnic Shelter. Cart-in site The campsite along the west side of Annie Battle Lake is designated as a cart-in campground. The state park wants the park visitors to have a primitive setting while camping. This location has four cabins; four electric cabins with one of the cabins being designated as handicapped accessible for the park visitors who need these accommodations. Located at this campsite is a modern restroom facility with showers and plumbing for the visitors who want a semi primitive and modern society living along with firewood and an information kiosk for the campers. Group camp There is one group camp site in the state park: along the creek that flows from Molly Stark Lake to Annie Battle Lake. The group camp is designated for more than seven people for a regular site but no more than 45. The group camp is useful for family gatherings, and visitors may enjoy the setting while fishing, canoeing or swimming. Canoe-in campground The canoe-in campsites is one of the primitive settings that Glendalough State Park has to offer. To access this location, park visitors have one of two options. the may either hike/bike to the site and enjoy the land and the wildlife, or take a canoe and paddle across Annie Battle Lake. Annie Battle Lake is not designated as a motor access lake so travel on the lake is quiet and peaceful. Over at the canoe-in sites are three tent sites and two yurts. Glendalough State Park is one of three state parks in Minnesota to have yurts available for campers to stay in. The canoe-in sites offer a rustic feel to the campers as there is no electricity or running water, but there is a hand- pump for water and a vault in the area, along with firewood for the campers. Rustic camping Between Labor Day and Memorial Day, the facility at the main campground shuts down for the season for a more rustic style of living.  Biology and ecology  =Plant life= Glendalough State Park has a few restored acres of land designated as prairie restoration.

Its focus is to eliminate the racial academic achievement gap by improving the lives of those living in African American and Latino communities. By providing mentoring and tutoring services, the Black Star Project insures that students, parents, and community members become productive citizens in their neighborhoods. Jackson says that the reason he wanted to create the Black Star Project was that he saw a need for young people to grow up successfully.  Mission  The Black Star Project's goal is to eliminate the gap between race and education. This gap has been seen as an ongoing problem throughout the history of Chicago. Due to this ongoing problem, This Black Star Program focuses on one on one interactions with students; but also gets parents involved so that they can have positive influences on their children's education. Members of The Black Star Project specifically have seen that the more fathers go out and help, the better the influence is on their child. They aim to connect African American and Latino communities together by providing educational tools for all ages, parent and mentoring programs, school outreach programs, special events, and national initiatives. The ultimate goal for them is to get as many people from the community involved so no one is left behind in this fight for eliminating the racial academic achievement gap.  Programs  The Black Star Project has a selection of diverse programs for both children, parents, and community members. The academic programs that are offered for African American youth, include Saturday University, Math Boot Camp, Private Tutoring, reading academy, and more. There are also parent programs like the Million Father's March, Father's Club and Parent University. The mentoring programs and special events are put in place in order to bring the African American and Latino communities together. Most of the programs are listed on the Black Star Project's official website. A grant will help further the process of promoting leadership and empowering young black males and the programs that are put in place for their use. In the end, the organization hopes to improve the lives of these young black men by focusing on education reform and fair discipline policies. On June. 24th, 2017, Black Star Project started their fourth annual ceremony for black males’ graduation. At a Mass Black Male Graduation and a Transition to Manhood Ceremony, Philip Jackson says, \\"To improve violence in Chicago, the best way to improve our city, is to improve these young men.\\" = Academic Programs = The academic programs include Saturday University, Math Boot Camp, Private Tutoring and a reading academy for youth.

The film is about the scientist Dr. Alfred Morris and his assistant Ted Allison. Morris, who is obsessed with an ancient Mayan life-preserving process to the point of madness, has fallen in love with Allison's girlfriend, the concert singer Isabel Lewis. Morris decides to use Allison for his eternal-life experiments, transforming him into a zombie who slowly recalls his past life, but is unaware of his undead status. The Mad Ghoul was developed at Universal Pictures in February 1943 under the title The Mystery of the Mad Ghoul. It was completed filming in May 1943 for a release on November 12, 1943. Plot Dr. Alfred Morris (Zucco) is curious about the effects of an ancient nerve gas, used by the Mayans during rituals of human dissection to appease their gods. He takes medical student Ted Allison (David Bruce) under his wing to assist him with his experiments in using the gas on modern animals. However, despite Ted's enthusiasm for the success of their effort to revive Morris's dead monkey Choco (who was earlier exposed to the gas and died) by using a fluid from the heart of another creature, Ted also has on his mind his girlfriend Isabel Lewis (Evelyn Ankers), of whom Morris has also become enamored. Later, on the night of the duo's first experiment, Ted brings Isabel to Morris's house, where Morris notices Isabel's discomfort about her relationship with Ted. He confers with Isabel, saying that she does indeed need a man more involved with her love of music, secretly meaning himself. Isabel, however, is afraid of hurting Ted's feelings and getting him to understand what she wants, but Morris promises to take care of the situation himself. Unbeknownst to Isabel, Morris's evil plan involves destroying Ted by exposing him to the lethal Mayan gas the next day, and in effect, making him a mindless ghoul who, like Choco, must continually rely on the fluid of human hearts to survive (obtained by performing cardioectomies on freshly dead persons). This sets Ted and Morris on a grave- robbing spree through several towns where Isabel is also performing on her tour. Morris tries to get Ted to return home, but Ted is committed to being with Isabel whenever possible, whenever he is not in his unknowing ghoulish state. But, when Ted does become a ghoul again, Morris once more uses him to try to kill off the one person Isabel truly seems to love—Eric Iverson (Turhan Bey), her partner and pianist. Although his attempt is unsuccessful, Ted is able to obtain another heart, keeping himself alive. Eventually the police, aided by ace reporter \\"Scoop\\" McClure (Robert Armstrong), realize that the mysterious \\"ghoul\\"-style killings are on the same route of Isabel's tour. McClure tries to set a trap in Scranton, the last city of Isabel's tour, by making it seem to the public that he is someone else who has recently died, and, by waiting in a coffin for the ghoul, nearly captures Ted and Morris once they arrive to perform another cardioectomy. However, Morris distracts McClure as Ted comes into view and kills him. With Isabel back home, the police attempt to question her about why the killings were made in the same cities she performed in, but even though she claims to know nothing, she thinks for a moment how Ted and Dr. Morris are the only people associated with her that also have a knowledge of how to perform cardioectomies. She later performs for her home crowd, and Morris, in a last attempt to get Isabel for himself, sends Ted to kill \\"First Eric, then myself,\\" as he constantly repeats under his spell. However, before Ted becomes a ghoul, he is able to write a letter to Isabel that explains what happened to him and who did all of the killings. Plus, he exposes Morris to the gas just before he reverts to his ghoul state, and leaves to fulfill Morris's final bidding. Upon entering the stage where Isabel is, he is promptly dispatched by detectives, just as he is about to shoot Eric, who read the note to Isabel that Ted left in his hands. She and Eric hold each other, knowing that Ted always intended the best for them, and that Morris was behind all of the trouble with which Ted and many others were involved. Morris, meanwhile, being drained of nearly all life by the gas, almost succeeds in getting fluid from another heart for himself, but fatally collapses by the grave he is digging up. In the end, words that Ted said earlier to Morris are repeated: \\"It's all over, Doctor. There's nothing left of it now but you, and me, and... death!\\" Cast Still with Evelyn Ankers, Turhan Bey, and David Bruce Cast is sourced from the book Universal Horrors. Production The Mad Ghoul was developed to support Son of Dracula as a double feature. It began development in February 1943 with a script by Paul Gangelin and Brenda Weisberg based on a story by Hans Kraly. It was developed under the title The Mystery of the Mad Ghoul . The director assigned to the film was James Hogan who had just signed to Universal Studios in April after seven years working at Paramount. He died of a heart attack on November 4, 1943, one week before The Mad Ghoul was released. Among the cast was David Bruce who appeared in minor roles in Warner Bros. films in the late 1930s and early 1940s. After a role in Republic films Flying Tigers, he signed on for a three-year contract with Universal. Bruce was cast as the walking corpse of Ted Allison in the film. In the film, his make-up effects by Jack Pierce has degenerative effect to represent a corpse in an accelerated state of decomposition. Bruce recalled that his make-up was green and his hair was made bright red, and applied \\"false skin\\" to him, a process he described as \\"absolute murder\\". Bruce wore the effects for three days and when it was removed it caused him to bleed as they had to peel off the make-up. According to a 1995 interview with Bruce's daughter, he would return home from filming and scaring her mother with his make-up and that Bruce had a very pleasant experience eon the set, specifically getting along very well with George Zucco. Also among the cast was Turhan Bey, who recalled that director Hogan was \\"very matter-of-fact, but an excellent craftsman. And a craftsman was what you had to be when you made B pictures.\\" The film began shooting on May 13, 1943 and finished shooting before the end of May. Initially, Universal had planned for Evelyn Ankers to perform her own songs in the film, but the idea was scrapped at the last moment. Library recordings of Lillian Cornell singing were used as a replacement. Release The Mad Ghoul was distributed theatrically by Universal Pictuers Company on November 12, 1943. It was released for the first time on DVD by Willette Acquisition Corporation on October 7, 2014. Along with Murders in the Zoo, The Mad Doctor of Market Street and The Strange Case of Doctor Rx, The Mad Ghoul was released on blu ray as part of Scream! Factory’s Universal Horror Collection Volume 2 on July 23, 2019. Reception From contemporary reviews, Wanda Hale of The New York Daily News said the film \\"you'll get your creeps and chills in abundance at what George Zucco, making with his evil yes does to corpses and a human being [...] Enough occurs to prevent the chills from leaving you until it's over.\\" Floy Stone of The Motion Picture Herald declared the film as \\"well done, but just that. Zucco's performance is the only one which will command audience attention.\\" Frank Quinn of the New York Daily Mirror found the film was a \\"reash of Frankenstein, while finding the film \\"interesting enough to whet the appetite.\\" John T. McManus declared that along with Captive Wild Woman, Son of Dracula and Phantom of the Opera were \\"unaccountable cinemisdeeds.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called The Mad Ghoul \\"definitely a second-rate ghoul. And if anyone is privileged enough to be crazy, it's us poor folks who have to look at such thing.\\" From retrospective reviews, Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, noting that the strong cast helped buoy the film's grim story.

Since August 2006, he has been General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Career =Early career= While in high school, Gelb began his association with the Metropolitan Opera as an usher. At age 17, Gelb began his career in classical music as office boy to impresario Sol Hurok. Gelb managed the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s 1979 tour to China at the end of the Cultural Revolution. The following year Gelb became Vladimir Horowitz's manager. Gelb assisted the pianist in the revival of his performing career, and managed his return to Russia in 1986. In partnership with the Chinese government, Gelb commissioned the premiere of Tan Dun's Symphony 1997, featuring Yo-Yo Ma, which was performed at the handover of Hong Kong to China. In 1982, Gelb founded, and served as president of, CAMI Video, a division of Columbia Artists Management. In this capacity, he served for six years as executive producer of \\"The Metropolitan Opera Presents\\", the Met's series of televised opera broadcasts. Gelb produced 25 televised productions for the Met, including the 1990 telecast of Richard Wagner’s complete Der Ring des Nibelungen, conducted by James Levine. While at CAMI, Gelb produced and occasionally directed more than 50 programs for television featuring such artists as Herbert von Karajan and Mstislav Rostropovich. In 1992, Gelb produced both the stage and film versions of Julie Taymor’s first opera production, Oedipus Rex, for Seiji Ozawa’s Saito Kinen Festival. Also for that Japanese festival, in 1994 he commissioned an early opera staging by Robert Lepage, La Damnation de Faust. A re-conceived version of that production was later presented at the Met in the 2008–09 season. =Sony Classical= From 1995 until joining the Met, Gelb was president of Sony Classical Records. Gelb pursued a strategy of emphasizing crossover music over mainstream classical repertoire. Examples include cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who was encouraged to record Americana, including an album with fiddler and composer Mark O'Connor and double-bassist and composer Edgar Meyer, Appalachia Waltz; electronic composer Vangelis, who recorded the choral symphony Mythodea; and Charlotte Church, a pop artist who started her career as a classical singer. Gelb expanded the focus of recording projects to include film music, among them the Academy Award-winning scores for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon by Tan Dun, The Red Violin by John Corigliano, and Titanic, by James Horner, while preserving the label’s tradition of recording Broadway musicals and maintaining a catalogue of classical works. Gelb also initiated Sony Classical’s program of commissioning new music. =Metropolitan Opera= Gelb became the 16th General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera, taking over from Joseph Volpe, on August 1, 2006. He launched the beginning of his tenure with several new productions, including Madama Butterfly directed by Anthony Minghella; The Barber of Seville by Bartlett Sher; and of Tan Dun's new opera The First Emperor directed by Zhang Yimou. Gelb launched a number of new ventures for the Met, capitalizing on new media technology to distribute Met performances to a wider global audience. This became The Met: Live in HD series, the Met becoming the first performing arts company to offer live high definition broadcasts of its operas to cinemas and other performing arts centres in many countries of the world. The series gained both a Peabody and an Emmy Award. Several digitally- recorded performances are later offered on public television stations and released on DVDs for purchase. In September 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio (now SiriusXM) launched Metropolitan Opera Radio, broadcasting live performances each week as well as historic performances from the Met’s radio archive. The Met also presents free, live audio streaming of performances from its website once a week. Other initiatives launched by Gelb include a commissioning program for new operas; free dress rehearsals for the public; a free live transmission of the opening-night performance onto screens at Times Square and Lincoln Center Plaza; a rush tickets program that offers select orchestra seats for weekday and weekend performances at reduced prices; and the Arnold and Marie Schwartz Gallery Met, a contemporary art exhibition space in the Met lobby that presents new work connected to Met productions by artists that have included John Currin, William Kentridge, Julie Mehretu, Elizabeth Peyton, Julian Schnabel, and Dana Schutz. Gelb asserted the importance of his combining the roles of financial and general management with that of being overall creative director. He described plans to stage more productions each year but in an era of computer-generated visual effects, possibly no longer needing \\"tons of scenery\\" built and retained for each new production. These were among other plans for drawing in new (and younger) audiences without deterring the older opera lovers, the wealth and patronage of some of whom sustains the most lavish privately financed opera house in the world. During his tenure at the Met, Gelb has spearheaded the production of contemporary works, including the staging of two of John Adams's operas, Doctor Atomic and Nixon in China, with a third, The Death of Klinghoffer, planned for autumn 2014. His other ideas have included an annual \\"family-oriented\\" presentation at Christmas time, and collaborations with the Vivian Beaumont Theater of Lincoln Center to develop newer musical works with musicians such as Wynton Marsalis, Rachel Portman, and Rufus Wainwright. In January 2007 Gelb announced a commission for a new opera from Osvaldo Golijov, tentatively scheduled for the 2010-11 season. However, following the death in 2008 of Anthony Minghella who was to have written the libretto, the premiere was postponed to 2018.Lawless, Jill. \\"Minghella won Oscar for 'English Patient'\\".

Gelb received a Peabody Award for his four-part television series Marsalis on Music (1995), in which jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis introduces young audiences to the full experience of classical music and jazz. Gelb also won Peabody Awards for the 1986 televised concert Horowitz in Moscow and for the Met’s Live in HD series. In 2001, he co-directed and produced a 90-minute documentary entitled Recording The Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks, about the making of the hit Broadway show’s cast album. The film was awarded a Grammy in 2002. Three of the Met’s Live in HD productions released on DVD—John Adams’s Doctor Atomic, Wagner’s Ring cycle, and Thomas Adès’s The Tempest (the last two both directed by Robert Lepage)—won consecutive Grammys for best opera recording for the company and for Gelb as executive producer between 2011 and 2013. He also received the Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award for the Live in HD series in 2011. TIME magazine named Gelb a 2008 honoree of the Time 100 list of the world’s most influential people. In 2010, France honored him as an Officier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and in 2012 he received the Diplomacy Award of the Foreign Policy Association. In 2013, Gelb received the Sanford Prize from the Yale School of Music, and was named Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur by the French President. Gelb has received honorary doctorates from Hamilton College and from the William E. Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York. In 2019, he received the Gold Medal from the National Institute of Social Sciences.  Controversy  Gelb's history at Sony Classical caused concern among critics when he was appointed to take over as General Manager at the Metropolitan Opera. He responded to fears that he would dilute the Met's artistic standards as he seeks a wider audience for the company, saying “I think what I’m doing is exactly what the Met engaged me to do, which is build bridges to a broader public. This is not about dumbing down the Met, it’s just making it accessible.\\" Gelb's relationship with the press became strained during his time at the Metropolitan Opera, that his new production of Der Ring des Nibelungen and, by extension his tenure as the company's general manager, received poor reviews. In 2012, radio station WQXR- FM rescinded a blog post by critic Olivia Giovetti reportedly after Gelb complained to the station's chief executive. Giovetti's piece opined that the Met under Gelb \\"bears the mothball-like scent of an oligarchy.\\" In a phone call to the station, Gelb called the piece \\"awful and nasty.\\" Weeks later, following an equally critical essay about the Met under Gelb by Brian Kellow and a negative review of the Met's new production of The Ring, the magazine Opera News—produced by the Met Opera Guild, a support organization—announced it would no longer review Metropolitan Opera productions. Gelb said the decision was made “in collaboration with the guild\\". However, due to negative public reaction, the decision was quickly reversed. In 2014 Gelb and the Met were dogged by new controversy with a production of John Adams's opera The Death of Klinghoffer, due to criticism that the work was antisemitic. In response to the controversy Gelb canceled the scheduled worldwide HD video presentation of a performance, but refused demands to cancel the live performances scheduled for October and November 2014.The Met, the opera on the murder of Leon Klinghoffer and the politics of protest - The Washington Post Demonstrators held signs and chanted \\"Shame on Gelb\\". Gelb was contacted by a police detective in October 2016 about allegations of sexual abuse of a minor by Met conductor James Levine. Gelb had been aware of the accuser's abuse allegations since they were made in a 2016 police report, and of the attendant police investigation, but did not suspend Levine or launch an investigation until over a year later.\\"Metropolitan Opera suspends James Levine over sexual abuse allegations,\\" The Washington Post.\\"Legendary opera conductor molested teen for years: police report,\\" The New York Post.\\"Met Opera Reels as Fourth Man Accuses James Levine of Sexual Abuse,\\" The New York Times. Classical music blogger, former Village Voice music critic, and Juilliard School faculty member Greg Sandow said: \\"Everybody in the classical music business at least since the 1980s has talked about Levine as a sex abuser. The investigation should have been done decades ago.\\"\\"Met Opera waited year to act on accusation against James Levine,\\" NY Daily News. Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic Justin Davidson mused: \\"I’m not sure the Met can survive Levine’s disgrace.\\"Justin Davidson. \\"The Met May Not Survive the James Levine Disgrace\\" Similarly, The Wall Street Journal's drama critic Terry Teachout wrote an article entitled: “The Levine Cataclysm: How allegations against James Levine of sexual misconduct with teenagers could topple the entire Metropolitan Opera”. Personal life Peter Gelb is the son of Arthur Gelb, former Managing Editor of The New York Times, and writer Barbara Gelb. Gelb is married to conductor Keri Lynn Wilson. He has two children from a previous marriage. His elder son, David Gelb, is a director and cinematographer, most known for his documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. His younger son, Matthew Gelb, is a film editor based in New York City. In 2019, Gelb received an Honorary Doctorate from Manhattan School of Music.

The park follows the shore of the St. Croix River for and contains the last of the Kettle River. At it is the largest Minnesota state park. It was developed as a Recreational Demonstration Area in the 1930s, and is one of the finest surviving properties of this type in the nation. 164 structures built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration survive, the largest collection of New Deal projects in Minnesota. As a historic district they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places and proclaimed a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Natural history The St. Croix River Valley was carved by meltwater during the last glacial period circa 10,000 BC. The water deposited a variety of sediments, which compose over 30 different types of soil within the park. Some soils are very sandy while others are made of red or yellow clay. The historic Yellowbanks area of the park is named for its distinctive deposit of yellow clay exposed by the St. Croix River. The bedrock of the area is mostly buried under of these glacial till deposits. However the underlying basalt and sandstone is exposed in one area along the Kettle River known as the Highbanks, where a final ancient flood of meltwater scoured away the sediments. In addition to the two rivers, at least ten other streams flow through the park, creating a watershed of hundreds of square miles. St. Croix State Park is located on the eastern edge of the Mille Lacs Uplands. Initially dominated by red and white pines, the vegetation has been altered by logging and farming. The present secondary forest is a mix of pines, black spruce, sugar maple, and basswood. More open areas form meadows, oak savanna, and jack pine barrens. Numerous lakes, marshes, and streams support wetland and riparian zone plants. Wetlands with no outlet and high acidity support tamarack bogs. Large mammals found in the park include white- tailed deer, coyotes, raccoons, gray and red foxes, beavers, bobcats, black bears, and timber wolves. Birds include the ruffed grouse, warbler, flycatcher, eagles, owls, and osprey. They roam along the St. Croix River. A tornado hit part of the park on July 4, 1977. Straight-line winds toppled trees over hundreds of acres on July 11, 2008 and again on July 1, 2011. In the latter storm, many of the historical structures were damaged. However, there were no injuries as the park was closed due to the 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown. Cultural history Evidence of Native American occupation in the park and the St. Croix River Valley has been found dating back 5,000 years. The region was inhabited by the Dakota people by the late 17th century, when French traders began exploring the region.State of Minnesota, Department of Natural Resources. St. Croix State Park. April 2008. However the Dakota were soon displaced by the Ojibwe. Fur traders became more numerous, and a trading post was established within what is now St. Croix State Park. Following an 1837 treaty with the Ojibwe the region was opened up to logging, although harvesting in the park did not begin until later in the 19th century. From 1894 to 1898 the Empire Lumber Company operated a rail line, the Flemming Railroad, to transport logs cut farther inland to the St. Croix River. The line ended at Yellowbanks where the logs were rolled down the steep bluffs and floated to sawmills downriver. St. John's Landing, at the northeast end of the park, is named for Ed St. John, who opened a popular boarding house there for lumbermen. The area was logged out by 1915 and farmers were attracted to the newly cleared land. However the sandy soil was poor and not productive enough to make a living. Most settlers moved away and much of the land was tax-forfeited. Pine County had the most tax delinquent property in Minnesota and suffered abject environmental degradation from cultivation and wildfires like the Great Hinckley Fire. In 1934 the area was selected for a Recreational Demonstration Area, a New Deal program that provided jobs, paid farmers for poor cropland, and created outdoor recreation opportunities near urban areas (the site is midway between Minneapolis–St. Paul and Duluth).Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. St. Croix State Park interpretive signage. An initial of land were transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior, as the National Park Service would direct the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). A CCC camp was constructed at Yellowbanks, populated first by Company #2762 and later #2706. Crews built the main park road, following the old Flemming Railroad route, and another of road. Trails and scenic overlooks were established while farm buildings were demolished. From Camp Yellowbanks the crews used sandstone and lumber from within the park to develop five separate areas for visitors. First was park headquarters, second Riverview Campground and a lodge which is now the interpretive center. The other three were group centers constructed by WPA crews: Norway Point for boys, St. John's Landing for girls, and Head of the Rapids for handicapped children. Some crews planted pine, spruce, and hardwood trees to begin reforestation while others conducted wildlife and fire protection work. A CCC crew built a fire tower in 1937. As additional properties were added, St. Croix Recreational Demonstration Area grew to , only slightly smaller than the country's largest RDA at Custer State Park in South Dakota. As planned following federal development, St. Croix Recreational Demonstration Area was transferred to the state to become St. Croix State Park in 1943. The fire tower was staffed during fire season until 1981, when aerial surveys became the preferred spotting method. St. John's Landing Group Center is now a camp for the Minnesota Conservation Corps. Recreation The St. Croix and Kettle Rivers are navigable by canoe or kayak. The St. Croix is entirely flat water while the Kettle contains some rapids. Both rivers support game fish like northern pike, bass, sauger, and muskellunge. Hay Creek and some of the park's other streams contain trout. Hay Creek widens into Lake Clayton, which has a swimming beach and picnic area. A paved trail leads from Lake Clayton to the drive-in campground, which has three loops with a total of 211 sites. Elsewhere there are eight group campsites and remote campsites for backpackers and canoers. More modern accommodation is provided by two group centers, five cabins, and two guest houses. Of the trails in the park, are open for hiking, for horseback riding, for mountain biking, for snowmobiles, and for cross-country skiing. The Willard Munger State Trail passes through the length of the park. Visitors can climb the 134 steps to the cab of the fire tower; interpretive signs describe the layers of the forest habitat and features of the surrounding countryside. St. Croix State Park borders Chengwatana State Forest to the southwest and Saint Croix State Forest to the northeast. Governor Knowles State Forest lies across the river in Wisconsin. The entire river corridor is part of the Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway. The Kettle River is designated a State Wild and Scenic River.

Early life Anna was born on October 25, 1837 in Dalton, Ohio, and was the daughter of James Richardson and Anna (née Ranck) Richardson. Not much is known about her early life. Married life On February 13, 1854, then sixteen-year-old Anna was married to the 34-year-old Stephen Vanderburgh Harkness, an early investor with John D. Rockefeller and became the second-largest shareholder in Standard Oil before his death in March 1888. Stephen had previously been married to Laura Osborne, who died in August 1852, and with whom he had three children, only one of whom, Lamon V. Harkness, was living at the time of their marriage. Together, Anna and Stephen lived at his estate on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland (known as Millionaires' Row) were the parents of four more children, three of whom survived to adulthood: * Jennie A. Harkness (1856–1864), who died young. * Charles William Harkness (1860–1916), who married Mary Warden (1864–1916) in 1896; both died of influenza in 1916. * Florence Harkness (1864–1895), who married the widower Louis Henry Severance (1838–1913). * Edward Stephen Harkness (1874–1940), who married Mary Stillman (1874–1950), daughter of New York attorney Thomas Stillman, in 1904. Her husband died aboard his yacht on March 6, 1888, and was buried in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery. He left an estate valued at $150,000,000 (equivalent to $ today) and Anna inherited one-third of his fortune at $50,000,000 (equivalent to $ today), consisting primarily of stock in Standard Oil. In 1891, Anna moved to New York City, but continued to maintain a home in Willoughby, Ohio. She died on March 27, 1926 at her home, 820 Fifth Avenue in New York City. After a private funeral, she was buried alongside her late husband in Lake View Cemetery. At her death, she had already given away $40,000,000, yet her wealth had increased to nearly $85,000,000 (equivalent to $ today). =Philanthropy= Their first child, Jennie, died aged seven in 1864. After her death, the Harknesses erected and furnished a memorial pavilion at Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland as a memorial to her. On July 29, 1895, within a year of Florence's marriage to Louis Severance, the former Treasurer of Standard Oil, their second daughter also died. Similarly, Anna and her son-in-law Louis donated the funds for the construction of the Florence Harkness Memorial Chapel at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. After her eldest son Charles died in 1916, Anna gave $3,000,000 (equivalent to $ today) to Yale University for the construction of Memorial Quadrangle in Charles' memory, including Harkness Tower, the most visible symbol of Yale on the New Haven skyline. Anna's portrait by Albert Herter is displayed in the dining hall of Saybrook College, part of the Memorial Quadrangle. In 1920, she donated an additional $3,000,000 to Yale towards increases in faculty salaries.Reports Made to the President of Yale University. By Yale University. President's Office, (1921). In October 1918, Anna established the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation dedicated to the improvement of healthcare with an initial gift of $10,000,000 (equivalent to $ today). Along with her son, Edward, the foundation made charitable gifts totaling more than $129 million, the equivalent of $2 billion in 2005 dollars, including funds for the establishment of the Harkness Fellowships, the construction of St. Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews, the Butler Library at Columbia University, and many of the undergraduate dormitories at Harvard and Yale Universities (known as \\"houses\\" and \\"residential colleges,\\" respectively). The fund was also a major benefactor of the Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes, the Museum of Natural History in New York, the New York Zoological Society and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it established the Museum's collection of ancient Egyptian art.

At the time, Ali and Marciano were the only undefeated heavyweight champions in history and fans often debated who would win had they met in their primes. Ali and Marciano were filmed sparring for 75 one-minute rounds producing several possible scenarios for a genuine fight, with the result claimed to have been determined using probability formulas entered into a computer. The final film was only shown once in select cinemas around the world, grossing from 1,500 theaters across North America and Europe. It was released as a DVD over three decades later. Background In 1967, radio producer Murray Woroner had the idea of determining the all-time great heavyweight champion of the world by placing boxing champions of different eras in a series of fantasy fights. Woroner sent out a survey to 250 boxing experts and writers to help determine which boxers would be used in what would become a fantasy tournament. Hank Meyer, president and salesman with a one other partner in SPS, was instrumental in setting this competition up, and contended at the time that it was his idea. Woroner picked the first round of fantasy matches to be: * Jack Dempsey vs. Gentleman Jim Corbett * John L. Sullivan vs. Jim Braddock * Bob Fitzsimmons vs. Jack Sharkey * Jim Jeffries vs. Jersey Joe Walcott * Joe Louis vs. Jess Willard * Max Baer vs. Jack Johnson * Rocky Marciano vs. Gene Tunney * Muhammad Ali vs. Max Schmeling Punch-by-punch details of the boxer's records during their prime were entered into an NCR 315 computer. Also their strengths, weaknesses, fighting styles and patterns and other factors and scenarios that the boxers could go through were converted into formulas. The NCR-315 with 20K of memory was supplied by SPS (Systems Programming Services), an independent service bureau in Miami, Florida. The algorithms were supplied by an NCR mathematician, and programming was done in Fortran by an employee of SPS. Hank Meyer, President and salesman with a one other partner in SPS, was instrumental in setting this competition up, and contended at the time that it was his idea. The actual running of the software was done the night before each broadcast round of the 'computer championship' and took approximately 45 minutes to run, the output was a formatted report containing a series of codes describing each punch. This was then written to magnetic tape, the tape was then manually transferred to a Univac 1005 and printed. This took place in early 1968. The outcomes were then staged as radio plays with Woroner and radio announcer Guy LeBow as the commentators. The fantasy fights were broadcast worldwide. Even the boxers who were still alive at the time listened to the programs and some of them participated as commentators. After the series of elimination rounds, the final fight was between Dempsey and Marciano. Marciano defeated Dempsey and was considered to be the all-time greatest heavyweight champion by the computer. Woroner awarded the real Marciano a gold and diamond championship belt worth $10,000. The film A cinema ticket for the fictional computer fight pitting Muhammad Ali against Rocky Marciano in 1969. On the back of the radio broadcasts, Muhammad Ali filed a $1 million lawsuit against Woroner for defamation of character, stating his anger at his elimination at the second round to Jim Jeffries, a boxer Ali had previously called \\"history's clumsiest, most slow-footed heavyweight.\\" The lawsuit was settled when Woroner offered to pay Ali $10,000 whilst also getting his agreement to participate in a filmed version of a fantasy fight in which he would fight Marciano. Ali and Marciano agreed on the condition that they would also receive a cut of the film's profits. Marciano, whose last fight before retiring undefeated at 49–0 was 14 years prior, also agreed to participate with a similar deal. In preparation for the film, Rocky lost over and wore a toupee in order to look as he did in his prime. Both he and Ali were reported to be enthusiastic about meeting each other and getting back in the ring. The same formulas as the radio fantasy fights were used and entered into the NCR 315, with filming commencing February 1969 in a Miami studio. The two fighters sparred for between 70 and 75 rounds, exchanging mainly body blows with some head shots in-between, which were later edited together according to the findings of the computer. Braddock, Louis, Schmeling, Sharkey and Walcott also recorded commentary to be used in the film. The final outcome would not be revealed until the release of the film on January 20, 1970, shown in 1,500 theaters via closed-circuit television in the United States, Canada, and throughout Europe. American and Canadian audiences were shown a version where the computer had determined that Marciano would have knocked Ali out in the 13th round, whilst European audiences were shown another ending in which Ali was depicted the winner by KO also in the 13th round. Box office and reaction In the United States, the film grossed more than from more than a thousand theaters. Across North America and Europe, the film grossed from 1,500 theaters. Three weeks after filming was completed, Rocky Marciano died in a plane crash on the eve of what would have been his 46th birthday. No feedback was recorded from him personally regarding the film, with the exception of Marciano's brother Peter who claimed that upon Rocky being asked whether he would win the fantasy fight, he was confident that he would win. Ali attended a screening of the film the night of the release. He immediately relaunched legal proceedings against Woroner, again stating defamation of character, alleging the film's marketing had misled audiences worldwide to believe the fight was actual, whilst also stating any version of the film which depicted him losing was a result of him not taking the simulation seriously. He also claimed American audiences were left angered by Marciano being depicted the winner and disputed whether the NCR 315 computer was used at all during or after filming. Ali later dropped the lawsuit upon discovering his depicted win in European theatres, whilst also having been made aware of the filmmakers plans to destroy remaining prints of the film to prevent potential legal action. In a 1976 interview, Ali briefly recapped on the film maintaining his ridicule of the style of filming and depicted outcomes. He however praised Marciano as a boxer stating they left filming on good terms. Destruction of film prints and recovery During the buildup to the film's release, concerns were held regarding Ali's ban from boxing being active at the time of the film's conceptualization, recording and release, and were later fueled by allegations that marketing and promotional work for the film did not clearly detail that the fight was fictional and the outcome was decided by the NCR 315 computer as well as opinions of boxing experts. Upon the film's release, believing audiences were misled to believe the fight was actual and Ali threatening a second lawsuit upon Woroner, the producers announced all film prints had been destroyed. Debates subsequently took place over the next three decades as to whether at least one print of film had survived. It was cited that many theaters had continued to play the film long after January 20, 1970, and was also noted that the film had one airing on ABC's Wide World of Sports in 1970, and another on CBS late night in 1977, with many more broadcasts alleged throughout. Following an official discovery of a surviving print in 2005, the film was authorized for release and distribution. On December 27, 2005, The Superfight: Marciano vs. Ali was released on DVD and has been televised several times since. The DVD includes a documentary about the film, audio of the original radio fantasy fights, archival interviews with the fighters that were chosen, and other features. Legacy The Super Fight was featured in and inspired the plot of the 2006 film Rocky Balboa.

Yoffie is a Reform rabbi, and President Emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ), the congregational arm of the Reform movement in North America, which represents an estimated 1.5 million Reform Jews in more than 900 synagogues across the United States and Canada. He was the unchallenged head of American Judaism’s largest denomination from 1996 to 2012.Forward 50, 2007: Eric Yoffie, The Jewish Daily Forward, November 10, 2006 Following his retirement in 2012, he has been a lecturer and writer; his writings appear regularly in The Huffington Post, The Jerusalem Post, and Haaretz. Family and career Rabbi Yoffie was raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, where his family belonged to historic Temple Emanuel, and he was involved in the Reform Movement's Youth organization, the North American Federation of Temple Youth (NFTY). He first held the position of president in the Northeast Region of NFTY before moving on to be the organization's Vice President in 1965-1966. After high school Yoffie spent his freshman year at Stanford University, and graduated from Brandeis University. He received his Rabbinical ordination from Hebrew Union College in New York in 1974. He served congregations in Lynbrook, NY, and Durham, NC, before joining the URJ as director of the Midwest Council in 1980. In 1983 he was named Executive Director of the Association of Reform Zionists of America (ARZA). In 1992 he became vice president of the URJ and director of the Commission on Social Action. In addition, he served as executive editor of the Reform Judaism magazine. On July 1, 1996, he succeeded Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler as president of the Union for Reform Judaism. In 1999 The Jewish Daily Forward named Yoffie the number one Jewish leader in America.Yoffie’s Legacy: ‘Old Ideas’ for Reform Judaism, The Jewish Daily Forward, March 23, 2011 He is married to Amy Jacobson Yoffie. The couple has two children, and reside in Westfield, New Jersey. On June 10, 2010, Rabbi Yoffie announced his intention to step down from the post of president of the URJ at the age of 65, in June 2012.Rabbi Eric Yoffie Announces Retirement, eJewish Philanthropy, June 11, 2010 He was succeeded by Rabbi Rick Jacobs, who had served as the senior rabbi at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale, NY.Once a Critic, New Leader of Reform Judaism Promises Change, by Josh Nathan-Kazis, The Jewish Daily Forward, March 23, 2011 Views on Jewish life Rabbi Yoffie has been a proponent of increased traditionalism within Reform Judaism, encouraging a greater focus on Jewish text study and prayer. Dr. Jonathan Sarna, the dean of American Jewish historians, noted that Yoffie devoted time as President of the URJ to bringing “old ideas” to Reform Judaism, “urging its rank and file to focus on enriching their spiritual lives and expanding their knowledge of Judaism.”Rabbi Yoffie’s Legacy: ‘Old Ideas’ for Reform Judaism, The Jewish Daily Forward, by Jonathan D. Sarna, June 16, 2010 During his tenure, he announced two major worship initiatives. The first, in 1999, was designed to help congregations become “houses in which we pray with joy.”Sermon at the Orlando Biennial by Rabbi Eric Yoffie, December 17, 1999 The second, eight years later, fostered Shabbat observance among individual Reform Jews while encouraging congregations to rethink their Shabbat morning worship. Rabbi Yoffie was also a proponent of lifelong Jewish study and helped synagogues to develop programs that increased Jewish literacy among adults. In 2005, he introduced the Sacred Choices curriculum to teach sexual ethics to teens in Reform camps and congregations. In his recent writings, Yoffie has argued against understandings of Judaism that are primarily secular or cultural, referring to such Jews as \\"self-delusional,\\" and suggesting that such understandings mistake a part for the whole and that a religiously-grounded Judaism is essential to assure the Jewish future. Views on interfaith relations Rabbi Yoffie has been a pioneer in interfaith relations and launched Movement-wide dialogue programs with both Christians and Muslims. In 2005, he was the first Jew to address the Churchwide Assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Later that year, he harshly criticized some positions of the Religious Right, but in 2006 he accepted the invitation of the Rev. Jerry Falwell to address the students and faculty of Liberty University; as the first Rabbi to appear at a university-wide convocation, he talked frankly of areas of agreement and disagreement between Evangelical Christians and Jews. Yoffie first spoke shared values of family and morality before defending church-state separation and gay marriage, which elicited boos from the students. On August 21, 2007 Rabbi Yoffie was the first leader of a major Jewish organization to speak at the convention of the Islamic Society of North America. In his remarks he spoke of \\"a huge and profound ignorance of Islam\\" by Jews and Christians in North America. He stated that “the time has come to listen to our Muslim neighbors speak, from their heart and in their own words, about the spiritual power of Islam and their love for their religion.” He also asked Muslims for more understanding of Judaism: “The dialogue will not be one way, of course. You will teach us about Islam and we will teach you about Judaism. We will help you to overcome stereotyping of Muslims, and you will help us to overcome stereotyping of Jews.” Rabbi Yoffie later was a supporter of the Park51 Community Center, and he has been a strong advocate for the rights of Muslim Americans. In contrast to these above interfaith efforts, Yoffie strongly disagrees with atheism, claiming that it lacks \\"humility, imagination, and curiosity.\\" Views on social justice As President of the URJ, Rabbi Yoffie spoke to a wide variety of social justice issues. He opposed the death penalty, supported LBGT rights, and was a prominent spokesperson for gun control. He was the only religious leader to appear at the Million Mom March in Washington, D.C., declaring that “the indiscriminate distribution of guns is an offense against God and humanity.” Rabbi Yoffie went on to state that “our gun-flooded society has turned weapons into idols, and the worship of idols must be recognized for what it is—blasphemy. And the only appropriate religious response to blasphemy is sustained moral outrage.” Views on relations with Israel Rabbi Yoffie has devoted much of his public life to working on behalf of the Jewish state and to promoting close ties between Israel and American Jews. During his years as URJ President, he met frequently with Israel’s elected officials to present the concerns of the Reform movement and North American Jewry. He has been a prominent advocate of religious freedom and religious pluralism in Israel, arguing that the cause of Judaism can only be advanced by education and persuasion and not by coercion. In an incident that drew international headlines, Rabbi Yoffie in June 2006 declined to meet with Israeli President Moshe Katsav after the President refused to address Rabbi Yoffie with the title \\"Rabbi\\". The Chief Rabbinate of Israel does not recognize rabbinic ordinations from non-Orthodox institutions,Katsav Hosts Conservative Amid ‘Rabbi’ Feud, by Nathaniel Popper, The Jewish Daily Forward, June 30, 2006 In 2014, Rabbi Yoffie challenged the Presidential candidate, Reuven Rivlin, by asking if he would address Reform rabbis by the title “rabbi”? While Rivlin did not respond directly to this issue while a candidate, a source close to him responded that he “has always received Rabbi Yoffie respectfully and will continue to have a wonderful relationship with Diaspora Jews.\\" Contemporary spirituality In his recent writings, in the Huffington Post and elsewhere, Rabbi Yoffie has addressed broad questions of belief and spirituality in American life. In particular, he has applied a progressive religious point of view to issues of sin, atheism, and community, as well as contemporary matters such as immigration, health care, and economic justice. In “What it Means to be a Liberal Person of Faith” and in other widely read articles, he has suggested that progressive religion has a vital role to play during a time of “culture wars,” fear of terrorism, and economic uncertainty.

It is a standard of the U.S. march repertoire, appearing in eleven published editions. The U.S. military uses the trio section as ceremonial music for the entry of the ceremony's official party. History \\"National Emblem March\\", performed in 1977 by the U.S. Naval Academy Band Bagley composed the score during a 1902 train tour with his family band, Wheeler's Band of Bellows Falls, Vermont.Bellows Falls Historical Society. He became frustrated with the ending, and tossed the composition in a bin. Members of the band retrieved it and secretly rehearsed the score in the baggage car. Bagley was surprised when the band informed him minutes before the next concert that they would perform it. It became the most famous of all of Bagley's marches. Despite this the composition did not make Bagley wealthy; he sold the copyright for $25. In the first strain, Bagley incorporated the first twelve notes of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" played by euphonium, bassoon, alto clarinet, tenor saxophone, and trombone, disguised in duple rather than triple time. The rest of the notes are all Bagley's, including the four short repeated A-flat major chords that lead to a statement by the low brass that is now reminiscent of the national anthem. Unusually, Bagley's march does not incorporate either a breakstrain or a stinger however the exact repetition of the trio's melody at a chromatic mediant (A-flat Major/m.3 of Trio, then C Major/m.10 of Trio) is suggestive of a breakstrain. John Philip Sousa was once asked to list the three most effective street marches ever written. Not surprisingly, Sousa listed two of his own compositions, but he selected \\"National Emblem\\" for the third. When Sousa formed and conducted the 350-member U.S. Navy Jacket Band at the Naval Station Great Lakes he chose five marches for World War I Liberty bond drives. Four were by Sousa—\\"Semper Fidelis\\", \\"Washington Post\\", \\"The Thunderer\\", \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\", and Bagley's \\"National Emblem March\\". \\"National Emblem March\\" was the favorite march composition of Frederick Fennell, who made an arrangement of it in 1981. Fennell called the piece \\"as perfect a march as a march can be\\". Besides Fennell's arrangement, there are also band arrangements by Albert Morris (1978), Andrew Balent (1982), Paul Lavender (1986), and Loris J. Schissel (2000). The band of Arthur Pryor made the first recording of the march on May 19, 1908, followed by a United States Marine Band recording on March 21, 1914 (both recordings by the Victor Talking Machine Company). In popular culture *In 1960 a group of studio musicians led by Ernie Freeman recorded a rock and roll arrangement of the tune, which was subsequently released as a Liberty Records single under the title National City and credited to the Joiner (Arkansas) Junior High School Band. It became a minor hit, reaching #53 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. *The march has been featured in films such as The Dirty Dozen, Protocol and Hot Shots!.

Bavarian flautist Theobald Boehm, inventor of the fingering system for the modern western concert flute, composed a theme and variations for flute and piano on this tune. Notable performances The song is heard in the 1961 film Judgment at Nuremberg during a key scene between Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich. In 1974's Blazing Saddles, Madeline Kahn, caricaturing Dietrich, sings it with a group of Prussian soldiers. It also features in Top Secret!, The Winds of War, Le Silence de la mer, the Barbara Stanwyck film Ever in My Heart and in Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat, sung by Walter Slezak. It was sung by the Kenneth Mars character, Franz Liebkind, in The Producers. In the 1991 film, What About Bob?, a gleeful Richard Dreyfuss whistles the melody of the chorus. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). German-American jazz keyboardist Clare Fischer recorded two dramatically contrasting versions in 1975 and 1980, a solo piano performance on Alone Together and his arrangement for a Latin jazz ensemble supplemented by the vocal quartet 2+2 on the eponymous album 2+2.

Ranked as the richest man in Scotland in 2005, he contributed to the development of game reserves in Africa and bought Letterewe estate in Scotland, where he pledged the right to roam, years ahead of the rest of the country. Early life Paul Fentener van Vlissingen was the youngest son of Frits Fentener van Vlissingen II, one of the leading Dutch industrialist families whose fortune was based on shipping coal on the Rhine in the 19th century. Frits III, his eldest brother, died in March 2006. John, the middle brother, is the last alive. Paul inherited a significant shareholding in the company SHV Holdings from his father, Frits II, whose own father had co- founded the business through a merger with eight other Dutch trading families in 1896. Paul's father, described as one of the \\"fathers of the Dutch economy\\", later bought out most of the other families. SHV Holdings  Paul Fentener van Vlissingen studied economics at the University of Groningen before joining SHV. Originally Europe's largest coal wholesaling business, SHV is the largest privately owned company in the Netherlands. In May 1974, he joined the SHV board, and succeeded his brother, Frits, as chairman in 1980. Paul led SHV as chief executive officer for three decades from the mid-1960s. Under his leadership, the company diversified into new areas ahead of the collapse of the coal market in the 1960s. The areas he became involved with included retail – through the Makro and Otto Reichelt chains of grocery supermarkets and cash & carries – and energy – through the acquisitions of LPG companies including Calor Gas in the UK and Primagaz in France. He also diversified into scrap metal, recycling, oil exploration, renewable energy and private equity. In 1995 he stepped down and then served as non-executive chairman. Fentener van Vlissingen had a maverick leadership style and was more philosophical than most business leaders. For example, he recognised the possibility of the existence of global warming as early as the early 1990s and had a love for cryptic aphorisms. He allowed young managers whom he trusted to establish Makro operations in overseas markets, giving them unusual amounts of autonomy.  Philanthropy and conservation  Fentener Van Vlissingen was recognised as an enlightened conservationist and contributed to the development of game reserves in Scotland, South Africa, Malawi, Zambia and Ethiopia. In 1978 he bought the wild and roadless Letterewe estate in Wester Ross, and in 2006 was described as the largest foreign landowner in Scotland. \\"I don't call myself the owner,\\" he said of Letterewe. \\"You can't own a place like this. It belongs to the planet. I'm only the guardian of it.\\" An obituary in The Independent said that van Vlissingen sometimes saddled a pony with a week's provisions and disappeared into the hills, staying at a bothy without lights or a toilet. The obituary said: \\"He was in the habit of inviting everyone, whether landowners, journalists, birdwatchers or ramblers, to visit the estate and talk about issues face to face.\\" He also proposed reintroducing wolves and lynx to this estate. The Letterewe Accord, an agreement that gave ramblers freedom of access to the entire Letterewe estate in exchange for a pledge to respect the land, predated the Scottish Parliament's own right-to- roam legislation by over a decade. Van Vlissingen was also a great supporter of Scottish Gaelic, and donated £250,000 to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Gaelic college on Skye. From 1994 until his death, his home was the Conholt Park estate in Wiltshire, England, on the border with Hampshire. Here too he applied sustainable land management and nature conservation. The Sunday Times Rich List 2005 ranked Van Vlissingen as the richest man in Scotland, with an estimated wealth of £1.1 billion. After a near fatal brush with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1980, he founded the Van Vlissingen Cancer Fund, which is now one of the major cancer fundraisers in the Netherlands.  Entrepreneurs are Jackasses  In 2001 he wrote a book entitled Ondernemers zijn ezels (), which can be translated as Entrepreneurs are Jackasses. In this book he discussed his experiences directing a large multi-national conglomerate. He followed this up in 2002 with a book entitled Overstekende ezels (), translated as Crossing Jackasses. In this he discusses his views regarding entrepreneurs, corruption, ambition, the euro, money, honesty, change and success.  Deathbed warning for the planet  In April 2006, van Vlissingen announced that he had terminal pancreatic cancer and that he would not be having chemotherapy. He said: \\"In the Western world we mistakenly try to keep death at bay. I look to Native Americans instead. When they see their death approaching, they visit good friends and family to share happy memories and look back at the good things.\\" In an interview with the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf published in April 2006, he said: \\"Our planet is in a much sorrier state than it was when I was a child. The destruction cannot go on at this pace. My generation should be ashamed of the condition in which we are passing on our planet to future generations.\\" In August 2006, the cancer got worse, and this led to his death during the night of the 20–21 August 2006. The information of his death was released to the public on 22 August. Many broadcasters stated (wrongly) that Fentener van Vlissingen was the middle of the three Van Vlissingen brothers. In fact, Paul was the youngest.  Unorthodox to the last  In February 2006 it emerged that in his will Fentener van Vlissingen left a significant portion of his estate to his partner, the former Guardian art critic Caroline Tisdall, as well as several million to his lover Suzanne Wolff. The Scotsman reported that Tisdall had been prepared to tolerate the billionaire's relationship with Wolff in his latter years. He left the bulk of his fortune and the Letterewe Estate in north-west Scotland to his two daughters, Alicia and Tet and to their children.

Hwang was largely responsible for crafting Juche, the official state ideology of North Korea. Early life and education Hwang was born in Kangdong, South Pyongan Province. He graduated from the Pyongyang Commercial School in 1941, and then went to Tokyo in 1942 to attend Chuo University's law school; however, he quit two years later and returned to Pyongyang, where he taught mathematics at his old school. He joined the Workers' Party of Korea in 1946, soon after its founding; from 1949 to 1953, he was sent to study at Moscow University in the Soviet Union, where he met his wife Pak Sung-ok. Upon his return to North Korea, he became head lecturer in philosophy at Kim Il-sung University. He would later ascend to the presidency of that university in April 1965. Career Sometime in the late 1950s, Hwang discovered a 1955 speech in which Kim Il-sung said, \\"Juche means Chosun's revolution\\" (Chosun being the traditional name for Korea). At the time, Kim wanted to develop his own version of Marxism-Leninism, and Hwang was largely responsible for developing what became known as \\"the Juche Idea.\\" As part of this, he helped scrub all of the paeans to Joseph Stalin that had been typical of Kim's speeches in the 1940s and early 1950s. He also supervised the rewriting of Korean Communist history to make it look like Kim had been the founder and leader of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea from its inception. In 1972, Hwang became Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, a position which he would hold for 11 years. In 1983, however, he was removed from the Assembly and his standing deteriorated; though he had been Kim Jong-il's teacher at Kim Il-sung University, Kim now spoke to him only to criticize him, specifically admonishing him for taking too close an interest in China's capitalist reforms. Remarking on his role as advisor to Kim Jong-il, Hwang stated: \\"When I proposed something, he would pretend to listen at first, but in the end, he would never listen.\\" Defection Hwang defected on the way back from a February 1997 trip to Tokyo by walking into the South Korean embassy in Beijing along with his aide Kim Duk-hong, the president of a North Korean trading firm in Beijing. Pyongyang immediately threatened retaliation, while Beijing police sealed off the South Korean embassy. Three days later, North Korean defector Yi Han-yong, the nephew of Kim Jong-il's mistress Song Hye-rim, was shot outside of his home in South Korea in Bundang, Gyeonggi-do, by unknown assailants widely suspected to be North Korean special forces agents; South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung described the attack as retaliation for Hwang's defection. A few days later, Kim Jong-il was quoted on Radio Pyongyang as saying, \\"Cowards, leave if you want to. We will defend the red flag of revolution to the end\\", a message seen as marking acceptance of Hwang's defection. Chinese authorities eventually permitted Hwang to depart for South Korea via the Philippines several weeks later. Considering Hwang's prominent role in the North Korean regime, his defection caused a stir, with The Washington Post saying it was \\"as if Joseph Goebbels had defected from Nazi Germany\\". After his defection, Hwang's wife back in North Korea died by suicide, and one of his daughters died under mysterious circumstances by falling off a truck; his other children, a daughter and a son, as well his grandchildren, are thought to have been sent to labour camps. After his arrival in South Korea, he became a harsh critic of North Korea, publishing over 12 books and treatises, many of which accused Kim Jong-il of \\"betraying Juche and building feudalism instead of socialism\\", and used his position as chairman of the Unification Policy Research Institute to spread his message. However, under the Sunshine Policy of president Kim Dae-jung, who took office in 1998, Hwang found himself increasingly marginalised; in November 2000, he was removed from the chairmanship of the Unification Policy Research Institute, leading him to complain that the South Korean government wanted him to stay quiet so as not to upset the North. Hwang contributed to the Daily NK, an online newspaper set up by South Koreans with North Korean staff. He described his feelings surrounding the defection in the paper.Green, Chris. \\"A Quiet Voice Lost in the Shuffle,\\" Daily NK, June 1, 2012. Accessed 2016-01-03. In April 2010, the South Korean National Intelligence Service announced that it had arrested two North Korean agents who had allegedly been sent to assassinate Hwang. The two agents had reportedly trained for four years in preparation for their mission. They had posed as defectors, but were discovered during questioning by South Korean authorities. They claimed that they would receive assistance from North Korean sympathisers in the South, but refused to give any names when questioned. Hwang commented on the assassination attempt, \\"Death is just death. There is no difference from dying of old age or being killed by Kim Jong-il.\\" In June 2010, South Korea sentenced the two would-be assassins to 10 years in prison. Death Hwang was found dead in his home in Seoul, South Korea, on the morning of 10 October 2010. Initial reports stated that he died of a heart attack. He died while bathing, and as such a large amount of water entered his lungs; however, an autopsy found no poison or drugs in his body, and footage from surveillance cameras showed no signs of forcible entry. On those grounds, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA) stated that there was no evidence that his death might be murder and that they would close their investigation. On 20 October, just shortly after Hwang's death, the SMPA announced that it had arrested another would-be assassin of Hwang, Ri Dong-sam, who had also entered South Korea posing as a North Korean defector; however, the charges had no connection to Hwang's death.

Okean spent 1992 and 1993 seasons in the Top League, being one of the founding members, aided by the fact that the clubs from other Soviet republics walked away from the existing Soviet league system to form their own leagues. They thus became the easternmost club to compete in the Top League (and by extension, all of Europe's top flight leagues, though they never made any European competition), a record they hold until 2017 (when SKA-Khabarovsk won promotion to the top tier of Russian football). The best result they achieved was a 14th position in 1992. After relegation in 1993 Okean played in the First League in 1994–1996, after which they were relegated again. Okean played in the Second Division after 1997. The best result was achieved in 2005, when they finished as runners-up. In 2010 they finished 11th or last in East Zone of Second Division and were relegated to the Amateur Football League for 2011, losing professional status. The club was liquidated in 2015. Notable persons and matches Oleg Garin is considered the best footballer in club's history. One of the club's best matches was played on 30 July 1992, when Okean defeated CSKA at home 5–2.

Examples include the POSIX Threads library and Hadoop's MapReduce. In both cases, the execution model is different from that of the base language in which the code is written. For example, the C programming language has no execution model for input/output or thread behavior. But such behavior can be invoked from C syntax, by making what appears to be a call to a normal C library. What distinguishes a programming model from a normal library is that the behavior of the call cannot be understood in terms of the language the program is written in. For example, the behavior of calls to the POSIX thread library cannot be understood in terms of the C language. The reason is that the call invokes an execution model that is different from the execution model of the language. This invocation of an outside execution model is the defining characteristic of a programming model, in contrast to a programming language. In parallel computing, the execution model often must expose features of the hardware in order to achieve high performance. The large amount of variation in parallel hardware causes a concurrent need for a similarly large number of parallel execution models. It is impractical to make a new language for each execution model, hence it is a common practice to invoke the behaviors of the parallel execution model via an API. So, most of the programming effort is done via parallel programming models rather than parallel languages. Unfortunately, the terminology around such programming models tends to focus on the details of the hardware that inspired the execution model, and in that insular world the mistaken belief is formed that a programming model is only for the case when an execution model is closely matched to hardware features.

It is sometimes called Chinese potato or by its Japanese name nagaimo. It is a perennial climbing vine, native to China and East Asia. The edible tubers are cultivated largely in Asia and sometimes used in alternative medicine. This species of yam is unique as the tubers can be eaten raw.  Range  This plant originating in China now grows throughout East Asia (Japan, Korea, Kuril Islands, Philippines, Vietnam). It is believed to have been introduced to Japan in the 17th century or earlier. Introduced to the United States as early as the 19th century for culinary and cultural uses, it is now considered an invasive plant species.Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States, entry for Dioscorea polystachya The plant was introduced to Europe in the 19th century during the European Potato Failure, where cultivation continues to this day for the Asian food market.  Taxonomy  The botanical names Dioscorea opposita and Dioscorea oppositifolia have been consistently misapplied to Chinese yam. The name D. opposita is now an accepted synonym of D. oppositifolia. Botanical works that point out the error may list, e.g., Dioscorea opposita auct. as a synonym of D. polystachya. Furthermore, neither D. oppositifolia nor the prior D. opposita have been found growing in North America and have no historical range in China or East Asia, this grouping is native only to the subcontinent of India and should not be confused with Dioscorea polystachya. Description Dioscorea polystachya, Chinese yam Dioscorea polystachya vines typically grow 3–5 meters long, but can be longer. They twine clockwise. The leaves are up to 11 centimeters long and wide. They are lobed at the base and larger ones may have lobed edges. The arrangement is variable; they may be alternately or oppositely arranged or borne in whorls. In the leaf axils appear warty rounded bulbils under 2 centimeters long. The bulbils are sometimes informally referred to as \\"yam berries\\" or \\"yamberries\\". New plants sprout from the bulbils or parts of them. The flowers of Chinese yam are cinnamon-scented. The plant produces one or more spindle-shaped or cylindrical tubers. The largest may weigh 10 pounds and grow one meter underground. Dioscorea polystachya is more tolerant to frost and cooler climates than other yams, which is attributed to its successful introductions and establishment on many continents.  Common names  In addition to larger underground tubers, Chinese yam also produces smaller bulbils (aerial tubers), formed where leaves join the stem. These are also edible but not considered as palatable. Some compare their taste to that of new potatoes. In Chinese it is known as huáishān (怀(淮)山),Originated from Jiaozuo (焦作), previously known as \\"Huai Qing Fu (怀庆俯)\\" shānyào (山药, 山藥) (lit. \\"mountain medicine.\\"), or huáishānyào (怀(淮)山药, 怀(淮)山藥)(lit. \\"mountain medicine from Huai\\", i.e. Huai Qing Fu (怀庆俯) region). Rarely, also referred to as shǔyù (薯蕷). The yam bulbils are referred to as shanyao dou 山药豆, i.e. \\"yam beans\\", or shanyao dan 山药蛋 (\\"yam eggs\\"). In Japan, three groups of this species in cultivation are recognized. The common long, cylindrical type is known as nagaimo (lit. 'long yam'; kanji: 長芋). The bears a flat, shape, and the is round or . The term is used particularly in the Kantō region for the ichōimo in the market, but this is confusing since traditionally yamatoimo has also referred to tsukuneimo, especially if produced in Yamato Province (now Nara Prefecture). Cultivars of this species (such as yamatoimo) is sometimes called \\"Japanese mountain yam\\", though that term should properly be reserved for the native Dioscorea japonica. In Korea it is called ma (hangul: 마), \\"sanu (山芋, 산우)\\", seoyeo (薯蕷, 서여), or sanyak (山藥, 산약) and in Sri Lanka in Sinhala it is called wal ala (වැල් අල). Sometimes called Korean yam. In Vietnam, the yam is called củ mài or khoai mài. When this yam is processed to become a medicine, the yam is called hoài sơn or tỳ giải. In the Ilocano of the northern Philippines it is called tuge. In Latin American countries it's known as white name or white ñame. In Manipuri it is called as \\"Ha\\".  In alternative medicine  Creams and dietary supplements made from the related Dioscorea villosa are claimed to contain human hormones and promoted as a medicine for a variety of purposes, including cancer prevention and the treatment of Crohn's disease and whooping cough. However, according to the American Cancer Society, the claims are false and there is no evidence to support these substances being either safe or effective. Huáishān has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine.Xu, Dermatology in Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2004 As an invasive species Dioscorea polystachya was introduced to the United States in the 1800s when it was planted as an ornamental or food crop. It and other introduced yam species now grow wild there. It is troublesome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where its range is \\"rapidly expanding\\". It is most prevalent in moist habitat types. It is more tolerant of frost than other yams and can occur in temperate climates as far north as New York. Uses Grated Dioscorea polystachya (Japanese tororo) The tubers of D. polystachya can be eaten raw (grated or sliced), while most other yams must be cooked before consumption (due to harmful substances in the raw state). First the skin needs to be removed by peeling (or by scraping off using a hard-bristled brush). This may cause a slight irritation to the hand, and wearing a latex glove is advised, but if an itch develops then lemon juice or vinegar may be applied. The peeled whole tubers are briefly soaked in a vinegar-water solution, to neutralize irritant oxalate crystals found in their skin, and to prevent discoloration. The raw vegetable is starchy and bland, mucilaginous when cut or grated, and may be eaten plain as a side dish, or added to noodles, etc. = Japanese cuisine = Tamba (丹波の黒豆とろろうどん) In Japanese cuisine, both the Chinese yam cultivars and the Japanese yam (often wild foraged) are used interchangeably in dishes. The difference is that the nagaimo tends to be more watery, while the native Japanese yam is more viscous. The is the mucilaginous purée made by grating varieties the Chinese yam (nagaimo, ichōimo, tsukuneimo) or the native Japanese yam. The classic Japanese culinary technique is to grate the yam by grinding it against the rough grooved surface of a suribachi, which is an earthenware mortar. Or the yam is first grated crudely using an oroshigane grater, and subsequently worked into a smoother paste in the suribachi using a wooden pestle. The tororo is mixed with other ingredients that typically include tsuyu broth (soy sauce and dashi), sometimes wasabi or green onions, and eaten over rice or (steam-cooked blend of rice and barley). The tororo poured over raw tuna (maguro) sliced into cubes is called yamakake, and eaten with soy sauce and wasabi. The tororo may also be poured over noodles to make tororo udon/soba. Noodles with grated yam over it is also called yamakake. Grated yam is also used as binding agent in the batter of okonomiyaki. Sometimes the grated yam is used as an additive for making the skin of the manjū confection, in which case the product is called . The yam is also used in the making a regional confection called karukan, a specialty of the Kyūshū region. = Chinese cuisine = Chinese yam is referred to as shānyào (山药 / 山藥) in Chinese and the tuber is consumed e.g. raw, steamed or deep-fried. = Korean cuisine = In Korea, there are two main types of Chinese yam: The straight, tube-shaped variant is called jangma (장마 - \\"long ma\\"), while danma (단마 - \\"short ma\\") refers to the variant, which grows shorter, cluster-like tubes. Both are used in cooking and the tubers are prepared in a variety of ways. They are most commonly consumed raw, after the skinned roots have been blended with water, milk or yogurt (occasionally with additional honey) to create a nourishing drink known as ' (마즙) or \\"ma juice\\" (마주스). Alternatively, the peeled tubers are cut into pieces and served - either raw, after cooking, steaming or frying - together with seasoning sauces.  Growing Chinese yam  The Chinese yam's growing cycle spans approximately one year, and should be planted between winter and spring. The traditional methods growing it are: using smaller tubers, top cut of bigger tubers or through cuttings of branches. The first two methods can produce 20 cm (7.8 in) long tubers and above. The latter produces smaller tubers (10 cm or 4 in) that are usually replanted for the next year. Between 7 and 9 months of replanting Chinese yam tubers, their leaves start to get dry (a common fact in plants that grow tubers): that indicates that the tubers are ready for harvest. In home gardens generally only what will be consumed is harvested, with the rest left in the pot in moist soil.

The prospector and the preacher were witnesses at the rape and murder trial of the notorious bandit Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman). The bandit duped an aristocratic Southerner, Colonel Wakefield (Laurence Harvey), into believing he knew the location of a lost Aztec treasure.

These events lead to the stabbing of the husband and Carrasco was tried, convicted, and condemned for the crimes. Everyone's account on the witness stand differed dramatically. Carrasco claimed that Wakefield was tied up with ropes while Nina was assaulted, after which he killed the colonel in a duel. The newlywed wife contends that she was the one who killed her husband because he accused her of leading on Carrasco and causing the rape.

Just as he's about to kill himself, he sees a madman, known as \\"The Creeper\\" (Rondo Hatton), in the process of drowning, and saves him. Taking the disfigured man into his care, he makes him the subject of his next sculpture and calls it his best creation. When critics denigrate Marcel's work, he has the Creeper start killing them.

When Marcel invites her over and she sees Marcel's sculpture of The Creeper, she suspects that Marcel knows the killer. Later, Marcel decides that Joan knows too much and commands The Creeper to kill her. The Creeper is reluctant to do, however, when he discovers that Marcel plans to turn him over to the police. The Creeper kills Marcel, and is about to kill Joan when he is shot by the police. Cast Production On November 8, 1944, an article in The Hollywood Reporter stated that producer Ben Pivar was relieved of all his lower- budget films on his shooting schedule and was going to focus on a larger budget film featuring new horror characters. This included as series featuring actor Rondo Hatton as \\"The Creeper\\". The authors of Universal Horrors suggested this report of a higher budget was either fabricated or the state of the production changes as when House of Horrors was developed, it did not have a larger budget than the average Universal b-film production. Initial shooting for House of Horrors began on September 11. Initially ppKent Taylor was selected to play the part of Police Lt. Larry Brooks, but on the fourth day of production, before he was shot in any scenes, he was replaced by Bill Goodwin. Taylor stated years later that he did play the role in the film, but disliked how the picture exploited actor Rondo Hatton, and demanded to be taken off the film. The assisitant director's daily reports suggest that this story was a lie, stating that Goodwin was the only person to play Brooks on set. Actress Virginia Christine recalled her brief role in the film, stating \\"I needed the money [laughs] - all actors need money!\\". Her only other recollection of the film was that to get a cat to follow her, they put anchovies or sardines on the back of her heel. The scene with the cat is not in the final film. Martin Kosleck was asked to audition for the role while on the Universal lot. He received the script to study during the lunch hour for an audition, and after was offered the part immediately. Kosleck was particularly proud of his performance in the film, stating he received fan mail for it and he \\"loved that part\\". Filming ended on September 25, 1945. Release House of Horrors was shown in New York on February 22, 1946. It received wider release by Universal Pictures on March 29, 1946. A series of Creeper films was planned, and the second one, The Brute Man, was filmed in 1946. Hatton died of complications from acromegaly before either film was released. House of Horrors was released on DVD by the Willette Acquisition Corp. on Sep 27, 2013. It was released on blu-ray by Shout! Factory on March 17, 2020 as the fourth volume in their \\"Universal Horror Collection\\". The set also included Night Key, Night Monster and The Climax. Reception From contemporary reviews, many critics commented on Rondo Hatton, with George H. Spires stating that his \\"Neanderthal features suffice without the aid of make up [...] and his ape-like appearance on the screen brings a gasp to the audience\\" while Edmond J. Bartnett of The New York Times was \\"properly scary\\". Otis L. Guernsey, Jr. of The New York Herald-Tribune found The Creeper to be \\"not in the best of taste.\\" As for the picture overall, a reviewer in Harrison's Reports stated that \\"little about the proceedings to horrify one unless the fact that murders are committed by a half-witted giant can be considered horrendours rather than unpleasant.\\" From retrospective reviews, the authors of the book Universal Horrors found that despite Rondo Hatton's acting and characters in the film being cliches, House of Horrors \\"rates as the best shocker in this last grap of Universal Horrors. It boasts creepy, atmospheric, film-noirish settings, evocative camerawork and is seldom dull.\\" In Leonard Maltin's film guide, the film was awarded two out of four stars, criticizing the script as \\"laughable\\" and moderate acting, calling it \\"[a] Slightly below average horror meller.\\" References =Footnotes= =Sources=  External links  1946 films 1946 horror films 1940s serial killer films American films American black-and-white films Films directed by Jean Yarbrough American monster movies Universal Pictures films Films scored by William Lava ","title":"House of Horrors"},{"id":"4045254","text":"Vampire's Kiss is a 1989 American black comedy horror film directed by Robert Bierman, written by Joseph Minion, and starring Nicolas Cage, María Conchita Alonso, Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Ashley. The film tells the story of a mentally ill literary agent whose condition turns even worse when he believes he was bitten by a vampiress. It was a box office failure but went on to become a cult film.  Plot  Peter Loew (Nicolas Cage) is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one-night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist (Elizabeth Ashley) frequently. During these sessions, his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie (Kasi Lemmons), a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel (Jennifer Beals) at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is metamorphosing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \\"fangs\\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. Shortly after, Loew experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically, asking to meet her at a bar. As he is about to leave, a jealous Rachel appears and beckons him back inside. A dejected Jackie eventually leaves the bar and leaves an angry note on his door asking him to leave her alone. A subplot concerns a secretary working at Loew's office, Alva Restrepo (María Conchita Alonso). Loew torments her by forcing her to search through an enormous file for a 1963 contract. When she fails to find the contract, he at first browbeats and humiliates her, then visits her at home, and finally attacks and attempts to bite her at the place where they both work. She pulls out a gun, and Loew begs her to shoot him. Since it is only loaded with blanks, she fires at the floor to scare him off. He eventually overpowers her and attempts to bite her on the neck, ripping her shirt open and knocking her down. He takes the gun and fires it into his mouth, but is not harmed by the blanks. Thinking he has metamorphosed into a vampire, Loew goes out to a club wearing his vampire teeth and moving like the character Orlok from the film Nosferatu. He begins to seduce a woman, but when he gets too grabby she slaps him off, making Loew even more unhinged: he overpowers her and bites her neck, having taken out the fangs and using his real teeth. He then puts the plastic fangs back in. Leaving the club, Loew has a brief, ambiguous encounter with Rachel: she admits to knowing him, but gives the impression that they have not been in contact for a long period. He accuses her of being a vampiress, and is expelled from the club. Alva wakes up with her shirt ripped open, possibly thinking she was raped, and eventually tells her brother Emilio (Bob Lujan) about the sexual assault, who is enraged and goes after Loew to seek revenge. Meanwhile, Loew is wandering the streets in a blood-spattered business suit, talking to himself. In a hallucinatory exchange, he tells his therapist that he raped someone and also murdered someone else. Based on a newspaper, the latter appears to be true, as the girl he bit in the club is pronounced dead. As Loew returns to his now-disastrous apartment (which he'd been using as a sort of vampire cave) Alva points out Loew to Emilio, who pursues him inside his home with a tire iron. In the midst of an argument with an imaginary romantic interest (supposedly a patient of his psychiatrist) Loew begins to retch again from the blood he had swallowed, and crawls under an upturned sofa, which he sees as his \\"coffin\\". Emilio finds him and upturns the sofa, and Loew holds a large broken shard of wood to his chest as a makeshift stake, repeating the gesture he had made earlier to strangers on the street when he had asked them to stake and kill him. Emilio, in a rage, pushes down on the stake and it pierces Loew's chest. Realizing he has committed a crime, a scared Emilio flees. As Loew dies, he envisions the vampiress Rachel smiling at him one last time. Cast * Nicolas Cage as Peter Loew, a literary critic whose outlandish descent into madness leaves him increasingly isolated and irritant. The role, originally given to Dennis Quaid, was then passed on to Cage after the former dropped out to do Innerspace. * María Conchita Alonso as Alva Restrepo, Secretary to Loew and constant victim to his rants and impatience. * Jennifer Beals as Rachel, the seductive vampire that haunts the dreams of Loew and pushes him into his vampire-like state. Cage and Beals reportedly didn’t get along on set with their friction most likely stemming from the part of Rachel not being cast to Cage's then girlfriend, Patricia Arquette, and instead going to Beals. * Elizabeth Ashley as Dr. Glaser, the therapist of Loew’s real world and imaginary, who listens to his recounts of sexual experiences. * Kasi Lemmons as Jackie, a romantic interest of Loew which he later stands up in favor of a night with Rachel. * Bob Lujan as Emilio Restrepo, the protective brother of Alva who supplies her with a gun and blank ammunition. * Jessica Lundy as Sharon * Johnny Walker as Donald (as John Walker) * Boris Leskin as Fantasy Cabbie * Michael Knowles as Andrew * John Michael Higgins as Ed * Jodie Markell as Joke Girl * Marc Coppola as Joke Guy * David Hyde Pierce as Theater Guy (as David Pierce) * Amy Stiller as Theater Girl * Christopher Sluka as Hanger Out * ESG in a cameo appearance  Production  Written \\"as darkly comic and deft as its bizarre premise,\\" Joseph Minion wrote the film as he grappled with depression. In an interview with Zach Schonfeld of The Ringer, Minion said that while on vacation in Barbados with his then-girlfriend, Barbara Zitwer, he wrote the screenplay as a response to his \\"toxic relationship\\" with her. Dealing with themes of isolation, loneliness, and domination, Zitwer, who would come on as a producer for the film, found the final product to be \\"horrifying.\\" The story was extremely emblematic of their relationship together and Minion's depiction of Zitwer as a \\"vampire and destroying him,\\" was clear foreshadowing to their end of their relationship during production. Known previously for having written After Hours, directed by Martin Scorsese, Minion sought to keep the \\"grim view of the Manhattan nightlife,\\" found in the aforementioned film central to his newest work. Originally intent on taking the helm of directing the project, Minion soon gave the position up stating that the “darkness of it,” was too much for him to bear. Instead, the film was lead by British newcomer Robert Bierman who held previous experience working on commercials and short films such as The Rocking Horse Winner and The Dumb Waiter. This sudden departure however also prompted the then cast Nicolas Cage to drop out after his agent pressured him stating \\"this was not a good movie to make after Moonstruck.\\" His departure was short lived however and Cage's \\"outrageously unbridled performance,\\" was destined for the screen. An enthusiastic employer of the Method Acting technique, Cage \\"took a highly surrealistic approach,\\" to Loew. Apart from his “pseudo-Trannsylvanian dialect,” scenes of Cage screaming the alphabet, eating cockroaches, and ranting \\"I'm a vampire!\\" shocked viewers and critics alike. The original script called for Loew to eat a raw egg but Cage decided a cockroach would be more effective claiming it would \\"shock the audience.\\" This shock was further extended to a couple of real homeless people who Cage ran into on the streets of Manhattan as he pleaded with them to drive a stake through his heart as Bierman and crew shot from afar. Physicality played a central role in the creation of this character for Cage who in several terrifying scenes sought to see \\"how big [he] could get [his] eyes.\\" This was then furthered with scenes of Cage jumping on tables, sprinting across the office, and many frantic hand gestures which he claims were \\"extremely choreographed.\\" While many such as Hal Hinson of The Washington Post criticized this style of \\"scorched-earth acting,\\" it cemented the film as a cult classic and become the source of many internet memes. Release Vampire's Kiss was released June 2, 1989. It grossed $725,131 in the U.S. It was released on home video in August 1990. MGM released it on DVD in August 2002, and Scream Factory released it on Blu-ray in February 2015. Reception Vampire's Kiss was considered a commercial flop upon its initial release but has developed a cult following since that time. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 61% of 23 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.89/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"He's a vampire! He's a vampire! He's a vampire!\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Variety wrote, \\"Cage's over-the- top performance generates little sympathy for the character, so it’s tough to be interested in him as his personality disorder worsens.\\" Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, \\"[T]he film is dominated and destroyed by Mr. Cage's chaotic, self-indulgent performance.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a sleek, outrageous dark comedy that's all the funnier for constantly teetering on the brink of sheer tastelessness and silliness.\\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called the film \\"stone-dead bad, incoherently bad\\", but said that Cage's overacting must be seen to be believed. Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer called it an \\"imaginative, if warped, black comedy\\" that \\"succeeds as a wicked allegory of What Men Want\\". Reviewing the film on Blu-ray, Anthony Arrigo of Bloody Disgusting wrote, \\"The film may not work very well as a comedy, but there's enough of a dark derangement present to make it almost unsettling.\\" Furthermore, Peter Travers from the Rolling Stone argues that the film doesn’t need further criticism but rather “a stake through the heart.” See also *Vampire film References External links  * 1989 films 1980s black comedy films American films American black comedy films English- language films Vampire comedy films Films set in New York City Films shot in New York City Films set in the 1980s Films scored by Colin Towns 1989 directorial debut films 1989 comedy films ","title":"Vampire's Kiss"},{"id":"4045261","title":"What's Wrong with This Picture?

Summary Platonic archetypes begin to manifest themselves outside a small Hertfordshire town, wreaking havoc and drawing to the surface the spiritual strengths and flaws of individual characters. Their focus is the home of Mr Berringer, the leader of a group interested in magical symbolism who falls into a coma after contact with the first archetype unloosed, the lion of the title. Other powers follow this one and cut off the town from the rest of the world that they will inevitably absorb and reshape. Among those overcome and destroyed by the raw powers they encounter are two members of the group, Mr Foster and Miss Wilmot, whose motivation is ultimately selfish. A chance visitor to the group, the academic author Damaris Tighe, narrowly escapes the same fate but is saved at the last moment by her cousin and fiancé, Anthony Durrant. She then sets out to locate Anthony’s friend, Quentin Sabot, who had been with Anthony when the lion first appeared and has now fled into the countryside, overcome with terror. Meanwhile, with the help of another group member, Mr Richardson, who also has the inner strength to withstand the angelical archetypes, Anthony is enabled to understand the process that has been unleashed by Berringer. Together they plan to counter it and reverse the threat. Its next phase has already started and some of the town’s buildings begin to collapse as Berringer’s house is swallowed in a column of unquenchable flame. Armed with the secret names of the archetypes from a grimoire, Anthony summons them back to their point of focus while Richardson neutralizes the fire by walking into it. Critical reception T. S. Eliot described Williams’ novels in this genre as “supernatural thrillers”.Anna Bugajska, \\"Disordered Beauty\\" in Charles Williams' The Place of the Lion, Academia, p.1 Anthony Boucher and J.

History It was founded in Buffalo, New York in 1865 but relocated to Erie, Pennsylvania. In 1872, the company was known as the Derrick and Felgemaker Pipe Organ Company. During the 1870s, the company employed over 55 workers and had $75,000 worth of capital. The firm produced between 15 and 20 organs per week(citation needed). Specialties of the company included church organs and portable pipe organs for small churches, schools and residential parlors. By 1878 the company was renamed as the A.B. Felgemaker Company, relocating the factory to larger facilities in 1888 and 1890. At the invitation of Mr. Felgemaker, German organ maker Anton Gottfried moved to Erie in 1894, where he leased space from the Felgemaker plant. The A.B. Felgemaker Company remained in business until 1917. Several workers from the Felgemaker Company, including Gottfried, joined to form the Organ Supply Industries in Erie, which is today North America's largest pipe organ manufacturer and supply house. The company produced organs until 1918, when it ceased operations. The company's service agreements and pending contracts were then assumed by the Tellers-Kent Organ Company. Surviving organs Organs produced by the company are still in use at Lawrence University, Appleton Wisconsin, St. John's Lutheran Church, Erie, Pennsylvania, Crawford Memorial United Methodist Church, Bronx, New York, Trinity Episcopal Church, Iowa City, Iowa, St. John's Episcopal Church, Canandaigua, New York, First Congregational Church, St. Johns, Michigan, First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Sacred Heart Music Center, Duluth, Minnesota, Spencerport United Methodist Church, Spencerport, New York, and Prince of Peace Evangelical Lutheran Church, Bangor, Pennsylvania, Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church, Minersville, Pennsylvania has a A.B. Felgemaker that was installed in 1906, Zion Lutheran Church, Everett, Pennsylvania has a A.B. Felgemaker Organ that was installed in 1903. An additional organ exists at Emmanuel Lutheran in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, however, the organ has been rebuilt four times since Felgemaker's presence and its remaining extent is indeterminant. Capitol Hill Seventh-day Adventist Church in Washington, DC maintains one of the original Felgemaker pipe organs, produced before 1917. Two still exist in Buffalo at the former St. Agnes RC Church (relocated from Sacred Heart RC in Buffalo) and Emmanual Temple SDA, originally St. Stephen's Evangelical. Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in Taneytown, Maryland, has a Felgemaker pipe organ built in 1897. It was completely restored in 1987 by the Columbia Organ Works and is still in weekly Sunday service. Emmanuel Catholic Church in Dayton, Ohio originally dedicated its three-division Felgemaker pipe organ in 1887. Since then, the organ has undergone multiple major renovations and additions, most recently in 2015. Formal re-dedication of the Emmanuel Felgemaker organ is scheduled for November 11, 2016. Freemasons'Hall in Indianapolis has 6 matching Felgamaker Pipe Organs installed in 1908. They are all in unrestored, playable condition. The pipe organ at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Santa Cruz, CA is based on an A. B. Felgemaker Co. organ (Opus 506, 1889) with additional pipes and Zimbelstern added by Stuart Goodwin & Co. (Opus 10, 1988) after moving it from its previous home in Ohio.http://database.organsociety.org/OrganDetails.php?OrganID=6706 The organ is in active use at the 5:00 Saturday and 7:00 and 8:30 Sunday Masses. An A.B. Felgemaker still exists in working order at the former M.E. Richmond Ave. Church at West Ferry Street & Olmsted Circle and will be cleaned and remain in working order. A.B. Felgemaker Organ Co. built an organ in 1882 for a Lutheran church in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. After 1905 the organ was moved to St. Cecilia's Catholic Church, Hubbell, Michigan. In 2011 the organ was rebuilt and moved to St. Albert the Great Catholic University Parish, Houghton, Michigan, where it is in regular use for mass, organ instruction, and recitals.Dalquist, Janet Anuta (May 2012). \\"An Update on the Organs of the Keweenaw\\".

R. S. Mead. George Robert Stow Mead (22 March 1863 in Peckham, SurreyGRO index of births 1863 Q2 vol 1d page 525 Camberwell – 28 September 1933 in London)Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Clare Goodrick-Clarke (eds), G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest, North Atlantic Books, 2005, p. 32. was an English historian, writer, editor, translator, and an influential member of the Theosophical Society, as well as the founder of the Quest Society. His scholarly works dealt mainly with the Hermetic and Gnostic religions of Late Antiquity, and were exhaustive for the time period. Birth and family Mead was born in Peckham, Surrey, England to British Army Colonel Robert Mead and his wife Mary (née Stow), who had received a traditional education at Rochester Cathedral School. Mead, a highly intuitive and insightful scholar, whose literary activities fall into the latter part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century must be regarded as a pioneer of the first order in the field of Gnostic and Hermetic studies. As the late poet and esoteric student Kenneth Rexroth accurately stated in his introduction to the late 1950s University Books edition of Mead's Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, the only reason for Mead's continued neglect on the part of many academicians is the fact that he was a Theosophist. When in 1887 the redoubtable Madame Blavatsky settled in London, the young Mead joined the company of her close associates. In her circle he learned of the profound mysteries of the Gnostics and of the votaries of Hermes, soon becoming an indefatigable worker in his capacity of translator of Gnostic and Hermetic writings. Admittedly, many of his translations were from other modern languages as he was not trained in Coptic.See the Bibliographical Note in the Dover edition of his Pistis Sophia, which states \\"Mead's English Translation does not derive from the original Coptic, but from the 1851 Latin translation by M. G. Scwartze, the 1895 French translation by E. Amelineau, and the 1905 German translation by Carl Schmidt.\\" Education at Cambridge University Having shown academic potential, Mead began studying mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge. Eventually shifting his education towards the study of Classics, he gained much knowledge of Greek and Latin. In 1884 he completed a BA degree; in the same year he became a public school master. He received an MA degree in 1926.http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi- bin/search-2018.pl?sur=mead&suro;=w&fir;=George+Robert+Stow&firo;=c&cit;=&cito;=c&c;=all&z;=all&tex;=&sye;=&eye;=&col;=all&maxcount;=50 Activity with the Theosophical Society While still at Cambridge University Mead read Esoteric Buddhism (1883) by Alfred Percy Sinnett. This comprehensive theosophical account of the Eastern religion prompted Mead to contact two theosophists in London named Bertam Keightly and Mohini Chatterji, which eventually led him to join Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's Theosophical Society in 1884. In 1889 he abandoned his teaching profession to become Blavatsky's private secretary, and also became a joint-secretary of the Esoteric Section (E.S.) of the Theosophical Society, reserved for those deemed more advanced. Mead received Blavatsky's Six Esoteric Instructions and other teachings at 22 meetings headed by Blavatsky which were only attended by the Inner Group of the Theosophical Society. It was because of the intimacy Mead felt with the Inner Group that he married Laura Cooper in 1899. Contributing intellectually to the Theosophical Society, at first most interested in Eastern religions, he quickly became more and more attracted to Western esotericism in religion and philosophy, particularly Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism, although his scholarship and publications continued to engage with Eastern religion. Making many contributions to the Theosophical Society's Lucifer as joint editor, he eventually became the sole editor of The Theosophical Review in 1907 (as Lucifer was renamed in 1897). As of February 1909 Mead and some 700 members of the Theosophical Society's British Section resigned in protest at Annie Besant's reinstatement of Charles Webster Leadbeater to membership in the society. Leadbeater had been a prominent member of the Theosophical Society until he was accused in 1906 of teaching masturbation to, and sexually touching,https://blavatskytheosophy.com/the-case-against-c-w-leadbeater/ the sons of some American Theosophists under the guise of occult training. While this prompted Mead's resignation, his frustration at the dogmatism of the Theosophical Society may also have been a major contributor to his break after 25 years. The Quest Society In March 1909 Mead founded the Quest Society, composed of 150 defectors of the Theosophical Society and 100 other new members. Very intentionally this new society was planned to be an undogmatic approach to the comparative study and investigation of religion, philosophy, and science. The Quest Society had lectures at Kensington Town Hall in central London but its most focused effort was in its publishing of The Quest: A Quarterly Review which ran from 1909–1931 with many contributors. Influence Notable persons influenced by Mead include Ezra Pound, W.B. Yeats, Hermann Hesse, Kenneth Rexroth, and Robert Duncan. The seminal influence of G.R.S. Mead on Carl Gustav Jung, confirmed by the scholar of Gnosticism Gilles Quispel, a friend of Jung's, has been documented by several scholars. The popularity of a 20th-century Theosophical or esoteric interpretation of \\"gnosis\\" and the \\"Gnostics\\" led to an influential conception among scholars of an essential doctrinal and practising commonality among the various groups deemed \\"Gnostic,\\" which has been criticised by scholars such as Michael Allen Williams in his book Rethinking Gnosticism and by Karen L. King in recent decades.  Works  *Address read at H.P.

Fruit Form Description D. viscosa is a shrub growing to tall, rarely a small tree to tall. The leaves are variable in shape: generally obovate but some of them are lanceolate, often sessile,Dodonaea viscosoides Berry, U. S. Geol. Survey Prof. Paper, Volume 84, page 142, 1914. long and broad, alternate in arrangement, and secrete a resinous substance. Many specimens have a pointed or rounded apex. Leaf base is extended. Leaf texture is leathery, tough, but also pliable. Midribs are medium becoming less visible close to the apex. Secondary veins are thin, generally indistinct; Veins: often 6 to 10 pairs, indifferently opposite, subopposite, and alternate, camptodrome. Venation branches from the midrib at different angles, which may vary from 12° to 70°. The basal veins are very ascending in some plants: the angle of divergence may be close to 45°. The basal secondary venation branches from a point near the base of the main vein and becomes parallel with the leaf margin, with the distance of 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters from the edges. Margins are usually toothed or undulating. The remaining secondary veins lay at regular intervals with flowers usually growing at the branches’ ends. The flowers are yellow to orange-red and produced in panicles about in length. The flowers may be only male or female ones, and one plant bears either male or female flowers. However, sometimes they are observed to bear flowers of both sexes. The pollen is transported by anemophily. It is believed that D. viscosa flowers lack petals during evolution to increase exposure to the wind. The fruit is a capsule broad, red ripening brown, with two to four wings. Fruits Common names The common name hopbush is used for D. viscosa specifically but also for the genus as a whole. In the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, this plant is called virāli (விராலி). Australian common names include: broad leaf hopbush, candlewood, giant hopbush, narrow leaf hopbush, sticky hopbush, native hop bush, soapwood, switchsorrel, wedge leaf hopbush, and native hop.Robson, P. J. 1993. Checklist of Australian Trees. Additional common names include: aalii and ‘a‘ali‘i-ku ma kua and ‘a‘ali‘i ku makani in the Hawaiian language; akeake (New Zealand); lampuaye (Guam); mesechelangel (Palau); chirca (Uruguay, Argentina); Xayramad (Somalia); romerillo (Sonora, Mexico); jarilla (southern Mexico); hayuelo (Colombia); ch'akatea (Bolivia); casol caacol (Seri); ghoraskai (Afghanistan). Uses The wood is extremely tough and durable. In New Zealand, where it is the heaviest of any native wood, the Māori have traditionally used it for making weapons, carved walking staves, axe-handles, and weights on drill shafts. D. viscosa (also known as “hopbush”) is used by the people from the western part of the island of New Guinea, Southeast Asia, West Africa and Brazil for house building and as firewood. Its leaves may also be used as plasters for wounds. Native Hawaiians made pou (house posts), laau melomelo (fishing lures), and ōō (digging sticks) from aalii wood and a red dye from the fruit. The cultivar 'Purpurea', with purple foliage, is widely grown as a garden shrub. Dodonaea viscosa easily occupies open areas and secondary forest, and is resistant to salinity, drought and pollution. It can be used for dune stabilization, remediation of polluted lands and for reforestation. The plant is tolerant to strong winds, and therefore is commonly used as hedge, windbreak, and decorative shrub. The Seri use the plant medicinally. It was also used to stimulate lactation in mothers, as a dysentery treatment, to cure digestive system disorders, skin problems and rheumatism in Africa and Asia. In New Guinea, people use it as incense for funerals. In the past D. viscosa was used instead of hops for beer brewing by Australians (as reflected in the name “hopbush”). Systematics It is identified that D. viscosa split into two intraspecific groups (group I, II) in the Pleistocene 1.1–2.1 Ma (million years ago) (95% Highest Posterior Density, HPD). These two intraspecific groups are distributed differently within Australia. Group I plants are strandline shrubs growing from north- eastern Queensland to the New South Wales border. This clade has a number of genetically divergent lineages (I:a,b,c,d,e,f,g,). It is identified that subclade Ib shared a last common ancestor with subclade Ia in the mid- Pleistocene, 0.5–1.2 Ma. The Group II plants of D. viscosa is present almost everywhere on the continent. Group II has at least three evolutionary lineages (II a, b and c), which distributions generally overlap. According to West these subspecies have morphological intergradation, particularly in the higher-rainfall regions of Australia, but not in the arid zone, where they generally overlap. There is also a hypothesis of ongoing gene flow between D. procumbens and D. viscosa’s Group II resulting from hybridization events of two populations in central regions of South Australia. The Group II members are believed to disperse in the mid-Pleistocene (0.5–1.2 Ma) from mainland Australia to New Zealand.

Jacq. subsp. viscosa Botanical synonyms * D. eriocarpa Sm. * D. sandwicensis Sherff * D. stenocarpa Hillebr. Cultivation Dodonaea viscosa can be grown from seeds. However, pre- treatment of the seed in very hot water may be needed. The plant can also be cultivated by taking cuttings. Sometimes this method is also used to obtain female plants with their winged fruits for the aesthetic value. Hopbush can survive long dry periods and is easily cultivated without heavy feeding.

The congregation was founded in 1848 by George Hendric Houghton and worshiped in a home at 48 East 29th Street until the church was built and consecrated in 1849. The church was designed in the early English Neo-Gothic style; the architect has not been identified. The sanctuary is set back from the street behind a garden which creates a facsimile of the English countryside and which has long been an oasis for New Yorkers, who relax in the garden, pray in the chapel, or enjoy free weekday concerts in the main church. The complex has grown somewhat haphazardly over the years, and for this reason it is sometimes called the \\"Holy Cucumber Vine\\". The sanctuary had a guildhall, transepts, and a tower added to it in 1852, and the lych-gate, designed by Frederick Clarke Withers, was built in 1896. Chapels were added in 1906 (lady chapel) and 1908 (mortuary chapel). The Edwin Booth memorial stained glass window (1898) is by John LaFarge. In 1967, the church was designated a New York City landmark, p.80 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  Early years  The church has been a leader of the Anglo-Catholic movement within the Episcopal Church from its founding. While this movement is often associated with elaborate worship, it also has stressed service to the poor and oppressed from its earliest days. In 1863, during the Civil War Draft Riots, Houghton gave sanctuary to African Americans who were under attack, filling up the church's sanctuary, schoolroom, library and vestry. When rioters showed up at the church, Houghton turned them away and dispersed them by saying, \\"You white devils, you! Do you know nothing of the spirit of Christ?\\", p.131  Ties to the theater  Actors were among the social outcasts whom Houghton befriended. In 1870, William T. Sabine, the rector of the nearby Church of the Atonement, which is no longer extant, refused to conduct funeral services for an actor named George Holland, suggesting, \\"I believe there is a little church around the corner where they do that sort of thing.\\" Joseph Jefferson, a fellow actor who was trying to arrange Holland's burial, exclaimed, \\"If that be so, God bless the little church around the corner!\\" and the church began a longstanding association with the theater. P. G. Wodehouse, when living in Greenwich Village as a young writer of novels and lyrics for musicals, married his wife Ethel at the Little Church in September 1914. Subsequently, Wodehouse would set most of his fictionalized weddings at the church; and the hit musical Sally that he wrote with Jerome Kern and Guy Bolton ended with the company singing, in tribute to the Bohemian congregation: \\"Dear little, dear little Church 'Round the Corner / Where so many lives have begun, / Where folks without money see nothing that's funny / In two living cheaper than one.\\" In 1923, the Episcopal Actors' Guild held its first meeting at Transfiguration. Such theatrical greats as Basil Rathbone, Tallulah Bankhead, Peggy Wood, Joan Fontaine, Rex Harrison, Barnard Hughes, and Charlton Heston have served as officers or council members of the guild. The Little Church's association with the theatre continued in the 1970s, when it hosted the Joseph Jefferson Theatre Company, which gave starts to actors such as Armand Assante, Tom Hulce, and Rhea Perlman. As well as being a guild officer, Sir Rex Harrison was memorialized at the church upon his death in 1990. Maggie Smith, Brendan Gill, and Harrison's sons, Carey and Noel, spoke at the service.  Recent history  The Little Church Around the Corner is known for the long service of its rectors: in the 150 years from its founding to 1998, there were only five. The Reverend Jackson Harvelle Randolph Ray (June 11, 1886 – June 1963), for instance, was rector from 1923 to 1963. The parish is currently under the rectorate of Father John David van Dooren, who was called as rector in 2017.  Music program  The church has long been associated with a program of free music performances. The Anglican tradition of a men's and boys' choir has been maintained with special music for concerts and summer services provided by a choir of mixed voices. In 1988, the Arnold Schwartz Memorial organ, a new tracker pipe organ, was built and installed at the church by C. B. Fisk, Inc.\\"Church of the Transfiguration\\", NYC AGO In popular culture * A key scene—a wedding between characters played by Neil Hamilton and Mary Brian—in the 1925 Herbert Brenon–directed silent film The Street of Forgotten Men was shot at the church.The Street of Forgotten Men (filmography page) * The church is alluded to at least twice in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, as \\"tin choorch round the coroner\\" (67.13) and \\"ye litel church rond ye corner\\" (533.23–4). * In 1986, the church was featured in an episode of The Equalizer titled \\"Shades of Darkness\\". * In Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, Allen attends a concert in the main sanctuary while attempting to convert to Catholicism.
