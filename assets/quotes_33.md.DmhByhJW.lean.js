It became a subject of public discussion in 2014.VHP to hold 'ghar wapsi' for 4,000 Muslims in Ayodhya in January, Times of India, 24 December 2014 The Bharatiya Janata Party's Yogi Adityanath has claimed this campaign would continue unless conversions to other religions are banned altogether in the country. The Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh organised several Ghar Wapsi events in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Goa. The Indian Express reported that Scheduled Caste Manjhi families demanded better facilities along with education and healthcare before they converted. In a Supreme Court judgment, the judges ruled that reconversion to Hinduism will not prevent a person from accessing quota benefits and adopt the caste of his forefathers. The bench further held that \\"the Scheduled Caste persons belonging to Hindu religion, who had embraced Christianity with some kind of hope or aspiration, have remained socially, educationally and economically backward.\\"  Etymology  The word ghar is of Hindi origin which means \\"home\\". The word wapsi means \\"to return\\". This term indicates the belief held by the organisations facilitating such programmes that most of the Muslims and Christians in India have descended from Hindus, and hence are returning to their \\"home\\" through reconversion.  Major instances  Telangana and Andhra Pradesh More than 8,000 people in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh converted to Hinduism from July 2014 - December 2014 under the Ghar Wapsi programme. According to a VHP official, 1,200 people converted to Hinduism in a Ghar Wapsi event in Hyderabad. In October 2019, 500 Christian Dalits in Andhra Pradesh were convinced to become Hindu and promise to never go to church again. Jharkhand In April 2017, at least 53 tribal Christian families converted to Hinduism as part of the RSS's \\"Christianity-free\\" block campaign in Arki, Jharkhand. And at least seven other Christian families underwent a Shuddhikaran (purification ceremony) in Kochasindhri village. Punjab Between 2011 to 2014, about 8,000 Christians in Punjab were converted back to Sikhism. Most of the reconversion was done in the Hoshiarpur district, followed by Amritsar and Batala. West Bengal More than 100 tribal Christians were converted to Hinduism in the West Bengal's Birbhum district. Uttar Pradesh In May 2017, RSS performed conversion of at least 22 Muslims, including women and children, into Hinduism in a secretive ceremony at an Aryasamaj Temple in Ambedkar Nagar district of Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh. Tripura In January 2019, 96 Tribal families that converted to Christianity 9 years prior, underwent Ghar Wapsi to reconvert back to Hinduism. The event took place in Kailashahar in Unakoti district in Tripura. The event was done by the Hindu Jagaran Mancham, an affiliate of the RSS, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Kerala In 2015, about 35 people were reportedly converted to Hinduism at an event organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in Alappuzha. In 2015, 35 people converted to Hinduism in Kottayam district. They were Dalit families who had converted to Christianity a few generations back. Tamil Nadu In 2015, first ghar wapsi happened in Tamil Nadu where 18 Dalit Christians reconverted to Hinduism by a ceremony done by the Hindu Makkal Katchi. Gujarat In 2020, 144 tribal Hindus who converted to Christianity many years ago converted back to Hinduism in Dang district, Gujarat by the Agniveer organisation. Reception Many Hindus in India, especially those affiliated with Hindutva-oriented organisations such as the BJP and RSS, are supportive of Ghar Wapsi efforts to counter what they perceive as mass conversions to Islam and Christianity and to a lesser extent Buddhism (neo-Buddhism), among Dalit Hindus in India. Some secular groups and political parties are critical of Ghar Wapsi, especially when it is done with the state's support, as they say that it threatens freedom of religion in the country.

Examples include: * Marriage or living together: When people marry they often transfer the property into the names of both parties. * Divorce or separation: When a couple divorce or separate, property is typically transferred, sometime with compensation. Restructuring a joint mortgage requires the mortgage company's consent. * Tax planning: Property owners may transfer equity to their children or other family members to manage their tax liabilities. Transferring equity can be complex, involving land registry applications and stamp duty land tax forms.

Parish History The site of present-day Rizal (formerly Malaueg) was a significant mission center for the Dominican missionaries spreading Christianity on the Cagayan Valley and the foot of the Cordillera mountain range. The Dominican priests officially established Malaueg in 1607 and laid the foundations of the present church in November 26, 1617. Architecture The church, made mostly of fired bricks, is unique among other Spanish-era churches established by the Dominicans in the Cagayan valley region due to its smaller size and novel design. The church's brickwork has been described as ‚Äúof free use‚Äù and that it exudes an earthy feel. Attention on the fa√ßade is focused on the main arched portal which is framed by a plastered white wall capped with a small triangular pediment. The main doorway is flanked with saints‚Äô niches.

The Houston also participated in the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February before being sunk in the Battle of Sunda Strait on 28 February ‚Äì 1 March 1942, along with the Australian light cruiser and the Dutch destroyer HNLMS Evertsen. 696 crew members died; the remaining 368 were captured and made prisoners of war by the Japanese.\\"U.S.S. Houston\\" http://www.perthone.com/phou.html, accessed 29 Dec 2014 Burma railway Map of the Burma Railway The captured American soldiers and sailors were held for seven months in a prison camp on Java along with thousands of Dutch, British, and Australian soldiers. In October 1942, they were taken to Singapore and 668 of them then continued onward to Moulmein, Burma. In Singapore about 140 of the Americans with industrial skills were separated from the main body and sent to Japan to work there.Marcello, pp 297-298 The Americans were part of a group of about 300,000 workers, mostly Southeast Asians but including 66,000 POWs, put to work building the railroad that would cross the mountains for a distance of between Burma and Thailand. Before World War II, the British had contemplated building the railway, but had rejected the idea. For more than a year, the Asian laborers and POWs worked on the railway using only hand tools. It was completed on October 23, 1943.MacArthur, Brian (2005), Surviving the Sword, New York: Random House, pp. 43-46, 143 Conditions during the construction were brutal. The POWs and other workers suffered from insufficient food, poor medical care, murderous guards, and heavy work quotas. Tens of thousands died during the construction, including 133 Americans, 19.6 percent of the total number of American POWs who worked on the Burma railway. By the end of the construction only about 40 of the Americans were still capable of manual labor.Marcello, pp. 299-319 After the completion of the railroad, the survivors of the Lost Battalion were separated, some remaining to maintain the railroad, others being assigned to work in Thailand or Vietnam, and some sent to Japan to labor in coal mines on Hokkaido. 18 Americans were killed on June 24, 1944 when an American submarine sank the Japanese freighter on which they were traveling en route to Japan.Marcello, pp. 317-320 E Battery The 99 men of E Battery were captured and held prisoner separately from the other personnel of the lost battalion. Captured in early March 1942, E Battery was housed initially in Surabaja with Dutch, British, and Australian soldiers. In October 1942 they were sent to Changi Prison in Singapore on board an overcrowded cargo ship and in November they were sent by ship to Fukuoka, Japan to work in the shipyards there. In June 1945 they were moved again to labor in coal mines on Kyushu and remained there until the end of the war in August. Ninety-one of the members of E Battery survived the war.Crager, Kelly E. \\"'God Knows What's Going to Happen to Us' The Lost Battery of Texas's 'Lost Battalion\\", The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 112, No. 2 (July 2008), pp. 1-32. Downloaded from JSTOR The Lost Battalion is found American authorities had no information about the fate of the lost battalion until September 16, 1944. On that date, American submarines sank two Japanese freighters which were transporting more than 2,000 British and Australian POWs to Japan. The surviving POWs told the U.S. that American soldiers from the Second Battalion and sailors from USS Houston had worked with them on the Burma railroad.Marcello, p. 293 After the end of the war in August 1945, the POWs of the lost battalion were repatriated from their various locations to the United States. Of 534 personnel of the 2nd battalion taken prisoner, 86 (16%) died in captivity. Of 368 navy and Marine Corps personnel taken prisoner, 77 (21%) died in captivity. Five commissioned officers (3 percent of the total dead) were among those dying in captivity. About 10 percent of the prisoners were officers.\\"Lost Battalion Association\\", http://www/texasmilitaryforcesmuseum.org/lostbattalion/stats.htm, accessed 1 Jan 2015.

It also runs 4 community hospitals in addition to providing community services in Brent, Ealing and Harrow. The trust employs 8,590 staff across all its sites, and in 2016/17 had 141,355 attendances to its Emergency Department, and 80,756 elective inpatient and day case admissions. In 2018 the trust decided not to submit a bid for a 10-year contract to provide most ‚Äúout of hospital services‚Äù to Ealing Clinical Commissioning Group ‚Äì services which they had been providing. The chief executive told staff that it was not possible to provide a quality service for the money on offer, despite the sum being offered being higher than the sum the Trust was already receiving for delivering the services. Ultimately three bidders participated in the procurement and the services were awarded to a consortium led by West London Mental Health NHS Trust.

Imao was named National Artist of the Philippines for Sculpture in 2006. A Taus≈´g, Imao is the first Moro to receive the recognition. Aside from being a sculptor, Imao is also a painter, photographer, ceramist, cultural researcher, documentary film maker, writer, and a patron of Philippine Muslim art and culture.  Early life  Abdulmari Imao was born on 14 January 1936 in Siasi, Sulu. Imao spent most of his childhood in the town of Pata, also in Sulu. His family came from a generation of or boat makers dating back to the precolonial era. At the age of nine, Imao began to show interests for the arts. Imao etched trophies with the shape of a swimmer atop a pedestal for the swimmers in Sulu. At that time, swimmers from Jolo were the best bets of the country for the Olympics. Imao finished high school in 1956. During the same year, the Philippine Navy held a floating exhibit named LST which hosted works of Filipino artists, Fernando Amorsolo, Botong Francisco and Vicente Manansala. Imao conversed with Tomas Bernardo, who was in-charge of the exhibit, about painting and asked if Imao was into the discipline. Imao presented Bernardo some of his works who later took Imao to Manila.  Career and education  Abdulmari Imao wrote to then President Ramon Magsaysay to seek a study grant. Jose Maria Ansaldo, aide to the President, helped Imao enter college at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City. Imao entered as a pensionado of the Commission on National Integration. Among his mentors at the university were Guillermo Tolentino and Napoleon Abueva, who preceded him as National Artists. Imao graduated from the university with the degree Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture. In 1960, Abdulmari Imao entered the University of Kansas in the United States as a Smith Mundt and Fulbright Scholar. Imao was able to qualify for the top 20 slots of the scholarship. In 1962, Imao earned his Masters of Fine Arts in Sculpture, major in Metal Brass Casting. From 1962‚Äì1963 at the Rhode Island School of Design, Imao honed his craft as a scholar taking Creative Sculptor in Ceramic Technology. Imao also entered the Columbia University in New York City under the Columbia Faculty Scholarship in the tuition of Dr. Lloyd Burden. who developed the first color processing for Kodak. Imao studied documentary motion picture and photography at the university. In 1963, Imao received the New York Museum of Modern Art Grant to Europe and Scandinavia becoming the first Asian recipient of the grant. On 9 June 2006, Imao was named with the National Artist of the Philippines for Sculpture. Imao was also recognized as a brass-making consultant of the United Nations  Style and Technique  Abdulmari Imao is known for using the okir, sarimanok and the naga as motifs in his artworks and is credited for popularizing the motifs to the Filipino national consciousness. Imao draws inspiration from Taus≈´g and Maranao art. Imao's Islamic faith is also a source of inspiration in his art as evidenced in his sculptures composed of elements of Allah's name through Arabic calligraphy.  Personal life  Abdulmari Imao was married to Grace de Leon, an art dealer from Santo Tomas, Pampanga. They had four sons.  Death  Imao died on 16 December 2014 at the age of 78 at his home in Marikina. Imao was suspected of dying due to heart attack but his family later released a statement through Imao's daughter-in-law, Cielo Imao, that he died in his sleep. A traditional state necrological service and tributes, which is usually given to National Artists, was accorded to Imao on 21 December at the Cultural Center of the Philippines' Main Theater. Imao was later interred at the Libingan ng mga Bayani at noon.

Paul has been framed and decides to go to Switzerland to find out who is really behind this. He has a daughter, Brigitte, who is at finishing school and thinks he is a shipbuilder.

Vadim agreed provided his then-wife Brigitte Bardot was cast as the female lead and if Michel Boisrond, Ren√© Clair's first assistant director, would direct. Vadim later wrote \\"for the first time, Brigitte played a character written for her, in modern language; and she had a classically trained director who was making his first film.\\" He called the movie \\"a French equivalent of a Doris Day movie but with a bolder, more liberated edge.\\" Reception Box office The film was a box-office hit in France, being the 12th most popular movie of the year. It was slightly more popular than And God Created Woman which Vadim directed later that year.Box office figures in France for 1956 at Box Office Story Critical The Observer wrote that the director \\"has learnt the knack of raising a simple laugh, not yet the art of touching heart and mind.\\" The Los Angeles Times praised the \\"tight, high speed direction.\\" The New York Times wrote that the film: > Is full of slapstick and clumsy farce, and some oldish and splashy dance > numbers.

He tries to send her to a convent but she escapes to Paris to live with her brother. On the train she meets Daniel, a journalist. Agnes thinks her brother is a rich artist but he's actually a poor guide in the Balzac Museum. Agnes needs money and enters an amateur striptease contest.

I changed the plot and wrote an amusing, romantic and sexy story.\\" Reception The film was the 20th most popular film at the French box office. It was released before Bardot's film And God Created Woman, which was the 13th most popular and Naughty Girl which was 12th. It was released in the US as Mademoiselle Striptease. The Washington Post called it \\"one of the nicest comedies of the summer.\\" The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a most delightful, naughty and very funny comedy... Bardot strikes pure gold... it's strictly a fun show that doesn't try to prove a thing.\\" It was also released in the US as Please Mr Balzac. The New York Times said the \\"sole excuse for this singularly unfrothy and unfunny romantic comedy is Brigitte Bardot....[a] thin, old-fashioned, slightly smutty and extremely dull charade... The picture is pretty awful.

The song \\"Compassionate sister\\", which was created by Uzeyir Hajibeyov and Samad Vurgun in the Second World War, was read by the singer before the Azerbaijani soldiers on the frontline. Hero became an embodiment of the Azerbaijani woman. Noted particularly for her dastgah performance, which excelled other female dastgah performances, she also sang Bayaty-Shiraz, Karabakh shikastasi and other mugham varieties. Gadimova toured twenty two foreign countries. She was awarded the Sharaf Order and Shohrat Order. Life Gadimova was born in Baku. Her father Babish hailed from the village of G√ºlablƒ±, but settled in Baku. Having graduated from medical school, Gadimova entered the Baku Music Academy and completed studies there in 1941. Among her music mentors were Huseyngulu Sarabski, Khan Shushinski and Seyid Shushinski. During World War II and Nagorno-Karabakh War, Gadimova performed patriotic songs for soldiers. At the age of 22 Gadimova married Gadir Islamzadeh, who was older by 24 years. They eventually separated after eight years. In the 1950s Gadimova was already a popular singer. In 1954 she was awarded the title of the People's Artist of Azerbaijan. Gadimova died after prolonged illness at the age of 82, having dreamed of performing Karabakh shikastasi in the Armenian-occupied Agdam District of Azerbaijan. Her voice is lyric-coloratric soprano. Along with ADF's soloist (from 1941), she was also a master of the ADOBT in 1957-1962. Sara Gadimova had a great influence in the education of artists such as H√ºseyinqulu Sarabski, Khan Shushinski and Seyid Shushinski. As a worthy successor to his predecessors, she remained loyal to the tradition of classical singing until the end of his life.In the Azerbaijan State Opera and Ballet Theater, Sara Gadimova's name, performed at leading parties, was remembered by Leyli and Asli's paintings created on the opera scene. \\"Bayati-Shiraz\\", \\"Shur\\", \\"Shahnaz\\", \\"Qatar\\", \\"Mahur-hindi\\", \\"Foreign Seagah\\" mugams and various Azerbaijani folk songs performed by him in his history are written in golden letters. Performed by singer, \\"Garabagh Shikestesi\\" plays a special place in the history of Azerbaijani music. Sara Gadimova, who deeply fascinates folk music, is one of the great artists who enrich our national musical treasure, playing a decent place in the Azerbaijani khanate school with deep historical roots, traditions and contributed to its development. The ability to penetrate the inner world of the listener, and the ability to create a strong emotional effect, was characteristic of Sara Gadimova's creativity. The main source of his singing, which has been around for more than sixty years, is to serve the culture of Azerbaijan. Sara Gadimova's lifestyle characteristic of our national music will always be an example for the young Khanand generation. Sara Gadimova, who has repeatedly represented our national culture in foreign countries, has drawn Azerbaijani folk music to representatives of different nationalities and was deeply sympathetic to the most prestigious scenes. Commemoration On 30 May 2007 a commemorative plaque dedicated to Gadimova was unveiled on 27 Uzeyir Hajibayov Street in Baku, where she lived.

As of 2017 it has one active chapter. History Delta Kappa Phi was founded as a professional textile fraternity by six students at the Philadelphia Textile Institute (later Philadelphia University and now Thomas Jefferson University) in 1899. Though its founders initially planned to seek affiliation with a national fraternity, that plan was soon shelved and the organization expanded to other schools, focusing on institutions with textile programs. Its second chapter was chartered in 1902 at the Lowell Technological Institute (now the University of Massachusetts Lowell, or UMass Lowell), and the organization gradually established chapters at New Bedford Institute of Textiles and Technology (now part of UMass Darthmouth), the Rhode Island School of Design, North Carolina State University, and Georgia Tech. The Fraternity was incorporated in the State of Massachusetts in 1905. By 1979 the fraternity had contracted to just its UMass Lowell and North Carolina State chapters. However, in 1998 the UMass Dartmouth chapter was reactivated, only to be subsequently shuttered again. In 1980 Steve Call, a pledge of Delta Kappa Phi at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, died after falling ill as the result of an intense program of hazing-related calisthenics he had been required to perform. The character of the fraternity has significantly differed from school to school. In spite of its origin as a professional textile engineering fraternity, many of its chapters had evolved to become social fraternities with some characteristics of a professional fraternity. While the existing Lowell chapter is social in nature, the now-dormant chapters at North Carolina State and Georgia Tech had been primarily oriented as professional fraternities. Even while a social fraternity, Delta Kappa Phi's origin as a professional fraternity make it the oldest textile fraternity in America.According to the Fraternity's website, accessed 6 Oct 2020. Purpose The Fraternity's website explains: > The purpose of the fraternity is the promotion and encouragement of a > fraternal relationship among its members; the furtherance of social > enjoyment among its members; and the advancement of the interests of its > members in acquiring a thorough education in engineering, the sciences or > the liberal arts.

He also held the title of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi), from 1282-1286. Background The Mongols had interfered in the political affairs of Tibet since c. 1240, using the senior lamas of the Sakya monastery as middlemen. A Mongol administration was set up in 1268-69 and a census was taken. Central Tibet was divided into 13 trikor () or myriarchies. The temporal administrator of Mongolian Tibet was called dpon-chen (ponchen) and resided in Sakya since about 1264.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, pp. 43-6. The abbot-rulers of the Sakya see enjoyed a precedence position, based on their personal ties with the Mongol great khans. This was in particular the case with Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa (1235‚Äì80), who also held the position of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at the Yuan court. The succeeding Imperial Preceptors always belonged to the clergymen of Sakya although they did not always belong to the line of ruling abbots, the Khon family.Petech 1990, pp. 36-7. Neither the abbot-ruler or Dishi were, however, viceroys of Tibet as sometimes stated. Nevertheless, the Dishi issued orders in the name of the supreme imperial authority which gave some of them great influence.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan painted scrolls, Rome 1949, Vol. I, p. 15. Becoming the Imperial Preceptor Dharmapala Raksita was born in 1268 as the posthumous son of Chakna Dorje (, 1239-1267), a brother of the Sakya lord Phagpa. Chakna was thoroughly Mongolized, dressed in Mongol clothing and was eventually appointed viceroy of the three cholkas (regions) of Tibet.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 109. He married Megadung, a daughter of the Mongol prince Godan Khan and great-granddaughter of Genghis Khan. His son Dharmapala was born from another consort, Khadrobum of Zhalu.Petech 1990, pp. 19-20, 26. Being fatherless at birth, his uncle Phagpa entrusted his upbringing to the lord of Zhalu. When Phagpa died in December 1280, poisoned according to the rumours, Kublai Khan sent an army of Mongols and Amdo Tibetans into √ú-Tsang in order to control the tense situation. The former dpon-chen Kunga Zangpo, suspected of orchestrating Phagpa's death, was caught and executed. The troops were strategically deployed in the central parts of the country, and at the borders. This was the first permanent occupation of Tibet by Mongol troops.Petech 1990, p. 25. Dharmapala inherited his uncle's position as lord of Sakya and performed the funeral rites. In 1281 he was summoned to appear before Kublai Khan in Beijing and was formally appointed Dishi in 1282 at the age of 14, succeeding his other uncle, Rinchen Gyaltsen. He was nevertheless still a layman and never became an abbot. During the next years he stayed close to the great khan and engaged in building activity. Thus he had a stupa erected to the memory of Phagpa, furthermore building the monastery Metog Raba which remained the official residence for the Dishi until the end of the Yuan dynasty.Petech 1990, p. 26. Developments in Central Tibet The real authority in Central Tibet during these years rested with the dpon-chen. A Changchub Rinchen was appointed by Khubilai Khan in 1281, but soon fell ill and died or was murdered (1281/82). He was succeeded by Kunga Zhonnu (1282-c. 1285) and Zhonnu Wangchuk (c. 1285-1288). At this time Central Tibet was severely impoverished. Kunga Zhonnu ordered a tax remission and in 1287 a revision of the 1268 census was carried out to establish a sounder fiscal base.Petech 1990, pp. 27-8. As for Dharmapala he vacated his position as Dishi in 1286 and departed from the imperial court to revisit Tibet and Sakya. However, he died on his way at Tre Mandala (Chuwo) on 24 December 1287.Thus not in 1286 as stated in Giuseppe Tucci 1949, Vol. I, p. 15. He was married to Palden, a granddaughter of K√∂den, and also to a lady from Zhalu called Jowo Tagibum.Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 109. The last-mentioned bore him a son Ratnabhadra who died at the age of five. Thus this branch of the Khon family died out. Khubilai Khan appointed a Sakya abbot and a Dishi, neither of whom belonged to the Khon lineage. It was only in 1306 that Sakya was once again ruled by a relative of Dharmapala, Zangpo Pal.Petech 1990, pp. 26-9.

This is the principal source of electrical energy for Shetland, however currently about 20 MWe is provided by the Sullom Voe Terminal power station which comprises 4 x 23 MWe Gas Turbines, the future of which is uncertain. Opened on 27 May 1953 the station is diesel-fuelled and generates a total of 66 MW of power. Equipment Originally the facility had six 6 MWe Mirrlees diesel generator K Major sets (some of which have been decommissioned); two 8 MWe French Pielstick engines were added in 1983 and a further Finnish 12 MWe W√§rtsil√§ (originally a Stork Werkspoor design) engine was commissioned in 1994. A waste-heat recovery system applied to the exhaust of the Wartsila only produces super-heated steam which runs a 2.1 MW WH Allen turbine, thus making this set a combined cycle. Two standby gas turbine generator units, each with a capacity of 5 MW, were installed in containers outside the existing buildings to augment peak output. The plant is operated by Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE).\\"Lerwick Power Station\\". Gazetteer for Scotland. Retrieved 30 December 2014. Load balancing The growth of output from wind turbines in Shetland has increased instability in the local grid (which is not connected to the national grid on mainland Scotland). SSE installed a 1 MW sodium-sulphur battery in a nearby building to ameliorate the peak loads. however due to safety concerns, the sodium-sulfur battery was removed prior to commissioning and the energy storage building was reconfigured to accommodate 3MWh of advanced lead-acid batteries. Replacement plan There are proposals to replace the power station at a new greenfield site north of the existing one. Planning permission has been granted for the development however the decision to proceed has been delayed by the proposed Shetland HVDC Connection, which depending on how it is implemented may make such a station redundant, or only required as standby, which would affect the type of plant chosen. Lerwick District Heating There is an adjacent but district heating network see Lerwick District Heating and Energy Recovery Plant. However for a variety of reasons the rejected heat has never been used as a heat source for the network. This is unlikely to happen with the existing power station as it will be closed soon.

The non-violent coup was executed by the then-Army commander and royal Prince, Mohammed Daoud Khan who led forces in Kabul along with then- chief of staff General Abdul Karim Mustaghni to overthrow the monarchy while the King was abroad in Ischia, Italy. Daoud Khan was assisted by leftist Army officers and civil servants from the Parcham faction of the PDPA, including Air Force colonel Abdul Qadir. King Zahir Shah decided not to retaliate and he formally abdicated on August 24, remaining in Italy in exile. More than two centuries of royal rule (since the founding of the Durrani Empire in 1747) ended. Background Zahir Shah had ruled as King since 1933, and his cousin Prince Daoud Khan had served as Prime Minister from 1953 to 1963. Daoud Khan had strained relations with the King and he was also unable to hold political office after the 1964 constitution, which barred members of the Barakzai dynasty. Some believe the King did this on purpose because of Daoud Khan's strong pro-Pashtunistan views, which he deemed too radical and led to political rifts with Pakistan. Daoud Khan took the opportunity during growing discontent from the public over the failure of reforms by five successive governments since a parliamentary monarchy was formed in 1964, including the King's failure to promulgate the Political Parties Law, Provincial Councils Law, and Municipal Councils Act, all of which were passed by parliament. Another reason was the poor response to the famine in 1971‚Äì72 that is believed to have killed thousands in the central and north-western parts of the country, particularly Ghor Province -https://minorityrights.org/wp- content/uploads/old-site-downloads/download-416-Afghanistan-A-Nation-of- Minorities.pdf causing the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul Zahir's government. Circa 1972 people were unhappy with the parliament's ineffectiveness and lack of leadership, leading to growing various political movements at universities.https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB59/ Daoud Khan's internal disputes with the King has also been cited as a possible reason of his decision to launch a coup.https://www.rferl.org/a/1103837.html Some scholars and historians have suggested a possible involvement of the Soviet Union in the coup, although this is not particularly evident.https://www.rferl.org/a/1103837.html The coup King Zahir Shah and several of his accompanies including Sardar Shah Wali Khan left Afghanistan for London, via Rome, on the morning of June 25, 1973 reportedly for hemorrhaging treatment after injuring his eye. After treatment he went back to Italy spending time in the island of Ischia.https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB59/ Mohammed Daoud Khan along with several hundred of his supporters from the Army launched the coup in the morning of July 17;https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB59/ within hours and without any armed resistance, the monarchy ended and Khan announced the new republic through Radio Afghanistan at 7 in the morning. Staff from the United States National Security Council described it as a \\"well planned and swiftly executed coup.\\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB59/ The only casualties were 7 police officers at a station, who mistook the rebels for a hostile force; and a tank commander who drowned in the Kabul River after swerving off the road trying to avoid colliding with a bus. Aftermath Despite being part of the Musahiban Barakzai dynasty, Daoud Khan abolished the monarchy and created a new Republic instead, declaring himself as head of state and head of government, foreign minister and head of the Army. The royal Arg (palace) in Kabul became the official presidential residence. In a radio addressing, he called the coup a \\"national and progressive revolution\\", calling the King's rule ‚Äúcorrupt and effete‚Äù and vowed to replace it with ‚Äúgenuine democracy‚Äù. He pledged to continue Afghanistan's long-standing policy of neutrality. The Soviet Union and India diplomatically recognized the new government on July 19. The coup was apparently popular among the population, who viewed Daoud Khan as a forceful leader.http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/88.htm The positive domestic reception to the republic was also a reason why Zahir Shah decided to abdicate from the throne.http://afghandata.org:8080/jspui/bitstream/azu/6329/1/azu_acku_serial_ds350_a37_a34_v26_n2_w.pdf Daoud Khan's links to Marxism, and the Parchamite support in his military coup's, led to some suspecting it as being a communist takeover. In order to prevent opposition, he assured continuity of religious and cultural heritage, as demonstrated in the Republican Decrees created in July 1973. Upon coming to power, Daoud Khan disbanded the parliament and the judiciary, with direct executive rule established. Despite his socialist views, Khan did not bring drastic change to the economic system and maintained connections with the Cold War superpowers. A loya jirga was convened following the Constitutional Assembly election in January 1977, and approved a new constitution creating a presidential one-party state, with strong powers to the head of state. During his time as head of state, Khan's relations with the Soviet Union, Pakistan, and the communists, deteriorated for several reasons. Eventually he was overthrown and killed during the Saur Revolution in 1978, including by several high-ranking civilian and military people who helped him get to power in 1973.

It was conceived by designer Thomas Lomm√©e, and first demonstrated at the Z33, a house for contemporary art.About Z33, Z33.be According to Lommee, the OpenStructures project explores the possibility of a modular system where \\"everyone designs for everyone.\\" OpenStructures is developing a database where anyone can share designs which are in turn available for download by the public. Each component design in the OS system will feature previously designed OS parts that were used to create it. In addition, each part will feature component designs that can be made from it. The OpenStructures model includes large and small scale manufacturers as well as craftsmen. They are invited to create their own designs according to the OS standard for sale on the market, which can in turn be fixed or disassembled at their end of life and made into new products.  Grid  thumb The OpenStructures grid is built around a square of 4 x 4 cm and is scalable. The squares can be further subdivided or put together to form larger squares, without losing inter-compatibility. The image shows nine complete squares of each 4x4 cm put together. Designers use the OS grid to determine dimensions, assembly points, and interconnecting diameters. This allows parts that were not originally from the same design to be used together in a new design.  Scales OpenStructures works at several scales, and analogies are made to biological systems including (from smallest to biggest): * Parts, like body tissues. * Components, like organs, formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues. An example is a motor. * Structures, like a group of related organs in an organ system. Here, different components are composed with frames and joints, such as a bicycle. * Superstructures, like organisms, can be understood as the whole hierarchical assembly of different structures that together function as a stable whole which has the capacity to grow and develop. Example are houses or electric vehicles.  Open architecture One of the research areas of OpenStructures is architecture. Architects of the Brussels Cooperation CollectiveBrussels Cooperation Collective have worked on the subject.Short Description and Master Document Case Study n¬∞1, The project Case Study n¬∞1 is a master plan for a social centre and community in Katanga, Congo, developed in collaboration with ‚ÄòIntrastructures‚Äô, a Belgian design studio.

Its creation was mentioned in the yearly children's issue of The Crisis in October 1919. The first issue was published during the Harlem Renaissance in January 1920, with issues published monthly until December 1921. It is cited as an \\"important moment in literary history\\" for establishing black children's literature in the United States. Background The magazine was created by three people, all of whom were also involved with The Crisis, a magazine associated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Its editor was W. E. B. Du Bois, one of the founders of the NAACP, and its business manager was Augustus Granville Dill. The magazine's literary editor was Jessie Redmon Fauset. Each year, The Crisis published an issue referred to as the \\"Children's Number\\", which included stories, photographs, games, poetry, and educational achievements of black children. These issues also contained more serious information, particularly political events and lynchings in the United States; Du Bois covered lynchings and violent attacks on black Americans because he was concerned about the effects that reports of these incidents would have on black children. In the October 1919 \\"Children's Number\\" issue of The Crisis, Du Bois wrote a column titled \\"The True Brownies\\" announcing the impending publication of The Brownies' Book, stating that the first issue would be released the following month. He also stated that it was \\"designed for all children, but especially for ours\\", with a target audience of children and youth between six and 16 years old. Dill and Du Bois established Du Bois and Dill Publishers in New York City to publish each issue of The Brownies' Book. One of the goals of the magazine was to dispel the \\"grotesque stereotypes\\" of the \\"Dark Continent\\", a disparaging term used for Africa and its people. Middle-class African-American children \\"consumed this propaganda along with the white children who were its implied audience\\" in children's literary works such as the magazine St. Nicholas. The 1919 article \\"The True Brownies\\" included commentary by Du Bois discussing children, stating that \\"to seek to raise them in ignorance of their racial identity and peculiar situation is inadvisable‚Äîimpossible\\", in which the use of the phrase \\"peculiar situation\\" is an allusion to the euphemism \\"peculiar institution\\", meaning slavery. Du Bois believed children should be taught their racial identity and social situation. The name of the magazine is derived from the folkloric creatures brownies, who were said to complete household chores at night in exchange for food, alluding to African Americans being used as servants, but the term is used as signification in the \\"oppressive literary-historical context\\". Specifically, the creators wanted to \\"make colored children realize that being 'colored' is a normal beautiful thing\\". Another goal was to expand the canon of black children's literature, in which fiction and fantasy were rare, and to encourage youth participation in the NAACP. It also intended to develop The Talented Tenth, capable African Americans in the top decile who could become leaders in the black community. The seven goals stated in \\"The True Brownies\\" were: Content and editing Each issue was published on good quality paper, the cover of each designed by prominent black artists. Its format and layout was similar to that of The Crisis, and it contained little advertising. Illustrations and photographs complemented the varied content, which included poetry, literature, biographies of successful black people, music, games, plays, and current events. Biographies included those for Phillis Wheatley, the first published African-American woman, Bert Williams, a popular entertainer of the Vaudeville era, and Sojourner Truth, an abolitionist and women's rights activist that had been born into slavery. The advertising it did include promoted black children's literature not typically available in bookstores. Each issue cost 15 cents, with a yearly subscription costing . Common elements in each issue were the column \\"As the Crow Flies\\", written by Du Bois to relate current events to the children, an advice column by Fauset titled \\"The Judge\\", a reader's letters section named \\"The Jury\\", and \\"Little People of the Month\\" featuring photographs and the artistic and academic achievements of children submitted by its readers. Content generated by Du Bois would exhibit his \\"opposition to the social philosophy\\" of Booker T. Washington. His articles for \\"As the Crow Flies\\" were usually at \\"a level incredibly sophisticated for a children's magazine\\". The inaugural issue contained a photo of African-American children protesting violence against blacks by marching in the Silent Parade of 1917 in New York City. Fauset solicited submissions from many notable authors, particularly those in the Harlem Renaissance movement. Among notable authors to have material published in The Brownies' Book were Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, Winifred Davidson, Effie Lee Newsome and Georgia Douglas Johnson. Some of the authors had read St. Nicholas as children, including Du Bois' daughter Yolande and Newsome. Langston Hughes in 1936, photographed by Carl Van Vechten Hughes submitted a letter to the editor and his high school graduation photograph to the magazine, which published it in one of its summer issues with those of other high school graduates. In 1921, The Brownies' Book became the first publication to publish his poetry, and it would publish more of his works in subsequent issues. Fauset requested Hughes to write about life in Mexico because of its exotic appeal in the United States. Larsen's first literary works were two articles about games she claimed she learned and played during her youth in Denmark, published in The Brownies' Book with the byline attributing Nella Larsen Imes. Although Fauset was the literary editor, she was also likely responsible for most of the managing editorial work, a role by which she was officially recognized in the second year of the magazine's publication. She also dealt with all correspondence, and wrote hundreds of the articles that appeared in the magazine. Fauset promoted the work of African- American women authors and illustrators, for some of whom it launched their career. Legacy The periodical magazine has garnered more critical attention than any other black children's literature produced during the Harlem Renaissance. The Du Bois and Dill Publishers ceased operations after publication of The Brownies' Book was discontinued. Its only other publication was the 1921 book Unsung Heroes by Elizabeth Ross Haynes. In 2014, The Brownies' Book was resurrected with the permission of the estate. The magazine was made available for purchase in the fall of 2019 and distributed on its Centennial Anniversary in January 2020.

Perkins was United States champion in men's 35-lb weight throw in 1940 and held the weight throw indoor world record for nine years. He was also a good hammer thrower and football player. Biography Early life and athletic career Perkins was born in Augusta, Maine on July 1, 1919. He became an athlete at Cony High School in Augusta, setting a school record in the hammer and playing tackle on the football team. For one year he attended Governor Dummer Academy, where he threw the 12-pound high school hammer 201 feet in training (the national high school record was 196 feet) and was named 1938's top high school hammer thrower in the United States. After graduating from high school Perkins went to Bowdoin College; his track coach at Bowdoin was Jack Magee, whose previous pupils included 1924 Olympic hammer throw champion Fred Tootell. At the 1939 national (AAU) junior championships Perkins placed third in the hammer and second in the 56-pound weight throw; both were won by Stan Johnson, a fellow Maine thrower. Perkins also continued to play football; he was noted as a good field goal kicker, and in one game against Colby College he scored Bowdoin's only points in a 6-0 win with his two field goals. At the 1940 national indoor championships Perkins won the 35-lb weight throw, throwing 56 ft in (17.10 m) and defeating former champions Henry Dreyer and Irving Folwartshny. Two weeks later, on March 8, 1940, Perkins threw 58 ft in (17.86 m) and broke Dreyer's world record by three inches; Perkins held the world record for almost nine years, until Jim Scholtz broke it in the 1949 IC4A indoor championships. In training Perkins reportedly threw over 59 feet, and 61 feet on a fouled throw. After two years at Bowdoin Perkins switched to the University of Maine to study engineering, and his athletic career trailed off; although he attempted to defend his indoor weight throw title at the 1941 championships, he was no longer one of the favorites, and only placed fifth as Dreyer regained the title. Later life In 1941 Perkins got a job as a machinist for Bath Iron Works, staying with the company until 1944 and becoming its production and planning supervisor. During the last years of World War II he served in the United States Navy, but started suffering from serious health problems, including meningitis and poliomyelitis. After recovering and receiving his discharge from the Navy in 1945 Perkins embarked on a new career as a physician, returning to Bowdoin for a one-year pre-medical course and then enrolling at Tufts University School of Medicine. He served as assistant track and field coach at both schools while studying; at Tufts, he coached Tom Bane and Bob Backus, both of whom also set indoor world records in the weight throw. After completing his internship at the Maine General Hospital Perkins returned to Bath Iron Works, this time as an industrial physician; he also worked as a private practitioner. In 1955 he became full-time mill physician for the Oxford Paper Company. Later, he moved to Portland, where he specialized in cardiology and internal medicine; in 1965, he received the A. H. Robins Award for outstanding community service by a Maine physician. He was instrumental in the creation of the Penobscot Bay Medical Center, and became its first executive director. Perkins drowned in the Miramichi River in New Brunswick, Canada on April 25, 1971 while on a fishing trip. His canoe capsized, and in heavy clothes in the cold water he was unable to swim to safety; although he was presumed to have drowned, his fate was not known with certainty until his body was found washed up on the shore in Blackville, New Brunswick some time later. After Perkins's death, the Penobscot Bay Medical Center named its ambulatory care unit and library after him. Perkins was posthumously inducted in the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 1982.

Uses and adaptations  Contextual application design has primarily been used to create mobile applications that may deliver valuable insights based on cross referencing digital content with physical context, such as the experience delivered by Google Now.

These methods have also been implemented for software,Rockwell, C. 1999.

Morgan, T. Bratteteig, G. Ghosh, and D. Svanaes, Eds. NordiCHI '06, vol. 189. ACM Press, New York, NY, 437-440.  Process overview  The contextual design process consists of the following: contextual inquiry, data consolidation and analytics, visioning, storyboarding, user environment design, and prototyping.  Collecting data ‚Äì contextual inquiry  Contextual inquiry is a field data collection technique used to capture detailed information about how users of a product interact with the product in their normal environment. In mobile applications, a key aspect of the technique is detailed logging of their physical environment factors (factors), typically achieved by logging mobile sensor data or data from a contextual awareness SDK, combined with their in- app activity and interaction. Key takeaways from the technique are to learn what users actually do, why they do it that way and when.  Data analytics  The purpose of the data analysis is to reveal patterns and the structure across distinct interactions. A contextual data analytics collects data logs, events and context awareness parameters and streams them into an easy to process database which may be queried to provide insights. A typical example would be the system implemented by Sensiya Analytics.  Visioning  In visioning, a cross-functional team comes together to vision and suggest better performing experiences based on reviewing the data and identifying key issues and opportunities. Visions are a variety of new product concepts for different usage scenarios based on the data collected.  Storyboarding  After visioning, a design team develops the vision in storyboards, capturing scenarios of how users will work with the new system under different context.  Software prototyping  Software prototyping is used for testing the design ideas with interactive prototypes before the implementation phase helps the designers communicate with users about the new system and develop the design further.

She was the lead ship of the , which included three sister ships. Named for Mount Etna on the island of Sicily, the ship was laid down in January 1883, was launched in September 1885, and was completed in December 1887. She was armed with a main battery of two and six guns, and could steam at a speed of around . Etna frequently cruised abroad throughout her career, including visits to the United States for the World's Columbian Exposition and the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration in 1893 and 1909, respectively. She served as a training ship for naval cadets from 1907. She saw action during the Italo- Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912, primarily providing gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in Libya. By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Etna had been withdrawn from service and was employed as a headquarters ship for the commander of the Italian fleet at Taranto and later for the light forces based at Brindisi. The old cruiser was finally sold for scrap in May 1921. Description Etna was between perpendiculars, with a beam of . She had a mean draft of and displaced .

The main armament of the ships consisted of two Armstrong , 30-caliber breech-loading guns mounted in barbettes fore and aft. She was also equipped with six , 32-caliber, breech-loading guns that were carried in sponsons along the sides of the ship. For anti-torpedo boat defense, Etna was fitted with five 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and five 1-pounder Hotchkiss guns. Etna was also armed with four torpedo tubes. One was mounted in the bow underwater and the other three were above water.Brook, p. 97 She was protected with an armored deck below the waterline with a maximum thickness of . The conning tower had worth of armor plating. From 1905 to 1907 the ship was rebuilt with forecastle and poop decks added and her armament was revised. The heavy 10-inch guns were replaced with two quick-firing (QF) guns and the six breech-loading 6-inch guns were replaced by four QF 6-inch guns, two on each side amidships. Service history Etna was built by the Castellammare shipyard; her keel was laid down on 19 January 1883 and her completed hull was launched on 26 September 1885. After fitting-out work was finished, she was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 3 December 1887.Gardiner, p. 348 Etna served in the Squadra Permamente (Permanent Squadron) from her commissioning to 1893 and then served in North and South American waters until the end of 1895.

Eva Marie Rosenfeld (5 January 1892 ‚Äì 17 August 1977) was a Jewish-German-British psychoanalyst, an analysand of Sigmund Freud and Melanie Klein. Although born in New York City, Eva Rosenfeld spent her youth in Berlin where her father Theodor Rosenfeld was a theater producer, one of the members of the Freie B√ºhne theatre. When Eva was 15 years old, her father died and she left school to begin her career as a social worker. In 1911 she married her cousin, the lawyer Valentin Rosenfeld (1886‚Äì1970). Valentin studied in Vienna and attended the lectures held by Freud. Through her husband, Eva first became aware of psychoanalysis. When they married, they settled in Vienna. Eva and Valentin Rosenfeld had four children, but three of them died in young age. The loss of children ‚Äî especially the 15-year-old daughter Rosemarie in 1927 ‚Äî shadowed the later life of Eva Rosenfeld. After World War I Rosenfeld opened a school for girls. Eva Rosenfeld and Anna Freud became close friends sometime in 1924 through Siegfried Bernfeld. In 1927 Rosenfeld and Anna Freud founded (together with Dorothy Burlingham) a school in Vienna where most of the students underwent psychoanalysis, usually with Anna Freud. Eva Rosenfeld was a patient of Sigmund Freud from 1929 until 1931. After her divorce she returned to Berlin in 1931 and assisted Ernst Simmel at a psychoanalytical sanatorium. Her formal education as a psychoanalyst was completed in Berlin. In 1936 she moved to England, where she worked the rest of her life as a psychotherapist and supervising analyst; her analysands include Benjamin B. Rubinstein, Nina Coltart and Maria W. Piers. She was further analyzed by Melanie Klein in 1938‚Äì1941 and this damaged her relations with the Freud family. Writings * The Pan-headed Moses: A parallel.

He travelled several times to New France, where he explored the regions along the Mississippi. Life and work Bossu was born on 1720-9-29 into a family of surgeons, nevertheless he pursued a career in the military. For his performance during the siege of Chateau-Queyrashe was promoted to a lieutenant. Later he became a captain in the French navy, which enabled him to travel to the New World. In 1750 Bossu was a member of military reinforcements being send to New Orleans, the capital of the French colony Louisiana. Bossu's convoy left France on 1750-12-26 and traveled first to Cap-Fran√ßois in Saint- Domingue, where it arrived mid February. After a short stay the convoy left for New Orleans on 1751-3-8 finally arriving in early April. Soon after his arrival in New Orleans Bossu set out to explore the Mississippi River and neighbouring areas. First he traveled to the Natchez and later to the Quapaw, who made him a member of their tribe. Later he explored the lower parts of the Arkansas River and followed the Mississippi River into Illinois. in 1757 Bossu returned to France to report on the state of the French colony and was ordered back to New Orleans the same year. Louis Billouart the governor of Louisiana sent him from New Orleans to Fort Toulouse at the eastern border of the colony. In 1759 he was assigned to lead a convoy to Fort Tombecbe, where the Choctaw were living. He returned to New Orleans the same year and little is known what he did until early January in 1763 when he returned to France. Back in France he had to spend six weeks in prison for having criticized Louis Billouart for assigning the command of the convoy to Fort Toulouse to less experienced officer. In 1770 Bossu embarked on his third and last voyage to the New World. He visited places in Louisiana again, which however by then was not a French colony anymore. In particular he paid a visit to the Quapaw,who had bestowed a tribe membership on him years ago. Upon his return to France the same year, Bossu decided to settle in Burgundy. First he lived for a while in Auxerre and later for some time with a nephew in Aisey-sur-Seine, finally he died in 1792 in Montbard. During his first two travels in the New World Bossu wrote many letters with detailed accounts of his experiences. Back in France he published a compilation of those letters in 1768. He also wrote an account of his third voyage, which he published as well. Bossu was keen observer making the accounts of his travels an important source for historians and ethnologists on New Orleans, the French colony and the Indian tribes in Mississippi region during the 18th century.

The roadhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The roadhouse was originally built in 1907-1908 by John Sullivan and his wife along the banks of Delta Creek, on the path of a winter cutoff of the main trail between Valdez and Fairbanks. Used by the Valdez-Fairbanks Winter Stage Line, frozen stream crossings in the winter months allowed a savings of 35 miles from the main trail, which was used by prospectors and others traveling north to the gold fields. The roadhouse was originally located along Delta Creek near a gravel airstrip (). It was operated by the Sullivans until about 1922, when the Alaska Railway became the dominant means of transport in the region and the Alaska Road Commission (ARC) stopped maintaining the cut-off. The Sullivans died four months apart in 1924, the ARC officially abandoned the cut-off in 1925. The site and the unused buildings were annexed by Fort Greely during World War II, on what became the northwest boundary of the Oklahoma Bombing Range. The roadhouse was at one time a complex of five buildings, including an outhouse, smithy, and barn, but only the main portion of the principal structure survived into the 1990s. All of the buildings were of log construction, but only the main house was roofed with corrugated metal. The others had sod roofs, which gave way over time. The roadhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its role as a winter stop on the stage line and as one of the few remaining log roadhouses from its time. Preservation The roadhouse area was not easily accessible by the public due to its remote location, lack of a public road, and the possibility of un-exploded ordnance from the nearby bombing range. The Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Army, and local historians moved the building into Delta Junction in 1997. The original building was disassembled, and a combination of new and original logs were used to rebuild it in its new location next to the visitors center. The roof and windows were replaced. Now known as the Sullivan Roadhouse Historical Museum, it is owned and operated by Delta Junction Chamber of Commerce.

He captured a bronze medal in the 67-kg division at the 2002 Asian Taekwondo Championships in Amman, Jordan, and represented his nation Australia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Before his sporting career ended in late 2004, Massimino trained full-time for Hall's Taekwondo Academy in Brisbane, under head coach and master Martin Hall. Massimino made his official debut, as part of the home nation squad, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's featherweight class (68 kg). He handily defeated Spain's Francisco Zas by a marginal judging decision in his opening match, before bowing out in a 1‚Äì1 draw to U.S. taekwondo jin and eventual Olympic champion Steven L√≥pez. Spurred on by the noise of his Aussie fans, Massimino redeemed himself from a premature exit to edge past Italy's Claudio Nolano 9‚Äì7, but came to a dramatic halt with a narrow 5‚Äì6 defeat to Iran's Hadi Saei in the repechage round, relegating Massimino to fifth. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Massimino qualified for his second Aussie team in the men's featherweight class (68 kg), by placing second behind Iran's Hadi Saei and granting a berth from the Asian Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Bangkok, Thailand. Massimino opened his match with a more satisfying 7‚Äì2 victory over Tunisia's Mohamed Omrani in the prelims, before he was dangerously beaten by Guatemalan fighter and two-time Olympian Gabriel Sagastume in the quarterfinal match 4‚Äì5. With Sagastume losing the semifinal to Chinese Taipei's Huang Chih- hsiung, Massimino denied his opportunity to compete in the repechage rounds. Shortly after his second Olympics, Massimino firmly made his decision to retire from competitive taekwondo, and focus instead on fulfilling his dream of opening up a taekwondo centre in honor of his name, which progressively became one of Australia's fastest growing sport academies.

The building rests on a brick foundation, inside which a full concrete basement was later poured, and has a high-pitch hip roof. The building's main (north-facing) facade is three bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by large single-pane windows. The entrance is sheltered by a gable-roofed portico, supported by slender columns. It has diamond-pane sidelights and transom surrounding a panelled doorway. The interior of the building has retained all of its original woodwork and finish. It is organized in a typical early 20th-century plan, with a central librarian's desk with a reading room on one side and stacks on the other. A full basement was added in 1957. The library was established by a bequest from longtime local residents Eleanor Bryant Whitman and Alanson M. Whitman, both descendants of early settlers of the area. The bequest required the town to provide land for the library, but provided funds for the construction and filling of the library's shelves.

It has worked in support of Palestinians in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon since its foundation. From 1999 to 2011 the organisation also worked in the Balkans, and it has worked in Syria since 2012. The group has been profiled by the medical doctors Mads Gilbert and Erik Fosse (president of NORWAC) during the conflicts in Gaza.\\"Gazalegene skriver bok\\", Dagen, 23.01.2009 Controversies In 1989 the organisation came under scrutiny from the research team of Marianne Heiberg from NUPI as part of a broad investigation of aid organisations funded by public allocations. The organisation was criticised for minimal-to-none developmental effects, lack of understanding of local needs, lack of control mechanisms and unprofessional management. NORWAC was also criticised for supporting fringe factions in Palestinian politics, and concluded that it did not meet the most elementary requirements for an aid organisation, in particular due to its \\"sectarian\\" work and taking political concerns. The report recommended to NORAD to stop all public allocations to the organisation. NORWAC was also scrutinised during a subsequent investigation of funds allocated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the conflicts in Gaza in 2009 and 2014, Gilbert and Fosse were accused in Norway and abroad of facilitating propaganda by Hamas. Their work at the Al-Shifa Hospital has been particularly noted amid allegations of the hospital's use as a Hamas headquarter. In 2014 Gilbert was banned indefinitely from entering Gaza through Israel, officially for \\"security reasons\\", but according to intelligence sources because there had been revealed \\"close ties\\" between Gilbert and Hamas-leaders. In 2014 it was reported that a hospital run by NORWAC in Syria in the town Tell Abyad treated wounded soldiers from terrorist organisation ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). Since 2013, when the hospital started being funded through NORWAC by Norwegian public aid, it was reported that ISIL had taken full control of the hospital and the surrounding area. According to both Arab and Kurdish sources, the hospital had become reserved entirely for ISIL soldiers and supporters. Erik Fosse rejected the latter reports, while admitting that the hospital treated ISIL jihadists. After subsequent investigations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that ISIL had enforced religious rules at the hospital, including rituals for prayer, gender segregation and regulations on clothing, Foreign Minister B√∏rge Brende cancelled all financial support directed to the hospital. While conforming to the decision, Fosse and NORWAC continued to deny that there were any enforcements by ISIL at the hospital.\\"UD stanser st√∏tte til ¬´norsk¬ª sykehus i Syria\\", VG, 11.12.2014 References Category:1983 establishments in Norway Category:Organizations established in 1983 Category:Medical and health organizations based in the State of Palestine Category:Foundations based in Norway Category:Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict ","title":"NORWAC"},{"id":"44880450","text":"The 1998 Legg Mason Tennis Classic was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts in Washington, D.C., United States, that was part of the International Series Gold of the 1998 ATP Tour.

Sir James was the only surviving son of Patrick Galloway, a prominent minister from Perth, and his first wife Martillo Guthrie. He served as Master of Requests to James VI and Charles I, and was made a Privy Councillor in 1630. He was ennobled by King Charles on the 15th of May 1645, for his faithful service during the civil war. He married an unknown daughter of a knight named Sir Robert Norter, and by her had one son Thomas, the second Lord Dunkeld. Thomas married Margaret Thomson, daughter of Sir Thomas Thomson of Duddingston, and by her had six sons and eight daughters, some of which died young: James, William, Thomas, John, Andrew, Margaret, Catherine, Jean, Anne, Elizabeth, Mary, Margaret, and Grisell. The eldest son James became the third Lord Dunkeld. He succeeded his father to the title c. 1684, though his father will still alive at that point and ultimately would post-decease him. Upon the Jacobite Uprisings against the rule of William of Orange, James took the side of the Jacobites, and had a commanding role in the Battle of Killiecrankie. For this his title was forfeited, and he was condemned to death for treachery. He fled to France, where he took up residence at the Jacobite court in St Germain. He was later killed while fighting for the French in the Battle of Cassano. James married Eleanor Sale, and by her had a son James and a daughter Mary. Mary became a nun at the convent of Val-de-Gr√¢ce in Paris, while James, who would have been the fourth Lord Dunkeld had the title not been forfeit, joined the military. He eventually reached the rank of brigadier of infantry in the Garde du Corps, and was created a chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis. He was later created a mar√©chal de camp, equivalent to a British major-general. James married twice, firstly Marie Margareut Angelique De Rat, and secondly an unknown widow of a Monsieur D'Ancelin. None of his children reached adulthood, and subsequently the line died. Arms The ancestral arms of the first Lord Dunkeld were argent, a lion rampant azure armed and langued gules. In 1630 he was granted the addition of a crest and motto by Sir James Balfour of Kinnaid, then Lord Lyon King of Arms. The original grant describes the crest as . Upon his ennoblement he became entitled to add supporters to his arms, and subsequently adopted two eagles sable.

With its grand opening in 2011, Ridge Hill features a variety of retail stores, restaurants, condominiums, and offices. It was developed by Forest City Ratner Companies, Forest City's New York subsidiary. The center was built on an 84-acre parcel of land purchased from the City of Yonkers. Forest City later sold its mall business to Queensland Investment Corporation. The mall's anchor stores are Showcase Cinemas, Dick's Sporting Goods, REI, TJ Maxx, and Legoland Discovery Centre. History L.L.Bean Plans were originally started in 2000 by the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency, which sought to develop a site to stimulate job growth. Prior to any development, the land was occupied by a sanitarium, hospital, church, and rehab center. After later granting a lease to Lockheed Martin, and when the lack of jobs continued, the lease was terminated by purchasing the remainder of the contract. The City of Yonkers began taking bids from developers, and Ridge Hill won the contract. The original tenants announced included Whole Foods Market and L.L.Bean. Saks Fifth Avenue also showed an interest in adding a location in Yonkers. In early 2007, the land was cleared to make way for Ridge Hill's construction. Construction formally broke ground on November 8, 2007, with an original projected completion date in 2009. However, in late 2009, Forest City stated that due to the economic recession, the anticipated completion would be pushed back until 2011. On November 18, 2010, it was announced that six additional companies would be joining the list of tenants: Dick's Sporting Goods, Brio Tuscan Grille, and REI. Later, on December 3, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would anchor Westchester's Ridge Hill with an location. It was the first Lord & Taylor to be built since 2001. That same year, Saks Fifth Avenue stated that they would not add a location at Ridge Hill. On March 26, 2013, a new $12 million, Legoland Discovery Center was opened. It was the first Legoland in the Northeast and fifth in the country. On November 19, 2014, it was announced that eight stores would be arriving at Ridge Hill including Starbucks and The Container Store. On August 2, 2020, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would be closing as part of a plan to close all 38 stores nationwide. Anchors The fountains near the cinema.

It is one of the few ecosystems that is conserved in Medell√≠n and is considered one of the city's seven \\"guardian\\" hills. The hill has a sculpture park, the open-air Carlos Vieco Auditorium, and the Pueblito Paisa a reproduction of the traditional Colombian township, amongst other sights. The hill is 80 meters tall and has an area of 333,300 m2. It is named after the indigenous Chief Nutibara. Initially with the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, the hill was called \\"Marcela of the Parra Hill\\", and then \\"Cadavides Hill\\". Finally, it was renamed Nutibara, which continues today. History Fireworks in Medell√≠n, as part of Colombian Bicentennial. Nutibara Hill can be seen on the left. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Medell√≠n was known as the Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria on the banks of the Santa Elena, Nutibara hill was not a part of the landscape of this small town. At that time it was identified as the \\"Marcela Hill of the Vine\\", name of the owner of these \\"remote\\" lands on the other side of Medell√≠n River. With this name it was identified until a family named Cadavid, became its new owner, acquiring the name \\"Hills of the Cadavides\\". So it was known even for two years after the Municipality of Medell√≠n bought it in 1927 for the cost of $50,000 pesos. It was bought in order to create a recreational park, preserving its ecological characteristics, for a city that continued to grow. In 1929 the Society of Public Improvements (, SMP), proposed to the City Council to rename the hill, making it less private and more public but at the time identified with the region. While the first initiative to find the new name was to open a contest, finally the members of the Board of the SMP chose the new name. With the choice of the name \\"Nutibara\\", SMP wanted to pay homage to one of the richest and most powerful of the caciques of the department of Antioquia, whose dominions extended over most of the West. After the name change in 1930, the Municipality authorized the Society of Public Improvements to work on the preparation of drawings and plans for the construction of a recreational park on the hill. A plan was approved in 1939, which included the design and construction of internal and external roads for easy access, gazebos, kiosks, planting trees, parking, lakes, waterfalls, rustic bridges, footpaths, approved viewpoints and a restaurant at the top. Attractions Pueblito Paisa Pueblito Paisa At its summit is the Pueblito Paisa, a reproduction of the municipalities of the Paisa region built in 1977. Sculpture Park The sculpture park created in 1983 at the initiative of former Colombian President Belisario Betancur Cuartas. The Medell√≠n Museum of Modern Art coordinated the installation of a permanent exhibition of sculptures made by 10 national and international artists installed in the natural environment of the hill. The first monumental sculpture that was made especially to decorate Nutibara was the Madremonte, by Jos√© Horacio Betancur in 1953. Since its delivery, Madremonte was exposed early in the House of Culture, and then the Nutibara hill, until March 27, 1986, when it was moved to the Botanical Garden of Medell√≠n in exchange for sculpture Cacique Nutibara, also by Betancur. Carlos Vieco Theater Carlos Vieco Theater The open air Carlos Vieco Theater is located on the northern slope of Nutibara Hill. It opened in 1984 and was designed by architect Oscar Mesa. The theater has a capacity of 3,800 spectators. It is named in honor of the Colombian composer Carlos Vieco Ortiz, who was born in Medell√≠n. It offers all kinds of popular shows. Every year in June, the theater becomes the epicenter of the concerts of the International Poetry Festival. There are also frequent rock concerts, like the Altavoz Festival.

Other examples of churches erected by the Secular priests in the Philippines during the above-mentioned era are the Manila Cathedral, Quiapo Church and the San Juan de Dios Church. Architecture The church is predominantly Baroque in style. Its first level is devoid of any embellishment or fenestration save for the main semicircular arched portal and the wave-like cornices and rounded, high- relief pilasters. A similar motif has been adapted on the second level of the fa√ßade, which is pierced by three windows. The center of the softly undulating pediment showcases one blind window encased by pilasters. The curved pediment ends smoothly into two large volutes which seat beside two, large, urn-like finials. The pediment is surmounted by a huge, knob-like finial.

The club was founded in 1959 and is exclusively concerned with the game of hurling. Naomh Moninne has the distinction of being the first club to represent Louth in the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship and is recognised for founding the All-Ireland Poc Fada Championship, a national annual GAA event. Naomh Moninne compete in the Louth Senior Hurling Championship and are the most successful hurling club in Louth, having won a record 22 championship titles. The club last won the championship in 2019 when they beat St. Fechin's in the final by 0‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì14. History Beginnings (1959‚Äì1960) Naomh Moninne Hurling Club started as a youth club, ‚ÄòCumann √ìgra Naomh Moninne‚Äô, in the Castletown area of Faughart in 1959. It was there that local priest, Father P√≥l Mac She√°in but more commonly referred to in Irish as ‚Äòan tAthair P√≥l Mac She√°in‚Äô, set up the first underage hurling team. Most of the young hurlers were from the Fatima estate in Castletown. Fr Mac She√°in was originally from County Armagh and was not just a hurling enthusiast, but also an advocate of the Irish language and culture. He named the club after St Moninne, a local saint who founded a convent in Faughart during the 5th century. The clubs first set of jerseys were obtained from a local club called Mount Rovers and had black and amber stripes. Naomh Moninne adopted these as their official colours and still use them to this day. The club first played on a small strip of land at Toberona corner known as ‚ÄòHoey's Plot‚Äô. As the game grew in popularity, the necessity arose for a larger playing field. Fr Mac She√°in was successful in obtaining permission from the then town clerk to use a piece of land at the back of Fatima known as ‚ÄòThe Meadows‚Äô, commonly referred to in Irish as ‚ÄòThe Bainseach‚Äô. Two railway carriages were obtained for use as changing rooms while the ESB provided lighting for training. Local residents who were instrumental in this development included Tom Casey, Frank Myles, Peter Callan, Sam McGuinness, Sean Murphy, Micheal Coburn, Tom Kinch and Dermot Keelan. In 1960, the local underage Gaelic football association, ‚ÄòCumann Peile na n√ìg‚Äô, were approached with the view to organising an underage hurling league in the town of Dundalk. Following on from discussions with Hugh O'Hare and Jim Whitty, the league was established. Naomh Moninne competed firstly at under-16 level, where they were to be successful, beating Castletown in the final after a replay, a victory that was met with great celebrations in the community. From these beginnings, there would soon be leagues running from under-8's to under-60's. Start of the Poc Fada (1960‚Äì1963) On 8 August 1960, Fr Mac She√°in staged a hurling event for the young hurlers of Fatima in the Cooley Mountains. Inspired by the stories of C√∫ Chulainn travelling over these mountains pucking his sliothar before him, six under-16 hurlers pucked from Anaverna to Aghameen, a distance of nearly , with the aim of completing the course in the fewest pucks. The final result was Damian Callan, 115; Jerome McDonagh, 117; Peter Myles, 125; Peter Crilly, 127; Se√°n McAneaney, 134; Mal Begley, 153; many of whom would later play senior hurling for Louth. Fr Mac She√°in named the competition thereafter ‚ÄòAn Poc Fada‚Äô, which is the Irish translation for ‚ÄòThe Long Puck‚Äô. The winner that day was Damien Callen with 115 pucks; he is recognised as being the first person to ever win the Poc Fada. In 1961, Fr Mac She√°in and the Naomh Moninne club founded the All- Ireland Poc Fada Championship. Sixteen hurlers from all over Ireland were invited to take part in the tournament. The winner of the first Poc Fada was a teacher from County Limerick named Vincent ‚ÄòGodfrey‚Äô Huggins. The following year, legendary Kilkenny goalkeeper Ollie Walsh won the tournament and went on to be joint winner in 1963. Apart from the competition being suspended between 1970 and 1980, it has been held every year since and has become a popular annual event on the national GAA calendar. It has attracted some of Ireland's greatest ever hurlers, in particular goalkeepers, whose long puckouts are well suited to the competition. Past winners include the likes of Ger Cunningham, Tommy Quaid, Davy Fitzgerald and Brendan Cummins. Early success (1964‚Äì1981) Success wasn't long coming to the newly formed club. They won their first Louth Hurling Championship in 1964, just five years after the club was set up. At that time, the Louth Hurling Championship had junior status, but was the highest level of championship hurling in Louth, making Naomh Moninne the top hurling club in the county. They successfully defended their title in 1965, making it two-in-a-row, a remarkable achievement for such a young club. They would not win another title until they achieved another two titles between 1973 and 1974. Winning the championship in 1974 qualified Naomh Moninne to compete in the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship, making them the first hurling club to represent Louth in a provincial club tournament. In their first match, they were drawn against the winners of the Meath Senior Hurling Championship, Boardsmill. Naomh Moninne went on to win two more county titles during the seventies, in 1976 and 1978. Less than 20 years after the club was founded, Naomh Moninne had already won six county titles, establishing themselves as one of the top hurling clubs in Louth. Although the club did not win another title for the next three years, this early success would be the foundation for the clubs dominance in Louth hurling in later years. Championship dominance (1982‚Äì1999) Naomh Moninnes' next six county titles were won consecutively between 1982 and 1987. This feat was unprecedented at the time and no other club in Louth has since achieved the six-in-a-row. The Louth Hurling Championship was also given senior status in 1987, making Naomh Moninne the first club to win a Louth Senior Hurling Championship. While they lost in the 1988 final to Wolf Tones, Naomh Moninne recaptured the title in 1989 to make it seven titles in eight years. That same year, the club achieved its first national title at underage level by winning the F√©ile na nGael Division 3. In 1990, the club suffered another defeat in the county final to Wolf Tones but their underage hurlers were successful once more winning the F√©ile na nGael Division 4. Their next success at senior level was when they won the double between 1992 and 1993. The club also achieved their first national title at adult level in 1993 when they won the All- Ireland Sevens Hurling Shield at the Kilmacud Crokes club in Dublin. Championship success came again in 1995 and then in abundance, when they won the treble between 1997 and 1999. This success was topped off by another All- Ireland Sevens Hurling Shield win in 1999. Naomh Moninnes' dominance of the Louth Hurling Championship during the 80's and 90's had made them the most successful club in the history of Louth hurling. Transition phase (2000‚Äì2017) For the first time since the club was founded, Naomh Moninne experienced a barren spell in the championship, failing to reach a county final over the next four years. The club was going through a transition phase after players from Knockbridge had broken away in 1998 to form their own team. Despite this setback, Naomh Moninne rediscovered their championship form in 2004 when they went all the way to the county final only to be beaten 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì6 by Pearse √ìg at P√°irc Mhuire in Ardee. The club did not reach another final over the next five years but remained positive, focusing their energy at underage level with the intention of rebuilding their once dominant senior team. In 2009, Naomh Moninne celebrated their 50th anniversary. Jubilee celebrations took place at Fairways Hotel in Dundalk on Friday, 11 September 2009 and included guest speakers, Christy Cooney and Brian Cody. The club, which had been homeless throughout these 50 years, announced that they had agreed a lease with Dundalk town council to develop land in Toberona into a playing pitch. To help finance this development, sporting memorabilia were auctioned on the night. In 2010, Naomh Moninne made it to the county final, ending a five-year run of finals between Knockbridge and Pearse √ìg, all of which Knockbridge had won. On 26 September, Naomh Moninne played Knockbridge in the final at Castlebellingham. Knockbridge were now competing for their sixth title in-a-row, a record that Moninne had set back in 1987. However, Moninne kept their record intact, beating their opponents in a thrilling comeback by 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì11. This was their first county title in 11 years, the longest period the club had gone without winning a title since it was first founded over 50 years previously. However, success did not last long as Moninne experienced another dry spell and did not reach the final again for another 7 years. On this occasion, they beat reigning champions St. Fechin's in the decider at Castlebellingham by 0‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì14.

She is reported to have been selected as one of the 1000 women shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005. She was honored by the Government of India, in 2000, with the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri. Biography > I feel that my biggest achievement has been in spreading awareness among > women in helping them root out drug abuse and alcoholism. It took time to > reach the grassroot level. As we have many tribes in Nagaland, the tribal > women‚Äôs organisations are our backbone, says Angami. Neidonuo Angami was born on 1 October 1950 in Kohima, the capital of the Northeast Indian state of Nagaland. She lost her father, who was a government official killed by the Naga insurgents, at the age of six and was brought up by her mother. Due to financial difficulty, Angami started her schooling late, at the age of eight, at the Mezh√ºr Higher Secondary School, erstwhile Cambridge School, and later continued at two other schools in Kohima, Baptist English School and the Government High School and passed the matriculation in 1968. Her college education was at the Kohima College from where she passed the Pre University Course and started her career as a Sub Inspector in the Kohima Police Force. However, she did not stay at the job for long. In 1972, she started working as a teacher and became active in social work by founding the Nagaland Weavers‚Äô Association. In 1984, Angami, along with a few other Naga women, formed the Naga Mothers' Association (NMA) to work against the social problems of drug addiction and alcoholism. The organization was planned as a platform for the women of various naga tribes for social activism and Angami was elected as its first general secretary. She has also served as its president for two terms. Angami is reported to have contributed to the formation of several satellite organizations of NMA such as NMA Youth and Women Welfare Organization in 1986, Mt Gilead Home in 1989, a shelter home and rehabilitation center for drug addicts and alcoholics, and the NMA HIV/AIDS Care Hospice in 2001, a subsidiary project for the shelter home for recycling paper. She is also known to have launched a social movement, Shed No More Blood, a campaign which provided the insurgents an opportunity to interact with the mainstream politics. Seeking assistance of other social and tribal organizations such as Naga HoHo, Naga Students Federation, and Naga People‚Äôs Movement for Human Rights, NMA was successful in brokering a ceasefire between the insurgents and the government. The organization also assisted in giving a proper burial for the casualties of the fight. She has also represented NMA in many peace talks held at Thailand, New Delhi and Nagaland. Honouring its efforts, the organization was awarded the Times of India Social Impact Award in 2013.

The play derives its name from the famous phrase of the Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, when he announced to the Tunisian people in 2011 that he finally understood them (Al‚Äôan Fahimtkum), before he was deposed in January 2011. The play was written by the Jordanian satirist and columnist, Ahmad Hasan Al-Zu'bi in 2011. The prominent Jordanian actor, Musa Hijazeen, played the main character in the play, Abu Saqer. He is the head of a Jordanian family of modern means and works as a driver for the government. Plot Abu Saqer is a controlling father whose children, in the wake of Arab spring, decide to unite ranks and demand that he give them more freedoms. When their mother joined them, Abu Saqer decided to give concessions, including financial allowances. In the play, Abu Saqer‚Äôs brother returns to Jordan after living for 30 years in Canada. Not aware of the Jordanian domestic affairs, he asks his brother, Abu Saqer, to explain to him the situation. Abu Saqer explains how things work in Jordan by satirically alluding to array of controversial issues of interest to all Jordanians, mainly the frequent ministerial re-shuffles (Jordan is famous for the frequent cabinet change), political parties and national unity.Reuters, Jordan: A Theater in Amman Puts on a Satirical Play about the Arab Spring and Protests, 1/5/2012, retrieved from: /RTV/2012/01/05/RTV33112/ Political Significance The play addresses several local political issues, mainly privatization and corruption. One of the powerful messages that resonated among Jordanians after the play was the phrase: ‚ÄúThey sold it‚Äù, this phrase was repeated throughout the play in reference to the wide-scale privatization of the Jordanian public institutions. After Jordanians watched the play on Roya TV, they constantly repeat it whenever the topic of privatization is being discussed.Abed, Tawfiq, Allan Fahmtikum Exposes Corruption in Jordan, Al-Jazeera, 12/18/2011, retrieved from: http://www.aljazeera.net/news/cultureandart/2011/12/18/-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D9%86- Al Zu'bi gives a voice to critics of the government who last year took to the streets demanding an end to political corruption and calling for deep reforms.

The film premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 12, 2017. It was released in China on July 21, 2018. Initially set to be released in the United States on multiple release dates through various distributors, who faced financial difficulties. It was officially released on Netflix on July 24, 2020 and received mixed reviews from critics. Plot In 1962, brothers Bob and Horatio Huntington run a traveling circus together, doing well in spite of their vastly different personalities. After a show, the circus' resident gypsy fortuneteller, Esmerelda presents her beautiful niece, Talia, to her employers, asking them to give her a job. Bob and Horatio are both immediately smitten with the lovely girl, but her affections are solely for Bob. When the pair announce their plans to marry, Horatio becomes furious, and delivers an ultimatum to his younger brother to choose either Talia or himself. Bob marries Talia, and Esmerelda gives them a mysterious box as a wedding gift, which allows them open a new circus; Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus, known for animals performing amazing, seemingly impossible, feats. Years later, Bob's nephew Owen marries a girl named Zoe at the circus. Upon initial excitement however, Owen soon discovers he now has to work as a taste tester for Zoe's father Mr. Woodley at his dog biscuit factory. Meanwhile, Horatio, whose luck has taken a serious downturn since his break with Bob, sneaks into Bob and Talia's trailer, trying to find the secret to the magic animals, and accidentally starts a fire which apparently kills Bob and Talia. Their funeral is attended by Owen, Zoe, and their daughter Mackenzie. Horatio makes an unexpected visit, and announces that he'll be taking over the circus. He and his henchmen start a fight, causing the Huntingtons to flee. Before they leave, circus pets Old Blue the bloodhound and Zena the cat give the Huntingtons the mysterious box, they later discover it holds animal cracker cookies. Owen eats one and turns into a hamster. The Huntingtons return to the circus to figure out how this happened. They learn from clown Chesterfield that the animal crackers will turn the user into the animal they eat, but it contains only one human cookie to change them back. Later, he tells them they inherited the circus. Zoe is excited, but Owen, determined to please Mr. Woodley, decides to continue his job. Zoe restores the circus while Owen stays at the dog biscuit factory. Mr. Woodley, frustrated that Zoe quit her job, begins to consider Brock, an egotistical saboteur, as her replacement. Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus reopens, but is a disaster, upon the discovery of no animals. Owen reluctantly decides to eat the animal crackers and performs stunts as an animal. By the end of the day, Owen grows to like it, and decides to quit his job. As his finishes packing up though, Brock unwittingly eats one of the cookies and turns into a mandrill. To catch up with him, Owen turns into a lion, but Brock gets captured by Horatio's henchman Mario Zucchini who also steals cookie crumbs. Owen soon discovers he lost the human cookie, and will remain an animal forever. He attempts to adapt to life as a certain animal, but has little success. Binkley, an employee of Mr. Woodley who's trying to create a new type of dog biscuit, discovers the animal crackers and persuades Mr. Woodley to attend the circus. At one performance, Horatio offers Owen his human cookie for the circus. Owen however, refuses, thinking remaining an animal will at least keep his family together, but he is forced into the deal by Horatio's henchmen, who are now mutated animals consumed from the cookie crumbs. The circus performers fight the henchmen. Horatio eats some crumbs and turns into a chimera. He is confronted by Old Blue and Zena who reveal themselves as Bob and Talia, alive but forever trapped in animal form due to the destruction of their human cookies in the fire. They ask Horatio to redeem himself, but he refuses. Horatio flies up, grasping them. Owen, Zoe, and Mackenzie, and the other circus performers work together to save Bob and Talia. Upon capturing Horatio, Owen turns Horatio into a hamster as punishment. Mr. Woodley reevaluates his views on the circus, and with Binkley, decides to create a new circus souvenir using her failed experiments. Owen and Zoe now work happily at the circus, with Owen debuting as a dragon.

Production Development and writing In 2010, Scott Christian Sava wrote a screenplay for Animal Crackers but was unable to garner any interest. In June 2013, Harvey Weinstein had seen a short film of the screenplay made by Sava and two months later the Weinstein brothers made an offer to buy the rights to Animal Crackers. Sava co-directed the movie with Tony Bancroft and co-wrote the screenplay with Dean Lorey. Financing the movie were executive producers Mu Yedong on behalf of Wen Hua Dongrun Investment Co., La Peikang, board chairman of China Film Co., and Sam Chi for Landmark Asia. Despicable Me character designer, Carter Goodrich, was hired in October 2014. Pre-production The voice cast was completed by casting director Jamie Thomason. In the last week of October and throughout November, 2014, Sava via the Animal Crackers Facebook page, there were sneak peeks to the look of some characters along with announcing the voice cast for those characters Kevin Grevioux as Samson the Strong Man, James Arnold Taylor as Buffalo Bob, Tara Strong as Talia, Harvey Fierstein as Esmerelda the Fortune Teller, Gilbert Gottfried as Mario Zucchini, and Raven-Symon√© as Binkley. On November 6, 2014, Blue Dream Studios announced Sylvester Stallone, Danny DeVito, and Ian McKellen as lead voice cast. On February 3, 2015, John Krasinski and Kaley Cuoco joined the cast as Owen and Zoe Huntington, respectively. On March 30, 2015, Emily Blunt replaced Cuoco due to a scheduling conflict. \\"When I was writing Animal Crackers I had specific voices in my head. Certain characters I wrote with actors in mind. Horatio was always Sir Ian McKellen. Brock was totally Patrick Warburton. Bullet-Man could be no one else but Stallone! To find out that each and every one of these actors have agreed to come on board this film and bring these characters to life‚Ä¶ I'm flipping out,\\" said Sava. It was announced via Sava's Facebook page that his son, Brendan, would play 12-year-old Owen Huntington and his wife, Donna, would play the Fat Lady. On May 22, 2015, it was revealed that Wallace Shawn had been cast as Mr. Woodley, Zoe's (Blunt) father. Filming On January 27, 2015, Sava announced on Facebook via the Animal Crackers page that first day of \\"studio sessions with the actors\\" began in Los Angeles. Music The film's original score was composed by Bear McCreary, and its soundtrack includes original songs by Toad the Wet Sprocket, Huey Lewis and the News, Howard Jones, and Michael Bubl√©. Soundtrack Score All tracks written and composed by Bear McCreary. Release Theatrical The film had its world premiere in competition at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 12, 2017.

It was powered by a pair of tandem-coupled V-8 engines but this power plant proved to be too troublesome for development to proceed. Design and development The P√©gase was a low wing cantilever monoplane, notable for its unusual engine and for its fuselage construction. Externally it appeared to be a conventional single engine aircraft with a three blade propeller but its Mathis G16 engine was the result of combining two Mathis G8 V-8s onto a single crankcase. The two units were connected to the propeller shaft with a free-wheel coupling in the reduction gearing so that if one failed, the other could continue to run. Thus the P√©gase had only single engine drag with the extra safety provided by two engines but none of the usual asymmetry issues associated with engine failure in a twin. Contemporary reporters were impressed with the \\"unit cabin\\". In the cabin region, fuselage stresses were carried by a keel, allowing the cabin sides and roof to be light and unstressed whilst maintaining the fuselage contours and to be generously glazed. The P√©gase had a slightly humped roofline, a conventional tail with a tall, straight tapered, round tipped fin and rudder and had a tricycle undercarriage. The P√©gase was on display at the Paris Salon of November 1946, but it did not fly until 27 February 1948. Tests revealed problems with the new, underdeveloped engine and only fifteen flights were made before the P√©gase programme was effectively abandoned, though from the April 1949 Salon Flight reported rather that development had been held up due to a shortage of engines.

His two principal claims to fame is as one of the chosen sculptors of the figures depicting characters from the novels of Sir Walter Scott on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh and for the figures on the north entrance porch of Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Life He was born in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, to James Shirreffs and his wife, Mary Wagrel, in 1846 and was baptised in the same parish on 14 April 1846. He studied at Glasgow School of Art under William Mossman from 1870 to 1873 winning a free scholarship in 1872. In 1877 he opened his own studio at 108 West Regent Street and in 1887 opened his own foundry at 261 West George Street, probably with his brother, Charles Gordon Shirreffs (1857-1913), who was a brass-founder. His bronze and copper-work are considerably more refined than his stone carving. He worked closely with the architect J J Burnet on several projects. He also did co-operative works with other sculptors such as Sir George Frampton, John Rhind and Pittendreigh MacGillivray. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1896.

It is situated in western part of Istria 6 km north-east from Poreƒç, Croatia.  Sightseeing  The sightseeing lasts 40 minutes, visitors descend along a 300m long pathway up to 60m below the ground and an underground lake and visit 5 beautifully decorated chambers. An interesting detail of this adventurous trip is also the encounter with the underground world of animals: visitors will see the cave olm (Proteus anguinus Laurenti), endemic in this dinaric karst region- an animal that can be found only in this karst area. In one of the chambers you will pass along a 4m wide passage that leads 66m vertically down reaching the deepest point of the cave at 132m. The cave is well-lit and ordered, the pathway and the stairs have firm rails. The temperature is very pleasant 14¬∞C. Guided tours start every 30 minutes with a guide (included in price) in the following languages: Croatian, Italian, German, English, Russian (with prior announcement Slovenian and French are available).  Terrain description  The Baredine cave got its name from the expression for the nearby terrain (baredine), which probably comes from the word bared, used in the local dialect to denote untreated land. The Baredine Cave is situated in the western part of Istria between Vi≈°njan and Poreƒç, only 5km away from the coast. The karst region, where it was created, is a sea sediment covered by red soil (terra rossa). From the vertical entrance into the cave situated at 117m above the sea level there views over olive and grape vine plantations all the way to the sea.  History   First explorations  The cave has been known and visited since times immemorial. The first documented explorations were conducted by speleologists from Trieste at the beginning of the 20th century when those explorers went as far as 80 m into its depth.  Explorations of SD Proteus  It was in the year 1973 that the members of Poreƒç's Caving Club Proteus went to the lower part of the cave where they discovered a passage which made it possible for them to go as far as the underground lakes, i. e. to what is today considered to be the total depth of the cave. It was at their initiative that, in 1986, the Baredine Cave was, owing to its very special characteristics and exquisite beauty, proclaimed a monument of nature.  Newer explorations and valorization  The first concrete efforts to adapt the cave started at the beginning of the 90's. In May 1995 the cave was opened for tourist visits. In the following years the infrastructure was improved, which created conditions for a pleasant stay in and around the cave. Since the first proper explorations in the Baredine cave in 1973 until today there have been additional explorations with the aim of finding new, unexplored spaces. Surface pottery has been collected in soil sediments bearing witness to the fact that human beings entered the cave in ancient times and used to live there. Subterranean fauna has also been explored and studied.

Myers was born as a free black, though Maryland was a slave state. Since the state of Maryland did not offer public education for African American youth, Myers had to acquire his early education from a private day school run by Rev. John Fortie. At the age of 16 he began work as a caulker, sealing seams in ships. In the 1850s Myers married Emma V. Morgan, who died in 1868. With her they had three children, including political activist George A. Myers. He later married Sarah E. Deaver. In 1860, Myers left caulking to work in a grocery business leading him to set up a short lived co-operative grocery in 1864. He returned to caulking in 1865. After the American Civil War competition for jobs led to strikes and protests by white workers, forcing over 1000 black caulkers to lose their jobs. Myers proposed the workers collectively pool resources and form a co-operative shipyard and railway, the Chesapeake Marine Railway and Dry Dock Company, to provide themselves with employment. The co-operative, opening in February 1866, was initially a great success, employing over 300 black workers. Myers and others also established the Colored Caulkers Trade Union Society in 1868, to which he was elected President. The National Labor Union took interest, inviting the Colored Caulkers Trade Union Society to their annual convention. The move was significant for what had previously been an all-white union, but black workers continued to face opposition to membership. In response the Colored National Labor Union was established in 1869, with Myers as President. He was succeeded in 1872 as President by Frederick Douglass. Following his departure from the CFNL Myer's continued working and contributing to the labor movement. He became increasingly involved in the Republican Party during the 1870s. He worked as both a Customs Service agent and as a postal service agent under President Ulysses S. Grant's abolitionist Postmaster General John Creswell. He was the first known African American postal inspector, serving from 1870 until 1879, after which he returned to operate a coal yard in Baltimore. \\"Myer's also organized and became President of the Maryland Colored State Industrial Fair Association, the Colored Business Men's Association of Baltimore, the Colored Building and Loan Association, and the Aged Ministers Home of the A.M.E. Church\\". The Frederick Douglass - Isaac Myers Maritime Park in Baltimore is named after Myers.

Today  The parish assumed its current configuration under Parish Administrator Msgr. John J. Miller, when St. Michael's absorbed the neighboring parish of Immaculate Conception in July 2011.http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001820.php Msgr. Miller served as parochial administrator at St. Michael's from early 2011 until he was replaced in 2014 by the Rev. Arturo Chagala, who had been ordained in the Denver Archdiocese in 2013.http://catholicphilly.com/2014/06/news/local-news/clergy- assignment-changes-announced-7/ As of December 2019, the church has daily Mass at 8:30 a.m. Monday through Friday along with Masses on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. (English) and 11:30 a.m. (Spanish). All of these Masses are in the Main Church at St. Michael's. Additionally, beginning with the winter of 2017-18, due to heating problems in the parish's worship site at 1020 N. Front Street (Immaculate Conception Church ), Masses normally held there were celebrated in St. Michael's. Immaculate Conception never reopened for regular worship after this temporary closure. After several years of inactivity, except for irregular and occasional Masses (the last being a Mass for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, 2018), in October 2019, it was announced in a letter to parishioners that the Immaculate Conception church building would be closed because the repairs needed to reopen it were not affordable for the parish. Although the church building at 1020 N. Front Street was closed (with the plans to relegate it to non-sacred purposes, including a possible sale), the territory of the former parish of the Immaculate Conception, suppressed in 2011, remains part of the current parish of the Saint Michael. The Administrator at the time of the closing of the worship site, estimated there were less than 100 active parishioners in October 2019.  Founding The parish was founded in 1831, the first Catholic Church in the County of Philadelphia (but not within the Philadelphia City limits) on land purchased for $3,333.00.http://home.catholicweb.com/StMichaelsHistory/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=233596&From;=Home The cemetery connected to the church was the first Catholic cemetery in the Philadelphia area. The original pastor, who served from 1833 until 1843, was the Very Rev. Terence Donaghoe, who also founded the Sisters of Charity, BVM with Mother Mary Frances Clarke and invited them to teach in the parish school.  Destruction of the original church 350px The initial church was destroyed in the Nativist Riots of 1844. The unrest began when the Catholic Bishop Francis Kenrick petitioned the Public School Board to allow use of the Douay-Rheims (Catholic) translation of the Bible by Catholic students, instead of forcing them to use the Authorized (King James/Protestant) Version as did other students. A Nativist meeting to plan opposition to this initiative was stopped by the Irish Catholics and, following a second meeting in a local market which the Catholics considered their territory, violence broke out, during which an Irish Catholic was seriously injured and a Nativist killed after shots were fired from inside a local Irish Catholic volunteer fire house, the Hibernia Hose Company, as well as by Nativists on the street. The riots were only stopped after two Catholic churches, St. Michael's and St. Augustine's, burned, when, the following day, cannon were set up in front of the city's Catholic Cathedral (St. John the Evangelist) and General George Cadwalader, who was in command of the state militia, threatened to shoot on anyone continuing the disorder. It took several years for the church to be rebuilt, along the pattern of the original church, using an award of $27,000.00 granted in December, 1847 in a suit against Philadelphia County for failing to protect the church and surrounding buildings. Several long term changes resulted from the 1844 riots. First, the \\"outlying\\" districts of Philadelphia County, like Kensington, Northern Liberties and Southwark (where St. Philip Neri Church was also almost destroyed by fire) were incorporated into the City of Philadelphia and the police and fire departments in those areas unified with the city's. Secondly, Bishop Kenrick, dropped the tactic of trying to influence the treatment of Catholic students in the public schools in favor of creating exclusive parochial schools for Catholic children. Changes of population and area The membership of the church, at that time largely an Irish parish adjacent to the handloom weaving mills in Kensington where both Catholic and Protestant Irish immigrants worked, grew exponentially after the Great Famine in the late 1840s, but, as the surrounding area saw the founding of additional Catholic churches, its territory and population dropped as the Catholics in the area were divided among other parishes. Today, the parish boundaries extend broadly from West Kensington into Kensington, Fishtown and Northern Liberties, increasing notably after it assumed the territory of the neighboring Immaculate Conception Parish in 2011 when that parish was suppressed and made a worship site of St. Michael's.https://web.archive.org/web/20120826231054/http://archphila.org/parishes/8270.php In addition, there is a significant Latino population, mostly concentrated in West Kensington, along with other ethnic groups in the remaining parts of the parish. 350px  Links with educational institutions the church does not designate a particular parochial school. La Salle University began at the St. Michael‚Äôs School at Second and Jefferson Streets in Philadelphia when the Christian Brothers opened a school there and taught their first classes on July 20, 1858. Initially known as the ‚Äú Select School,‚Äù it eventually took the name ‚ÄúChristian Brothers Academy.‚Äù In 1863, the Academy became the college preparatory division of what was then La Salle College. In 1867, La Salle moved to Juniper and Filbert Streets; ultimately, the campus relocated to the Olney Section of Philadelphia in 1929. The High School separated from the College and moved to Wyndmoor in the 1960s. However, the connection with LaSalle lives on in a new school opened several years ago in one of the parish buildings. Several years after St. Michael's Parish School closed, in 2000, the vacant convent was converted for use as LaSalle Academy of Philadelphia, a grade school meant to serve children from the immediate area of the parish which includes among its trustees members of the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of St. Joseph. It features class sizes of 15 or less, with an 11-month academic calendar.  Other buildings  The church formerly hosted St. Michael's Business School, which it closed in the early 1990s due to a lack of students and the curriculum becoming obsolete. In 2013 the church announced it intended to sell the building, which had been previously used by charter school and La Salle Academy.

He attained the rank of brigadier general, and was most notable for his World War I service as commander of the 87th Division. Biography He was born at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on August 22, 1857, the son of Stewart Van Vliet and Sarah Jane Brown. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1876. Van Vliet participated in the Indian Wars, including the Geronimo campaign. He served as commander of Fort Davis in Nome, Alaska prior to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During the war, he served as commander of Company G, 10th Infantry Regiment in Cuba, including the attack on Santiago, at which he was wounded. He received the Silver Star and Purple Heart. Van Vliet commanded several posts and garrisons, including: Fort Slocum, New York; the federal prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, California; and Fort McIntosh, Texas. In 1911 and 1912 he commanded the 25th Infantry Regiment and he commanded the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1913 and 1914. During the Veracruz expedition, Van Vliet was served as second in command of US forces under Frederick Funston. During World War I, Van Vliet's physical condition as a result of his old wound prevented him from serving in France. He was promoted to brigadier general, and assigned as commander of the 173rd Infantry Brigade and the 87th Division during their pre-deployment training at Camp Pike, Arkansas. Van Vliet's ill health prevented him from serving with his brigade in France, so in September 1918 he was assigned to command of the Student Army Training Corps unit at the City College of New York. Death and burial In retirement, Van Vliet resided in Shrewsbury, New Jersey and New Smyrna, Florida. He died at the Palma Hotel in New Smyrna on October 27, 1943. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section East, Site 3447. Family Van Vliet was the husband of Harriet \\"Hattie\\" Stephens (1861-1929). Their children included: Sarita (1889-1965), the wife of Lieutenant Colonel David Perry Wood; Stewart (1885-1956), a New Jersey newspaper editor and columnist; Colonel Robert C. Van Vliet Jr. (1893-1943); and Marguerite (1895-1982), the wife of Major General Robert L. Spragins.

Prior to the Iraq War, the ancient city of Al Hillah was home to numerous bases for the Iraqi Medina division of the Iraqi Republican Guard. As a main objective of the invasion of Iraq was to disable the Republican Guard, this made Al Hillah an important target for Coalition forces, as well as the fact that Al Hillah lay in the path of the planned Coalition advance on Najaf.Hillah#U.S. invasion of Iraq The Battle Fighting in Al Hillah began on 31 March 2003, when two companies of the US 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division crossed into southern Al Hillah from Al Kifl, at approximately 0600 AST. There, US forces advanced along Highway 8, protected with air cover. At 0630, an American AH-64 came under fire from Iraqi soldiers entrenched in bunkers, and by 0640 American soldiers were engaged in combat with Iraqi infantry. What followed was intensely fierce urban combat as Coalition forces advanced into Al Hillah, under fire from Republican Guard soldiers and Iraqi infantry.http://lzsally.com/archives/Historian/STRIKE_History_for_31_March_-_06_April_2013.pdf After nearly 15 minutes of intense gun battle, US ground units halted near the campus of Babylon Community College, where they exchanged small arms and artillery fire with two entrenched Republican Guard infantry battalions, two artillery batteries, and extensive air defense systems. For five hours, Coalition forces were engaged in close combat fighting, at times so fierce that the American M1 Abrams tanks couldn't aim their machine guns low enough to engage Iraqi troops. As fighting raged, Apache helicopters conducted numerous attack runs and fire missions on Iraqi defenses until all their weaponry and nearly all their fuel had been expended. 8 Apaches returned to their base damaged, with repair teams reported to have been pulling unexploded RPGs out of the skins of the helicopters. Many pilots had been injured, and one seriously injured pilot later received a Purple Heart for wounds he sustained during the battle. At 1730 hours AST, US Colonel Joseph Anderson ordered Coalition forces to withdraw. One US soldier had been killed in the battle, but the fighting had cost the Iraqis 1,200 or more soldiers killed or wounded, one Republican Guard infantry battalion, one armored company, two field artillery batteries, and one antiaircraft battery. Following the withdrawal, Coalition aircraft launched an assault on the remaining defenses in Al Hillah. Numerous cluster bombs were dropped, causing military and civilian casualties. Following the bombing, Coalition forces advanced into Al Hillah and captured the city by the end of 1 April, encountering sparse resistance. With Al Hillah captured, Coalition forces were clear to advance towards Najaf. Aftermath Small pockets of resistance, composed mostly of Iraqi irregulars, continued to hold out in Al Hillah until 11 April, but nearly all Iraqi military resistance in the city had been annihilated and the Republican Guard no longer posed a serious threat to Coalition forces.

The game features extensive use of Internet memes; for example, the player character is a stick figure with a trollface for a head, and the levels are made up of Lenny faces. The game was designed to appeal to both hardcore and casual audiences, but has been widely criticized both before and after its release for its perceived low quality. The game was removed from the Nintendo eShop on March 3, 2015 by artist Carlos Ramirez due to copyright infringing use of the trollface by the developers. Gameplay In Meme Run, the player controls a stick figure with a trollface for a head. The character runs through procedurally generated 2D levels, jumping over and sliding under obstacles, until it is trapped between the continually sliding screen and an obstacle or falls into a bottomless pit. The player's total of \\"swag points\\" continually increases, and after a run, the player can post their high score to Miiverse. The levels are made up of the repeated \\"Lenny face\\" Internet meme, and other memes appear throughout the game, such as a \\"wombo combo!\\" scream when the player collects an item‚Äîa reference to a Super Smash Bros. Melee match recording on YouTube. Development and release Meme Run was developed by Ninja Pig Studios, a small indie outfit consisting of 20-year-old (in 2014) developer Jordan Schuetz and his brother. The game contains copious use of memes, described as an \\"Internet meme-infused infinite runner (Yes, really)\\" by Joystiq. It was intended to appeal to both hardcore and casual gaming audiences by featuring both simple, intuitive controls and substantial difficulty once the character has run far enough. The game was widely criticized before its release; in response, Schuetz responded that it was a parody intended to \\"troll\\" users and called it \\"Game of the Year 2014\\". However, Schuetz's friends in college enjoyed the game, and its description contains the quote \\"Tyrone rated this game 8/8 which means it's not b8 so come play m8.\\" It was released on December 18, 2014 for the Wii U's eShop online service, their second eShop release after the poorly received puzzle game IQ Test. Schuetz has stated that Ninja Pig's future plans are \\"a secret\\". On January 5, 2015, Meme Run was put on Steam Greenlight in an attempt to release the game on Steam, which never came to fruition due to the shutdown of Steam Greenlight on June 6, 2017. On January 19, 2015, \\"Bigley Mode\\" was added. By pressing B on the main menu, the user would be able to play as a character known as Bigley, an in-joke within the Miiverse community relating to the Metroid character Ridley and the reasons given for his absence from the video games Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. On March 3, 2015, 'Meme Run' was pulled from the Wii U eShop with no public announcement. Its Miiverse community page was also taken down. A Reddit post purporting to be the copyright holder of the \\"troll face\\" meme claims he sent a DMCA notice to Nintendo to take down Meme Run. According to Schuetz, Meme Run failed Nintendo's legal tests at least three times. Reception Prior to release, Mark Serrels of Kotaku called the game \\"terrifying\\" and opined that \\"just watching this video game being played is a genuine insight into what it is to be insane.\\" The game was panned upon release, NintendoLife staff writer Lee Meyer gave Meme Run an extremely negative review, calling it possibly \\"one of the worst releases on any gaming platform this year\\" and stating that it was certainly not worth its price of US$4.99. Meyer found the copious use of memes to be unpleasant and jarring and also criticized the finicky controls. He suggested that its intention may have been to lampoon the proliferation of banal Internet memes, but felt that it had not succeeded.  Sequel  On July 23, 2020, a sequel was released on Steam for Windows and macOS, titled Meme Run 2. It features similar gameplay to the original but with non-copyrighted content.

He soon started studying with Alexander Bain, inventor and engineer, and worked with him on a printing telegraph. He joined the Electric Telegraph Company in 1847, travelling around the country and setting up and managing new telegraphy stations. In 1855, at the age of 23, he joined the GWR, becoming the first Telegraph Superintendent of the company. He set about developing a complete system of block signalling using telegraphy, supported by a book of rules and instructions. This system was first applied on the Metropolitan and District railway, followed soon by the GWR, whose Chairman, Daniel Gooch, disapproved of mechanical safety devices, claiming that they reduced the \\"natural vigilance\\" of the operating staff.Adrian Vaughan, A Pictorial Record of Great Western Signalling. Oxford Publishing Co., 1984, p.10. On the GWR, Spagnoletti's block telegraph instrument was particularly useful on single- track lines where it allowed more trains to be run.Vaughan, 1984, p.10. It became the foundation of all block signalling used on almost all British railways, and on the railways of many other countries. In 1866 Spagnoletti devised a system of communication between passengers and the guards of a train, consisting of a handle which a passenger could turn in the compartment in which they were travelling. This activated a system of alarm bells in the train and also caused a red disc to be shown on the outside of the carriage in which the alarm had been used.D.Smith, The Biographical Dictionary of Britain's Railway Personalities, Organisations and Events 1597-1923. Glebe Publications, 2007, p.705. He continued to develop various devices and inventions applicable to signalling and railways, and also in other areas such as fire safety. After retiring as Telegraph Superintendent of the GWR in 1892 (following a long illness), he was appointed as Consulting Electrical Engineer for the railway. In 1893 Spagnoletti became managing director of the Phonopore Company. The phonopore system had been in use since 1885 and allowed telephone calls in addition to telegraphy over an existing telegraph cable. Throughout his career Spagnoletti acted in various advisory roles. He was consulting engineer for a number of railway companies (Metropolitan and District, City and South London, and Central London), and also the London Electric Omnibus Company. After the Telegraph Act 1868 (which enabled the nationalisation of telegraph companies in the UK), Spagnoletti advised the government on compensation due to the companies involved. He was on the organising committee or jury, or both, for the electrical sections of various international exhibitions including the Paris World's Fair (1878), the first International Exposition of Electricity (Paris 1881), the International Health Exhibition (London, 1884), the International Inventions Exhibition (London, 1885), and the Chicago World's Fair (1893). In 1874, Spagnoletti's views on contemporary signalling developments were recorded during a discussion of a paper, \\"On the fixed signals of railways\\" by R.C. Rapier read before members of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 31 March of that year:  Inventions and developments  In the early days of telegraphy it was found that the effects of telluric currents and lightning strikes could have an adverse effect on the permanent magnets used in the needles used to display signals. The permanent magnet was surrounded by a coil of wire which carried the signal, causing the needle to deflect. A strong current in the telegraph cable, arising from external sources such as a lightning strike, could weaken the permanent magnet and occasionally reverse the direction of the magnetic field. The \\"false reversal\\" of telegraph signals used in railway signalling presented a great danger. In the Spagnoletti Induced Needle, patented in 1869, the permanent magnet was replaced with a soft iron core which was magnetised by induction by a strong permanent magnet well away from the coil of wire. Although the needle would be deflected by a surge of current, the magnet would not be weakened or its polarity reversed. In 1862 Spagnoletti patented and produced the Spagnoletti disc block instrument, first used on the Metropolitan Railway when it opened in 1863, and which soon became standard on the GWR. In this block instrument, a disc, instead of a telegraph needle, oscillated between a pair of electromagnets to indicate \\"line clear\\" or \\"train on line\\" in a window at the bottom of the instrument's face. The indication \\"line blocked\\", the default position for block instruments, was displayed through one half of each of the other two indications being displayed in the window. Each indication was obtained by pressing on a key which was held down by a wire frame passing over the key shank (see illustration).G. Kichenside and A. Williams, Two Centuries of Railway Signalling, Oxford Publishing Co., 1998, p.45 . This type of instrument survived in use beyond the end of the GWR in 1948, and into the 21st century. The final operational Network Rail example, located in Banbury South signal box was finally decommissioned at 02:00 on 30 July 2016 shortly before the box's demolition.For example, Spagnoletti instruments were in use in 2013 in Abergavenny signal box, as illustrated in: M. Rhodes, Resignalling Britain, Mortons Media Group, 2015, p. 39. .https://www.networkrail.co.uk/news/2016/feb/chiltern-line-to-close-nine-days- summer-railway-upgrade-banbury/ A Spagnoletti block telegraph instrument.The red and white keys were \\"pegged\\" or secured to give a \\"Train on Line\\" or \\"Line Clear\\" indication.Vaughan,1984, p.12. He also developed a repeater for semaphore signals (where the status of signals not directly visible from the signal box could be displayed) and a semaphore signal lamp checker (warning if the light of a signal was extinguished). He also introduced electric lighting at a number of stations, including Paddington. He designed a portable telegraph machine, which was always carried on Queen Victoria's royal train, in case of breakdown or emergency. The machine was under Spagnoletti's care so he always travelled on the royal train. Spagnoletti also designed a results board for Ascot racecourse, and a town fire alarm, used in a number of London streets, that was regarded as being as effective as it was ugly. His talents extended to inventing a system of road construction using interlocking blocks of precast concrete laid on a bed of compressed sand and bound together with molten pitch. This method was adopted by the London County Council.Vaughan, 1979  Society of Telegraph Engineers  Charles Spagnoletti was an early member of the Society of Telegraph Engineers (formed in 1871), joining in 1872. The society became the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians in 1880, with Spagnoletti as president in 1885, and then became the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889. Spagnoletti was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Physical Society of London, the Royal Society of Arts, and the Imperial Institute. Family life Like his father and grandfather, Spagnoletti was also musically gifted and wrote and composed songs. He had a good tenor voice which was put to good use when Sir William Preece demonstrated the first Edison phonograph in London in 1878. Spagnoletti recorded a song and the national anthem. Spagnoletti married Caroline Charlotte Duffield (1829‚Äì1903), a widow, in 1853. They had three daughters and two sons. His brother (Charles), son (James), great-nephew (Philip), and Philip's son (Robert) all pursued careers in electricity. Spagnoletti died of pneumonia on 28 June 1915 at Hampstead and was buried at Hampstead Cemetery. References Further reading *G. Kichenside and A.

Background During 2014, Boko Haram militants conducted a number of attacks on villages located within northern Cameroon, killing at least 40 government soldiers and recruiting hundreds of people into the organization. Incident On 26 December 2014, Boko Haram insurgents killed a Cameroonian soldier and wounded three others on the Waza- Mora highway. A military vehicle was also seized in the attack. On 28 December 2014, Cameroonian troops repelled four simultaneous Boko Haram raids into the towns of Makary, Amchide, Limani, Guirvidig, Waza and Achigachia, located in Cameroon's Far North Region. The Cameroonian air force bombed an insurgent camp in Soueram killing 53 militants, while at the same time militants carried an assault on the Mbaljuel village which left 30 civilians dead. The bombing prompted the militants to abandon the Achigachia military base they had previously occupied. On 29 December 2014, the Cameroonian military launched a counter offensive on militant bases in the towns of Chogori and Waza. A total of 41 militants and one soldier were killed during the incident, according to Cameroonian officials.

It is native to countries of western tropical Africa from Senegal east and south to Angola. Stems are verrucose or warty and somewhat rubbery. The 1-3 inflorescences are terminal, and peduncles 2.5‚Äì6 cm; the spathe is green, mucronate, 2‚Äì3.5 cm; the spadix is pale yellow to orange, constricted near the base, often exserted, stipe of about 4 mm; ovary is unilocular and uni-ovulate; fruiting spadix terminating in the male portion; berries red, roughly spherical, 10-12 x 8 mm. The sap, leaves and bark, and infusions, decoctions and pulp prepared from these, are used to treat a variety of ailments and conditions - as analgesic for earache, toothache, tonsillitis and stomach complaints. It is also used as an anti-emetic, for various skin conditions, taken during pregnancy as an anti-abortifacient, and for venereal diseases. The sap is a skin-irritant, rich in alkaloids and leading to its use as a fish poison and as veterinary medicine for goat ailments. Some African tribes mix maize seeds with powdered Culcasia roots and seeds and claim that better crops result, probably due to Culcasia's insecticidal and repellent properties. Leaves are fragrant and a source of coumarin, a perfume ingredient.

A piano ballad, the song is regarded as Keys' response to the police brutality controversies, namely the killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, that have caused nationwide protests in the United States.  Background  Keys was one of the many artists who, by releasing a song publicly, reacted to the grand jury decision not to indict the police officer responsible for the death of Eric Garner. Although released the same night the no-indictment decision was announced, the song was written months earlier. In an interview with The New York Times, Keys stated that she was inspired to write the song after being moved by the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. The song was posted on Keys' YouTube account on December 3, 2014. Keys later tweeted that \\"I wrote #WeGottaPray awhile ago, yet the lyrics have never meant more to me than during this time\\".  Composition  \\"We Gotta Pray\\" is a three-minute ballad and is driven by \\"a single sparse piano accompaniment\\". In the song, Keys sings \\"Violence everywhere, barely holding on, what the hell going on, do you know who you are\\". Additionally, Keys sings about sirens and violence being everywhere. Andrew R. Chow of The New York Times described the composition as having a \\"hymnal quality\\" that the song features \\"declarations of uplift and self-affirmation\\" such as ‚ÄúWe are extraordinary people / Living ordinary lives‚Äù. Justin Davis of Complex wrote that \\"We Gotta Pray\\" is a song that \\"brings attention to the troubling social issues we live in today\\". As described by Vibe, Keys encourages to \\"keep the faith and continue on a righteous path in life\\" and \\"spreads the message of prayer to the world\\". Billboard compared it to Keys' previous single \\"We Are Here\\", and noted that it is another \\"socially conscious\\" ballad from the singer.

Clarage, eds. (Oryx Press, 1999), \\"Howard Walter Blakeslee\\" Blakeslee was born in 1880 to Jesse Walter Blakeslee and Jennie (Howard) in New Dungeness (now Dungeness), Washington. After attending the University of Michigan, he became, in 1901, a news writer (soon after, feature writer) for the Detroit Journal. Between 1903 and 1905, he was a sports writer for Chicago and Detroit newspapers. He joined the Associated Press in 1906. Between then and 1916, he was a bureau chief in New Orleans, Atlanta, and Dallas. He was news editor in Chicago from 1916 to 1926, then moved to New York where, after two years as photo service editor, his title became Science Editor, AP's first. Blakeslee (along with four other reporters from different papers) won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for the group's collective coverage of science at Harvard University's tercentenary celebration. A better-known winner that year was Margaret Mitchell, who won for Gone With the Wind. Blakeslee reported extensively on the atomic bomb in the immediate post-war era and was among the group of reporters who witnessed the early tests at Yucca Flat. Also interested in the subject of atomic power, his book publications include Miracle of Atomics (1945), The Atomic Future (1946), and Atomic Progress: The Hydrogen Race (1951). In addition to the Pulitzer, his awards include the National Headliners Club award (1940), the George Westinghouse Science Writers award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1946). The Howard W. Blakeslee Award of the American Heart Association is named in his honor.Circulation, vol. 6, p. 799 (November, 1952) Blakeslee was married twice, first in 1906 to Marguerite Fortune and second, after the death of his first wife, to Rosamund Robinson in 1936. Blakeslee and Rosamund had three children: Howard, Rosamund, and Alan. His son from his first marriage, Alton Blakeslee, eventually succeeded him as science editor at AP, retiring in 1985.

Built in 1921, it is a three-room pub with Art Nouveau decor that underwent major renovation in 2012. The Albion is jointly operated by four North Wales breweries and real ales from these breweries and other beers are served through eight hand pumps. The Albion Ale House was named the 2013 Wales Pub of the Year by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), and named one of the world's best bars by The Guardian. The four breweries that co-run The Albion are Conwy Brewery of Llysfaen, Bragdy Nant of Llanrwst, Great Orme Brewery of Llandudno, and Purple Moose Brewery of Porthmadog.  History  The Albion was built in 1921 on the site of a previous pub. By mid-2010 the ale house was not profitable and had fallen into disrepair. It was sold by its owner, Punch Taverns, to Arthur Ellis, a local businessman. The Albion remained closed for a year while renovation work was carried out at a total cost of ¬£100,000. Ellis arranged for the four local breweries to co-operate in running the pub on its reopening. The Albion Ale House reopened in February 2012. The renovated pub received the English Heritage Conservation Award in the 2014 CAMRA Pub Design Awards. The interior of the Albion appears on the cover of the Britain's Best Real Heritage Pubs guide published by CAMRA.

He was a pioneer in scientifically defining and advancing inventiveness, based on the psychology of creative thinking and imagination.Parnes & Harding, 2006, p. 127.Pulos, 1990, p. 185.  Biography  John Arnold was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He received the B.A. in psychology in 1934 from the University of Minnesota and a M.S. in mechanical engineering in 1940 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Subsequently, he served in industry as a mechanical designer and research engineer. He taught at MIT from 1942 to 1957 and was the founder, director, and sole member of MIT's \\"Creative Engineering Laboratory\\".Kays et al.1963.Make It New: A History of Silicon Valley Design pg.119 In the 1950s Arnold sought to shift the meaning of design from being \\"the language used to tell fabrication and assembly where to make their cuts\\" to \\"the language of innovation\\", by which engineers expressed their imagination.Hapgood, 1993, p. 110. He moved to Stanford University in 1957 with a joint appointment as professor of mechanical engineering and professor of business administration. He was founding director of the Design Division of the Mechanical Engineering Department, continuing to formulate and teach about creativity in engineering.Stanford University, 1957‚Äì1963. He died at the age of 50 of a heart attack while traveling in Italy on sabbatical; he had planned to write a book on the philosophy of engineering.The Stanford Daily, 1963, p.1. Arnold taught summer seminars in creativity for manufacturing engineers, military researchers, and industrial designers (1953‚Äì1956 at MIT and continuing at Stanford). The 1956 summer program was particularly influential, including a presentation by R. Buckminster Fuller on the \\"comprehensive designer\\", J. P. Guilford's concept of measuring and developing creativity,Parnes & Harding, 2006, pp. 151‚Äì168. and A. H. Maslow's \\"Emotional Blocks to Creativity\\",Maslow, 1962. with considerable attention given to Alex Faickney Osborn's notion of \\"brainstorming\\". Arnold consulted for government agencies and large American companies, including General Electric, Ford, Alcoa Aluminum, Corning Glass, RCA, and Bell Laboratories, advising how to manage \\"creative personnel\\" for new project development and increased R&D; productivity. He was a major consultant for the General Motors Corporation's AC Spark Plug Division creativity program, one of the first industrial organizations to promote creative thinking.Tudor, 1999, p. 321.The Times (San Mateo), 1963, p. 21.Smith & Grotz, 1959, pp. 33‚Äì34. On his passing, Arnold's Stanford colleagues described him as \\"an uncommon man ... a visionary thinker who set trends in design education\\". They said he was \\"warmly human, an outstanding and articulate speaker ... sought by many groups to contribute to their programs\\". Stanford's Design Group, hosted by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, continues to develop Arnold's design methodology, combining creativity and technology with a \\"concern for human values and the needs of society\\".Stanford Engineering Design Group.  Early career and interests  John Arnold's extraordinarily broad and diverse activities demonstrated his vision of what it means to work and live as a creative person. After graduating from college in 1934 and unable to find a job as a psychologist, he worked as a night watchman in an oil plant. Reading the technical reports laying about, he became interested in engineering. This motivated him to become part owner of a garage, where he gained practical knowledge and confidence to get a job as an assistant designer for a company making industrial machinery. That experience convinced him that he needed to learn the mechanical principles that made devices work, leading to acquiring an MIT engineering master's degree, which he completed in three years.Hunt, 1955, p. 198. Subsequently, on joining the MIT faculty Arnold first taught courses in engineering mechanics, but his interests in teaching shifted to the process of engineering design. He became known internationally as an innovator in educational philosophy. Bringing his understanding of psychology into the design process, his notion of \\"creative engineering\\" showed engineering designers how to approach and solve problems creatively.Arnold, 1959a/2016. Appointed in 1955 as MIT's first educational television coordinator, he directed the program for two years, involving more than a hundred broadcasts. He was also President of the MIT Faculty Club and participated in the MIT Science Fiction Society.MIT Science Fiction Society, 1955.The Tech, 1954. While at MIT, Arnold designed and built a substantial portion of his home in Wenham, Massachusetts. Besides cultivating his fields and raising sheep,Hunt, 1955, p. 200. he was an amateur printer and photographer. He built miniature railroads, played tennis and the violin, and was chairman of the town school board. Arnold's interest in architecture is reflected in his friendship with William Wurster. Arnold worked directly with Wurster's partner Theodore Bernardi in designing his California home near Stanford. He included a large basement shop with a dark room and printing press, which he used to produce handouts for his classes.Arnold, 1957.  Perspective on creativity  Arnold was well known for applying and devising heuristics for studying a problem and generating novel engineering solutions.Kizilos-Clift, 2009.Pandora, 2006. By the late 1950s, a literature search on the subject of creativity would lead to his contributions.Smith & Grotz, 1959, p. 33. Basing design processes and teaching about design on psychology and contextual factors, Arnold demonstrated how the scientific method could be applied for improving creativity.Smith & Grotz, 1959, p. 34. Arnold sought to balance the then prevalent analytical approach to technology with an approach based on synthesis, namely combining different perspectives for understanding and solving a problem. As a generalist, he advocated a broad perspective, envisioning the creative process as essential in life. He stated that challenges of \\"the modern age\\" called for engineers to be bold, devising entirely new kinds of solutions. Arnold broke with the prevalent approach of giving engineering students highly specified problems that by definition have only one correct answer. In practical life, design begins with investigating a situation and learning about the environment to define what people need. Arnold said that the creative process \\"is an intellectual process ... whereby you combine and re-combine all your past experience or selected aspects of it ... [and] end up with a new combination, a new pattern, a new configuration that somehow satisfies some basic expressed or implied need of a man.\\"Arnold, 1959b, p. 35. Arnold stated that the creative process is a particular kind of problem-solving, distinguished from decision-making by four requirements that make the result creative: #a better combination, not just something different #tangible, something you can see, or feel or react to in some fashion, not just an idea #forward-looking in time, relating to society's needs, not merely \\"recreative\\" #a \\"synergetic\\" quality‚Äîthe value achieved in the combination is much greater than the sum of the parts (a multiplicative effect). The value of a creative result was measured by increased function, improved performance, and lowered cost. The most important aspect of the creative process was figuring out what people need and thus would want to buy.Arnold, 1959b, p. 37. Arnold believed we can improve creativity by scientific understanding of the inventive process and improving it so it became more organized and deliberate with a step-by-step approach.Arnold, 1959b, p. 38. He defined a framework for the creative process involving a combination of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation in three phases: #Question and observe (preparation), #Associate (production), and #Predict (decision-making). Arnold viewed these phases as a kind of checklist for guiding creative work. In accord with his notion of being systematic, Arnold believed a machine could be developed that might assist an engineer in generating ideas by enumerating all possible cross- combinations and associations of different aspects or perspectives for describing and solving a problem.Arnold, 1959b, p. 42. To prompt his own thinking, Arnold would refer to a deck of cards with probes adopted from Osborn, e.g., what could be rearranged, reversed, or put to other uses?Arnold, 1962b, p. 254.Adams, 1976, pp. 87‚Äì88.  Importance of individual thought in the creative process  During the Creativity Conference of 1958,Smith & Grotz, 1959. participants debated the role of the individual versus the group in the creative process. Arnold's philosophy of creativity and design emphasized the individual because \\"Every new combination of values ... is formed in the mind of an individual man.\\"Arnold, 1959b, p. 44. While acknowledging that some engineering activities are best undertaken as a group activity to get feedback for ideas, he was critical of research directors who brought engineers together without concern for their individual competence.Arnold, 1959b, pp. 36‚Äì37. Accordingly, he advocated personal development first and foremost, providing guidelines for self-reflection and idea generation,Arnold, 1962a, p. 138. a form of metacognition. According to Arnold, some people believed that individuals could not invent because society and the sciences had become too complex‚Äî\\"no man can know all and therefore no man can invent.\\" Consequently, these people overemphasize teamwork. Arnold said such efforts will fail because \\"the creative process is an individual process and, as John Steinbeck said, 'it lies in the lonely mind of a man.'\\" Arnold's stressed that society needed engineers who could form and justify their own thoughts. He was concerned that teams sometimes inhibited or obstructed creativity: \\"What comes out of a team or a committee is the most daring idea that the least daring man can accept.\\" In the ensuing debate, Smith agreed that this was a universal business problem.Smith & Grotz, 1959, p. 45. Irving A. Taylor, social psychologist, asserted that in the associative, \\"productive\\" phase, contributions by individuals in a group brainstorming session could be synergetic. But he generally agreed that the greatest creative accomplishments (such as a Picasso painting) were inherently individual endeavors.Taylor, 1959, p. 60. M. F. Agha, a consultant art director and designer, argued that while it is true a group of individuals may produce nothing, working in groups was how business was done, and such practices were inherent in the \\"economic and cultural fabric\\" of society. He illustrated the social dynamics by a story of \\"Kibbitzers\\" who collaborated to develop an advertisement for a new product. At the same time, he admitted progress could be impaired by self-proclaimed experts, whom he called \\"Tsitzers\\" because their only effect was to squelch ideas, saying \\"Tsk, Tsk\\".Agha, 1959, p. 86. Despite his philosophical stand on the importance of the individual, Arnold's projects included some full-group sessions and small groups working together. Furthermore, his case material emphasized that specialists of different disciplines, including psychologists, engineers, economists, and politicians‚Äîalthough not working together in the same room‚Äîdid exchange questions and information necessary for defining and solving problems. Arnold illustrated this collaborative aspect of the creative process in great detail in the Arcturus IV Case Study.Arnold, 1953a.Arnold, 1953c/2016.  The Arcturus IV case study in creative engineering  Arnold's philosophy of design was first formulated and taught in \\"Creative Engineering\\" courses at MIT in the 1951‚Äì52 school year.Arnold, 1953b, p. 12. He developed a case study called Arcturus IV that gained considerable attention in the public press,Howe, 1952. but its humanistic perspective was new and controversial. The New York Times obituary stated that Arnold's \\"highly imaginative classroom methods to stimulate creative thinking ... caused a stir among traditional educators and conservative engineering leaders.\\"New York Times, 1963. The Arcturus IV Case Study posited a fictitious planet around the star Arcturus with beings, called Methanians, for whom the students were to design marketable products. This ground-breaking use of science fiction in engineering education was based on Arnold's ideas that, first, thinking creatively could be taught and improved by practice, and second, designing for an unfamiliar, imaginary world would jolt engineers to change how they approached problems. Thus he viewed imagining as a kind of skill that could be exercised. The Arcturus setting required the mechanical engineering students to set aside personal experience and assumptions to understand and design for the needs of beings very different from themselves‚Äî\\"the inhabitants were a bird-like race that breathed methane, had three eyes (one X-ray) three fingers and very low sales resistance\\".Smith & Grotz, 1959, p. 33 The students' task was to design tools and appliances for these beings. In particular, Arnold said that he sought to unsettle \\"preconceived notions about man-machine relationships and to strengthen the influence of environment on design\\".Arnold, 1953b, pp. 16‚Äì18. Translated back to Earthlings, Arnold was promoting a humanistic approach sensitive to the physical setting and cultural practices‚Äîan early form of user-centered design. His approach was motivated by his belief that the increasing complexity and number of the nation's and world's problems required more attention to what society needed, requiring a new way of analyzing situations. This challenge and responsibility extended beyond product design courses to other disciplines. Arnold's MIT Product Design course was conducted as an informal seminar combining discussions, demonstrations, and laboratory work. These conveyed the nature of the creative process; tools used by creative engineers; and factors that should be considered. Together the exercise would demonstrate the effect of practice on improved imagination and confidence in solving challenging problems. Each student received a copy of the Arcturus IV 117 page case file, which proposed that the student was living a 1000 years in the future when traveling to distant planets in other star systems was routine, enabling trade with other beings. The file contained copies of correspondence of various fictitious agencies and people, presented \\"on specially prepared stationery and report forms, stamped and handled in the best businesslike manner\\" to create a realistic context. Students were employees of a design and manufacturing company, the Massachusetts Intergalactic Traders (MIT), which sought to design consumer goods for the Methanians. The initial problem was to devise which needs to satisfy. A special governmental bureau, the Terran Exporting Counsel Headquarters (TECH), had gathered information for use in trading with other planets. It covered biology, physiology, and culture of the Methanians in the context of the planet's characteristics. The students became involved in science fiction invention itself, as they had to provide new, but consistent information that might be required to design products implied by the psychology and daily needs of the Methanians. For example, students designed furniture and vehicles suitable for the Methanians' elongated physiology. Making the point of his pedagogical approach, Arnold asked, \\"Do you think that the average, present day Terranian designer gives as much thought to human limitations?\\"Arnold, 1953b, p. 23. A quarter (3 weeks) of the Creative Engineering course was devoted to the Arcturus project. Arnold observed that \\"time spent out in space\\" profoundly influenced the students in subsequent course exercises, such that students would become engaged in a broad and detailed consideration of relevant design factors.Arnold, 1953b, pp. 24‚Äì25. The science fiction exercise \\"jolted\\" the student, requiring an adjustment to thinking and methods that made subsequent learning easier: \\"He has to stretch his imagination to such a limit that it doesn't quickly shrink back to its former inconspicuous self.\\" Accused by some academic colleagues of \\"theatricalism and publicity-seeking\\",Hunt, 1955, p. 196. Arnold believed it was important for designers to develop daring and confidence against what he called \\"a vicious jury\\" that might destroy ideas. Arnold believed that the Arcturus IV case, because it raised issues about the planet and inhabitants that couldn't be resolved, would instill confidence in a student who proceeded deliberately and logically in designs based on principles. This experience would then help the student retain his self-confidence when a design jury found a mistake in his work. He wrote, \\"In the Arcturus case the student designer can always rationalize that he is as much entitled to his opinion as the jury is to theirs and everyone lives happily ever after.\\" Finally, Arnold observed that many of the engineers enjoyed science-fiction, so this first case study was fun. He said that the Creative Engineering Group at M.I.T. did not support the idea that \\"education must be solemn and serious\\". The Arcturus case served as an \\"ice-breaker\\" that made the students into friends. Following his philosophy of promoting creativity in all of life's endeavors, Arnold encouraged students to help formulate the course (including members of the MIT Science Fiction Society),The Tech. 1955. such that the design of the course itself became a case for the Creative Engineering Group to reflect upon.  Courses taught at Stanford  In his first two school years at Stanford University (1957‚Äì59), Arnold introduced and taught Mechanical Engineering Design, subsequently taught by others. Following the formation of the Design Division by Arnold, related courses were added by Robert McKim, Rapid Visualization and Product Design. During 1958‚Äì1963 Arnold taught graduate courses that viewed design more generally. Philosophy of Design emphasized the nature of the creative process and factors that influenced it. The course discussed the designer's \\"attitudes and viewpoints\\" and the \\"techniques of analysis, synthesis and evaluation\\". Human Factors in Design concerned \\"Man's strength and weaknesses in opposition to and/or in cooperation with machines\\", including \\"the transfer of information, energy, and matter between man and machine\\". Comprehensive Design was a seminar about actual design practice; it stressed \\"imagination tempered with sound engineering analysis and judgment\\". Starting in 1960, Arnold added a senior colloquium to his courses; it was intended particularly for students not in the Mechanical Engineering Department. This course, How to Ask a Question, was based on the claim that \\"Each of man's advances was started by a question. ... Knowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is sometimes more important than the eventual answers.\\"Arnold, 1962b, pp. 130‚Äì132. Starting in 1962, Arnold also taught Engineering Drawing, the \\"study and application of the language of vision as it applies to the engineer and scientist\\", as part of the general Engineering School curriculum. Because of his sabbatical in 1963, it was the only course he was scheduled to teach in 1963‚Äì64. Following Arnold's philosophy, in this year McKim started to offer a Design Project course that emphasized \\"the cross-discipline responsibilities of the designer\\"; follow-on semesters emphasized \\"economic and marketing determinants\\" and experimentation, leading to a working prototype.  Notable acknowledgements  James Adams in Conceptual Blockbusting: \\"I was first introduced to thinking about thinking by the late John E. Arnold, a pioneer in education and one of my all-time personal heroes. Quite a bit of the book reflects his thinking.\\"Adams, 1976, p. xi. Robert McKim in Experiences in Visual Thinking: \\"My greatest debt is to the late professor John E. Arnold, who not only suggested that I develop a visual-thinking course at Stanford (a course that has been a major testing ground for this book), but who also influenced me by his pioneering efforts to educate productive thinking.\\"McKim, 1972, p. vii.

Geography  view from the Rhein river The water castle is located at the Rheinfall, built on a small island in the Rhein river at the municipality of Neuhausen am Rheinfall in the Canton of Schaffhausen, opposite of the Laufen Castle in the canton of Z√ºrich. The Schl√∂ssli (twee for German Schloss, meaning castle) owes its name to the location on a small island, washed by the water of the Rheinfall, which used to be known as Werd, meaning literally a river island.  History  W√∂rth was first mentioned in the 13th century AD, serving up to the middle of the 19th century as a major transhipment point on the east-west trade route, that led from Lake Constance and Basel, and was interrupted by the Rheinfall waterfalls. The present castle was built in 1348 AD, according to the excavations by the archaeological team of the Canton of Schaffhausen in 2004. Like the predecessor building, which was built in the mid-11th century as Burg im Fischerh√∂lzli, it served as a customs house and that to secure the area, where the goods were transferred to evade the Rheinfall. Earliest owner of the Habsurg fief were the Herren von Jestetten, followed by the Schultheiss of Randenburg (1291) and the Herren von Fulach (1422), and in 1429 by the Kloster Allerheiligen Schaffhausen. After the monastery's abolition in 1524, W√∂rth was a department (German: Amt) of the city of Schaffhausen. In the late 1790s, a so-called Gertzler was the custodian of the then Schl√∂sschen W√∂rth. It was given as a so-called \\"Schupf-Lehn\\" (fief) by the Kloster Allerheiligen Schaffhausen along with the salmon fisheries, customs, vineyard, forest etc. The Gertzler moved the customs for the monastery and had to deliver 2/3 of the salmon catch. For subsistence, he was allowed to fell timber out of the forest, and had to pay a lease of 30 Thaler per year for the use of the vineyard and the fields. The term \\"Schlupf-Lehn\\" derives from the Swiss German word for \\"slide out\\", as the feudal hereditary could be revoked if the administrator did not meet its obligations to the monastery. When the railway was built, the water traffic route lost its importance, and the Canton of Schaffhausen rebuilt the building as a restaurant in 1835/36. The former customs station and Salmon farming was converted in the tourism promotional restaurant ¬´Caff√©- und Speisewirtschaft Schl√∂sschen W√∂rth¬ª, that was opened on 2 February 1837 (Candlemas). The construction costs for the renovation had to be paid by the former owner, the Allerheiligen Abbey in Schaffhausen.

On the north side a palace- like building was built, whose third floor consisted of a cantilevered clerestory timbered. In 1621 a stone floor replaced the clerestory. New floors were added, new windows broken, and the ring wall and gate was broken. As of today it houses the restaurant Schl√∂ssli W√∂rth that claims to be a gourmet restaurant, and also a gift shop and a fast food joint, connected with a terrace and a brilliant view of Rheinfall. W√∂rth is also the starting point of the Rheinfall tour boats.  Trivia  The castle was mentioned in the diary of Goethe on 18 September 1797, Schl√∂sschen W√∂rth: Ich ging hinein, um ein Glas Wein zu trinken. Alter Eindruck bey Erblickung des Mannes ... Goethe asked the custodian (Gertzler) about his work and documented the then conditions.

The first years of his tenure saw the creation of US military-political blocs, NATO, CENTO, SEATO; the Suez Crisis; the Hungarian uprising and the escalating crisis in Berlin. In 1957 Rudolf Abel, an illegal KGB technical agent posted in New York City was discovered by the FBI, in 1961 Konon Molody, another illegal spy, was uncovered in London by MI5. Sakharovsky was named \\"the father of international terrorism\\" by Ion Mihai Pacepa, due to his systematic approach to turning \\"grassroots\\" terrorism into a weapon weakening USSR's political enemies. Sakharovsky organized trainings for Palestinian terrorists on hijacking and bombing civilian airplanes and published propaganda journals in Arabic, reprinting antisemitic fakes such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to fuel the Arabic-Israeli conflict. as well as created a \\"scientific\\" approach to covert assassinations disguised as regular car accidents. Later life and Death From July 1971 to January 1975, he was senior advisor to the chairman of the KGB. Seriously ill, he suffered a stroke 1 February 1975 after which he retired. He died 12 November 1983 and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.

He began his college football career at Notre Dame, before transferring to the University of Florida as a graduate transfer. Zaire currently works for the sports media company Overtime (sports network) as on-air talent and as a producer. \\"Take a Look Inside Hoovers Championship Football Program\\" Early years Zaire attended Archbishop Alter High School in Kettering, Ohio. As a senior, he earned 2012 AP Ohio Division III Southwest District Offensive Player of the Year accolades with 1,990 yards passing, 1,120 yards on the ground and 33 total touchdowns (24 passing touchdowns and nine rushing touchdowns). He was rated by Rivals.com as a four-star recruit and was ranked as the third best Dual-threat quarterback in his class. Zaire committed to the University of Notre Dame to play college football. College career Notre Dame 2013 season Zaire did not play in any games as a freshman at Notre Dame in 2013. 2014 season Prior to his sophomore season in 2014, he competed with Everett Golson to be the starting quarterback. Golson won the job with Zaire as the backup.Notre Dame gets the 'right answer' from Malik Zaire He received his first extensive playing time against the USC Trojans, replacing Golson, who was benched. He completed 9 of 20 passes for 170 yards and a rushing touchdown in the game. After spending the entire season as Golson's backup, Zaire started the 2014 Music City Bowl. He completed 12 of 15 passes for 96 yards with one touchdown, and ran for 96 yards on 22 carries scoring one touchdown leading Notre Dame to a 31‚Äì28 victory over LSU and earning the game's MVP. 2015 season The Fighting Irish opened spring practice with an open competition at quarterback, but neither Zaire or Everett Golson separated themselves as the starter according to head coach Brian Kelly. However, after Golson decided to transfer and play his final season at Florida State University, Zaire was named the starting quarterback. In the second game of the season, against Virginia, Zaire fractured his ankle after a run. It was announced after the game that he would miss the rest of the season. 2016 season Zaire battled DeShone Kizer before the season for the starting quarterback position. Both shared snaps in the team's first game, a loss to Texas. Statistically Kizer had a far better game than Zaire, earning Kizer the starting quarterback position. Zaire played little during the remainder of the season. After graduating from Notre Dame in May 2017, Zaire announced that he had transferred to the University of Florida to play a fifth year in the 2017 season. Florida 2017 season Zaire started two games and appeared in four. He finished with an overall record of 0‚Äì2 as a starter, completing 57.1 percent of his passes for 349 yards with zero touchdowns and one interception. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2018 NFL Draft, Zaire was invited to attend the Jacksonville Jaguars' rookie minicamp on a tryout basis. He did not make the Jaguars roster.

Burke is a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He joined the Department of Chemistry in 2005 as assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor with tenure in 2011, and was promoted to professor in 2014. In 2009, he became an Early Career Scientist of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  Education  Burke earned his B.A. in 1998 with a degree in chemistry from Johns Hopkins University. While at Johns Hopkins, Burke did undergraduate research with Henry Brem and Gary H. Posner. He then moved to Harvard Medical School as a PhD/MD student in the interdisciplinary Health Sciences and Technology program. From 1999 to 2003 Burke completed his thesis research in organic synthesis as an HHMI Graduate Fellow under the direction of Stuart Schreiber in the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. Thereafter, he completed his clinical rotations as an NIH Fellow in the Medical Scientist Training Program and graduated from medical school in 2005.  Career  In 2005, Burke began his independent career as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where his research focuses on the synthesis and study of small-molecule natural products that perform protein- like functions.  Research  Small-molecule natural products that perform protein-like functions may ultimately serve as substitutes for missing or dysfunctional proteins that underlie human diseases, thereby operating as prostheses on the molecular scale. To enable these studies, Burke's group is exploring a synthesis strategy, dubbed iterative cross-coupling, that aims to make the process of complex small molecule synthesis as simple, efficient, and flexible as possible. This work has led to the development of more than 175 commercially available MIDA boronate building blocks that are now enabling the more effective synthesis of small molecules in many different academic and industrial institutions throughout the world. Burke's group is using this chemistry to systematically dissect the structure/function relationships that underlie the protein-like activities of a variety of prototypical small molecules, including the ion channel-forming polyene macrolide amphotericin B and the self-preserving antilipoperoxidant carotenoid peridinin. Burke's group carried out tests in animals that concluded a small molecule iron transporter, hinokitiol, could restore gut iron absorption in mice and rats and restore hemoglobinization in zebrafish deficient in Ferroportin, DMT1, and Mitoferrin respectively. This study represents the first example of the molecular prosthetics approach working in a whole animal model. Burke and his research group have developed a machine for on-demand automated synthesis of small molecules to harness the function of natural products and their derivatives.

Based in San Diego, California, Lozeau is part of a modern art movement that depicts skeleton characters as if they were alive. His paintings also pay tribute to cars, motorcycles, and guitars which have led to collaborations with Harley-Davidson and Fender Guitar Company. Lozeau's representations of vintage cars and motorcycles align with the Kustom Kulture movement which celebrates mid-century American design. His work has been featured in Disney Parks' Wonderground Gallery, and he has twice been a Disney Parks artist-in-residence. He is a guild member of the Spanish Village Art Center in San Diego. Early life David Lozeau was born in Merrimack, New Hampshire and began drawing at a very early age. Inspired by childhood heroes Bob Ross and Mark Kistler, he watched The Joy of Painting, The Secret City Adventures, and Mark Kistler's Imagination Station television series to learn the fundamentals of creating shadows, shapes, and perspective. In high school, he took as many art classes as he could and won awards for his pen and ink designs. In 1993, Lozeau enrolled in Keene State College, but was disappointed by the rigidity of the curriculum and sole focus on academia in the classroom. He worked for the college newspaper, The Equinox. He graduated in 1997 with a B.A. in graphic design and a minor in art, having only taken one painting class during the entire four-year span. Lozeau was employed as a graphic artist for seven years after graduating from college, during which time he focused solely on his design and marketing skills as a means to further his corporate career. Career In 2004, Lozeau relocated to the west coast of the United States. There, he witnessed a pinstriping demonstration at a hot rod event in Anaheim, California. He believed that the lettering enamel used in pinstriping and sign painting, with its quick dry time and high gloss finish, would be the right medium by which to fine-tune his line work and further develop his character-driven style. He began painting professionally with acrylics, gouache, and oil-based enamel. In 2008 and 2009, Lozeau's art was featured in several Kustom Kulture magazines, including Tiki Magazine, Pinstriping and Kustom Graphics, as well as Jesse James' now defunct Garage Magazine. For several years, Lozeau executed paintings on site at a variety of events such as art fairs and festivals. His technique was to paint a new piece with enamel atop acrylics. To offset the bold, shiny appearance of the enamels and get better performance than was offered by acrylics, Lozeau turned to gouache to complete his underpaintings, due to its fast dry time, opacity, and malleability. Switching to gouache allowed him to expand his color palette and enabled him to control the levels of transparency in his paintings. After experimenting with these various mediums for several years, Lozeau eventually developed a mixed media process of layering acrylics, gouache, and oil-based enamel in order to create pieces with tight line work. In 2010, Lozeau began building his own custom wood frames and adorning them with rusty metal, worn leather, and/or hand-woven accents in order to complete his vision for each unique painting. In the same year, Lozeau was the featured artist for the Dia de los Muertos celebration at California's Mission San Luis Rey de Francia district. For that event, he painted a unique piece that was reproduced on the event's T-shirts and posters. His art was also featured in two hardcover books, The Day of the Dead: El Dia De Los Muertos and Kustom Graphics 2: Hot Rods, Burlesque, and Rock 'n' Roll published by Korero Press. Another of his paintings was published in the October edition of Ol' Skool Rodz magazine. In 2011, Lozeau was featured in a number of international publications, including Spain's El Diablo magazine and Germany's Customized Magazin. In 2012, Lozeau co-wrote and illustrated the book Amigos de los Muertos and was featured in a number of magazines, including Car Kulture DeLuxe and Lowrider Arte, as well as online zine Cherry Picked Design. In 2013, Lozeau was the Artist in Residence at the Disneyland WonderGround Gallery, where his art was featured. He wrote and illustrated the first in a series of children's books about two winged skeletons and their pet dog, titled Lil' Devils Yearn to Fly. In 2014, Lozeau was once again the Artist in Residence at the Disneyland WonderGround Gallery, and was featured in Kustom Magazine and Lowrider magazine, and published his second children's book, Lil' Devils Want to Rock. In 2015, the Fender Guitar Company released four special edition guitars which feature illustrations by Lozeau. The \\"Sacred Heart,\\" \\"Tree of Life,\\" \\"Rose Tattoo,\\" and \\"Dragon\\" guitars were timed for release prior to the NAMM show. The guitar series was inspired by Lozeau's original guitar art. The new guitars are available as of March 24, 2015. Books * Devils Want to Rock. Lozeau, David. (2014) Calavera Company. * Devils Yearn to Fly. Lozeau, David.

Morphology and anatomy of conidia-producing structures, Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 1: 35‚Äì40 that are prominent on the upper parts of branches, appearing larger than other species in the genus; however, comparative measurements were not provided for all species. The cortex is glossy and moderately thick, 75‚Äì125 ¬µm thick. The relatively greater mass of the thallus may be due to a thicker glossy layer that is generally absent in many related species (‚Äúepicortex‚ÄùBowler, P.A. 1981. Cortical diversity in the Ramalinaceae. Can. J. Bot. 59: 437‚Äì453.). Similar species are Niebla juncosa, which differs in having a more fragile thallus with branches that break off as evident from the thallus falling apart in the herbarium, including breaking apart at the base, and by its less glossy cortex and less conspicuous pyncidia (due to their smaller size), and Niebla eburnea, also with smaller pycnidia (200‚Äì350 ¬µm long), but generally recognized by its pastry-like, or ivory-like, cortex. Taxonomic History Niebla infundibula was first recognized by Richard Spjut, accompanied by Richard Marin and Thomas McCloud, 19 May 1986, just south of Punta Negra on rock outcrops along a ridge that appeared to receive more precipitation from ocean fog than nearby ridges and peaks (Plate 1D in Spjut‚Äôs 1996 revision of Niebla and Vermilacinia). This area was observed during May 1985 by Spjut‚Äîwhile he and Marin were collecting samples of lichens in search of new drugs to treat HIV‚Äîto have fog lingering over the peaks and ridges most of the day. The following year, in May 1986, they were able to find a path to the foggy ridges and peaks. In addition to Niebla infundibula, other rare species of lichens were discovered, Niebla homaleoides (acid deficient) and Vermilacinia rigida. Niebla infundibula was subsequently found on another ridge just south of Punta Negra, above Punta Rocosa, in March 1988. A strong similarity of N. infundibula to other Niebla species growing with it, such as Niebla josecuervoi (salazinic acid) and Niebla homaleoides, has been suggested to be due to hybridization.Niebla homaleoides, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 26 Dec 2014; http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_homaleoides.htm The prominence of the pycnidia and their potential role in sexual reproduction has been considered.Robinson, H.1975.

However, the species (N. infundibula) appears to be relatively rare based on the relatively few collections reported. Niebla infundibula has been included under a very broad species concept of Niebla homalea;Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004.

In addition Dumbarton played in the Dumbartonshire Cup, the Glasgow Charity Cup and the Greenock and District Charity Cup. Story of the Season Dumbarton entered season 1891-92 as the defending league champions, with an almost unchanged side. The battle between professionalism and amateurism in football still raged, but for now playing for the love of the game still won in Scotland. August The season opened on 8 August with a trip to the borders, where a friendly 3-3 draw was played against 5th KRV. A further pre-season friendly was played 4 days later at Airdrie ‚Äì a 2-0 reverse being suffered. The league campaign opened on 15 August, with an away fixture against Cambuslang. The team turned out as follows: McLeod (goal); Watson and McMillan (full backs); Lang, Boyle and keir (half backs); Taylor, Bell.W, Miller.j, Thomson and Bell.J (forwards). Taylor was the first to score for the Sons after 20 minutes and Thomson followed before the interval. The second half was evenly contested and the game finished 2-0. A week later, the unfurling of the (joint) league champions flag was celebrated at Boghead where Abercorn were the visitors on league duty. The places of Watson, Lang and W.Bell were taken by A.Miller, John Gillan and McNaught respectively. Bell netted his first goal of the season in five minutes and three more followed by half time ‚Äì with Abercorn missing a penalty. In the second half it was more of the same with the final score being 8-1. On 29 August the two unbeaten sides in the league so far met, as Hearts took on Dumbarton at Tynecastle. A full strength side took to the field as Watson and Galbraith returned to the side. The Sons got off to a good start and an early ‚Äògoal‚Äô was ruled out for offside. Hearts then came more into the game and scored first, though Dumbarton equalised from an own goal before half time. Early in the second half the visitors ‚Äòscored‚Äô again but the referee did not see the ball cross the line. Luck wasn't with the Sons and Hearts took advantage with a quick brace, the second being a Miller own goal ‚Äì leaving the final score at 3-1. The result left Hearts on top of the table, with Dumbarton and Celtic leading the chase 2 points behind. September On 5 September, Dumbarton travelled to Ibrox to play last season's joint champions Rangers in a league fixture. Only one change was made with Thomson coming back in place of Galbraith. The Sons were ahead within 10 minutes from a Taylor goal, and just a minute later the same player made it two, with the hat trick being completed after 15 minutes. Rangers were a disappointing lot and it wasn't till late on that they scored a consolation goal leaving the result at 3-1. A week later Leith Athletic were visitors to Boghead in their league encounter. Miller failed to appear and was replaced by McDonald with Galbraith coming in for McMillan. Taylor continued his recent goal scoring form by having the Sons two. The other Dumbarton forwards decided to join in the second half with Miller(2); McNaught and Bell completing a 6-0 thrashing. Hearts, the early league pace setters, played their return league fixture against Dumbarton at Boghead on 19 September. Miller and Thomson returned to the side. The Sons were quickest off the mark and McNaught had the home side ahead within nine minutes. Miller and Bell made it three before 15 minutes had passed. Bell then scored again before Hearts got one back ‚Äì 4-1 after 20 minutes. Understandably the pace of the game dropped and there were no more goals before the interval. Watson had been injured in the first half and had retired for a time, and although he returned in the second half he was clearly unfit. Nevertheless, it was not until two minutes from the final whistle that Miller scored the last goal of the game for a 5-1 thumping. On 26 September Dumbarton were at Celtic Park to play off a league fixture. Watson had not recovered from his injury and was replaced by McDonald. Both teams played a fast and exciting game and despite chances falling to both the interval was reached goalless. It only took five minutes however for Celtic to take the lead in the second half and while the Sons had numerous attempts at equalising, they came to nothing and in the end the Celts scored a second just on full-time being called. So the end of September still saw Hearts in the lead with 13 points, 3 points ahead of the chasing pack of Celtic, Dumbarton and Leith Athletic. October At the beginning of the season a Canadian international touring side played a series of matches in the UK. One of these was against a Scotland XI on 3 October at Ibrox Park. John McLeod and John Bell played in the 5-1 win for the Scots, with Bell scoring two of the goals. On the same day Dumbarton visited county neighbours, Vale of Leven, on league business. In addition to the missing personnel from the representative match Taylor's place was taken by a trialist. A goal from Miller after 40 minutes was all that separated the teams at half time. A penalty brought Vale level but an own goal shortly before the end provided the Sons with a 2-1 win. A free week was followed on 17 October with a home league fixture against Third Lanark. McLeod returned to the team but Watson and Bell were absent. Nevertheless, the weakened team played well and goals in each half by Miller were enough for a 2-0 victory. St Mirren were the next visitors to Boghead on 24 October where an unchanged side was fielded by Dumbarton. Taylor and Miller (his fourth goal in three games) had the Sons two ahead by the interval. In the second half Taylor scored again before the saints got one back. A converted penalty kick by McMillan made it four before a late St Mirren flurry saw the final score being 4-2. On the last day of the month the Sons travelled to Edinburgh to play the return league fixture against Leith Athletic. Bell returned but Taylor and Miller were missing from the team. Bell wasted no time in adding to his goal tally by scoring Dumbarton's first in 10 minutes. This was the position until Leith evened up matters midway through the second half but a McMillan strike and an own goal made the points safe for the Sons in a 3-1 win. At the end of the month, with another 4 victories secured, Dumbarton were still in second place with 18 points from 11 games ‚Äì a point behind Hearts but crucially 2 games in hand. November The month began with a visit to county neighbours Renton for a league fixture on 7 November. Taylor returned but Galbriaith dropped out. Thomson and McMillan had the Sons two ahead after 35 minutes but Renton got one back before half time. An equaliser was scored midway through the second half but Taylor notched the winner for Dumbarton and another tow points added to the total. On 14 November Clyde were visitors to Boghead. Miller returned at centre forward in an otherwise unchanged side. In what became a fairly one-sided match both Bell and Taylor scored hat tricks in an 8-2 thrashing. The match against St Mirren on 21 November was postponed as Dumbarton were unable to raise a team due to illness and 2nd XI commitments. A week later there was a rest from league duty and with the first Scottish Cup encounter. Much on the prompting of Dumbarton officials, a qualifying process had been introduced to the cup competition, and Dumbarton's first appearance was at the fifth round stage. Glasgow Thistle were the opponents at Boghead. McLeod and Richmond were unavailable their places taken by Barr and Smith from the Seconds. Thistle held their own until half time but then goals from Taylor, Bell(2) and Miller carried the Sons through to the next round. At the end of November the positions in the league saw Hearts lead with 21 points from 14 matches, Dumbarton a point behind but with just 12 games and Celtic in third with 16 points from just 9 games. December December began with a league visit to Cathkin Park to play Third Lanark with Dumbarton fielding an unchanged side. Thirds started brightly and were two ahead early on ‚Äì and had another disallowed for offside. However two goals from Bell brought the teams level before the break. Early in the second half a Thirds man had to retire injured and the Sons took full advantage of the extra man, with Bell completing his hat trick then McNaught and Thomson completing a 5-2 victory. On 12 December, the league fixture against local rivals Vale of Leven was played at Boghead. Watson was a welcome returnee to the team while McDonald took the place of Keir. Conditions were miserable but Dumbarton played much the better. Taylor scored within seconds of the game starting, then Miller, Thomson and McDonald had the home team four ahead by half time. Another four goals had Dumbarton 8-0 in front with 20 minutes of the second half played and with the weather worsening the Vale captain intimated to the referee that the Vale team surrendered the game to the homesters. A week later it was back to Cathkin Park ‚Äì but this time on Scottish Cup duty. McLeod and Keir returned to the squad. As in the previous game between the sides Thirds were first to show and were a goal ahead after 20 minutes but McNaught got the Sons back on level terms just on half time. Luck once again deserted Thirds as one of their players retired injured and Taylor scored twice to take full advantage of the extra man. Late in the game Bell had to leave the field after being charged by a Thirds man. The 26 December saw near neighbours Renton come to Boghead on league duty. Keir was missing from the previous week's team. The game began in atrocious conditions but McNaught had the Sons ahead within 10 minutes. Renton got the equaliser from a scrimmage but before half time Bell made the score 2-1 before half time. Despite efforts from both teams there were no further goals. The league positions at the end of the year looked good for Dumbarton ‚Äì now ahead with 28 points ‚Äì five ahead of Hearts ‚Äì but Celtic still posed a real danger, 10 points behind but with 6 games in hand. January The New Year began with a visit to Celtic Park in a friendly. Lang replaced Keir in the team with Richmond coming back in place of Smith. A close contest was expected but from the minute that Taylor had the Sons ahead early on it was one-way traffic. Bell, Taylor again and Thomson(2) made it 5-0 by half time. In the second half it was more of the same with Bell getting his second, then McNaught and finally Taylor completing his hat trick for an 8-0 walloping. A day later, Dumbarton met hearts in a friendly at Tynecastle. The only change to the team was the resting of Taylor. In a complete reversal of roles it was the Edinburgh side who dominated proceedings taking a 5-0 lead by the interval. Thomson saved the Sons blushes with a consolation goal in the second half but Hearts increased their tally by two for a 7-1 trouncing. Then on 4 January, Dumbarton made the trip up north to face Aberdeen. McLeod and Miller were rested but despite the missing first XI men Dumbarton came away with a fine 6-1 win. Bad weather ensured that little football would be played for most of the month, until 23 January when old rivals Queen's Park came to Boghead for a seventh round Scottish Cup tie. Dumbarton were back to full strength with the return of McLeod. Keir, Taylor and both Millers. Queens opened the scoring after 15 minutes and were two up just before half time. On crossing over the Sons pressed and were rewarded by goals from Boyle then Taylor to claim a 2-2 draw A week later at Hampden, in front of 15,000 spectators, the replay took place. Dick Hunter of St Mirren took Watson's place at full back. Both sides had chances in the first half but neither team could find the net. However within five minutes of the restart Queens were ahead and three more followed before Taylor scored a consolation goal 13 minutes from time. February Bad winter weather put paid to any play by Dumbarton during February. So the positions in the league at the end of the month were unchanged, other than Celtic closing the gap in third ‚Äì now 6 points behind with 4 games in hand. March A series of international trial matches were held on 5 March to consider selection of teams to represent Scotland in the upcoming Home International Championship - John McLeod, Tom McMillan, Dickie Boyle, John Taylor, John Bell and Willie Thomson all took part. On 12 March Dumbarton played their first match in six weeks with a semi final tie in the county cup at home against Methlan Park. A number of second XI players were given starts but the long lay-off did not seem to have done the Sons forwards much harm as they raced to a 4-0 lead by half time. In the second half McLeod, who was taking a rare opportunity to show his outfield skills, joined in the scoring melee with a brace and in the end the game ended in a 9-0 rout. A week later Dumbarton returned to league duty with a visit to Paisley to play St Mirren. Watson and Taylor were missing, their places taken by Smith and McIndewar. Bell had the Sons two ahead but the Saints got one back before the break. An own goal restored the visitors two goal advantage before the Buddies got another, but it was not enough as Dumbarton ran out 3-2 winners. On 26 March John Taylor and William Thomson both earned their first caps for Scotland against Wales, with Thomson scoring a goal in the 6-1 win. At the same time Dumbarton entertained Cambuslang in the league at Boghead. In addition to the internationals, the Sons were also minus McMillan who had decided to retire from the game, and Keir. Bell and Miller put the Sons ahead early but Cambuslang came back to equalise before half time. McLeod, making up for the missing forwards, put Dumbarton ahead again. Another from McLeod and one from Miller made the final score 5-2. So having chalked up a further 2 league victories, at the end of March Dumbarton led the table with 32 points with 4 games left to play ‚Äì still 5 ahead of Hearts in second ‚Äì but more threateningly Celtic in third 9 points behind and with 5 games in hand. April On 2 April John Bell earned his second cap against England, and John McLeod earned his fourth cap in the same game, with Bell scoring Scotland's goal in the 4-1 defeat. A week later Rangers came to Boghead on league business. Unfortunately the referee from Dundee failed to appear and both teams agreed to a Dumbarton official taking his place. Goals from Boyle(2), Taylor and Bell gave the Sons a 4-1 victory, but immediately after the game Rangers protested the result. Rangers reason for the protest was that ‚ÄòDumbarton had taken then down too far, and that it would be an extremely nice thing if they could get another chance to show their paces‚Äô. The protest was subsequently upheld even though it was the Rangers secretary who had suggested that the Dumbarton referee officiate, however the League censured Rangers for ‚Äòunsportsmanlike behaviour‚Äô. On 11 April teams representing the Scottish and English Leagues met at Bolton. John McLeod, Jack Bell, Dickie Boyle and John Taylor all played in the 2-2 draw, in which Bell scored one of the goals. The following weekend Dumbarton met Vale of Leven in the Dumbartonshire Cup final at Boghead. A full strength team turned out. Miller had Dumbarton ahead midway through the first half and another goal gained through a scrimmage made the half time score 2-0. There were no further goals and Dumbarton retained the trophy for the fourth successive year. In a huge game which would go a long way to deciding the destination of the league title, Celtic visited Dumbarton on 23 April. McDonald was the only change to the side replacing Stewart. A fast and furious game saw no goals by half time but just as it looked as if the game would end in a scoreless draw Miller stepped up to grab the all important goal to provide Dumbarton with a 1-0 win. Having taken the massive step of beating their closest challengers, on 30 April Dumbarton travelled to meet Clyde in Glasgow with an unchanged side. In less than a minute Bell had the Sons ahead but it was not to be the easy victory that might have been predicted as Clyde came back with their best performance of the season to record a 4-1 result. So April ended with Dumbarton still ahead with 34 points, with 2 games left to play. Hearts had the same number of points but only had one remaining game, whilst Celtic were on 28 points with 4 games left. May On 4 May the re-run of the protested match against Rangers was played at Boghead. An unchanged side apart from Galbraith taking Taylor's place, turned out determined to show that the first game's result had been no fluke. A Bell hat-trick contributed towards a 6-0 thrashing ‚Äì not counting another two ‚Äògoals‚Äô that were disallowed. This victory ensured a 100% home league record. Three days later, Dumbarton went into their final league game knowing that a draw at Abercorn would be sufficient to win the title outright. Taylor was back in his place for the match and while the Abbies led at halftime a Thomson goal made the score 1-1 and this is how it finished. Dumbarton champions again! On 14 May Dumbarton fielded their second XI to begin their defence of the Greenock Charity Cup against Dykebar at Cappielow. The Sons had the greater share of the play and ran out 1-0 winners. The following weekend Dumbarton turned out at Ibrox to play Celtic in the semi final of the Glasgow Charity Cup. Dick Hunter of St Mirren guested for the Sons. With a strong wind in their favour Dumbarton bossed the first half although it was not until late in the first half that Miller scored the opener. In the second half however the Celts took full advantage of the elements‚Äì and would gain some revenge for losing the league title by recording a 3-1 win. The final game of the season took place on 28 May, with the final of the Greenock Charity Cup against Morton at Cappielow. Again a ‚Äòscratch‚Äô side was played with only McLeod and Galbraith of the full team present and a strong Morton side recorded a 4-1 victory. It was however not the final game for one of the Dumbarton players as on 30 May, a Scottish League XI played a Scottish Alliance XI, with John Miller being selected to play in the 'League' team, scoring twice in the 4-3 win. On the same day Dumbarton Rangers won the county Second XI cup with a 6-3 win over Smithston Hibs. With this win the ‚Äòreserves‚Äô matched the ‚Äòbig‚Äô team by winning a fourth successive county championship.

He also held the title of Imperial Preceptor ( Dishi) from 1304 to his demise in 1305. Rise of the Sharpa family The Kh√∂n family, hereditary abbot-rulers of Sakya, acquired a leading position in Tibet after the Mongol conquest of Tibet. Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa (d. 1280) held a high position at the court of the Khagan and exerted influence over Tibetan affairs. Under the abbot were the so-called Three Schools: the eastern (Shar), western (Nub), and middle (Gun). The Shar school was associated with a family of Zhangzhung origins, of the Old Tantra school (Ngag Nyingmawa). One of their line, Chukpo Jetsun Kyab, had three sons, all disciples of Phagpa. They were Yeshe Rinchen, Kunga Senge, and Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen.Shoju Inaba, 'The linaege of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, p. 111. After the young Sakya Dishi Dharmapala Raksita vacated his position in 1286 and died in 1287, Khagan Kublai Khan suspended the influence of the Kh√∂n family. Instead the Shar or Sharpa family came to the fore. This was possibly due to their good relations with the influential Yuan minister Sangge. Yeshe Rinchen was appointed Dishi by orders of Kublai Khan, while his youngest brother Jamyang Rinchen Gyeltsen became the acting abbot () of the Sakya school.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period in Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 29. The appointments gave the Sharpa brothers influence in Tibet, but neither of them was the executive ruler of the land. This task was performed by a series of administrators (dpon-chen or p√∂nchen) who resided in Sakya. In the time of Jamyang Rinchen Gyeltsen they were: * Zhonnu Wangchuk (c. 1285-1288) * Changchub Dorje (c. 1289) * Aglen Dorje Pal (c. 1290-1298) * Zhonnu Wangchuk (1298, second time) * Lekpa Pal (1298-c. 1305) Anti-Mongol rebellion The accession of Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen coincided with increasing unrest in Central Tibet. The center of anti-Yuan resistance was the important Drigung Monastery, which headed a full-scale rebellion in 1287. At first the impoverished Mongol garrisons in Tibet were unable to quell the resistance. After three years, the new dpon-chen Aglen received a fresh detachment of Mongol troops under the prince Tem√ºr Buqa, accompanied by the militia of the 13 myriarchies (divisions) of Central Tibet. The Drigung troops received assistance from the Chaghatai Mongols but suffered a defeat at Palmothang, after which the monastery was assaulted and torched. Most of the defenders inside were cut down including the administrator of Drigung. The abbot, however, managed to escape. Surviving Chaghatai troops succumbed in a snowstorm which was supposedly produced by the powerful magic skills of the cleric Zur Shakya Sengge.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan painted scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. I, p. 16. After this bloody victory the Yuan troops marched through the south-eastern part of Tibet, towards Assam, confirming Mongol and Sakya rule in these quarters.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 29-31. Yuan-Sakya rule unchallenged The crushing of the rebellion in 1290 meant that the system of Yuan overlordship assisted by Sakya was secured for the next four decades. Nevertheless, the position of the Sharpa family was probably weakened by the downfall and execution of their powerful ally Sangge in 1291. The elder Sharpa brother Yeshe Rinchen resigned as Dishi in the same year, dying three years later. After the death of Kublai Khan in 1294 the dpon-chen Aglen suggested that a scion of the old Kh√∂n family should be allowed to rule Sakya instead of Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen. This would be Zangpo Pal, a nephew of Phagpa, who presently stayed in South China. As a matter of fact the new great khan Tem√ºr acknowledged Zangpo Pal as the right heir and let him return to Sakya in 1298. Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen nominally handed over the abbot-ship, but continued to direct Sakya affairs from the official abbot's palace Zhitog. It was only in 1303 that he was summoned to Beijing by the great khan. Being a loyal and experienced man, he was ordered to take up the position of Dishi after the death of the former title-holder. Arriving to the imperial court he was officially installed on 23 February 1304. However, he already died on 5 February 1305.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 73-6.

Background Living on a family farm in rural Fruitland, Washington, in the late 1970s, the brothers' father, Don Emerson Sr., encouraged his teenage sons' musical interest as they began writing and playing their own music. Don Sr. built his sons a state-of-the-art $100,000 recording studio and in it they self-produced and self-released their first album \\"Dreamin' Wild\\" in 1979, an eclectic mix of rock, soul, R&B;, country and funk music, on their own Enterprise & Co. label. After Dreamin' Wild, Donnie embarked on a solo career and recorded at least two first solo albums; Can I See You, recorded in Los Angeles in 1981, was not released. Whatever It Takes, a country album, was released by a private press label in 1997. Dreamin' Wild had no commercial success until 2008 when record collector Jack Fleischer discovered the record in an antique shop in Spokane, Washington. Fleisher began to evangelize it. In July 2012 Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti covered the song \\"Baby\\" and in the same year Light in the Attic Records re-released \\"Dreamin' Wild\\" with \\"Baby\\" becoming an underground hit. In October 2012, the brothers performed at a Light in the Attic anniversary concert in Seattle.

In 1858, Engledue delivered a well-received series of twelve lectures on \\"Human Physiology\\" on behalf of the three Literary societies of Portsmouth ‚Äì the Athen√¶um, the Philosophical Society, and the Watt Institute ‚Äî to an enthusiastic audience of more than a thousand on consecutive Monday evenings from 11 January 1858 The Hampshire Advertiser, No.1794, (Saturday, 16 January 1858), p.8. to 28 March 1858:The Hampshire Advertiser, No.1805, (Saturday, 3 April 1858), p.8. :\\"‚Ä¶at the request of the three literary Institutions of Portsmouth, [Engledue agreed] to give a course of twelve lectures on Human Physiology ‚Ä¶ in which he finely expressed the great object of the medical profession, to teach men how to avoid disease, rather than merely to cure it when contracted. The lectures were published in extenso in a Portsmouth paper, and afford evidences of a most comprehensive mind. Elegant and chastened as literary productions, they afford a copiousness of illustration, and a simplicity of explanation, rarely attained by a scientific lecturer\\".Anon (1859), p.89. The series was immediately followed by a single lecture on \\"Cerebral Physiology\\" (N.B., rather than \\"Phrenology\\") on 14 April 1858.Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle and General Advertiser for Hants, Sussex, Surrey, Dorset and Wilts, No.3053 (Saturday, 10 April 1858), p.5. The Zoist Engledue and John Elliotson were the co-editors of The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology & Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare, an influential British journal, devoted to the promotion of the theories and practices (and the collection and dissemination of reports of the applications) of mesmerism and phrenology, and the enterprise of \\"connecting and harmonizing practical science with little understood laws governing the mental structure of man\\",Godwin (1994), p.213. that was published quarterly, without a break, for fifteen years: from March 1843 until January 1856. The Zoist, was printed on high quality paper, and issued quarterly to its subscribers. It was also published for a wider readership in annual volumes. Well-written in crisp, scientific English, it was devoted to the propagation of information about the applications of phrenology (rather than its theories) and to the collection, storage, and dissemination of reports of the therapeutic efficacy of mesmerism (with even less treatment of mesmeric theories than of phrenological theories) ‚Äî in part, it acted as a disciplinary clearing house for information and the experiences of both amateur and professional practitioners (and their subjects) from all over Great Britain, and its colonies ‚Äî and it placed great stress on the well-demonstrated usefulness of mesmerism, not only in the alleviation of disease and suffering, but in the provision of pain-free surgery, especially amputations.Gauld (1992), pp.205-208; Winter (1998), pp.154-155. Suicide Enledue \\"was a man of considerable eminence in the medical profession ‚Ä¶ and enjoyed a very extensive practice\\" in Portsmouth. In a state of deep melancholy consequent upon a nosocomial infection, namely erysipelas, acquired whilst hospitalized for surgery on an otherwise unremarkable small tumour, he took his own life in December 1858.Anon (BMJ, 1859). During the coronial inquest into Engledue's death, conducted on Friday 31 December 1858,See: Anon (Hampshire Telegraph, etc., 1859). his personal physician of eight years standing, Robert Pennington Sparrow, MRCS (England), MRCP (Edinburgh), an ex-Naval surgeon, stated that Engledue's nosocomial infection was \\"erysipelas, followed by abscess\\"; and that its pain and discomfort were so severe that Engledue \\"had occasion to take large doses of opium to produce sleep\\" constantly during April, May and June. By July, he had ceased to need opium and, despite the fact that \\"he had not thoroughly recovered, and had not the physical strength to encounter what he was called upon to go through\\", Engledue resumed his medical practice at the beginning of July. He continued to practice up to and until 20 December, when he requested colleagues to take over his work-load. At that time, given his diarrhoea and nausea, Sparrow had \\"persuaded him to lay up, telling him that he was killing himself with work\\", and, as Sparrow remarked to the coroner, whilst \\"persons labouring under the symptoms such as I have described the deceased to have suffered, are sometimes the victims of an uncontrollable suicidal impulse\\", he had formed the opinion that \\"the deceased's mental faculties were very much impaired\\", that \\"his mind was giving way, and that he was in a very different condition from what he had been in all his life before\\", and \\"was fearful of permanent insanity, rather than of any act of [suicide]\\". He also remarked that he had, therefore, come to the conclusion, that Engledue \\"was not in that condition which would induce me to recommend that his mother and sister keep a strict watch over him\\". Sparrow made a point of emphasizing that there was nothing extraordinary about Engledue possessing prussic acid, because \\"bi- carbonate of potash (i.e., potassium bicarbonate) in combination with prussic acid (i.e., hydrogen cyanide) is frequently prescribed as a medicinal agent ‚Ä¶ in case[s] of nausea in the disease under which the deceased was labouring ‚Ä¶ and medical men frequently have recourse to it\\"; and, whilst stressing that he had not prescribed this mixture in Engledue's case, he also remarked that there would have been nothing remarkable about Engledue self-prescribing its administration. Engledue's local dispensing chemist gave evidence that he had supplied Engledue's written request for \\"specific quantities of solution of taraxacum (i.e., dandelion), tincture of gentium, bicarbonate of potash, together with three drachmes of prussic acid\\" three days earlier. The jury delivered the following verdict: \\"That the deceased died from the effects of prussic acid, taken with intent to destroy life, while in a state of unsound mind.\\" Footnotes References * Anon, \\"Report of the Proceedings of the Phrenological Association at its Fifth Annual Session, at London, in June 1842\\", The Phrenological Journal and Magazine of Moral Science, Vol.15, No.73, (1842), pp.289-343.

Overview The power station has a capacity of 10 megawatts, sold directly to the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited for integration in the national electricity grid. The electricity is evacuated via a substation near the power station. The energy generated will power approximately 40,000 homes, located near the power station, thus minimizing transmission losses. Developers The power station was developed by a special purpose vehicle company, \\"Tororo Solar North Limited', specifically set up to develop, build and operate this solar power station. Tororo Solar is majority owned by Building Energy SpA, an International developer of renewable power sources, with headquarters in Milan, Italy. Other owners in the consortium include the Ugandan \\"Simba Group\\". The Simba Group also owns Electromaxx Limited, the owner-operator of the 70 megawatt Tororo Thermal Power Station, commissioned in 2010. The power generated at this power station is expected to serve an estimated 170,600 people. Construction timeline, costs and funding The cost of construction was budgeted at US$19.6 million, of which the owners contributed US$4.9 million. The remaining US$14.7 million was borrowed from Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO). Fifty percent of the FMO loan was syndicated from the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF), which is substantially funded by the governments of the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland and by the German development finance institution, KFW and its Dutch equivalent, FMO.

Whitefield Memorial Church The first chapel on the site was built in 1756 for the Evangelical preacher, George Whitefield. It was enlarged in 1759. John Wesley preached a sermon \\"On the death of the Rev Mr George Whitefield\\" both here and at Whitefield's Tabernacle, Moorfields, in 1770. The original chapel stood on the west side of Tottenham Court Road, between Tottenham Street and Howland Street, surrounded by fields and gardens. Its foundation stone was laid by Whitefield in June 1756, and it opened for its dedication service on 7 November of the same year. Its initial popularity led to plans being drawn up for enlargement, and these were quickly put into effect in 1759. Beneath the chapel, a vault was also prepared; it was Whitefield's hope that he could be interred here along with the two Wesleys, but he died and was buried in Newburyport, Massachusetts. In 1890 the building was taken down and re-erected as Whitefield's Central Mission. In 1895 the coffins buried in the crypt (including Elizabeth Whitefield, but excluding the lead coffin of Augustus Toplady) were moved to Chingford Mount Cemetery in north London.'Tottenham Court Road (west side)', Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road & neighbourhood (1949), pp. 66-74.

American Church Members of the U.S. military worshipped at Grosvenor Chapel during the Second World War. After the war, the congregation grew from the ranks of State Department and Defense Department families while still relying on military chaplains for leadership (the American Embassy was located on Grosvenor Square at this time). In 1969, the church launched independent of that support and called the Rev. William Schotanus to be its first minister.

Initially an informal gathering of the senior ministers presided over by the Sultan in person, in the mid-15th century the Council's composition and function became firmly regulated. The Grand vizier, who became the Sultan's deputy as the head of government, assumed the role of chairing the Council, which comprised also the other viziers, charged with military and political affairs, the two kadi'askers or military judges, the defterdars in charge of finances, the ni≈üancƒ± in charge of the palace scribal service, and later the Kapudan Pasha, the head of the Ottoman Navy, and occasionally the beylerbey of Rumelia and the Agha of the Janissaries. The Council met in a dedicated building in the Second Courtyard of the Topkapi Palace, initially daily, then for four days a week by the 16th century. Its remit encompassed all matters of governance of the Empire, although the exact proceedings are no longer known. It was assisted by an extensive secretarial bureaucracy under the reis √ºl- k√ºttab for the drafting of appropriate documents and the keeping of records. The Imperial Council remained the main executive organ of the Ottoman state until the mid-17th century, after which it lost most of its power to the office of the Grand Vizier. With the Tanzimat reforms of the early 19th century, it was eventually succeeded by a Western-style cabinet government.  History and function  Interior of the Imperial Council Interior of the Imperial Council Originally, the Imperial Council was probably an informal advisory body of senior statesmen, but also functioned as a court of law. In the 14th century and until the mid-15th century, it seems to have been headed by the Sultan in person, \\"suggesting that relations between sultan and viziers were still informal, with the sultan‚Äôs advisors in the role of allies as much as subordinates\\" according to the Ottomanist Colin Imber. Meetings were often public or semi-public affairs in which the Sultan would appear surrounded by his senior advisors and hear grievances of his subjects, dispense justice and make appointments to public office. In the case of an interregnum between the death of a Sultan and the arrival of his successor from the provinces, the Council was held by the senior councillors on their own. Later Ottoman tradition held that it was Muhammad II () who abandoned the practice of presiding over the council in person, instead relegating this responsibility to the Grand Vizier, ipso facto defining the latter as a distinct office from the other viziers. Muhammad II's law-code states that the Sultan would observe Council sessions behind a screen, a practice which lasted until the reign of S√ºleyman the Magnificent (), who ceased to attend Council meetings altogether. Nevertheless Muhammad II's successor, Bayezid II () is still recorded as openly chairing sessions of the Council in person, although by this time, these occasions were involved in elaborate ceremonial, in stark contrast to the informality of such audiences before Muhammad II. The gate of the Imperial Council chamber at the Topkapi Palace, Istanbul After Edirne became the Ottoman capital in the late 14th century, the Council met at the palace there or anywhere the Sultan currently resided. Following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Council met initially at the Old Palace (Eski Saray), moving to the Topkapi Palace after its construction in the 1470s. There the Council had a dedicated building (divanhane) in the Second Courtyard. The present building was built in the early reign of S√ºleyman the Magnificent by Grand Vizier Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha, and renovated in 1792 and 1819. The council chamber proper was known as kubbealtƒ± (\\"under the dome\\"). During campaigns, the Council met at the Grand Vizier's tent, which was always pitched near the Sultan's own. The law-code of Muhammad II stipulates that the Council had to meet daily, of which four times in the Council Chamber (Arz Odasƒ±) in the Topkapi Palace, where they were received by the chief usher (√ßavu≈ü ba≈üƒ±) and the intendant of the doorkeepers (kapƒ±cƒ±lar kethudasƒ±). By the 16th century, however, the full Council met regularly on four days of the week, on Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays, and sessions lasted from seven to eight hours, beginning at dawn and ending at mid-day in summer and mid- afternoon in winter. The members ate three times during each council session, breakfasting after their arrival, then after the main discussion had been concluded and finally after hearing petitions. In earlier times, the Sultan often dined with the viziers after the Council, but Muhammad II ended this practice. In addition, there were extraordinary sessions of the Council: the ulufe divani or galebe divani, convened each quarter to distribute the quarterly salary (ulue) to the members of the kapƒ±kulu (\\"slaves of the Porte\\") corps, including the Janissaries, as well as for the formal reception of foreign ambassadors, and the ayak divani or \\"foot council\\", as everyone remained standing, an emergency session chaired by the Sultan or the army commander when on campaign. Although many decisions were taken outside the formal context of the Imperial Council, it was the main executive body of the Empire, conducting all kinds of tasks of government such as the conduct of foreign relations, including the reception of foreign ambassadors, the preparation of campaigns, the construction of fortifications and public buildings, the reception of reports from the provincial governors and the appointments to state office, as well as continuing to function as a court of law, particularly for members of the military class. The inner workings of the Council are obscure, since no minutes were kept during the sessions, but the wording of Council decrees indicates that most decisions were prompted by petitions addressing a specific problem. Later foreign observers reporting on Ottoman affairs also stressed that the council was \\"purely consultative, the final responsibility resting with the Grand Vizier\\" (Bernard Lewis). The grille-covered window from which the Sultan could observe Council meetings It is impossible to determine what role the Sultan played in the Council's workings. On the one hand, all decisions were made in his name and on his authority, and Ottoman law codes foresaw that the Sultan could make his wishes known to the Council through the Kapi Agha. In Ottoman legal theory, however, as codified in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Grand Vizier was the Sultan's \\"absolute deputy\\" and the sole intermediary between the sovereign and the administration. Therefore after each meeting, the Grand Vizier‚Äîaccording to some 16th-century accounts, however, this was done by the entire Council‚Äîwould go to report on proceedings to the Sultan in the Inner Palace. These interviews between the Grand Vizier and the Sultan were probably the main conduit of communication between the ruler and his government. At the same time, the Sultan could, if he wished, secretly listen in on the Council in session behind a grille-covered window (kasr-ƒ± adil) overlooking the Council chamber and connected directly with the Sultan's private quarters in the harem, added either in the early reign of S√ºleyman the Magnificent or, according to another tradition, already by Muhammad II. It is clear, however, that each Sultan favoured a different style of government, and their roles changed even within the same reign: thus Ahmed I () is recorded as refusing an audience with his Grand Vizier, demanding written reports instead, while Murad III () at first once more presided over Council meetings in person, but increasingly withdrew from active participation as his reign proceeded. By the mid-17th century, on the other hand, the former elaborate protocol at Council sessions had once more been relaxed, and it is reported by the Ottoman renegade Bobovi that the Sultan (possibly Murad IV, ) once more presided over Council meetings in person. In addition, the courtiers and servants of the Inner Palace, or the members of the Imperial Harem such as the Valide Sultan (Sultana mother) or the Haseki Sultan (Sultana consort), who had direct and intimate access to the Sultan's person, often influenced government decisions bypassing the Imperial Council and the Grand Vizier altogether. Over time, as the importance of the Grand Vizier within the Ottoman system rose at the expense of the palace, it became common to hold an afternoon meeting (ikindi divani) to wrap up leftover issues, after the afternoon prayer (ikindi), at the Grand Vizier's residence. Eventually, the ikindi divani came to meet five times a week and took over a large part of the Council's actual business. The Grand Vizier's pre-eminence was formalized in 1654, when a dedicated building (bab-i ali, the \\"Sublime Porte\\", or pasha kapƒ±sƒ±) was constructed to serve the Grand Vizier both as a residence and as an office. The bureaucracy serving the Imperial Council was gradually transferred to this new location, and by the 18th century, the Imperial Council itself had, according to Bernard Lewis, \\"dwindled into insignificance\\". The reformist sultans of the late 18th/early 19th century replaced the Imperial Council by a new institution, as well as forming special councils to apply their reforms. This system gradually evolved into a Western-style cabinet government.  Membership  The kadi'askers The principal members of the Council had become fixed by the time of Muhammad II at least. They comprised: * the viziers, responsible for political and military affairs, and also liable to be sent on campaign, either under the Sultan or the Grand Vizier, or as commanders themselves. Their number was originally three, but this was raised to four in the mid-16th century, five in 1566, and seven in 1570/1. Their number reached as many as eleven in 1642, but by this time the title of vizier was also held by senior provincial governors (beylerbeys), who did not attend the council. The viziers with the right to attend the Council were designated \\"viziers of the dome\\" (kubbe vezirleri) from the dome surmounting the council chamber in the divanhane. * the military judges (kadi'askers), responsible for legal matters. Probably founded under Murad I, there was only one holder of the post until the late reign of Muhammad II, when a second was instituted, leading to a division of responsibility between them: one was responsible for Rumelia (the European provinces) and one for Anatolia (the Asian provinces). For brief periods, the existence of a third kadi'asker is attested as well. * the treasurers (defterdars), originally a single office-holder, increased to two (likewise one for Rumelia and one for Anatolia) by 1526, and four from 1578 (Rumelia, Anatolia, Istanbul and the \\"Danube\\", i.e. the northern coasts of the Black Sea). Further defterdars served in the provinces. With the decline of state finances from the late 16th century on, their importance increased greatly. * the chancellor (ni≈üancƒ±), possibly one of the most ancient offices, was originally the person who drew the Sultan's seal on documents to make them official. He became the head of an ever-expanding the government secretariat, overseeing the production of official documents. A defterdar The members of the Imperial Council represented the pinnacles of their respective specialized careers: the viziers the military-political; the kadi'askers the legal; the defterdars the financial service; and the ni≈üancƒ± the palace scribal service. This was all the more the case after the 16th century, when these careers became‚Äîas a general rule‚Äîmutually exclusive. While the latter groups were from the outset recruited mostly from the Muslim Turkish population (although the kadi'askers tended to come from a very limited circle of legal families), the viziers were, after 1453, mostly drawn from Christian converts. These were partly voluntary (including, until the early 16th century, members of Byzantine and other Balkan aristocratic families) but over time the products of the devshirme system, which inducted humble-born youths into the Palace School, came to predominate. An appointment to the ranks of the Imperial Council was an avenue to great power, influence and enormous wealth, which was matched by equally ostentatious expenditure for, as Colin Imber writes, \\"the sign of a man's status in Ottoman society was the size of his household and the size of his retinue when he appeared in public\\", meaning that the members of the Council often kept hundreds, if not thousands, of slaves. Over time, the Council's membership was extended to include additional officials: * the beylerbey of the Rumelia Eyalet, who was the only provincial governor entitled to a seat in the Council, but only when a matter fell within his jurisdiction. * after the post's creation in 1535, the Kapudan Pasha, the commander-in-chief of the Ottoman navy, was also admitted as a member. * the Agha of the Janissaries was admitted to the Council if he held the rank of vizier. In addition, a number of officials attended Council meetings but did not have seats in the chamber and did not take part in the discussions, such as the head of the scribes (reis √ºl-k√ºttab), the √ßavu≈ü ba≈üƒ±, the kapƒ±cƒ±lar kethudasƒ±, various financial secretaries and palace officials, interpreters (terc√ºman, whence \\"dragoman\\") and police chiefs, each in turn with his own retinue of clerks and assistants. Council bureaucracy The reis √ºl-k√ºttab An ever- expanding scribal service, under the supervision of the reis √ºl-k√ºttab, assisted the members of the Council, preparing the material for its sessions, keeping records of its decisions and creating the necessary documents. As their duties included drafting the state correspondence with other powers, initially they were probably drawn from various milieus, since until the early 16th century the Sultans corresponded with foreign rulers in their own language. After documents were only drawn up in Turkish, Arabic or Persian, and the service seems to have consisted solely of Muslims. The main branches of this secretarial service were: * the main chancery (divan kalemi or beylik/beylik√ßi kalemi) under the beylik√ßi, the senior subordinate of the reis √ºl-k√ºttab. This was the office responsible for drafting and publishing all imperial decrees (firman) or ordinances on all issues except for financial ones, and for keeping an archive of the originals of all laws and regulations (kanun) as well as treaties or other documents concerning relations with other states. * the tahvil kalemi, also ni≈üan or kese kalemi, which issued the documents of appointment for the posts of vizier, beylerbey, sanjakbey and provincial kadi, and kept the relevant records. In addition, it dealt with the grant and transfer of timars and ziamets. * the ruus kalemi, which was responsible for the appointments of all other civil, military or religious officials beyond those dealt with by the tahvil kalemi. * the offices of the master of ceremonies (tesrifat√ßƒ±) and official court chronicler (vakan√ºvis) who kept records on ceremonies and history. * a later addition, the amedi or amedci, the chief of staff to the reis √ºl-k√ºttab, headed a department responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs, as well as for the liaison between the various government departments and the palace.

Distinguishing Features Niebla isidiosa is characterized by a rigid thallus divided into irregularly widened branches, to 5 cm long and 5 cm across, by its development of dense isidia along the reticulate ridges of the cortex, by containing divaricatic acid, and by the absence of pycnidia. The irregular widened branches are similar to Niebla caespitosa, which not only lacks isidia, but also has a thinner cortex, 45‚Äì75 Œºm thick, in contrast to 100‚Äì150 Œºm thick in N. isidiosa. The thicker cortex of N. isidiosa‚Äîalong with its reticulate ridging‚Äîis much like that of Niebla testudinaria, 100‚Äì150 Œºm thick; it also lacks isidia. Another similar species, Niebla sorediata, which has a relatively thin cortex, 30‚Äì40 Œºm thick, differs by the granular appearance of the isidia that become sorediate (soredium).

The Galician independence movement or the Galician separatist movement (Galician: independentismo galego) is a political movement, derived from Galician nationalism, which supports the independence of Galicia and Galicia estremeira (As Portelas, O Bierzo e Terra Eo-Navia) or the unification with Portugal. History Initiation The first realization was the organized political committee Comit√© Revoluzonareo Arredista Galego, formed by Fuco Gomez in Cuba in the 1920s, but during the Second Spanish Republic did not have much significance. In Argentina there was an association called Sociedade Nazonalista Pondal, active mostly in the 1930s. Republic of Galicia In 1931, Galicia declared its independence. The next day, Galicia rejoined Spain. Franco and the 70s Estreleira is the flag used since the 70s by the galician separatism and the galician nationalism. In the 1970s, a sector of the Galician People's Union near of Moncho Reboiras tried to organize a rebel group against Franco following the model of ETA, but ended with the death of Moncho Reboiras. In 1978, a sector of the Galician People's Union was split, constituting first the Galician People's Union-Proletarian Line and later the Galician Party of the Proletariat, with secessionist character. Galician independentism at present In 1986 the Communist Party of National Liberation, a secessionist splinter of the Galician People's Union, was expelled from the BNG for having supported the candidacy of Herri Batasuna during the Elections to the European Parliament. Beside the Galiza Ceive-OLN (the new name of the organization) and several secessionist groups, they formed the Galician People's Front the following year, which has been the main Galician secessionist organization since then. In that context appeared the Ex√©rcito Guerrilheiro do Povo Galego Ceive, which carried out 90 terrorist actions in six years, the last one on 13 of September, 1991. As consequence two activists, a civil guard and a girl died. Several dozens of supposed members were arrested. Ten members of Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista and other groups were held in 2005 and two of them were strongly suspected of having placed a bomb in an automatic cash dispenser in Santiago de Compostela. That same year the existence of a group named Resist√™ncia Galega, which has claimed responsibility for several bomb attacks, was made public.

After competing in minor hurdle events for the first two years of his racing career, he demonstrated dramatic improvement when switched to steeplechasing, winning nine consecutive races including the Peterborough Chase, Victor Chandler Chase and Comet Chase. He returned after a long injury lay-off to produce his best form as a ten-year-old in the spring of 1997, defeating strong fields in both the Queen Mother Champion Chase and the Melling Chase. His veteran trainer Tim Forster regarded him as the best horse he had ever trained. Martha's Son was retired from racing after failing to recover from serious muscular injuries in a race in November 1997. He died in May 1999. Background Martha's Son was a bay gelding with a small white star bred in the United Kingdom by Michael Ward-Thomas. He was sired by Idiot's Delight a successful National Hunt stallion whose other progeny included Cavvie's Clown (three-time winner of the Jim Ford Chase and runner up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup), Clever Folly (winner of twenty eight races including the December Gold Cup) and Ida's Delight (Castleford Chase). Martha's Son's dam, Lady Martha was a descendant of Loch Cash, the dam of the King George VI Chase winner Lochroe. During his racing career, Martha's Son was owned by Ward-Thomas in partnership with Paddy Hartigan, a civil engineer and antique dealer. The gelding was sent into training with Captain Tim Forster (trainer of three Grand National winners) at Letcombe Bassett in Oxfordshire. Forster moved his string of horses, including Martha's Son, to his new base at Downton Hall near Ludlow, in Shropshire in the summer of 1994. Forster was well known for his pessimism; before the 1980 Grand National his instructions to the rider of Ben Nevis, the eventual winner, were \\"keep remounting\\". Racing career 1991/1992 season: Novice Hurdles Martha's Son began his racing career in a novice hurdle at Stratford Racecourse on 28 December 1991. After the race, Forster in a typically downbeat assessment told Ward-Thomas \\"I will never, as long as I train, win a steeplechase with this horse. He will never jump fences\\". Starting a 25/1 outsider he recovered from interference to take the lead at the second last hurdle and won by five lengths from the Jenny Pitman-trained Lusty Light. On his next appearance in January, the gelding started favourite but fell at the second last when disputing the lead with the eventual winner Knight In Side. At Fakenham Racecourse a month later he was again favoured in the betting but was beaten ten lengths into second by Steveadon. On 7 March Martha's Son was matched against more experienced opponents when he contested a handicap hurdle for amateur riders at Sandown Park Racecourse. Ridden by Captain C Ward-Thomas he carried 146 pounds and finished ninth of the ten runners. 1992/1993 season: Hurdle races Martha's Son began his second season on 12 October with a win in a handicap hurdle at Fontwell Racecourse, beating Tel E Thon by five lengths under a weight of 144 pounds. After finishing third in a similar event at Huntingdon Racecourse twelve days later he won again at Wincanton Racecourse in November, carrying 150 pounds and beating seven opponents at odds of 13/2. He continued to rise in the handicap weights and carried 153 pounds when winning a more valuable race at Newbury Racecourse in January. Carl Llewellyn who had ridden the horse in his last four races, was replaced by Brendan Powell when Martha's Son contested the Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse later that month. The gelding began to struggle after the fifth hurdle and was pulled up before the last. He did not race again that season. 1993/1994 season: Novice Chases Martha's Son began his next season in handicap hurdles, finishing fourth at Newbury in October and second at Sandown in October. In the latter race he was ridden by Rodney Farrant, who became his regular jockey. He was then switched to larger obstacles and began to compete in novice chases. He made a successful chasing debut at Nottingham Racecourse on 3 December, taking the lead after the last and winning by three and a half lengths from the favourite Rodeo Star. When matched against more experienced opposition in a handicap chase at Huntingdon in January and won again, beating Spree Cross by two and a half lengths. Returning to novice company at the same track in March, he remained unbeaten over fences beating three opponents at odds of 4/6. Almost all of the geldings races up to this point had been over two miles, but for his final appearance of the season he was moved up to two and a half miles for a novice chase at Sandown on 29 March. Starting at odds of 8/15, he took the lead at the second last fence and accelerated clear in the closing stages to win by fourteen lengths from Yorkshire Gale. 1994/1995 season: Steeplechases On his first appearance of the 1994/1995 season Martha's Son faced the Rowland Meyrick Chase winner General Pershing and the Northumberland Gold Cup winner Clay County in a two- mile handicap chase at Haydock Park Racecourse on 2 November. He took the lead approaching the last fence and went clear on the run-in to win by eight lengths from Clay County, taking his winning run to five. Three weeks later Martha's Son was moved up in class to contest the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon in which he was matched against the 1993 Champion Chaser Deep Sensation. Martha's Son led from the ninth fence until the final obstacle when he made a bad jumping error and was overtaken by Deep Sensation, but rallied on the run-in to regain the advantage and won by one and a quarter lengths. Moved up to two miles five furlongs on Boxing Day, Martha's Son won his seventh consecutive race when he won the Mid Season Chase at Wincanton. Martha's Son's first race of 1995 saw him carrying 149 pounds and starting at odds of 3/1 for the Grade 2 Victor Chandler Handicap Chase over two miles at Ascot Racecourse on 14 January. He was opposed by Viking Flagship, Storm Alert (twice winner of the United House Construction Chase), Deep Sensation, Uncle Ernie (Aintree Chase) and Coulton (Mersey Novices' Hurdle). Farrant restrained the gelding in the early stages before moving up to take the lead from Coulton at the second last and stayed on strongly on the run-in to win by two and a half lengths from Egypt Mill Prince. On 8 February Martha's Son attempted to extend his winning run to nine when he started favourite for the Grade 1 Comet Chase over two and a half miles at Ascot. His opponents again included Coulton and Deep Sensation as well as the Tripleprint Gold Cup winner Amtrak Express. He overtook Coulton at the third last and went clear to win \\"very easily\\" by seven lengths despite being eased down by Farrant in the closing stages. On his final appearance of the season Martha's Son contested the Melling Chase at Aintree Racecourse and started 11/10 favourite ahead of Viking Flagship, who had won his second Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival three weeks earlier. After taking the lead after the second last he was overtaken on the run-in and sustained his first defeat in seventeen months as he finished third, beaten a short head and a length by Viking Flagship and Deep Sensation. 1995/1996 season: Steeplechases Martha's Son made only one appearance in the 1995/1996 season. At Huntingdon in November he started 10/11 favourite for the Peterborough Chase but was beaten a neck by the Nicky Henderson-trained Travado, to whom he was conceding four pounds. The veteran Docklands Express, winner of the Whitbread Gold Cup, Martell Cup and two editions of the Racing Post Chase was more than thirty lengths back in third. Martha's Son was being prepared for a run in the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day when he sustained an injury which ended his season. 1996/1997 season: Steeplechases After being off the racecourse for fifteen months, Martha's Son returned in the two-mile Emblem Chase at Kempton Park on 22 February 1997. Ridden by Norman Williamson, he had little opportunity to show his wellbeing as he fell at the second fence of a race won by Viking Flagship. In order to prepare the horse for his next run he was taken to Bangor-on-Dee Racecourse for a schooling session but his participation in the Champion Chase at Cheltenham was in doubt until the last moment owing to the firm ground. On 12 March 1997, Martha's Son made his first and only appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he was one of six horses to contest the thirty-ninth running of the Champion Chase. The six-year-old Strong Promise headed the betting after beating One Man at level weights in the Comet Chase. The joint-second favourites were Viking Flagship (winner in 1994 and 1995) and the Irish challenger Klairon Davis (winner in 1996). Ask Tom, the winner of the Maghull Novices' Chase and the 1997 Victor Chandler Chase came next in the betting market ahead of Martha's Son, who started at 9/1. Farrant held up Martha's Son at the rear of the field before making progress approaching the third last where the leader Strong Promise made a bad mistake allowing Ask Tom to take the lead. Martha's Son made further progress on the outside and jumped the second last in a close fourth behind Ask Tom, Viking Flagship and the weakening Strong Promise before moving into third on the final turn. Approaching the final fence, Martha's Son moved up between Viking Flagship on the inside and Ask Tom and the outer and then jumped into the lead at the obstacle. He steadily increased his advantage on the run-in and won by two and a half lengths from Ask Tom, with Viking Flagship half a length away in third. The winning owners, Ward-Thomas and Hartigan were both seriously ill at the time and entered the winners circle on crutches. Ward-Thomas said \\"We had to run, as none of us may be around next year\\". Paddy Hartigan died less than four months later. Forster later admitted to the Racing Post's that he never expected the gelding to complete the race, saying \\"I was sure he'd clip the top of one and turn over\\". On 4 April at Aintree, Martha's son faced a rematch with Ask Tom, Viking Flagship and Strong Promise in the Melling Chase over two and a half miles. Strong Promise was again made favourite on 9/4, with Martha's Son second choice on 5/2 ahead of Viking Flagship (11/4) and Ask Tom (4/1). As at Cheltenham, Carl Llewellyn restrained the horse at the back of the field and was still last of the four runners jumping the third last as Ask Tom and Strong Promise contested the lead. As Ask Tom weakened, Farrant moved Martha's Son forward on the inside and overtook Strong Promise approaching the final fence before drawing away on the run-in to win by five lengths. After the race Forster said \\"He's got two speeds. One is totally switched off and relaxed. The other is when you press the button and he fires away\\". Forster's assistant Henry Daly later recalled \\"Norman Williamson was on Strong Promise and he couldn't believe his eyes at the speed with which Martha's Son jumped past his horse. Martha's Son destroyed them.\\" Final race, retirement and death Martha's Son returned in the Peterborough Chase on 25 November 1997. He started joint-favourite with One Man but was pulled up and immediately dismounted by Farrant after jumping four fences. He was found to have sustained a serious muscle injury which \\"tore a large muscle away from the back of an elbow\\" In December 1998, it was announced that the horse had failed to recover from the injury he had sustained in the Peterborough Chase and was retired from racing. He was sent to spend his retirement at Newmarket where he acted as a hack for the trainer Michael Bell. His physical condition, however, continued to deteriorate and he was euthanised in May 1999 and buried at Downton Hall. Henry Daly, who took over the training license when Forster retired owing to poor health, explained \\"although the injury healed well, the legacy of previous problems with the same leg resulted in a chronic carpal canal condition affecting the tendons and the knee. Despite careful nursing and management, he became unable to strengthen his forelimb and to lock his knee, so he could neither be ridden nor turned out without significant lameness. Rather than keep him permanently confined, he was quietly put to sleep last week.\\" Tim Forster, who died in April 1999, called Martha's Son \\"the best I've ever had. He was a child's pony at home and a tiger on the racecourse ‚Äì all he wanted to do was please\\". Rodney Farrant, who retired from riding on 2000 at the age of twenty-seven said of Martha's Son that \\"when he was right, nothing could beat that horse\\".

Mirza Mohammad Taqi (c. 1579 - 11 October, 1645) (), better known as Saru Taqi (, meaning \\"Taqi the blond\\") was a eunuch of Safavid Empire, who served as the Grand Vizier of the Safavid king (shah) Safi (r. 1629‚Äì1642) and the latter's son Abbas II (r. 1642‚Äì1666) until he was assassinated on 11 October 1645.  Biography  Origins and early life Saru Taqi was born in ca. 1579 in Tabriz to a poor middle-class Muslim family, which became disgraced after the death of his uncle Khwaja Qasim Ali. Saru Taqi served in the army during his youth in Isfahan, and was later appointed as the financial minister of the governor of Ardabil, Zu'l Fiqar Qaramanlu. Saru Taqi later served in the same office in Ganja and Shirvan, but was some time later appointed as the Grand of the governor of Karabakh. In 1615, Saru Taqi was castrated by the Safavid shah Abbas I after having been accused by a furrier named Mu'min of having forcibly had sex with him. His property was then taken, but it was later restored after Abbas I found out that the accusation was false. One year later, Saru Taqi was appointed as the governor of Mazandaran, and one year after that, was appointed as the governor of Gilan. During his governorship of those two provinces, he laid foundation to many buildings and towns, such as Farahabad and Ashraf. In 1629, Abbas I died and was succeeded by his grandson Safi, whom Saru Taqi enjoyed good relations with. During the same year, Saru Taqi, along with other governors, suppressed the rebellion of Gharib Shah, which took place in Gilan and Mazandaran. In 1631, Saru Taqi was sent to Baghdad to take part in the renovation of the Shia shrines. Two years later, Saru Taqi dishonored the Safavid Grand Vizier Mirza Talib Khan and secretly had him assassinated. The reason behind these actions was due to a personal hatred Saru Taqi had towards the family of Mirza Talib Khan, whose father Hatem Beg Ordubadi had denied to give Saru Taqi's father a post which he had asked for. Furthermore, Saru Taqi also took over the house of Mirza Talib Khan, which was in Isfahan, the capital of the Safavid Empire.  Vizierate under Safi (1633-1642)  Safi then appointed Saru Taqi as his new Grand Vizier. During the same year, Saru Taqi made a conspiracy against the powerful military officer Imam-Quli Khan, which resulted in the latter's death and his possessions being converted into the crown estate. In 1634, Saru Taqi appointed his brother Mohammad Saleh Beg as the governor of Mazandaran, thus reducing the power of the descendants of the Marashis, who were the elite of the province. In 1638, Saru Taqi, who aimed to having Ali Mardan Khan, the governor of Qandahar, dismissed, demanded a large sum of money from him. After having been under pressure by Saru Taqi for some time, Ali Mardan Khan defected to the Mughal Empire of India, and then fled into India. On 12 May 1642, Safi died.  Vizierate under Abbas II and death (1642-1645)  On 15 May 1642, at Kashan, Mohammad Mirza was crowned as the shah of Iran and chose \\"Abbas II\\" as his dynastic name. Since he was less than 10 years old when he became shah, the job of governing Iran was placed in the hands of his mother, Anna Khanum, and Saru Taqi, while Abbas concentrated on his education at Qazvin. Saru Taqi and Anna Khanum worked closely together, and under them Iran was in secure hands. The French traveller Jean Chardin said the following thing about them: In 1643, Saru Taqi accused the powerful military commander (sipah-salar) Rustam Khan of treason, and had him executed. During the same year, the daughter of Saru Taqi's court ally Jani Khan, was given in marriage to his nephew. One year later, Saru Taqi enlarged the Ali Qapu Palace. On 11 October 1645, Saru Taqi was betrayed and murdered in his own house by Jani Khan, mostly likely with the approval of Abbas II, who was trying to get independence from his mother and the slaves which supported her. When Anna Khanum heard about the murder of Saru Taqi, she became extremely angry, and sent one of her eunuchs to Jani Khan in order to find out the reason behind the murder. Jani Khan then insulted both Anna Khanum and Saru Taqi, which four days later resulted in his death by an assassin sent by Anna Khanum. The successor of Saru Taqi was a Marashi descendant named Khalifeh Soltan, who had already served as Grand Vizier from 1623 to 1631.  Legacy  Saru Taqi took part in the construction of many buildings, and is one of the most important builders of the Safavid era. One of these buildings was the one of the most important Shia places, the Imam Ali Mosque, which Saru Taqi rebuilt. Furthermore, he also spent his own revenue to construct commercial and religious buildings, a mosque and a bazaar in Isfahan being of the examples.

It is a virtuosic piece for both instruments. Weber most likely composed the work for himself (on piano) and his friend Heinrich Baermann, a leading clarinettist of the era, although it has also been suggested that the intended clarinettist was Johann Simon Hermstedt. The three movements are as follows: #Allegro con fuoco #Andante con moto #Rondo: allegro The second and third movements were completed before the first and were probably performed in 1815 for King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria at the Nymphenburg Palace. During its composition, Weber designated the work as a sonata, but abandoned that title upon its completion. This decision reflected the work's character as more of a showcase for two virtuosos than a conventionally structured and integrated work. The first movement is in sonata form, the second movement is an Andante in C minor, and the finale is a lilting rondo in E-flat major. The British music critic John Warrack suggests the work could be referred to as a \\"double concerto without orchestra\\", reflecting the highly virtuosic roles for both performers.

Distinguishing Features Niebla josecuervoi is distinguished by the thallus divided into linear-prismaticLinear‚Äîhaving parallel sides for 10 times or more the width. Prismatic‚Äîshaped like a prism in cross section branches initially developing from a common attachment base (or holdfast); the outer basal branches generally creeping or ascending near the ground for some distance, central branches ascending to erect, all dividing irregularly and frequently above, bearing many short spine-like branchlets along the upper side, collectively appearing comb-like; the whole thallus to 22 cm in diameter. The species (N. josecuervoi) also recognized by containing salazinic acid, without triterpenes. Similar species are Niebla arenaria that differs by the absence of a holdfast and by terminal short bifurcate, or antler-like, branchlets, Niebla effusa that has terminal flattened, hooked, and fringed branches, Niebla flabellata that differs by the irregular-shaped branches mostly flattened above a short tubular base, Niebla marinii distinguished by the wide angled branching (horseshoe-shaped), Niebla limicola distinguished by shortly bifurcate branchlets along lower dilated branches, Niebla pulchribarbara distinguished by containing protocetraric acid instead of salazinic acid, and the acid-deficient Niebla homaleoides. Taxonomic History Niebla josecuervoi was first recognized by Phillip Rundel and Peter Bowler based on thalli ‚Äúgrowing abundantly on basalt ridge of Colina del Sudoeste, Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n, 28 March 1971‚Äù as a new species of Desmazieria (type specimen, salazinic acid, Rundel & Bowler 250, Univ. Calif. Irvine, Fig. 3), the genus name later replaced by Niebla.Rundel, P. and P. Bowler. 1978. Niebla, a new generic name for the lichen genus Desmazieria (Ramalinaceae). Mycotaxon 6: 497‚Äì499 It was one of two new species they described for the genus, the other, Niebla pulchribarbara (as Desmazieria), was distinguished by the absence of a ‚Äúbasal attachment plate,‚Äù and also by the absence of apothecia, while further noted in the descriptions of the two species to differ in their chemotypes, salazinic acid (N. josecuervoi), protocetraric acid (N. pulchribarbara). It was also stated that N. josecuervoi is ‚Äútypically saxicolous,‚Äù whereas it was unclear whether their interpretation of the terricolous species (N. pulchribarbara) included thalli with salazainic acid since only N. josecuervoi was mentioned as growing on sand (less than 2%) in their data (‚ÄúTable 2‚Äù) on ground coverage of lichens at the type locality. Richard Spjut, who conducted almost yearly expeditions to Baja California‚Äîtwo to four weeks duration‚Äîfrom 1985 to 1996, did not find Niebla with protocetraric acid south of Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n among approximately 2,000 specimens of Niebla he analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. On 5 May 1986, Spjut, accompanied by John Cassady, Chairman of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at Purdue University, and later Dean of the School of Pharmacy at Ohio State University, along with his graduate student, Thomas McCloud, collected a 1 kg sample of a terricolous Niebla on sandy shore of Bah√≠a Falsa at Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n. Voucher material from that sample (WBA-333;WBA is an acronym for World Botanical Associates. Plant samples collected for medicinal research were given a collector‚Äôs number for the voucher specimens, and an accession number for the samples. During May 1986, Richard Spjut collected samples of lichens for a lichen flora of Baja California, for medicinal research at Purdue University, and also of vascular plants. All voucher specimens, which in some cases represented type specimens, were deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany), identified as N. pulchribarbara) was only found to have salazinic acid. All collection data were entered into database software. Plant samples at Purdue University were later transferred by Thomas McCloud to the National Cancer Institute‚Äôs Natural Products repository where included among the repository of 100,000 extracts of natural products, and which also includes all the detailed data on the field collection was later designated as type for the newly described Niebla arenaria Niebla josecuervoi as recognized by Spjut is according to the morphological and chemical description provided by Rundel and Bowler but not according their ecological data.

Niebla. ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2‚Äô: 368‚Äì380. did not provide a description for Niebla josecuervoi, but instead stated ‚Äúsee Niebla homalea for a description‚Äù with further reference to their discussion where it was concluded that only two species can be recognized‚Äîby the medulla reaction to para- phenylenediamine, depsidones (pd+), depsides (pd-).; however, the acid- deficient species recognized by Spjut (N. homaleoides) is chemically more related to the depsidone species group. Two descriptions were provided for N. homalea, one for rock forms and one for soil forms; soil forms were implicitly excluded from the nomenclature list of synonyms by stating ‚Äúrock populations of N. homalea thalli have spot tests negative, except P+ (synonym Niebla pulchribarbara; see Niebla josecuervoi), K+ when salazinic or protocetraric acids are present (See Niebla josecuervoi).‚Äù It appears that the description under N. homalea was intended for the two species, a practice that deviates from that traditionally published in floras. As was the case in the 1972 publication, the data and discussion for the soil inhabiting Nieblas in the Sonoran Desert flora are conflicting. Additionally, the distribution map shown for Niebla josecuervoi indicated only four areas of occurrences on the main peninsula of Baja California and one for Guadalupe Island; species with depsidones do not occur on Guadalupe Island. Niebla josecuervoi was recognized by Spjut as ‚Äúcommon on lowland rocky terraces and mesas, occasional on stones of mountains ridges,‚Äù in the ‚ÄúNorthern Vizca√≠no Desert‚Äù and ‚Äútransitional vegetation to California Chaparral.‚Äù References External links World Botanical Associates, Niebla josecuervoi, retrieved 26 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_josecuervoi.htm#josecuervoi *Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert: Book Review, Richard Spjut, web page, http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichen%20flora%20review.htm Category:Fungi of North America Category:Lichens Category:Ramalinaceae ","title":"Niebla josecuervoi"},{"id":"44884542","text":"Fake It may refer to: * Fake it till you make it, a concept that suggests imitating qualities can lead to a realization of those qualities in a person's life * \\"Fake It\\" (Bastille song), a 2016 song by Bastille * \\"Fake It\\" (Seether song), a 2007 song by Seether * Fake It, a song by Hyomin from her 2014 EP Make Up * \\"Fake It\\", B-side of \\"Nee\\" (Perfume song), a 2010 song by Perfume * Fake It Flowers, a 2020 album by Beabadoobee ","title":"Fake It"},{"id":"44884580","text":"The Rising Sun, Fitzrovia.

He ruled nominally from 1298, in reality from 1306 to his death in 1323. Family and upbringing Zangpo Pal belonged to the Khon family, hereditary abbot- rulers of Sakya. The family obtained a leading position in Tibet under his uncle Phagpa who, as a Buddhist intellectual, enjoyed the confidence of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty. Phagpa's brother Yeshe Jungne (1238-1274) lived in Yunnan in south-western China where he was the household lama of Kublai Khan's son H√ºgechi. He married Jomo Rinchen Kyi of the Palrin family and begot a son called Zangpo Pal.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, p. 109. The boy was brought up in Sakya but neglected his religious studies, the raison d'√™tre of the Khon family. At 21 years of age he was summoned to the imperial court in Beijing on the initiative of Kublai Khan's consort Abu.Probably meaning ƒåabui or Chabi, d. 1281, who was Kublai Khan's consort. Zangpo Pal would have been 21 in 1281 by Tibetan reckoning, thus still within the lifetime of Chabi. Later, however, he became a persona non grata as doubts were cast on his legitimacy. Zangpo Pal was banished to an island off the coast of South China. He was the only remaining member of the Khon family after the death of his cousin Dharmapala Raksita in 1287, but was passed over for the succession. Kublai Khan handed over the Sakya estates to a member of the Sharpa family, Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen, while the latter's brother Yeshe Rinchen was appointed Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) with influence over Tibetan affairs.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990. pp. 71-2. Elevation to the Sakya see After the death of Kublai Khan in 1294, a movement to bring back Zangpo Pal as the Sakya ruler emerged. The administrator (dpon-chen or ponchen) Aglen took the initiative to summon a council in Sakya on the matter. The officials agreed to send a petition to the Dishi in Beijing, Drakpa Odzer. The issue was brought before the great khan Tem√ºr who found it wisest to approve. Zangpo Pal was recalled from his island in 1296 and arrived at Sakya in 1298. To strengthen his position, Tem√ºr provided him with a Mongol princess, M√ºdegen. On the great khan's order, he also married five further wives who belonged to the highest nobility of Tibet.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 73-5. Although Zangpo Pal was given the formal reins of power, Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen retained actual power until 1303 when he was summoned to the imperial court to take up the position of Dishi. In the meanwhile Zangpo Pal continued his religious studies. He is said to have been a rustic figure with a bad temper and foul language.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 75. It was only in 1306 that he formally took over the full dignity of abbot- ruler of Sakya. In 1311 the great khan endowed him with the title Guoshi (State Preceptor), and two years later he took his vows as a fully ordained monk. By this time he had begotten a multitude of children, including 13 sons. Conditions in Tibet were generally peaceful in his days. The thirteen trikor (myriarchies) of Central Tibet were administered by a series of dpon-chen: * Sengge Pal (early 14th century) * Odzer Sengge (c. 1315-1317) * Kunga Rinchen (c. 1319) * Donyo Pal (c. 1320) * Yontsun Drakpa Dar (before 1322) * Odzer Sengge (?-1328/29, second time) Seeds of dissent The family network of Zangpo Pal, and the imperial favours he enjoyed, once again gave the Khon lineage a degree of influence over Tibet. His son Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen was appointed Dishi in 1314. The dignity of Dishi was subsequently held by a number of his descendants up to 1362. As imperial preceptors they had a say in the affairs of Tibet, since their orders were issued in the name of the supreme imperial authority.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan painted scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. I, p. 15. However, the proliferation of sons in the family made for internal rivalries in the Khon family. When the Dishi Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen returned to Sakya from Beijing in 1322, he took the initiative of dividing the siblings into four groups, each of which was given a part of Zangpo Pal's heritage. The branches (ladrang) were named from the palaces where they resided: * The branch of the Zhitog palace, official residence of the abbot- ruler up to 1959. * The branch of the Lhakhang palace. * The branch of the Rinchengang palace, north-east of Zhitog. * The branch of the Ducho palace, south-east of Zhitog.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 81. The consequences of this were serious. Each palace had an abbot (dansa) and the actual abbot-ruler (dansa chenpo) had only nominal superiority. With internal unity weakened, the Sakya elite was unable to prevent increasing unrest in the various myriarchies of Central Tibet.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 81-2. When Zangpo Pal died, probably in 1323, a new star was already rising in the political landscape of Tibet: the Phagmodrupa myriarchy which would eventually take over power from Sakya in the 1350s.Giuseppe Tucci 1949, Vol. I, pp. 17-24.

He received recognition for his grad project, the 2005 film Delivery, and for his art piece The Experience of Fliehkraft and its film offshoot The Centrifuge Brain Project, both released in 2011, and more recently for his 2015 film Dissonance. Background Till Nowak was born 28 July 1980, in Bonn, Germany, and until 2008 lived in Mainz. He was born to artistic parents; his mother taught ceramics to children and his father was a painter and teacher. At age 19 in 1999, he founded and began work in his own studio FrameboX. From 2000 to 2005, he studied media design at the University of Applied Sciences in Mainz. He has collaborated with his brother Nik Nowak, and states when the two get together the ideas flow. For his thesis project at the University of Applied Sciences, in 2005 Nowak wrote, directed, and produced Delivery, a 9-minute animated film which screened at more than 200 international film festivals, winning more than 35 awards, including those from AFI Fest Hollywood, Annecy International Animated Film Festival, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Kurzfilmpreis, and a nomination from the European Film Awards. He had first shared the film on an internet forum discussing simulated 3-D in film, the resulting attention included hundreds of emails with job offers and festival invitations. After leaving Mainz in 2008, Nowak took up residence Hamburg. He is a member of both the German Film Academy and the European Film Academy. In spring of 2013, he was signed by UTA. In April 2015, Nowak and his family moved to Los Angeles, California. Projects Till Nowak is known for his 2005 film Delivery, his 2011 art piece The Experience of Fliehkraft, and the related award-winning 2011 film The Centrifuge Brain Project. The latter two focus on a series of odd (and physically impossible) rides that he was inspired to create when visiting an amusement park in 2008. Creating the sequences for the seven rides took three months, spread out through 2008 and 2011. The Experience of Fliehkraft debuted in 2011 as part of the solo exhibition \\"A Lot of Civilisation\\" during \\"Walk of Art\\" at Prototyp Museum in Hamburg, Germany. Touring as part of the art installation \\"A Lot of Civilisation\\", the art piece visited numerous museums and international venues, including Ars Electronica in Linz and SIGGRAPH in Vancouver, British Columbia in 2011, the Transmediale in Berlin and the Seoul Biennale in South Korea and the 7th edition of Media City Seoul in 2012, and most recently at the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris as part of L' Art Robotique through January 2015. As Nowak began sharing his faux blueprints and realistic clips as part art installations, he released The Centrifuge Brain Project. Its creation was inspired by wanting \\"to create an even stronger clash between realism and absurdity.\\" Choosing a realistic approach, he used the mockumentary style to allow viewers \\"to feel as if they were eye witnesses\\", and \\"to enhance the impact of the idea.\\" As part of the film's plot, he creating a fictional research company and hired an actor to play the firm's Chief Engineer. Nowak had the monologue concept in his head for a while, but the script was written just two days before filming. Nowak stated, \\"I had no technical reference for the short film. I created the manipulated amusement rides and the techy talk just out of my own scientific humor. They are a mix of real physics, absurdity and deliberate contradictions. The goal was to create the biggest possible mistake, but still make it sound serious and convincing.\\" Filming took two days ‚Äì one day in an actual amusement park and one day in a laboratory ‚Äì and editing took two months.

Harstena () is an island located in the northern part of the Gryt archipelago in Valdemarsvik municipality, Sweden. The island is principally known for the seal hunting that was once carried out there, but also as one of the stations for the shipping forecast broadcast by Sveriges Radio. The island is a popular tourist attraction in summer, when daily boat tours depart from Fyrudden and Tyrisl√∂t. The island Hargsten√∂ was mentioned in Gustav Vasa's jordebok from 1543 but burial sites indicate that it was inhabited already in the Iron Age. The number of residents reached a maximum in the 19th century when 70‚Äì80 people made their living on the island. Taxation records from that time show that fishing and seal hunting were the main source of income. The seal catch was the main source of income until the 1940s when the price of seal fur dropped. Seals became extinct during the 1960s and 1970s but reestablished themselves during the 1990s. A seal colony numbering around 60 animals has established itself in a special protected area. The seal blubber boilers were built on the island in 1911, renovated 1999 and were declared protected 2011. They are today used as a museum The island is also known for its fresh water tarn with its red water lilies. The number of residents diminished during the 20th century and today Harstena has only a few year-round residents. The island was reachable by telephone in 1930 and electrified 1945.

Biography  Hanken studied mathematics and physics at the University of Twente and the VU University Amsterdam, and received his PhD in 1954 at the Ohio State University with the thesis, entitled \\"A method and a model for the analysis and description of car- following performance.\\" From 1955 to 1967 Hanken studied and worked in the United States. Early 1960s he worked for the Industrial Nucleonics Corporation in Ohio, where he developed and patented several measuring systems. From 1965 to 1967 he taught systems engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 1967 he moved back to the Netherlands to teach systems theory at the University of Twente and the Eindhoven University of Technology. From 1974 to 1986 he was Professor of Systems Theory at the University of Twente, specifically focussing on systems concepts and methods in the social sciences. Among his students were Ton de Leeuw, Walter Kickert and Nic Kramer. Hanken made an important contribution to the introduction and spreading of systems theory in the Netherlands. In 1970 with Gerard de Zeeuw he cofounded the Dutch Systems Group.Gerard de Zeeuw (2006), \\"A forgotten message? von Bertalanffy's puzzle\\" in: Kybernetes, Vol 35 Issue 3/4, pp. 433‚Äì440 DOI: 10.1108/03684920610653728 After his retirement in 1986 Hanken published several books on Eastern philosophy and mysticism. Hanken died at home in Amstelveen and was buried at Zorgvlied.  Work   Cybernetics and Society, 1981  In his 1981 \\"Cybernetics and Society: An Analysis of Social Systems,\\" Hanken explains, that there are different ways to analyse societies as a social systems. A common approach is to see society as a network of interacting persons or groups, called actors. In those days these actors were \\"usually represented by either stimulus response or normative models.\\"Hanken (1981, intro) The problem with these analysis-techniques of social systems was, according to Hanken, that they were not detailed enough. They didn't \\"include a number of essential psychological attributes.\\" In his work he proposed to extend the existing methods, and presented a new framework to make this possible.  Classification of social systems  Hanken (1981) argued that in the social systems can be classified in three main types:Hanken (1981, content) * Autocratic systems * Collective systems, and * Democratic systems This systems differ in ways of decision-making, social interaction, dominance relationship, principles of coordination, communication, bargaining, coalitions, etc. The social system itself can be pictured with three types of subsystems:Hanken (1981, p. 6) * The system S * The environment E, and * The decision-maker D Furthermore, these systems contain five essential variables: the control variables, the input variables, the state variables, the output variables, and the information variables.  Reception  In the sociocybernetics of the 1980s, it was an ongoing question what constitutes social systems. In his 1981 Cybernetics and Society, Hanken stated that social systems consists of actors, inline with Tom Baumgartner in his 1978 paper entitled \\"An actor-oriented systems model for the analysis of industrial democracy measures.\\" Other scientists in those days defined the components of social systems simply as individuals, or communications. In summarizing the different approaches in cybernetics on evaluation processes Levin-Rozalis (2010) stated that developments has led to \\"relativist and subjective perceptions of knowledge.\\"Levin-Rozalis, Miri. \\"Cybernetics: A possible solution for the ‚Äúknowledge gap‚Äù between ‚Äúexternal‚Äù and ‚Äúinternal‚Äù in evaluation processes.\\" Evaluation and program planning 33.4 (2010): 333‚Äì342. Is this matter Hanken (1981) had shown that \\"two actors in the same system will not absorb the same information from sources either outside or inside the system, nor will they perceive or weight it in the same way.\\"  Selected publications  * Hanken, A.

She is the oldest confirmed wild bird in the world as well as the oldest banded bird in the world. Biography Wisdom hatched in or around 1951. In 1956, at the estimated age of five, she was tagged by scientists as #Z333 at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge for study, but then returned to the wild rather than being kept in captivity. The person to attach the first tag was Chandler Robbins, who was a senior scientist at the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Birds are banded so that they can be studied, including their locations, flight patterns, longevity, and a myriad of other data that can be collected. On December 3, 2014, Wisdom made headlines when she laid an egg at the Midway Atoll. Her mate had arrived at the atoll on November 19 and Wisdom was first spotted by the refuge staff November 22. The egg was estimated to be number 36 for Wisdom over her lifetime. Albatrosses lay one egg per year and have monogamous mates for life. In nine years from 2005 to 2014, Wisdom laid an egg for eight of them. Smithsonian has speculated that since Wisdom is so unusually old for her species, she may have had to find another mate to keep breeding. The USGS have tracked Wisdom since she was tagged, and they have logged that Wisdom has flown over three million miles since 1956 (approximately 120 times the circumference of the Earth). To accommodate her increasing longevity, the USGS has replaced her tag a total of six times. Together with her chick, she survived the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami that killed an estimated 2,000 adult Laysan and Black-footed albatrosses, and a much larger number of chicks, at the refuge. Wisdom has laid some 30-40 eggs in her lifetime. In December, 2016, Wisdom (at the approximate age of 66) hatched and reared another chick. In December 2017, she was breeding again. Most albatrosses lay every other year, but Wisdom has successfully hatched a chick every year since 2006. In December 2018, USFWS Pacific Region reported that Wisdom was back on Midway Atoll and had laid an egg. In February 2019 the egg hatched. Impact The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has stated, \\"Wisdom‚Äôs continued contribution to the fragile albatross population is remarkable and important. Her health and dedication have led to the birth of other healthy offspring which will help recover albatross populations on Laysan and other islands.\\" Bruce Peterjohn, chief of the North American Bird Banding Program, stated, \\"she is now the oldest wild bird documented in the 90-year history of our USGS-FWS and Canadian bird banding program. To know that she can still successfully raise young at age 60-plus, that is beyond words.\\" Wisdom has received coverage from many major news sources in the United States and elsewhere, including The Guardian, National Geographic, Discovery News, and 60 Minutes. In January 2020 Wisdom was featured in episode 3, \\"Hawaii\\", of BBC Two's Earth's Tropical Islands.

Career Born in Christchurch, Harrison started his career as a window dresser with the D.I.C department store in his home town, while taking night classes in patternmaking. In the 1960s he worked as a clothing designer in Auckland. In 1961, aged 19, he was a finalist in the New Zealand Gown of the Year competition; in 1962 he won second place in the competition with an embroidered and beaded dress called Scheherazade. Harrison worked with Auckland fashion designer Colin Cole before opening his own boutique, Jasper Johnsons Jamboree, in Takapuna, and developed a reputation for his gowns, bespoke suits and bridal wear. In the 1970s, Harrison shifted his practice from clothing production to quiltmaking, beginning a successful career as a textile artist. His early works were quilts made from dress fabric scraps. His first quilt exhibition was shown in 1979 at the Denis Cohn Gallery in Auckland. These works \\"reflected fabric art trends of the time - traditional American quilting techniques depicted subjects including Kiwi aviation pioneer Richard Pearse\\". Harrison credited Denis Cohn for giving his artistic career a major boost. Cohn introduced Harrison to Wellington art dealer Janne Land, who showed his work regularly until his death. Throughout his textile career, Harrisons's work ranged from large-scale quilts to smaller needlepoint canvases and simple works stitched on cloth. Textile historian Ann Packer recognises Harrison as ‚Äúthe man who pioneered quilting as an art form in New Zealand...a storyteller par excellence who creates his narratives in stitch.‚Äù Major works and commissions The Family is a popular and well-known collection of 35 dolls crafted by Harrison over 30 years and exhibited widely throughout New Zealand. The Family was first exhibited at The Dowse Art Museum in 1987, and was re-exhibited several times, including in 2005 and 2014. In 1994, the Parliamentary Service Commission appointed Harrison to design and oversee the creation of two large- scale works for Parliament Buildings in Wellington. The two works, These are Matters of Pride and Whanaungatanga (Relationships), combined MƒÅori weaving traditions with European embroidery practices and drew upon the skills of four MƒÅori weavers and over 700 embroiderers. They took two years to complete. Other commissions include Oceania, located in the Bank of New Zealand tower in Queen Street in Auckland, and a work in the North Shore City Council Chambers. Recognition In 1992, Harrison represented New Zealand at the Fibre Triennial in Lodz, Poland. In 2004 Harrison was awarded the inaugural Creative New Zealand Craft/Object Art Fellowship, worth $65,000. He created a new body of work as recipient of the award, drawing inspiration from Francisco Goya's etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (c. 1799). The works were shown at an exhibition titled Minus Reason at Auckland gallery Objectspace in 2005. Legacy Since Harrison's death on Waiheke Island in 2007, a number of exhibitions have been staged surveying his work or linking his career to that of other artists. Objectspace staged a memorial exhibition, Requiem, in 2008. Malcolm Harrison: A celebration, a touring survey exhibition of Harrison's work, showed at the Waiheke Community Art Gallery in 2017. The exhibition included quilt works, tapestries, assemblages, small sculpture, works on paper, poetry, and illustrations and texts for children's books. In 2018 The Dowse Art Museum will show Sleeping Arrangements, an exhibition that brings a selection of Harrison's quilts together with works by three other artists of different generations to his own: Grant Lingard (1961‚Äì1995), Zac Langdon-Pole (b. 1988), and Micheal McCabe (b. 1994). Harrison's work is held in the collections of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and The Dowse Art Museum.

Carroll returned to Indiana and enrolled at the Indiana University for college, but left school in her senior year to pursue a career in broadcasting. She settled in New York with hopes of working on Broadway, but found little work until she auditioned for a group called the Merry Macs. With the Merry Macs, she appeared on Fred Allen's show and in the movie Love Thy Neighbor. Carroll left the group when it relocated to California; she signed on with the Satisfiers only after the group promised to remain in New York. Carroll was married to guitarist Carl Kress; the couple had a son, Rick, who became a drummer, and went on to become a professor of harmony at Berklee College of Music. Helen Carroll and the Satisfiers were regulars on Perry Como's Chesterfield Supper Club which ran from 1944 to 1949. (One of Chesterfield's long-term advertising taglines was \\"They Satisfy\\", and the Satisfiers were named on this basis.)

It includes roll-on/roll-off facilities handling motor vehicle import and export and break bulk commodities and a container terminal. The dock is named after John Percival Webb OBE, a former Melbourne Harbor Trust commissioner. History Roll-on/roll-off ship at Webb Dock Shipping in Melbourne was initially accommodated at wharves on the Yarra River downstream of Queen Street, and for ships of deeper draught, at anchorages in Port Phillip Bay. The Melbourne Harbour Trust acted on plans that had been developed in the immediate post war period, to construct a new dock at the mouth of the Yarra, which would reduce the turn-around time for shipping by avoiding the difficult route up to the river wharves.Jubilee history of the Melbourne Harbor Trust: compiled from the original records of the Trust and from the Victorian Hansard / by Benjamin Hoare, 1842-1932 The shore at the head of Port Phillip Bay once accommodated fishermen's shacks, the last of which was demolished in the 1970s to expand the dock. No.1 \\"roll‚Äêon roll‚Äêoff\\" berth was completed and opened in 1959 with a road ramp and land area for the Princess of Tasmania passenger and vehicle ferry service. The Princess of Tasmania used Webb Dock from about 1959.Collin Jones, 'Wharves and Docks', eMelbourne encyclopedia This was the first berth of its type in Australia. No. 2 berth was completed in 1961 to accommodate the roll‚Äêon roll‚Äêoff cargo vessel Bass Trader. No. 3 berth was built between 1967 and 1969, while No. 4 Berth was opened in 1975, and No. 5 in 1982. The Webb Dock railway line and a rail terminal north of the dock were constructed in 1984-86 to link the dock with the West Melbourne rail yards but decommissioned in 1992 due to its impractically sharp bends and to enable the development of Docklands. The Yarra River crossing on the rail link was reused as a pedestrian bridge as part of Docklands precinct. Operation The dock comprises 8 berths including a dedicated roll-on roll-off cargo terminal operated by Toll Shipping. It handles both container traffic and automobile imports. The Philippine company International Container Terminal Services Inc.International Container Terminal Services Inc \\"won a 40 year concession to operate the Webb Dock container terminal in May 2014, amidst opposition from unions.\\" Webb Dock East has five berths and 40 hectares of container stacking area. Berths 1 and 2 serve the Tasmanian coastal trade and three multi‚Äêpurpose general cargo berths and an automotive terminal accommodate cars, trucks, buses and other wheeled machinery, as well as bulk break commodities such as timber, wood pulp and newsprint. The ship loading installed in the 1980s were removed in mid 2014. Webb Dock West is Australia‚Äôs main terminal for motor vehicle imports and exports with over 370,000 new vehicles pass shipped in 2012‚Äê13. It comprises ‚Äúroll‚Äêon roll‚Äêoff‚Äù ramps with a 19‚Äêhectare automotive terminal with storage for 7000 vehicles.

He reigned from 1325 to 1341, but was more prominent in religious than in worldly affairs, and his time saw the beginning of the decline of the Sakya hegemony in Tibet. A divided heritage Khatsun Namkha Lekpa Gyaltsen was one of the thirteen sons of the previous abbot-ruler (dansa chenpo) of Sakya, Zangpo Pal. His mother was Macig Yon Dagmo.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 110. Shortly before the death of his father, his elder brother, the imperial preceptor Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen, made a division of his brothers into four branches who resided in four different palaces: Zhitog, Lhakhang, Rinchengang, and Ducho. Zangpo Pal died in 1323, and Khatsun, being the head of the Zhitog branch, was installed as upper ruler in 1325. The Yuan emperor Yes√ºn Tem√ºr bestowed a seal and the title guanding guoshi. Although he enjoyed considerable religious prestige, Khatsun's actual authority appears to have been quite limited. He is seldom mentioned in the chronicles. Yes√ºn Tem√ºr tried to strengthen the position of Sakya by appointing his brother Sonam Zangpo as viceroy of the three cholka (regions) of Tibet: Kham, Amdo and √ú-Tsang. This, however, did not turn out to be particularly effective. Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 82. A series of administrators (ponchen) handled the affairs of Tibet, although with varying success. During the tenure of Khatsun they were: * Odzer Sengge (d. 1328/29) * Gyalwa Zangpo (1328/29-1333) * Wangchuk Pal (1333-1337) * Sonam Pal (1337-1344) Indian invasion in the Himalayas During the tenure of Khatsun Namkha Lekpa Gyaltsen, Tibet may have been threatened by a military expedition dispatched by Muhammad ibn Tughluq, sultan of Delhi. According to the historian Firishta, \\"having heard of the great wealth of China, Muhammad Tughluq conceived the idea of subduing that empire; but in order to accomplish his design, it was necessary first to conquer the country of Himachal which lies between the borders of China and India.\\"Mahomed Kasim Ferishta, History of the rise of the Mahomedan power in India, Vol. I. New Delhi 1981, p. 239. Himachal refers to Nepal and the lands on both sides of the Himalayas. The near-contemporary historian Ziauddin Barani, on the other side, states that the sultan strove to conquer the mountain of Kara-jal between Hind and China.R.C. Majumdar et al., An advanced history of India. Madras 1985, p. 316. Despite the warnings of his councilors, Muhammad ibn Tughluq sent a sizable army up to the north in 1337. Firishta relates that the Indians, greatly diminished by hardships, met a large Chinese army at the border and had to fall back, closely followed by the Chinese. On the retreat downhill the sultan's troops suffered terribly from heavy rains and attacks by mountain tribes. Just a few soldiers returned to Delhi, only to be executed by the enraged sultan.Mohamed Kasim Ferishta 1981, p. 240. Modern historians, however, doubt that Muhammad ibn Tughluq actually entertained the fantastic plan to conquer Tibet and China, and believe that the expedition may have aimed at tribal groups in the far north, towards the border to Tibet.R.C. Majumdar et al. 1985, p. 316. Disintegration Already in 1327 a serious conflict arose between the ponchen Odzer Sengge and the Sakya see. However, representatives of the Karmapa sect managed to mediate between the parties. In 1335-36 the emperor Toghon Tem√ºr dispatched two officials to get a tighter grip on the situation in Tibet. They carried out an inspection and revision of the census and taxation, but their presence caused great discontent from the populace.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 92-7. Even more seriously, the Phagmodrupa myriarchy under its dynamic leader Changchub Gyaltsen fell out with the Yazang myriarchy over the border between the two. In order to stop the ambitious Phagmodrupa lord, the Sakya official Wangtson treacherously arrested Changchub Gyaltsen in 1336. Although the prisoner was released by the weak-willed ponchen Sonam Pal after a while, the event made for future clashes. The abbot- ruler Khatsun had little or no part in the political trouble at the time. However, the Zhitog and Rinchengang branches of Sakya had a clash in 1341, and Khatsun was forced to step down, leaving the dignity to his brother Jamyang Donyo Gyaltsen.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 99-100.

This network is like a web (see picture) forming a grid on the map. Before accurate surveying there was no method for measuring longitude at sea so maps possessed many distortions especially in the east west direction. There was also distortion due to the curvature of the Earth's surface. The multitude of compass roses with straight lines extending outwards across the map derived from how the maps were then made by compiling empirical observations from navigators who attempted to follow a constant bearing at sea. To calculate a course to follow from a ships position to a point of desired destination, one would identify the windrose thought to be closest to the ships position. Then using a parallel rule -- the \\"line of course\\" taken from the rose to the point of destination,would be transferred to the ships known position. The lines are not true rhumb lines in the modern sense, since these can only be drawn on modern map projections and not on 13th-century charts. They were close to true rhumb lines in the Mediterranean area but highly inaccurate in the Teixeira planisphere and the other planispheres drawn in any pre-Mercator projection. The grid can be easily spotted (as parchment is quite translucent) by observing the map from its rear face, with a light source illuminating the other side. The hole in the center of the circle, origin of the whole network, is also clearly visible from the rear.  Rhumblines vs. windrose lines  A part of the Catalan Atlas. All portolan maps share these characteristic \\"windrose networks\\", which emanate from compass roses located at various points on the map (or mapamundi). These better called \\"windrose lines\\" are generated \\"by observation and the compass\\", and are designated today as \\"lines of course\\" or \\"lines of rhumb\\" (\\"rhumb lines\\" in the fourteenth century, traced on portolan's particular projection, though not to be confused with modern rhumb lines, meridians or isoazimuthals). To understand that those lines should be better called \\"windrose lines\\", one has to know that portolan maps are characterized by the lack of map projection, for cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in portolans, and those straight lines they could be loxodromes only if the chart was drawn on a suitable projection. As leo Bagrow states:\\"..the word (\\"Rhumbline\\") is wrongly applied to the sea-charts of this period, since a loxodrome gives an accurate course only when the chart is drawn on a suitable projection. Cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in the early charts, for which we therefore retain the name 'portolan'.\\"  Network design  Portolan by Petrus Vescomte Pujades in his book \\"Les cartes portolanes\\" has a chapter with all known theories and, with the aim to clarify the controversial arguments, he shows an image of Petrus Vesconte drawing a portolan in one of his maps in which it is visible how he started by drawing first the rhumbline grid. Some authors call it \\"winds network\\" instead of using the term \\"rhumbline network\\" or \\"network of rhumblines\\". The circle is divided into sixteen equal parts defining a hexadecagon, then the network of sailing directions \\"for a 16 winds rose\\" is represented by groups of 16 \\"straight lines\\" called rhumblines. From each vertex, 7 rhumblines are projected towards the hexadecagon's interior connecting \\"in an alternated pace\\" to 7 of the vertex opposite to it, but without routing any line to connect that vertex to the other 8 intermixed vertex. The remaining 9 rhumblines (to complete the 16 winds) are projected from each vertex towards the exterior of the hexadecagon, although in some portolans those 9 lines do not appear. The lines of the courses for the eight main directions (or winds) are drawn with black ink (or sometimes gold); the eight intermediate directions (half-winds) are drawn in green; and in the case of a 32 winds rose, the sixteen remaining (quarter-winds) are drawn in red. The intersection of this set of \\"rhumblines\\" determine on the portolans a varied pattern of symmetrical squares, parallelograms, trapezoids and triangles.  Vellum map creation process  The process for a vellum chart creation used to be as follows: * They prepared a vellum of good size, or several of them glued together. * They drew a well-centered hexadecagon (or two linked by a vertex) with a network of 16 lines per vertex (with the different colors mentioned above: black, green and red). * They copied on top of the grid the coasts lines trying to let the 16 vertex in visible places, as shown in Vescomte's portolan picture with its rhumbline network drawing a 16 vertex regular polygon (hexadecagon) that is perfectly centered on the parchment. * In the case of the Mediterranean sometimes contained two hexadecagons and has the two opposite corners matching what is called the \\"portolan diaphragm \\" (axis of the Mediterranean .. or parallel of Rhodes). * Finally they labeled and decorated the whole vellum with more or less profusion.  Planispheres with double hexadecagon  In large planispheres, especially those containing the oceans (World Map), the cartographer used to draw two hexadecagons with the two opposite corners superimposed in the center of the vellum. There are plenty of mappae mundi that use the double- hexadecagon rhumbline networks but they can not be considered portolan charts since they do not have any ports indicated on them. In the Cresques planisphere one is able to read the names of those lines which were winds: tramontana, levante, ponente, mezzogiorno, greco, sirocco, and lebegio. When limited to small seas, planispheres approximately follow both rhumb lines and great circles. But on big oceans they do not follow either of them, due to the imprecision of the map making of that time, corresponding more or less accurately to rhumb lines only in the Mediterranean portolan charts and deviating greatly in the Texeira planisfere (among others). Double hexadecagon in Cantino's planisphere Rhumb line construction scheme with two hexadecagon in the Cantino planisphere Double hexadecagon in Texeira's planisphere Rhumb line construction scheme with two hexadecagon in the Texeira planisphere  Use of rhumblines  To calculate on a portolan chart the course to follow from a point of origin to a point of destination, one should transfer -- using a parallel rule -- the \\"line of course\\" drawn from the point of origin to the point of destination, on top of the Compass rose closest to the ship's position, obtaining on it the theoretical course to be followed when sailing towards the destination. This theoretical course may have to be modified (as many times as needed) when tacking if the wind is right ahead of you, or to correct the effects of leeway, currents, etc... that a sailor with experience should be able to calculate empirically.

These works are set in a universe where fairy tales and mythologies, both pagan and Judeo-Christian, exist with its figures existing alongside the mundanes (normal humans). A race of humans who possess angel blood, the Nephilim or Shadowhunters, is organized to patrol the Shadow World and prevent demons as well as Downworlders, including warlocks, faeries, werewolves, and vampires, from attacking the mundanes. There is an uneasy peace, a treaty known as The Accords, between the governing body of the Nephilim, known as the Clave, and the Downworlders, not all of whom want peace or respect the Clave's authority. Novels The following books are arranged in order of their respective timelines. The Infernal Devices The Infernal Devices is the second set of books to be published. Set in 1878 in Victorian era London, it revolves around Tessa Gray, a teenager who comes to London following her brother's invitation but ends up thrust into the Shadow World upon learning she is not a mundane but, rather, a warlock variant, warlocks being half-human and half-demon.

The film was originally due for release on August 23, 2013, but was pushed back two days earlier, on August 21, 2013. The film premiered on August 12, 2013, at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. Production on a film adaptation of the second book, City of Ashes, was due to start in September 2013, but was delayed to 2014, and eventually cancelled, after the first film failed to recoup its budget. Television On October 12, 2014, at Mipcom, Constantin confirmed that The Mortal Instruments will return as a television series with Ed Decter as showrunner. Constantin Film and TV head Martin Moszkowicz told The Hollywood Reporter that, \\"It actually makes sense to do [the novels] as a TV series. There was so much from the book that we had to leave out of the Mortal Instruments film. In the series we'll be able to go deeper and explore this world in greater detail and depth.\\" The producers hope to adapt the entire book series if the TV adaptation proves successful. In February 2015, book series author Cassandra Clare announced via Twitter that the television series would be called Shadowhunters rather than The Mortal Instruments. In March 2015, ABC Family picked up Shadowhunters straight-to- series, and premiered on January 12, 2016. The series was renewed for a second season in March 2016, comprising 20 episodes, which premiered on January 2, 2017. In April 2017, it was announced that the series was renewed for a third season of 20 episodes. The first half of ten episodes premiered on March 20, 2018. On June 4, 2018, Freeform canceled the series after three seasons, but ordered two extra episodes to properly conclude the series' story; the second half of the third season premiered on February 25, 2019.

It was designed by Hennessey, Hennessey, Keesing and Co and built from 1925 to 1926 by Stanley Samuel Carrick. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 July 1995.  History  Church entrance, 2015 The Corpus Christi Church was constructed in 1925-1926, for the Roman Catholic parish at Nundah, who formerly practiced in a small timber church on another site. The church was constructed under the guidance of the then Archbishop James Duhig, who promoted Catholic presence in Brisbane by exploiting prominent sites, to produce landmarks. Corpus Christi may have been designed as a scale model for the Holy Name Cathedral which was in the planning stages at this time. The architects for the project were Hennessey, Hennessey, Keesing and Co. Settlement in the Nundah area began with a Moravian mission set up for Aborigines in the area in 1838. Although the mission was closed by 1848 many of the missionaries and their families remained in the Nundah area. In the 1860s a strong German presence was felt in the area, particularly as a result of immigration. The first Lutheran and Methodist services in Queensland were held in Nundah. It was not until 1903 that the catholic community in the area, who attended church at Wooloowin, Sandgate, or inner city areas, met to discuss the construction of a church. On June 19, 1904, Archbishop Robert Dunne blessed The Church of the Real Presence, and spoke of the momentous occasion, which saw the opening of a Catholic church in what was the birthplace of Protestantism in Queensland. The church cost , which was paid off before the opening and was located on the corner of Duke Street and Buckland Road. A strong Catholic presence in Nundah by 1915, dictated the need for a school, and the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart were asked to join the parish, to open this school. Previously, property in the area had been purchased by the church as a more suitable church site, due to its position on the crest of a hill. The property previously belonged to a Mr Henry Donkin who had constructed a large house, Marsten, which was used by the sisters as the first school and convent. A presbytery was built on the grounds of Marsten, soon after 1920, when the Rev Archbishop James Duhig became the registered owner. The first parish priest was Father Jordan, who stayed with the Nundah parish until 1941. Previously, priests cycled from the Wooloowin presbytery to say mass in the small timber church. A site was chosen on the grounds near the school and presbytery for a more imposing church. Church dome, 2015 It was part of Duhig's grand plan for the development of the Catholic Church in Brisbane that a number of churches be built to manifest the strength of the church. Many of the sites Duhig sought were on hill tops. By 1940, when Duhig had been controlling the estate for twenty-eight years, forty-six new churches in Brisbane had been built since 1912, including St Joseph's at Kangaroo Point, Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola at Toowong and St Agatha's at Clayfield. Duhig favoured certain architects, particular the designers of Corpus Christi, Hennessey and Hennessey, who planned the ill- fated Holy Name Cathedral with the Archbishop. Duhig felt that the construction of churches enhanced the catholic presence and signified the strength and wealth of the church. Corpus Christi Church was planned to be a golden link in the chain of churches around Brisbane. Some sources state that it was a scale model for the Holy Name Cathedral, which was planned for a site in Ann Street, across the street from All Hallows' School. The design of both of these Hennessey and Hennessey buildings was thought to be reminiscent of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which has the characteristic dome, surmounted by a lantern and cross. The laying of the foundation stone of the Corpus Christi Church on June 14, 1925 attracted 20,000 people, who donated to the construction of the church, although the church was not fully paid off until the 1940s. The church was designed by Hennessey, Hennessey, Keesing and Co, architects in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Jack Hennessy, junior had recently completed the additions to St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, and was a friend and colleague of the archbishop at the time. The work was completed by local contractor, Stanley Samuel Carrick, for a total cost of . Corpus Christi Church was opened on 21 November 1926 in a ceremony which saw eight tiers of lights illuminating the dome. The original house, Marsten was demolished in 1959 to make way for a new convent. The church remains intact with very little alteration.  Description  Side of the building, 2015 Corpus Christi Church is a brick building situated on the crest of a hill, in Bage Street, Nundah, with expansive views to the north and east. The design of the church was influenced by the Romanesque Revival style, in its massing and detailing. Several large trees and established gardens surround the building. Corpus Christi Church is a symmetrically composed, polychrome brick building, with traditional Latin Cross plan and a polygonal chancel extending from the western end. The terracotta tiled roof, is gabled over the front and two transept entrances and hipped over the chancel. The dominant feature of the church is the copper sheeted dome, which extends about above ground level above the junction of the transepts and nave. Surmounted on the dome is an octagonal lantern, with a Celtic cross finial. The dome rests on an octagonal drum, supported square planned arcade. The drum, of polychrome brick, features tripartite arched window openings on each of the eight faces. The church features polychrome brickwork patterning, including chequer pattern banding on the gables, banding on external columns, dark brick quoining and a dark brick plinth. The external walls are buttressed with shallow attached piers. The eastern elevation features an open portal, with a vaulted covering sheltered by a gabled awning, supported on coupled columns, featuring plaster cast capitals and bases. The portal opens onto an arcaded entrance porch, defined by similar columns, from which a closed timber quarter turn stair runs to the gallery. Panelled timber doors open off the entrance bay to the church. Above the portal are three round headed arched window openings, glazed with leadlight. The entrances to the north and south transepts are similar to the main eastern entrance, but with vaulted awnings supported on moulded corbels. The western facade has a brick arcaded verandah echoing the octagonally shaped chancel. Internally the church is dominated by the coffered interior of the dome at the intersection of the nave and transepts. This is supported on four wide arches, which span the internal width of the church, one of which forms the chancel arch. The chancel features an ornate marble altar and a large Italian painting. Flanking the chancel are two side chapels with religious statues. Unusually, a marble altar rail has survived, as have two confessional bays on the north and south walls. A gallery sits over the eastern end of the interior, with a large Whitehouse Brothers pipe organ. The interior is carpeted and has rendered brick walls with a timber boarded ceiling.  Heritage listing  Corpus Christi Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 July 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Corpus Christi Church was built during a time of expansion of the Catholic Church in Queensland during Archbishop Duhig's time, when an effort was made to create a strong Catholic presence, particularly in those areas of traditional Protestant dominance. The design of Corpus Christi is significant as it paralleled the design of the ill-fated Holy Name Cathedral and may have been planned as a scale model for the cathedral. The Corpus Christi Church is a manifestation of the Catholic ethos of exploiting imposing sites to produce prominent landmarks. This is particularly true of churches built during the time of Archbishop James Duhig. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The church is a particularly good example of an inter- war church, influenced by the fashionable Romanesque revival of church architecture in Australia, with its feature dome, picturesque massing and polychrome brickwork, a style favoured by Archbishop Duhig. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is symbolically important to the catholic parish of Nundah. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The church has special associations with Archbishop James Duhig and the architects Hennessey and Hennessey.

The genus is solely known from an Eocene fossil forewing found in Europe. At the times of description the genus was composed of a single species, Elektrithone expectata. History and classification Elektrithone expectata is known only from the one fossil, the holotype, specimen number SMF Be 2374, which is housed in the collections of the Senckenberg Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum in Frankfurt, Germany. The specimen is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of 46 million year old Baltic amber which was deposited during the Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on what plant family produced the amber, with evidence supporting relatives of either an Agathis relative or a Pseudolarix relative. The fossil was first studied by the paleoentomologists Vladimir N. Makarkin of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Sonja Wedmann of the Senckenberg Forschungsstation, and Thomas Weiterschan of H√∂chst im Odenwald, Germany. Their 2014 type description of the new genus and species was published in the online journal Zootaxa. The genus name Elektrithone was coined by the researchers as a combination of the moth lacewing genus Ithone and the Greek word elektro meaning \\"amber\\", which is in reference to the finding of the genus in Baltic amber. The specific epithet expectata is from the Latin word meaning \\"expected\\", alluding to the anticipated find of the family in Baltic amber. Elektrithone is the first member of Ithonidae to be discovered in Baltic amber. Using the Comstock‚ÄìNeedham system for describing insect venation patterns, the Elektrithone CuP (cubitus posterior, the \\"rear elbow\\") venation is similar to members of the neuropteran families Brongniartiellidae and Osmylopsychopidae, in that the CuP in both families is short and not comb like. However, both families have wings with an anal area that has at least one or two highly branched anal veins, a character that is not seen in Elektrithone. The broad costal area of Elektrithone along with the strongly curved humeral veinlet, comb like MP (medial posterior) and CuA (cubitus anterior) veins and the series structure of the radial crossveins are all features seen in Ithonidae. The features found in Elektrithone are a mosaic of characters found in several genera of Ithonids. Description The holotype is composed of a single partially complete forewing which is missing a section of the central wing area. The preserved section of the forewing is approximately long and wide, with an estimated length, if whole, of . The wing has a costal space that is wide, widening towards the wing base and a number of trichosors are present along the leading edge of the wing. The ScA (subcostal anterior) veinlet is well developed, thick, and connecting to the ScP (subcostal posterior) vein before the humeral veinlet. The subcostal veinlets mostly are only shallowly forked, and the radial crossveins being grouped into a pair of gradate series. The wing does not show any evidence that nygma were present in life.

It is defined as ischemic rest pain, arterial insufficiency ulcers, and gangrene. The latter two conditions are jointly referred to as tissue loss, reflecting the development of surface damage to the limb tissue due to the most severe stage of ischemia. Compared to the other manifestation of PAD, intermittent claudication, CLI has a negative prognosis within a year after the initial diagnosis, with 1-year amputation rates of approximately 12% and mortality of 50% at 5 years and 70% at 10 years. CLI was conceived to identify patients at high-risk for major amputation, but the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus has led to a broader conception of limb threat that includes the risk of amputation associated with severely infected and non-healing wounds. Signs and symptoms Critical limb ischemia includes rest pain and tissue loss. Rest pain Rest pain is a continuous burning pain of the lower leg or feet. It begins, or is aggravated, after reclining or elevating the limb and is relieved by sitting or standing. It is more severe than intermittent claudication, which is also a pain in the legs from arterial insufficiency. Tissue loss Tissue loss is the development of arterial insufficiency ulcers or gangrene due to peripheral artery disease. Diagnosis Critical limb ischemia is diagnosed by the presence of ischemic rest pain, and an ulcers that will not heal or gangrene due to insufficient blood flow. Insufficient blood flow may be confirmed by ankle-brachial index (ABI), ankle pressure, toe-brachial index (TBI), toe systolic pressure, transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TcPo2 ), or skin perfusion pressure (SPP). Other factors which may point to a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia are a Buerger's angle of less than 20 degrees during Buerger's test, a capillary refill of more than 15 seconds or diminished or absent pulses. Critical limb ischemia is different from acute limb ischemia. Acute limb ischemia is a sudden lack of blood flow to the limb, for example caused by an embolus whereas critical limb ischemia is a late sign of a progressive chronic disease. Treatment Treatment mirrors that of other symptoms of peripheral artery disease, and includes modifying risk factors, revascularization via vascular bypass or angioplasty, and in the case of tissue loss, wound debridement. Research As of 2015 pCMV-vegf165, a gene-therapy was being studied in critical limb ischemia. In 2014, a trial was started to better understand the best revascularization technique for CLI. As of 2017, it had enrolled nearly half of the 2100 people needed to complete the trial. A similar study, BASIL 2 (Bypass Versus Angio plasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg), is being conducted in the United Kingdom.

She was the wife of John B. Kelly Sr., three-time Olympic Gold Medal winner in rowing, and mother of Grace Kelly, actress and princess consort of Monaco, and of John B. Kelly Jr., an accomplished rower. She is also a maternal grandmother of Albert II, Prince of Monaco. Early life and education Margaret Katherine Majer was born on December 13, 1898 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of German immigrants, Carl Majer (1863-1922) and Margaretha Berg (1870-1949). Margaret and her two siblings grew up in the Strawberry Mansion section of the city. Margaret went to school and was the 1917 class president at William Penn High School for Girls with the Great-Grandmother of the Fine Brothers. Academic career After earning her B.A. from Temple University in 1921, Majer succeeded Ethel Loring as instructor in Physical Education for Women at the University of Pennsylvania's College for Women. She led the undergraduate women in athletic pursuits at the Kingsessing facility used as a gymnasium by Penn's female students. While teaching at Penn, Majer became the first coach of women's athletic teams at the university, organizing and training a women's basketball team and scheduling the first intercollegiate competitions for women. The women's basketball team played eight opponents in its first year, including Bryn Mawr College, Drexel University, and Temple University. Teams in gymnastics, softball, swimming, and tennis were planned for the next year. Majer also led a successful fundraising campaign to build women's tennis courts on what, for a few years, was a vacant lot on the southeast corner of Thirty-Fourth and Walnut streets. After only three years at Penn, Majer's achievements brought her well-earned celebrity as the founder of women's athletics at Penn. Marriage and children Majer married Olympic oarsman John Brendan Kelly in 1924, ten years after they first met at a neighborhood swimming pool. Kelly, the son of an Irish Catholic immigrant and ten years her senior, won an Olympic gold medal for sculling in 1920. After working in the brickmaking businesses of two older brothers, he started his own business, eventually becoming a millionaire. He was also involved in politics. After serving as Democratic City chairman, he ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for mayor of Philadelphia in 1935 and would also have run for senator if his wife had not discouraged the move. Majer's family was Lutheran, and she converted to Catholicism before the marriage. They had four children: Margaret Katherine (1925‚Äì1991), John Brendan, Jr. (1927‚Äì1985), Grace Patricia (1929‚Äì1982) and Elizabeth Anne (1933‚Äì2009). Later life After her children were all in school, Margaret Majer Kelly became active in various civic organizations. In 1935, she began a long association with the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, serving on its auxiliary and board of corporators before chairing the development program and then receiving an honorary doctor of letters from the school. In recognition of her contributions, the Woman's Medical College named a section of the hospital for her. She also served as a member of the Philadelphia Board of Education from 1961 to 1964 and as a leader of volunteer boards and groups associated with the Philadelphia Association for Retarded Children, Moss Rehabilitation Hospital and the Committee for Philadelphia House. Margaret Majer Kelly died of pneumonia on January 6, 1990 in Linwood, New Jersey.

Background Jumonville graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge with a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Business. He is affiliated with the non-denominational Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge. Jumonville began raising horses as a teenager on his family's farm-ranch. He is also retired from the oil, natural gas, and insurance industries. As a state senator, he promoted the interests of the state's booming horse industry. He and wife, the former Beverly \\"Bunny\\" Callais (born August 1944), live on their ranch at Ventress, on which they reared their three sons, J. E. \\"Tres\\" III, Dutch, and Clayton Jumonville.

Political life In 1976, Jumonville succeeded his father, J. E. Jumonville Sr., in the state Senate. He served until 1992, having been unseated in the general election held on November 16, 1991, by the Democrat, later Republican convert, Thomas A. Greene, a veterinarian from Maringouin in Iberville Parish. Greene defeated Jumonville by 685 votes, 25,523 (50.7 percent) to 24,838 (49.3 percent). In 1995, Greene defeated Jumonville again in a two-candidate primary race, 24,851 (57.6 percent) to 18,289 (42.4 percent). In 1986, Jumonville ran for the United States Senate seat vacated by the retiring Russell B. Long. He finished in fifth place with 52,072 votes (4.4 percent), three votes behind the fourth- place candidate, fellow Democrat Sherman A. Bernard, the four-term Louisiana state insurance commissioner. Victory ultimately went to John Breaux, the Democrat from Crowley, who defeated the Republican Henson Moore of Baton Rouge in the subsequent general election. In 1988, Jumonville ran unsuccessfully for Louisiana's 8th congressional district seat, since disbanded; victory ultimately went to the freshman Republican Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish. In 2003, Jumonville was one of seventeen candidates for governor of Louisiana. He polled only 13,410 votes (1.25 percent). Victory went to his fellow Democrat Kathleen Blanco. A \\"Draft Jumonville\\" movement was launched in 2007 to convince him to run for Louisiana Secretary of State, but he never filed for the office, and victory went to the Republican Jay Dardenne, later the lieutenant governor and now Commissioner of Administration under Governor John Bel Edwards.

He earned his notoriety by painting storefront security gates in West Harlem neighborhoods. Many original pieces can be found today on 125th Street, particularly those surrounding the Apollo Theater (between Frederick Douglass Blvd. and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd). Security gate murals can only be viewed when stores are closed and gates are shut. Franco's murals have helped to make Harlem into an international tourist destination. Franco's work can also be found inside businesses across New York state, as well as in other countries, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, Spain, Brazil, the Caribbean Islands, Senegal, and several other African countries. Franco is a native of Panama and is fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, and English. Early life At the age of three, Franco fell several stories and sustained serious head injuries. After emerging from a one-month coma, he found it difficult to socialize normally and make friends. In an isolated state, he began drawing and cartooning as a way to pass the time, playing with imaginary characters. Not long after, with the encouragement of a local Catholic priest, he later went on to study performance as a stage magician; this helped him to overcome introverted tendencies and build a social life. Franco studied with an artist named Danzig for four years in his youth. Danzig gave him speech lessons and trained him to perform in front of large crowds. He encouraged Franco to move in an entrepreneurial direction, supporting his dream to move to New York and sell his skills as an artist and magician. Art career In 1958, Franco moved to New York and began working immediately, starting with connections he garnered in the Spanish community. In 1968, as a reaction to the riots after Martin Luther King's assassination, storeowners in Harlem added corrugate steel gates to their storefronts. Franco the Great saw these gates as canvases to call for positive change. He began working on Sundays, a day where most stores are closed, as a time to create positivity-promoting and African- American themed murals on the gates. Since then, Franco has painted over two hundred gates, from the East to the West side of 125th Street, and beyond. Many of the security gate murals have since been removed, or repainted grey. In 2008, new zoning laws required storeowners to install \\"see-through\\" gates, which required storeowners to de-install Franco's works. Aside from the gates still currently in use today, twenty five gates have been saved and put away into storage. Supporters of the \\"Save the Gates\\" Campaign hope to have the gates relocated and preserved in Triboro Plaza. In 2011, the Harlem Community Development Corporation was reported to be working on a plan to preserve Franco's gates and have them framed and on permanent display between 1st and 2nd avenues, creating an outdoor gallery. Framing the gates would cost an estimated $250,000. In December 2014, developer Forest City Ratner announced plans to showcase the remaining gates in East River Plaza, as an homage to the Harlem of the past.

The standard case is when X is a scheme and O its structure sheaf. If O is the constant sheaf \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{Z}}, then a sheaf of O-modules is the same as a sheaf of abelian groups (i.e., an abelian sheaf). If X is the prime spectrum of a ring R, then any R-module defines an OX-module (called an associated sheaf) in a natural way. Similarly, if R is a graded ring and X is the Proj of R, then any graded module defines an OX-module in a natural way. O-modules arising in such a fashion are examples of quasi-coherent sheaves, and in fact, on affine or projective schemes, all quasi-coherent sheaves are obtained this way. Sheaves of modules over a ringed space form an abelian category.Vakil, Math 216: Foundations of algebraic geometry, 2.5. Moreover, this category has enough injectives, and consequently one can and does define the sheaf cohomology \\\\operatorname{H}^i(X, -) as the i-th right derived functor of the global section functor \\\\Gamma(X, -).This cohomology functor coincides with the right derived functor of the global section functor in the category of abelian sheaves; cf.  Examples  *Given a ringed space (X, O), if F is an O-submodule of O, then it is called the sheaf of ideals or ideal sheaf of O, since for each open subset U of X, F(U) is an ideal of the ring O(U). *Let X be a smooth variety of dimension n. Then the tangent sheaf of X is the dual of the cotangent sheaf \\\\Omega_X and the canonical sheaf \\\\omega_X is the n-th exterior power (determinant) of \\\\Omega_X. *A sheaf of algebras is a sheaf of module that is also a sheaf of rings.  Operations  Let (X, O) be a ringed space. If F and G are O-modules, then their tensor product, denoted by :F \\\\otimes_O G or F \\\\otimes G, is the O-module that is the sheaf associated to the presheaf U \\\\mapsto F(U) \\\\otimes_{O(U)} G(U). (To see that sheafification cannot be avoided, compute the global sections of O(1) \\\\otimes O(-1) = O where O(1) is Serre's twisting sheaf on a projective space.) Similarly, if F and G are O-modules, then :\\\\mathcal{H}om_O(F, G) denotes the O-module that is the sheaf U \\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{O|_U}(F|_U, G|_U).There is a canonical homomorphism: :\\\\mathcal{H}om_O(F, O)_x \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{O_x} (F_x, O_x), which is an isomorphism if F is of finite presentation (EGA, Ch. 0, 5.2.6.) In particular, the O-module :\\\\mathcal{H}om_O(F, O) is called the dual module of F and is denoted by \\\\check F. Note: for any O-modules E, F, there is a canonical homomorphism :\\\\check{E} \\\\otimes F \\\\to \\\\mathcal{H}om_O(E, F), which is an isomorphism if E is a locally free sheaf of finite rank. In particular, if L is locally free of rank one (such L is called an invertible sheaf or a line bundle),For coherent sheaves, having a tensor inverse is the same as being locally free of rank one; in fact, there is the following fact: if F \\\\otimes G \\\\simeq O and if F is coherent, then F, G are locally free of rank one. (cf. EGA, Ch 0, 5.4.3.) then this reads: :\\\\check{L} \\\\otimes L \\\\simeq O, implying the isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves form a group. This group is called the Picard group of X and is canonically identified with the first cohomology group \\\\operatorname{H}^1(X, \\\\mathcal{O}^*) (by the standard argument with ƒåech cohomology). If E is a locally free sheaf of finite rank, then there is an O-linear map \\\\check{E} \\\\otimes E \\\\simeq \\\\operatorname{End}_O(E) \\\\to O given by the pairing; it is called the trace map of E. For any O-module F, the tensor algebra, exterior algebra and symmetric algebra of F are defined in the same way. For example, the k-th exterior power :\\\\wedge^k F is the sheaf associated to the presheaf U \\\\mapsto \\\\wedge^k_{O(U)} F(U). If F is locally free of rank n, then \\\\wedge^n F is called the determinant line bundle (though technically invertible sheaf) of F, denoted by det(F). There is a natural perfect pairing: :\\\\wedge^r F \\\\otimes \\\\wedge^{n-r} F \\\\to \\\\operatorname{det}(F). Let f: (X, O) ‚Üí(X, O) be a morphism of ringed spaces. If F is an O-module, then the direct image sheaf f_* F is an O-module through the natural map O ‚Üíf*O (such a natural map is part of the data of a morphism of ringed spaces.) If G is an O-module, then the module inverse image f^* G of G is the O-module given as the tensor product of modules: :f^{-1} G \\\\otimes_{f^{-1} O'} O where f^{-1} G is the inverse image sheaf of G and f^{-1} O' \\\\to O is obtained from O' \\\\to f_* O by adjuction. There is an adjoint relation between f_* and f^*: for any O-module F and O'-module G, :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_{O}(f^* G, F) \\\\simeq \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{O'}(G, f_*F) as abelian group. There is also the projection formula: for an O-module F and a locally free O'-module E of finite rank, :f_*(F \\\\otimes f^*E) \\\\simeq f_* F \\\\otimes E.  Properties  Let (X, O) be a ringed space. An O-module F is said to be generated by global sections if there is a surjection of O-modules: :\\\\oplus_{i \\\\in I} O \\\\to F \\\\to 0. Explicitly, this means that there are global sections si of F such that the images of si in each stalk Fx generates Fx as Ox-module. An example of such a sheaf is that associated in algebraic geometry to an R-module M, R being any commutative ring, on the spectrum of a ring Spec(R). Another example: according to Cartan's theorem A, any coherent sheaf on a Stein manifold is spanned by global sections. (cf. Serre's theorem A below.) In the theory of schemes, a related notion is ample line bundle. (For example, if L is an ample line bundle, some power of it is generated by global sections.) An injective O-module is flasque (i.e., all restrictions maps F(U) ‚Üí F(V) are surjective.) Since a flasque sheaf is acyclic in the category of abelian sheaves, this implies that the i-th right derived functor of the global section functor \\\\Gamma(X, -) in the category of O-modules coincides with the usual i-th sheaf cohomology in the category of abelian sheaves.see also: https://math.stackexchange.com/q/447234  Sheaf associated to a module  Let M be a module over a ring A. Put X = Spec A and write D(f) = \\\\\\\\{ f e 0 \\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A[f^{-1}]). For each pair D(f) \\\\subseteq D(g), by the universal property of localization, there is a natural map :\\\\rho_{g, f}: M[g^{-1}] \\\\to M[f^{-1}] having the property that \\\\rho_{g, f} = \\\\rho_{g, h} \\\\circ \\\\rho_{h, f}. Then :D(f) \\\\mapsto M[f^{-1}] is a contravariant functor from the category whose objects are the sets D(f) and morphisms the inclusions of sets to the category of abelian groups. One can show it is in fact a B-sheaf (i.e., it satisfies the gluing axiom) and thus defines the sheaf \\\\widetilde{M} on X called the sheaf associated to M. The most basic example is the structure sheaf on X; i.e., \\\\mathcal{O}_X = \\\\widetilde{A}. Moreover, \\\\widetilde{M} has the structure of \\\\mathcal{O}_X = \\\\widetilde{A}-module and thus one gets the exact functor M \\\\mapsto \\\\widetilde{M} from ModA, the category of modules over A to the category of modules over \\\\mathcal{O}_X. It defines an equivalence from ModA to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on X, with the inverse \\\\Gamma(X, -), the global section functor. When X is Noetherian, the functor is an equivalence from the category of finitely generated A-modules to the category of coherent sheaves on X. The construction has the following properties: for any A-modules M, N, *M[f^{-1}]^{\\\\sim} = \\\\widetilde{M}|_{D(f)}. *For any prime ideal p of A, \\\\widetilde{M}_p \\\\simeq M_p as Op = Ap-module. *(M \\\\otimes_A N)^{\\\\sim} \\\\simeq \\\\widetilde{M} \\\\otimes_{\\\\widetilde{A}} \\\\widetilde{N}. *If M is finitely presented, \\\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M, N)^{\\\\sim} \\\\simeq \\\\mathcal{H}om_{\\\\widetilde{A}}(\\\\widetilde{M}, \\\\widetilde{N}). *\\\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M, N) \\\\simeq \\\\Gamma(X, \\\\mathcal{H}om_{\\\\widetilde{A}}(\\\\widetilde{M}, \\\\widetilde{N})), since the equivalence between ModA and the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on X. *(\\\\varinjlim M_i)^{\\\\sim} \\\\simeq \\\\varinjlim \\\\widetilde{M_i}; in particular, taking a direct sum and ~ commute.  Sheaf associated to a graded module  There is a graded analog of the construction and equivalence in the preceding section. Let R be a graded ring generated by degree-one elements as R0-algebra (R0 means the degree-zero piece) and M a graded R-module. Let X be the Proj of R (so X is a projective scheme if R is Noetherian). Then there is an O-module \\\\widetilde{M} such that for any homogeneous element f of positive degree of R, there is a natural isomorphism :\\\\widetilde{M}|_{\\\\\\\\{f e 0\\\\\\\\}} \\\\simeq (M[f^{-1}]_0)^{\\\\sim} as sheaves of modules on the affine scheme \\\\\\\\{f e 0\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R[f^{-1}]_0); in fact, this defines \\\\widetilde{M} by gluing. Example: Let R(1) be the graded R-module given by R(1)n = Rn+1. Then O(1) = \\\\widetilde{R(1)} is called Serre's twisting sheaf, which is the dual of the tautological line bundle if R is finitely generated in degree-one. If F is an O-module on X, then, writing F(n) = F \\\\otimes O(n), there is a canonical homomorphism: :(\\\\oplus_{n \\\\ge 0} \\\\Gamma(X, F(n)))^{\\\\sim} \\\\to F, which is an isomorphism if and only if F is quasi-coherent.  Computing sheaf cohomology  Sheaf cohomology has a reputation for being difficult to calculate. Because of this, the next general fact is fundamental for any practical computation: Serre's theorem A states that if X is a projective variety and F a coherent sheaf on it, then, for sufficiently large n, F(n) is generated by finitely many global sections. Moreover, :(a) For each i, Hi(X, F) is finitely generated over R0, and :(b) (Serre's theorem B) There is an integer n0, depending on F, such that ::\\\\operatorname{H}^i(X, F(n)) = 0, \\\\, i \\\\ge 1, n \\\\ge n_0.  Sheaf extension  Let (X, O) be a ringed space, and let F, H be sheaves of O-modules on X. An extension of H by F is a short exact sequence of O-modules :0 \\\\rightarrow F \\\\rightarrow G \\\\rightarrow H \\\\rightarrow 0. As with group extensions, if we fix F and H, then all equivalence classes of extensions of H by F form an abelian group (cf. Baer sum), which is isomorphic to the Ext group \\\\mathrm{Ext}_O^1(H,F), where the identity element in \\\\mathrm{Ext}_O^1(H,F) corresponds to the trivial extension. In the case where H is O, we have: for any i ‚â• 0, :\\\\operatorname{H}^i(X, F) = \\\\mathrm{Ext}_O^i(O,F), since both the sides are the right derived functors of the same functor \\\\Gamma(X, -) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}_O(O, -). Note: Some authors, notably Hartshorne, drop the subscript O. Assume X is a projective scheme over a Noetherian ring. Let F, G be coherent sheaves on X and i an integer. Then there exists n0 such that :\\\\operatorname{Ext}_O^i(F, G(n)) = \\\\Gamma(X, \\\\mathcal{E}xt_O^i(F, G(n))), \\\\, n \\\\ge n_0.  Locally Free Resolutions  \\\\mathcal{Ext}(\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathcal{G}) can be readily computed for any coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} using a locally free resolution: given a complex : \\\\cdots \\\\to \\\\mathcal{L}_2 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{L}_1 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{L}_0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\to 0 then : \\\\mathcal{RHom}(\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathcal{G}) = \\\\mathcal{Hom}(\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\bullet,\\\\mathcal{G}) hence :\\\\mathcal{Ext}^k(\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathcal{G}) = h^k(\\\\mathcal{Hom}(\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\bullet,\\\\mathcal{G}))  Examples  Hypersurface Consider a smooth hypersurface X of degree d. Then, we can compute a resolution :\\\\mathcal{O}(-d) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O} and find that :\\\\mathcal{Ext}^i(\\\\mathcal{O}_X,\\\\mathcal{F}) = h^i(\\\\mathcal{Hom}(\\\\mathcal{O}(-d) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}, \\\\mathcal{F})) Union of Smooth Complete Intersections Consider the scheme :X = \\\\text{Proj}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n]}{(f)(g_1,g_2,g_3)} \\\\right) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{P}^n where (f,g_1,g_2,g_3) is a smooth complete intersection and \\\\text{deg}(f) = d, \\\\text{deg}(g_i) = e_i.

It was designed by John Hall & Son and built from 1891 to 1891. It is also known as Toombul Divisional Board Offices. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Toombul Shire Hall at Nundah was constructed in 1891 as a combination of municipal offices and public hall for the Toombul Divisional Board. Construction of the 1891 building was made necessary following the 1890 separation of the Town of Hamilton from the Division of Toombul, which had been created under the Divisional Boards Act of 1879. Following this split the Hamilton Town Council met at the Toombul Divisional Board's old offices at Breakfast Creek, and the Toombul Divisional Board rented premises at Nundah until they could afford the construction of new offices. In mid-1891 Toombul Divisional Board approached architects John Hall and Son to design sketch plans for new divisional board offices. This architectural firm had designed the South Brisbane Town Hall, which was under construction. The Board agreed on 1 August 1891 that the architects be instructed to prepare plans for board offices, a hall and a clerk's residence, from amended sketch plans. It appears that the clerk's residence was located to the south of the offices and hall, on the Board's property, fronting Sandgate Road. An application to the colonial treasury for a loan of ¬£1400 was refused, but the Council went ahead with construction in late 1891, probably using day labour. By 2 January 1892 the Toombul Divisional Board was meeting in its new boardroom. Construction had strained the Board's budget, and by early 1892 the Board's bank account was overdrawn by ¬£1460. Rentals for use of the hall were set at 10 shillings per evening for religious services and 30 shillings per night for balls and functions. Toombul Divisional Board became Toombul Shire Council in 1903, following the introduction of the Local Government Act of 1902. Toombul Shire Hall remained the property of Toombul Shire Council, continuing to serve the local community as shire offices and public hall, until taken over by the Brisbane City Council following the creation of Greater Brisbane in 1925. Subsequently, the site was used as a works depot and the building as the regional health inspector's office and public hall. In 1928 a skillion-roofed meeting room was added at the rear, side verandahs were attached to the hall and wing spaces were created on the stage. In 1987-88 the Brisbane City Council undertook restorative and renovation work which included interior and exterior painting in heritage colours, repair and repointing of the exterior brickwork, re-roofing and recladding of the hall walls with galvanised corrugated iron, replacement of timbers in the pediment, and opening up of the northern verandah, which had been enclosed by this date. The building continues to serve the local community as a popular function and meeting venue.  Description  Interior view of the hall, 2011 The former Toombul Shire Hall is located flush to the pavement on Sandgate Road, a major arterial road to the northern suburbs and Bruce Highway. It is a long, narrow building designed to combine the functions of municipal offices and public hall, with the offices at the front of the building sharing a central entrance and vestibule with the public hall behind. Verandahs run either side down the length of the hall, with brick-based and asbestos-clad toilet blocks attached to the southern verandah. The building is timber-framed and incorporates a gradation in cladding fabric: a brick facade to Sandgate Road; chamferboard walls to the offices; and corrugated iron sheeting to the hall behind. The classically styled facade of red brickwork with white strings and arches features a central round-arched portico with low-arched openings on either side, forming a brick balustraded verandah to the left, and an office to the right. A front ramp for wheelchair access is a recent addition. At the front the building rests on shallow brick foundations, but as the land slopes away towards the rear these are replaced by timber stumps. Above the public hall is a long gabled roof of corrugated iron with tall galvanised ventilators along the crown. The office section has a hipped roof, also iron covered, with a steeply pitched pediment over the entrance portico. The pediment is infilled with imitation half-timbering. The site includes a sizeable area of land to the rear which has been utilised as a works depot housing a number of sheds and equipment. The ground facing Sandgate Road to the south of the hall has been asphalted and fenced with wire mesh. There are no visible remains of any landscaping.  Heritage listing  Toombul Shire Hall (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Toombul Shire Hall, erected in 1891, is significant historically for its association with the work of the Toombul Divisional Board and Toombul Shire Council for over 3 decades, and is significant as a late 19th century expression of local authority status within a Queensland community. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is the only surviving, non-masonry shire hall retained by the Brisbane City Council. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building remains substantially intact, and is an excellent example of 19th century, timber- framed, municipal hall construction in Queensland. The gradation in materials from brick facade to timber-clad front offices to galvanised iron hall, remains an evocative illustration of the tight financial budgets under which most Queensland divisional boards operated. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place is important for its landmark quality and aesthetic and historic contribution to the Nundah townscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Toombul Shire Hall, erected in 1891, is significant historically for its association with the work of the Toombul Divisional Board and Toombul Shire Council for over 3 decades, and is significant as a late 19th century expression of local authority status within a Queensland community.

The spill was called following the resignation of Opposition Leader John Robertson on 23 December 2014. It elected Shadow Environment Minister Luke Foley as the next parliamentary Leader of the New South Wales Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition in the lead-up to the March election, despite Foley not holding a seat in the Legislative Assembly. In the lead-up to the spill, Deputy Leader Linda Burney, served as interim Leader of the Opposition and she continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly after the spill. Background The Liberal‚ÄìNational Coalition won the 2011 election in a landslide victory, reducing the parliamentary Labor party to twenty seats in the Legislative Assembly. In the aftermath, Transport Minister John Robertson was elected as leader of the Labor Party in opposition with Linda Burney appointed as his deputy. Following revelations that Robertson had sent a letter on behalf of the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis gunman, Man Haron Monis, a constituent in his Blacktown electorate, to the Department of Family and Community Services in support of Monis' request for a supervised visit with his children on Father's Day in 2011, pressure mounted on Robertson to resign as Leader of the Labor Party. Robertson announced his resignation on 23 December 2014 with the 2015 state election three months away. The first nominee to announce their candidacy for the leadership was Shadow Treasurer Michael Daley, who was followed by Shadow Police Minister Steve Whan on 24 December. While many within the party favoured Shadow Environment Minister Luke Foley to succeed Robertson, his position in the Legislative Council made it difficult for him to lead the parliamentary party with all Labor preselections for winnable Legislative Assembly seats already decided excepting Auburn, a seat involved in an internal dispute between incumbent MP Barbara Perry and her challenger, Auburn councillor Hicham Zraika, whom Perry accused of branch-stacking. On 29 December, Foley announced that he would contest the leadership and the Auburn pre-selection. Following Foley's announcement, Steve Whan withdrew from the race, citing insufficient support.

() is a privately held manufacturer of dance shoes, wear and accessories. The company was founded in 1989 by Nikolay Grishko in Moscow, Russia. It is an international company with four factories in Europe and sales in over 70 countries. The company began as a pointe shoe manufacturer and now produces many types of dance shoes and wear.  History  Nikolay decided to start the Grishko company after hearing dancers complain about their footwear through his wife, a former ballerina. Shortly after starting the company in the early 1990s, many of the theatre workshops in Russia were forced to close and Nikolai recruited the master craftsmen from these theatre workshops to work with him. Nikolai also recruited the only person to date to have a PhD in ballet shoe technology and mechanics. As of 2014, the company consists of four factories in Europe, a flagship store in Moscow Russia and over 500 employees, including 76 people with registered disabilities. As of September 11, 2019, Grishko operates in the United States of America under the name Nikolay as the result of a legal battle with their US distributor, I.M. Wilson.  Production  Grishko pointe shoes are handmade using all natural materials and tested by professional dancers. Grishko has developed several pointe shoe innovations such as using nano-technology to improve foot health, working with navy acoustics labs to reduce noise on stage and collaborating with a laboratory of starch products to develop better glues. Grishko flagship store - Moscow, Russia  Products  Grishko's footwear line includes shoes for pointe, ballet, ballroom, jazz, acro, contemporary, gymnastics, character and theatre. The pointe shoes are based on four main shapes, called \\"lasts\\" - the Grishko 2007, the Fouette, the Vaganova and the Elite. Grishko currently offers 26 different models of pointe shoes. The most recent pointe shoe added to the line is based on the Grishko 2007 last and is called the DreamPointe. The dancewear line includes leotards for ballet and gymnastics, warm-up boots, tights, stage costumes, knitwear, fitness, yoga, pilates and general active lifestyle wear. The Grishko dancewear workshop handcrafts intricate tutus, costumes and shoes. The company also produces dance accessories, such as toe pads, bags, ribbons, elastics and overlays. In 2014, Grishko created and produced its first 'haute couture' dancewear line in collaboration with Diana Vishneva and Tatyana Parfionova.  Notable appearances  In the December 2014 issue of Vogue, Annie Leibovitz photographed Amy Adams wearing Grishko's Nova 2007 model pointe shoes.

It was built in 1938. It is also known as First Free Settlers of Queensland Memorial Cairn. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 June 1998.  History  The First Free Settlers Monument at Nundah, a blunt tapered octagon of rusticated sandstone blocks, commemorates the centenary of the arrival of free settlers in the Moreton Bay district which was later to become a part of Queensland. It was unveiled on Easter Saturday 23 April 1938 as a part of Nundah's celebration of the centenary of Queensland's free settlement. The original group of settlers were recruited for the colony by the Rev. John Dunmore Lang who had heard of the works of their leader, Pastor Johannes Evangelista Gossner during his journey to England to recruit free settlers. Lang had a vision for improving the calibre of Australia's settlers by encouraging people of good Protestant stock to emigrate. Gossner had established a community in Germany where he trained lay people for missionary work. These people eminently filled the requirements that Dunmore Lang had established for his free settlers and he encourage Gossner to prepare a group for travel to Moreton Bay. In 1837, ten men volunteered to travel to Moreton Bay which was, at the time a convict settlement based at Brisbane. The men, inspired by Lang's descriptions, intended to establish a mission for the Aborigines living in the vicinity of the convict settlement. Several of the men brought their wives and families with them. Two clergymen joined the group to provide pastoral care and guidance to the mission. Each of the lay men had practical skills with trades such as shoemaking, farming, brickmaking, tailoring, blacksmithing and medicine which would assist in the establishment of the proposed missionary colony. Schneider, the medical student, died of typhus at the quarantine station in Sydney on his arrival in the new country. Four more men arrived in 1844 to further the work of the mission, however although accepted by the local Aborigines, the settlers were unsuccessful in their efforts to convert them to Christianity. The original settlement of Zion was located on the rise behind Toombul Shopping Centre in the vicinity of the street now known as Walkers Way. It was watered by Kedron Brook, now contained within an artificial canal. The mission itself was unsuccessful in converting any of the local Aborigines, but when, in 1848, the Government surveyed the land into blocks, many of the original settlers and their families chose to remain and purchase the land for their own use. The area became known as German Station as a consequence of their presence and was later renamed Nundah, as the suburb is now known. Many of the first free settlers are buried in Nundah Cemetery established in the 1840s. Monument in 2015 The monument was erected as a consequence of the suggestion of George Joy Walker, born 1852 who, as an infant in arms had travelled with his family to the settlement at Zion when his father was appointed as tutor to the families of the first settlers. Walker died in 1933 and never saw the monument, although he would have been aware of the activities of the First Free Settlers Committee which took up the challenge with which he had presented them. The location of the monument was described as the intersection of new and old Sandgate Roads (old Sandgate Road passing through the Nundah shopping street and new Sandgate Road passing through the George Bridges Tunnel) and the original setting of the cairn is shown in early photographs as being a broad swathe of mown grass which has subsequently been formalised into the clearly defined space evident today. The monument was designed to \\"rise from the turf without step or platform, symbolising the growth of European civilisation in Queensland out of the soil of Nundah.\\" It was unveiled by His Excellency the Governor, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, under the auspices of the First Free Settlers Committee. The unveiling ceremony was broadcast by radio station 4QG and a celebration ball was held in the evening. Each year, in October, a ceremony is held at the memorial to commemorate the arrival of the first free settlers. The ceremony is generally attended by representatives of both Queensland and local government, diplomats, as well as local residents and others who are descended from the first missionary settlers.  Description  Plaque, 2015 Eastern plaque The First Free Settlers Monument is located at the corner of Sandgate Road and Bage Street in Nundah. It stands within a small park dedicated to the first free settlement in Queensland. The monument itself consists of a simple, blunt octagonal cairn which tapers towards the top and rises without step or platform from the surrounding grass. It is constructed from rusticated sandstone blocks and on four faces are fixed bronze plaques explaining the purpose of the dedication and the occasion which it celebrates. The southern plaque lists the names of the original male settlers, the eastern plaque indicates that the memorial was dedicated by the people of Queensland on the occasion of the centenary of free European settlement in Queensland. The northern plaque refers to the work of John Dunmore Lang and Goszner and the western refers to the past and present British rulers. The penultimate course of stonework has a sawn face which contains incised lettering, gilded, which reads \\"Queensland's First Free Settlers\\". The word \\"free\\" is placed above the plaque naming the settlers. The park is well-maintained and stands surrounded by streets. Sandgate Road passes along the straight side of the park to the north-east, while Bage Street passes on the south-western side. The remaining side is flanked by a short divided road (unnamed) which provides access to Bage Street from Sandgate Road. The park is curved in form with a low, clipped plumbago hedge surrounding it. A low curved garden edge constructed from concrete embedded with a variety of small stones surrounds the hedge, of which that on the Bage Street side is more recently planted than that on the opposite side. Two poinciana trees flank the memorial and a bench is located under the south-eastern tree, which is a replacement of the originally planted tree. A cast iron drinking fountain is located in front of the bench. Entrance is gained through two breaks in the hedge which are placed on the central axis opposite the memorial. To the left of the entry on the curved side a low stone tablet was placed in 1988 marking the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of free settlement which coincided with Australia's Bicentenary. The plaque re- confirms German-Australian friendship. Three flagpoles are placed at regular intervals along the northern side of the park and a timber sign of more recent origin is placed to the western side of the northern entrance to clearly identify the monument to the passing traffic on Sandgate Road. Tablet 1: Pastor Eipper, Pastor W Schmidt, Lay Missionaries, L Doege, F T Franz, A T W Hartenstein, G Hauszmann, P Niquet, A Olbrecht, A Rode. G Wagner, J L Zillmann.

(Bill) Gunn, Deputy Premier, Minister for Public Works, Main Roads and Expo and Police and Dr Karl-Heinz Berninger Consul-General for the Federal Republic of Germany in commemoration of 150 years first free settlement in Queensland by German Missionaries who settled in 1838 at Walkers Way, Nundah.

Balwant Singh was a farmer in Nandgarh, Bathinda, Punjab, India. In 1997, he became a member of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). According to Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Nandgarh was given ticket to contest elections for SGPC because he was the only applicant to introduce himself as \\"Khalsa\\". In 2003, he was made the Jathedar of Takht Sri Damdama Sahib. In 2007, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of Dera Sacha Sauda had appeared in an advertisement dressed up as Guru Gobind Singh, 10th Sikh guru. This resulted in a widespread clashes between Dera followers and Sikhs. Nandgarh formed a Sikh group called Ek Noor Khalsa Fauj to stop the religious gathering of Dera Sacha Sauda. Nanakshahi calendar Nandgarh has supported the 2003 version of Nanakshahi calendar, a solar calendar also known as the Mool Nanakshahi Calendar created by Pal Singh Purewal to determine the dates for various Sikh events.https://www.theworldsikhnews.com/nanakshahi-calendar-is-immortal/ In 1999,https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikh-festivals/the-sikh-calendar- gurupurabs-and-festival-dateshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanakshahi_calendar this calendar was adopted by SGPC, replacing the lunar Bikrami calendar. However, the Nanakshahi calendar created some confusion, as the dates of some festivals such as Holi and Diwali, and birthdays of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh differed from the corresponding dates in the Bikrami calendar. In 2009, SGPC amended the calendar and fixed the dates of these festivals according to the Bikirami calendar. In 2014‚Äì15, according to the amended Nanakshahi calendar, Guru Gobind Singh's birthday fell on 28 December 2014, which overlaps with the martyrdom day of his younger sons. To resolve this, SGPC announced 7 January 2015 as the new date for celebrating Guru Gobind Singh's birthday. Later, SGPC backtracked and re-announced 28 December 2014 as the date for the event. As per the 2003 Nanakshahi calendar, the date of this event was 5 January. Nandgarh asked people to celebrate the event on 5 January. He was supported by various other Sikh organizations which demanded that the 2003 Nanakshahi calendar should be re-implemented. Nandgarh's support was seen as going against the SGPC and the ruling party of Punjab Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2011, the Nanakshahi calendar had been released by Ek Noor Khalsa Fauj under the patronage of Nandgarh. On 17 January 2015, Nandgarh was removed from the office of Jathedar by the SGPC. According to SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar, Nandgarh had violated the Sikh Rehat Maryada (religious code of conducts) and disobeyed certain decisions made by SGPC. Several Sikh organizations such as Dal Khalsa, Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee criticized the manner in which Nandgarh was removed from his post.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Nundah as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building (now MacArthur Central) at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. Private air raid shelter, Nundah, circa 1942 The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost . Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non- reusable standard pillboxes. Frank Gibson Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that if the emergency for their use does not arise ... (unused shelters) ... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war. Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built- referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\"- and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Nundah were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. The original floor slab has been covered with concrete pebbles or tiles. The shelter has been enclosed with concrete walls to accommodate public toilets and a mural has been painted on the exterior of the walls. Skylights have been cut into the roof slab.  Description  Entrance, 2015 The Nundah air raid shelter stands on a small triangular wedge of grassed reserve. It is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a flat roof supported by concrete piers. Two-thirds of the shelter accommodates public toilets enclosed by concrete block walls and a mural is painted around the exterior walls of the building. The concrete floor slab is topped with a concrete pebble finish and the floor within the toilet area is tiled. The piers have wall tiles on the lower ends, and a timber seat is fixed onto the floor slab outside the ladies toilet. Wiring has been introduced for lighting, and skylights have been cut through the yellow roof slab inside the toilets.  Heritage listing  Nundah Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Nundah air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located on the corner of Sandgate Road and Wood Street is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Nundah air raid shelter, now used as a public toilet, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

It was built in 1910. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This house was constructed in 1910 for Caroline and Otto Gustav Weissner, and was the first home constructed under the provisions of the Queensland Worker's Dwelling Act of 1909. The Weissners acquired the Nundah site in June 1909, and on 14 March 1910 they made the first application for housing assistance under the new Act. The result was a mortgage of ¬£190 to the Worker's Dwelling Board, and construction of the house at a total cost of ¬£220. The mortgage was released in August 1925, when the property changed ownership. The design - which probably emanated from the architectural office of the Worker's Dwelling Scheme - was conservative, economical, and typical of Queensland vernacular working class housing of the period. The Worker's Dwelling Act, administered as the Worker's Dwelling Scheme, provided for persons whose income was less than ¬£400 per annum, and who owned a suitable site but no house, to be advanced up to two-thirds of the total value of the site plus the proposed dwelling, to the maximum of ¬£300. Loans were to be repaid over twenty years at 5% interest. The scheme was an early Queensland Government initiative to assist working-class families to build and purchase their own homes, and was the precursor to the Queensland Housing Commission. During the three decades in which the Worker's Dwelling Scheme was in operation, government assistance provided for the construction of 23,515 houses throughout Queensland, and largely created Brisbane's suburban sprawl of the 1920s and 1930s. The popularity of the \\"workers dwelling\\" and later the \\"Queenslander\\" is directly attributable to the success of the Worker's Dwelling Scheme.  Description  Front of the building, 2015 This is a small high-set weatherboard house with a short ridge corrugated iron roof, a full width front verandah with a convex iron roof which is now enclosed, and a half -width rear verandah, also enclosed. Scalloped galvanised iron window shades enhance the side windows, which are sash type. The interior of the core consists of a central hallway and four rooms, with a hipped-roof kitchen projecting at the rear. Exterior modifications have detracted from the building's decorative appeal. In the process of enclosing the front verandah with timber cladding and aluminium windows, a dowelled balustrade, verandah gate and decorative timber posts with capitals and fretwork brackets have been lost. Modern quad guttering has replaced the original ogee profile and acroteria. Timber stumps have been supplanted by concrete and the front fence has been replaced.

It was designed by Atkinson & Conrad and built in 1936 by T F Woollam. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 March 1999.  History  A modest, functional civic building, the Nundah Fire Station has been the operational centre for fire services in Nundah since 1936. Between 1860 and 1868 there were five attempts to form a fire fighting service for Brisbane. Each brigade struggled to survive unable to attract a viable subscription base and hampered by inadequate equipment and an unreliable water supply. The establishment of an effective fire service did not enjoy a high priority among civic and government leaders. A fifth brigade, the City Volunteer Fire Brigade, was established in 1868. New rules provided for better financial control and balanced representation through the Fire Brigade Board with membership from the Brisbane Municipal Council and insurance companies. These arrangements were consolidated by the Fire Brigades Act of 1881. Funding for fire services came from contributions by the Queensland Government, Brisbane Municipal Council, insurance companies and subscriptions. In 1889 the first full-time firemen were employed and a permanent fire brigade was established. A new headquarters, designed by Henry Wallace Atkinson, was completed on the corner of Ann and Edwards Streets (on a corner of the Normal School site) in 1890. This began a long association between the Fire Brigade and the various architectural firms with whom he was associated. The fire fighting needs of the city increased as Brisbane continued to develop. Nundah Fire Brigade was formed by volunteer local residents in 1916 after The Fire Brigades Act Amendment Act of 1902 allowed local authorities to establish independent boards and brigades. Brigades were formed in Hamilton (1917), Windsor 1917, Ithaca 1918, Toowong 1918, Taringa 1919, Wynnum 1921 and Sandgate 1923. These were voluntary bodies with only the superintendent and immediate assistants receiving a salary. The Fire Brigades Act of 1920 rationalised the network of fire brigades in Brisbane and suburbs, centralising control under the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board in 1921. The Nundah Fire Brigade stored its equipment at the Royal Hotel until a shed and bell tower were erected in Union Street, Nundah in 1917. This shed functioned as the Nundah Fire Station until 1936 when the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board was resiting old fire stations and erecting new stations, funded by the Queensland Government, as part of an upgrading of fire services under the Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Ned Hanlon. Under this program, the early fire station at Nundah was demolished and a new purpose-built two storey station was constructed to a design by HW Atkinson and AH Conrad by the contractor TF Woollam. The station was opened by Hanlon on 11 December 1936. Other stations built under this policy include Coorparoo Fire Station, Wynnum Fire Station, Hamilton, Sherwood, Sandgate and Toowong. The new building housed the station facilities on the ground floor and a residence for the superintendent on the first floor. This combination of station and residence was common in fire stations and this plan was duplicated at Wynnum and Coorparoo. In 1990 the Metropolitan Fire Brigade became a division of the Bureau of Emergency Services. The Nundah Fire Station was decommissioned in 1999 and operations transferred to a new station at Hendra. The former fire station was converted into two residential apartments, one on the ground floor and one on the upper floor.  Description  Structure in 2015 The Nundah Fire Station is a two storey, symmetrical timber framed building at the north end of Union Street off Buckland Road and backing onto the railway line. The building is clad with fibrous cement sheeting to the first storey, has timber weatherboards to the lower storey and a terracotta tiled hip roof. On the first floor a central, open verandah balcony projects over the engine room entrance with \\"Nundah Fire Station\\" painted in red across the sheeting to the lower part of the balcony. The black painted horizontal cover battens against the white painted sheeting to the first storey give the building a striking street presence. The ground floor of the Fire Station accommodates the engine room, watch office, locker room and ablutions area, dormitory, kitchen, laundry and duty officer bedroom. The timber pole connecting the residence to the engine room has been sawn off at the first floor level and the pole cupboard is now used for storage at ground level. The locker room contains intact purpose built lockers for the firemen's uniforms and personal effects. The concrete floor to the engine room is marked with red wheel tracks and a concrete footpath crossing connects to the street. The interiors are lined with tongue and groove boarding and the ceilings are sheeted and battened, except the watchroom which is plastered. A brass plaque commemorating the opening of the station is on the engine room wall outside the watch office. The rear external timber stairs have been replaced with metal stairs and the laundry now accommodates an additional shower. Windows to the ground level are shaded by horizontal timber hoods on cantilevered timber brackets and fixed aluminium louvre screens have been added around the windows. The residence on the first floor has a kitchen, living room, dining room, an open verandah balcony, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The living and dining rooms and main bedroom open by French doors onto the verandah balcony. There are glazed fanlights above these French doors and side lights to those off the dining room. The pole connecting the residence and the station below is housed in a cupboard adjacent to the bathroom. The interiors are clad with tongue and groove boarding and the ceilings sheeted and battened. The kitchen cupboards, linen cupboard, dining room cupboard and main bedroom wardrobe remain. The terrazzo floor to the bathroom survives. The grassed and concreted grounds are well maintained. A concrete path leads from a chain and rail gate in the north east corner to the rear stairs to the residence. A concrete driveway to the south east arrives at the hose drying area and shed to the rear of the station. Recently planted palms (Archontophoenix sp.) are to the north and south boundaries and to front of the station.  Heritage listing  Nundah Fire Station (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 March 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Nundah Fire Station is an important example of the upgrading of fire stations undertaken in Brisbane suburbs by the Queensland Government through the Metropolitan Fire Board during the 1930s. The building has been in continual use as a fire station from 1936 to 1999. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Nundah Fire Station is an intact example of the work of the architectural firm Atkinson and Conrad. Nundah Fire Station is a fine intact example of the architecture and planning of Brisbane suburban fire stations of the 1930s incorporating offices and engine room to the ground floor and a residence to the first floor. The interiors in both the operational and domestic areas are intact interiors and reflect the operation of 1930s fire stations. The kitchen is a fine example of an intact domestic interior. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Nundah Fire Station, with its associated grounds, has aesthetic and architectural significance as a modest, functional civic building. Robust and austere, with its simple but striking horizontal banding and use of readily available materials, it is easily identified in the streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Nundah Fire Station is important for the continuing association of the Fire Brigade with the community of Nundah since the establishment of fire fighting services for the area by local resident volunteers in 1916. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Atkinson, through the firms he was associated with, sustained a long association with the Fire Services in Brisbane commencing in 1890 with his design for the new headquarters for the Brisbane Fire Brigade. His architectural practices were responsible for many of the fire stations throughout Brisbane.

It covered political, socio-cultural, and informative functions toward the Arbereshe community and Albanians in general. It also covered thematics such as the Albanian National Awakening and state-forming, Italian-Albanian relationships, as well as political events of a broader spectrum. It was founded and managed by Italian lawyer and publicist Anselmo Lorecchio, an Arbereshe from Pallagorio, Calabria. It published articles from Albanian writers and publicists as well. History The Societ√† Nazionale Albanese (Albanian National Society) was founded in 1895 out of an Arberesh congress held in Corigliano Calabro and led by scholar Girolamo De Rada. Lorecchio would become head of the society in February 1897, during the second congress held in Lungro. Just a few weeks before La Nazione Albanese had already started publishing and served from that moment on as a press organ of the society,Un giornalista arb√´resh al servizio dell‚Äôindipendenza dell‚ÄôAlbania ‚Äì Antonio D‚ÄôAlessandri (Universit√† Roma Tre) although its official newspaper remained Ylli i Arb√´resh√´ve (\\"The star of the Arbereshe\\") published in Corigliano Calabro. On 18 April 1900, the Societ√† Nazionale Albanese transformed into Comitato Nazionale Albanese (Albanian National Committee) and the headquarters were transferred to Rome. The newspaper moved as well and was published there since then, printed in \\"Tipografia Dante Alighieri\\". The death of Lorecchio in 1924 brought the newspaper as well to an end.
