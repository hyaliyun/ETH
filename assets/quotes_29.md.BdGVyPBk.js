It houses administrative offices, an infirmary of the University Health Services, and a retail/restaurant arcade. Design Primarily designed by Jos√© Luis Sert (then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design) and completed in 1966, the Smith Campus Center is an H-shaped ten-story reinforced concrete building. Low-rise portions, including an underground parking garage, have a larger footprint of . The building was constructed in two phases over a six-year period between 1960 and 1966. The first phase‚Äîthe southern half of the building facing Mount Auburn Street-began in 1960 and was occupied in 1962. Construction of the second phase began in 1964 and was completed in 1966. The landscaped area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Dunster Street‚Äîknown as Forbes Plaza‚Äîwas completed the following year in 1967.https://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/CDD/ZoningDevel/HarvardAdvComm/hsac_20150610_1350massave_pt9.pdf?la=en. As a permanent tribute, the plaza and arcade inside the Holyoke Center were named in honor of Edward W. Forbes. The occasion was marked by a ceremony on 17 October, 1966 Beth Andrea Madelbaum and Marjorie Kitchen FitzSimmons, \\"Edward Waldo Forbes: City Planner\\" in Edward Waldo Forbes: Yankee Visionary, Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, MA 1971, pp88 After the first phase of construction in 1963, the Harvard Crimson cited a local joke: \\"The one nice feature about Holyoke Center is that it's the one place in Cambridge from which you can't see Holyoke Center\\". Within a few years the building's novel design and technical features began to present numerous difficulties, which a Harvard official likened to \\"a five-car accident at an intersection. You just can't tell what caused it.\\" These included crumbling of exterior structural concrete and an inefficient three-pipe heating and cooling system. It was Harvard's first highrise building, and has been called a \\"gray elephant\\" for the color of its concrete facades. Artworks From 1964 to 1979, the penthouse dining room was decorated with five large paintings installed by Mark Rothko, an Abstract Expressionist artist. Due to high levels of direct sunlight onto the paintings and the presence of lithol red's calcium salt, the paintings faded severely and were moved to protective storage in 1979. Since their removal, the artworks have been publicly displayed only five times, most recently from November 2014 to July 2015, at the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums.Stenger, J., Khandekar, N., Raskar, R., Cuellar, S., Mohan, A. and Gschwind, R., ‚ÄòConservation of a room: a treatment proposal for Mark Rothko‚Äôs Harvard Murals,‚Äô Studies in Conservation, 61(6), 2016, 348-361Stenger, J., Khandekar, N., Wilker, A., Kallsen, K., Kirby, D.P. and Eremin, K., ‚ÄòThe making of Mark Rothko‚Äôs Harvard Murals,‚Äô Studies in Conservation, 61(6), 2016, 331-347.

But to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 690, it reduces power at night to 5,000 watts.

History Logo as La 69, used from 2001 to 2017 Early Years XEN-AM started as CYS, on 710 kHz. The station was owned by General Electric Mexico from 1925 to 1930. For most of 1930, from February 5 to the end of the year, the station, by then known as \\"Radio Mundial XEN\\" and bearing its current call sign, offered something never before provided on radio: a constant all news radio service. Radio Noticias was owned by F√©lix F. Palavicini, a journalist who acquired the station at the start of the year. The earliest concession for XEN-AM was awarded to Cervecer√≠a Modelo, S.A., in 1934. At that time the station still broadcast on 710 kHz. The next year, the station was transferred to Guillermina Pontones de del Conde, and later it moved to its current dial position on 690 kHz. World Music, Sports and Lounge Music Beginning in the 1950s and until the early 1990s, it carried a world music format as Radio Mundo. In 1993, the station switched to a sports radio format as Radio Sportiva. By the late 1990s it offered lounge music and newscasts under the name Ondas del Lago.Aparece el primer bolet√≠n del a√±o de creadores de la radio, La Jornada 6 February 2001 La 69 In 2001, Grupo Radio Centro bought the indebted station, disaffiliated it from the Cadena RASA system and converted it to a news format, known as La 69 - Es Noticia. The purchase was made possible because the previous year Radio Centro had sold 1320 AM and 1560 AM to Infored.Radio Centro Form 20-F filed in the United States, 2009 However, the station generally lacked unique programming. It mainly aired a simulcast of the two-hour midday newscast of Radio Red, which was hosted by Jacobo Zabludovsky until his death on July 2, 2015, being substituted by Juan Francisco Casta√±eda. The newscast originated on XEN, before moving to Radio Red in 2004. The newscast was recorded and repeated throughout the day and on weekends. A program with Jos√© Alberto Barranco Chavarr√≠a called \\"Entrel√≠neas\\" that beginning July 4, 2016, was also simulcast on Radio Red. Another program, a seven-hour morning talk show, \\"¬øY usted, qu√© opina?\\" hosted by Nino Can√∫n, was cancelled in August 2014. The station's only original programming after 2016 were cultural capsules aired during commercial breaks, having no advertisers outside of government and electoral spots. Radio Centro and El Fon√≥grafo In 2017, citing \\"changes in AM transmission infrastructure,\\" Grupo Radio Centro reorganized all of its AM radio stations. It shut down several stations and consolidating their programs. La 69 was replaced by content from the former XEQR-AM 1030, talk- formatted Radio Centro, and XEJP-AM 1150, El Fon√≥grafo. Radio Centro's sole program to transition to XEN, \\"Buenos D√≠as con H√©ctor Mart√≠nez Serrano\\" airs from 5:30 to 10:00am on weekdays and 5:30 to 11:00am on weekends, with El Fon√≥grafo oldies music filling in the rest of the air time (except for Sundays at noon, when Catholic mass airs). Since July 2019, the station is also used to broadcast soccer matches from Liga MX on Friday nights, as well as UEFA Champions League matches on some weekdays. Besides airing on XEN, El Fon√≥grafo also maintains a separate stream solely dedicated to music without announcers or commercial interruptions, which can also be heard on the HD2 subchannel of XEJP-FM. Mart√≠nez Serrano died on May 9, 2020, with his collaborators taking over the hosting of \\"Buenos D√≠as\\". Beginning on May 18, 2020, XEN began to be simulcasted on XEQR-AM.

Although most known for his spell in California's high school running scene and for a remarkable training regimen, he also represented the United States in international competition and won the gold medal for the United States in the men's junior race at the 1976 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Hulst set multiple California high school records. Running career High school Hulst attended Laguna Beach High School, where he ran cross country and track. Originally, he intended to play tennis, but excelled in his first cross country season and continued from there, running the 2-mile in 9:04.6 (min:sec) as a freshman. At Laguna Beach HS, his coach was Len Miller, who followed a high-mileage coaching philosophy typical of the 1970s and would later coach Hulst at UC-Irvine. Hulst is well-remembered in the running community for his high-risk training regimen. At the age of 15, Hulst logged 100 miles per week of training, and would often get up at 5:00 AM to run between 10 and 13 miles before classes started at 8:30. His morning runs would start from Emerald Bay to Corona del Mar and back, and would frequently wear a 10-pound lead vest. During the course of his high school career, a competitive rivalry ensued between Hulst and Loara High School standout Ralph Serna. At the 1974 National Postal cross country meet, Hulst placed second in a field of the best high school runners in the country, behind only Serna. Dyestat Archive: 1974 17th Annual 2-mile National Postal Results. Retrieved October 27, 2015 Arguably, his most famous high school victory was at the 1975 California Interscholastic Federation state 2-mile championship race, in which he finished in first place in a state high school record time of 8:44.9 ahead of Serna; both finished under Rich Kimball's record 8:46.6 set in the previous year's meet. During his senior year of high school, Hulst was called up to the U.S. national squad for the 1976 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he won the men's junior race. As a result, he appeared in a picture on the cover of the May 1976 issue of Runner's World. Inspired by Dave Wottle, Hulst wore a cap while racing in high school. During that year's track season, he lowered his CIF-SS and state 2-mile record further to 8:44.6 at the CIF-SS Masters Meet and won his second consecutive state championship in the event. Collegiate For a brief time, Hulst attended and ran with UC-Irvine, whose team he helped to win the Division II national cross country championship. He was UC-Irvine's best finisher at the 1976 NCAA DI cross country championships, finishing in 34th overall in the men's 10K race. Athletic.net: NCAA DI Cross Country Championships (Official Results). Retrieved October 27, 2015 However, he developed a chronic knee injury while running at UC-Irvine and eventually dropped out of college in his sophomore year. Post-collegiate After having stopped running collegiately, Hulst made a brief return to competitive racing in California's road racing circuit. After notching multiple road wins, he made his last major race appearance at the 1982 Boston Marathon, where he finished in 28th place in a time of 2:20:23. Death On an unspecified date in February 1991, Hulst was walking out of a movie theater with his mother when he yawned, after which he could not close his mouth due to random muscle contractions. He was immediately taken to the emergency room, where a cancerous tumor the size of a golf ball was discovered in his brain. He subsequently underwent surgery after which 80 percent of a tumor in his brain was removed. A teammate at UC-Irvine and former Corona del Mar distance standout, Brian Hunsaker, had contracted infectious mononucleosis not long before Hulst was diagnosed, and told the Los Angeles Times that he believed the volume of training he and Hulst did had something to do with it. The remainder of the tumor was intentionally left in order to prevent possible brain damage from excessively invasive surgery. From the winter of 1992, Hulst tried alternative cancer treatment at a facility in Mexico, where his doctors saw noticeable improvements and a lessened frequency of seizures. However, the tumor expanded aggressively a second time, and he died on June 21, 1992. Laguna Beach High School's track facility was officially named after Eric Hulst in his honor. Szabo, Matt.

It is found in the Caribbean Sea. It was first described as Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata in 1864 by the American zoologist Addison Emery Verrill. Williams and Chen (2012), transferred all the Atlantic species of Pseudopterogorgia to Antillogorgia. Description Antillogorgia bipinnata is a colonial soft coral growing in the form of a bipinnate fan usually in a single plane. It can grow to a height of about with a slightly smaller width. It consists of a main stem with several branches, with regularly-spaced pairs of branchlets. The branchlets are stiff, slightly flattened, and typically long and in diameter. They are spaced about apart and project at an angle of about 65¬∞ from the branch. The apertures from which the polyps protrude are small and slit-like and are arranged in staggered double rows on either side of the branchlets. The colour of this sea fan is usually violet or purple but may be yellow or whitish. Distribution and habitat Antillogorgia bipinnata is found in shallow water reefs in the Bahamas, South Florida and the Caribbean Sea. It usually grows in the depth range but can grow as deep as . Biology Mature specimens of Antillogorgia bipinnata have symbiotic unicellular algae known as zooxanthellae in their tissues, but these are not present in the planula larvae and the polyp into which it metamorphasizes. Researchers reared these larvae in algae-free environments and then attempted to infect the resulting polyps with various strains of dinoflagellate. Some of these were observed to be attracted to the polyps and actively swam into their open mouths; successful infection was achieved with some strains of dinoflagellate and not with others. Secondary metabolites Several secondary metabolites have been isolated from Antillogorgia bipinnata including the cytotoxic cembranoids denoted bipinnatin A to D, and the diterpene bipinnatin J.

While the term \\"Grievance Redressal\\" primarily covers the receipt and processing of complaints from citizens and consumers, a wider definition includes actions taken on any issue raised by them to avail services more effectively. Overview Grievance Redressal mechanism is mandated in Government agencies and departments that are directly involved with serving citizens and organizations. Usually a Public Relations Officer (PRO) is designated with the role of receiving complaints and initiating corrective action, but this mechanism often fails on account of lack of authority vested in the PRO over officers of various capacities. The Government of India has made effort to systematize the nature of grievance redressal through legislation,\\"The Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of their Grievances Bill, 2011\\" - pplPress Information Bureau, Government of India being driven by civil society agitations under leadership of Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal for enactment of the Jan Lokpal Bill into law.jan Lokpal Bill - as proposed by Aam Aadmi Party Private businesses and Non-Profits engaged in service delivery, such as hotels, restaurants, colleges, etc. often tend to set up their own mechanisms, such as Feedback forms and Contact Us pages. Such means to get direct feedback enable businesses to take corrective action in time. Governments also often accept the responsibility of Consumer protection from private organizations through LegislationConsumer Protection Act, 1986 - Government of India as well as setting up Consumer Courts and Organizations for Dispute Resolution.National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission - Government of India Such consumer courts pursue quick action for redress, while maintaining affordability and ease to the consumer. Coverage Grievance Redressal typically covers the following types of complaints: * Service Unavailability * Non-Delivery against Commitment * Excessive Delays * Injustice concerns (such as over race, caste, sex) * Staff Misbehaviour * Malpractice Wider definition of grievance redressal covers: * Malfunctions under Warranty coverage * Product Support issues * Citizen Vigilance reports * Employee Disputes Process Workflow for Grievance Redressal as handled by sites such as ActPlease.com Organizations define their own process flows for grievance redressal. These are rarely made known to the public in case of private businesses; governments and non-profits usually share voluntarily or by mandate the hierarchy of officers responsible for taking corrective action. Some organizations maintain a custom-developed ticketing software, while others count on SaaS Portals such as ActPlease.com. Feedback Portals such as TripAdvisor and Yelp are driven by consumers, and organizations / businesses have the option to join and participate. Depending on the desire to correct as well as level of transparency of the organization, grievance redressal flow can include the following steps: Input acceptance Customers convey their grievance to the organization through feedback forms, letters, registered communications, emails, etc. These inputs may be submitted by mail, over the Internet, or in person. Anonymity Customers are often reluctant to report grievances that target individual executives of the organization, especially those who may influence their future interactions or have the potential to take vengeance. Under such conditions, the organization needs to assure the customer that her identity will be hidden from executives, and preferably from everyone. This, however, opens the potential problem of deceitful negative inputs purposefully targeted against specific executives, as the people reporting are kept anonymous. Feedback forms on website are prone to spam submissions. There are cases when employees themselves submit feedback - positive for their professional gain, and negative if targeting colleagues. Some service centers make employees sign blank feedback forms to create positive statistics. Such situations can be prevented by seeking verification of identity of customers. This is especially possible on online setups, such as ActPlease.com, which uses SMS to verify the authenticity of the mobile number of reporter. Basic tools such as Captcha can prevent automatic spammers. Mass submission of false feedback becomes less likely and easy to detect in case of paper-based submission. Acknowledgement & Status Tracking Customers tend to develop much greater confidence in the grievance and feedback mechanism if they are given a formal acknowledgement. The acknowledgement could be by SMS and Email, as used by ActPlease.com, or simply by publicly posting their message on the appropriate forum, such as TripAdvisor. Ticketing Systems such as osTicket and Fresh Desk, as well as SaaS systems such as ActPlease respond with acknowledgements with unique tracking numbers. These may be used by customers to check the status of action taken on their complaint. Forwarding Paper-based feedback as well as standard feedback forms on websites usually forward inputs to a single officer or email address. This naturally causes scope for delay or failure to reach the right persons. However, smarter ticketing systems sort grievances based on their classification, and then redirect each to their relevant executive(s) instantly. Escalation Smart Grievance Portals such as ActPlease expect organizations to configure typical action time for each type of complaint, as well as set up the hierarchy for escalation. When an executive fails to take corrective action in time, the matter is promoted to the officer next in line in seniority. Action Computerized and web-based systems have an advantage over paper-based systems as they can alert the reporter immediately upon completion of action, as marked by the executive in charge. Verification Customer may certify, if applicable and asked, whether the corrective action taken on their grievance satisfies them or is not substantial enough. Should it not be, the complaint may be marked as pending again, or be forwarded to a more senior officer in escalated form. Measurements The effectiveness of implementation of a grievance redressal mechanism can be calculated with the following parameters: * Count of cases received * Nature of cases received * Acceptance of anonymous feedback * Ratio of false inputs * Time taken for corrective action * Escalations required * Confirmations & rejections after completion * Repeat nature of grievances Challenges Traditional Grievance Redressal mechanisms tend to fail, or are very ineffective, on account of some of these causes: * Unavailability or Difficulty to access means to report grievances, at times done so purposefully, or due to lack of priority * Lack of authority of PRO over relevant departments and executives in Government organizations * Disconnect of senior decision-maker executives with end customers * Non-motivation of front-end managers to forward negative feedback to higher-ups * Fear of citizens / consumers to report malpractice about officers with substantial authority * Inability of smaller private organizations to set up computerized mechanisms * Inaccuracy and spamming of feedback forms, driving false impressions * Delayed feedback acceptance, as feedback is taken after service has been provided, while corrective action may be taken typically during the delivery of service Grievance Redressal Options available to Organizations Paper-based Feedback Forms These are most popular and usually used by consumer service businesses, such as hotels and restaurants. They are less likely to be effective, as there is reduced assurance of their reaching the decision-making authorities. These also usually do not give any formal confirmation or tracking number to the complainant. Possibility of fake submissions also remains. Customers therefore have less confidence on such forms. Confidence can be strengthened if a central call center sends an acknowledgement of receipt of such feedback. Another possible reinforcement may be done by taking digitized input, which can be processed using scantron machines. Contact Us Links Websites of organizations generally carry the Contact Us page, which lists the email and phone numbers to use to submit any concerns. Many websites also provide a form to fill that automatically gets sent by email, with confirmation to the reporter. Customer-driven Feedback Websites Websites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor allow customers to post grievances and recommendations about organizations from personal experience. Designated representatives of these organizations have the option to respond to such communications, though these responses are often just standard text. The feedback also tends to be subjective and unlikely to be auto-sorted and forwarded for action. Organization-oriented Portals Organizations can subscribe to grievance redressal portals such as ActPlease.com to invite their customers to report their grievances and request action. As such portals are configured by the organizations themselves, they can ensure that complaints are directed properly. ActPlease, being a third party site, handles anonymity of the reporter from the organization when necessary, while ensuring the genuine nature of the person, through SMS verification. Such SaaS Portals are easy to use and easily affordable for all organizations including SMEs, while empowering them with the latest tools such as Mobile a/c number 60332595050 ko10pm 2000 bank me fas hai adhar card number 644451794526 and Customized Websites. Custom-developed Ticketing Systems Large organizations involved in customer service set up their own ticketing systems with similar features as the SaaS portals, but with greater customization in the processing of grievances. Examples of such organizations are Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Torrent Power. Large-scale ERP software, such as SAP and Genie also provide facility for setting up ticketed grievance redressal and customer support systems.

It was directed by executive producer Cary Joji Fukunaga and written by series creator Nic Pizzolatto. The episode introduces a pair of Louisiana State Police homicide detectives, Rustin \\"Rust\\" Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin \\"Marty\\" Hart (Woody Harrelson), as well as series regulars played by Michelle Monaghan, Michael Potts, and Tory Kittles. In \\"The Long Bright Dark\\", Martin and Rustin are forced to recount the history of the Dora Lange murder investigation as new evidence suggests the perpetrator remains at large. Pizzolatto began writing True Detective as a novel, but, as the project began taking definite form, felt it was more suitable for television. Principal photography was initially scheduled to take place in Arkansas; however, Louisiana was ultimately preferred for its generous statewide tax incentives and unique landscape. \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" was shot entirely in 35 mm film and filming for the season lasted for 100 consecutive days. Most press reviews for \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" were very positive, although some reviewers criticized the dialogue and other aspects of the program. Critics that held the episode in high regard applauded its complex narrative and sleek production, and there was a surfeit of praise for the performances of McConaughey and Harrelson. The initial broadcast of \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" drew 2.3 million viewers, becoming HBO's highest rated series premiere since the pilot episode of Boardwalk Empire. Plot 2012 The episode opens with Martin \\"Marty\\" Hart (Woody Harrelson), a former homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division, beginning an interview with detectives Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles). His former partner, Detective Rustin \\"Rust\\" Cohle (Matthew McConaughey), is being questioned separately; they have neither spoken to nor seen each other since an altercation over a decade ago. The two men are asked to recount their relationship and the history of the Dora Lange murder investigation of 1995, the files of which were destroyed in Hurricane Rita. Hart and Cohle claim to have apprehended the killer, but the crime scene of a recently slain woman is found to closely mirror the Dora Lange murder scene, leading investigators to believe that the perpetrator is still at large. 1995 Hart and Cohle are summoned to Vermillion Parish to examine the murder scene of a young prostitute. The woman's corpse, crowned with deer antlers and bound to a tree in a kneeling position, is surrounded by numerous twig latticeworks loosely resembling Cajun bird traps. Cohle notices several stab wounds and ligature marks scattered about on the corpse, suspecting the victim to be the centerpiece of a ritual murder ‚Äì the \\"paraphiliac love map\\" to the perpetrator's fantasy. Hart dismisses his suspicions, and suddenly invites Cohle to dinner at his wife Maggie's (Michelle Monaghan) insistence, much to Cohle's dismay as it is his deceased daughter's birthday. However, he reluctantly agrees to come, but infuriates Hart when he shows up intoxicated. Meanwhile, Major Ken Quesada (Kevin Dunn) immediately sets up a press conference and assigns Hart responsibility over the briefing session for the following day. Cohle continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes ‚Äì Anette (Charleigh Harmon) and Lucy (Alyshia Ochse) ‚Äì about any disappearances, but to no avail. By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: the body had been successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Hart, Cohle and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence. The duo visit Dora's ex-husband Charlie Lange (Brad Carter) in prison for questioning. Charlie, incarcerated on charges of check fraud, claims to have not seen the woman since she filed for divorce a year into his prison sentence. He informs the detectives of Dora's risky drug habits as well as the details of his final phone conversation with her. The investigation takes a brief detour as Hart and Cohle direct their attention to a five-year-old missing-persons case, a little girl named Marie Fontenot, after she was mentioned by one of the locals. Authorities believe she is in the care of her father, and during a visit to see her uncle Danny Fontenot (Christopher Berry), his caretaker echoed their beliefs. Cohle searches the property for potential evidence, and while in a shed, stumbles upon a twig sculpture eerily similar to those discovered at the Dora Lange murder scene. Production Development \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga. An accomplished writer, series creator Nic Pizzolatto delved into fiction writing and published a novel, titled Galveston (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC's The Killing the following year. It was around this time that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television, an endeavor that, due to a lack of capital, was never fully realized. He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel, but later, once the project took definite form, felt it was more suitable on screen. \\"I'd always had plans from the first time I'd talked to an agent from Hollywood, I was going to ask how you break into this business, and particularly cable-TV writing, because in television the writer stays in control, which is what the concept of show runner is\\", he remembers. Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives, and from May to July 2010, he drafted six screenplays, including a spec script for \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" which consumed 90 pages. Shortly thereafter, he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series. Pizzolatto's stint with The Killing provided him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry, but grew increasingly dissatisfied with the show's creative direction, eventually leaving the writing staff two weeks into the program's second season. \\"I want to be the guiding vision. I don't do well serving someone else's vision. I'm not at my best there, and I don't think I‚Äôm worth as much to the people who pay me.\\" He soon directed his attention to working on another script for the True Detective project, encouraged by Anonymous Content. Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu was initially expected to be appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him to pull out of the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop \\"a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana‚Äîespecially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier‚ÄîI've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters.\\" Casting McConaughey and Harrelson were among a small pool of actors considered suitable candidates for top billing. Producers contracted McConaughey, who had recently finished filming Killer Joe (2011), well before True Detective was greenlit by HBO. Pizzolatto, impressed with the actor's performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), originally assigned him the role of Martin Hart, but McConaughey offered \\"a really compelling argument\\" for portraying Rustin \\"Rust\\" Cohle. When asked about his decision to switch parts in a Variety interview, McConaughey replied: \\"I wanted to get in that dude‚Äôs head. The obsession, the island of a man‚ÄîI‚Äôm always looking for a guy who monologues. It‚Äôs something really important as I feel I‚Äôm going into my better work.\\" To prepare, the actor studied his character through what he described the \\"Four Stages of Rustin Cohle\\", a 450-page document he created detailing Rustin's evolution over the course of the story. Meanwhile, Harrelson was attached to the role of Martin under McConaughey's recommendation. Having previously starred in the HBO film Game Change (2012), Harrelson gravitated to the project due in part to his colleagues; \\"I love Matthew. He's my brother. He's a phenomenal, amazing person. And I love Michelle [Monaghan]. I've known her many, many years. Cary [Fukunaga] is a terrific director. And Nic [Pizzolatto] wrote this phenomenal script that you just couldn‚Äôt put down. His writing is so amazing.\\" Monaghan was chosen to play the female lead, Martin Hart's wife Maggie; the actress took an interest in True Detective as she realized her character arc and \\"really saw where these characters went.\\" Potts acted as Detective Maynard Gilbough, and Kittles played his partner Detective Thomas Papania. Filming The initial location for principal photography for True Detective was Arkansas; however, Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern Louisiana to capitalize on generous statewide tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape, which he felt illustrated a striking paradox. \\"There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all,\\" the native Louisianan noted. \\"Everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance.\\" \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" and subsequent episodes were shot in 35 mm film, and principal photography for the season consumed 100 consecutive days. The crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside of Erath, Louisiana which, because it was partially burned, inspired a \\"moody and atmospheric\\" backdrop for corresponding scenes. Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw, previously director of photography for Top of the Lake, as project cinematographer and employed minimalistic lighting for layering composition. Also involved in production was Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had previously worked with on Benh Zeitlin Glory at Sea (2008). The director remarked in an interview, \\"I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again.\\" Reception Ratings In its initial American broadcast, \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" was seen by an estimated 2.3 million viewers. It was the highest rated series premiere out of any HBO program in the last four years, falling behind only the series premiere of Boardwalk Empire, which drew 4.8 million viewers. The episode performed exceptionally well with adults between the ages of 18 and 49, recording a 1.0 rating in that demographic. \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" was the fifth highest rated cable telecast of the night by total viewership. The United Kingdom terrestrial premiere was broadcast on February 22, 2014 by Sky Atlantic, garnering 707,000 viewers. Critical response \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" was critically acclaimed by most critics. Tim Goodman from The Hollywood Reporter said Fukunaga develops \\"a beautiful, sprawling sense of place\\" in the premiere, and identified the ensemble and the writing, which he believed \\"undulates from effectively brash soliloquies to penetratingly nuanced moments carried by sparse prose\\", as two of its other most satisfying attributes. Marshall Crook of The Wall Street Journal agreed, writing the show hits the mark with \\"good acting, smart writing, and lush cinematography\\". Willa Paskin of Slate described the episode as \\"creepy, gorgeous, unsettling, and searching\\" and noticed \\"a literary quality, an accretion of meaningful detail\\" within the show's narrative. The Daily Beast Andrew Romano said the premiere, together with the former half of the season, compose \\"one of the most riveting and provocative series I've ever seen\\", while Entertainment Weekly critic Jeff Jensen called it \\"an enthralling murder mystery about history, culture, and heroic character\\". Brian Lowry, reviewing for Variety, called \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" a \\"rich and absorbing\\" episode where True Detective immediately assumes a unique identity from other police procedurals, and wrote the cast ensemble consisted of \\"fine players on the periphery\\". Writing in USA Today, Robert Bianco felt McConaughey and Harrelson not only met, but occasionally even exceeded \\"enormously high\\" performance expectations of the \\"golden age of TV acting\\". David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle singled out the duo as being \\"in a class of their own\\", and Los Angeles Times journalist Robert Lloyd thought the character work from the two men was of \\"a very high order\\". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, though found the program's grim tone to be occasionally excessive, opined that the two men successfully engaged audiences enough to invest in the series with their performances. Monaghan also received kudos from Rodman for her work in the episode. Additional praise for ensemble performances, chiefly for McConaughey and Harrelson, came from Time James Poniewozik, The New York Times critic Mike Hale, Curt Wagner in RedEye, The Independent Sarah Hughes, and Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian. Bianco said the show avoided character stereotypes, and Alan Sepinwall in HitFix felt Cohle and Hart developed into such riveting characters \\"that they paper over some of the series' weaknesses\\". The Daily Telegraph critic Chris Harvey awarded \\"The Long Bright Dark\\" five out of five stars, hailing True Detective as \\"the most ambitious TV drama for a long time\\". Not all critics were as enthusiastic in their reviews of \\"The Long Bright Dark\\". Hale, despite commending the flashback narrative, believed the dialogue devolved into \\"a languid character study and a vehicle for long-winded exchanges about religion and responsibility that are writerly in the worst way.\\" Chris Cabin from Slant Magazine agreed that the writing too readily \\"defers to an earnest, rote view of bad religion\\", but wrote that Pizzolatto and Fukunaga \\"smartly embrace the pulpiness of their material\\".

He was appointed consul twice: the first time in 110 CE (as consul suffectus) with Gaius Erucianus Silo as his colleague; the second in the year 120 (as consul ordinarius) with the future emperor Antoninus Pius as his colleague. Catilius was also the step-great-grandfather of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Catilius is called Lucius Catilius Severus Julianus in Bithynian inscriptions, Lucius Catilius Severus as a consul, and Catilius Severus in literary sources.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 138 His family origins probably lie in Apamea, a town of Bithynia. In his monograph of naming practices in the first centuries of the Roman Empire, Olli Salomies notes that this polyonymous name implies an adoption, \\"no doubt the son of a Cn. Catilius, not the son of a Cn. Claudius adopted by a L. Catilius, in spite of the existence of senatorial Cn. Claudii Severi from Asia Minor.\\"  Career  The cursus honorum of Catilius Severus is preserved in an inscription recovered from Antium. His earliest recorded office was the first of the traditional republican magistracies, quaestor, which enabled him to be enrolled as a member of the Senate; in his case, he was assigned as quaestor to the province of Asia. He advanced to the traditional Roman magistracy of plebeian tribune; the fact he was praetor is omitted from this inscription, but must be presumed because it was required for the following offices Catilius is recorded as holding. Normally a senator destined for the consulate would hold only two offices, command of a legion and governorship of a province or prefect of one of the aerarii or treasuries: Catilius held six of these. First in the list was prefectus frumenti dandi (or Prefect responsible for the distribution of Rome‚Äôs free grain dole), next was legatus or assistant to the proconsular governor of Asia, then curator of an unnamed road, legatus or commander of Legio XXII Primigenia, and lastly prefect of each of the treasuries, aerarium militare in the years 105 to 107, then the aerarium Saturni in 108 to 110.Mireille Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare. Administration et prosopographie s√©natoriale, (Rome: √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1974) (Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 24), pp. 144-156 At this point Catilius entered his first consulate. Following his term as suffect consul, Catilius was admitted to the Septemviri epulonum, one of the four most prestigious collegia of ancient Roman priests. In 114 he was appointed governor of Cappadocia-Armenia.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 357-362 During his tenure, Catilius participated in Trajan's campaign against the Parthian empire, and received a number of dona militaria or military decorations. In the Fall of 117, following the death of Trajan, his heir Hadrian appointed Catilius to replace him as governor of Syria so Hadrian could return to Rome. Catilius remained as governor of Syria until 119.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 148-151 After his second consulate in 120,Werner Eck and Andreas Pangerl, \\"Ein Consul Suffectus Q. Aburnius in drei fragmentarischen Diplomen\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 185 (2013), pp. 239‚Äì247 Catilius held the proconsular governorship of Africa in 124/125,Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\" (1983), p. 160 then was prefect of Rome. To hold just one of these offices was considered the apex of a successful senatorial career; holding two of them proves not only his success but his favor with Hadrian.  Family  Catilius is believed to have been the third husband of Dasumia Polla, the widow of Gnaeus Domitius Tullus; Tullus had adopted his niece Domitia Lucilla the Elder, who would become the grandmother of the later Emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose upbringing he influenced. Marcus Aurelius later recalled Catilius Severus' influence in his life as preventing him from attending \\"public places of teaching but to have enjoyed good teachers at home, and to have learned that it is a duty to spend liberally on such things.\\"Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, cited in Anthony Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, revised edition (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 36 Two Gnaei Catilii Severi, attested as members of the Arval Brethren in 183 and 213 to 218, were doubtlessly the descendants of Catilius, or at the least from his family.

He was a gifted warrior and widely regarded as one of the greatest generals of Sri Lankan history. Well known for his prowess of warfare, he was the central figure of the Kotte army, in a series of relentless wars against King Mayadunne of Sitawaka and occasionally, against the Portuguese. Being impetuous by nature, he got himself involved in many scandals, including the murder of his wife, Samudra Deviya (‡∑É‡∂∏‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª ‡∂Ø‡∑ö‡∑Ä‡∑í), the daughter of his king. Background At the time of his birth and during his youth in early 16th century, several parties were struggling for the supremacy of the island of Sri Lanka. Chief among them were King Bhuvanekabahu VII, his younger brother Mayadunne, the ruler of Sithawaka and the Portuguese, who were starting to establish themselves along the western coast of Sri Lanka. In addition, the central and northern parts of the island were also governed by regional rulers. Birth Veediya Bandara was born to a family of nobility. His father was a local lord of royal descent called Kumara Bandara (‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑è‡∂ª ‡∂∂‡∂´‡∑ä‡∂©‡∑è‡∂ª) who ruled ,Kalutara to Maggona. Prince Raigam Bandara ( Elder Brother to Mayadunne and younger brother to Bhuvanekabahu) took Most of all Kalutara after the Mutant ( Vijayabaa Kollaya) against his own father . and his mother was a cousin of King Bhuvanekabahu. From a very early age, he had access to the royal courts and there, he and the king's daughter, Samudra Deviya, were said to have developed a deep affection towards each other, that would later trigger a catastrophic chain of events. Marriage Despite of his noble birth and unparallelled skills at arms, king Bhuvanekabahu did not approve the union of Veediya Bandara and his daughter. Instead, he preferred another price called \\"Jayo Bandara\\" to take the hand of his daughter. Jayo Bandara was also a chivalrous youth of noble birth, whom the king regarded as the son he never had. Outraged by the notion of losing his love, Veediya Bandara went on to challenge Jayo Bandara to a dual for her hand. Although an accomplished fighter himself, Jayo Bandara was no match for the brute strength and the skill of Veediya Bandara. The dual ended up in the defeat and death of Jayo Bandara and it wasn't long before Veediya Bandara realizing the enormity of his actions and fled Kotte. Without both the princes the royal army was leaderless and with the threat of his brother Mayadunne looming, king Bhuvanekabahu had no option but to pardon Veediya Bandara, appoint him as the leader of the army and wed him to his daughter. Even though their marriage produced a son named Dharmapala in 1541, it did not prove to be a long lasting one. While Veediya Bandara was away crushing a rebellion, a rumor was spread involving Samudra Deviya and a Portuguese officer at the royal court. While several sources suggest that there was little substance to the rumor, the complete truth remains unknown. The truth of the matter, however, did not concern Veediya Bandara. His was an honour of unbendable kind as he deemed the damage done was beyond repair. He took his wife to a walk on the banks of Diyawanna lake and in a moment of madness, confessed his intentions to take her life for her alleged crime. According to legend he wept at the water's edge, as the lifeless body of his loving wife, one of the renowned beauties of her time, was floating on the lake. Military campaigns Veediya Bandara and his Deputy Commanders Vijayakoon Mudaliya who was the ‚Äòbangai-rala‚Äô, better known as Vijayakumara, Velayuda Arachchi, Bodhiraja Perumal of Hiti-Imbula and Varusapperuma Arachchi & Personal Maggona Arachchi ,Commander of Personal Bodyguards to the Veediya Bandara (Sworn to Protect Veediya Bandara & His Family by the Birth) .led the army of Kotte to victory in numerous battles against king Mayadunne and later against his son, Rajasinha I. Once, in the early stages of this rivalry, he annihilated the army of Sithawaka that was strengthened by an alliance with a South Indian state. After the battle, he laid waste to Sithawaka and put the royal palace to torch. And when Mayadunne sued for peace, King Bhuvanekabahu, upon Veediya Bandara's insistence, demanded the heads of the two South Indian commanders who had dared to invade Kotte. Veediya Bandara had to put down many rebellions in various parts of the country that kept him constantly out of the capital. He often made short work of them, yet, this situation presented his greater enemies with an opportunity. Knowing Veediya Bandara's absence, Mayadunne prepared to attack Kotte with the ruler of Kandy as his ally. When the words reached Veediya Bandara in Uva, he made haste and descended upon the army of Kandy before it joined forces with Mayadunne. Afterwards, his army invaded and captured Sithawaka again as Mayadunne fled without a fight. This, however, was a ruse. Secretly deployed forces attacked Veediya Bandara's men and took them by complete surprise. Unprepared and outnumbered, they endured a heavy defeat for the misjudgment of their leader. Veediya Bandara himself, retreated with several of his guards only to be betrayed by them as there was a hefty price on his head while Velayuda Arachchi fighting alone with enemies for make time to fall back his Master and Friends of Commanders . It is said that they were 50 men's of Kotte Army fighting Veediya Bandara for get hefty price and Maggona Arachchi fight till his death to protect his master ( Veediya Bandara) , when Tikiri Bandara Rajasinha, son of Mayadunne arrived there with a force. Rather than facing certain death, Veediya Bandara ordered Vijayakoon Mudaliya, Bodhiraja Perumal of Hiti-Imbula and Varusapperuma Arachchi to flee to Kotte and wait for his Orders but they refuse and then Veediya Bandara was angry and re - ordered to fall back and carry the Death Body of his loyal commander of Personal Bodyguard , Maggona Arachchi ( he was the childhood friend to Veediya Bandara) and then decided to surrender to price Rajasinha who in time, distinguished himself as a worrier king. After his capture, Veediya Bandara was imprisoned in Sithawaka for some time, though, he was able to escape from his prison miraculously, and found his way back to Kotte. Sources claim that Veediya Bandara was aided in his escape by Suriya Deviya, the daughter of Mayadunne, whom had fallen in love with him. Soon after, he saw to it that the debt was paid, when he took Suriya Deviya as his new bride. After the tragic death of king Bhuvanaikabahu VII, his grandson (and the son of Veediya Bandara's first marriage), Dharmapala, ascended the throne of Kotte. As his regent, Veediya Bandara assumed the governance of the kingdom. Being an opponent of the Portuguese from the start, he decided to prevent the expansion of Christianity in Kotte. This, along with several other matters, caused his relationship with the Portuguese to decline (which was not a promising one at any stage) to a point that saw him arrested and taken prisoner by the colonialists. He was held inside the fort of Colombo to be taken away for a trial in Goa, when his wife rescued him again by having a tunnel dug underneath the walls of the fort.

J. Douglas, that discusses the politics and historical details of Chinese Canadians in British Columbia from 1858 until the early 1970s. In particular, the book addresses the non- Chinese British Columbia community's belief that the Chinese were a \\"problem\\" that needed to be dealt with.Worden, p. 347. William Willmott, of the University of Canterbury, wrote that \\"it is evident from the nature of his source material that Dr. Morton did not set out to write a book about the Chinese in British Columbia, but only about white reactions to them.\\"Willmott, p. 136. \\"Historians will remain indebted to Dr. Morton for this labour of love, but its usefulness to them is sadly and unnecessarily marred by the lack of any scholarly apparatus whatsoever.\\" Background The title of the book originates from a comment towards the province in an 1874 speech by Edward Blake, a member of the Parliament of Canada from South Bruce, Ontario. He called British Columbia \\"an inhospitable country, a sea of sterile mountains.\\"Willmott, p. 135. \\"Such meticulous scholarship, which must have involved long hours of diligent searching through the entire file of several newspapers, is work for an historian, and Dr. Morton will be the first to admit he is not one.\\" The book uses six documentaries and secondary sources total. The book uses extracts from two Royal Commission reports, as well as newspaper articles and editorials, particularly those of Canadian newspapers,Worden, p. 348. spanning over 100 years. Newspapers represented include the British Columbian, Cariboo Sentinel, Colonist (Victoria),Morton, p. 149. Gazette, Guardian (New Westminster),Morton, p. 152. Herald, News (Vancouver),Morton, p. 146. and the News Advertiser (Vancouver).Morton, p. 180. While James Morton is not a historian,Willmott, p. 135. \\"Such meticulous scholarship, which must have involved long hours of diligent searching through the entire file of several newspapers, is work for an historian, and Dr. Morton will be the first to admit he is not one.\\" Willmott described the collection of newspapers as a \\"labour of love,\\" and \\"meticulous scholarship.\\" Samantha J. Scott, the author of Text as Discourse: The Chinese in Canada in Historiographical Perspective, argued, \\"Morton relies at random upon a very minute selection of newspaper articles and government records.\\"Scott, p. 75 Contents The book includes 10 chapters, an index,Willmott, p. 137. sixteen pages of black-and-white photographs in two sets,Beardsley, p. 23. and a listing of key dates from 1843‚Äì1967, labeled \\"chronology.\\" The dust jacket has three colours. Willmott stated that the chronology is \\"useful\\" and that the book overall is \\"well presented\\". Doug Beardsley of Books in Canada wrote that there are too few photographs in the book, but that overall the \\"beautifully produced\\" book is \\"handsome.\\" Each chapter is about an aspect of the British Columbian perception of the Chinese people, and the chapters are arranged in a chronological manner. Willmott characterized the organization as \\"arbitrary.\\" The book discusses the origins of anti-East Asian sentiment stemming from the Opium War-era relations with China and the reasons for Chinese immigration to North America.Beardsley, p. 21, 23. Morton criticized Sir Wilfrid Laurier's preferential treatment of Japanese persons. Beardsley wrote \\"Morton is not afraid to pinpoint those most responsible for fanning the flames of prejudice.\\" The book does not have footnotes. The book has few notes of exact sources of materials, and the book does not have a list of newspapers and dates. Scott criticized the lack of footnotes, saying that there was \\"little accountability\\" with them. The book has five titles in its \\"Sources Other Than Newspapers\\" list; Willmott characterized two of them as being \\"trivial\\". Willmott argued that the overall lack of sourcing information decreases the amount of usefulness in this book for historians. The author argued that the anti-Chinese campaigners in the 19th century would have had different opinions if they had lived in another era, and that using mid-20th century standards to judge the 19th century campaigners is not fair. Morton added that his book is \\"not a necessarily sociological history of the Chinese in the sea of sterile mountains nor, for that matter, a particularly accurate or complete one.\\"Scott, p. 76. Includes a portion of the quote.Morton, p. viii. Includes the entire quote. Reception Beardsley stated \\"Morton has documented it well by means of the newspapers of the time.\\" Willmott wrote that the book \\"sorely\\" lacked \\"scholarly judgment\\" and that it is \\"disappointingly limited\\" in terms of being a reference book. Robert L. Worden, the author of a book review written for The Journal of Asian Studies, wrote that despite some issues with methodology and minor errors, \\"Morton's book is a good presentation of how British Columbians reacted to the Chinese\\". In regards to the methodology Worden argued that the first half of the book was \\"objective\\" and \\"reasonably well-documented\\" but that by the second half the author \\"seems to have been influenced by the same nine-teenth-century standards he weakly tries to justify\\". Worden also criticized the lack of \\"adequate expression of the Chinese view of their outcast position\\" by saying that it relied too much on Canadian newspaper articles. Scott criticized the lack of footnotes, the sourcing methodology, \\"explicit dialogue with previous texts,\\" and the sourcing itself; Scott asserted that therefore \\"the conclusions drawn consequently appear unreliable.\\" Scott stated that the book's efforts to get \\"an international scope through loose connections between British Columbia, California and Australia\\" were positive and that Morton \\"tries to recognize the shortcomings of his own text\\". She concluded that \\"Although this text is outdated in many respects, the fact that it confronts discrimination toward the Chinese is testimony to an increasingly liberal climate of opinion.\\" See also * A White Man's Province References * Beardsley, Doug. \\"Chicken Chow Mean\\" (book review of In the Sea of Sterile Mountains).

Juan de Mal Lara (Sevilla, 1524 ‚Äì Sevilla, 1571) was a Spanish humanist, poet, playwright and paremiologue at the University of Seville during the period of the Spanish Renaissance in the reign of Philip II of Spain. Biography Mal Lara studied Latin and Greek grammar at the College of San Miguel in Sevilla. His teacher was Pedro Fernandez de Castilleja and later Mal Lara taught humanities to Mateo Alem√°n. It was a decade later, after studying at the University of Salamanca, where he was student of Hern√°n N√∫√±ez one of classmates was Francisco S√°nchez de las Brozas, known as the \\"Brocense\\"; later he went to Valencia and Barcelona, where he completed his studies with Francisco Escobar before returning again to Salamanca. In 1548 he returned to Seville to study Arts. By 1550 he taught at humanities and literature in a grammar school in Sevilla. In 1565, the Count of Gelves in Seville, established his \\"Merlin's Garden\\" in the fields near Tablada, and this became a regular gathering of an academic circle which also included Baltasar del Alc√°zar, Francisco Pacheco, Juan de la Cueva Christopher Mosquera de Figueroa, Crist√≥bal de Mesa, Francisco Medina and Fernando de Herrera, which group later were known as the Sevillian Poetry School. Mal Lara was investigated by the Spanish Inquisition in 1561, but was cleared of all charges in 1566, the year he moved to Madrid to join the royal court of king Philip II of Spain. Philip of Spain also claimed to be king of England and Ireland following his marriage to Mary I of England was known as 'the prudent' since despite several financial crisis was an intelligent ruler and dedicated philosophical scholar who particularly studied the work of the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero which is why in modern Spanish a serious but informal discussion is called \\"una tertulia\\" Within this intensive royal court Mal Laura composed verses to accompany or embellish certain paintings by Titian and was commissioned to create allegorical motif for the flagship of Don Juan de Austria, which included writing an elaborate description of \\"the royal galley of Serene Don Juan de Austria, Captain of all the Seas\\". He married to Maria de Ojeda with whom he had two daughters, Gila and Silvestra. He also worked with scholars and historians as important as Gonzalo Argote de Molina. He is credited, although this is widely disputed, with the invention of the structure of the ten-line stanza known as a D√©cima popularized Vicente Espinel, in whose honor the d√©cima is also known as a \\"Spinel\\". An unpublished biography of Mal Lara is preserved in the Municipal Archives of Seville. Works In his lifetime he was mostly known for two works: Philosophia vulgar (Seville, 1568), the first part of which contains one thousand and one refrains: pithy sayings or proverbs to be learned by heart, in which preliminary discourse extols the wisdom embedded in ancient sayings, although this work sometimes follows the Adagia of Erasmus of Rotterdam and other similar classical writers. The other major work was a tribute that Mal Lara wrote with Alonso Escribano for Rey Phelipe de Seuilla (Philip II Spain and thus also of Seville), to deliver in 1570 extolling the virtues of the very noble and loyal city of Seuilla in gratitude for the warm welcome received by Philip. Mal Lara also described the lavish decoration of the walls of Seville with figures and allegorical verses representing the various divisions within the Seville jurisdiction. The book was published after the victory of the monarch against the Moorish rebellion of Alpujarras. Psyche, a mythological poem in Hendecasyllable style was not well received at the time. It was inspired Psyche and Cupid included in The Golden Ass a novel of Apuleius. His fifth book was published by Mario Gasparini at the Trilingual University College of Salamanca in 1947. He also composed eclogues Narciso and Laurea, Annotations to the syntax of Erasmus, a philosophical dissertation Pilgrimage of life, as well as Principles of Grammar, guidance Notes on Emblems of Andrea Alciato, the Scholia of Rhetoric on the introductions of Aphthonius of Antioch, Chronicle of the Holy Apostles, a poem in octaves The Death of Orpheus and a Latin poem The Martyrdom of Saints Justa and Rufina, patron of Seville . Some of his dramatic works are noteworthy, including the tragedy Absalom and the comedy Locusta, first performed at the University of Salamanca in 1548 both in Latin and Castilian languages; he continued this dramatic activity in Seville, where he composed the comedy In praise of Our Lady of Consolation performed by his students in Utrera in 1561. A probable work entitled Tragedy of San Hermenegildo is lost. Juan de la Cueva, in his Poetic Exemplar places Mal Lara him among the classical playwrights in the Aristotelian tradition, although with some reservations. The Spirited Hercules is an erudite poetic work formerly believed lost but subsequently rediscovered via a copy within the Ajuda National Palace in Portugal. It was highly praised by his contemporaries and contains details about the Seville group and Chansonnier lyrics that deserve careful study. It is written in stanzas and divided into twelve books, each with four songs. It is dedicated to Prince Carlos with the intention to glorify twelve victories of his grandfather, alluded to allegorically within the main theme of the poem, by singing the praises of the mythological feats of the twelve labors of Hercules. Thus, the Nemean lion symbolizes the Revolt of the Comuneros, the Erymanthian Boar is Francis I of France, etc. The poem ends with the vision of king Philip II as Theseus,essentially a new Hercules to relieve Atlas. Mal Lara started this work in 1549, but he died suddenly and so was unable to deliver the manuscript to the printer. The surviving poems of Mal Lara may be found in Volume XLII of the Biblioteca de Autores Espa√±oles; his complete works were published in three volumes by Manuel Bernal Rodr√≠guez in 1996, within the Castro Library.

It is part of the Cycle Superhighway network coordinated by TfL, running from Barking in the east to Lancaster Gate in central London. It is part of the East-West Cycle Superhighway and is a popular route with both commuter and leisure cyclists, passing a number of major destinations in London en route. For almost the entire route, cyclists are separated from other traffic in segregated cycle lanes, and cycling infrastructure has been provided at major interchanges.  Route  CS3 begins in Barking and ends at Lancaster Gate in the City of Westminster.  Barking to Leamouth  CS3 begins to the south of Greatfields Park, Barking at the intersection between River Road and the A13 (Alfred's Way). The beginning of the Superhighway can be found at the southern side of the junction as a narrow, two-way cycle track signed \\"Cycle Superhighway (CS3)\\" towards Canning Town (25 mins), Canary Wharf (35 mins) and Tower Gateway (55 mins). The journey times are signposted and calculated by TfL. The cycle track is coloured blue. Heading westbound, the blue cycle track is intermittent, sharing its space with the pedestrian footpath. This continues for around 500 metres before the blue, two-way track returns as a constant feature running in parallel with the A13, separated from the main carriageway by a kerb. CS3 and the A13 cross the Barking Creek alongside one another, at the same time crossing from Barking and Dagenham into Newham. After crossing Barking Creek, CS3 branches southwards so as to avoid clashing with traffic at the busy junction between the A13, the A406/North Circular and A1020. Having passed beneath the A1020/Royal Docks Road, CS3 continues to run parallel to the A13 (Newham Way), segregated from traffic on the main carriageway. On this section, the Superhighway passes through Beckton, where there is a short cycle link southwards towards Beckton DLR station, and then to the east of Canning Town station, before running in parallel to the A13 once more to cross Bow Creek. The entirety of this section through Newham is shared with route 13 of the 1980s-era London Cycle Network.  Leamouth to Tower Gateway  To the west of Bow Creek, CS3 enters Tower Hamlets and heads south of East India Dock Road (A13) into Leamouth on the western pavement of Leamouth Road. Still signposted but no longer a blue cycle track, CS3 then heads westbound on Sorrel Lane, southbound on Oregano Drive, then westbound on Saffron Avenue. Cyclists share road space with other traffic in this more residential area. CS3 passes through Poplar, just north of Canary Wharf, sharing Poplar High Street with other road traffic. At the western end of Poplar High Street, the Superhighway continues along Ming Street and Premiere Place, passing Westferry DLR station to the north. Continuing westbound, CS3 follows Limehouse Causeway and Narrow Street, briefly running parallel to the River Thames. Still signposted, CS3 then heads roughly north, joining Cable Street at its eastern terminus. On Cable Street, the Superhighway is segregated from other road traffic on a narrow, two-way cycle track. The track itself pre-dates the Cycle Superhighway, constructed as part of the London Cycle Network,http://www.eastendhomes.net/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n494.pdf&ver;=96 but CS3 introduced wayfinding and blue surfacing to aid routefinding. The Superhighway runs the entire length of Cable Street, passing both the Cable Street Mural and Shadwell DLR and London Overground stations. CS3 leaves Tower Hamlets on Royal Mint Street, entering the City of London.  Tower Gateway to Lancaster Gate  The Superhighway crosses London's Inner Ring Road near Tower Gateway station. Tower Bridge and the Tower of London are visible to the south of CS3. Entering the City of London, CS3 is a wide cycle track segregated from other road traffic. This remains the case until CS3 reaches the Palace of Westminster. In the City, the Superhighway avoids the busy centre, instead running in parallel to the Thames. Remaining segregated from other traffic, CS3 meets CS6 in a grade-separated junction at Blackfriars. At this point, the Superhighway crosses Victoria Embankment, following the Embankment until it reaches its southern terminus at the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Bridge. CS3 crosses the boundary between the City of London and the City of Westminster. Blackfriars. At the end of Victoria Embankment, CS3 heads westbound on Bridge Street, again as a wide, segregated cycle track, passing Parliament Square on its northernmost edge. CS3 then passes several government offices as it continues westbound, running along the entire length of Birdcage Walk (the southern boundary of St. James's Park). CS3 then heads briefly north, passing Buckingham Palace, before continuing westbound again on Constitution Hill as a segregated bike freeway. The Superhighway then passes through the middle of Hyde Park Corner, sharing space with pedestrians. Leaving Hyde Park Corner to the north, CS3 heads sharply westbound along a wide bike freeway which runs along the southern edge of Hyde Park (South Carriage Drive). At the end of the Drive, CS3 heads sharply northbound, following West Carriage Drive to its terminus at Lancaster Gate. The beginning of CS3 at Lancaster Gate is signposted towards Hyde Park Corner (11 mins), Westminster (20 mins) and Kensington.

In 2008, Livingstone proposed a \\"cycling transformation in London,\\" at the same time announcing the \\"biggest investment in cycling in London's history.\\" CS3 was one of the original twelve \\"motorways of cycling,\\" and was designed to take cyclists along the route it currently occupies from Barking to Lancaster Gate. It was proposed that CS3 would then join up with two further superhighways - CS9 and CS10 - to extend the network in to West London. When Boris Johnson became mayor in 2008, he proceeded with a modified Cycle Superhighways plan, which retained some of these radial routes, including the Barking to Tower Gateway CS3 as one of the first 2 routes to be delivered. But Johnson's plan initially excluded any major routes through the very centre of London. This decision to drop the central London routes was reversed 4 years later with a manifesto commitment made by Johnson in the 2012 London elections, which followed criticism of the design quality of the first Cycle Superhighways to be delivered, and a high profile campaign by London Cycling Campaign calling for upgrades and for the missing links across central London.https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/london-assembly/london-assembly- publications/gearing Johnson dubbed this central section of the route a \\"Crossrail for cyclists,\\" hoping to create a \\"cleaner, safer, greener city.\\"  References  Category:Cycleways in London ","title":"Cycle Superhighway 3"},{"id":"44838496","text":"Rajagopalan Krishnan Vaidyan (17 November 1932 ‚Äì 10 January 2015) was an Indian ayurvedic physician from the Indian state of Kerala and the president of the Association of Ayurvedic Physicians of Kerala.

She was born in Sachin, Gujarat, to a Muslim family and named Najma. Her father, Nawab Sidi Ibrahim Mohammad Yakut Khan III, was the Nawab of Sachin, near Surat in the state of Gujarat. Starting her career in the late 1920s with small roles in films like Second Wife (1928), Indira B. A. (1929) and Jayant (1929), she went on to do character roles before acting in the lead opposite Ashraf Khan in Veer Kunal (1932). After almost a decade of doing mainly action-oriented roles, she came into prominence with the Kidar Sharma- directed Chitralekha (1941). She married her early co-star Ashraf Khan with whom she had a son. They divorced later and she married Sohrab Modi in 1946. Modi cast her in the historical drama Jhansi Ki Rani (1953), which in spite of having spectacular scenes and lavish sets could not work well at the box office. She stopped acting in films following 1953 except to act in her last role as a character artist in Modi's Samay Bada Balwan (1969). She died in Mumbai on 10 April 1997. Career Mehtab acted in her early feature film Kamaal-e-Shamsheer (1930) with W. M. Khan, which was produced by her mother under Excelsior film company. Her other films at this time include Hamara Hindustan (1930), a silent film which starred Ruby Myers, Jal Merchant and Mazhar Khan. She went on to act in several films mainly in action roles produced by the Sharda Film Company under different directors. Finally in 1932, she acted under the banner of Indian Art Productions as the main female lead in Veer Kunal, opposite Ashraf Khan, an actor she was to marry and then divorce. She continued to work under different banners including Chandulal Shah for Ranjit Movietone in Bhola Shika (1933), directed by Jayant Desai, with E. Billimoria as hero, and Ranchandi directed by Babubhai Jani opposite Navin Chandra. She also acted in a couple of films directed by Jaddanbai like Moti Ka Haar and Jeevan Swapna, both in 1937. Following the birth of her son, and subsequent divorce from Ashraf Khan, Mehtab acted in the Film Corporation of India film Qaidi (1940), which had Ramola, Madhuri, Wasti and Nandrekar co- starring along with her. She got a chance in the film Chitralekha (1941). Chitralekha was also the debut of actor Bharat Bhushan, though in a small role. Mehtab was cast in Sharda (1942), along with Wasti, Ulhas and Nirmala Devi by A. R. Kardar for his Kardar Productions. The film is famous for the thirteen-year-old Suraiya, who became famous giving playback singing for a much older Mehtab. 1943 saw her acting in two more Kardar directed films; Kanoon with Shahu Modak, Nirmala Devi and Jagirdar and Sanjog a comedy film opposite Noor Mohammed Charlie, Wasti and Ulhas. The same year she did a Wadia Productions film directed by Homi Wadia, Vishwas (1943), which also starred Surendra, and Trilok Kapoor, with composer Firoz Nizami debuting as the music director. In 1944, Sohrab Modi cast Mehtab in the Central Studio production Parakh. Mehtab recalled in an interview that it was while shooting for this film that the two had grown closer. Modi did not act in the film which starred Mehtab with Yakub and Balwant Singh. Parakh had music by Khursheed Anwar and Saraswati Devi. Mehtab acted in films like Ismat (1944), Ek Din Ka Sultan (1945), Saathi (1946) and Shama (1946). In 1953, Modi produced, directed and acted in Jhansi Ki Rani, which starred a now ageing Mehtab as the young Jhansi Ki Rani. The film was a big financial disaster and the last starring role of Mehtab. Mehtab acted in Modi's Samay Bada Balwan (1969) in a character role. Personal life Mehtab a Muslim, married Sohrab Modi, a Parsi, on 28 April 1946, her birthday. According to Mehtab, the marriage was not approved of by Modi's family. This was Mehtab's second marriage and she had an eight-year-old son Ismail, from the previous marriage to her first co-star Ashraf Khan. Her condition for marrying Modi was that her son, Ismail, stay with them. Modi talked the situation over with her ex-husband, regarding Ismail, who then lived with Mehtab and Modi following their marriage. Modi was twenty years older at 46 years and had just finished his relationship with Naseem Banu. Mehtab and Modi had one child together called Mehelli, who they brought up as a Parsi. Sohrab Modi died on 28 January 1984, at the age of 85 years. Mehtab died on 10 April 1997 in Mumbai, Maharashtra and was buried at the Bada Qabrastan, Marine Lines, Mumbai.

The monastery had substantial income from its nearby spa so it established the printing house. Still, this income was insufficient for metal types. That is why hieromonk Teodosije, hegumen of the monastery, and his fellow monks, made types of 250 engraved wooden plates. They printed one book in this printing house, The Rujan Four Gospels (). The Ottomans burned monastery together with its printing house to prevent further printing of books. Since 1984 the remnants of this monastery are below Lake Vrutci.  Rujno Four Gospels  The Rujno Monastery printing house was one of the oldest printing houses in the Balkans and the oldest printing house on the territory of modern day Serbia (then Ottoman Empire). It was established and operational in a small monastery of Saint George in village Vrutci of Rujno ≈Ωupa near U≈æice in 1537. The monastery is also known as Rujno Monastery. Only one book was printed in Rujno Monastery printing house, The Rujan Four Gospels. It was printed by hieromonk Teodosije who used wooden types to print it. Dejan Medakoviƒá concluded that Rujno Monastery was poor so its hieromonk and printer Teodosije had to use wooden types. Some other authors believe that substantial income of monastery received from its spa actually contributed to establishment of the printing house. Medakoviƒá emphasize that this was not an advancement, but step back to older woodcut technique. For many months Teodosije carefully engraved 250 wooden plates to be used for printing. Because of the different shape of some letters it was concluded that he did not engrave all letters by himself. One book was in possession of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá.  Destruction of the printing house  When Ottomans received information about the existence of this printing house they burned monastery while its monks fled to Raƒça monastery. The remnants of the monastery were used to build madrasa in U≈æice. In one letter written by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá in 1857 he described wide red columns of the monastery he saw in madrasa.  Aftermath  The books printed in the printing house of Rujno Monastery had great influence to other nearby monasteries where they were manually transcribed. Today the exact location of the original monastery is unknown. The region where original Rujno Monastery was built is today below the surface of lake Vrutci built in 1984 for supply of U≈æice with potable water. New Rujno Monastery on another location was built in period 2004‚Äî2009.

Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 3. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. p. 157. Raka is located in the Municipality of Kr≈°ko. Raka Castle Panorama Franc Bajec, Raka Castle 1940 Raka Castle 1948-1998 Raka Castle 1995 Topography from 1678  History  Raka Castle () was documented as early as 1161 and explicitly mentioned as Castrum Arch in 1279. Built no later than the second half of the 12th century by the Counts of Bogen, it was inherited by the Counts of Andechs and then passed into the possession of the Dukes of Spanheim. The castle was sold by a relative of the Archer knights to Baron Georg von Scheyer. The Archer knights oversaw Raka Castle from 1248 until the end of their line at the close of the 15th century. In 1501, a relative of theirs, Leonhard Heriƒç from Kompolje in Blagovica, sold the castle to Baron Georg von Scheyer from Soteska. The castle was later burned in 1515 during a peasant revolt. In 1525, the castle and its estate were given in fief to Baron Johann Balthasar von Werneck by Archduke Karl. In the early 17th century, it was jointly owned by Baron Johann Ruess von Ruessenstein. Later on, Baron Franz Karl Haller von Hallerstein preserved the old castle from dilapidation. Through the 17th century, Raka Castle was owned by the Werneck barons and eventually sold to the Kajzelj family, who arranged greenhouse plots and a pond with crab breeding facilities below the castle. The old castle was preserved from its dilapidated state by Baron Franz Karl Haller von Hallerstein, who owned it from 1784 to 1825. He gave it a completely different and refined look, including new landscaped formal gardens and several purpose- built outbuildings. He further enlarged the Raka estate through purchases from the partial sale of the Studenice estate in 1800 and Dolenje Radulje in 1811. Towards the end of the 19th century, the castle was owned by the nobleman Felix Lenck. After his marriage to a high-profile American woman, Lenck built a sawmill in the vicinity, planted vineyards, and had a piped water supply installed in the castle from nearby Polter Spring. The castle was used as a military outpost during World War II. Between 1952 and 1961, Raka served as a municipal seat. In 1948, after expulsion from their convent, the Daughters of Charity moved into the castle, where they remained until 1998. In 2007, the castle was declared a monument of special architectural or historic interest by the Municipality of Kr≈°ko in order to protect the integrity of its landscape, architectural, artistic and historical value, strengthen its cultural testimony, present its cultural value in situ and in the media, and promote educational and scientific research work.  Architecture  Raka Castle is a quadrangular three-story building with a partial basement. It has an eleven-bay facade to the north and an eight-bay facade on its east side. To the west and south, the mansion is surrounded by woodlands and thickets. Passage around the castle itself is possible along a narrow, untended path. One enters the arcaded courtyard through a grand, classicist style stone portal. The castle (mansion) has been vacant and empty since the departure of the Sisters of Charity in 1998. Some interior furniture, toilets, and bathrooms are intact. The nuns installed plumbing in the mansion, enclosed the courtyard arcades with wood and glass, partially repaired the roof (which later fell into disrepair), and constructed a simple brick garage on the property behind the mansion. Only the south and the west wings of the building have basements, which can be accessed by broad wooden staircases directly off the courtyard. In the recent past, the ground floor was used mainly for livestock. The granary and pantry, located on the elevated ground floor of the west wing, were fitted with floor compartments to store crops and with wooden ceiling beams for hanging produce, various products originating from the estate, and general useful items. Broad stone stairs, set in the middle of the east wing, lead from the arcaded corridor to the first floor rooms, some of which are partitioned. The wooden floors are covered with linoleum. In the central part of the southern wing is a hall with a flat ceiling and a Baroque style parquet floor. One of the best preserved rooms is called Johanna's room. On the outer side a manual lift (dumbwaiter) was used to transfer food from the kitchen to the rooms. Also of interest is the food distribution area with a small, well preserved, built-in cabinet and barrier, and a distribution counter with cupboards. Although this space is larger than other rooms, it is not central. Instead, it connects the southern wing with the western and leads to the only open arcade above the northern entrance, framing only a passage. The attic features original paved flooring in places. The castle was purchased by Rok Mejak in December 2014.\\"Prodaja gradu Raka je uspela.\\" 2014. Dolenski list (17 December). The castle is closed to visitors until further notice.

History Transma√ßor was founded on 22 December 1987, from the merging of smaller operators that operated within the waters of the central group of Azorean islands. These included the Empresa das Lanchas do Pico, Lda., operator of the inter-island launches Espalamaca and Calheta; Empresa A√ßoriana de Transportes Mar√≠timos, Lda, that operated the yacht Terra Alta; and Transcanal - Transportes Mar√≠timos do Canal, Lda, owners of the traditional seagoing launches Picaroto and Manuel Jos√©. Transma√ßor operated with 80% social equity in the operation, while the regional government (in order to secure inter-island passage) held the remaining common shares. In 2011, the Regional Government of the obtained 88.37% of the common shares, with the remaining 11.63% stake taken by Empresa A√ßoriana de Transportes Mar√≠timos, Lda. On 22 November 2012, the regional secretary for Tourism and Transport, V√≠tor Fraga, indicated the need to integrate and coordinate inter- island travel between land, air and maritime traffc, resulting in an Integrated Plan for Transport (). Fraga indicated that it was necessary to \\"rationalize the [maritime] system, evolving into an integrated management of Atl√¢nticoline and Transma√ßor, by fusion, that permitted the desired economies of scale and a better optimization of operational results\\", noting that \\"on concluding, the construction of two new mixed-transport vessels for passengers and vehicles\\" was necessary (then in construction). By the beginning of 2014, the proposed merger of the inter-island operators had not occurred. While maintaining the brand Atlanticoline, the Government of the Azores would reform the new entity at the end of the mandate of the old Atlanticoline administrative council on 31 December 2013, but maintain the daily operation independent. The arrival of the two new RORO-enabled mixed-use vesselsGilberto Mariano and Mestre Sim√£o at the end of the summer, in the colours of Atlanticoline did not indicate a separate-but-equal operation of the new operator.

After being sold and exported to Hong Kong as a yearling he became one of the most successful and popular horses in his adopted territory. Equally adept as a sprinter or as a miler he won twelve of his twenty-six starts including the Chairman's Sprint Prize (twice) the Hong Kong Sprint, Hong Kong Stewards' Cup and Bauhinia Sprint Trophy. In 2000 he became the first Hong Kong horse to win a Grade One race abroad when he won the Yasuda Kinen in Japan. He won numerous awards including the title of Hong Kong Horse of the Year on two occasions. He was retired from racing in 2002 after undergoing surgery for serious leg injuries. After working for several years at a Hong Kong riding school he was sent into full retirement in New Zealand in 2011. Background Fairy King Prawn is a bay gelding bred in Australia by Catherine Redmond. His sire Danehill (who died in 2003) was a highly successful breeding stallion, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Duke of Marmalade, Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. Fairy King Prawn's dam Twiglet was a high-class Australian racehorse who won the Edward Manifold Stakes in 1990 and went on to be a successful broodmare, also producing the Salinger Stakes winner Easy Rocking. She was a descendant of Three Rock, whose other descendants included the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Green God. As a yearling, Fairy King Prawn was consigned to the Inglis Easter Sale and was bought for $180,000 by representatives of the Hong Kong businessman Philip Lau Sak Hong. In the early part of his racing career, the gelding was trained by Ricky P. F. Yiu. Racing career 1997/1998: two-year-old season On his only appearance of the 1997/1998 season, Fairy King Prawn won the Starlight Plate over 1000 metres at Sha Tin Racecourse on 28 March. 1998/1999: three-year- old season Fairy King Prawn began his second season with a win in a 1200-metre handicap race in September before finishing sixth in a similar event a month later and second in a race for three-year-olds over 1400 metres in November. He then won a handicap on 13 December and returned in February 1999 to record his biggest win thus far in the TVB Cup, beating the five-year- old Bumper Storm by two and three quarter lengths. After running second to Electronic Zone in the Hong Kong Telecom Cup Fairy King Prawn was moved up in class for the Chairman's Sprint Prize over 1200 metres on 8 May. Ridden by Steven King, he won by a neck from the Queen Elizabeth II Cup winner Oriental Express. On his final appearance of the season, Fairy King Prawn finished second to the New Zealand-bred Kingston Treasure in the Sha Tin Vase. 1999/2000: four-year-old season On his debut as a four-year-old, Fairy King Prawn finished seventh when carrying a weight of 135 pounds in a 1200-metre handicap on 5 September and then finished second to Best of the Best when dropped in distance for the Panasonic Cup over 1000 metres in November. On 12 December, Fairy King Prawn contested the inaugural running of the Hong Kong Sprint in which he faced an international field including Big Jag (winner of the San Carlos Handicap) from the United States, Nuclear Debate and Sainte Marine (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne) from France, Proud Native (Ballyogan Stakes) and Tedburrow (Flying Five Stakes) from Britain, Dantelah (Oakleigh Plate) from Australia.

Fairy King Prawn took the lead inside the last 200 metres and won by a length from Crystal Charm with Big Jag in third ahead of Dantelah. In January Fairy King Prawn started favourite for the Bauhinia Sprint Trophy over 1000 metres but was beaten one and a quarter lengths by the 33/1 outsider Holy Grail. The gelding finished runner-up again in his next two races, finishing second to Best of the Best in the Centenary Sprint Cup in March. He was then transferred to the stable of Ivan Allan, with Robbie Fradd taking over from Steven King as his jockey. On his first appearance for his new stable he was beaten a neck by Tajasur when attempting to repeat his 1999 success in the Chairman's Prize. On his final appearance of the season, Fairy King Prawn attempted to become the first Hong Kong-trained racehorse to win a Group/ Grade I race abroad when he was sent to Japan to contest the Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 4 June. The Godolphin stable, which had won the race five years earlier with Heart Lake was represented by Diktat, a five-year-old who had won the Prix Maurice de Gheest in France and the Haydock Sprint Cup in England. The locally trained runners included Eagle Cafe (NHK Mile Cup), Black Hawk (Sprinters Stakes), Umeno Fiber (Yushun Himba) and King Halo (Takamatsunomiya Kinen). Fairy King Prawn raced well behind the leaders before moving out to the far outside in the straight. He took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won the race by one and a quarter lengths from Diktat, with King Halo the best of the Japanese runners in third place. 2000/2001: five-year-old season Fairy King Prawn began his five-year-old season in October at Happy Valley Racecourse where he carried 135 pounds to victory in the Happy Valley Handicap and then finished second by a short head to King of Danes in the Sprint Trial Trophy at Sha Tin in November, conceding twenty-two pounds to the winner. Rather than attempting to repeat his previous success in the Hong Kong Sprint, Fairy King Prawn was moved up in distance to contest the Hong Kong Mile on 17 December. Starting the 4.3/1 second favourite he was towards the rear of the fourteen-runner field for most of the way before making rapid progress in the straight but failed by a short head to catch the New Zealand mare Sunline, with the pair finishing four and a half lengths clear of the other runners. On 14 January Fairy King Prawn started 3/5 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Electronic Unicorn for the Hong Kong Stewards' Cup (the first leg of the Hong Kong Triple Crown) over 1600 metres. He came from well off the pace to accelerate clear of the field in the last 200 metres and won easily by one and a half lengths from the 25/1 outsider Magnifier with Electronic Unicorn in third place. Twelve days later the gelding was dropped in distance for his second attempt at the Bauhinia Sprint Trophy and started 6/5 favourite in a field of fourteen runners which included King of Danes and Best of the Best. Ridden by Fradd, he took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by three-quarters of a length and two lengths from Kenwood Melody and Trinculo. After the race, the South China Morning Posts senior racing writer Lawrence Wadey wrote: \\"The Prawn is racing's Tiger Woods, soccer's Rivaldo, Zinedine and David Beckham all rolled into one; he is this sport's Michael Schumacher and Lennox Lewis. In the context of Hong Kong, he's a sporting colossus.\\" On 3 March he started favourite for the Hong Kong Gold Cup (the second leg of the Triple Crown) despite racing for the first time over 2000 metres. After being towards the rear as usual in the early stages he moved forward in the straight but finished sixth of the twelve runners, two and a quarter lengths behind the winner Idol. Fairy King Prawn raced overseas for the second time when he was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Duty Free over 1800 metres at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 24 March. He started 5/1 joint second favourite behind Sunline, and alongside the French gelding Jim And Tonic. After being restrained by Fradd in the early stages, Fairy King Prawn made a strong run on the outside in the straight to overtake Sunline 150 metres from the finish but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by Jim And Tonic. Four weeks later, Fairy King Prawn returned to Hong Kong and won the Chairman's Prize for the second time, beating Trinculo by four lengths when ridden for the first time by Weichong Marwing. In June he attempted to repeat his 2000 success in the Yasuda Kinen but finished ninth of the eighteen runners behind Black Hawk. His participation in the race had been in doubt owing to restrictions imposed as a result of the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. 2001/2002: six-year-old season Fairy King Prawn's only appearance in his final season came on 1 October in the National Day Cup over 1400 metres in which he was required to concede at least twelve pounds to each of his thirteen opponents. Ridden again by Marwing he won the race by two lengths from Meridian Star, with Oriental Express, Crystal Charm and Best of the Best among the unplaced runners. In January 2002, the gelding underwent surgery which entailed the removal of a portion of a fractured splint bone and an injection to a strained ligament. Awards and assessment Fairy King Prawn was named Hong Kong Horse of the Year and Hong Kong Most Popular Horse of the Year in both 2000 and 2001 before taking a third \\"Most Popular\\" award in 2002. In 2001 he had been named Hong Kong Champion Sprinter and Hong Kong Champion Miler. Retirement Fairy King Prawn was officially retired from racing in February 2003. He spent several years at Tuen Mun Public Riding School, providing experience for new riders. In 2011 the horse was sent to New Zealand to provide what Lau called \\"a bigger and more comfy place for the old racehorse to live happily and healthily.\\" Pedigree *Like all of Danehill's offspring Fairy King Prawn is inbred 4 √ó 4 to the mare Natalma.

It was screened in the main competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Alfred Bauer Prize. The film was selected as the Guatemalan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards but was not nominated. It is the first film produced in the Kaqchikel language of the Mayan family.Ixcanu, Roger Ebert website Plot The film is set in a village built on the slopes of a volcano, where Maria and her parents cultivate coffee. The villages like other Mayan practice a mixture of Catholicism and the traditional Mayan religion, worshiping the Christian God while also making offerings to the goddess that they believe lives inside of the volcano. Maria has never been beyond the volcano and her world is the village. Maria has been promised to the foreman of the plantation, Ignacio, in an arranged marriage, but Maria is involved with a young man, Pepe, who wants to emigrate to the United States. Pepe gives uncertain answers when she asks him if he would take her with him. Pepe paints a picture of America to Maria as a land of plenty and promise, a place where the people enjoy a level of affluence that is unthinkable in Guatemala. Meanwhile, the plantation is overridden with poisonous snakes, making it hazardous for Maria and her family to sow the fields. Ignacio goes away to the city for a while, saying he will marry Maria upon his return. The virgin Maria becomes curious about sex, drinks nectar from an aphoristic tree, and masturbates against the tree trunk. Empowered, Maria seduces Pepe outside of the makeshift bar that serves the coffee workers while he tells her that there is no danger of pregnancy. As a result of her affair with Pepe, Maria becomes pregnant. Pepe promises to take Maria with him when he leaves for America, but does not. Maria's parents are furious when they learn she is pregnant, saying that Ignacio will have them evicted. Juana, Maria's mother, tries various folk remedies to induce an abortion, none of which work, leading her to the conclusion that the child is meant to be born. Maria argues that if the snakes are driven away, a new crop coffee will be planted in the field, which would require the labour of her parents, making it impossible for the landlord to evict them. Maria and Juana burn the field, but the snakes return. After Juana tells her that being pregnant endows her with a magical \\"light\\" that will chase away the snakes as her body becomes a metaphorical volcano, Maria becomes convinced that if she walks across the field, her \\"light\\" will drive away the snakes. Maria sees a Mayan shaman who performs a ceremony to stoke the \\"light\\" inside of her, but Juana tries to dissuade her, saying not all magic is real. In an attempt to drive the snakes away by walking across the field, Maria is bitten and driven to the hospital in a nearby city. At the hospital, the Spanish-speaking staff do not understand Kaqchikel, making it impossible for Maria to understand what is being said to her or the form she is asked to initial. She survives but is told by the nurse that her baby died. Maria and her family go home with a coffin. Maria demands to look inside the coffin because she wants to see her daughter but upon opening it, she finds an empty coffin with a brick and a blanket. Maria and her family return to the city to report the missing child. However, instead of helping, the Spanish-speaking police officers who do not understand Kaqchikel advise the family not to file a complaint, because Maria and her family would be the primary suspects in the case. The film ends with a resigned Maria being dressed as a traditional Mayan bride as she prepares to marry Ignacio. Cast * Mar√≠a Mercedes Coroy as Maria * Mar√≠a Tel√≥n as Juana * Marvin Coroy as El Pepe * Manuel Manuel Ant√∫n as Manuel * Justo Lorenzo as Ignacio Production Ixcanul has a largely non-professional cast. In an interview, Jayro Bustamante, the film's Spanish-speaking director stated he wanted to shoot a film in Kaqchikel because of its low status in Guatemala, being seen as \\"the language of the Indians\\". Bustamante wrote the script for Ixcanul in French while studying at a film school in Paris, then translated it into Spanish upon his return to Guatemala, and finally had it translated into Kaqchikel. In Guatemala, street theater is a honorable and respected profession, and Bustamante recruited his cast from street theater veterans. Bustamante recalled that he put up a sign saying \\"casting\\", and no-one came; when he put up a sign the next day saying \\"employment opportunities\\", he was deluged with would-be actors. Casting his actresses proved to be a major difficulty in the patriarchal society of Guatemala where machismo is the dominant value as most of the husbands of the street theater actresses proved unwilling to allow their wives to work in a film unsupervised. Mar√≠a Tel√≥n, a veteran street theater actress, was cast as Juana largely because as a widow she had no husband to answer to. The 19-year old Mar√≠a Mercedes Coroy, who had never acted before, needed her self-confidence built up to play Maria as Bustamante recalled her saying to him: \\"Do you remember when we first started rehearsing? I wouldn‚Äôt open my legs 10 centimeters to do yoga. Then the next thing I know I‚Äôm naked in front of the entire country!\\" Bustamanate stated he chose to focus on his female characters because: \\"In Guatemala, we ignore the strength of women. We throw it away\\". Bustamante commented that the film's subtitles did not convey the full richness of the dialogue, noting that in Kaqchikel the word ixcanul means not only volcano, but also \\"the internal force of the mountain which boils looking for eruption.\\" Reception In a negative review, Scott Marks in San Diego Reader called Ixcanul a \\"dilatory drama\\" whose slow pace would alienate most audiences. Daniel Barnes wrote: \\"A frank depiction of sexuality is one of the film‚Äôs strongest assets, but the attempts to force melodrama fall flat, and the protagonist is such a moon- faced cipher that it feels almost insultingly respectful. There‚Äôs nothing glaringly wrong with Ixcanul, it‚Äôs just hard to get whipped up for stoicism.\\" Ed Frankel wrote in a laudatory review: \\"Guatemala‚Äôs first-ever entry for the foreign language Oscar is an absorbing, beautifully-shot drama of cultural ritual and the drive of one young woman to escape a rudimentary social system.\\" In a review in The Washington Post, Stephanie Merr wrote: \\"Mar√≠a Mercedes Coroy is riveting, especially as the story takes a turn for the tragic. Few actors convey so much with little more than a deadpan expression. Tel√≥n, as the outspoken, larger-than-life Juana, is her perfect counterbalance. Even when she‚Äôs disappointed with Mar√≠a, she can‚Äôt hide the profound love she feels for her only child...It all looks fascinatingly foreign to American eyes, but Mar√≠a‚Äôs story ‚Äî about rebellion and consequences, oppression and heartbreak ‚Äî is anything but.\\" Alex Midgal wrote in The Globe & Mail: \\"Like its titular Guatemalan volcano, Jayro Bustamante's hypnotic film debut Ixcanul bubbles with the tension of a teenage girl at odds with her family's native customs, before erupting into a frantic and quietly devastating third act.\\" Alisssa Wilkinson wrote in her review: \\"Shot luminously by Luis Armando Arteaga, each frame holds steady on its subject, inviting the audience to calmly observer the daily routines and customs of its subjects in saturated colors that seem almost to glow\\". The critic Frank Ochieng wrote in his review: \\"Writer-director Jayro Bustamante‚Äôs absorbing and revealing debut feature, Ixcanul, paints a disturbing portrait that crosses the fine line between tradition and exploitation in the name of the Guatemalan children sacrificed to uphold economical expectations among other considerations. The indigenous existences of children globally are jeopardized through ritualistic justifications that many find vehemently inexcusable and horrifying...Ironically, the only true element that is systematically explosive about Ixcanul is not the proximity of the aforementioned volcano, but the voiceless and powerless minor that does not have a decent say about the psychological and physical loaning of her body to the highest child- exploitive bidder. Unconscionable and regrettably humanistic in tragedy and deemed practicality, Ixcanul is strikingly hypnotic and forceful among the nearby ominous alert of lava-spewing anticipation.\\" David Lewis wrote in his review: \\"Ixcanul, which takes place near a volcano in Guatemala, is a lyrical film that plays like a well-done National Geographic special ‚Äî until it unexpectedly turns lava-hot.Throughout, Ixcanul impresses with its attention to detail, chronicling the daily routines of a Mayan coffee-farming village, an isolated place where cars, cell phones and televisions appear to be nonexistent. The ashen volcano hovers ominously, a symbol of pent-up feelings and a smoldering conflict between modernity and tradition.\\" Andrew Parker wrote in his review: \\"It often feels like there are a few different movies going on within Ixcanul at the same time, but they‚Äôre all well constructed enough to make it come together as a mostly cohesive whole. It will definitely be interesting to see where Bustamante goes from here.\\" Dianne Carson wrote about Ixcanul: \\"Beautifully shot with local residents represented in the cast, the story gains momentum and tragic dimensions as it progresses,\\" Nathaniel Hood wrote in his review: \\"The film is comfortably languid, interposing Maria‚Äôs tribulations with the rhythms of everyday life: comings and goings, bouts of drunkenness and lovemaking, moments of stillness and silence. The plot takes off in the last third following a disastrous misjudgment leaving Maria next to dead. After being taken to a hospital, healthcare workers manipulate the language barrier between them and Maria‚Äôs family to seize her baby, telling her that it died and giving them a coffin with a brick wrapped in cloth in place of the body.\\" In a review, J. Don Birnam wrote: \\"It is stunning that, by the end of the film, one is so immersed into the lives of these characters, of their culture and traditions, that when they are thrust into what should be (for us) the more comfortable space of the city and modern civilization, the contrast is jarring and unsettling. The greatest success of the film is that we are made to feel as though we have come to deeply understand a culture that is so deeply unfamiliar to us. In doing so, the movie touches upon many of the challenges and injustices faced by indigenous American peoples, including their inability to communicate, their lack of access to medicine, and more brutal things like corruption at the hands of authorities\\". Jay Kuehner wrote: \\"Bustamente thus lays the foundation of a story that‚Äôs ancient and modern, old as the cinder hills that the family navigates to offer prayers. Enter men into this picture and a tragic element emerges beneath the agrarian routine of harvest, drinking, and waiting for pay. Tempting the mythological, there is a surfeit of snakes in the land these people toil.\\" In a review for the Asahi Shimubm, Claudia Puig wrote: \\"Ixcanul is a mesmerizing, intimate and meditative coming-of- age tale that explores a culture rarely seen in films\\". Justin Chang in The Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Yet even as it moves from tender ethnographic portraiture into a realm of hushed, intimate tragedy, Ixcanul quivers with a fierce if understated feminine energy. You can feel it in the women‚Äôs honest, matter-of-fact acknowledgments of desire (notably, every sexual encounter in the picture is initiated by a female). And the movie‚Äôs true hero is arguably not Mar√≠a but Juana, wonderfully played by Tel√≥n as a pillar of big-hearted resilience even as she acknowledges the limitations of her knowledge. In the story‚Äôs most devastating moment, Juana cradles her daughter in her arms in the back of a moving truck, weeping as they race the clock toward an uncertain future.\\" In a review in The Manchester Guardian, Jordan Hoffman wrote: \\"What‚Äôs most striking about Ixcanul is the elegant way in which it is shot. Scenes are given space, and the audience is allowed ample time to soak up the atmosphere. This is the type of movie that stays with you. The next time I buy a can of coffee, I‚Äôll be more cognisant of where it came from.\\" In a review in the New York Times, Jeannette Catsolius wrote: \\"More than a fable about the clash of tradition and modernity, Ixcanul is finally a painful illustration of the ease with which those who have power can prey on those who don't\\". Nathaniel Rogers wrote in his review: \\"The volcano, in addition to being a beautiful and alien visual backdrop for a movie is also a monolithic wall, blocking their view of the rest of the world; Mexico and the United States, to the North, are more myth than reality. The family hopes to marry their sexually curious daughter off to their comparatively rich boss and thereby lift all their futures. Needless to say, things don't go as planned. While the actions of nearly all the characters are often enraging, Ixcanul is never mean spirited, condemning the exploitation of their ignorance rather than the ignorance itself...Bustamante's well crafted film is authentically steeped in a nearly alien culture but its humanity is entirely familiar.\\" Sean Axmaker praised the film, writing: \\"The feature debut of Guatemalan filmmaker Jayro Bustamante is a beautiful and unsentimental portrait of traditional Mayan culture where peasants live in huts without electricity or running water and speak their native Kaqchikel, unable to communicate with the Spanish speakers from the nearby city without an interpreter...Like all of the cast members, Coroy is not a professional actress but her enigmatic face and impassive expression is mesmerizing and she communicates a longing for something more and the determination to stand up for herself. The landscape is stunning, vast and beautiful and dangerous, and beyond the jungle is the massive monolith of black rock and ash that seems to trap them in their poverty.\\" Radheyan Simonpillai likewise praised the film, writing: \\"Whether we‚Äôre closely gazing at Maria or watching her stride along the ashy volcano‚Äôs side from a distance, Bustamante lets images linger long enough for their beauty to fall away, giving us a compelling and tragic look at where our coffee comes from.\\" Kelly Vance described the film as \\"Jayro Bustamante's gorgeously photographed Ixcanul is the ideal village-picture fable, as fascinating for its innate mythology as for its ethnography.\\" Michael Atkinson lauded the film, writing: \\"Touching on multiple feminist issues as it goes, and even venturing, gallingly, into the matter of baby trafficking, Ixcanul can suffer from predictability‚ÄîBustamante's desire to universalize Maria's arc sometimes makes it end up feeling familiar. But the film's rhythms, details and visuals, particularly that volcano, are vivid and unique.\\" See also * List of submissions to the 88th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Guatemalan submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film References External links * Category:2015 films Category:2015 drama films Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:French films Category:French drama films Category:Guatemalan films Category:Films set in Guatemala Category:Films shot in Guatemala Category:Spanish-language films Category:Mayan-language films ","title":"Ixcanul"},{"id":"44839421","text":"Peasistilifer is a genus of parasitic sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Eulimidae.Bouchet, P.

The Syntheist Movement sees itself as the practical realisation of a philosophical ambition for a new religion dating back as far as Baruch Spinoza's pantheism in the 17th century and, most directly, British-American philosopher Alfred North Whitehead's pioneering work towards a process theology in his books Religion in the Making in 1926 and Process and Reality in 1929.Whitehead, A.N. (1926). Religion in the Making (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996)Whitehead, A.N. (1929). Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927‚Äì1928, Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK. Syntheism may also be viewed as a response to the lack of atheistic and pantheistic belief systems in Western cultures, while being more abundant in Eastern cultures, for example as Zen Buddhism, Dzogchen Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta Hinduism, and Jainism. Logo used by The Syntheist Movement, describing the Universe as an ellipse over the circle of the primordial void  Etymology  Syntheism was coined from the Greek syntheos (from syn- for with or creating with and -theos for god). It implies that the proper approach to the concept of God is that humanity has created, creates or will eventually create God ‚Äì as opposed to the traditional monotheistic view that God created the world and humanity. Besides the activism of The Syntheist Movement, a syntheistic approach to philosophy and religion has also been advocated by American philosopher Ray Kurzweil in his concept of the forthcoming Singularity. It is also supported by French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux in his idea of \\"God is a concept far too important to leave to the religious\\" in his book After Finitude.Meillassoux, Quentin (2006).

A Syntheist congregation conducting a workshop in Lindsberg, Sweden in June 2014.  Notable works  When Swedish cyberphilosophers Alexander Bard and Jan S√∂derqvist published their syntheist manifesto Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age in October 2014, it became the first book to actively use the term Syntheism in its title. Bard & S√∂derqvist frequently quote Stuart Kauffman, Sam Harris, Robert Corrington and Simon Critchley in the book, but also find inspiration for a syntheist worldview from a variety of contemporary phenomena such as digitalisation, globalisation, participatory culture, psychedelic practices, quantum physics and the science of cosmology.  Beliefs  Syntheism is the belief that the classic division between theism and atheism in theology has become redundant and must be overcome to fulfill contemporary and future spiritual needs. This requires the acknowledgement that all metaphysical beliefs center on a divinity or focal point which is man-made. Therefore, all current and future religious beliefs are created by humans, as well as systems such as Individualism developed by philosophers like Ren√© Descartes and Immanuel Kant). Despite being human creations, what is important is that these beliefs strengthen, and not contradict, science. They must therefore be developed within a monist worldview (the conviction that there is one world and one world only, and that everything within this one world can affect everything else). In a more poetic vein, Bataille describes his atheology as ‚Äúthe art of non-knowledge‚Äù. He rather advocates a syntheist religion without a core set of beliefs. Participatory festivals with utopian themes such as Burning Man are considered examples of syntheistic practice.  Criticisms  Lack of central leadership and core beliefs have led some scholars, such as Dr. Stephen O'Leary, to believe Syntheism will fail. The idea has also been criticised for a potential lack of mystery.

It was built on the area of the former Davao Sports Complex, torn down by fire in 2003. Construction began and ended on two significant dates: 11-11-11 (11 November 2011) and 12-12-12 (12 December 2012). The complex is the main hub for the 2015 Palarong Pambansa events, including the opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium is now the home of Philippines Football League outfit Davao Aguilas F.C. since their founding in 2017. History A previous sports facility called the Davao Sports Complex stood in the lot where the future DNSTC is to be built; the old sports complex consisted of two wooden grandstands and a partially-covered gymnasium, with a gravel athletics track, a partially-turfed football field, and a gravel baseball diamond. The lot was then used as a motocross track. In 2007, plans were being made to reconstruct the sports complex using better materials with an avant-garde design, with the aim of building the most modern sports facility throughout the Philippines. The initial design was drawn up and presented in 2008; this was designed by Sol U. Flores (who also designed the New City Hall of Tagum). The initial cost for the reconstruction project amounted to PHP350 million. However, the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 caused the prices for the project materials (which were mostly imported) to exceed the budget. This prompted the provincial government to use the budget for other services. In 2011, Davao del Norte Governor Rodolfo P. Del Rosario revived the project as part of the province's bid to host the 2015 Palarong Pambansa, but this time it followed a more conventional design. Project cost amounted to PHP 243 million. Construction began on 11 November 2011 and was completed on the target date of 12 December 2012. The Provincial Government plans to construct a sports academy within the DNSTC after the 2015 Palarong Pambansa in order to support the province's sports development programs for its homegrown athletes and athletes throughout Mindanao and the entire country as well. After confirming its participation in the Philippines Football League, the Davao Aguilas announced that they will be using the stadium as their home ground for the PFL. Facilities oval track DNSTC Aquatic Center RDR Gymnasium DNSTC Tennis Courts The complex has several sporting facilities including a 3,000-capacity main grand stand, an rubberized eight- track athletics oval, an Aquatic Center featuring a ten-lane Olympic size swimming pool (50 meters) with a warm up pool (12 meters) that has a grandstand with 500 person capacity, two lawn tennis courts, an air- conditioned multi-purpose gymnasium (Rodolfo P. Del Rosario Gymnasium, RDR Gymnasium) that can be used for indoor games, two football fields (one inside the track oval and one beside it) and a club house. The complex also has a lighting system for night events consisting of four light towers with high- intensity bulbs and additional LED lights on the main grandstand, allowing for late afternoon to night events to be conducted. The main grandstand has several multi-purpose rooms that can used for other indoor games such as table tennis or chess, or be used as work rooms, storage rooms for equipment, clinics, or food distribution centers. A VIP Lounge with a holding room is provided for visiting dignitaries and special guests. Offices for the Provincial Sports Office and the Building and a sub-office for the Ground Maintenance Division of the Provincial General Services Office are located in the main grandstand and Aquatic Center grandstand, respectively. The clubhouse features a canteen operated by the provincial government employees' cooperative, an open-air dining area, and an air-conditioned conference room; it can be rented for special events by individuals or groups through a reservation with the cooperative. In order to accommodate more events during the 2015 Palarong Pambansa, an additional football field and archery range were added. Both are provided with steel bleachers and viewing areas to accommodate a small audience. Tourism Village The DavNor Pasalubong Shop and Tourism Village are located behind the RDR Gymnasium and Aquatic Center. A covered area with lights and sound fixtures is available for night events such as concerts. The area also has spaces where tenants can set up their stalls and sell their products.

Like other species in the genus Grylloblatta, it is endemic to North America. Taxonomy This species was the first grylloblatid discovered and formally described in the scientific literature by Edmund Walker in 1914. It was originally placed in the order Orthoptera but has since been placed in the order Notoptera. There are currently four subspecies: * G. c. athapaska Kamp, 1979 * G. c. campodeiformis Walker, 1914 * G. c. nahanni Kamp, 1979 * G. c. occidentalis Silvestri, 1931 Description Illustration by Walker (1914) Adults are typically long, excluding ovipositors and cerci, and are fairly elongate, wingless insects. They are a uniform honey-yellow in colour and covered with very short hair. Unlike some other species of grylloblatid, G. campodeiformis has eyes which have roughly 70 facets. The head is fairly flat and rounded. The thorax is elongate and over a third of the body length. The abdomen is composed of 10 segments and over half the body length. The legs are long and narrow (cursorial) with stout coxae and long femora. Their antennae are long ~ and thread-like. In adults the number of antennal subsegments is variable ranging from 24 to 27. Biology Diet Rock crawlers are nocturnal predators and scavengers that actively search for small, invertebrate prey. They also venture onto snowfields, foraging for ‚Äúinsect-fallout‚Äù carried and deposited there by wind. Distribution and habitat This species was originally discovered on Sulphur Mountain, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies at an altitude of 6500 feet. Subsequently it has been recorded from British Columbia (Canada), Montana, Washington (USA). They are ground dwelling animals, living between small stones and debris during the day. While they can survive warmer temperatures of up to they are typically nocturnal, becoming active on snow fields at cooler temperatures of around making them psychrophilic. Like other North American grylloblatids, G. campodeiformis is at some risk of extinction due to its habitat requirements and reduced mobility.

Species habit and description It produces four large (12 x 12 cm), fleshy leaves which lie flat on the ground and form a basal rosette. They are glabrous above and pubescent below, especially along the midrib. The leaf margin is entire, often with an edging of purple-pink. The inflorescence is terminal, growing from the center of the rosette. The flowers are showy, yellow, and open singly and die rapidly, but are immediately followed by another. The species becomes dormant during winter, shrinking to a centipede-like rhizome without roots. In spring it produces paddle-shaped leaves that appress to the soil when fully formed, similar to water-lily pads. The abaxial leaf surface has a spongy white texture. Flowers are bright yellow with a crisped margin, and some 9 cm across, with a large staminodial labellum, and resembling those of a pumpkin. The texture of the flower is soft and thin.

She was born as a Karakhanid princess, the daughter of Tamghach Khan Ibrahim. She was the mother of Mahmud I, the next ruler of the Seljuk Empire, and regent during his minority in 1092‚Äì1094.Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. . Marriage Alp Arslan, father of Malik-Shah gave his own daughter Princess Aisha Khatun to Sham al-Mulk Nasr, the son and successor of the Qara Khanid Tamghach Khan Ibrahim, Terkhan Khatun's father. Later in 1065 he married his son to Terken Khatun, who was aged twelve at the time and Malik-Shah was about the same age. Nizam al-Mulk's position vis-√†-vis the sultan was thus to some extant unsatisfactory, and his influence at the subordinate households of the sultan's wives and those of the princes was still weaker. Terken Khatun's household became the focus of opposition, for Taj al-Mulk was also her personal intendant. The vizier doubtless had Terken Khatun in mind when in the Siyasat-Nama he denounced the malevolent influence of women at court, citing their misleading advice to the ruler and their susceptibility to promptings from their attendants and eunuchs. Terken Khatun's son Dawud had been his father's favourite son, but he died in 1082. Six years later Malik-Shah had capital approval when he proclaimed as heir another of his sons, Abu Shuja Ahmad, and gave him a resplendent string of honorifics, but in the following year he too died. After these disappointments it was not surprising that Terken Khatun wanted to promote the succession of her third son Mahmud, despite the fact that he was the youngest of all the possible candidates. Towards the end of Malik-Shah's reign, Qodun, the shahna of Marv, complained to the Sultan that he had been seized by Nizam al-Mulk's son, Shams al-Din Uthman who was rais of Marv. Malik Shah wrote to Nizam al-Mulk reproaching him with these words, \\"These your children have each gained the mastery over a large district and govern large province. But this does not satisfy them and they exceed what a politic and desire to do this and that.\\" Nizam al-Mulk defended himself but on this occasion the Sultan's jealousy was not assuaged and he began to plot against the life of the vizier. Terken Khatun added fuel to the fire, accusing Nizam al-Mulk of dividing the kingdom among his children. Her apposition to Nizam al-Mulk was due to his having urged Malik Shah to nominate Barkiyaruq, the thirteen year old son of Zubaida Khatun, heir apparent, whereas she wished her own son Mahmud, an infant, to be so nominated and was supported in this by Taj al-Mulk Abu'l-Ghana'im Marzban ibn Khusrau Firuz, was vizier to Terken Khatun. She joined an intrigue mounted against Nizam al-Mulk by Taj al-Mulk, Majid al- Mulk Baravistani Qummi, the mustaufi, Sadid al-Mulk, the aird. Regency In 1092, when Malik Shah I was assassinated shortly after Nizam al-Mulk, Taj al- Mulk nominated Mahmud as Sultan and set out for Isfahan. Mahmud was a child, and his mother Terken Khatun wished to seize power in his stead. To accomplish this, she entered in negotiations with the Abbasid Caliph al-Muqtadi to secure her rule. The Caliph opposed both a child and a woman as ruler, and could not be persuaded to allow the khutba, the sign of the sovereign, to be proclaimed in the name of a woman: eventually, however, the Caliph agreed to let her govern if the khutba was said in the name of her son, and if she did so assisted by a vizier he appointed for her, a condition to which she saw herself forced to accept.Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. . On arrival in Isfahan, Taj al-Mulk seized and imprisoned Barkiyaruq on Terken Khatun's orders, but the Nizamiyya mamluks, who hated Terken Khatun because of her enmity to their late master, set Barkiyaruq free and took him to Rey, where the rais of the city, Nizam al-Mulk's son-in-law crowned him. Taj al-Mulk and Terken Khatun set out after Barkiyaruq, but were defeated at Borujerd in 1092‚Äì93. Terken Khatun retired with her forces to Isfahan, where she was besieged.

Built in 1899, this now-vacant wood frame building has seen a variety of commercial, civic and social uses. It was first used as a factory for the manufacture of spruce gum before being acquired by the local Grange chapter in 1911, and was used for social events as well as town meetings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Grange hall is a large rectangular clapboarded wood frame structure with a central hip-roofed block flanked by shed-roofed additions. The main block is five bays wide, with a centered entrance; the left addition has a single window on the first floor, while the right addition has a second entry and window on the first floor, and another window on the second. The interior of the first floor consists of a large open space, with a raised platform at one end, and a storage area behind. At the east end of the building is another storage area, and stairs leading to the second floor, which is similar to the first, except there is no raised platform, and the storage area is larger. The main block of the building was constructed in 1899 by Frank W. Bragg, a local resident who set up a spruce gum manufacturing operation on the premises. This business declined with the advent of new forms of chewing gum, so Bragg sold the building to the local Grange organization in 1911. The Grange converted the lower floor into a social and meeting venue, and it was used by the community for social events (dances and parties) as well as town meetings. This use continued until the Grange chapter dissolved in the 1970s, and the building was sold into private hands.

August 1960 in Braunschweig) was a German mechanical engineer and university lecturer at the Technical University of Braunschweig . He developed the theoretical foundations of modern centrifugal pump construction. Life and Work The son of the clothier Carl Pfleiderer (1845-1927) and his wife Marie, born Wirth (1847-1895) graduated in 1899 from the secondary school. He studied from 1901 to 1905 mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Stuttgart and completed his studies with the state examination and the degree of Dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur. In 1906 following the promotion of Doktoringenieur, with a thesis on dynamic processes during start- up of equipment. This was followed in 1907 by several years in the industry as a design engineer for pumps and steam engines. From 1909 he worked for the Thyssen company in M√ºlheim an der Ruhr as a senior engineer and head of the department. Lecturing in Braunschweig On January 1, 1912, Pfleiderer was appointed a professor of steam engineering at the Technical University of Braunschweig. During the World War I, he served his military service from 1914, until 1917 as the chief man and leader of an artillery battery. Returning to the university, he has been running the high-school power plant since 1920, which has also been used for research and training purposes. From 1945 to 1947, Pfleiderer was the rector of the university. Pfleiderer was emeritus in 1949 and lived in Duchess-Elisabeth-Strasse in Braunschweig in 1951. In September 1952, Hartwig Petermann (1919-1997) became his successor as an institute leader. Honours Pfleiderer was appointed an honorary doctorate on the occasion of his 70th birthday, from the University of Stuttgart in 1951. In 1951 he was made an honorary senator of the Braunschweig University of Technology and an honorary member of the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure. In 1956 he was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit medal and in the same year, the Pfleiderer Institute for Fluid Machinery (abbr. VDI) was named after him. In Brunswick, the location Pfleidererstra√üe in the district :de:Kanzlerfeld was named after him. On the occasion of his 100th birthday, at the VDI conference in Hydraulic Machinery, the Carl Pfleiderer Memorial meeting was held at the TU Braunschweig between 14 and 16 October 1981. On his 125th birthday Prof. Dr. Ing. Carl Pfleiderer, a meeting took place from 3 July to 15 September 2006 with an exhibition in the Braunschweig University Library to celebrate his life and achievements. Scientific Achievement Pfleiderer's most important research area was centrifugal pump construction. Pumps for pumping liquids have been used for a long time, but they lacked a well-founded calculation basis for their design. These procedures were developed and patented by Pfleiderer, whereby Pfleiderer 's low-performance approach has attracted worldwide attention and is still being applied today. His work, published in 1932, on Die Kreiselpumpen soon became the standard work for the calculation and construction of centrifugal pumps. Publications * The centrifugal pumps.

Life Early years Nuding was born in a small town some 35 km (18 miles) to the east of Stuttgart early on in the twentieth century. His father was a factory worker. An early ambition to become a teacher was thwarted by the outbreak of war when he was twelve. After leaving school in 1916 he started an apprenticeship for work in the leather and tannery industry. In 1918 he joined the German Leather workers' Trades Union and the Spartacus League which shortly thereafter became the German Communist Party (KPD) In 1919 he joined the Young Communists and became a founding member of the regional Communist Party group in W√ºrttemberg and chairman of the KPD in his home town, Oberurbach. He joined the Regional leadership of the W√ºrttemberg Young Communists in 1920. He toi pursue an active political career in the German communist party, which included an extended period in Moscow during 1927/28 attending the International Lenin School. Exile In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi party) took power and lost no time in embarking on the creation of a one party state in Germany. Hermann Nuding was arrested in February 1933 and remained in \\"protective custody\\" till the start of July 1934 when he emigrated initially to Switzerland, subsequently also spending more time in Moscow. In 1935 he participated, using the pseudonym \\"Claus Degeb\\" in the party's Brussels conference and then in 1935/36 worked from his base in Zurich with the illegal Communist Party across the German border in W√ºrttemberg. During the second part of the 1930s he continued to work for the German Communist Party, based for some of the period in Belgium. In 1937 Hermann Nuding and Herbert Wehner were jointly commissioned by the Comintern leadership to compose a diatribe entitled \\"Trotskyism and Fascism\\". Leon Trotsky had at one time been seen by many as a likely successor of Lenin and was, by the 1930s, exiled from the Soviet Union and being systematically excoriated by the Soviet leadership and its supporters internationally. Like many exiled German communists, by the time war broke out in 1939 he was based in France, and during 1939/1940 he was interned at Gurs. On his release he settled down to a life as a small farmer in the south of France using, appropriately, the pseudonym \\"Jean Bauer\\". During the early 1940s he worked illegally with both the French Resistance and the Soviet sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany. Peace breaks out After the war ended Nuding returned, in October 1945, to his home region in what remained of Germany. The northern part of W√ºrttemberg, including Stuttgart was now in the US occupation zone and formed a part of W√ºrttemberg-Baden, a state formed by the occupation forces to accommodate the division of south western German between the US military and the French military. Nuding set about rebuilding the Communist Party in Stuttgart and the surrounding region. In 1946 he became a member of the provisional regional parliament for W√ºrttemberg-Baden and then for its successor assembly, established by the US Military administration. At this point he represented the newly formed SED (party) which had been set up in the Soviet occupation zone, although he would soon revert to the Communist Party when it became apparent that there was no future role for the SED outside that part of Germany controlled by the Soviet military. By 1949 it was becoming apparent that West Germany and East Germany were developing as separate states, and in August 1949 Nuding was one of the fifteen Communist members of the national Bundestag, located provisionally in Bonn. He remained a member till resigning ostensibly on health grounds on 20 April 1951. Until July 1950 he spoke in the chamber on behalf of the Communist party, but by that time his expulsion from the Communist Party had already been proposed back in September 1949 by Walter Ulbricht, the leader of the newly emerging Soviet backed German Democratic Republic. Disgrace and Expulsion from The Party At the end of April 1945 thirty German communists, grouped in three teams of ten, arrived in what was becoming the Soviet occupation zone in Germany. The men, led by Walter Ulbricht, had spent the war years in Moscow: as matters turned, out they had used their years in exile to formulate a clear nation-building program for what would become the German Democratic Republic. German communists who had spent the war somewhere other in the Soviet Union did not necessarily share the objectives or strategy of the Ulbricht Group and during the later 1940s tensions between the Communist Party's leaders in the Bundestag, based in West Germany, and the men now governing East Germany, became increasingly apparent. In June 1950, at the Communist Party's sixteenth party conference, Nuding was condemned as the party's leading opportunist\\"als wichtigster Tr√§ger opportunistischer Auffassungen in unserer Partei\\" and the next month, in July 1950 he was stripped of party functions. It was reported in October 1950 that despite being seriously ill he had rejected an \\"urgent recommendation\\" to relocate to the German Democratic Republic. His resignation from the German Bundestag on health grounds in April 1951 came as the result of an instruction received from the Berlin-based SED (party). The underlying differences that led to his resignation were numerous. Issues that triggered his disgrace by the Communist Party included his rejection of the Communist Party's official opposition to the German Trades Union Confederation (founded in Munich in 1949) and his further rejection of the party line that in the event of a war between the Soviet Union and her (former) western allies, the German Communists should actively support the Soviet Union. More generally, while there was unanimity between Nuding and the German Communist Party in opposing German rearmament in respect of West Germany, Nuding also held that rearmament of East Germany was similarly unacceptable: this was at variance with the strategy of the Ulbricht government and their Soviet backers. Despite his exclusion from his party posts, Hermann Nuding continued to be listed as a party official till May 1955. He was excluded from party membership only on 17 August 1956, although even after this he continued to be consulted by party officials on political and trades union matters. Personal Hermann Nuding was married twice. His first marriage to Paula Kopp lasted from 1923 till 1947. Paula then, in 1947, married Hans Rue√ü, and so is frequently identified in sources as Paula Rue√ü. Hermann Nuding's second marriage to Helene took place in 1957. Neither marriage gave rise to surviving children. Hermann Nuding himself spent his final years in poor health as a pensioner in Luginsland (Stuttgart) where he died in December 1966.

History  The Navy‚Äôs first long range Maritime Reconnaissance squadron was commissioned with five ex IAF Super Constellation aircraft on 8 November 1976. Cdr R D Dhir was the commissioning Squadron Commander. The squadron was originally based at INS Hansa, Goa. The Super Constellation aircraft were phased out in 1983. On 16 April 1988, Tupolev 142M aircraft were commissioned into the squadron by the then Defence Minister KC Pant, at INS Hansa. The Albatross, due to their phenomenal Maritime Reconnaissance (MR) capabilities have been spearheading the Navy‚Äôs MR effort ever since and are among the finest aircraft of their kind in the world in addition to being the fastest turbo-props. With continuous equipment upgrades and integration of new technologies, the Albatross have remained the lead aircraft for long range reconnaissance, ASW and ESM/ EW missions in the Indian Navy. The squadron was shifted to INS Rajali, Arakkonam by April 1992, and has been based there ever since. The first TU142M landed at Rajali on 7 March 1992. On 13 November 2016, India‚Äôs Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar officially inducted the Indian Navy‚Äôs first squadron of Boeing P-8I Poseidon aircraft, designated 312-A, at INS Rajali. The new unit will be permanently based at INS Rajali. The first Commander of this air squadron was Captain Harjeet Singh Jhajj. The unit is presently under the command of Commander Venkateshwaran Ranganathan. ON 29 March 2017, the Tupolev Tu-142M aircraft were decommissioned from the Indian Navy by Admiral Sunil Lanba at a special ceremony at INS Rajali. Commander Yogender Mair who was the last Commanding Officer of the squadron with this aircraft formally handed over the command of the squadron to Commander Venkateshwaran Ranganathan.  Operations  The Tupolev Tu-142M was used in Operation Cactus in Maldives, Operation Vijay in 1998, Operation Parakram in 2002, and in anti-piracy Operations from 2011 until its decommissioning. In January 2016, two P-8I aircraft were deployed for 2 weeks at a military base in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The deployment comes as a response to repeated forays of Chinese conventional and nuclear submarines into the Indian Ocean. On 20‚Äì23 March 2016, a P-8I aircraft was deployed to Seychelles to undertake surveillance of the Seychelles EEZ. This was the first time that the P8I aircraft has been deployed to Seychelles On 15 April 2016, a P-8I aircraft managed to thwart a piracy attack on the high seas by flying over a merchant vessel which was being targeted by a pirate mother-ship and two skiffs around 800 nautical miles from Mumbai. The P-8I was on a routine surveillance mission over the Arabian Sea when it received distress calls from the merchant vessel, the Malta-flagged MV Sezai Selah, on the international Channel 16 distress radio. The pirate mother ship and the two high-speed skiffs had come quite close to the merchant vessel. The P-8I immediately responded and made warning transmissions over Channel 16 while flying over the pirate boats. The pirate boats were frightened and altered course to leave MV Sezai Selah alone. Distinctions INAS 312 was awarded a Unit Citation by the Chief of Naval Staff in 2002 for outstanding professionalism and momentous contribution to the Service. The squadron has won Best Frontline Squadron on numerous occasions. During its operation of the Tu-142M, INAS 312 had distinction of operating the heaviest, fastest and highest flying turbo prop aircraft in the world.

In the treaty, Poland promised to aid France against Brandenburg-Prussia, in exchange for French monetary subsidies and support for Polish claims over Ducal Prussia. The French promised to mediate between Poland and the Ottoman Empire so that Polish forces could be diverted from the southern border. The treaty, however, did not have much effect on European politics, as the French diplomacy failed to improve the relations between the Ottomans and Poland. The 1676 Truce of ≈ªurawno was unfavorable to Poland. France eventually concluded the Treaty of Nijmegen (1679) with Prussia, which cooled its relations with Poland, as Sobieski abandoned his pro-French stance; the Polish-French alliance had fallen apart by 1683 when some of the pro-French faction members were accused of plotting to depose Sobieski, and French ambassador Nicolas- Louis de l'Hospital, Bishop of Beauvais and Marquis of Vitry was forced to leave the country.Red.

In 1298, she was a widow with a 1-year-old child travelling south when she met Thihathu, who was on a hunting trip. Thihathu, who had just founded the Myinsaing Kingdom with his two elder brothers, took her as a concubine. She gave birth to his first male child, Saw Yun, a year later. She remained a concubine until after she gave birth to a daughter, Saw Pale. She was raised to be the Queen of the Northern Palace.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 371‚Äì372 The queen's descendants include kings of Sagaing from Saw Yun to Tarabya II, as well as King Thado Minbya, the founder of Ava Kingdom.See the regnal list of Sagaing in (Harvey 1925: 366).

Published by the University of Madras, it is said to be the most comprehensive dictionary of the Tamil language to date. On the basis of several precursors, including Rottler's Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, and Pope's Compendious Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, work on a more exhaustive dictionary began in January 1913 and the first forms were printed by the end of 1923. Initially estimated at 100,000, the total cost of the project came to about 410,000. The first edition had 4,351 pages in seven volumes, including a one-volume supplement, which were printed between 1924 and 1939 and had 104,405 words, with an additional 13,357 words in the supplementary volume, totaling to 124,405 words in all. The dictionary was reprinted in 1956 and 1982. Work on the revised and expanded edition of the dictionary, being published in twelve volumes, began on 1 May 2003, with the first volume published in 2012 under the vice-chancellorship of K. Thiruvasagam. The revised edition of the dictionary will include words taken from secondary sources like modern and old literary works, newspapers, scientific journals and inscriptions. History Although the origin of the Tamil language dates back to antiquity, the first regular lexicon of the language, with words arranged alphabetically, did not appear until the eighteenth century. Lexicons of the earlier period were not arranged alphabetically but metrically, on the basis of the first-letter rhyme, a characteristic of Tamil poetry. Agaraadhi Nigandu was the first alphabetically arranged lexicon published in 1594. Several dictionaries followed suit, including those by the foreign missionaries, such as Palporut Choolaamani, Podhigai Nigandu, Tamil‚ÄìPortuguese Dictionary of Fr. Antem de Proenca, Dictionarium Tamulicum, Chathur Agaraadhi, Fabricius's Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Manual Dictionary of the Tamil Language (The Jaffna Dictionary), Oru Sor Pala Porul Vilakkam, Rottler's Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Pope's Compendious Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Classical Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Tamil Pocket Dictionary, Tranquebar Dictionary, N. Kadhirvel Pillai's Dictionary, Sangam Dictionary, and Ilakkiya Sol Agaraadhi. When the 67,542-words Winslow's Tamil‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, which was sourced on the unpublished work of Rev. Joseph Night and Rev. Samuel Hutsings, was published in 1862 by the American Mission Press, it was considered the best lexicon available at that time. This dictionary by Miron Winslow was based on the works of Johann Rottler, which itself was inspired from Johann Fabricius's work in the mid-18th century. Winslow was sent out to Jaffna and then transferred to Madras by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. In both the places, he collaborated with Arumuga Navalar. It had the most number of words of any Tamil dictionary up to the time. The copyright of the dictionary was held by the American Ceylon Mission. Soon there was a demand to revise the Winslow dictionary. However, the mission suffered from lack of funds due to the closure of the Arbuthnot Bank. Citing lack of scholars in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), it then sought the help of the Madras branch of the Christian Literature Society. G. U. Pope, upon hearing of these plans, offered to give his collection of material for an exhaustive lexicon of the Tamil language. As he had retired to Oxford to work on the Tamil Classics, he suggested an editor be sent out to Oxford to work with him on the re-issue of Winslow's dictionary. The Government of Madras and the University of Madras reacted positively to Pope's suggestion. However, before any concrete decision could be taken, Pope died in 1907. In 1909, his son came to Madras with his father's papers and gifted them to the Oriental Manuscripts Library, permitting the use of the material for any new Tamil dictionary. In 1910, J. S. Chandler of the American Mission, then residing in Kodaikanal, forwarded a proposal to the Madras government on the new Tamil dictionary project. With the Pope's collection it had, the government reacted to Chandler's proposal in January 1911 by appointing a five-member Lexicon committee comprising a representative each from the government, the university, the Madras Tamil Sangam, and the missionary bodies of Ceylon and South India. Chandler, who was nominated by South Indian missionaries, was appointed chairman of the committee and was asked to work full-time as editor of the project. Detailed discussions took place for the next couple of years, and the University of Madras was made supervisor of the project. The total cost of the project was estimated at 100,000 for a period of five years that the project was expected to take. Work on the project began on 1 January 1919, with the appointment of three pundits, three clerks and two typists. The scholars included a Tamil pundit, a Sanskrit pundit and one familiar with the other Dravidian languages and Urdu. M. Raghava Iyengar of Ramnad, a Tamil scholar, assumed the leader of the team. Incidentally, the Tamil typewriter used for the project, with a keyboard developed by Yost of the American Mission, was the first to be ever used in an office in India. When Chandler retired in 1922 at the age of 80, about 81,000 words had been compiled. Few more words were added soon, and in 1924 the Lexicon went to press. With the University of Madras holding the copyright, the printing of the work was entrusted to the Diocesan Press (now CLS Press), which had earlier printed the Winslow's dictionary as the American Mission Press. In 1926, S. Vaiyapuri Pillai was appointed editor for the project. Further delays resulted in the final volume of the dictionary getting published only in 1936, with Pillai continuing as editor till the project was completed in 1939. In 1939, an additional 20,000 words collected for the Lexicon were published. In 1954, a concise version of the lexicon was published. The dictionary was digitised in 2011. Editions Back cover of the Tamil Lexicon dictionary The first edition of the lexicon was published in 1924, with reprints in 1956 and 1982. In 2012, a revised and enlarged edition was published. The lexicon was digitized on 1 April 2011. Criticism In addition to the delay in publishing, the first volume of the revised and enlarged edition published in 2012 was found to have numerous spelling mistakes, bloopers, and grammatical and typographical errors. A complaint was sent to the Chief Minister's Cell. V. Murugan, one of the members of the expert committee who subsequently resigned, sent a detailed note to the Madras University's Tamil department, listing the errors.

Delbard Nursery was founded by and named after George Delbard, who was breeding fruit trees more than seventy years ago, at his family farm in the area of Malicorne, Allier in central France. Later on, he added roses, dahlias, and other flowers to his breeding work. This business is continued and expanded by his grandson Arnaud Delbard, who is working close with the Institut national de la recherche agronomique which is a French governmental organization, as well as with other international collaboration for global selective breeding. 'Folle courtisane' a cream rose cultivar developed by 'Delbar' in 1988. Apple breeding Delbard was first in France to create a breeding program for disease resistant apple cultivars, located near Commentry, France, it is called \\"Delbard Pepinieres International\\". This is done internationally by screening selections and mutations of seedlings and variations of the domesticated apple, some of which have adapted to resist certain apple diseases. Another approach is to find the resistant genes in certain species of crab apple which is the ancestor of the domesticated apple, and to introduce those desired traits through backcrossing. Altogether, the apples still needs to taste good as well, so this involves years of experiments, tasting and testing to provide a good apple for the consumer, which should be disease resistant and of good flavor, texture and looks. Jean- Paul Reynoird, Delbard‚Äôs research director says, that only about twenty selections out of 2,000 hybrids initiated, will make it till the end. Delbard has a separate program for pear breeding, aiming to combat fireblight. Delbard Jubilee is an apple cultivar developed by Delbard. One of the very special apple cultivars developed by Delbard is the Tentation apple also called DellblushRecent advances in Apple Breeding which is limited for cultivation to New Zealand, Delbard Jubilee and Delbarestivale which has excellent taste in Southern Indiana, USA for a mid season apple. Tissue culture Tissue culture started at Delbard in the early '80s when they began to use fragments of stems and green tissue of certified virus-free mother stock to grow plant material in vitro. The clonal modern approach, is still under the classification of vegetative propagation, hence reproducing true to type. This is used for fruits as well as for flower and roses. In the fruit tree department which itself is producing 300,000 trees annually, two thirds are sold at the retail garden centers directly to the private customers, usually in bonsai containers or pots, and one third is sold for commercial growers. Plants sold for private user needs, which are carefully raised to perfection and already ready to fruit, are usually marked with a \\"W\\". Regenesis Delbard is utilizing to barn new technology called \\"regenesis\\" which involves the use of irradiation to force mutations from tissue culture material in vitro. Then they regenerate a bud from the irradiated cells. This is done with hope to change only a few undesirable characteristics of a plant and preserve its overall combination of traits. As of today this business is producing nursery stock material for commercial growers, as well as for forty retail garden centers. The nursery area covers six hundred hectares, or about 1,500 acres, of sheltered greenhouses and open field plantations.

Overview Diplomatic relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (commonly known as North Korea) and Somalia were formally established on 13 April 1967. This late-1950s to 1960s period was when North Korea had first declared autonomous diplomacy. During the Somali Democratic Republic, relations with North Korea were close, due to shared ideals and geopolitical interests. Both countries formally adhered to anti- imperialism and Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, and were aligned with the Soviet Union in the context of the wider Cold War. The Supreme Revolutionary Council established relations with the DPRK in 1970. President of Somalia Siad Barre made two visits to Pyongyang during his tenure, once in 1971. He then met with Kim Il-sung, and signed a bilateral agreement of technical and economic assistance. Over the following years, military cooperation intensified, with North Korea training and equipping the Somali Armed Forces. Additionally, due to a resentment against Ethiopia over the country's involvement in the Korean War, North Korean advisers trained pro-Somalia guerrilla forces active in the Ethiopian‚ÄìSomali conflict. This changed considerably after the communist Derg came to power in 1974, causing an eventual realignment of Soviet support towards Ethiopia. North Korea followed suit, and provided military aid to Ethiopia against Somalia during the Ethio-Somali War. As of March 2014, North Korea and Somalia still officially maintain diplomatic relations according to the National Committee on North Korea.

His father was a marine engineer who died at sea aboard the steamship Alvo in August 1893. Archie was thereafter raised by his mother in New York City. He graduated at the top of his class from the High School of Commerce in 1911 where he wrote his high school thesis on central banking. Brown Brothers and World War I service Upon graduation from high school, Archie obtained a position as a mailroom clerk and addressograph operator at Brown Brothers. While attending night school at New York University, he was transferred to the Foreign Department and began trading currencies for the bank. After the outbreak of World War I, Lochhead volunteered for duty in the Army. He was selected for the Army Air Corps, then in its infancy, and received his certification as an aviator pilot. He returned to work at Brown Brothers after the war, where he became an expert in foreign exchange, and resumed night classes at New York University. The Chemical Bank and US Treasury In 1920, Lochhead accepted a position at the Chemical Bank in New York. Several years later, he was made the head of the bank‚Äôs Foreign Department. While there, he helped found The Foreign Exchange Club of New York and was elected its President. Henry Morgenthau Jr was appointed Secretary of the Treasury in 1933. However, his lack of financial experience demanded a \\"brain trust\\" of advisers. Lochhead became Technical Assistant to Morgenthau in 1933, hired for his expertise in the field of finance and foreign exchange. Lochhead advised Morgenthau on the nation's domestic and foreign financial operations, and was primarily responsible for setting up the Government's \\"Foreign Exchange Department\\" under the newly established two billion dollar Exchange Stabilization Fund. Working behind the scenes as Director of the fund, Lochhead was given complete control over its day-to-day management to successfully stabilize the external value of the dollar. He operated the fund at a profit, achieved a settlement of all foreign accounts every day, and never allowed the Treasury to become uncollateralized in its temporary holdings of foreign exchange. He kept the dollar stable, and did all the buying for foreign silver under the 1934 Silver Purchase ActUnited States News, October 5, 1936 The fund‚Äôs operations were confidential. The Universal Trading Corporation Lochhead declined an appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1939, resigning from government service to become President of the Universal Trading Corporation in New York. He was succeeded at the Stabilization Fund by H. Merle Cochran. The Universal Trading Corporation was set up to enable mutually profitable trade between the United States and China, and was wholly owned by the Chinese government. Lochhead was hired for his expertise in US business and finance and his long-term relationships with officials in the Chinese banking community. The United States' Import-Export bank had advanced China $25 million in 1938 to buy war supplies in the fight against Japan, with the money to be paid back through sale of strategic goods such as tin and tung oil. The Universal Trading Corporation served as the purchasing agency for the Chinese Nationalist Government for all purchasing requirements for the United States. It was primarily focused on tung oil imports for the United States, one of China‚Äôs most valuable exports at the time, and a primary ingredient in the manufacture of paint in the 1930s and 40s.Fortune Magazine December 1940 Lochhead was awarded the Order of the Jade in 1948, and the Grand Cordon Order of the Brilliant Star in 1960 \\"in recognition of his meritorious services.\\" Lochhead died on January 15, 1971, at the age of 78 at his home in Verona, New Jersey.Staff. \\"Archie Lochhead Is Dead at 78; Banker Led Stabilization Fund\\", The New York Times, January 16, 1971.

Description and history The Anderson Brothers Store is a 1-1/2 story vernacular wood frame structure, with a single-story wing to the north and an attached barn to the rear. The main facade, facing east, has a projecting section with bay windows flanking a recessed entrance, topped by a shallow hip roof. The front-facing gable roof has a large cross gable on the south side, and the wing to the north has a flat roof and false front. The long south side of the building has a second entrance about half way, and several irregularly spaced windows. The barn has a large track-mounted door. The interior of the building features original tongue-and-groove sheathing on the walls and ceiling. The main block of the store was built c. 1901 by John and Lewis Anderson, and was the town's first general store. By 1915, the store had grown, adding the north wing to house the local post office, and with the projecting front section added. The partnership dissolved in 1910, and Lewis Anderson ran the store alone until 1918. The store was thereafter operated by a number of different owners through to the 1950s.

General information and history  Ivan Franko Theater was founded in Vinnytsia in 1920 by some of the actors of the Young Theater, led by Hnat Yura, and the actors of the New Lviv Theater, led by Ambrosiy Buchma. The artists united and created a theater group called Ivan Franko New Drama Theater, headed by Hnat Yura. The theater opening with the play \\"The Sin\\" by Volodymyr Vynnychenko took place on January 28, 1920, and 23 premieres were performed during the season. The repertoire basis of the first seasons was the performances of the Young Theater: \\"Flooded Bell\\" by G. Hauptmann, \\"Molodist\\" by M. Galbe, \\"The King Oedipus\\" by Sophocles. Volodymyr Vynnychenko, having watched the performances of Hnat Yura at the Young Theater, brought him the play \\"The Sin\\" for production. Yura produced the play at the Young Theater, and subsequently it was the opening play at Ivan Franko Theater. By the way, in the first season of the theater's existence, most of the repertoire plays were written by V. Vynnychenko. At the same time, one of the new productions, Beaumarchais's \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\", was prepared. In this case, Yura was a translator, director and lead. Since the premiere on August 27, 1920, this play had constantly been in the repertoire of the Franko Theater for thirteen years. Recalling the founders of Ivan Franko Theater, sometimes they forget that this theater was created by young artists: Hnat Yura was 32 years old, his wife Olha Rubchakivna - 17, Ambrosiy Buchma, Oleksiy Vatulya - 29, Feodosia Barvinska - 22. The theater spent the first years of its existence traveling extensively through the cities and villages of central Ukraine. A conspicuous fact in the struggle for existence was the performance of Hnat Yura at \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" premiere in Vinnytsia, which was attended by the representatives of the Government of the UPR. He stated that not a single theater could exist under the conditions created for Franko Theater, and only craving for work and incredible dedication to the scene saved the theater. At that time, in spite of everyone, Gnat Yura was working on \\"Lorenzacchio\\" by de Musset, the premiere of \\"Sheep's Well\\" by Lope de Vega took place, they kept on rehearsing Lesya Ukrainka's \\"Forest Song\\", and they were still touring... This time the theater went to Donbass. One of the theater's founders, artist Matthew Drak helped a lot as never before. From 1920 to 1949, Gnat Yura and Matthew produced many performances. His talent of the artist, deep knowledge and the sense of theatrical space especially became useful in the extreme conditions of the first decade of the existence of the collective. One can only imagine how and where the actors were traveling through mines, factories and workers' settlements with a repertoire consisting of \\"Forest Song\\", \\"Sheep's Well\\", \\"At the bottom\\", \\"Haydamaky\\" and \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" for six months on the tracks, and even on foot. One of the performances of the play \\"Forest song\\" in Gorlovka was rather peculiar. The play was performed in a huge park, on a bright sunny hot day, without any scenery, the actors were wearing only fabulous stage outfits created by Matthew Drake. However, Donbass tour was the impetus for making Franko Theater the State Theater of the Ukrainian SSR and moving it to the capital of Ukraine, Kharkiv, in 1923. Lesia Ukrainka's \\"Forest song\\", Mykola Gogol's \\"Government Inspector\\", Anatoliy Lunacharsky's \\"The Flames\\", Bernard Shaw's \\"St. John\\", Mykola Kulish \\"97\\" are among the best performances of the theater of those years. In the summer of 1926, Franko Theater was moved to Kyiv by the government decision, while the Berezil Theater moved from Kyiv to Kharkiv. Since 1926, the theater has been operating in the building of the former Solovtsov Theater. In the 1920-1930s, the actor core of the theater was as follows: Ambrosiy Buchma, Natalia Uzhvy, Yuri Shumsky, Anna Borysoglebska, Dmytro Milyuttenko, Victor Dobrovolsky, Polina Njatko, Kateryna Osmylovska, Yevhen Ponomarenko, Petro Sergienko, Mykola Yakovchenko, Mykola Bratersky, Oleksandr Romanenko and others. The following masterpieces of the national and world classics were produced: \\"The Marriage of Figaro‚Äù by Beaumarchais, \\"Adventures of the Bright Soldier Schweik\\" by Gashek, \\"Vanity\\" by I. Karpenko- Kariy, \\"Don Carlos\\" by F. Schiller, \\"Boris Godunov\\" by Pushkin. From the first half of the 1930s, the theater, like a number of other groups, has almost completely switched to propaganda plays of Soviet themes. There was only one classical play among 13 productions staged in 1930‚Äì34. Feeling that the actors and theater could lose what had been developed over the years, in 1933 Hnat Yura turned to one of the most beloved productions that saved the theater during hard times, \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\". He played the part of Figaro. Frequently, neglecting his own interests and desires as a director, trying to expand the creative range of the theater, Yura invited other directors to produce plays: in 1937, Boris Sushkevich produced the tragedy \\"Boris Godunov\\" by Pushkin; in 1939, V. Vilner staged \\"The Last Victim\\" by O. Ostrovsky. In the season of the 20th anniversary of the theater foundation, Yura produced the legendary \\"Stolen Happiness\\" by I. Franko. In 1946, Konstantin Khokhlov revealed the drama of A. Chekhov to the Ukrainian theater, staging \\"Cherry Orchard\\" at Franko Theater. The classics kept on saving the theater from degradation: Yura was working on updated versions of \\"Martin Borulli\\", \\"Auditor\\", \\"Shvejk\\", which had been his mascot since 1928. The monument in the park near the theater immortalizes Gnat Yura's Svejk. 1940 ‚Äì the theater received the academic title. 1941-1944 ‚Äì the company worked, while being evacuated to Semipalatinsk and Tashkent. B. Nord, B. Tyagn, B. Balaban, V. Vasiliev, M. Krushelnytsky, V. Ivchenko, V. Gakkebusch worked at the theater in the postwar period; V. Ogloblin, V. Krainichenko, V. Kharchenko ‚Äì since the 1950s; D. Aleksidze, V. Sklyarenko, D. Lyzogub, B. Meshkis, O. Barseghyan, D. Tchaikovsky, P. Morozenko, S. Korkoshko ‚Äì since the 1960s, S. Smiyan and others ‚Äì since the 1970s. Scenography and music solutions of the plays have traditionally been and remain a strong point of the creative work of Franko Theater. These are the works of the artists: M. Drak, V. Mellear, A. Petrytsky, D. Leader, A. Aleksandrovich-Dochevsky (the main artist of the theater), as well as music by composers: N. Pruslin, Y. Mateus, I. Shamo, I. Post, L. Revutsky, O. Bilash, M. Skoryk and others. In 1978‚Äì2001, the theater was headed by Serhiy Danchenko. At that time, Bohdan Stupka, Bohdan Benyuk, Anatoliy Khostikoyev, Natalya Sumska, Larysa Kadyrova, Les Zadneprovsky, Alexei Bogdanovich, Iryna Doroshenko Vasiliy Mazur, Lyudmila Smorodina, Stanislav Stankevich, Les Serdyuk, Mikhail Kramar and many others were the cast of the theater. \\"Fear of risk leads to averaging out the art. this is a danger, the theater is a living organism, and nothing can be saved by beating about the bush. No manifests are needed, there should be performances. They are the only purpose and means of progress.\\" Serhiy Danchenko followed these words and achieved significant results. The first productions made people talk about the revival of the First Scene of Ukraine. Here he introduced the Ukrainian stage to the drama of F. D√ºrrenmatt, G. Ibsen, introduced the moral and aesthetic circle of the Ukrainian theater to A. Chekhov (in 1980, the performance \\"Uncle Vanya\\" was awarded the State Prize of the USSR), repeatedly appealed to the drama of W. Shakespeare, found proper, nervously penetrating forms of stage reading of Mykola Khvylovy's prose. He captured people with the national theater element of I. Kotlyarevskyi's \\"Aeneis\\". The story of Tevye the Milkman, with which the whole world was familiar, acquired the status of a cosmic narrative about the search for the harmony of being (Tevye-Tevel by Sholem Aleichem 1993 ‚Äì Taras Shevchenko National Prize of Ukraine). Since the early 1990s, the theater has been actively putting its work in the European cultural context ‚Äì it tours in Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy, Poland, the United States, where the work of the Franko Theater artists is appreciated as it's supposed to be. Since 1992 ‚Äì Myhailo Zakharevich has been the CEO of the Theater. The decree of the President of Ukraine dated October 11, 1994, granted the status of the National Theater. From the end of 2001 to 2012 the theater was headed by Hero and People's Artist of Ukraine Bogdan Stupka. Continuing and developing the traditions estqablished by the glorious predecessors ‚Äì the founder of the theater G. Yura and the long-term creative fellow S. Danchenko ‚Äì Bohdan Stupka introduced the names, which were unusual for Ukraine, to the repertoire, including the classics of Ukrainian literature by G. Skovoroda (\\"The Primer of the World\\"), G. Konysky \\"Tragedo Comedy about the Resurrection of the Dead\\"); introduced the ancient Indian culture (\\"Shyakundala\\" by Kalidasi), the work of the Polish classic of the 20th century S. Vitkevich (\\"Mom, or Unspecified Creation ...\\"); brought Sophocles and F. Dostoevsky ( \\"King Oedipus \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\") back on stage. In an effort to expand the artistic palette of Franko Theater, Stupka invited to stage directors with completely opposite artistic principles. Directors from Russia, Poland, Georgia, and Canada co-operated with the theater. The theater becomes a full member of the International Theater Institute, thus contributing to the popularization of Ukrainian theatrical art in the world. \\"And today we have no moral right to cross out, erase from memory everything created by the luminaries of this scene, but on the contrary, we must accomplish what they didn‚Äôt. The future of our theater in 40, 50, 100 years depends on us, on everyone. The way we will be remembered by the coming generation.‚Äù B. Stupka On March 19, 2012, the Chamber Scene, named after Sergyi Danchenko, was opened. On October 19, 2013, the monument of the Artist was erected (Volodymyr and Andriy Chepeliki were the sculptors), near the Chamber Scene During the period from 2012 to 2017, the artistic director of the theater was Stanislav Moiseyev. Today, the general director and artistic director of the theater is Myhailo Zakharevich (since 2018), the principal director is Dmutro Bogomazov (since 2017). Directors Petro Ilchenko, Yuriy Odinoky, Andriy Prykhodko, Dmitry Chiropyuk, David Petrosyan work full-time at the theater. Since 2004, the International Theater Festival of Women's Mono Performances \\"Maria\\" has been held annually in the theater's space. The theater is located in a park area next to the Bankova Street.

Swain laid the foundations of modern forestry economics in Queensland. Early life Edward Harold Fulcher Swain was born in Sydney in 1883. Career Swain was the first Cadet Forester in the New South Wales Forestry Branch in 1899. He studied forestry in Montana, USA in 1915 and on his return became a District Forest Inspector in Queensland. Between 1918 and 1924 he was Director of Forests in Queensland. During this time he set aside large tracts of hoop pine forest in the Brisbane Valley and Mary River Valley and planted areas of introduced species. On the abolition of the office of Director in 1924, he became inaugural Chairman of the Queensland Forestry Board until 1932. This Board was responsible for the management and control of the State Forests and National Parks. Swain laid the foundations of modern forestry economics in Queensland. His new ideas and strong personality frequently brought him into conflict with others and he was often a controversial figure in an industry deeply rooted in traditional practice. Amongst other achievements, he pioneered forest assessment surveys, promoted the permanent reservation of good forests and forest land, improved pricing policies which led to a better use of timber resources and expanded staff training and the activities of his department. He wrote a number of books on forestry, was a founder of the Australian Forestry School at the Australian National University and supported community interest in trees. In 1924, he was instrumental in establishing the Sherwood Arboretum, a heritage-listed park on the Brisbane River, which is dedicated to the growth of indigenous trees. In 1932, Swain publicly campaigned against the indiscriminate allocation of forested land as land grants, at the time a policy of the incumbent National Party Government. Although the Labor Party won the election, in the controversy and inquiries which followed Swain lost his job. He became a research consultant for Australian Paper Manufacturers in South Australia before becoming Commissioner for Forests in New South Wales until his official retirement in 1948. Between 1951 and 1955 he was United Nations Forestry Consultant in Ethiopia. House Edward Swain purchased the 1.5 acres of riverfront land for Swain House in 1920 when he was Director of Forests in Queensland. He took out a mortgage for ¬£1,300 and constructed a California Bungalow style home in which he was living by 1925. He surrounded the house with extensive plantings of native and exotic trees reflecting his life's work in forestry. Swain House is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. His daughter Nancy and her husband occupied the family home from 1946. She shared her father's interest in indigenous species and planted rainforest trees in the grounds. The house itself reflects Swain's obsession with exploring the potential of Australian timbers. It was constructed of rosewood with the intention of proving that this timber, then not well regarded for the purpose, was suitable for building. The house also displays Queensland timbers to advantage, the joinery including panelling in pine and kauri. Later life Swain died in Brisbane in July 1970. Legacy Most of the trees planted by Swain and his family survive and are now large trees that make a major contribution to the landscape of the area. The Alan Fletcher Research Station of the Department of Primary Industries nearby uses the hoop pine plantation for research into forestry practices.

Research Thompson extended David Gabai's concept of thin position from knots to 3-manifolds and Heegaard splittings.. Education reform Thompson has also been an activist for reform of primary and secondary school mathematics education. She has publicly attacked the Mathland-based curriculum in use in the mid-1990s when the oldest of her three children began studying mathematics in school, claiming that it provided an inadequate foundation in basic mathematical skills, left no opportunity for independent work, and was based on poorly written materials. As an alternative, she founded a program at UC Davis to improve teacher knowledge of mathematics, and became the director of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, a month- long summer mathematics camp for high school students.

The front lower arms have been revised with more material added to the area surrounding the hinge pin for increased durability. The MBX7TR also abandoned the rebuild-able CVD style shafts in favor of universal style driveshafts and now also shares the same trailing style front hub carrier and ackermann plate as the MBX7R buggy. The front steering and geometry changes are intended to increase the truck's steering and the total number of steering adjustments available. MBX8 The \\"MBX8\\" was introduced on 11/12/2017 on their Facebook page. Adam Drake says that the NEW MBX8 has a lot to offer! More durable, more acceleration, more runtime, easier to work on, and lightweight. The new Mugen Seiki MBX8 buggy has been put to the tested and develop by him and other best drivers in the world. Here's a look at some of the new features for the Mugen Seiki MBX8. Chassis: -The MBX8 chassis features a new design that improves traction and stability in bumpy conditions and on the exit of corners. The steering post are also keyed into the MBX8 chassis for easier maintenance. Differential and drivetrain: -High Traction Differentials are included in the MBX8. The Mugen Seiki HTD provides increased acceleration, longer runtime, and more consistent handling. The HTD's also increase stability, traction and improve handling in bumpy conditions. The HTD has a new larger volume diff cup to increase consistency during long main events. This makes it easier to time rhythm sections, better in bumpy and low grip conditions, helps to increase traction, and increases fuel mileage. \\\\- New straight cut 13T bevel gear and 44T conical gear. The new straight cut bevel and conical gears increase acceleration, runtime, and efficiency. A free and efficient drivetrain will also increase speeds while cornering. Lightweight one-piece wing mount. -The new lightweight one-piece wing mount lower the center of gravity. The position of the wing and wing mount is optimized to improve the performance of vehicle. The height of the wing mount is adjustable. This allows you to control the down force on the rear of the vehicle by simply raising or lowering the mount on the shock tower. -Lightweight high down-force wing. The new IFMAR legal wing is lightweight and provides amazing down force and corning. The underside of the wing uses a new design to reduced weight and creates additional down-force.

He graduated in 1963 with a degree in English education, and later earned two master's degrees from the University of Hartford (Education, 1970) and Hartford's Trinity College (English, 1972), as well as a Ph.D. (1976) in linguistics from the University of Florida in Gainesville.author entry, Baseball Reference.com In the 1960s and early 1970s, Bjarkman served as a secondary school English teacher and track and field coach in Connecticut (Wethersfield High School), and also taught English at American bi-national schools in Bucaramanga, Colombia (1968‚Äì1969), and Guayaquil, Ecuador (1971‚Äì1972).\\"Peter Bjarkman‚Äîaka Dr. Baseball\\" (by Robert Cannon) in Sports Collectors Digest 20:16 (April 16, 1993), 174‚Äì177. After completing his doctorate, which included a specialization in Spanish linguistics, he pursued a university teaching career from 1976 to 1987 that included faculty positions at George Mason University (Fairfax, Virginia), Butler University (Indianapolis), Ball State University (Muncie, Indiana), the University of Colorado (Boulder), and Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana). Since the early 1980s, Bjarkman had resided in Lafayette, Indiana. His extensive travels during the past three decades involved numerous visits and extended stays in Eastern Europe (especially Croatia) and Cuba (more than three dozen visits since 1997), plus travels to Asia (Japan), Latin America (especially the Caribbean), and much of Western and Eastern Europe. Writing career Beginning a freelance writing career in the late 1980s, Bjarkman authored more than twenty books on baseball and basketball history, including Major League Baseball team histories, young adult sports biographies, baseball and basketball coffee table picture books, and several ground-breaking academic histories of baseball played in Latin America and Cuba.\\"¬°Viva el B√©isbol! From Professor of Linguistics to Cuban Baseball Expert\\" (Bjarkman Profile in 9 to 5, Act II: Alumni Tell Us How Their Career Paths Have Diverged) in: Observer: The Magazine of the University of Hartford, Spring 2010, 22. Beginning in June 2007 he provided online essays and analysis of Cuban League games, plus regular online and print coverage of the Cuban national team during its numerous international baseball tournament appearances.\\"Bjarkman's Latino and Cuban Baseball History Page\\" (Bjarkman's MLB-hosted baseball blog. The acceptance of Bjarkman as an acknowledged authority on post-1962 Cuban baseball led to numerous electronic and print media appearances and interviews. Notable among these were several featured interviews on ESPN's \\"Outside the Lines\\" with Bob Ley; an appearance in the ESPN Films award- winning \\"30 for 30\\" documentary \\"Brothers in Exile\\"; the MLB Network 2016 documentary \\"Cuba: Island of Baseball\\"; and a central on-camera role in the Travel Channel's airing of Anthony Bourdain's \\"No Reservations Cuba\\" (first shown in July 2011).Tim Brouk (June 13, 2011), \\"No Reservations on Cuba baseball for author\\", The Lafayette Journal & Courier (Lafayette, Indiana), A8. Bjarkman's extensive connections with Cuban baseball and his unique access to leading baseball figures on the Communist island nation were also highlighted in a November 2010 front-page feature story in The Wall Street Journal. His final book, Cuba's Baseball Defectors: The Inside Story (Rowman and Littlefield, 2016), details the history of top Cuban league stars abandoning their homeland for the promise of riches in North American professional baseball, while also recounting Major League Baseball's alleged implicit sanctioning of human trafficking involving recent generations of Cuban baseball stars.

It is an extension of the variational Monte Carlo method, in which a time-dependent pure quantum state is encoded by some variational wave function, generally parametrized as : \\\\Psi(X,t) = \\\\exp \\\\left ( \\\\sum_k a_k(t) O_k(X) \\\\right ) where the complex- valued a_k(t) are time-dependent variational parameters, X denotes a many- body configuration and O_k(X) are time-independent operators that define the specific ansatz. The time evolution of the parameters a_k(t) can be found upon imposing a variational principle to the wave function. In particular one can show that the optimal parameters for the evolution satisfy at each time the equation of motion : i \\\\sum_{k^{\\\\prime}}\\\\langle O_k O_{k^{\\\\prime}}\\\\rangle_t^c \\\\dot{a}_{k^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\langle O_k \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\rangle_t^c, where \\\\mathcal{H} is the Hamiltonian of the system, \\\\langle AB \\\\rangle_t^c=\\\\langle AB\\\\rangle_t-\\\\langle A\\\\rangle_t\\\\langle B\\\\rangle_t are connected averages, and the quantum expectation values are taken over the time-dependent variational wave function, i.e., \\\\langle\\\\cdots\\\\rangle_t \\\\equiv\\\\langle\\\\Psi(t)|\\\\cdots|\\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle . In analogy with the Variational Monte Carlo approach and following the Monte Carlo method for evaluating integrals, we can interpret \\\\frac{ \\\\Psi(X,t) ^2 } { \\\\int \\\\Psi(X,t) ^2 \\\\, dX } as a probability distribution function over the multi- dimensional space spanned by the many-body configurations X . The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm is then used to sample exactly from this probability distribution and, at each time t , the quantities entering the equation of motion are evaluated as statistical averages over the sampled configurations. The trajectories a(t) of the variational parameters are then found upon numerical integration of the associated differential equation.

During World War II, he was a platoon commander. Kharchenko was promoted to the rank of Junior lieutenant in 1939, lieutenant in 1943 and senior lieutenant in 1944. He reportedly personally defused more than 50,000 explosives, including bombs, mines, and shells. For his actions in defusing explosives, Kharchenko was named a Hero of the Soviet Union and awarded the Gold Star and Order of Lenin on 2 November 1944. In the citation for the Hero of the Soviet Union award, it was stated that Kharchenko personally defused more than 1500 bombs weighing more than 500 kilograms each and 25,000 other explosive objects. After World War II, Kharchenko continued his military service until retirement in 1964. Until 1956 he was personally engaged in rendering innocuous explosive items left over from World War II. In March 1961, the battalion commanded by Kharchenko led a rescue operation after the Kurenivka mudslide in Kiev.  Early life  Ivan Kharchenko was born on 23 September 1918 in Komarovka village of Nizhyn Uyezd in the Chernigov Governorate to the family of a peasant. He graduated from seven classes and worked as a factory carpenter in Khimki. In 1938, Kharchenko joined the Red Army  World War II  In 1941 Kharchenko became underleitenant and a platoon commander in the 22 Detached Engineering and anti-gas battalion of Local Anti-Aircraft Defence troops. In 1942 he came back to the unit where he had served in non-commitioned positions -- to the 6th Engineering and anti-gas regiment of the NKVD antiaircraft defense troops. He helped to defuse more than 26,000 German shells, mines and bombs during the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kiev (1943). On 2 November 1944, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his actions in defusing unexploded ordnance and mines.  Postwar  After the end of World War II, Kharchenko defused more than 16,000 unexploded bombs, as well as other explosive devices. In 1950, he graduated from the High Officers' Engineering School in Moscow. In 1964, Kharchenko left military service and worked in the Ministry of Assembly and Special Construction Works in Kiev until his retirement in 1986. He died on 1 July 1989 and is buried in the Berkovetskaya Cemetery.

While Equatorial Guinea has no representation in North Korea, it is one of few African states to have a North Korean embassy, located in the capital of Malabo. Diplomatic relations between the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, commonly known as North Korea) were established in 1969, a year after Equatoguinean independence from Spain. The country's first leader, soon-to-be President-for-Life Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema, would come to lead one of the most brutal regimes on the African continent. Despite his anti-communism, he maintained close relations with the Soviet Union and various pro-Soviet states, North Korea being prominent among them. Like the Zairian regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, the DPRK favoured Mac√≠as Nguema regardless of his ideological opposition to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. During the early 1970s Equatorial Guinea signed military, technical and economic agreements with many socialist states, among others North Korea. Troops from the Korean People's Army were also sent as advisers to the Armed Forces of Equatorial Guinea. Under inspiration from the Workers' Party of Korea, the sole legal party in the country was renamed from \\"United National Party\\" to \\"United National Workers' Party\\" in July 1971. After Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema was overthrown and executed by his nephew Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in 1979, his family fled to Pyongyang, where his three children were raised by the North Korean government. One of them, Monique, left the DPRK in 1994 after fifteen years. In 2013 she published her memoirs, entitled \\"I'm Monique, From Pyongyang\\". Despite this, close relations continued after the coup, and remain active. In 2011 Yang Hyong-sop, Vice President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, made a four-day visit to Equatorial Guinea. In 2013 President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the world's second longest-ruling non-royal head of state after Paul Biya of Cameroon and one of the richest leaders in the world, was presented the \\"First International Kim Jong-il Award\\" by a North Korean delegation. In 2016, Kim Yong-nam of North Korea visited Equatorial Guinea and held amicable talks with President Teodoro Obiang. In 2018, Equatorial Guinea reported that it had severed economic ties with North Korea and repatriated North Korean workers in line with United Nations sanctions.

Several popular Ford products were manufactured there, such as the Ford Mustang, Ford Ranger, and the Ford Pinto. When the plant opened, it manufactured the new Mercury branded and Lincoln vehicles. It was one of three Ford manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and was built two years before the Mahwah Assembly plant was opened in 1950. The plant produced 6.9 million vehicles in total; switching to compact car assembly in the 1960s, it built the Ford Falcon and Mustang and the related Mercury Comet, and then to subcompact cars in 1972 with the Ford Pinto and Mercury Bobcat and later their Escort and Lynx successors. Production shifted to Ranger pickups in 1990, and produced 1.7 million Rangers along with the related Mazda B-Series. It was one of only three locations where Ford manufactured the Mustang; the other sites were Dearborn Assembly and Milpitas Assembly in San Jose, California.

The subject of anger is treated in a range of Jewish sources, from the Bible and Talmud, to Halacha, Kabbalah, Hasidism and contemporary Jewish sources. In Tanach In the Book of Genesis, Jacob condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: \\"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.\\"Kaufmann Kohler, Anger, Jewish Encyclopedia. Some bible commentators point to God's punishment of Moses, not allowing him to enter the land of Israel, as being due to Moses's anger at the Jewish People.Rubin, Yissachar Ber. Talelei Oros: Devarim: The Parsha Anthology. Fledheim Publishers. Accessed December 23, 2014. This anger caused Moses to forget the word of G-d, curse the Israelites, and ultimately bring death on himself. In Talmud Restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as Ethics of the Fathers states: \\"Ben Zoma said: Who is strong? He who subdues his evil inclination, as it is stated, 'He who is slow to anger is better than a strong man, and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city' (Proverbs 16:32).\\"Ethics of the Fathers. 4:1. Elsewhere, \\"Rabbi Eliezer says... Do not be easy to anger.\\"Ethics of the Fathers. 2:10. The Talmud also emphasizes the negative effect anger has on a person. The Talmud links anger to conceit, stating ‚ÄúOne who is angry does not even consider the presence of Hashem important.\\"\\"Tractate Nedarim.\\" Talmud. 22b. In Halacha In its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried in his Kitzur Shulchan Aruch states: \\"Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry.\\"Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried. Kitzur Shulchan Aruch. 29:4. In Kabbalah Rabbi Chaim Vital taught in the name of his master, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the Arizal, that anger may be dispelled by immersing in a ritual bath (mikvah) twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. While immersing, one should meditate on the idea that the numerical value (gematria) of the Hebrew word \\"mikvah\\" () (ritual bath) is the same as the Hebrew word for anger (\\"ka'as, ).Rabbi Chaim Vital, \\"Remedy #15.\\" Shaar Ruach HaKodesh. p. 18b.Mikvah is the numerical value of 151, ka'as is 150 plus the colel (a common gematria formula to add the value of 1 for the word itself). See, Wisnefsky, Moshe Yaakov. \\"Anger Remedy Number 2.\\" Chabad.org. Accessed December 23, 2014. In Hasidism The Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, taught that anger may dispelled by the emphasis on love for God and joy in performing the commandments.Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov. Sefer Baal Shem Tov. Colel Bais Yosef. Melbourne: Australia. 2008. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi interprets the parallel between anger and idol worship stems from the feelings of the one who has become angry typically coincides with a disregard of Divine Providence ‚Äì whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from God ‚Äì through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of God in one's life.Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi. Sefer HaTanya. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. p. 535. Contemporary Judaism Rabbi Harold Kushner finds no grounds for anger toward God because ‚Äúour misfortunes are none of His doing.‚ÄùHarold S. Kushner, When Bad Things Happen to Good People (Schocken Books, 1981), 44. In contrast to Kushner‚Äôs reading of the Bible, David Blumenthal finds an ‚Äúabusing God‚Äù whose ‚Äúsometimes evil‚Äù actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester‚Äôs relationship with God. In a teaching attributed to Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, when anger is a mode of life or when expressed in an unjustified manner, is prohibited by Judaism. But if a person is wronged, he or she is allowed to express their natural feelings, including anger.Hoffman, Seymour. Mental Health, Psychotherapy and Judaism Mondial. 2011.

It was primarily aimed at police stations in Glina and Kozibrod, as well as police- held positions in a string of villages between the town of Dvor and Kozibrod. In addition to Glina and Kozibrod, heavy fighting took place in the village of Struga, north of Dvor, where Croatian Serb forces employed a human shield consisting of Croat civilians taken from their homes in Struga and the nearby village of Zamlaƒça. The Croatian Serb rebels captured the police station in Glina, but were stopped in Struga before the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) arrived there to create a buffer zone and, according to the JNA, assist the Croatian police to evacuate. On 29 July, as the non-Serb civilian population left Kozibrod and the villages to the south of it, the police station in Kozibrod was evacuated as well. The fighting resulted the bulk of the region being transferred to Croatian Serb and JNA control. In the aftermath of the fighting, a number of Croatian Serb troops threatened the regional commander in Dvor, blaming him for the deaths of members of their unit in the fighting. Afterwards, they killed several Croat civilians who were undergoing treatment at the Dvor medical centre. Croatian authorities filed war crime charges against Dragan Vasiljkoviƒá, specifically for leading the attack in Glina which resulted in civilian deaths, as well as injuring and killing prisoners of war. Vasiljkoviƒá was arrested in Australia in 2006, and he is awaiting extradition to Croatia. Background In 1990, ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( ‚Äì HDZ). The Yugoslav People's Army ( ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence ( ‚Äì TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin (approximately north-east of Split), parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. In January 1991, Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces. The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency. Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies, the JNA request was refused on 15 March. Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milo≈°eviƒá's control. By the end of March, the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia. These were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions. At the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. To bolster its defence, Croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20,000. The most effective part of the Croatian police force was 3,000-strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines. There were also 9,000‚Äì10,000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but they lacked weapons. In response to the deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard ( ‚Äì ZNG) in May by expanding the special police battalions into four all-professional guards brigades. Under Ministry of Defence control and commanded by retired JNA General Martin ≈†pegelj, the four guards brigades comprised approximately 8,000 troops. The reserve police, also expanded to 40,000, was attached to the ZNG and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully equipped with small arms; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above the brigade level. The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to using World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios. At the time, the Croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad and 15,000 previously owned by the police. To replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades, a new 10,000-strong special police was established. Prelude In June, the conflict escalated in the region of Banovina, which had been declared a part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina) by that time. Three municipalities in the region‚ÄîDvor, Glina and Hrvatska Kostajnica‚Äîhad predominantly Serb populations, although all of them were inhabited by a substantial number of non-Serbs as well. On 24 June, the Sisak police administration set up a new police station in the village of Kozibrod in the Una River valley, along the Dvor‚ÄìHrvatska Kostajnica road. It was manned by two platoons of police and ZNG troops drawn from the Sisak company of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The new station drew a strong reaction from the SAO Krajina authorities, who issued an ultimatum on the same day the police station was set up, demanded its removal and threatened to remove it by force unless Croatia complied with their ultimatum. On the night of 25/26 June, SAO Krajina forces took control of the police station in Dvor and attacked the police station in Glina. The rebels managed to capture the police station in Glina for less than an hour before they were pushed back by the Luƒçko Anti-Terrorist Unit and police reinforcements deployed from Sisak. Croatian police casualties amounted to one killed and six wounded. Even though the attack in Glina did not leave SAO Krajina in control of the police station in Glina, 16 Croatian policemen were captured and held hostage. The prisoners were taken to the Knin camp and a detention facility in Golubiƒá. In response to the fighting, the JNA deployed its troops to the two towns. New fighting erupted the same day near Hrvatska Kostajnica. In the final days of June, many Serb civilians, especially from Dvor, fled to the area of Bosanski Novi for safety. By 28 June, only a few women, children and the elderly remained in Glina. The town's shops were closed and its streets were patrolled by JNA armoured vehicles. After the fighting, the JNA positioned its troops around the police station, while the Croatian Serb rebels controlled the rest of the town. In mid-July, Dragan Vasiljkoviƒá was deployed from the Croatian Serb capital Knin to Banovina to coordinate rebel forces there. By 21 July, his work was commended by local commanders, and two days later, a regional command of Croatian Serb forces was announced at a meeting in Dvor attended by Milan Martiƒá, one of the most prominent SAO Krajina leaders. On 24 July, one day after the regional command was established, the Serb rebels adopted a military plan, presented by Vasiljkoviƒá, aimed at removing Croatian forces from Banovina. On 25 July, 14 mortar rounds were fired at the Kozibrod police station. Nobody was injured in the attack, and in its aftermath, SAO Krajina authorities requested a ceasefire until 10 August because of the harvest. Timeline The offensive, codenamed Operation Stinger () was primarily aimed at the Croat-populated villages between Dvor and Hrvatska Kostajnica, and the police station in the town of Glina. The forces earmarked for the offensive were elements of the 7th Banija Division of the SAO Krajina TO, spearheaded by special police deployed from Knin and commanded by Vasiljkoviƒá. The operation commenced on 26 July at 10:00 with an hour-long mortar bombardment of Glina, Kostajnica and Topusko. Vasiljkoviƒá set up his headquarters in the ≈†amarica area of Zrinska Gora, situated between Glina, Dvor, Hrvatska Kostajnica and Petrinja. Glina The ground offensive in Glina commenced with a single SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station. This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe that they were being fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at the police station. The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene. Following consultations with Vasiljkoviƒá, the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards Vidu≈°evac, where they shot at a number of civilian buildings including a school and a church, before turning to approach the police station from a different direction. The assault, supported by mortar fire, continued until the following day. The police station was captured on 27 July at 11:08. According to SAO Krajina military reports, 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting. Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others, as well as the deaths of two civilians, including a German journalist killed by sniper fire. The killed journalist, Egon Scotland, a reporter of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a clearly marked car, when he was fatally wounded. The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers managed to pull out of Glina to Vidu≈°evac. Una River valley Map of the Una River valley from Dvor to Kozibrod; The purple line bisecting the map represents the international border between Croatia (left) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (right) The advance against Croat- held villages along the Una was also preceded by an hour-long mortar bombardment of the area. More than 250 rounds were fired, commencing on 26 July at 10:00, after which the infantry was ordered to advance. The attacking force consisted of 50 SAO Krajina special forces troops drawn from Knin, 50 policemen and 700 conscripts. The JNA estimated that there were about 240‚Äì280 Croatian police and ZNG personnel deployed in the area from Struga to Kozibrod. The SAO Krajina plan saw a battalion led by Braco Orloviƒá advancing north from Dvor through the village of Zamlaƒça to approach the village of Struga. Once there, it was to maintain its position and advance gradually if possible. Additional forces were meant to outflank and pin down the Croatian defending force: a platoon of special forces led by Nikola Sundaƒá, reinforced by a platoon of conscripts, was tasked with bypassing Struga and interdicting traffic along the road between the village of Unƒçani and Struga, preventing any access from the direction of Kozibrod. Another special forces platoon led by ≈Ωeljko Sanader was tasked with seizing the villages of Volinja and Kuljani before advancing towards Kozibrod, while the second battalion attached to the attacking force‚Äîled by Miƒáo Popoviƒá‚Äîengaged Croatian troops near Divu≈°a, Golubovac Divu≈°ki and Kozibrod. After Orloviƒá's battalion entered the undefended village of Zamlaƒça, the Serb rebels moved from one house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found to move to the main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundaƒá. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlaƒça. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure how to deal with the situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlaƒça to the centre of Struga. The armed vehicle and the soldiers following the human shield were ambushed in the centre of Struga by a single policeman and a civilian who threw a hand grenade and ran towards the vehicle, carrying three more hand grenades strapped to his waist. As the hand grenades exploded, gunfire erupted allowing the civilians held as human shields to run away. The policeman and civilian who carried out the ambush were both killed; sources identify the two as reserve policeman Mile Bla≈æeviƒá and traffic policeman ≈Ωeljko Filipoviƒá. Shortly before 16:00, the Croatian forces counterattacked, causing the bulk of Popoviƒá's troops to flee. Popoviƒá and his remaining five or six soldiers retreated. At least five SAO Krajina troops were killed and twenty wounded in fighting in Struga. By 18:00, the battalion led by Orloviƒá had lost 80 percent of its personnel to desertion. Prompted by the desertions and heavy shooting in Struga at 19:00, Bogdan Vajagiƒá, the commanding officer of the SAO Krajina units subordinated to the Dvor headquarters, requested that the JNA intervene. The JNA informed Vajagiƒá that a unit was dispatched from Petrinja, allowing him to break off further fighting with the Croatian police and send two platoons as reinforcements to Glina as reinforcements at Vasiljkoviƒá's request. JNA tanks reached Struga at 19:50 to establish a buffer zone. Croatian forces there offered to leave the village if the JNA provided them with one armoured personnel carrier and escorted them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. The JNA complied with the request. During the fighting, 12 Croatian policemen were killed, along with 20 civilians. Aftermath Fighting continued around Topusko, which was besieged by the Serb rebels on 28 July. The same day, heavy fighting also erupted near Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica. In Dvor, Sundaƒá and several soldiers from his platoon arrived at the regional SAO Krajina military headquarters threatening the commanding officer, holding him responsible for losses the platoon had suffered in the fighting. The group also demanded that the authorities turn any prisoners over to them, but the demand was refused. Finally, they went to the medical centre in Dvor, where they forced eight wounded Croat civilians and two policemen, out of the building and beat them in front of 100 onlookers. There are conflicting reports that all ten were killed, or that only an unspecified number of female patients were killed. On 29 July, the remaining Croatian civilian population in Struga, Unƒçani, Divu≈°a and Golubovac Divu≈°ki accepted an offer made by the JNA to evacuate them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. When the column of evacuating civilians reached Kozibrod, the population of that village also joined them, followed by the police and ZNG troops stationed in Kozibrod. The move left the SAO Krajina and the JNA in control of the bulk of Banovina. Further combat Fighting in the region flared once more on 7 August, with new clashes around Hrvatska Kostajnica and an artillery bombardment of Topusko. On 14 August, the policemen captured in the first attack against the police station in Glina in June were released in a prisoner exchange. Croatian troops and positions held in Hrvatska Kostajnica, as well as in Petrinja and Sisak, were inspected by Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman on 25 August. The Croatian position in the region deteriorated further on 9 September when Hrvatska Kostajnica was besieged. Three days later, SAO Krajina forces captured the hill that commanded the town, and the Croatian forces started a breakout from Hrvatska Kostajnica. On 13 September, Hrvatska Kostajnica was captured by SAO Krajina forces, after heavy attacks supported by JNA artillery and tanks forced approximately 300 Croatian troops to retreat or surrender. The capture of the town was followed by killings, looting and torching of buildings in the town and the surrounding villages. A total of 67 Croatian troops were captured in the town and shipped to the jail in Glina, but none arrived. The SAO Krajina forces captured Hrvatska Dubica the same day, and of Topusko on 14 September. On 21 September, Petrinja was captured by SAO Krajina forces and the JNA, denying Croatia an important bridgehead on the south (right) bank of the Kupa River. The town's capture came approximately one month after Martiƒá announced SAO Krajina's plans to control it. By the end of the month, the Serb rebels and the JNA controlled nearly all of the southern bank of the river, and the lines of control in the region largely stabilised. Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992, which implemented the Vance plan, the Serb rebels and the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to push back the Croatian forces in the region. These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA‚Äîin the area of Slana and Novi Farka≈°iƒá on 17‚Äì18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November. In the same period, the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation Whirlwind to recapture Glina on 11‚Äì13 December. The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution, culminating in the Baƒáin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October, and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November. Charges of war crimes Dragan Vasiljkoviƒá (centre) pictured in 2005 in Belgrade According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the ≈†ibenik County Court ordered that a warrant be issued for Vasiljkoviƒá's arrest. The offences listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter are related to his role in the attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljkoviƒá was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljkoviƒá was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljkoviƒá appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljkoviƒá appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision. In 1994, Croatian authorities tried ƒêuro ƒêuriƒá, a former SAO Krajina policeman, in absentia on charges of war crimes committed in Struga, Zamlaƒça and Kozibrod. He was convicted and sentenced to twenty years in prison. ƒêuriƒá surrendered to the Croatian police at the border crossing in Dvor in 2001. After two months in custody, he was released and left the country. ƒêuriƒá returned to Croatia in February 2009, when he was arrested once again on identical charges. One month later, he was released after witnesses were questioned and failed to link him to the war crimes of which he was accused. War reporting legacy Scotland travelled to the region to investigate the disappearance of a fellow journalist who was thought to have been detained by Croatian Serb forces and assist her. His death in the line of duty, while seeking to help a fellow reporter, had a significant impact on the German media and German public opinion. Scotland's death reinforced the image of the conflict as a real war where no rules were obeyed. Spurred on by his death, Munich-based journalists established the \\"Journalists help Journalists\\" () association in 1993 to help reporters the way Scotland had intended when he was killed. Scotland's death also provided the impetus to establish German section of Reporters Without Borders in 1994.

In addition to the eponymous Vrbanja River, the natural resources of the settlement include the numerous natural springs of drinking water that are found in the surrounding hills.  History After the history of Medieval Bosnia and the earlier period, it can be concluded that in this area, there was a very old village. It was located about 500 meters north of the present-day village. The tradition which has been preserved among today's population suggest that the former settlement was organized on the principle of rural cooperatives. The main activity of the Vrbanja's population in the past was agriculture. Since the mid-twentieth century, many residents were employed in the Banja Luka industry, but agriculture remained the main activity.Handan S.

The inhabitants were killed and expelled, the estates occupied local and newcoming Serbs. However, the return of Bosniaks in Vrbanja is one of the most successful projects of repatriation in Bosanska Krajina.

Micombero, a Tutsi African socialist aligned with China, initially maintained a close relationship with North Korea. It was eventually strained in 1971 by alleged undermining against his military rule carried out by North Koreans among the youth members of the Union for National Progress (UPRONA).

Despite this issue, North Korea aided Micombero's Tutsi regime during the Hutu uprising that broke out in 1972 the resulting genocidal violence and the deaths of 150,000 Hutus. Together with China and France, North Korea provided military support during the unrest. In the years after this, the relationship improved. In 1976, Micombero promised full support to the policies of Kim Il-sung. He was overthrown the same year.

After the Min army officer Li Renda rebelled against Min's last emperor Wang Yanzheng and took over control of Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), he proclaimed Zhuo Yanming, who was respected by the people, emperor, but shortly after assassinated Zhuo and directly took control.  Background  It is not known when Zhuo Yanming, who was born with the name of Zhuo Yansi, was born, but it is known that he was from Putian (ËéÜÁî∞, in modern Putian, Fujian). At some point, he took tonsure and became a Buddhist monk with the dharma name of Timing ‚Äî at either Shenguang Temple () (per the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms)Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 98. or Xuefeng Temple () (per the Zizhi Tongjian), near the Min traditional capital Fu Prefecture. While being a monk, he became respected by the populace. In 945, Li Renda, leading a revolt against the Min emperor Wang Yanzheng (whose capital was at that point at Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), not at Fu), killed Wang Yanzheng's nephew Wang Jichang, whom he had left in command at Fu, and Wang Jichang's assistant general Wu Chengyi (), seizing control of Fu. Li considered formally taking over himself, but believed that the people might not sufficiently be in agreement with him. Instead, knowing that the people respected Timing, he proclaimed, \\"This monk has multiple pupils, and has arms reaching below his knees. These are signs of a true Son of Heaven.\\" He proclaimed Timing emperor and put imperial robes on him ‚Äî yet simultaneously, having the regime use the era name of Later Jin and sending emissaries to Later Jin to pledge loyalty.  Brief reign  Upon assuming the throne, Timing took back his surname of Zhuo and took a new name of Yanming. He also welcomed his father from Putian and honored his father as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). Wang Yanzheng immediately launched an army commanded by the general Zhang Hanzhen () against Zhuo's regime, along with supplements from Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) and Quan (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) Prefectures, which were loyal to him. It was said that Zhuo had no strategies to speak of other than trying to employ magic within the palace. Zhang Hanzhen, however, was defeated by Zhuo's general Huang Renfeng (), captured, and executed. Upon defeating Zhang, Li Renda took over command of the imperial guards, and shortly after had others accuse Huang and Chen Jixun () of treason and killed them, consolidating the military command in his hands. Not long after, he held a grand review of the troops and had Zhuo attend to view them. At the review, he had a soldier assassinate Zhuo. Zhuo's father was also put to death.

It was designed and built by William Busby in 1903. It is also known as Hemmant Boer War Memorial. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Anning Monument was unveiled on 14 March 1903 by Colonel Thomas Price. It was designed and executed by monumental mason William Busby of Toowong, Brisbane. The stone memorial honours local man, Lance Corporal John Harry Anning of the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen. The memorial was erected by his friends and comrades with the help of a public subscription after he was killed in action at Koffiefontein, South Africa on 6 August 1901 at the age of eighteen. It was originally sited at the junction of Lytton and Hemmant Roads, but was re-sited in 1968 after it was hit by a car. The Anning memorial was constructed at an early phase of the history of war memorials in the state. After the First World War, the construction of war memorials was prolific. In 1903, when this memorial was unveiled, they were still quite rare. Australian war memorials are valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. Although there are now many different types of memorials throughout Queensland there are few Boer War Memorials. Amongst these, other Brisbane memorials include the Caskey Monument (1902) in Toowong Cemetery, the Berry and MacFarlane Monument (1902) at Sherwood and the South African War Memorial (1919) in Anzac Square, Brisbane.  Description  Detail, 2015 The Boer War Memorial is situated in a large park in Hemmant. It sits beside a grassed playing area in front of a group of children's swings. The sandstone memorial comprises a base and pedestal surmounted by an obelisk. It sits on a concrete pad and is surrounded by evenly spaced metal posts linked by a metal chain. The base is a smooth faced step with a chamfered top edge. Surmounting this is the pedestal plinth which is smooth faced and capped with large cyma recta mouldings. The front face displays a high relief carving of a trooper's hat and bandolier. Rising from the plinth is the pedestal dado. It is a square pillar with recessed panels on each side. The front face has a leaded marble plaque set into the recess bearing an inscription to Lance Corporal John Harry Anning. The dado is capped by a large cornice made up of a number of cyma recta and torus mouldings. Projecting from the pedestal is the obelisk. It sits on a plinth capped with cyma recta and torus mouldings and also has a leaded marble plaque on the front face. It bears another inscription to Lance Corporal Anning. The obelisk has a relief carved tasselled shroud draped over the top, symbolising death and mourning. Below the shroud are relief carved crossed rifles, bound with cord and resting on a banner. The banner hangs from a staff with a small crown at the top.  Heritage listing  left The Anning Monument was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. The memorial was constructed at an early phase of the history of war memorials in the state. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. It is an uncommon example of a memorial erected in memory of a single soldier. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Boer War Memorial is an important Queensland monument. It is one of the few memorials in Queensland to commemorate the involvement and death of Queensland soldiers in the Boer War of 1899-1902. After the First World War, memorials were erected in most Queensland towns, however in 1903, when this memorial was unveiled, they were still quite rare. It is an uncommon example of a memorial erected in memory of a single soldier. The memorial at Hemmant demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the appropriate use of various symbolic elements including a shroud, crossed rifles, and obelisk The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Boer War Memorial is of aesthetic significance for its high level of workmanship and design. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event and as the focal point for the remembrance of that event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

It is one of the best-selling chess books of all time, with over one million copies sold. Overview The book is intended for beginners and uses a programmed learning approach,Shelby Lyman on Chess: A World Class Teacher permitting readers to go back and retry each question if they give a wrong answer. Unusually for a modern chess book, it requires no knowledge of chess notation, using only diagrams with arrows and verbal descriptions of chess moves such as \\"rook-takes-pawn-check\\". The book begins with an explanation of the rules of chess. The puzzles focus exclusively on finding checkmate, beginning with mate in one move and moving on to mate in two, three and four. Combinations involving back rank mates are particularly emphasized. The cover of the book shows an image of Bobby Fischer using his Dubrovnik chess set, which he considered to be the best chess pieces to play chess.Bobby Fischer discussing his Dubrovnik chess set Publishing history The book was originally published in 1966 by Basic Systems Inc, a subsidiary of Xerox.Francis Mechner, Some Historic Roots of Education Reform (pdf) A paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in 1967 and sold 10,000 copies by early 1972. Due to the interest in the 1972 Fischer‚ÄìSpassky World Championship match, the book was reprinted eight times that year alone. In 1994, Interplay Entertainment released a computer chess program of the same name based on the book.Interplay Entertainment ‚Äì Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess (Online) The software received mixed reviews, PC Gamer noting the \\"ugly 2-D board\\" and Entertainment Weekly describing the lessons as \\"humorless... dogmatic, and fearsome\\".Moby Games,Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess Reviews, 1995 Authorship The extent of Fischer's involvement in the book has been questioned. Andrew Soltis writes that Fischer \\"contributed some ideas, but chiefly his name\\". Brady says that Fischer concentrated on working on it after the Capablanca Memorial chess tournament in 1965 and that Mosenfelder, Margulies and Leslie Ault, who were all strong players, as well as educational experts, \\"helped him in outlining and editing the work\\". According to Margulies, Fischer wanted a high quality work free of any errors, so Michael Valvo and Raymond Weinstein were brought in as proofreaders. Reception Chiefly due to its accessibility for beginners and Fischer's high public profile, the book sold an estimated one million copies. It is difficult to determine chess book sales with certainty, but this figure, based on the royalty payments made to co-author Stuart Margulies, makes it a candidate for best-selling chess book of all time. In October 1972, following Fischer's victory in the World Championship, the Bantam edition appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list at No. 2 on the general paperback list. It remained in this position for four weeks. Frank Brady, who was hired by Basic Systems as a promotional consultant, later said the book \\"lacked color or even a fleeting glimpse into the real way Bobby's mental processes work.\\" and that it \\"was not ... one of the great introductory chess treatises of modern times.\\" The Times Literary Supplement, reviewing a 1973 British edition, criticized Fischer's grammar as well as the lack of content, which they said could have been compressed to fifty pages.Times Literary Supplement, March 30, 1973, p 362 In popular culture The book remains in print and has achieved some degree of recognition in popular culture. *Grandmaster Maurice Ashley has said that this was his first chess book. *It is referenced in Janet Fitch's novel White Oleander.

The former railway station is also known as the Murwillumbah Railway Station and yard group. The station opened on 24 December 1894 and closed on 16 May 2004 when the line from Casino was closed. The station was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Beyond the station, the line continued for a few kilometres as a freight line to Condong. It served a sugar mill until 1972. Murwillumbah had a X200 shunter until the opening of a new motorail siding in August 1988 made it surplus. Despite no longer being served by trains, the station remains open as a NSW TrainLink booking office. The station forecourt is served by NSW TrainLink coach services to Casino, Tweed Heads and Robina, and Premier Motor Service services to Brisbane, Lismore and Sydney.Timetables Premier Motor Service It is also currently used as the town's tourist information centre.  Description  The complex comprises a type 12 station pre-cast concrete freight station, erected ; a goods shed being a side shed without awning with an end platform, erected in 1894. Other structures included a concrete/steel/brick platform face; a water tower with a round brick base with cast iron tank over, erected ; and a jib crane - T533, erected 1894. Murwillumbah had one platform, with a passing loop and motorail siding at the northern end of the station. It was served by trains from Sydney including the North Coast Mail until 1973, when replaced by the Gold Coast Motorail which in February 1990 was replaced by a XPT service.  Heritage listing  Murwillumbah is a good example of a station constructed in the 1920s from pre cast concrete, the predominant material of the period of which relatively little has survived. The building is a substantial structure which has maintained the form of the earlier building with the change of material. It forms part of a group that contains a very good goods shed example and a rare water tank on a round brick base, only three of these were built, all on the north coast line. The station building has had some recent additions of poor quality which detract from significance. The site is also significant because of its connection with the carrying of vehicles on the Motorail service (no longer operating) and the facilities connected with that activity. The Murwillumbah railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare.

It was built from 1865 to 1866. It is also known as Hemmant Methodist Church, Hemmant Uniting Church, and Tingalpa Wesleyan Methodist Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building was opened in November 1866 as the Tingalpa Wesleyan Methodist Church, within the East Brisbane Circuit ‚Äì later incorporated into the Wynnum Circuit as the Hemmant Methodist Church. The Tingalpa district, which included Hemmant, had been opened up to farming in 1859. Settlement expanded following the introduction of the 1864 Coffee and Sugar Regulations, when most of the land in the district along Doughboy Creek (Bulimba Creek) and the Brisbane River was taken up for sugar growing. The Reverend Beaizley called for tenders for the construction of a Wesleyan Church at Church Hill, Tingalpa in August‚ÄìSeptember 1865. The building was officially opened in November 1866. Local involvement included that of the Hon. Angus Gibson, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council, who served as a church trustee for 50 years. Together with the Hemmant State School, built in 1864, the church contributed to the nucleus of the village of Hemmant. The building was extended by at an unknown date, and in 1947 the windows and most of the interior fittings and furniture were replaced. Hemmant Methodist Church functioned as the Hemmant Uniting Church following the amalgamation of Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches as the Uniting Church in Australia in the mid-1970s. In 1988 it was closed due to a declining congregation. Saved from demolition by a local community group, the building was re-opened as the non-denominational Hemmant Christian Community Church.  Description  Bell turret, 2015 This weatherboard church is rectangular in shape with a small gabled front porch. A bellcote surmounts the front of the gable roof which is in corrugated iron. The front gable is decorated with scalloped timber barge boards. There are 6 gothic-style leadlight windows along each side of the building and two at the front. They are all memorials to the church's pioneer families. The interior walls and ceiling are lined with horizontal double-headed tongue and groove boards. A folding timber screen divides the building in two, separating the church from a meeting room.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Hemmant Christian Community Church, erected in 1865-66, is significant historically as one of the oldest churches in Brisbane, associated with the early establishment of Methodism in Queensland and with the development of Tingalpa/Hemmant as a farming district in the second half of the 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building illustrates the principal characteristics of a modest, 19th century timber gothic-style church in Queensland, and has functioned as a community focus and landmark for over 130 years.

He received a gallantry award for his work during Operation Gibraltar in 1965. Early life Munawar was born in Chakwal District, Punjab, British India. As a young boy, he was spotted winning an athletics race that he had entered on the spur of the moment and was nurtured by the British for a role in the army.  Career Awan was among those captured and made prisoner of war by Japanese forces while trying to defend Singapore in World War II. He learned the Japanese language while incarcerated and his fluency brought him to the attention of his captors. They moved him out of the prison camp and enlisted him in the Imperial Japanese Army, where he received special training. When the Indian National Army, led by Subhas Chandra Bose, was formed in 1942, Awan joined its fight for Indian independence from British rule. He was captured by the Allied forces and returned to India to stand trial for treason at the end of World War II. Awan was freed, along with other INA prisoners, when the Partition of India occurred. He moved to Pakistan and was invited to join the Pakistan Army by prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan. He then joined the Azad Kashmir Regular Forces (AKRF), which later became the Azad Kashmir Regiment. Operation Gibraltar was launched in July 1965 with the aim of Pakistani infiltration of Jammu & Kashmir. Awan, who now held the rank of major, was involved in this, leading troops in heavy fighting at a pass near to Rajouri. He controlled an area of around 500 square miles for a period of three months and, according to Lt General Mahmud Ahmed in his book War 1965, Munawar enjoyed full support from the local population of the valley. By the time the Second Kashmir War ended, Munawar was in effective control of Rajouri valley and welcomed UN military observers who landed in Rajouri valley to monitor the ceasefire. However after the Tashkent Agreement between India and Pakistan, he was ordered to withdraw his forces and return to Rawalpindi. Awan was awarded the Sitara-i-Jurat for his actions in the Rajouri valley, and was also referred to as the \\"King of Rajouri\\" by Field Marshal Ayub Khan. He died a few years later. Memorials Munawar Pass, a pass in Pir Panjal mountain range north of Pir ki Gali overlooking the town of Rajouri in Indian Kashmir was named after Major Munawar by the locals.

It was built during 1942. It is also known as the Hemmant Gun Emplacements and 6 (390) Australian Anti-Aircraft Battery and 390 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Gun Station Class A. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2000.  History  The Hemmant Gun Battery was constructed as part of the defence facilities of Brisbane. The Hemmant Gun Battery was part of a series of \\"A class\\" (four gun) defensive positions constructed in an effort to monitor aircraft entering Brisbane airspace during World War II. Others included Colmslie (385), Balmoral (387), Amberley (391) and Archerfield (392). They were built to provide protection to nearby Australian and US naval facilities located along the Brisbane River at Hamilton and Eagle Farm, as well as providing cover for nearby Brisbane airfield. The sighting of gun stations near the Brisbane River also had strategic importance as enemy aircraft would use the river as a navigational aid when conducting reconnaissance. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Australia's focus in the war turned to the Pacific Ocean. After the bombing of Darwin in February 1942, many felt that as Brisbane was the largest city in Queensland, it could possibly be the next to experience a large scale raid by the Japanese. Brisbane was already designated as a staging point, with a significant US buildup underway and the best port facilities in Queensland. Due to Brisbane's distance from the front line, it could not be raided by land-based bombers however, which had added to the devastation in Darwin. Thus any bombing attack would come from aircraft carriers or long range flying boats refuelled by submarines. Between March and July the Japanese conducted regular reconnaissance missions over Cairns and Townsville using long range twin-engined aircraft. Townsville was actually bombed three times in late July, and the town of Mossman once. During the Townsville raids, A Class stations of 16 HAA (X and Y Batteries) fired on raiding Kawanishi flying boats. While the Japanese were able to penetrate Australia's defences on these occasions, the May Battle of the Coral Sea prevented Japan from completing its objective of achieving large scale carrier based raids along the Queensland coast. Although Brisbane was never bombed, reconnaissance missions, such as those from submarine based floatplanes or long range flying boats are likely to have occurred. Similar missions were conducted and have been documented over east coast towns from Cairns to Hobart. Sightings and unit records of aircraft capable \\"I\\" class submarines in deep water passages near Bribie and Moreton Islands have been recorded, and it is highly likely that similar intelligence gathering missions occurred over Brisbane. The site was manned by both AWAS (Australian Women's Army Service) and VDC (Volunteer Defence Corps) personnel from mid 1943, and these arrangements remained in place until August 1945 when all of the HAA sites were disarmed. In 1942 the Commonwealth Government requisitioned an area of land in the quiet farming community of Hemmant. Known as a class A gun station, 6 (390) Australian HAA originally contained four autofrettaged type guns, manufactured in Australia. The anti-aircraft gun was developed shortly before World War Two and was the standard medium anti-aircraft gun for the British Army from 1938 to 1956. Effective range was around . The octagonally shaped emplacements with surrounding magazine/store rooms originally housed a sandbagged entry point with more bags placed on the magazine roof. Rooms contained rifle racks and anti gas equipment, 280 rounds of ammunition for the AA gun and canvas flap doors for the perimeter entrances. Hidden from aerial view, four separate underground magazines provided cool storage for high explosive rounds. The guns were controlled by a centrally located command post/plotting room. Sightings of suspicious aircraft were relayed to the post for action by Fighter Sector Headquarters which was in turn in communication with observer units. Within the command post were pits for a height finder and predictor. Each gun had to be in sight of the height predictor, which could be no more than above or below any gun. Further displacement caused errors, as the predictor could only solve deflection (angle). To find the height of an aircraft, a separate height finder had to be used. A kitchen, showers, latrines and three sleeping quarters were located to the northern extremity of the site next to Hemmant road. It is likely that these structures were prefabricated facilities. No evidence of these buildings remains. One of the four magazines constructed as part of the battery has also been demolished in the years since the end of the war.  Description  The former Hemmant Gun Battery is situated along Fleming Road on the peak of Hemmant hill. The Brisbane CBD is visible to the north-west of the site. The anti-aircraft battery consists of three separate underground ammunition magazines, four gun platforms and a semi-underground command post/plotting room, all constructed of reinforced concrete. The three separate magazines are of identical size, single-roomed, underground and show evidence of a ventilator. The noticeable drop in temperature on entering the structures illustrates the designers awareness of local conditions, and storage of highly explosive material in a sub tropical climate. All magazines and the command post/plotting room have had their steel doors removed. Three of the four gun emplacements are visible, the fourth partially buried and built upon. The structures are octagonally shaped and surrounded by magazine/store rooms. The most visible example has been converted into a chicken pen. Two drains are located in the floor of the structure with holdfast points for the guns remaining. The second remains intact but has a private dwelling placed on top, and is used as a garage and storage area. The third emplacement has been filled with water and converted to a pool. All three (and presumably the fourth) have the encircling magazine/storage rooms intact. The command post/plotting room is structurally intact and has recently been converted into a gazebo and fernery. The former Hemmant Gun Battery is the best preserved example of a Class A Gun Station in south east Queensland. It is also the last in the five station group that served Brisbane.  Heritage listing  6 (390) Australian Anti-Aircraft Battery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. 6 (390) Aust HAA Hemmant is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as an installation designed to protect Brisbane in the event of enemy air-raids during that conflict. It was one of several anti-aircraft batteries located strategically along the Brisbane River, built to protect Australian and United States naval facilities and Brisbane airfield, and to monitor enemy reconnaissance activity. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Hemmant Battery is the only visible and substantially intact anti-aircraft battery in Brisbane, and as such demonstrates a rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Battery, in its siting and planning, demonstrates the measures implemented for the strategic defence of Brisbane during World War II. It is a relatively intact example of the \\"Brisbane Line\\" fortifications and has the potential to yield further information about this aspect of Queensland's history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Hemmant Battery, with its extant command post, gun emplacements and magazines, and its location in a prominent position overlooking the Brisbane skyline, is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an Australian Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Hemmant Battery, set among grassed lawns and paddocks in the sparsely populated suburb of Hemmant, is important because of its aesthetic significance.

It was built from 1865 to . It is also known as Edwin Marsden Tooth Memorial Home. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The earliest section of Lota House, a substantial two-storeyed rendered brick residence, was constructed in 1865-66 for Irish born Queensland early settler, William Duckett White and his wife, Jane. Jane was the owner of Lota House until her death in 1887 when she bequeathed it to her son Albert and to William as his home for his lifetime. William Duckett White died at Lota House in 1893. Lota was erected on approximately of land. It was described by the White's son-in-law, Graham Douglas Mylne, as a grand, comfortable house with large rooms, fresh breezes, and views over Moreton Bay. The entrance to Lota House faced south, but the principal rooms overlooked the bay to the east. A dairy was located on the southwest corner of the house, truncating the surrounding ground floor verandahs. The ground floor comprised a large entrance hall with drawing and dining rooms to the right, an office and staircase leading to the upper level on the right, a small sitting room at the end of the hall, next to which was a bootroom, and a pantry beneath the staircase, from which access to a cellar was gained. Upstairs comprised bedrooms and a dressing room. Servants' quarters and kitchen were located in a detached wing. A pair of large white gates flanked by Moreton Bay figs (located on what is now White's Road with a gatekeeper's lodge nearby) gave access to a curved drive leading through open grass paddocks to the house, which was surrounded by extensive gardens designed by Jane White. At the rear of the house a grassed courtyard separated it from stables, coachhouses, and haylofts opposite, and a detached kitchen wing and servants' quarters at right angles to the main building was connected to the house by a covered walkway. In the courtyard were two deep underground tanks, each covered with a large, circular cut stone, and from these rain water was pumped to the house, kitchen, stables and garden. Further to the west, on the slope behind the stables, were yards, cow bales, fowl houses and pig styes, as well as a hut accommodating South Sea Islanders working on the property. Cows and horses grazed in the paddocks surrounding the house, and maize, sorghum and hay were grown on the flats of Lota Creek as supplementary fodder. Like most of the farmers in the district, White probably grew sugar cane on the property. The estate ran down to the bay, where by the 1910s there was a boat-shed and jetty. In 1908, William and Jane's grandson, William Duckett White (Duckett), acquired the property which he renovated and extended. The extensions were of timber and comprised a substantial two- storied wing at the rear incorporating kitchen and laundry on the ground floor and service stairs leading to a school room, spare bedroom, two bathrooms and servants' quarters on the upper floor; a single-storied day nursery on the west corner of the downstairs verandah; a separate billiard room to the northwest of the house; and a covered way and bush house roofed with wooden slats between the billiard room and the main house. Brisbane architect Claude William Chambers called tenders for the work in September 1908. At this time, the 1865-66 dining and drawing rooms were redecorated by the Sydney firm Beard Watsons with ornate timber mantelpieces (replacing earlier white marble) and new wallpapers and carpets. Duckett White also subdivided the estate, with land sales starting from 1911, and the grounds surrounding Lota House were reduced to just under . The pine trees lining the driveway from Oceana Terrace to the front of the house were most likely planted at this time. Graham Ernest Mylne, son of Captain Graham Douglas Mylne and Helena White, purchased Lota House from his cousin Duckett White in 1913. Graham was general manager of White Collins & Co. from 1913 to 1942, and his wife Kathleen was prominently involved with the Queensland Country Women's Association. Graham Mylne died in 1958. In 1957, businessman and philanthropist Edwin Marsden Tooth died, bequeathing to the Anglican Church to support their schools and other charitable work with a specific request that the church establish an aged care home. The church purchased Lota House from Kathleen, widow of Graham Mylne, to establish the Edwin Marsden Tooth Memorial Home for aged care. The remnant eucalypt woodland on the southeast and southwest perimeters of the property has been associated with Lota House from the earliest establishment of the estate. The woodland, which extends over the cliff along The Esplanade, forms a landmark in the Lota area and has been entered in the Brisbane City Council's Brisbane Conservation Atlas (prepared in the 1980s and 1990s) for its high biological and scenic values. In 1992 this woodland was subject to a BCC Vegetation Protection Order for its high scenic and landscape value.  Heritage listing  Lota House (now Edwin Marsden Tooth Memorial Home) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Lota House illustrates part of the pattern of Queensland history: the 1860s establishment of gentry estates in Brisbane's eastern bayside suburbs. In particular, the formation and later subdivision of the Lota Estate determined the manner in which the Lota area developed from the 1860s to the early years of the 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The house is rare as the oldest surviving residence in the Manly-Lota area, remains one of few 1860s residences of its type to survive in Queensland, and offers an illustration of a past way of life which is no longer common. It is also a rare example of 1860s Georgian-influenced domestic architecture surviving in Queensland. The surviving eucalypt woodland, the Bunya pine and other early trees provide rare evidence of the nature of the early Lota estate garden and grounds. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The earliest section of Lota House illustrates the principal characteristics of a substantial, two-storeyed, Georgian-influenced 1860s brick residence, in particular the external and internal symmetry and proportions, delicate detailing, and choice of materials: brick, render, slate and cedar. Its siting on a prominent location with panoramic views and extensive grounds exemplifies its class and era. The 1908 extensions and renovations illustrate the evolving nature of a large, bayside family home. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The earliest section of Lota House is important in exhibiting a number of aesthetic features: the simple rectilinear form punctuated by the colonnaded verandah retains the elegant symmetry and proportion of the Georgian influence; the retention of the internal proportions and planning; the substantial amount of original fabric remaining intact, particularly the cedar joinery which includes doors, skirtings, architraves and staircases; and the sliding louvred shutters to the upper windows and French doors which are also rare and innovative. The woodland is a landmark in the Lota area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Lota House has an important association for the local community with the establishment and development of European settlement in the Manly-Lota district: the name of the suburb is derived from Lota House, a number of the nearby streets have been named after Lota House occupants, and the place features prominently in the published history of the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Lota House is significant also for its association from 1860 until 1960 with prominent Queensland pastoralist families, the William Duckett White family and the Graham Douglas Mylne family. Since 1960 it has had a strong association with the work of the Anglican Church in aged-care.

He immigrated to Germany in 1993 and settled in D√ºsseldorf, where he started an import-export business. In 1997, he returned to Kosovo and later joined the KLA with the intention of helping separate the region from Yugoslavia. During his time as a guerrilla, he came to be known by the nickname \\"Hitler\\" because of his likeness to the Nazi leader. Following the Kosovo War, he settled in Mitrovica and opened a string of Nazi-themed restaurants that angered some NATO peacekeepers and were quickly closed. Xhinovci firmly believes that he is Hitler reincarnated and resorted to portraying the Nazi leader full-time in his public life, posing for pictures with locals, peacekeepers and tourists and charging between 20 and 80 euros per photograph. He is well known throughout Mitrovica, and his five daughters are referred to by locals as \\"Hitler's children\\". Xhinovci always carries a copy of Hitler's autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf with him and is frequently paid to attend events such as weddings and funerals. He is the subject of a short documentary film directed by independent filmmaker Alban Muja, titled Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me. Early life, emigration and guerrilla activity \\"People have called me Hitler since my army days. They say I look a lot like him‚Äîunlike the English guy who plays him in that movie.\\" A Kosovo Albanian, Emin Xhinovci was born in Kosovska Mitrovica in 1959, in what was then Yugoslavia. In 1993, he moved to the German city of D√ºsseldorf, where he started an import-export business. He left Germany in 1997 and returned to Kosovo to \\"fight for the motherland\\" as tensions between Albanians and Serbs increased. Xhinovci joined the Kosovo Liberation Army (; or KLA) in 1998, and fought against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army () with the goal of separating Kosovo from Yugoslavia. Xhinovci earned the reputation of a \\"fierce fighter\\" and commanded the respect of local Albanians. His comrades gave him the nickname \\"Hitler\\" due to his uncanny resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Xhinovci told journalist Una Hajdari: \\"People have called me Hitler since my army days. They say I look a lot like him‚Äîunlike the English guy who plays him in that movie,\\" apparently a reference to Charlie Chaplin's role in The Great Dictator. Serbian police documents from 1998 indicate that he was suspected of participating in the kidnapping and execution of nine Serb mineworkers at the Belaƒáevac coal mine, near Obiliƒá. In 1999, Xhinovci was wounded in battle and airlifted to Germany for treatment. While in hospital, he grew a toothbrush moustache which attracted the attention of hospital staff. Controversy Nazi-themed restaurants and bars Following his experience with the German hospital staff, Xhinovci realized that he could capitalize on his resemblance to Hitler. He went to great lengths to enhance his physical likeness to the Nazi leader‚Äîregularly clipping his moustache, dying his hair jet black and imitating Hitler's signature hairstyle. When the war in Kosovo ended, Xhinovci returned to Mitrovica and opened a bar called Bar Hit and Jet, known affectionately among Kosovo Albanians as Pizzeria Hitleri (\\"Hitler's Pizzeria\\"). The establishment proved controversial among western peacekeepers who had occupied Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces in June 1999. In one instance, French NATO troops took down a sign carrying a swastika from the entrance to Xhinovci's bar, much to his displeasure. One French commander told reporters that he was disgusted with Xhinovci's actions and said that his troops were forbidden from entering the bar, which juxtaposed Nazi imagery with portraits of Xhinovci in KLA uniform. Asked why he enjoyed dressing up as Hitler, Xhinovci responded: \\"Everyone who is against the people who carried out bloodshed against [Albanians] is a friend of mine\\", apparently referring to the German-led Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, when German forces turned a blind eye to Albanian raids on Serb-populated areas of Kosovo. He conceded that Hitler had gone \\"too far\\" by killing women and children, but said that it would be \\"a good idea to eliminate all those who thirst for our blood\\". Within several years, Xhinovci was forced to close Pizzeria Hitleri because local KLA commanders felt that it would tarnish the organization's image. Like many in post-war Kosovo, he encountered great financial difficulties and relied on his KLA service pension and financial assistance from relatives in Western Europe. Once his financial situation stabilized, Xhinovci opened a restaurant and named it Jehona after his oldest daughter. All of the restaurant's receipts were stamped with a black swastika in the upper left corner. The restaurant closed a few years after its opening for reasons unknown. Hitler impersonator Following the closure of Pizzeria Hitleri and Jehona, Xhinovci has resorted to walking around Mitrovica dressed as Hitler and posing for pictures with locals, tourists and NATO peacekeepers, charging between 20 and 80 euros per photograph. Some days, he earns as many as 200 euros posing as Hitler. Besides posing for photographs, Xhinovci attends various events, including weddings and funerals, and greets attendees with a Nazi salute. \\"[This] sometimes has an undesirable effect because people who've come to pay their respects to the deceased often wish to speak with me and take pictures,\\" Xhinovci explains. Xhinovci has come to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began dressing as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word \\"Hitler\\" printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby‚Äîincluding some NATO peacekeepers‚Äîstop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: \\"I have a lot of other things to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it.\\" Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living \\"shows great enterprise\\". \\"People respect me,\\" Xhinovci explains. \\"The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with \\"Heil Hitler\\". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as \\"Hitler's children\\", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. \\"Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person‚Äîshe doesn't mind.\\" Xhinovci is unable to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of laws which prohibit Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says that he would have to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb-held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post-war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: \\"It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies.\\" About his physical similarity to Hitler, he says: \\"I am not a dictator like him, but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him.\\" Xhinovci is a controversial figure in some Kosovar circles. Kosova Aktuell, a Pristina-based German-language newspaper, called his actions \\"scandalous and unacceptable\\". In popular culture In 2013, Kosovar filmmaker Alban Muja created a short documentary film about Xhinovci titled Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me, which chronicles Xhinovci's everyday activities and follows him around Mitrovica as he interacts with locals.

In Italy, they were called \\"Moto Carri\\". The Moto Guzzi had the advantage that their cargo sat behind the driver. This allowed the cargo to be stacked high without obstructing the view. In addition, the steering was slightly heavier when the machine was loaded. During and after the Second World War, Moto Carris were designed with specific military tasks in mind. Models Motocarro Typo 107 In 1928 the first model appeared: the Typo 107. The entire front was a Moto Guzzi Sport, where a frame was screwed. The machine could be quickly converted to a regular motorcycle. The Style 107 with no trailer cost 8,150 lira, those with a trailer cost 8,600 lira. Engine Like the Sport, the Style 107 had an engine block, with an engine and gearbox, a common sump and lubrication system. It was a head / side valve engine. Normally, such an engine was used in the overhead valve as inlet valve, and the side door as an outlet. But the outlet had the greatest need for cooling wind, so he fitted his lying to OHV engine this cover. It was operated by a push rod and a rocker arm. The inlet valve was driven by a simple tappet. The cast iron cylinder had lengthwise cooling ribs. The piston had four rings, plus another two oil rings. Therefore, the oil could remain within bounds. Because of the direction of rotation of the motor (backwards) the crankshaft pitched the oil splash lubrication up against the top of the cylinder rather than directly back into the oil pan. Gravity took care of the lubrication of the rest of the cylinder wall. The machine had an oil return pump that sat on the crankcase and the oil from the crankcase carried back to the tank, which was just below the fuel tank in the wind. Therefore, an automatic dry-sump system formed. The fuel supply was by Amac. It used a semi-automatic slide carburetor and on the steering wheel sat manettes for the gas and the choke. Powertrain The drivetrain matched those of the Sport, using a primary drive with gears, a wet multi-plate clutch, a three-speed gearbox and a chain to the rear wheel. That chain was long, and used a support gear with a tensioning device. The rear brake was a pedal-operated brake band. Chassis The engine frame was welded in one piece. Sport had no front brake, but the motocarro had a drum brake on the front wheel. The front suspension consisted of a Girdervork with a central helical spring without damping. The \\"frame\\" was a simple structure consisting of two box girders that ran from the engine to the rear axle and frame were supported by two tubes from the seatpost. Above the rear axle, two leaf spring assemblies mounted, which does not afveerden the engine, but the container does. Motocarro Sport 14 When the Moto Guzzi Sport 14 came on the market in 1929, the transport tricycle was fitted with its parts. The introduction of the Sport 14 happened by a gradual evolution of the \\"Sport\\". Mototriciclo 32 and Motocarro 109-32 The Mototriciclo 32 came from a military command triporteurs delivered to the Italian army. In order to increase maneuverability, the wheelbase was slightly smaller, as was the track width. The technique came from the Sport 15, which in 1931 had been launched, with the exception of the magneto (Marelli instead of Bosch), probably because the army did not want to be dependent on foreign suppliers, and greater fuel capacity. 935 copies were delivered to the army, but 143 units were sold to citizens under the type name motocarro 109-32. P 250 Prototype When the P 250 came on the market in 1934, Moto Guzzi also built a Triporteur based on this model, which had the 232 cc engine. Technically, there was no difference with the other models. The front was P 250, the back had a trailer with leaf springs. The prototype P 250 could be provided with a closed container to which a canvas roof for the driver was confirmed. In addition, that could be protected by a touring windscreen, a canvas cover and leg shields. It never reached production. Motocarro S In 1934 the Moto Guzzi S series launched with the head / side valve engine of the Sport 15 and the four- speed gearbox from the Moto Guzzi V-Series. Since the drive now appeared to be that of the S-series. the vehicle was named \\"Motocarro S\\". However, the machine was modernized, with a rear differential, the gearbox had to choose three or four gears with one reverse. The payload increased to 800 kg. The rear axle was disc wheels. ER In 1938, the motocarro was provided with the overhead valve of the Moto Guzzi V-Series. It had three forward gears and one reverse, and three drum brakes. The payload increased to 1,000 kg. The loose chassis cost 9,800 lire, the complete Triporteur with building cost 10,400 lire. Tipo U The Tipo U 1942 was an improved version of the ER, built to government requirements. It received forced air cooling with a fan, but without the usual wind tunnel around the cylinder. In addition, a reduction stage was in the final drive, allowing a high and low gearing. In combination with the three-speed gearbox were two shipments in the final reduction 3 x 2 = 6 forward gears and 1 x 2 = 2 reverse gears on. The fork and chassis was reinforced. The payload increased to more than 1,000 kg. Ercole Ercole appeared in 1946 and remained in production until 1980. This model was more heavily built than its predecessors, and because of its increasing load capacity, it was fitted with additional transmission bevel gears behind the gearbox. Its V-Series engine had five forward gears and one reverse. The engine had forced air cooling. Payload reached 1,500 kg. Later versions had the engine of Moto Guzzi Falcone and an electric starter . As of 1960, one a cab mount was available, but unlike the \\"Edile\\", no chair. The cabin was just placed on the motorcycle. This should have been a cabin, because the engine noise was now reinforced by the cabin. Although broad shields were mounted next to the engine (up to the doors), water and mud could just penetrate. The brake system was hydraulic as was a kipinstallatie that by hand or - at extra cost - could be operated hydraulically. Edile Although Edile, which came on the market with Ercole in 1946, resembled a normal motocarro with a built cabin, the structure was completely different. The chassis consisted of a large central box beam that conveyed the steering head to the rear. The driver sat on the right side of the cabin, the engine (the usual 500 cc single cylinder) was in the center, combined with Ercole's five-speed gearbox with reverse gear. Control was carried out by a steering wheel via a strong and simple fork clerk. Also, the front wheel was a car wheel. The cabin held a spare tire. The Edile had no front or rear suspension. The cabin had no doors. The gear ratios were very close together because the speed was about 25 km / h. The Edile was meant to be more like a car. The payload was 3600 kg. The Edile was not a success and production was discontinued in 1947. Motocarro Ercolino In 1956 the small motocarro Ercolino came with a 192 cc two-stroke engine of Moto Guzzi Galletto scooter. The engine was well adapted. Moreover, it had forced air cooling. The first model had 15-inch drive wheels behind and a 14\\" front wheel drive. In 1959, smaller 10\\" wheels were fitted. The Ercolino had a kickstarter, with an optional electric starter. Load capacity was 350 kg, but could be increased to 590 kg. The base price was 389,000 lire, but variants with a cabin could increase the price up to 489,000 lire.  Autoveicolo da Montagna 3 X 3  At the end of the fifties Italian Ministry of Defence requested a vehicle for \\"Alpini\\" (mountain troops) who at that time used donkeys. It was suggested by General Garbari as project officer and included requirements such as: load capacity of 500 kg across all kinds of terrain, especially in mountainous areas and on narrow paths. The development was first placed in the hands of Antonio Micucci and later worked on by Soldavini and Giulio Cesare Carcano. Carcano had just introduced a new long mounted V-twin engine with forced air cooling. A 500 and a 650 cc version was intended for the Fiat 500, but Fiat withdrew from the project. Carcano saw his chance to find a use for his new engine. The \\"Mulo Meccanico\\" (Mechanical Donkey) offered wheel drive and variable wheelbase and track width. The 754 cc engine produced just 20 hp, due to a low compression ratio that, reflected low quality fuel. However 47 Nm was achieved at 2,400 rpm. Only one 26mm Weber carburetor used and a waterproof coil - ignition were used. The chassis system consisted of tubes and pressed steel box sections. The rear suspension consisted of two box girder arms that were cushioned by rubber suspension. At the front was a one-sided telescopic fork with coil springs. Control was done with a steering wheel through bevel gears. The driver sat on a motorcycle seat, but operation was through levers and pedals as in a car. The engine sat behind the driver. Behind it was a manual gearbox with six forward gears and one reverse. A central differential with a teruglooppal prevented roll back. 20% of the drive went to the front wheel, 80% to the rear wheels. Rear-wheel drive was done with two drive shafts that went diagonally from the differential to the two wheels, the front-wheel drive went through a propeller shaft leading from the differential between the cylinders through to the steering head. Using three bevel gears, the drive at the steering led to another drive shaft, which powered the front wheel. In one aluminum cabinet were the gearbox, the differential and the device to adjust the track width. The rear drum brakes were hydraulic operated, while the drum brake at the front used a Bowden cable. Behind the rear wheels were tensioning rollers, where a short caterpillar could be mounted. The front fender left enough space for a snow chain. However the machine did not meet expectations. Traveling straight the machine could mount steep slopes, but sideways risked falling over, because of the three wheels. Mountain trails had very short turns or rocks enough to stop the mechanical donkey while a real donkey could proceed. Therefore, the Autoveicolo da Montagna was taken out of production in 1963. AIACE In 1962 the motocarro AIACE appeared as a cheap means of urban transport. It was equipped with the engine of Moto Guzzi Zigolo 110, a small tweetaktje. It had a cabin with no doors in front of the engine. Therefore, the drive could be made directly from the three-speed gearbox with integrated differential. A reverse gear was included. Motorcycle handlebars and a swing fork were used. The rear shock absorbers were hydraulic. Without cab and superstructure AIACE cost 164,000 lire, increasing to 243,000. It was not a success: in 1963, production was stopped. Dingotre The Dingotre appeared in 1965 and intended for light transport. However, it had a big advantage: its 50 cc engine required no driver license. The engine was under the driver's seat and was equipped with forced air cooling. The Dingotre had no cabin, but a few large leg shields so that it looked like the front edge of a scooter. A thick tube and chassis were used. It offered a large foot pedal, with three gears. At the front was a telescopic fork. The rear wheels were small leaf spring suspension. A chain delivered power to the rear wheels. No reverse gear was included. The Dingotre remained in production until 1968 and was succeeded by the Furghino. The Dingotre cost 151,000 lire as a kit and 210 500 complete. Ciclocarro Furghino The Furghino was produced from 1968 to 1971. It used the engine of the Dingotre, with forced air cooling, but it was now mounted further back and longitudinally. This allowed a shaft drive to be used and the block was outside the cab. As with the AIACE, which had no cab doors, it was less luxurious than, for example, a Piaggio Ape. The Furghino kit cost 293,000 lira and complete 339,000 lira.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Early life William White was born into a large Quaker family on 5 October 1807 in Moate, County Westmeath, Ireland and was educated at the Quaker school in Mountmellick in County Laois. In 1835 William married Jane Simpson from Cork. Pastoral career William and Jane White and their two children emigrated from Ireland to Sydney as assisted immigrants in 1840. When he arrived in Australia, William assumed his grandmother's maiden name as a second Christian name, and became known thereafter as William Duckett White. From 1842-44 White taught school in the Mangrove area north of Sydney until accepting an offer in 1845 to manage the Beau Desert pastoral run in the Moreton Bay District for his cousin Joseph Phelps Robinson. When Robinson died in 1848, his brother George Robinson and W.D. White took over the lease of Beau Desert, one of the largest runs on the Logan River. In 1857, White left Beau Desert under the management of his son Ernest White and William, and with his wife Jane and their daughter Helena moved to Eagle Farm near Brisbane. Homestead on Beaudesert Station, circa 1871 The Robinson-White partnership acquired the leases of many cattle runs in Queensland. In addition to the Beau Desert lease they took up three runs in the Gold Coast hinterland in the early 1850s: Tubber in 1852 and Murry Jerry and Dungogie runs in 1853. In 1867 they took up the lease of Pimpama and Cumboomba (or Coombabah) runs in the Beenleigh area but these were thrown open for selection in 1869, and the lease forfeited. In 1871 White and partner William Barker leased the runs of Kerry, Sarabah, and Nindooinbah adjacent to Beau Desert. Much of Beau Desert was cut up for closer settlement in the 1860s and early 1870s following which WD White and his sons acquired the Bluff Downs leases in the Kennedy District. From 1882 the W.D. Whites & Sons formed a partnership with William Collins, Sir Malcolm McEachern, and Sir Simon Fraser. This partnership, called White Collins & Co., leased Beaudesert North, Eulolo, and Glen Ormiston and survived for about a century. The White partnership also owned land in Tingalpa (Lota) and town properties in Beenleigh and Southport. Lota House Lota House was erected on the Tingalpa land in 1865-66 and on completion it was transferred to W.D.White's wife Jane. Jane owned Lota House until her death in 1887 and bequeathed it to their son Albert with a proviso that it remain William's home for his lifetime. William died at Lota House in 1893 and is buried alongside Jane in the Tingalpa churchyard. Gravestone for William Duckett White, Tingalpa cemetery, 2005 Politics White was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on 26 April 1861. Although a lifetime appointment, he resigned from the Council on 5 August 1880. Later life WD White was active in the local community, being one of the first members of the Bulimba Divisional Board established in 1879‚Äì80, a warden of the Tingalpa Anglican Church (now Christ Church, Tingalpa). White died 11 August 1893 at Lota House. He was buried in Tingalpa Cemetery (Christ Church, Tingalpa) on Saturday 12 August 1893.

Designed in the brutalist style and constructed in 1964, its three-story perimeter grows to five and seven stories within, with three interior 22-story towers. It has been described as \\"beloved by architects and disliked by almost everyone else.\\" Description Peabody Terrace was completed in 1965 at a cost of $8.5million. On 5.9 acres (2.4ha), the 650,000-square foot (60,000m) complex consists of some 500 apartments (a mixture of \\"efficiencies\\" and one-, two-, and three-bedroom unitsall with 7-foot 6-inch, or 2.3m, ceilings) plus playgrounds, nurseries, roof terraces, laundromats/laundry rooms, meetings/seminar rooms, study rooms, and a parking garage. In order to maximize usable floor space and speed vertical transportation, the towers' elevators stop on every third floor only. The Harvard-affiliated Peabody Terrace Children's Center is housed on the complex grounds. Reception In the words of architecture critic Robert Campbell, the exterior reflects the desire of its designer, Harvard Graduate School of Design Dean Josep Llu√≠s Sert, to \\"bring the color and life of the Mediterranean to the white cubist architecture of northern Europe\\". It has also been called \\"an extension of Le Corbusier's communal prototype, the Unit√© d'Habitation\\". Originally designated as housing for married students, the partially completed project appeared in a Harvard Crimson photo over the caption, \\"University Moves to Thwart Early Marriages\\", and the Crimson later called it \\"well on the way to being just as hideous\\" as another Sert-designed building, Harvard's new administrative high-rise Holyoke Center. Nonetheless it received the Boston Society of Architects' Harleston Parker Medal and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. In 1965 Progressive Architecture said Sert had achieved \\"an efficiently workable interior arrangement, a lively sequence of exterior spaces, and a fluent continuity from low to high, and from old to new structures.\\" But by 1994 the same publication saw Peabody Terrace as \\"an embarrassment to Harvard, and the last resort of graduate students who couldn‚Äôt find a better place to live.\\" (The living units were renovated 19931995 and the common areas overhauled in 2013.)

It is approximately long and flows through Davidson Township in Sullivan County and Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County. The watershed of the stream has an area of . Glacial till and bedrock consisting of shale and sandstone can be found along the stream. It is named for the speed of its waters and the foliage along the sides of the stream. Course Rough Run begins on a plateau in Davidson Township, Sullivan County, not far from the edge of the West Branch Fishing Creek watershed. The stream flows south-southwest for a short distance before turning south-southeast and dropping off the plateau. It begins to descend steeply in a valley. After a few tenths of a mile, the stream turns south- southwest again and exits Sullivan County after several tenths of a mile. Upon exiting Sullivan County, Rough Run enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. It continues flowing south-southwest and steeply descending. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns southwest for several hundred feet. It then turns south-southeast for several hundred feet and reaches the slope. The stream reaches its confluence with West Branch Fishing Creek immediately afterwards. Rough Run joins West Branch Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth, only downstream of the mouth of Peterman Run. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Rough Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between .

She is one of the most highly cited scientists in the field of the epidemiology of obesity according to Thomson Reuters.Katherine Flegal Interview Education and career Flegal holds a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, a PhD from Cornell University, and an MPH from the University of Pittsburgh. In 1987, after working at the University of Michigan's biostatistics department, Flegal began working at the CDC. Research Flegal is well known for a series of influential and highly cited articles on the prevalence of obesity in US children and adults. In addition, she was a major contributor to the development of the 2000 CDC growth charts, used in the US to assess the growth patterns of infants and children. In 2005 Flegal and co-authors from CDC and NIH published a study in JAMA which found that being overweight was associated with lower mortality than normal weight and that obesity was associated with slightly higher mortality. After considerable discussion,Kolata, Gina. Rethinking Thin, The New Science of Weight Loss ‚Äì and the Myths and Realities of Dieting (2007), 201-208Lassek, William D. and Steven J.C. Gaulin. Why Women Need Fat (2012), 96-101 the CDC accepted Flegal's figures as correct. Flegal's article received CDC's highest science award, the Charles C. Shepard award, in 2006.List of Shepard award winners In 2013, Flegal was the lead author of a systematic review and meta- analysis published in JAMA regarding the association of overweight and obesity with mortality. In a large sample, drawn from other countries as well as the US, overweight people had lower mortality relative to people of normal weight. Reaction Flegal's 2013 paper was criticized by Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health, who called it a \\"pile of rubbish ... No one should waste their time reading it.\\" Willett was subsequently admonished for his unseemly behavior towards Flegal in an editorial and feature article in Nature, one of the world's pre-eminent scientific journals. Soon after Flegal's paper was published, the dean of Harvard Medical School, Jeffrey Scott Flier, convened a panel of experts to discuss the paper at Harvard. The panel met on February 20, 2013, where its members stated that Flegal's paper contained several methodological errors. For example, panelist Frank Hu said that Flegal's selection criteria \\"ruled out high-quality studies of 6 million people,\\" and that these studies, combined with those Flegal included in her review, showed that the highest survival rates are in people of normal weight. However, many researchers accept the results of Flegal's 2005 and 2013 papers and see them as an illustration of what is known as the obesity paradox.

It was built from 1868 to 1993. It is now known as the Pioneer Wedding Chapel. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 February 1998.  History  The present Christ Church Tingalpa was erected in 1886 for the Anglican parish of Tingalpa, replacing an 1868 church designed by Brisbane architect Richard George Suter and demolished during the cyclone of 5 December 1885. It is understood that materials salvaged from the wreckage of the 1868 church were used to construct the second, smaller building. Built and consecrated in 1868, the original Christ Church at Tingalpa was the first Anglican Church established between Kangaroo Point and Moreton Bay, pre-dating St Paul's at Cleveland (1873‚Äì74), St John the Baptist's at Bulimba (1888) and St Peter's at Wynnum (1898). Initially part of St Mary's at Kangaroo Point parish, the parish of Tingalpa was established by 1886. The Tingalpa site, one acre of high ground fronting the road to Lytton (now Wynnum Road) about beyond Kangaroo Point, was transferred early in 1868 from Joseph Berry to the Church Trustees (Bishop Edward Wyndham Tufnell and Tingalpa farmers Charles Coxen, John Mackenzie Shaw, Richard Warren Weedon and William Roach Wood). Importantly, the site was central to the small but scattered farming community of the Bulimba-Tingalpa district (which in 1868 encompassed Wynnum, Manly and Lota as well). The ground was cleared by voluntary labour and funds were raised through local and British subscription. The church was free of debt almost immediately it was completed, and consequently was among the earliest Anglican churches in the Brisbane district to be consecrated, pre-dating All Saints on Wickham Terrace, St Mary's at Kangaroo Point, and possibly St Thomas' at South Brisbane (erected 1855), but post-dating the first St John's Church, consecrated in 1854. Guests at the Christ Church consecration ceremony of 27 October 1868, to which 400 persons were invited, included the newly appointed Governor of Queensland, Colonel Samuel Blackall; the President of the Legislative Council, Sir Maurice O'Connell; the Chief Justice of Queensland, James Cockle; and the Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman John Hardgrave. Gravestone for William Duckett White, Tingalpa cemetery, 2005 The first Christ Church Tingalpa was a picturesque building and a landmark on the road from Brisbane to the southern end of Moreton Bay. Substantial stables were constructed in the grounds, but no parsonage or church hall was erected. On the same allotment a small burial ground was established. The first recorded burial was that of Susannah Weedon of Cannon Hill, on 12 July 1868. This was prior to completion of the church, constructed April‚ÄìAugust 1868. Later burials included the Hon. William Duckett White, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council, of Lota House and his family; Richard Thomas Jefferies (founder of the Queensland Musical Union - now the Queensland State and Municipal Choir - and of Palings Music Stores); and members of many of the early farming families of the Tingalpa-Wynnum district, including the Coxen family. The most recent interment was in 1993. In 1873 the Church trustees acquired from Joseph Berry an additional one-acre block adjoining the eastern boundary of the original allotment. In late 1874 both parcels of land were transferred from the Church Trustees to the Corporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane. Through the 1870s and 1880s Christ Church Tingalpa continued to serve a small, scattered rural community of approximately 50 square miles on the southeastern outskirts of Brisbane. In the early 1870s the principal cash crop in the district was sugar, but by the 1880s, changes in technology and the expansion of the sugar industry north of Brisbane had forced Tingalpa farmers into mixed farming and dairying, with some grape and wine production. Following the cyclone of 5 December 1885 which destroyed the 1868 Tingalpa church the local Anglican community, not prosperous but determined to rebuild, reconstructed their church using timbers salvaged from the original building. The second and present Christ Church Tingalpa was re- consecrated on 25 July 1886, smaller and less decorative than the first building, but still of weatherboard construction with a shingled roof. A concrete floor was laid this time, to give the building additional stability in strong winds. An early, undated photograph shows a detached, timber-framed bell tower with double cross-bracing and a pyramid-shaped shingled roof, to the east of the chancel. By the late 1880s Bulimba had become more densely settled and Wynnum-Lota-Manly boomed following the opening of the Cleveland railway line (via Wynnum) in November 1889. By the mid-1890s the Anglican parish of Tingalpa, still approximately 50 square miles, had a population of well over 6,000. St Peter's Anglican Church was erected at Wynnum in 1898. By 1899 the Bulimba church held 260 seats; St Peter's held 120; and Christ Church, with its 50 seats, was clearly no longer the focus of Tingalpa parish. In 1900 St John the Baptist Church was removed from the Tingalpa parish, and the Tingalpa rector concentrated his efforts on the booming Wynnum-Manly district. In 1906 Rev. J. H. Whitehead was appointed rector of Tingalpa parish, and due to his enthusiastic parish work Christ Church was renovated in 1907 and acetylene gas lamps installed. However, Rev. Whitehead resigned in 1910 due to ill health, and during the 1910s Christ Church was neglected. In 1923 St Peter's at Wynnum became a parish in its own right and Christ Church Tingalpa was declared to be extra-parochial and placed under the control and care of the Order of Witness. Founded by Bishop George Halford, who had resigned as Bishop of Rockhampton in 1920 to establish this work, the Order of Witness was a radical experiment within the Anglican church extension movement of the interwar period. Seeking to reach the men in the railway construction camps and mining camps, and the struggling families in the new soldier and immigrant settlements, Bishop Halford established an order of priests who lived very simply and were prepared to be sent anywhere a parish priest could not normally minister, living in the mining and construction camps, and bearing personal witness to their faith. To support their work, the Order obtained in 1922‚Äì1923 a small farm adjoining Christ Church Tingalpa. The farmhouse became their Priory, and the historic Tingalpa Church became their chapel. The priory, grounds and chapel of the Order of Witness were blessed by the archbishop of the Brisbane Diocese on 22 February 1923. The Church Chronicle of 1 March 1923:53 reported: \\"The old Church has been restored and enriched by additional ornaments and furniture. A painted figure of out Lord on the Cross hangs from the roof and the Altar is backed by dorsals and flanked by riddels of blue material. The cross and candlesticks are of silver. The whole effect is beautiful and devotional, and shows how even a little plain wooden Church can be transformed into a thing of beauty and joy. Local parishioners were encouraged to attend the Chapel services, and a call was made for funds to restore the building and cemetery.\\" Early in 1927 Bishop Halford left the Diocese of Brisbane, where he had been working in the Eidsvold and Burnett River districts, to carry out similar missionary work in the Diocese of Rockhampton. It appears that the Tingalpa priory closed soon after and by September 1929 Christ Church Tingalpa, considered one of the historic churches of Queensland, was part of Morningside parish. Services in the Tingalpa church continued for some years, but the building once again fell into disrepair. By the mid-1930s the church was no longer attached to a parish, and demolition was proposed. Once again the Tingalpa church was saved by an enthusiastic local priest. Rev. EJV Cavey, appointed to the Manly parochial district in 1938, took charge of Christ Church and organised a loan to renovate the building. The shingled roof was replaced with corrugated iron, the deteriorating concrete floor was replaced with hardwood, and the free- standing belfry was removed and replaced with a single cross-braced timber structure with a 4-gabled roof of corrugated iron, erected and dedicated to the memory of Miss Court, daughter of the first rector. The church was re- dedicated on 30 April 1939, and by November 1940 the debt had been cleared. In the post-Second World War period much of the farming land in the Tingalpa district was subdivided for suburban and industrial purposes, and the population expanded rapidly through the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s Christ Church Tingalpa was painted and re-lined and in 1964 a church hall was erected on the land acquired in 1873. By 1968, the centenary of its establishment, the future for Christ Church looked promising. However, with the decline in social relevance of established religions in the last quarter of the 20th century, has come yet another decline in the fortunes of Christ Church Tingalpa. In the early 1990s, the Anglican authorities once again called for its demolition. The belfry was removed in 1996, and all internal fittings, including a plaque erected to honour parishioners Stan Porter and his son Keith, who died in a Tingalpa plane crash in 1954, were removed. The church hall and the block of land acquired in 1873 have been sold. It was subsequently saved and restored by The Friends of Tingalpa Cemetery Heritage Group Inc, and the building is now known as the \\"Pioneer Wedding Chapel\\".  Description  Christ Church Tingalpa is a small, single-storeyed timber structure set well back from busy Wynnum Road at Tingalpa, on one acre of rising ground just east of the bridge over Bulimba Creek. The site fronts a major arterial road to the north, with light industrial development to the west, south and east. The church is aligned roughly east‚Äìwest on the site, presenting a side wall to the street, but the entrance in the western facade is visible from the road on the approach from Brisbane city. The building has a high pitched gabled roof clad with corrugated iron. The external walls which are clad with weatherboard sheeting, sit on a concrete base. The church has a simple rectangular plan, with a chancel alcove at the eastern end. To the south of the chancel is a small vestry, accessed both from the nave and from an external door in the western wall of the vestry. The chancel has a separate gabled roof, much lower than that of the nave but of the same pitch. The vestry at the southeast corner of the building also has a separate roof, the gable running at right angles to that of the chancel. A small entrance portico is centrally located in the western facade of the building, and above this is a pointed arched vent with sloping timber louvres. There are large timber finials to the western end of the main gabled roof and to the gabled roof of the portico, and a timber cross at the eastern end of the main roof. The main entrance is a pointed arched double timber door which is flanked by three-paned patterned glass windows with timber trefoils. Three such windows are found on each of the two longer sides of the church, one in the eastern end of the chancel wall, and one in the southern wall of the vestry. Internally, most of the walls and the ceilings are lined with fibrous cement sheeting, braced with timber strips. The chancel walls are clad with vertically-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. A hardwood floor has been superimposed above the original concrete flooring. None of the church furniture, decorations and plaques remains. The site contains a burial ground, with graves mostly to the west and south of the church, although the Coxen family grave is located in the area between the church and the street frontage to the north. All the graves are aligned to the east or southeast. The earliest headstone dates to 1868, the most recent to 1993, with burials in every decade in between. Some of the earlier graves retain their elegant wrought iron surrounds, and there are a number of substantial monuments and headstones illustrative of a variety of periods and styles. Unevenness of the ground in some parts is a fair indication that the site contains a number of unmarked graves as well. The site is bordered by substantial trees, mostly Norfolk Island pines. At the front northeast corner of the allotment are two large fig trees which appear to flank the original entrance to the grounds.  Heritage listing  Christ Church Tingalpa and Burial Ground was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 February 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Christ Church Tingalpa and Burial Ground, established 1868 with the church re-constructed in 1886, is important in illustrating the pattern of development of Queensland history. In particular it illustrates the development of the Tingalpa-Wynnum district from the mid-19th century. The establishment of Christ Church Tingalpa is important in illustrating the determination of early immigrants to transplant to Queensland the culture and religion of their homeland. Historically, the place is significant as one of the earliest consecrated Anglican churches in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The burial ground is of particular importance. It is very early, pre-dating the establishment of general cemeteries such South Brisbane Cemetery at Dutton Park, Toowong Cemetery, Balmoral Cemetery, Hemmant Cemetery, Bald Hills Cemetery and Lutwyche Cemetery in the 1870s. It is rare as one of only a handful of Anglican church burial grounds surviving in Brisbane, with others located at Christ Church, Milton, St Matthews Anglican Cemetery, Sherwood and St Matthews Anglican Church, Grovely. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. It is important for its potential to reveal information about the pattern of early settlement of Tingalpa and adjoining suburbs and of early social and living conditions. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. With headstones dating from 1868 to 1993, the burial ground contains monuments and headstones illustrative of a variety of periods and styles. It survives in reasonable order, and is a good example of a small church burial ground established in what was initially a rural district. Despite some white ant damage, the church remains a good example of its type - the simple, rectangular, pragmatic, ubiquitous Queensland weatherboard church - but appears to have retained some of the decorative elements of the first architect-designed building, including the timber trefoils to the windows, a trefoil arch in the portico, and the substantial pointed arched timber entrance doors. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building retains a picturesque setting, with tall perimeter planting and some of the earlier graves retaining their elegant wrought iron surrounds, and the whole makes a substantial aesthetic contribution to the Tingalpa townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Both church and burial ground are of special significance to the local community, with several generations of Tingalpa and district families having worshipped and been buried there. It has been significant as a centre for Anglican worship, observance and education since 1868. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a particular association with the work of the early settler families of the district, including the Weedon, Coxen, Stanton and White families, and is significant also for its association in the 1920s with the work of the experimental Order of Witness in Queensland.

He is a speleologist who has led and participated in expeditions to many of the longest and deepest caves in the USA, Mexico, and China. He has explored more than 2,500 caves across North America and Asia and has written two books chronicling his expeditions: \\"Yochib: The River Cave\\", and \\"Huautla: Thirty Years in One of the World's Deepest Caves.‚Äù TV shows such as National Geographic Explorer, NOVA and How‚Äôd They Do That? have aired programs on his expeditions. Biography Steele was born in Dayton, Ohio. As a child he moved to Los Angeles and Atlanta before settling back in Dayton where he graduated from Centerville High School in 1966. According to Steele, while out on a Boy Scout adventure when he was 13 years old, he discovered a previously unexplored passage in a Kentucky cave. During the trip he got the taste of original exploration and from that moment he was \\"bitten by the bug.\\" The following year, he organized an explorer post that specialized in speleology, joined the National Speleological Society, and became an Eagle Scout. In the late 1960s, Steele was involved in the exploration and mapping of Ellison‚Äôs Cave, Georgia. He began organizing caving expeditions to Mexico. In 1971, he explored and mapped the longest cave in Mexico at the time, Grutas de Juxtlahuaca, which contains the oldest known cave paintings in the Western Hemisphere. Based up on this exploratory work, Juxtlahuaca subsequently became a national park. He graduated from Indiana University in 1973, and became a full-time explorer for the remainder of the decade. He participated in numerous expeditions to the Silvertip Cave System in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area of Montana. Through the 1970s, along with others from an Austin, Texas-based group known as the Association for Mexican Cave Studies, he explored southern Mexico to look for deep caves. In 1976 and 1977, he led expeditions to explore a cave said to be the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most dangerous and difficult cave,‚Äù Sumidero Yochib, in Chiapas, Mexico. In 1977, he also co-led three expeditions to Oaxaca, Mexico, to explore Sistema Huautla, a cave system first discovered in 1965, and considered the deepest in the Western Hemisphere. Continuing to explore caves throughout the United States, Steele led and participated in expeditions to Sistema Huautla in Mexico almost every year through the 1980s. In 1987, the Huautla expedition connected the deep cave Nita Nanta to Sistema Huautla; which established it as the second deepest cave in the world. Steele went to Kijahe Xontjoa on the plateau to the east of Huautla with an expedition of Swiss explorers in 1993, and explored depths over 1,000 meters. Steele joined the Hong Meigui Cave Exploration Society Study Area in 2011 and 2012. The expedition explored two of China‚Äôs longest caves in the Wulong Province: San Wang Dong and Er Wang Dong, cave systems which Steele describes as the ‚ÄúCarlsbad Caverns of China‚Äù. In 2014, Steele helped to form the Proyecto Espeleologico Sistema Huautla (PESH), an official project of the National Speleological Society and the United States Deep Caving Team. The mission of PESH is to explore, survey and conduct a comprehensive speleological study of the Sistema Huautla area caves. Along with fellow cave explorer, Tommy Shifflett, Steele will lead annual expeditions from 2014-2023 to seek the deep. They have a goal of reaching 100 km in length and 1,610m in depth, a vertical mile. The expedition will also support the underground research of Mexican scientists. In addition to his expeditions, Steele had a 34-year career with the Boy Scouts of America, retiring in 2014 as National Director for Alumni Relations and the National Eagle Scout Association. He is the Chairman for the United States Deep Caving Team. He has written two books that chronicle his cave exploration in Mexico: ‚ÄúYochib:The River Cave‚Äù and ‚ÄúHuautla: Thirty Years in One of the World‚Äôs Deepest Caves‚Äù, both published by Cave Books. He is well-published in caving newsletters and journals. With James H. Smith he co-authored a chapter for ‚ÄúEncyclopedia of Caves.‚Äù He was profiled as one of 120 contemporary explorers in the 2009 book \\"Adventurous Dreams, Adventurous Lives\\".

Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 History After inquiring about the cost of chartering one of the Colorado River steamboats of George Alonzo Johnson and finding their rates too high, Lt. Ives ordered a steamboat built in 1857: :\\"In the latter part of June I ordered of Reaney, Neafie & Co., of Philadelphia, an iron steamer, fifty feet long, to be built in sections, and the parts to be so arranged that they could be transported by railroad, as the shortness of time required that it should be sent to California, via the Isthmus of Panama. About the middle of August the boat was finished, tried upon the Delaware, and found satisfactory, subject to a few alterations only. It was then taken apart, sent to New York, and shipped on board of the California steamer which sailed on the 20th of August for Aspinwall. Mr. A. J.

BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR, GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, WASHINGTON, 1861; PART I. GENERAL REPORT. After being transported by the Panama Railroad across the Isthmus to the Pacific Ocean, the Explorer was shipped again by steamship from Panama City up to San Francisco. From there expedition sailed with the parts of the steamboat on the deck of the schooner Monterey to the Colorado River Delta where it arrived November 30. There Ives oversaw its reassembly and launch on December 30, 1857 at Robinson's Landing, Baja California. David C. Robinson, owner of the landing and a pilot for George Alonzo Johnson, was made captain of the boat. After Ives used the Explorer to ascend the Colorado River, he sent it back to Fort Yuma with Richardson. There it was put up for auction and sold to George A. Johnson for $1000. He had its engine and paddle wheel removed and used it for a barge to carry firewood to steamboat landings. In 1864 it broke free from it moorings at Pilot Knob and was carried away 60 miles down river into the Delta where it sank in a slough, sometimes seen by passing steamers, until the river moved away from the location and it was hidden by the delta foliage and lost. Its wreck was found in 1929, by a survey party, in a dried up slough miles away from the new course of the river. A mere skeleton remained, its iron plates long ago removed to make comales for baking tortillas.

Suresvaracharya in his Taittirƒ´yavƒÅrttika (commentary on ≈öankƒÅra's work on the Taittirƒ´ya Upani≈üad) (II.297) has used the term kalpanƒÅ to mean ‚Äì 'inferior conception'. Vishnu Purana (VI.vii.90) and Naradiya Purana (lxvii.70) define kalpanƒÅ as a two-termed relation which is a distinction between the contemplation and the object-to-be-contemplated. Badarayana has used the word kalpanƒÅ only once in his composition, Brahma Sutras, but while translating Sri Govinda BhƒÅshya of Baladeva Vidyabhushana, a commentary on VedƒÅnta sutras, this word has been translated by Srisa Chandra Vasu to mean ‚Äì 'the creative power of thought, formation, creation (and not imagination) ', which meaning is in the context of explaining Pradhana purported to have been referred to by the word - ajƒÅ (birthless entity) occurring in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (IV.5). Badarayana states:- :‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§®‡•ã‡§™‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§ö ‡§ö, ‡§Æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§¶‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß‡§É :\\"Because it is taught that Pradhana is the creation of the Lord, so there is no contradiction in calling her both created and uncreated, as in the case of honey (a reference to Madhu-vidya).\\" Roer in his translation of the commentary of Shankara on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has translated the word kalpanƒÅ as 'fictitious view', and upadhi , as 'fictitious attribute'. Shankara in his Brahma Sutra BhƒÅsya has interpreted this sutra as follows:- :\\"And since this is an instruction in the form of an imagery, just as in the case of honey etc., therefore there is no incongruity.\\" (Translated by Swami Gambhirananda) explaining that the word ajƒÅ neither indicates the form of a she-goat nor has it been used in the derivative sense of that which is unborn; what is said by the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is as an instruction about the material source of all things ‚Äì moving and immobile, using a form of imagery (kalpanƒÅ) - the analogy to a she-goat. DignƒÅga in his PramƒÅna-samuccya, tells us that amongst pratyaksha ('perception') that has the particular for the object and anumƒÅna ('inference') that has only the universal cognisance, the former ('perception') is free from kalpanƒÅ or 'conceptual construction'. Katha Upanishad tells us that virtual objects exist only during kalpanƒÅ-kƒÅla i.e. during the period of imagination, owing to avidyƒÅ . And, according to Patanjali, kalpanƒÅ ('fancy') is more subjective than illusion and hallucination. Man is able to think because he has a perceiving and arranging manas ('mind') which self-illuminated gives him chetnƒÅ ('consciousness') and the faculties of pratyaksha ('perception'), chintƒÅ ('thought'), kalpanƒÅ ('imagination'), prayatna ('volition') and chaitanya ('higher sentience and intelligence'). The Vedic thinkers held the view that the universe is merely an idea, a kalpanƒÅ ('phantasm') or projection of the mind of the creator; even the experience of birth and death by the Jiva is a kalpanƒÅ ('hallucination') created by ignorance. Mental kalpanƒÅ is false superimposition on account of ignorance. However, the siddha , exclusively intent on attaining yoga with own self, and self-reliant, gains powers arising spontaneously as devoid of any ruse or ploy (kalpanƒÅ).

For much of its existence its full title was The Mount Barker Courier and Onkaparinga and Gumeracha Advertiser, later shortened to The Mount Barker Courier. History The newspaper was founded as The Mount Barker Courier and Onkaparinga and Gumeracha Advertiser on 1 October 1880, price 3d. (3 pence) for 4 pages.Front page of the first issue. Charles M. R. Dumas was sole proprietor, and its offices were on Gawler Street, Mount Barker. Publication continued every Friday morning. In 1893 tentative moves were made to introduce an alternative title Mount Barker Courier and Southern Advertiser, but somehow the \\"less cumbrous title\\" never made it to the front page. The newspaper later absorbed another publication, printed by Lancelot Ramsay Thomson, the Mannum Mercury and Farmer's Journal (30 March 1912 - 2 March 1917). Dumas, who was for four years Member for Mount Barker, died on 19 February 1935, and his family kept it running until May 1938, when it was taken over by T. H. Monger, previously owner of the Tasmanian King Island News. In 1909 Dumas opened a printery in Murray Bridge, and started a newspaper there, the River Murray Advocate, but by the start of 1911 the Advocate existed only as a single page supplement in the Courier. Monger's period of eight years, ending in March 1946, was short but eventful, encompassing World War II. The next owners were E. L. Perry and H. Edmondson. From 1952 the proprietors were F. T. Marston and E. L. Perry, and publisher was Norman E. K. Marston. In 1954, the last year which can be examined on-line using Trove, the newspaper's title was virtually unchanged, it had 10 pages, was published on Wednesdays and cover price was 4d. In 1960, the paper was abbreviated to The Mount Barker Courier, and to simply The Courier by 1983. Today , the paper has never missed a print run and is still in the hands of the same family, the Marstons. Its circulation is around 7,500 (down from 15,000 in its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s). Norm Marston, son of the proprietor since 1952 and now over 91 years old, is very likely Australia's oldest active regional newspaper owner and editor. Four generations of the family have worked at the press. Special features A series of interest to lovers of local history, A Jewel Casket by \\"P.W\\" began in March 1947 and ran as a (mostly) weekly feature through to June 1950. The author's identity was never revealed beyond that of being a friend of the editor. The author made no secret of his support for John Wrathall Bull in the Bull v. Ridley header priority controversy. The State Library of South Australia has identified the author as Percy Whitington, who later wrote on local history for the Murray Valley Standard. Notable editors Charles Richard Wilton (25 May 1855 ‚Äì 8 March 1927), editor from 1881, left for Melbourne in 1889 to take up a position with the short-lived Daily Telegraph. then the longtime literary editor of the Adelaide Advertiser. But he maintained his connection with The Courier, contributing for 36 years, as \\"Autolycus\\", a weekly column noted for its incisive wit. James McCullum was editor for six months in 1889, leaving for a sub-editorship with the Silver Age in Broken Hill. G.F. Harrison became associate editor of the Melbourne Age. I.J. Osterman was editor from 1996. Norm Marston is managing editor as of May 2020.

Launched on 18 June 1969 and successful by the 27th, the assault by People's Army of Vietnam troops from the 312th Division and sappers of the 13th Dac Cong Battalion captured Muang Soui. Although the defenders outnumbered the assailants by three to one, the only hard surfaced airfield near the Plain of Jars would fall to the communists, depriving the defending Royal Lao Government of its only forward fighter-bomber base. Campaign Toan Thang was an effective riposte to the Royalist attacks of Operation Pigfat and the U.S. Air Force Operation Raindance. The Vietnamese victory at Muang Soui left them firmly in command of the war in northern Laos. Overview After World War II, France fought the First Indochina War to retain French Indochina. As part of its loss of that war at Dien Ben Phu, it freed the Kingdom of Laos. Laotian neutrality was established in the 1954 Geneva Agreements. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì12, 15‚Äì18. A North Vietnamese-backed communist insurrection began as early as 1949. Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30-34. As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency established a secret guerrilla army in the Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought to hold on to their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos.Warner, pp. 44‚Äì47 After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng. As a riposte, Hmong General Vang Pao plotted another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists. However, the communists beat him to it.Warner, p. 264.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 210‚Äì211.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 298, 300. Campaign Toan Thang After his spoiling attacks in Operation Pigfat, Operation Raindance, and Operation Stranglehold had limited results during early 1969, during the third week of June 1969, the Hmong general was planning yet another incursion into enemy territory. Vang Pao had not only suffered the reverses of his failed offensives, as well as the loss of a forward airfield at Muang Soui; his defensive position was further weakened by Vietnamese communist attacks. Faced with the looming possibility of a final guerrilla defeat, American Ambassador William H. Sullivan and Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma had loosened the restrictive rules of engagement inherent in the Operation Barrel Roll bombing campaign, to little effect.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 207‚Äì209. An arc of militia outposts at Lima Sites served as a picket line for the guerrilla army as Vang Pao planned.Anthony, Sexton, p. 302 The PT-76 amphibious tank (example shown) was used by the People's Army of Vietnam attack on Muang Soui, 24 June 1969. That was the first use of armor in northern Laos during the Laotian Civil War. However, the People's Army of Vietnam spoiled Vang Pao's plans with Operation Toan Thang (Total Victory). They finally had the use of an all-weather supply line, Route 7; a second one, Route 72, was nearly complete. Previous rainy seasons had hampered PAVN mobility with muddy trails and bogged logistics; during breaks in the weather, the opposing Royalists had conducted heliborne offensive operations backed by air support. Now the PAVN simply slipped past the Lima site outposts unseen. For the first time in northern Laos, they used armor, launching ten PT-76 light amphibious tanks as part of their 18 June 1969 assault on Muang Soui as part of the first-ever communist wet weather attack. By 24 June, they had surrounded the base, whose 4,000 defenders outnumbered them by a three to one ratio. PAVN infantry posted to the predawn attack force included the 165th Regiment of the 312th Division, as well as the sappers of the 13th Dac Cong Battalion. The Forces Armee Neutral troops at the Phou Kout outpost scattered under the assault. By dawn, Toan Thang closed in on Neutralist Paratroop Battalion 85 at Ban Khay, where they defended Muang Soui. The assailants went in behind six tanks. Despite being hit with 77 sorties of tactical air that disabled four of the PT-76s, they carried the day. After two killed and 64 wounded, the defenders withdrew to the western edge of the artillery park, abandoning three 155mm and five 105mm guns to the communists. With Hmong \\"stiffeners\\" assigned, as well as close air support homing in on the enemy, the Neutralists held. The Thai artillerists with them resorted to direct fire of their 105mm howitzers at the advancing foe's armor. That night, U.S. Air Force AC-47 gunships flew watch over the site.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 211‚Äì213.Ahern, p. 318. Foul weather plagued 25 June; only 11 sorties of tactical air struck in support of the Royalists. There was a lull in the fighting, during which Neutralists began to drift away from the battlefield. The day passed in relative quiet. On the morning of 26 June, the U.S. Army attach√© decided to evacuate Neutralist dependents from the base. Someone dubbed the operation Swan Lake. When the coming evacuation became known, Neutralist soldiers began to drift away southwards toward Xieng Dat. The poor weather continued on the 26th, and air support was limited to 13 sorties. A scratch fleet of 24 helicopters was gathered for the evacuation. There were 11 Air America H-34s, as well as choppers from the 20th and 21st Special Operations Squadron, and the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. However, once their families were removed, the Neutralist soldiers began to depart to the south, leaving the Thais on their own. Special Requirements 8, the mercenary Thai artillery battalion, was increasingly on its own. By evening, only 500 FAN soldiers were still present. During the night, 200 of them slipped away. Thai General Phytoon Inkatanawat helicoptered into the besieged position on the 26th, as did several senior officers from the Royal Lao Army. Water and munitions also were helilifted in. However, by evening, only 500 Neutralists remained. The visiting brass spent the night under heavy incoming artillery fire. By morning, 200 more Neutralists had deserted. The visitors met with four Project 404 American advisors to the Thais at dawn on 27 June. After bitter argument, because the Thais wanted to stand and fight, an evacuation was planned for 1445 hours. Improved weather allowed strikes during the day; 21 USAF and 15 RLAF sorties hit the foe. Then, under enemy fire, about 200 dependents were removed, along with 231 Thai and 51 Hmong. Others left the site on foot, overwatched by an AC-47 gunship. At 1645 hours, the last friendly troops departed, leaving Ban Khay to the communists. One helicopter was lost to PAVN fire, but its crew was rescued. Muang Soui had fallen. Aftermath As part of its bomb damage assessment, the U.S. Air Force and Royal Lao Air Force sorties had accounted for seven of the ten attacking tanks by the day of the evacuation. Bombing would continue to strike the foe through 30 June; much abandoned friendly equipment was destroyed along with the enemy. Now that it controlled the Plain of Jars, a communist probe extended down Route 7 past Muang Soui. It briefly cut the only road between Vientiane and Luang Prabang on 28 June. In losing Muang Soui, Vang Pao and the Royal Lao Government had lost a hard surfaced airstrip that was extremely useful for forward staging of RLAF T-28s for strike missions.Warner, p. 267. Its loss was considered critical and a counterattack to recapture the airfield was considered essential to keep the communists off balance.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 303‚Äì304. Special Requirements 8 returned to Thailand, to be disbanded some months later. With a record 19 battalions of PAVN in or around the Plain of Jars, well furnished with supplies by Route 7, the communists appeared able to carry out such operations as they wished.

They were described as a \\"band of men\\" who could \\"preach like Apostles\\" and \\"ride like cowboys\\". History The St Andrew's Bush Brotherhood was established in 1897 in Longreach, Queensland, by the Bishop of Stepney, Canon Body and the Bishop of Rockhampton, Nathaniel Dawes. The first group of brothers was led by the Reverend George Halford. The Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd was established about 1903 in Dubbo, New South Wales. The Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd published The Bush Brother magazine from 1904 to 1980. The Bush Brotherhood of St Boniface operated in the Diocese of Bunbury in Western Australia from July 1911 to 1929. In 1922, Bryan Robin published a book \\"The Sundowner\\" about his experiences in the Bush Brotherhood of St Barnabas in North Queensland from 1914 to 1921. This book attracted other priests to join the brotherhood. The Brotherhood of St John the Baptist was established in Murray Bridge, South Australia. The Bush Brotherhood of St Paul operated in Charleville and Cunnamulla in Queensland. Operation of the orders There were a number of different orders of Bush Brothers, but all operated on a similar basis of an almost monastic life, committed to: * temporary vows of poverty, chastity and obedience * periodic returns from the bush to a community house for spiritual replenishment * obedience to a warden or principal (often a bishop) Their duties included: * giving religious instruction in schools * holding services * administering sacraments The Bush Brothers were either single (or left their wives behind during their period of service). Many were recruited from England where life in the Outback had a romantic appeal. Australian brothers were less frequently recruited.

He rides after them on his horse, but is stopped when he sees a boy named Silver (Benjamin Petry) fall off his horse spooked by a rattlesnake. West shoots the rattlesnake's rattler off and it retreats into the bushes. Silver's arm is dislocated, but West fixes it. Silver asks him if he's a doctor, but West declines. Silver tells West that the bandits headed for Holysand, the nearest town. When they arrive in Holysand, they discover a fire in the middle of town set by Silver's stepfather and rancher, Nathan Mitchell (Boots Southerland). Nathan argues with a rival rancher, Victor Baker (Adam Taylor) about burning the bags of seed that Nathan bought. The argument is broken up by Sheriff Roy Basehart (Paul Sorvino) and the local school teacher Denise Stark (Clare Carey). Nathan's ranch hand, Garvey (Alessio di Clemente) orders Silver to clean it up. West walks into the saloon turning everyone's head, because he is new. Instead of ordering whiskey he orders tea, causing everyone to ridicule him. Garvey offers him a seat and a round of poker. West wins a hand, but Garvey accuses him of cheating. The sheriff arrests West and locks him up and Garvey keeps West's money. Later that night Silver tells people about how West fixed his arm. When the sheriff tells West about his back pain, he suggests getting new boots. The next morning Nathan's daughter, Millie (Mary Petruolo) who West met in the post office, arrives in Holysand and is greeted by her childhood friends Burt Baker (Micah Alberti) and Jack Baker (Linus Huffman). The sheriff has no more back pain due to his new boots. West also gives Stark a remedy to heal her sick friend. Millie reunites with her grandmother Melody, Nathan, and Silver. Nathan tells Jack and Burt to stay away from Millie because of his rivalry with their father. After a conversation with the sheriff, Nathan leaves but not before Silver gives West an apple pie (which they talked about earlier in the film). West and the sheriff play a game of poker. After the sheriff wins, West tells him that he was a doctor, but he accidentally killed a patient while drunk. He also says that he takes care of her daughter, Estrella who he sends money to every month. He still continues to doctor, but vowed never to drink or touch a scalpel. The Baker brothers set the seed salesman Sam's (Harry Zimmerman) clothes on fire and are arrested, causing the town to laugh. West is released and with the help of Nathan, gets his money back from Garvey. Millie learns about Nathan's marriage to a woman named Dana, upsetting her. He also explains that the Bakers are their enemies, as they fight over a piece of land. Victor's barn mysteriously burns down. He blames Nathan and bails his sons out of jail. In Santa Fe West is going to send money to Estrella and the bank teller declares they are all marked with \\"E\\" (for Estrella) and West realizes something. Meanwhile, Millie wants her father and Victor to get along and asks help from Stark. West tells the sheriff that Garvey gave him the stolen money, indicating that Garvey was one of the bandits in Santa Fe. West gets a room at the saloon and plans to stay until Garvey is behind bars. Millie talks with Burt and Jack and decide to keep their friendship a secret from their fathers. Stark's dog, Big steals West's pan of beans and leads him to her house. He eventually lets Big have them and for the first time, the dog shows affection towards anyone. West and Stark have dinner and West retires. The next morning Millie thinks that Nathan burned down the Baker's barn and storms off. Nathan discovers that the water pump for his cattle is sabotaged, causing him to think Victor did it. Silver tells West that Garvey was not in Holysand the day of the robbery that he takes three days off every month. Victor challenges Nathan to a gunfight but West shoots the guns out of their hands. Garvey attempts to challenge West, but the sheriff stops him. West decides to settle who claims the land by a boxing in the center of Holysand. Victor and Nathan refuse, but the sheriff reminds that blood will be spilled if they don't agree. West teaches Burt and Jack along with their friend Larry exercise before boxing. Burt and Millie's friendship turns into a romance, causing Jack to be jealous. Burt can only kick but not box and Jack takes his anger out on the beanbag that they punch. Jack is so strong that a beam comes down and knocks West unconscious. Stark nurses West back to health and West continues training the Bakers. The sheriff tells West that every time Garvey took days off there were robberies, confirming Garvey was one of the thieves. At the tournament there are no guns or eye-gouging allowed. The fight begins and the Bakers win. Garvey sneaks off to his horse and reveals a stashed gun under his saddle. This reveals that Garvey burned Victor's barn down and sabotaged Nathan's water pump to cause conflict. He steals the sheriff's gun and challenges West again to a gunfight. West shoots him and walks away. Garvey survives and tries to kill him, but Silver jumps in front of him and takes the bullet. West shoots and kills Garvey. West refuses to do surgery after Estrella's mother died at his hands, but Stark encourages him to do so. Silver is saved and Nathan thanks him. West is self-awakened and he and Stark share a kiss. West leaves the next morning, but a Mexican farmer asks for help. His wife is in labor and is dying. Silver rides after him and West rolls his eyes.

They are classified as N-carboxyanhydrides or NCAs. Typically these compounds are derived from amino acids by treatment with triphosgene. They are white solids, prone to polymerization upon treatment with nucleophiles.

The relatively high temperatures necessary for this cyclization results in the decomposition of several NCAs. Of several improvements, one notable procedure involves treating an unprotected amino acid with phosgene or its trimer. center  Use in peptide synthesis  NCAs are used for peptide synthesis. Additionally, peptide synthesis reactions with NCAs does not require protection of the amino acid functional groups. NCA's are however highly reactive and their use can cogenerate many side products. N-substituted NCAs, such as sulfenamide derivatives, solve some of these problems. NCA's are precursors to amino acid homopolymers. Ephraim Katzir first used this method to synthesize poly-L-lysine from N-carbobenzyloxy-Œ±-N-carboxy-L-lysine anhydride, followed by deprotection with phosphonium iodide.  NCAs in siRNA delivery platform synthesis  One major drawback of siRNA-based therapies is that they lack sufficient in-vivo delivery of siRNA into the target cells because of the large size and negative charge density of siRNA. Efficient transfer of siRNA to the liver has been achieved by lipid nanoparticles, polymer conjugates, and peptide conjugates. One of the major challenges of current methods of transfer is the nonbiodegradability of the vessel once it is inside the body. This challenge is solved by using biodegradable poly(amide) polymers derived from polymerization of NCAs. Imine-NCA condensation NCAs have been used for the synthesis of imidazolidinones, which are of interest in the pharmaceutical industry.

It was built from 1869 to 1890s. It is also known as Avondale & Macleod aviation site, Beechwood, Glen Ross, and Seventeen Mile Rocks School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Sinnamon family arrived at Brisbane via Tasmania in 1863. James aged 50 was a well established Northern Ireland farmer of Huguenot origin. With his wife Margaret, seven sons and three daughters, he emigrated for economic betterment and religious freedom. In 1865 the family, including another daughter born en route, settled at Seventeen Mile Rocks on the Mermaid Reach of the Brisbane River. This area, which had been surveyed into small farms in 1864, sold rapidly due to economic buoyancy and peak immigration during the early 1860s. To the initial parcel of 20 acres (portion 302) purchased from William Lovell in 1865, James added adjacent allotments from other vendors. Since land along much of the river was dense sub-tropical rainforest or vine scrub, the family had to clear sufficient farm land by felling and firing. On portion 299 (acquired by James Sinnamon in 1866), the family built a large split slab hut with earthen floor. In addition to using their government land orders totalling ¬£216, the Sinnamons borrowed money for capital improvements, which was repaid within several years. By 1869 they were able to build the more commodious, handsawn timber house further up the hill, known as Beechwood (portion 302). To construct Beechwood, the family cut and hauled timber from the property to their nearby sawpit. During a hauling trip James was fatally injured when kicked by a horse. His widow Margaret and family completed the building and carried on farming, later erecting other buildings for farming and family purposes. John, the eldest and unmarried son, resided at Beechwood with his mother until her death in 1904 aged 83 and his own demise ten years later. Beechwood has been occupied continuously since 1869, and together with Wolston House (1863) at Wacol, remains one of the oldest residences in the district. In 1887 a third and more substantial residence, Glen Ross, was constructed to the west of Beechwood on portion 301 for James Jr, the sixth child of James and Margaret Sinnamon, who had acquired title to the land in 1880. James Jr married in December 1887, and the new house, named Glen Ross in reference to the family home in Ireland, was extended over time to accommodate six sons and three daughters. A substantial hay shed was erected on the Glen Ross farm , but was burnt down in 1978. After James Jr died in 1942 aged 91, the farming property was purchased, occupied and augmented by their fourth child, Hercules V Sinnamon (later Sir Hercules), a businessman and farmer. HV Sinnamon placed shareholders on the land and continued to maintain the Sinnamon farms. A fourth residence, Avondale, on portion 304 to the east of Beechwood, was erected in the 1890s for Benjamin Sinnamon, the ninth child, who purchased the property in 1886 from other family members. He married Elizabeth Annie Primrose in 1889, and they and their six children resided at Avondale. Following Benjamin's death in 1941, the property continued operating on a share farm basis. George, the third of James and Margaret Sinnamon's children, purchased Rosemount, a sixteen-acre property on the opposite side of Seventeen Mile Rocks Road, where an avenue of mango trees remains (portion 313). Rosemount burnt down about 1970, after which the property was presented to the Methodist Church, which erected the Sinnamon Retirement Village on the site. Altogether the Sinnamon farms produced a wide range of primary produce, commencing with sugarcane and cotton, then maize, potatoes, pineapples and dairy produce, while concentrating in later years on breeding horses and cattle, especially pure jersey stock. The Sinnamon family also took a leading part in local affairs, in particular with the establishment of the Seventeen Mile Rocks School and the local church (Sinnamon Memorial Uniting Church), and Benjamin Sinnamon served on the Sherwood Shire Council. As children in the Seventeen Mile Rocks area had to journey to Corinda to school, a provisional school was built in Goggs Road as early as 1870. This building of split timber with furnishings was supplied by local farmers in accordance with the Education Act of the same year. By 1876 local residents had collected sufficient funds to erect a new school facing Goggs Road on the southeast corner of portion 316, about south of the original site. This building was completed in 1877 by Wilson Henry, local resident and cousin to the Sinnamon family, and opened at the beginning of the 1878 school year with 32 pupils. The schoolhouse was complemented by a detached shelter shed and a teacher's residence. In the early 1900s the interior of the schoolhouse was lined with narrow tongue and groove boards and its shingled roof was replaced with corrugated galvanised iron. The school finally closed in 1966, when Jindalee State School opened. The building was sold subsequently to Hercules Sinnamon, who offered it as headquarters for the Indooroopilly Rural Youth Club. Generations of the Sinnamon family had attended the school and been involved in its development, particularly HV Sinnamon's father, James Jr, who was the school committee's first treasurer, and his uncle Benjamin, who was chairman of the school committee for forty years. The school (without its teacher's residence) was moved from crown land to HV Sinnamon's property in the late 1980s and has been used since by school groups as an interactive museum. Sinnamon Farm was the venue for pioneering glider flights and the first officially observed flight in Queensland of a heavier-than-air machine, undertaken by Thomas Macleod on the slopes of portions 303 and 298 in 1910. These events were commemorated in 1970 by the erection of a plaque adjacent to the now relocated school. From the 1960s some Sinnamon land was sold for inclusion in the new suburb of Jindalee, but all of the family property between Seventeen Mile Rocks Road and the Brisbane River was retained, principally through the efforts of HV Sinnamon. In order to preserve his family's history and heritage in the Seventeen Mile Rocks area, HV Sinnamon opposed the proposal for a cross-river bridge through the remaining farmland, shifted the threatened former state school onto his property, and published a history of the Sinnamon family. In the mid-1960s he also donated land for the relocation of the threatened Seventeen Mile Rocks Church. In 1994, HV Sinnamon died at the age of 94 years. Despite Hercules Sinnamon's commitment to retaining the area as farmland, after his death, the land was sold for development of residential housing estates. In 2011 a masterplan was created to redevelop the heritage-listed buildings Glen Ross, Beechwood and the former Seventeen Mile Rocks School as residences with work underway in 2014.  Description  Sinnamon Farm comprises all of the buildings, structures, sites, objects, planting and land associated with the Sinnamon family within the heritage register boundary. This includes the following: * Beechwood (1869), a gable-roofed, verandahed house and planting. This farm house comprises four bedrooms and a parlour, and is a typical timber dwelling of the Separation period, although the detached kitchen and stables no longer exist. The front and back verandah roofs are joined continuously to the main gable roof, its split hardwood shingles now covered by corrugated galvanised iron. The front verandah is plainly furnished with square stick balustrading. Four pairs of French doors open onto this verandah. The house is constructed of pitswan timber, adzed and otherwise shaped on the property. This includes internal cedar joinery, and hardwood log bearers which run the width of the house on stumps, their ends protruding beyond the walls. The rear verandah or skillion has been modified. The early formal garden has long gone, but several old Bunya pines line the river front. * Glen Ross (1887), a short ridge- roofed, verandahed house and attached kitchen house, with outbuildings, fencing and formal garden. The residence to the west of Beechwood is a typical late 19th century Queensland house. Beneath its short-ridge roof of corrugated galvanised iron and rear extension are twelve rooms, a number of which have been created by enclosing parts of the encircling verandahs. Wide front and side verandahs are ornamented with cast iron balustrading and brackets between timber posts, and the rear verandah has simple dowel balustrading. The exposed stud frame of the main house, which is lined on the inside with vertical tongue and groove boards, is accentuated by a large cross brace on either side of each four-paned sash window. Joinery throughout is of cedar. Two chimneys serve fireplaces in the parlour and the present kitchen. The attached former kitchen house has a separate corrugated iron hipped roof and verandahs to each side, but the western verandah is enclosed. This wing is clad in weatherboards, and retains its brick chimney at the northern end. The whole house is complemented internally by period furnishings and family mementoes, and externally by timber fencing and planting. The latter comprises a formal front garden, rear vegetable beds, an orchard to the east including persimmon and a large Moreton Bay fig tree near the front gate. To the west a group of outbuildings provides shelter for various vehicles and implements, including the early Sinnamon family plough of bush timber and iron share. An adjacent shed of vertical slabs survives, as well as more recent structures. Glen Ross is an intact, cohesive and maintained farm house which retains its original character and has been extended sympathetically over time to accommodate a family on the land. * Avondale (s), a short ridge-roofed, verandahed house, with outbuildings. To the east of Beechwood is Avondale, another late 19th century Queensland farmhouse which is similar in form to Glen Ross. Built of timber and corrugated iron, Avondale has wide verandahs on all sides and is ornamented with cast iron balustrading, brackets, and a small cast-iron valance between the timber posts. The rear and parts of the side verandahs have been enclosed. Its exposed stud frame, which is lined on the inside with vertical tongue and groove boards, is accentuated by a large cross brace on either side of each four-paned sash window. Avondale has fewer main rooms than Glen Ross, and the walls of four inch vertically jointed boards and the rear projection indicate a later construction period. Outbuildings to the west include an old slab and corrugated iron barn with a recent extension. There are the stone remnants of a circular horse-powered mill race to the west of the house. * Former Seventeen Mile Rocks School (1877), a relocated gable- roofed, verandahed building, with shelter shed. The one-roomed school building now set on a concrete block base was typical for a rural locality. It is an unadorned, front and back verandahed, gable roofed structure with weatherboard cladding and a corrugated galvanised iron roof. The ceiling is lined with diagonal tongue and groove sheeting and the interior walls are lined with narrow vertically jointed tongue and groove boards. The original front window sashes have been replaced with casements. Early furnishings include student desks and benches. The schoolhouse is complemented by a detached hip-roofed, corrugated iron-covered shelter shed. * Macleod aviation site (1910), location of the pioneering glider flights and first officially observed flight in Queensland of a heavier-than-air machine by Thomas Macleod (on the slopes of portions 303 and 298), as commemorated by a plaque (1970) adjacent to the now relocated school.  Heritage listing  Sinnamon Farm was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Sinnamon Farm is significant historically because it illustrates the early phase of rural settlement and land use which took place along reaches of the Brisbane River and other Queensland waterways from the 1860s to the 1890s, especially the clearing of rainforest for \\"scrub farms\\", the ensuing pattern of farming, and the growth of community life centred on the family, school and church. In particular, the farm survives as illustration of the evolution, association and location within a single family of a small grouping of farm dwellings, outbuildings and associated community buildings. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The buildings, structures, sites, objects, and plantings of Sinnamon Farm form a rare rural grouping within a late 20th century suburban district in Brisbane, and are important in illustrating a past way of life. As a farming landscape, with a developmental sequence of 19th century buildings and structures, Sinnamon Farm forms a rare and distinctive grouping in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The principal buildings and structures of Sinnamon Farm include a gable-roofed house of the late 1860s, two 1880s-90s residences, slab outbuildings and an 1870s gable-roofed schoolhouse. These are typical timber buildings of what was once rural Queensland, and in their intactness are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of their type. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Sinnamon Farm is important for its strong association with the Sinnamon family, which has been prominent in local affairs, the development of the district and many other fields of public endeavour since the 1860s.

Opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers, to the remnants of a Native American village and battlements, due to the site's similarity to the description found in the account of √âtienne Br√ªl√© of a settlement called Carantouan. The area in the hill's vicinity was previously occupied by Susquehannock Native Americans. It was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology, as well as relic hunting. The source of the name remains unknown, but various theories have been proposed as to its origin.  Geography  A sketch of Spanish Hill, including a diagram of its structures. The double lines indicate portions still visible in 1898, while the dotted line represents what the author believed to be a palisade. In 1795, Fran√ßois Alexandre Fr√©d√©ric visited Spanish Hill while en route to Canada. He described the hill as \\"a mountain in the shape of a sugar loaf, about 100 feet high, with level top, on which are remains of intrenchments. One perpendicular breastwork is still remaining, plainly indicating a parapet and ditch.\\" In 1833, another individual visiting the hill described \\"the remains of a wall which runs around the whole exactly on the brow, and within a deep ditch or intrenchment running round the whole summit.\\" In 1898, I.P. Shepard created a sketch of Spanish Hill, including the portions still visible at the time as well as those no longer extant. Shepard enlisted the assistance of a longtime local resident, Charles Henry Shepard, who claimed to remember \\"fortifications as consisting of an embankment with a trench behind, giving a height of four or five feet on the inside.\\" In addition, an indent was discovered on the site which was pronounced to be a corn cache by Beauchamp. According to John S. Clark, a surveyor and historian active in the area until the early twentieth century, the topography and size of the site were appropriate to correspond with Br√ªl√©'s description of Carantouan; Br√ªl√© described a palisaded town, populated by approximately 800 warriors and 4,000 individuals in total. He also described the dwellings and fortifications as being similar to those utilized by the Wyandot people. Clark's conclusions were based in part on surveys he conducted at the site in 1878, when he observed what he believed were fortifications atop the hill. Amateur archaeologist Ellsworth C. Cowles conducted an excavation at the base of the hill in 1932, uncovering what he described as \\"seventy five postholes extending east and west,\\" as well as the \\"effigy of a huge animal.\\"  History  Projectile points and various other Native American artifacts found at the Spanish Hill site Originally created by receding glaciers, Spanish Hill comprises approximately of earth in a site that is part of the Sayre quadrangle. Located at an elevation of above sea level, it rises approximately over the nearby floodplain of the Chemung River. The hill is located in South Waverly, Pennsylvania, in Bradford County, just south of the state border with New York, inside of territory once occupied by the Susquehannock people. It has been acknowledged and studied by historians and archaeologists for over two hundred years. The source of the name is unknown, but individuals traveling through the area between 1795 and 1804 described \\"Spanish Ramparts\\" as a feature of the hill, and some of the earliest settlers to the region report that local Native Americans referred to the hill either as \\"Hispan\\" or \\"Espan.\\" In 1615, √âtienne Br√ªl√© was sent to the area by Samuel de Champlain to meet with Native American tribes in the hope of finding assistance to fight the Iroquois, against whom Champlain had allied with the Wyandot people. During his voyage, Br√ªl√© recorded a town called Carantouan (meaning \\"Big Tree,\\" according to ethnologist William Martin Beauchamp), which was subsequently included on a map published by de Champlain in 1632. In the early nineteenth-century, a Native American man who lived in the area near Spanish Hill reportedly refused to ascend it, for fear of a deadly spirit that lived on top. According to the man, the spirit spoke with a thunderous voice and \\"made holes through Indians' bodies.\\" Archaeologist Louise Welles Murray suggested that this could be a reference to cannon or musket fire. In the early twentieth century, archaeological and historical research was conducted regarding a potential connection between Carantouan and the structures described on the hill. After surveying the area in spring and fall, archaeologist L.D. Shoemaker discovered evidence of Native American habitation, including shell heaps, corn and flint chips, along with various other implements. In 1918, historian and archaeologist George P. Donehoo, after a survey of the site, determined that it was impossible for Spanish Hill to have been the site of the town described by Br√ªl√©. He cited the sharp incline, which would have made ascension difficult, as well as the lack of water and archaeological evidence on the hill as evidence against it having been the location of Carantouan. Speculation that Spanish Hill was the site of the village was also countered by James Bennett Griffin, who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in 1931. However, historian Deb Twigg suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth-century archaeologist Warren Moorehead, as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area may have contributed to the lack of artifacts found during the Griffin expedition. As Twig wrote: ‚ÄúUntil more information is known, it seems imprudent to eliminate Spanish Hill as a possible site related to the nation of Carantouan, as some researchers have done.‚Äù The site was a popular location, both for archaeological excavations and amateur collecting. According to Twigg, Spanish Hill was \\"looted\\" by Moorehead, and his finds likely sold to collectors. In addition, the area was heavily scoured by relic collectors approximately since the early nineteenth-century. On October 15, 1915, the Historical Society of Bradford County, Pennsylvania, dedicated a memorial on Spanish Hill in honor of the tricentennial of the arrival of Br√ªl√© to the present-day border of Pennsylvania. Later, in 1939, Section of Painting and Sculpture artist Musa McKim depicted the hill in a mural entitled \\"Spanish Hill and the Early Inhabitants of the Vicinity,\\" for display in the United States Post Office branch of nearby Waverly, New York. The hill was nearly demolished and used for highway fill in 1970, but the efforts were reportedly halted due to lobbying by local amateur archaeologist Ellsworth Cowles.

It was built in 1888 by Wilson Henry. It is also known as Seventeen Mile Rocks Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  In 1888, this building replaced a small bark and shingle chapel erected in 1880 at the corner of Goggs and Seventeen Mile Rocks Road, adjacent to the former Seventeen Mile Rocks School. The builder was Wilson Henry, a local resident and a cousin to the Sinnamon family, pioneers of the Seventeen Mile Rocks area since the mid-1860s. The new building was intended for use by the Church of England, but as the church was unable to supply a clergyman, the congregation was served by the Primitive Methodist Church of Ipswich, whose minister arrived by rowboat. By the 1950s the congregation had dwindled to sisters Edith and Isobel Sinnamon. In 1966, the western extension of Seventeen Mile Rocks Road to the new suburb of Jindalee necessitated relocation of the building, which was moved onto land donated by Hercules V Sinnamon from the Sinnamon family's original 1865 holding. Two years later the chapel re-opened as the Rocks Road Sinnamon Memorial Methodist Church and though lacking a regular congregation, it served for occasional functions. In 1980, the church centenary was commemorated by the planting of pine trees around the perimeter. Since the Sinnamon family and their relatives had filled most church positions over the years, the building was aptly re-sited and renamed.  Description  This small chamferboard building sits on concrete stumps well back from Seventeen Mile Rocks Road, on a grassed site with recent perimeter pine plantings. It has a simple rectangular plan, with a small front porch. The high-pitched gabled main roof and front porch roof were shingled originally, but these have been replaced with corrugated iron. The ceiling is lined with six inch tongue and groove boards and the walls are strengthened by two iron tie-bars. The frame, which was exposed on the inside, is now boarded and sheeted internally. Early furnishings include four silver-plated kerosene lamps with tin shades, a medium-sized harmonium and a simple pulpit of vertically jointed cedar raised on a dais with two steps on either side. Seating only sixty persons on twelve pine pews (now painted), this was a typical small rural chapel.  Heritage listing  Sinnamon Memorial Uniting Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Rocks Road Sinnamon Memorial Uniting Church is significant for its social and spiritual role in the evolution of the Seventeen Mile Rocks area as a close-knit farming community in the second half of the 19th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is important for its contribution to a rare surviving rural landscape in Brisbane, created by a group of late 19th century farm houses, church, school and school house, other farm structures and farm land along Seventeen Mile Rocks Road and Goggs Road, within a highly planned late 20th century suburban district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building survives as a good example of a small, late 19th century rural chapel and retains a strong connection with the Seventeen Mile Rocks locality. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. In particular, the church has a close association with the Sinnamon family, who were amongst the earliest settlers in the district and have retained a strong presence in the area.

It was built from to by Allied Works Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The air raid shelter is built into the north face of the old Archerfield Quarry, or Carr's Quarry, in the southwest corner of the Mortimer Road Reserve, which is bounded by Mortimer Road and Beatty Road, Acacia Ridge. Archerfield remained largely undeveloped well into the twentieth century, being used for cattle grazing, fruit trees, cotton and maize cropping. A branch railway line reached the quarry, used to extract bluestone to be used for roads and ballast for the Kyogle railway line, in 1913, but the pit was flooded at the end of that year. Although it was closed after this event, the mine may have been used during the 1920s or 1930s. In 1922, there were about a dozen houses nearby, mostly along Beatty Road and the quarry branch line. In 1929, the Commonwealth Government resumed land at Archerfield for the construction of an airfield, and Archerfield Aerodrome later became an important base for the Australian, British, American and Dutch air forces during World War Two. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. Darwin was first bombed on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. While the American Forces were based at Archerfield, the area to the west of the intersection of Mortimer Road and Beatty Road was occupied by Camp Buckley, and large igloo hangars were built to the north of the quarry. A taxiway linking the igloos to the main aerodrome to the west passed close by the northern side of the quarry, and the air raid shelter was constructed to provide protection for military personnel stationed nearby. World War Two aerial photographs show that the water level in the quarry used to be below the rock shelf on which the shelter was built. They also indicate that the building was freestanding at that time, in the middle of a cleared platform. Earth has since collapsed or been moved onto the shelf around the bunker, giving it the appearance of having been built into the quarry wall. The quarry side of the bunker was protected by an outer curtain wall, which contained entrances to two tunnels leading into the main bunker. There was about a metre between the curtain wall and the edge of the rock shelf. The Allied Works Council Minutes of 8 January 1943 record that a bomb proof building for United States Air Corps Operations had been built near the American camp, and this may refer to the shelter in the quarry. At the end of the war military debris was dumped into the quarry. In 1963, the area was purchased by the Brisbane City Council for recreation purposes, and in 1992 amateur military historians partially drained the quarry, retrieving a number of military artefacts, including World War Two machine guns, ammunition, and aircraft parts. This operation also enabled an interior inspection of the shelter, which discovered that the two entrance tunnels are long, with doorways turning into the main bunker. The remains of four-inch thick wooden sliding doors were found, along with three one-foot diameter holes in the ceiling of the bunker. The present water level in the quarry prevents internal inspection.  Description  Partially submerged Air Raid Shelter in 2015 The Acacia Ridge air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete bunker built on a rock shelf cut into the north face of the former quarry. The currently exposed part of the bunker consists of two concrete walls, with a space between the two, running along part of the quarry face and returning into the quarry wall. The outer curtain wall is lower, is buttressed with concrete props, and has rectangular openings at each end. The inner bunker wall is shorter, taller, and has no visible openings. Only the top of the curtain wall is visible above the water in the quarry, and vegetation obscures the main bunker.  Heritage listing  Acacia Ridge Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Acacia Ridge air raid shelter is important as part of the Air Raid Precaution activities undertaken for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection for military personnel from the Archerfield aerodrome in the event of a Japanese air attack, the air raid shelter, located on a rock ledge in the north face of the Archerfield Quarry, is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. As a shelter that was built for military personnel, and which still includes its outer curtain wall, the Acacia Ridge shelter is uncommon. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, and its siting near a military installation, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two military air raid shelter.

The species is known from Oligocene to Miocene sediments exposed in Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington in the U.S. It is one of several extinct species belonging to the living section Rubra. Taxonomy Acer chaneyi is known from leaf and samara specimens which were recovered from a number of different formations in Western North America. The oldest occurrence is from the possibly Early Oligocene Gumboot Mountain flora of Southern Washington state followed by the Late Oligocene Kukak Bay flora in Alaska. In the early Miocene A. chaneyi is known from the Alaskan Kanalku Bay flora, Oregon Collawash and Little Butte flora. The Middle Miocene locations include the Skolai Creek flora of Alaska, Grand Coulee and Latah floras of Washington, Mascall flora and Succor Creek floras in Oregon and the Latah and Clarkia flora in Idaho. Further Middle Miocene occurrences in Nevada are the Thurston Ranch flora, Deadman Creek flora, Pyramid flora, Purple Mountain flora, Eastgate flora, and Middlegate floras. Late Miocene occurrences in Oregon are the Weyerhauser flora, Hidden Lake flora, Austin flora, Tipton flora, Stinking Water flora, and Trout Creek floras. Late Miocene occurrences in Idaho are the Cartwright Ranch flora, Horseshoe Bend flora, Alkali Creek flora and Trapper Creek flora. Based on the identified fossil occurrences A. chaneyi has a temporal range of approximately 20 million years, the longest identified for any fossil species in Western North America. The species Acer ferrignoi is a possible descendant species that survived in the Oregon Cascades until 7 million years ago. The nomenclatural history for A. chaneyi is fairly complex: a number of different names have been applied to the fossils of different locations. The species was reviewed by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University., in a 1987 paper in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The oldest name suggested for the fossils was Acer bendirei which was coined by Leo Lesquereux in 1883. The fossils used for his description of the species however were a mix of several different plants, and the type specimens were later transferred to the genus Platanus as P. bendirei. The next oldest name, Acer gigas, is from 1902 and was coined by Frank Knowlton for a fossil samara from the John Day formation. The fossil is missing the base of the fruit and the attachment scar, which is diagnostic for Acer: thus it was rejected by Wolfe and Tanai. Similarly they rejected A. grahamensis, for which the type specimen is also missing the attachment scar. They settled on A. chaneyi as the oldest valid species description, coined by Knowlton in 1926. Description Leaves of Acer chaneyi are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and are widely ovate to orbiculate in shape. The leaves are deeply dissected, occasionally into three lobes but more typically into five. The upper lateral lobes are two thirds as long as the median lobe, and all the lateral lobes are elliptic in outline. The leaves have between five and eleven secondary veins which diverge from the basal region of the primary vein at angles ranging from 25¬∞ to 50¬∞. The secondary veins arch towards the leaf margin in broadly convex to concave arches.

It premiered on 17 July 1717, in response to King George I's request for a concert on the River Thames. Structure The Water Music opens with a French overture and includes minuets, bourr√©es, and hornpipes. It is divided into three suites: Suite in F major (HWV 348) # Overture (Largo ‚Äì Allegro) # Adagio e staccato # Allegro ‚Äì Andante ‚Äì Allegro da capo Aria # Passepied # Air # Minuet # Bourr√©e # Hornpipe # Andante # Allegro # Hornpipe Suite in D major (HWV 349) # Overture (Allegro) # Alla Hornpipe # Lentement # Bourree # Minuet Suite in G major (HWV 350) # Sarabande # [Menuet Menuet Menuet Da Capo # Rigaudon Rigaudon Rigadon Da Capo # Gigue Gigue Gigue Da capo There is evidence for the different arrangement found in Chrysander's Gesellschaft edition of Handel's works (in volume 47, published in 1886), where the movements from the \\"suites\\" in D and G were mingled and published as one work with HWV 348. This sequence derives from Samuel Arnold's first edition of the complete score in 1788 and the manuscript copies dating from Handel's lifetime. Chrysander's edition also contains an earlier version of the first two movements of HWV 349 in the key of F major composed in 1715 (originally scored for two natural horns, two oboes, bassoon, strings, and continuo), where in addition to the horn fanfares and orchestral responses, the original version contained an elaborate concerto-like first violin part. (the piece is given its German title in this edition by Friedrich Chrysander, Leipzig 1886). The music in each of the suites has no set order today. First performance The first performance of the Water Music is recorded in The Daily Courant, the first British daily newspaper. At about 8 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 July 1717, King George I and several aristocrats boarded a royal barge at Whitehall Palace, for an excursion up the Thames toward Chelsea. The rising tide propelled the barge upstream without rowing. Another barge, provided by the City of London, contained about 50 musicians who performed Handel's music. Many other Londoners also took to the river to hear the concert. According to The Courant, \\"the whole River in a manner was covered\\" with boats and barges. On arriving at Chelsea, the king left his barge, then returned to it at about 11 p.m. for the return trip. The king was so pleased with Water Music that he ordered it to be repeated at least three times, both on the trip upstream to Chelsea and on the return, until he landed again at Whitehall., cited by . King George's companions in the royal barge included Anne Vaughan, Duchess of Bolton, Harriet Pelham-Holles, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, Sophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Darlington, Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, and George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney. Handel's orchestra is believed to have performed from about 8 p.m. until well after midnight, with only one break while the king went ashore at Chelsea. It was rumoured that the Water Music was composed to help King George refocus London attention from his son and heir (later George II of Great Britain), who, worried that his time to rule would be shortened by his father's long life, threw lavish parties and dinners to compensate for it; the Water Music's first performance on the Thames was the King's way of reminding London that he was still there and showing he could carry out gestures even grander than his son's. Subsequent performances The Water Music is scored for a relatively large orchestra, making it suitable for outdoor performance. It is also performed in indoor concerts and has been regularly programmed. In 1920 the Irish musician Hamilton Harty made an arrangement of some of the movements for the modern orchestra. Holden, R. (2011, May 19). Retrieved 16 Feb. 2019 (subscription or UK public library membership required)Kennedy, Michael. \\"Harty, Sir Hamilton\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 December 2011 Such re- orchestrations were normal at the time. According to the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham: In recent years, performers have tended to avoid versions such as that of Hamilton Harty, being influenced by ideas regarding historically informed performance. Legends Legend has it that Handel composed Water Music to regain the favour of King George I. Handel had been employed by the future king George while he was still Elector of Hanover, before he succeeded to the British throne. The composer supposedly fell out of favour for moving to London during Queen Anne's reign. This story was first related by Handel's early biographer John Mainwaring; although it may have some foundation in fact, the tale as told by Mainwaring has been doubted by some Handel scholars. Another legend has it that the Elector of Hanover approved of Handel's permanent move to London, knowing the separation between them would be temporary. Both were aware the Elector of Hanover would eventually succeed to the British throne after Queen Anne's death.. Popular culture and the media Many portions of Water Music have become familiar in popular culture. From 1958 to 1988, this was featured as the theme music for the British Television Franchise Anglia Television a regional Television Franchise for the East of England by ITV. From 1977 to 1996, Walt Disney World featured movements from both installments of Water Music as the background music for the Electrical Water Pageant, a parade of sea creatures lit up with electric lights off the coast of the Magic Kingdom. From 1983 to 1997, a movement of the music (Bourr√©e) was used as the theme music to the PBS television show The Frugal Gourmet. A performance of Water Music plays a major role in the movie The Madness of King George, in which King George III exhibits very erratic and inappropriate behavior at a concert, yelling at the orchestra to play louder (and eventually taking the place of the harpsichordist, playing very badly), culminating in a physical altercation with the Prince of Wales, leading to the Prince of Wales asking to be named Regent. Recordings There are many recordings. The Music for the Royal Fireworks (1749), composed 32 years later for another outdoor performance (this time, for George II of Great Britain for the fireworks in London's Green Park, on 27 April 1749), has often been paired with the Water Music on recordings. Hamilton Harty's re-orchestration was used in some earlier recordings of the Water Music. In 1956 the Australian conductor Charles Mackerras recorded this version, but he later changed his approach to Handel turning to the composer's original orchestration (his 1959 recording of the Music for the Royal Fireworks being seen as something of a watershed). Recent recordings are generally influenced by historically informed performance. There is a chamber version of the score known as the Oxford Water Music. The title comes from the location of the manuscript rather than the assumed place of performance: the arrangement was possibly intended by Handel for performance at Cannons by the band of his patron the Duke of Chandos. It has been recorded on the Avie label.

In more concise terms, this says that the structure group of the frame bundle of E, which is the real general linear group GLn(R), can be reduced to the subgroup consisting of those with positive determinant. If E is a real vector bundle of rank n, then a choice of metric on E amounts to a reduction of the structure group to the orthogonal group O(n). In that situation, an orientation of E amounts to a reduction from O(n) to the special orthogonal group SO(n). A vector bundle together with an orientation is called an oriented bundle. A vector bundle that can be given an orientation is called an orientable vector bundle. The basic invariant of an oriented bundle is the Euler class. The multiplication (that is, cup product) by the Euler class of an oriented bundle gives rise to a Gysin sequence.  Examples  A complex vector bundle is oriented in a canonical way. The notion of an orientation of a vector bundle generalizes an orientation of a differentiable manifold: an orientation of a differentiable manifold is an orientation of its tangent bundle. In particular, a differentiable manifold is orientable if and only if its tangent bundle is orientable as a vector bundle. (note: as a manifold, a tangent bundle is always orientable.)  Operations  To give an orientation to a real vector bundle E of rank n is to give an orientation to the (real) determinant bundle \\\\operatorname{det} E = \\\\wedge^n E of E. Similarly, to give an orientation to E is to give an orientation to the unit sphere bundle of E. Just as a real vector bundle is classified by the real infinite Grassmannian, oriented bundles are classified by the infinite Grassmannian of oriented real vector spaces.  Thom space  From the cohomological point of view, for any ring Œõ, a Œõ-orientation of a real vector bundle E of rank n means a choice (and existence) of a class :u \\\\in H^n(T(E); \\\\Lambda) in the cohomology ring of the Thom space T(E) such that u generates \\\\tilde{H}^*(T(E); \\\\Lambda) as a free H^*(E; \\\\Lambda)-module globally and locally: i.e., :H^*(E; \\\\Lambda) \\\\to \\\\tilde{H}^*(T(E); \\\\Lambda), x \\\\mapsto x \\\\smile u is an isomorphism (called the Thom isomorphism), where \\"tilde\\" means reduced cohomology, that restricts to each isomorphism :H^*(\\\\pi^{-1}(U); \\\\Lambda) \\\\to \\\\tilde{H}^*(T(E|_U); \\\\Lambda) induced by the trivialization \\\\pi^{-1}(U) \\\\simeq U \\\\times \\\\mathbf{R}^n. One can show, with some work, that the usual notion of an orientation coincides with a Z-orientation.

He is also known as Jorgji Bubani, or Brumbulli (the beetle) which was his pen-name for his satiric articles. Bubani was born in Boboshtic√´, a village near Kor√ß√´, today's Albania. He attended the French Lycee in Kor√ß√´, and then went to Athens where he attended the Industrial College. Bubani studied there chemistry. After the studies he moved to Romania, where at the time there was a large and active Albanian community (see: Albanians in Romania). His publicistics started in 1919, with some articles for the newspaper Kuvendi (Convent) in Italy. In Romania, Bubani worked for the Albanian newspaper Shqiperi' e Re (New Albania) from 1920 to 1922 (started initially in Bucharest and from July 1920 moved to Costanza by Albanian activist Ilo Mitk√´ Qaf√´zezi). After that, Bubani published his own journals: Dodona (named after the ancient oracle) in January 1922, the short-lived Z√´ri Shqip√´tar (The Albanian Voice) in March 1926, and Kosova (Kosovo), with a nationalistic orientation, with 33 issues from 1932 to 1933 in Albanian, Romanian, and French. His first satirical work appeared in the Dodona newspaper. He also worked as a secretary in the Albanian consulate in Costanza, and later in Sofia. Bubani was also a translator from Russian and Romanian. A great contribute consists of the translation of works from Victor Eftimiu, Romanian dramaturg originating from the same village (Boboshtic√´) as Bubani. Zoi Xoxe, an Albanian publicist and pro-monarchist, invited Bubani to move back to Albania in 1936. Bubani moved his family to Tirana and started as chief-editor of Drita (The light). He would later become the Director of Radio Tirana which started to broadcast on 28 November 1938. During 1943 (Italian invasion) he was member of the Italo-Albanian literary society. During the German occupation, he worked for the Ministry of Culture. Bubani was abducted by the Communists from his home in Fortuzi Street in Tirana on November 13, 1944, thus few days after Tirana's liberation by the partisans of National Liberation Front. He was accused of being a collaborator with the Italian and German occupators. He would remain in prison until 27 January 1945, when he was brought into the Special Court () together with many other well-known former politicians, military figures, Balli Kombetar leaders, publicists, clerics, etc., including Fejzi Alizoti, Kostaq Kotta, Terenzio Tocci, Gustav von Myrdacz, Ibrahim Bi√ßak√ßiu, Mihal Zallari, Javer Hurshiti, Beqir Valteri, Zef Kadarja, Kol√´ Tromara, Bahri Omari, etc. Ko√ßi Xoxe was leading the court sessions, while Bedri Spahiu was the prosecutor. Though the three witnesses testified that Bubani was an early sympathizer of the Liberation Movement, he was sentenced to 15 years. He was sent to forced work in the draining projects near Maliq.

Plot  A fanatically religious homeless man (\\"Cross Bearer\\") rants about sinners, and after donning a makeshift mask made of cloths, uses a hammer to kill a drug addict. Elsewhere, Heather, a lesbian stripper, is shown living with her girlfriend Victoria, a controlling and drug-addicted single mother, who she is cheating on with a co-worker named Bunny. Dreaming of running away to Greece together, Heather and Bunny agree to do a drug run for their abusive boss, intent on stealing the money they get for the delivery. Anton, the pimp who ordered the cocaine, lives on the top floor of an abandoned nightclub, which he brings two prostitutes to. Cross Bearer follows the three up to Anton's room, murders them with his hammer, and takes Anton's gun. Heather, Bunny, Victoria, another stripper named Cindy, and Cindy's boyfriend Mark, an amateur filmmaker and pornographer, arrive and are let in by Cross Bearer. The quintet finds Anton's remains, and are confronted by Cross Bearer, who shoots and beats Mark, and suffocates Cindy to death with a bag of cocaine. Victoria goes to look for a way out on her own, and is chased to a dead end, where Cross Bearer bludgeons her, and rips her tongue out. Heather and Bunny become separated, and the latter is murdered. Cross Bearer goes after Heather but is distracted by Mark, who shoots him with Anton's gun. After dealing with Mark, Cross Bearer pursues Heather, and the two fight, with Heather emerging victorious, pulling off Cross Bearer's mask, and pummeling him with a baseball bat. While looking for an exit, Heather finds the dying Mark, who gives her Anton's hidden stash of money. In the morning, Heather goes to her workplace, gives a nihilistic speech, and shoots both her boss and a man who had heckled her the previous day.

Such is the case for Cross Bearer, a seedy little indie horror flick that may have several shortcomings, but all which can be overlooked by the fact that you can feel the appreciation of the horror and grindhouse genres the film so skillfully captures\\". A 4/5 was awarded by Matt Boiselle of Dread Central, who praised the film's gore and killer, and wrote, \\"Ahlbrandt delivers on all fronts when it comes to not only delivering a storyline that hooks the audience, but providing a varied assortment of characters that we cannot wait to watch act out their most destructive vices\\". Horror News also responded well to the film, opining that, \\"Cross Bearer has a lot of violence, sex, and nudity but still done under the microscope of a professional operation that knows how to make use of their budgets\\" and \\"At the end of the day, Cross Bearer is a dirty little film that is well shot and well presented. It looks good and keeps the action moving treating us to quite a few stripper moments to keep things lively\\". Patrick Dolan of Rue Morgue gave the film a positive review, only criticizing the acting and \\"scatterbrained\\" structure. In a review for Film Threat, Mike Watt stated, \\"I wasn't in that much of a hurry to see yet another low-budget slasher film, but Cross Bearer contains enough pitch-black moments that it rises above the majority of the mediocre movies sharing the subgenre that we've all endured over the years. Apart from a few padded sections of gleeful debauchery, Cross Bearer's tone is very bleak and the performances very realistic\\".

The party came into existence as a result of intense dispute, especially within the Australian Labor Party, about the handling of the response to the Great Depression in Australia. In June 1931, a meeting of state premiers agreed on the Premiers' Plan, which involved sweeping austerity measures combined with increases in revenue. When the Premiers' Plan came up for a vote in South Australia, 23 of Labor's 30 House of Assembly members and two of Labor's four Legislative Council members voted for it. In August 1931, the South Australian state conference of the Labor Party expelled all of the MPs who supported the Premiers' Plan, including Premier Lionel Hill and his entire Cabinet. Expelled MPs (23) in the House of Assembly: *Frederick Birrell *Alfred Blackwell *Thomas Butterfield *Clement Collins *George Cooke *Jack Critchley *Bill Denny *Thomas Edwards *Even George *William Harvey *Lionel Hill *Leonard Hopkins *Robert Hunter *Beasley Kearney *Arthur McArthur *Sydney McHugh *John McInnes *John Pedler *Robert Richards *Eric Shepherd *Frank Staniford *Albert Thompson *Walter Warne Expelled MPs (2) in the Legislative Council: *James Jelley *Stanley Whitford Upon the failure of a November appeal to the federal executive of the Labor Party, the expelled MPs definitively constituted themselves as a separate parliamentary party. Having soundly lost its majority, the PLP ministry stayed in office until the 1933 election with the support of the conservative opposition‚Äîthe Liberal Federation to 1932 and the Liberal and Country League afterward. Hill, facing increasing political challenges, had himself appointed Agent-General in London and abruptly quit politics in February 1932. Robert Richards briefly succeeded him as Premier, and led the party into the 1933 election. The party, along with the official Labor Party and the rival splinter Lang Labor Party, performed poorly at the 1933 election. Of the 23 MPs the party had going into the election, only five ‚Äì Blackwell, McInnes, Pedler, and Richards in the House of Assembly, and Whitford in the Legislative Council, were reelected. The three Labor factions won only 13 seats between them, against 29 for the LCL. Two of the three Lang Labor Party MHAs elected at the 1933 state election, Bob Dale and Tom Howard, left the party in 1933 post-election after falling out with leader Doug Bardolph and formed their own party, the South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP). The four Labor parties merged back into the official Labor Party in June 1934 under the leadership of Andrew Lacey of the official Labor faction, following a successful unity conference. Whitford, the party's sole upper house member, had left the party to sit as an independent by the time of the conference, and was not re-admitted.

On the Tongue River, Indian scouts found a trail heading west to Rosebud Creek, and Miles followed with his command of 471 officers and enlisted men.  Battle  Spotting a camp of 61 lodges on Little Muddy Creek, Colonel Miles left his infantry and moved in with cavalry under Captain Edward Ball and mounted infantry under Lieutenant Edward W. Casey. The mounted force reached Lame Deer's sleeping village before dawn at 4:30 a.m. Company H of the 2nd Cavalry under Lieutenant Lovell H. Jerome and the mounted infantry under Casey began the fight with a mounted charge into the village. One of the army's Indian scouts, Hump, called to the Lakota and Cheyenne that Miles wanted to negotiate with them. Lame Deer approached Miles accompanied by his nephew Iron Star and two others. Miles told Lame Deer to lay down his rifle, which he did, but cocked and facing forward. When White Bull, one of Miles's scouts, tried to take Iron Star's rifle, he fired, with the bullet going through White Bull's coat. Lame Deer grabbed his weapon on the ground and fired it at Miles, the bullet just missing him and killing his orderly, Private Charles Shrenger. Chaos ensued. Several soldiers and Lakota were hit in the gunfire. Lame Deer was shot down by a volley of 17 bullets fired by men of Company L, 2nd Cavalry. Companies F, G, and L of the 2nd Cavalry then attacked the small and defenseless Indian village, destroying it and capturing about 450 horses, killing half of them.  Aftermath  The army had four men killed and ten wounded in the engagement, while the Lakota suffered from 5‚Äì14 killed, and about 20 wounded and 40 captured. Five Congressional Medals of Honor were awarded to soldiers for their actions during the battle: # Henry Wilkens ‚Äì first sergeant, Company L, 2nd Cavalry # William H. Jones ‚Äì sergeant, Company L, 2nd Cavalry # Harry Garland ‚Äì corporal, Company L, 2nd Cavalry # William Leonard ‚Äì private, Company L, 2nd Cavalry # Samuel D.

It was built from 1852 to 1860s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. It is now a historic house museum operated by the National Trust of Queensland.  History  Wolston House comprises the homestead and garden from the Wolston Estate, a large pastoral property originally established by Dr Stephen Simpson in 1852 and extended during the 1860s by Matthew Goggs. Stephen Simpson Stephen Simpson was appointed Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Moreton Bay District in 1842 when the area was first opened up for free settlement following the closure of the penal colony. He was a cultured man, a doctor of medicine, a Justice of the Peace, a Police Magistrate and a founding Member of the Queensland Legislative Council following Separation from New South Wales. His first home in the colony was at Woogaroo (now known as Goodna), situated between Brisbane and Ipswich on what was to become the site of the Wolston Park Hospital. In 1851, when the opportunity to buy land in the area arose, he purchased to the east of his first house on land overlooking the Brisbane River. The new property, which included stockyard, stables, outbuildings and a house and garden, was laid out by surveyor William Pettigrew in 1852. The garden was planned with care. Pettigrew recorded planting fruit trees there in his diary and Simpson was known for his interest in plants and gardening. It is possible that the fig trees at Wolston were planted by Simpson. The house that Simpson lived in was much smaller than the Wolston homestead that now exists. He had arrived in Brisbane as a recent widower and lived simply, so that a large or formal dwelling would have been unnecessary to him. He constructed a two-room brick cottage over a sandstone basement. The house was shingled and had a detached kitchen. This cottage now forms the core of the house. The existing sandstone kitchen which adjoins this section may have been added by Simpson before he sold the house in 1860 or it may have been added by Goggs. After his wife and child died, Simpson had designated his nephew, John Ommaney (for whom Mount Ommaney is named) as his heir. On 11 March 1856 the young man, aged 20, was riding from Wolston station and was thrown from his horse. The horse returned to Wolson and a search was undertaken. Ommaney was found on the ground insensible and, despite medical attention, died. His body was taken by steamer to be buried in the Church of England cemetery at Paddington.Queensland Index of Deaths, 1856/B9 John Ommanney This may have affected Simpson's commitment to remaining in the colony and a few years later, he put the Wolston estate up for sale and returned to England. According to the auction notice which appeared in the Moreton Bay Courier of 3 January 1860 the estate was by then well established with of fenced land, an extensive garden and orchards and 250 head of horses and 400 of cattle. Wolston was purchased by Matthew Buscall Goggs in October 1860. He continued to operate the estate as a cattle and horse breeding station and extended the holding to . Goggs, who was a farmer's son, had emigrated to Australia in 1841 and took up land at Chinchilla with his first wife. He purchased Wolston following his second marriage to Anne Gedge and they had a family of ten children. Goggs built a sandstone extension to the house in the 1860s to accommodate the needs of his family and in the 1870s a cedar annexe was added containing children's bedrooms. Goggs died in 1882 and was buried in a mausoleum which he had had built in the grounds of the estate. This was damaged in the 1893 floods and the bodies of Goggs and two infants were reburied at Toowong Cemetery. Following Gogg's death, his eldest son, also named Matthew Buscall, ran the estate until around 1890 when he moved to Brisbane. A Mr Thomas Matthews is recorded in Post Office Directories as having lived at Wolston between 1890 and 1893 and may have leased the property from the Goggs family. Over the years the family had bought and sold land and by 1907 the Wolston property had been reduced to of land around Wolston House. Wolston House, 1890In 1907 the Grindle family purchased the property. They built it up and operated a successful dairy, milking 120 cows a day and selling the milk to Brisbane. They covered the shingle roof with corrugated iron and rationalised the spacing of the verandah posts which had previously been irregularly spaced, reflecting the stages in which the house was extended. In 1956 the estate was purchased by Robert Hurley. By this time the property had become run down and the house was inhabited by three elderly Grindle brothers who were no longer able to run the property. At the time this consisted of of freehold land in poor condition. The Hurleys built up the property again establishing an intensive dairying business. In 1960 the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock resumed the property to establish a tick research centre. They demolished the farm outbuildings and intended to demolish the homestead also, however this was saved following an intensive campaign by the Queensland Women's Historical Association, the Royal Historical Society of Queensland and the newly formed National Trust of Queensland. In 1965, the house was transferred to the National Trust and became their first property. Sir Raphael Cilento, who was to become the second president of the Trust between 1966 and 1971, and the architect Karl Langer, were prominent in the acquisition of the homestead and in its interpretation. This interpretation rested on the occupation of the property by Dr Stephen Simpson and so it was decided to demolish the timber section at the rear, which was clearly of a later period. When acquired by the Trust, the house was in poor condition. Along with urgent repairs, extensive reconstruction was also carried out. While reflecting the philosophies of the early 1960s, this approach is not acceptable today. Current conservation philosophy, in line with the recommendations of the Burra Charter, favours minimal intervention and interpretation embraces the whole life of the house and its setting. Wolston House has now been owned by the Trust for over thirty years, and is still open to the public as a museum, so that the effects of changes in conservation philosophies and methods over this period can be studied.  Description  Wolston House is on a rural site between Brisbane and Ipswich overlooking the Brisbane River. The surrounding land is now occupied by Wacol Correctional Centre and the Department of Primary Industries and retains its pastoral aspect. The house is surrounded by a mature garden containing large trees, a well and a pump. The house is constructed of sandstone and brick with a galvanised iron roof and has six rooms. Two cellars with attached lean-tos form a half basement accessed from the rear. The house is one room deep with the rooms disposed along a verandah supported by timber posts. The rooms are accessed by French windows without a formal entrance. These consist of a large double room divided by folding cedar doors, a bedroom, dining room and a kitchen which is set at a slightly lower level. Much of the joinery is original, however, much of the plaster wall finishes have been reconstructed and the ceilings, which were thought to have been pressed metal and plaster, have been rebuilt in second hand timber. To the rear of the house, brick basement walls remain from the 1860s children's wing which was demolished in the 1970s. Wolston functions as a house museum and a modern caretaker's residence is situated to one side of the house. There is a modern toilet block behind the house and a timber railway building has been moved to the rear of the site as a store. The gate posts and part of the wall shown in 1930s photographs survives as do elements of original paving. The collection, which has been developed to furnish the house, does not relate to it but contains some items associated with people who lived or worked on the property. It contains some significant early furniture and objects.  Heritage listing  Wolston House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is also associated with the formation of the National Trust of Queensland and with Sir Raphael Cilento and Karl Langer, who played major roles in the acquisition of Wolston House as the Trust's foundation property. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Wolston House is a rare surviving early homestead, mainly constructed in the 1860s but incorporating an 1852 cottage. The materials and workmanship which survive from these stages of building illustrate techniques not commonly found in small rural buildings of this period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. By its form and the lack of a formal entry, the building demonstrates something of the way of life of the first European settlers of the district. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The nature of the building and its relationship with the landscape has considerable aesthetic appeal which is well liked by the community. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The earliest part of the house is associated with Dr Stephen Simpson (1792-1869), a man prominent in public life during the first years of Brisbane. It is also associated with the formation of the National Trust of Queensland and with Sir Raphael Cilento and Karl Langer, who played major roles in the acquisition of Wolston House as the Trust's foundation property.

South Poblacion, Masinloc, Zambales, Philippines. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Andrew the Apostle, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Iba. The church structure, a standout among Spanish-era churches in the Central Luzon region for having been built with coral stone instead of adobe stone, was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines along with 25 other Spanish-era churches in 2001. Parish History The parish of Masinloc had its beginnings as a mission founded by the Augustinian Recollects in 1607. It was founded by Father Andres de Espiritu with the guidance of Father Rodrigo de San Miguel, then vicar of the mission in Mariveles, Bataan, who urged the head of the religious group to set up a mission in the present-day site location of the town which was then abundant with plants locally referred to as hinloc. The original commune established by the Spanish friars is now barrios Bani and Tugui. Throughout the Spanish occupation of the Philippines, the parish of Masinloc was administered by the Augustinian Recollects and the Dominicans. In the 1980s, the parish was also administered by the Columban Fathers. Architecture Architectural History The exact date of construction of the present coral stone church cannot be traced, although some records tell that a certain Father Francisco de San Guillermo requested the construction of a church and convent in 1616 using materials that were also used in the construction of a fortification. By the mid-18th century, major earthquakes brought damage to the church structure, leaving it unused for a couple of decades. In 1825, during the administration of Father Gregorio Miguel Jim√©nez, the church and convent were rehabilitated. By 1836, repair works done by Father Jim√©nez were continued by Father Jos√© Aranguren; (later on, Father Aranguren would be installed as the Archbishop of Manila in 1846). From 1875 to 1877, major repairs on the church roof were executed. Father Juan Ort√≠z commissioned Architect Felipe Vera to replace the tile roof with nipa. Later on, Father Agust√≠n P√©rez had the thatched roof replaced with galvanized iron sheets. Father P√©rez also built the bell tower in 1882 to 1883. A strong earthquake damaged the church during the administration of the Columban missionaries in 1970. A year after, Father Donald Dudea made major repairs to the damaged structure including the addition of the new belfry and several repairs on the fa√ßade. A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on December 12, 1999 damaged the church, particularly cracking a part of the fa√ßade. Restoration efforts were established soon after in time for the 400th jubilee of the parish. Architectural Description The fa√ßade of the church is predominantly an Earthquake Baroque style with Neo-classic features. The front is divided into the triangular pediment, two horizontal sections and three vertical ones with an extended left portion forming the bell tower. It features saints‚Äô niches on the first level, rectangular windows on the second, and an elaborately carved niche of the town‚Äôs patron saint and carving of geometric shapes and medallions on the pediment. Triglyphs decorate the architrave between the second level and the pediment, giving the church a classical appearance. The belfry is designed like a circular template surmounted with a lantern and a cross. Restoration and Declaration as a National Cultural Treasure National Cultural treasure marker The church was officially declared by the National Museum of the Philippines as a National Cultural Treasure on July 31, 2001. A church or structure can be declared a National Cultural Treasure if most of its features (both exterior and interior) from pre-1898 are still intact and if it showcases examples of local artistic style and technique. By 2003, various cultural and historical institutions in the Philippines like the National Commission on Culture and the Arts spearheaded the restoration of 26 churches declared as National Cultural Treasures.

It was built from 1859 to . It is also known as Lytton Redoubt, Reformatory, and Signal Hill. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 August 2000.  History  Lytton Hill - also known as Signal Hill, Reformatory Hill, or the Lytton Redoubt - is highly significant in Queensland history. Strategically positioned at the mouth of the Brisbane River, the hill has been used as a customs lookout, signal and telegraph station, observation post and redoubt commanding the Fort Lytton defence complex, and boys' reformatory. The history of the Lytton district is closely aligned to the establishment during the 1840s and 1850s of the Port of Moreton Bay at Brisbane Town, on the Brisbane River, rather than at Cleveland on the Bay. In 1857 the New South Wales colonial government began to investigate the suitability of establishing a customs station at the south head of the Brisbane River (present-day Lytton). In August 1857, surveyor James Warner completed a preliminary survey of a site for a village at the south head, which was approved in November 1858, and in December 1858 tenders were called for the construction of a Customs Station nearby on the river. In February 1859 Warner officially surveyed sections 1 to 13 of the village of Lytton, as well as sites for a customs landing place and a signal station (possibly Lytton Hill). Between 1860 and 1863 some Lytton township allotments were alienated, mostly by Brisbane speculators who anticipated the development of wharf facilities at Lytton. Few private buildings were erected there. The Crown and Anchor Hotel at Lytton held a license in 1865-66 - about the time a government wharf adjacent to the Customs Reserve was built in 1866 to tranship railway stores and plant. From 1878 until the Lytton Hotel served local farmers and the annual military presence. Following separation from New South Wales in December 1859, the Queensland Government maintained Lytton's role as the customs entry to the Port of Moreton Bay. In 1860-61 an electric telegraph line was constructed from Brisbane to the Lytton Customs Station - the first telegraph line in Queensland built specifically for internal administrative use, to communicate shipping intelligence and meteorological observations from Moreton Bay. The Lytton Telegraph Office opened on 1 June 1861, the third to open in Queensland after Brisbane and Ipswich on the inter-colonial line, which had commenced operation in April 1861. In 1864 the electric telegraph was extended from Lytton via Cleveland and undersea cable to Dunwich on Stradbroke Island and north to Cape Moreton on Moreton Island. It is possible that Lytton Hill was functioning as a signal station as early as 1859, semaphoring news of the movement of ships to and from Moreton Bay to the Customs Station below, and from 1861, to the Lytton Telegraph Office. From 1866, Signal Hill, as it became known, also proved a useful post from which to observe semaphore messages from the prison on St Helena Island, which was not connected by telegraph. Sir George Bowen, on completion of his term as Queensland Governor and departure from Moreton Bay on 4 January 1868, officially named and designated Lytton as Brisbane's port. The telegraph line at Lytton appears to have been extended from the Customs Reserve to Signal Hill in the early 1870s, when in 1873 tenders were called for the construction of an electric telegraph station and residence on the hill. This was a double- gabled timber building which combined office and residence, and a detached kitchen house at the rear, erected at a cost of . The style was the forerunner of the most common 19th century type of post and telegraph office, with decorative finishes to verandah fascias, and sun hoods. Only four of this type of post and telegraph office were constructed in Queensland - the others being at Blackall (1883‚Äì84), St George (1885) and Cunnamulla (1889). The former Lytton Telegraph Office is the only one of these four remaining, and is also one of the earliest surviving, purpose-designed, post and telegraph office buildings in Queensland - pre-dated only by the former Cardwell Post and Telegraph Office (1870), and contemporaneous with the Mount Perry (Tenningerring) and the first Ravenswood Post Office, both erected in 1873 and both substantially modified. From 29 April 1876, the Lytton Telegraph Office also functioned as a post office. In the 1880s, telegraph lines were extended from Lytton to the Pile Light (constructed 1883) in Moreton Bay and to Fort Lytton. The history of Lytton Hill from 1880 is closely associated with the establishment of a military facility in the locality. In 1876, in an unprecedented act of colonial cohesion, the principal Australian colonies commissioned military experts General William Francis Drummond Jervois and Colonel Peter Scratchley, both of the Royal Engineers, to advise on colonial defences. As a consequence of their reports, a system of east coast seaboard fortifications was adopted, including Jervois' 1877 recommendation that the Brisbane River be defended with the establishment of a fortification and redoubt at Lytton, commanding lines of submarine torpedoes across the shipping channel at this point. Jervois recommended that the redoubt (an independent fortlet commanding Fort Lytton) be established on Signal Hill, which he considered would be an excellent point whence to watch the movements of an enemy in Moreton Bay. In July 1878, Scratchley recommended that the occupants of the hulk Proserpine, a former gaol anchored in Moreton Bay which had been refitted as a boys' reformatory, be removed to buildings on Signal Hill as part of the defensible post to be established there. He considered that the Reformatory buildings would eventually form part of the hill defences, and that the boys could help with ground preparation and maintenance associated with the defence complex. Despite some political debate, the Queensland colonial government voted to proceed with Jervois' and Scratchley's recommendations for the defence of Brisbane. Plans for the defence complex at Lytton were prepared in the Queensland Colonial Architect's office, and approved by Jervois in February 1879. The redoubt on Signal Hill was to include a large, single-storeyed, hardwood-framed, Reformatory building with chamferboard walls and a shingled roof; kitchen wing; WCs; and a boundary fence enclosing . The Reformatory buildings on Signal Hill were erected in 1880-81, before work started on the redoubt, using day labour assisted by the Reformatory boys. Dormitory accommodation was provided for 120 boys, along with schoolroom, workshops, store-room, kitchen and other facilities. A large vegetable garden was established and a superintendent's cottage was erected to the south of the Reformatory building, beyond the fortification earthworks. This cottage has been identified as an 1864 timber building - possibly moved from the Customs Reserve to Signal Hill . The 1873 Post and Telegraph Office remained within the Reformatory stockade, and the complex was completed and occupied early in March 1881. At this period, Signal Hill became known as Reformatory Hill. Following the \\"Russian scare\\" of March 1885 (the mobilisation of British and Russian troops along the Russia-Afghanistan border), Colonel George Arthur French, Commandant of the newly created Queensland Defence Force, took the opportunity to complete the fortification of the redoubt on Reformatory Hill, without which Fort Lytton was vulnerable to attack from land. To this end the stockade fence on the south side was re- erected nearer the Reformatory, arrow-headed demi-bastions were formed at the northeast and southwest corners, a ditch was constructed around the fortifications, the trees in front of the redoubt were cleared, a telegraph line was installed from Signal Hill to Fort Lytton below, and ordnance were ordered. In much of this work, the Reformatory boys assisted. By 1887 the Redoubt had been completed, its armament had arrived (although never mounted in position), and French recommended that the Reformatory now be removed. Finally in 1899, just prior to Federation, tenders were called for the removal of the Reformatory buildings from Lytton and their re-erection, with additions, at Westbrook near Toowoomba. The Lytton Redoubt was used as a semi- permanent military camp from 1881 until the early 1930s, principally during the Queensland Defence Force's annual Easter Encampments, at which militia from all over Queensland gathered at Lytton to practice manoeuvres. When the Lytton Defence Reserve of () was finally gazetted late in 1887, it included Reformatory Hill, Fort Lytton, and possibly part of the Customs Reserve. By 1901 the Defence Reserve had been extended to () following the resumption (in two stages: 1891 and 1900) of Lytton township for defence purposes. In the early 1900s this land and all military structures at Lytton were transferred to the new Commonwealth Department of Defence, and the Post and Telegraph Office on Lytton Hill was transferred to the new Commonwealth Post Master General's Department. At this time the only other building identified on Lytton Hill was a military store, erected in 1898 at a cost of . This is thought to be the brick building extant at the north end of Lytton Hill, possibly replacing the building marked \\"store\\" on an 1886 plan of the Lytton Redoubt. The fortifications on Lytton Hill remained in use until at least the early 1900s, when Queensland troops camped and trained on the slopes of Lytton Hill for active service in the South African War (1899-1902). The preparations for war was the longest continual use of the Lytton defensive positions since they were constructed in the 1880s. Some improvements to Lytton Hill were made at this time, including the construction a 20-stall timber stables building in 1901-02, and in 1903 the erection of a tent store and barbed-wire entanglement around the Redoubt. Subsequently, the site deteriorated, prior to its re- occupation by the military during the First World War (1914‚Äì18). In 1917 a dermatological hospital for Australian Infantry Forces and huts for men and officers were erected at Lytton Hill. Between 1919 and 1931 the flats adjacent to the Lytton Quarantine Station (established 1913-15) were used as Brisbane's first airfield, and it has been suggested that Lytton Hill may have acted as an air traffic control observation station. This has yet to be substantiated. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45), Lytton Hill was occupied by military signallers and engineers. A number of concrete structures were erected on the hill in association with this use. In addition, the s brick store at the north end of the hill was remodelled as a signals building, and a timber wing added. After 1945 the Lytton defence facilities were virtually abandoned, but military authorities maintained Lytton Hill as a communications base into the 1950s. In 1954 a wireless station with radar facilities was erected on the hill for the use of the pilot service. It was staffed on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week. Lytton Hill remained part of the Lytton Defence Reserve until title to the reserve passed to Ampol Refineries in 1963. Subsequent construction of the oil refinery and holding tanks has removed most traces of the Second World War defence installation, which included an airfield, with the exception of the top of Lytton Hill and a Second World War anti-aircraft position with concrete bunkers and gun emplacements, in the refinery grounds adjacent to Fort Lytton. For some years the post and telegraph office on Lytton Hill was occupied as a residence by an employee of the Ampol Refinery. The Port of Brisbane Authority designated Lytton Hill as the control for the Port of Brisbane , erecting an observation tower there to monitor Brisbane River and Moreton Bay shipping. A section of Lytton Hill was ceded from Ampol to the Port Authority for this purpose, but in the late 1990s the tower was removed and the land reverted to refinery ownership (now Caltex, with which Ampol merged in the 1990s). A 1994 field survey conducted by Austral Archaeology identified 50 archaeological elements visible on the surface of Lytton Hill, and all located above the contour line. The bulk of these remain, but the former Post and Telegraph Office was vandalised in 1994, resulting in loss of interior casement windows, doors, light fittings and fireplace surrounds and grates.  Description  Lytton Hill is a small, low hill located about south and west of Crab Creek, near the mouth of the Brisbane River. It is situated east/southeast of Fort Lytton and commands views over the Fort and Moreton Bay. It is located on freehold property owned by Caltex Australia Ltd, toward the eastern side of the Lytton Oil Refinery, with large oil and gas holding tanks to the north and west. The eastern side of the hill has been heavily quarried for land fill, and currently presents a red escarpment. The north and west sides of the hill have been cut back somewhat and the slopes modified to reduce water run-off and erosion. The principal surviving historical elements in mid-2000 include: * The former southern access road to Lytton Hill, which skirts the western margin of the site before curving north-east. The surface is of crushed blue metal gravel for about fifty per cent of its length, then is sealed for the remainder (LH-003). Since 1994, the road has become overrun with grasses (mostly kept mown), and an erosion ditch has been cut along that part of the road which curves around the western side of the hill. It appears that during this process the cattle grid (019) across the road was removed. * A small concrete shed (LH-002) with a timber-framed, galvanised-iron gabled roof, of uncertain date, located in the southwest corner of the site near where the access road begins to curve around the hill, and marked \\"9\\" near the entrance door. The raised concrete platform inside the building, and a small concrete unroofed extension on the southern side, suggest this may have been used as a generator shed. It may have been associated with Second World War defences, but possibly is of earlier date. * Part of the southwest demi-bastion (LH-005), a raised earthwork which formed the southwest section of the redoubt, completed in 1885. The remainder of the redoubt has been either demolished or eroded following fill being removed from the hillside. * A timber fence (LH-004) possibly dating to the Second World War, on the western side of Lytton Hill around the former southwest demi- bastion. As the site was heavily overgrown with lantana and grasses when inspected in July 2000, it is not clear how much of the fence survives. In 1994 the fence consisted of sawn timber uprights (average height ) spaced apart, drilled through to accommodate barbed wire strands apart. The uprights were sawn diagonally at the top with a bolt-fixed angled crosspiece to accommodate a further three strands of barbed wire, as in a security fence. * The site of the former Reformatory Superintendent's compound (LH-006) - a flat area on the east side of Lytton Hill, south of the Reformatory compound and Redoubt, with possible garden remnants such as freesias and guava trees. * A lineal planting (LH-012) approximately in length and wide, dominated by two mature fig trees and an understorey of lantana and other fig spp. This is located just south of the former Post and Telegraph Office. * An alignment of Pinus radiata trees (LH-018) following the access road which curves around the northern end of the site. A 1972 aerial photograph shows these trees once lined both sides of the road, forming an avenue approach to the former signals building - by 1994, all but one of the pines on the outside edge of the road had been removed. * The former Lytton Post and Telegraph Office (1873) (LH-024), a weatherboard building on timber stumps (with some replacement concrete piers). It has a hipped roof with gabled transepts at each end. The roof is clad with corrugated iron, covering the original shingles, and there are two brick chimneys, which have sandstone bases. The front (north) has a small central verandah, which has been enclosed. The original kitchen house is extant, and has a skillion-roofed extension of later date. There is a timber- framed external bathroom shed clad with corrugated iron. The interior of the main building has been modified with the removal of one wall. The interior is lined with horizontally-jointed tongue and groove timber boards, much of which is wide, centrally beaded. * A rectangular concrete structure (LH-023) adjacent to the former Telegraph Office, probably associated with the Second World War facility established on Lytton Hill. The long axis is aligned east- west and the entrance is via a sliding timber door on the southern side. The structure has a flat concrete roof surmounted by a square concrete footing which supports an inset timber frame covered with corrugated iron. This appears to have functioned as a recess and mounting for an internal structure or machinery no longer present. Internally, the structure comprises two rooms, the east room being larger than the west room. * A former butcher's shop/meat store (LH-027) - a timber framed structure clad in fibrous cement and corrugated iron, with fly-wire windows on the south, west and north sides, and a corrugated iron roof. Internally, the building has a small servery at the western end, behind which is the butcher's shop, with two overhead pipes for hanging carcasses. Beyond this is a timber cool room with sheet metal floor covering and sheet metal around the cool room door. The latter is a wooden unit on runners with a guiding overhead rail. There is an access chute to an adjacent holding pen. * A holding pen (LH-028) associated with the former butcher's shop/meat store, measuring long by wide, with a perimeter fence of steel posts with wire mesh. A plywood chute on the west side provides access to the butcher shop/meat store. * A former signals building (LH-031), comprising a brick (English bond) building aligned east-west at the northern end of the site, with a substantial northern annex of vertically-jointed tongue-and-groove timber boards (1940s). The brick building rests on a concrete foundation, has a corrugated iron roof, early 6-paned double-hung sash windows in the western and northern elevations, and a doorway in the eastern wall. Internally, the brick section has two rows of cone-shaped porcelain insulators attached to the ceiling, and remnant material used to insulate high tension electric wiring or antennae entering the building. A timber floor has been constructed above an earlier concrete floor, and a network of underfloor channels, possibly once housing for cables, is visible between the two floors. In the southwest corner of the room is a heavy duty switch board, and a large power board is located in the middle of the western wall, in front of a window. There are tiles, possibly of rubber, on the floor. A large opening in the north wall of the brick building leads, via a timber- framed enclosed walkway, to the Second World War timber extension, which is high-set on reinforced concrete piers and has a corrugated fibrous-cement roof. It is accessed externally from the northern end, via a small flight of timber steps. The fibrous-cement ceiling of this extension has been removed. Later structures on the site include a sheet and corrugated iron lined garage shed on a concrete slab, located to the southwest of the former telegraph office (010); and SEQEB substation SG1061 - a brick generator shed set on a concrete slab, with a corrugated iron roof and roller door entry (021). A pile of broken concrete to the southwest of the signals building suggests that some \\"tidying\\" of the site has occurred since 1994. A number of elements identified in the 1994 report may or may not survive, including: a large rectangular concrete slab with part of a stone wall base along the north side, adjacent to the brick section of the former signals building, and known to have been extant by 1890 (LH-043); a concrete pier (001); iron posts (009, 022); a concrete footing (011); an iron water pipe (013) near the service wing of the former telegraph office; a small earthwork (016); collapsed timber and wire fencing (017, 033); concrete slabs (007, 025, 026, 029, 035, 037, 038, 039, 040, 041, 045, 050); a concrete pathway (030); a concrete pit (032); a concrete culvert (034); a small timber-framed lean-to with corrugated asbestos cladding to three sides and a corrugated iron roof, damaged by fire (036); a north-south aligned bridge with east-west aligned culvert headwalls spanning a former drainage channel (042); a Y-shaped path and junction to the south and east of the butcher's shop/meat store (044); a small rectangular concrete housing for metal taps (046); a concrete drain (047); a cast iron grate (moveable relic - 048); and fragments of earthenware piping near the quarry on the east side of the hill (049). In July 2000 there appeared to be little evidence of the collapsed galvanised iron tank and stand (LH-014) to the southwest of the former Post and Telegraph Office, identified in the 1994 survey; nor of a flagpole (LH-020) comprising a galvanised iron upright with pulley, located northeast of the former cattle grid across the access road on the western side of the hill, and likely associated with a Second World War facility. Two corrugated galvanised iron tanks on concrete slabs (LH-015), aligned east-west, west of the tank stand, have collapsed and have been crushed and left as a pile of rusting iron. The site has numerous plantings associated with occupation of the hill since at least 1873. A mature Ficus macrophylla (Moreton Bay Fig) to the northeast of the former Post and Telegraph Office may pre-date non-indigenous occupation.  Heritage listing  Lytton Hill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 August 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Lytton Hill is important in illustrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being: \\\\- a significant communication and observation post at the mouth of the Brisbane River from , illustrating the dependence of the Australian colonies on maritime trade and communications in the 19th century; \\\\- associated with the early and rapid adoption of the electric telegraph in Queensland in the 1860s/1870s; \\\\- a strategic and integral component of the 1880s military facility established at Lytton to defend the Brisbane River; \\\\- associated with the conduct of a Boys Reformatory on the Hill from 1880 to 1899; \\\\- associated with the activities of the Queensland militia from the early 1880s to the early 1930s and with Queensland preparation for participation in the South African War; \\\\- the site of a military hospital during the First World War; \\\\- the site of a strategic signals station during the Second World War; \\\\- the site of the Control Tower for the Port of Brisbane in the late 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The site has rarity value, not least for its layering of strategic communication, observation and defence roles for over 130 years. The 1873 former Telegraph Office is the only known surviving example of its age and type in Queensland, and is one of the earliest surviving purpose-designed post and telegraph offices in the State. The surviving section of the Redoubt is a rare example of a defence fortification built in Queensland in the 1880s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. As an archaeological site, the hill has the potential to reveal traces of occupation from Separation until the present. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The 1873 former Telegraph Office is the only known surviving example of its age and type in Queensland, and is one of the earliest surviving purpose-designed post and telegraph offices in the State. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value for its sense of dramatic isolation and ruin within the surrounding well-ordered oil refinery, and for the panoramic views both from and to the hill. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site is significant socially for its association with the development of military culture in Queensland from the 1880s to the 1930s; and as the site of the Reformatory where boys were educated and trained in Queensland in the last two decades of the 19th century.

He is an expert in traditional Malay and South- East Asian theatre as well as one of the leading writers of Malaysian English Literature.www.gsyousof.comUM Expert , The Curriculum Vitae of Dato' Prof. Dr. Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof. Early years and education Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof, (born on 21 November 1939) is the eldest of five children of Punjabi Muslim parents. He completed his primary and secondary education at King Edward VII School in the beautiful lake-town of Taiping, before proceeding to the newly established campus of the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, where he majored in English, with a minor in Islamic Studies. Ghulam-Sarwar also studied Sanskrit and French, continuing his early interest in languages which included Urdu, Punjabi and Tamil. In later years he was to delve into Malay, Hokkien, Tagalog as well as Persian. Ghulam-Sarwar‚Äôs plans to study for a postgraduate degree at the University of Malaya did not materialise due to family considerations as well as his particular interest to work on Asian rather than western literature. He served as a temporary teacher at the Methodist Boys‚Äô School in Penang while also helping in his family textiles business and rubber estate. With the establishment in 1969 of University of Penang (later renamed Science University of Malaya, locally Universiti Sains Malaysia or USM), he was invited in the following year to set up the first performing arts programme in the country at that university. Given the opportunity to go for further studies in theatre under the university‚Äôs Academic Staff Training Scheme, Ghulam-Sarwar went to Honolulu in 1972 on a grant from the East-West Centre, entering directly into the PhD programme of the University of Hawaii Department of Drama and Theatre. Following research trips to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan, an extended tour of several European and Asian countries as well as fieldwork in the province of Kelantan in Malaysia, Ghulam-Sarwar visited Australia at the invitation of the South Australian government to look at theatre facilities in Adelaide, with a view to enhancing cultural exchange between the twin cities of Adelaide and Georgetown, Penang. He obtained his PhD in 1976 with a dissertation on the ancient mak yong dance theatre under the supervision of the renowned Asian theatre scholar, James R Brandon. Ghulam-Sarwar‚Äôs was to be the world‚Äôs first ever doctorate on any of the Malay performing arts. Involvement in theatre and literature Returning to USM in 1976, Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof served as Head of the Performing Arts programme and Associate Professor, until 1995. Following several years of freelance teaching as well as research, mainly in Southeast Asia, but also in India, he joined the Cultural Centre of the University of Malaya (UMCC) as Professor in theatre studies. In 2009 Ghulam- Sarwar joined the English Department of the International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM) in Kuala Lumpur as Senior Academic Fellow, while concurrently continuing to serve as Expert at the UMCC where he supervised postgraduate students in Theatre as well as Visual Arts. In July 2014, leaving IIUM, he returned to UMCC. Ghulam-Sarwar has served as visiting professor and guest lecturer at universities in Asia, Australia as well as Europe in addition to participating in numerous conferences involving diverse disciplines in Asian arts and culture. Although not actively involved as a theatre practitioner, Ghulam-Sarwar has, throughout the years, participated actively in various theatre and cultural programmes involving international troupes during the annual Festival of Penang, as well as on preservation and conservation of traditional heritage. Research Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof has carved for himself a niche as one the world‚Äôs leading researchers on traditional Southeast Asian theatre, as well as related subjects such as Asian epics, folk traditions of the arts and shamanic rituals through his unstinting forays into the field in almost all countries of the region. Apart from traditional Asian theatre, his major research interests include Asian literatures, folklore studies, as well as South- and Southeast Asian cultures, comparative religion, mythology and, Sufism. In ethnographic and folklore studies he has explored Malay-Indonesian mythology and folk literature, Malay concepts of the soul (semangat), and angin as well as their place in healing processes involving traditional theatre. It is through his pioneering research and sustained academic writing that Ghulam-Sarwar has made his greatest contributions to learning. For the first time ever, through his efforts courses in traditional Malay and Southeast Asian genres such as the shadow play (wayang kulit), the mak yong dance theatre and bangsawan were offered in any Malaysian university. In his teaching of traditional theatre he successfully involved puppeteers, actors, dancers as well as musicians. These practices as well as the curricula he first developed at USM were to serve as models for subsequent programmes in performing arts in several academic institutions Beyond his own country, his research efforts in Indonesia, the Philippines, mainland Southeast Asia, and India have provided new insights into relationships between particular shared genres such as the shadow play. His unstinting field research over several decades has generated a considerable amount of data, documentation and writing for which Ghulam-Sarwar has become justifiably well-known. Creative writing When it comes to creative writing Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof, who has worked with poetry, drama as well as short stories, has emerged as one of Malaysia‚Äôs most prolific and original authors in the English language. His poetry has been published in several journals in various countries. To date he has published three collections of verse: Performed Memories (1982), Songs for Shooting Stars: Mystical Verse (2011) and Transient Moments (2012). Other volumes are expected to see the light of day in the coming years. While a small number of Ghulam- Sarwar‚Äôs poems explore ordinary everyday life, most of his verse reflects a fascination with what he calls alternative realities, and his encounters with them. Influences from a whole range of western and eastern poets as well as mysticism, particularly Sufism are evident in his work. Critics have compared his nature mysticism to William Wordsworth‚Äôs: ‚Äúin spite of the huge boundaries of time and space, both Ghulam Sarwar‚Äôs contemporary poetry and Wordsworth‚Äôs poems from the Romantic era have a very similar and strong affinity with nature.‚ÄùAmatulhafeez Alvi, Ravichandran Vengadasamy, and Amrah Binti Abdul Majid, ‚ÄúThe Philosophy of Nature in the Poetry of Ghulam Sarwar Yousuf and William Wordsworth: A Comparative Ecocritical Analysis,‚Äù GEMA Online Journal of Language Studies 19(2019), 327‚Äì345 (343). Thus, in many ways, his verse is unique, differing considerably in content, style, meaning and intention from that of most Malaysian poets. Ghulam-Sarwar attributes these features in his verse to his personal background and his cultural heritage from both the Near East and South Asia, something that he has been keenly aware of and fascinated with from his teens. Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof has written three full-length plays: Halfway Road, Penang, The Trial of Hang Tuah the Great and Suvarna Padma: The Golden Lotus in addition to several shorter pieces. Each of his plays is controversial in its own way due to the issues explored. Among his twenty or so short stories several have been published. Notable ones include ‚ÄúLottery Ticket‚Äù, ‚ÄúTok Dalang‚Äù, ‚ÄúDewi Ratnasari‚Äù and ‚ÄúMeditations on a Charpoy‚Äù. Like his poetry, Ghulam-Sarwar‚Äôs short stories as well as his plays are embedded in traditional Asian culture, mythology as well as religious experience. His short fiction, in particular, explores little known facets of Malaysian life through such characters as the traditional shadow puppeteer (dalang) or members of minority communities such as Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs or Tamil Muslims within the complex and diverse fabric of Malaysian society. Translations Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof has worked on translations of poetry from Urdu into English, with special focus on the lyrical ghazal form, and well as selected examples of modern verse. In collaboration with others he has also worked on translations of Persian poetry into English. UNESCO project Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof prepared the official nomination papers on behalf of the Malaysian Ministry of Culture for submission to UNESCO to gain recognition for the mak yong dance theatre of Malaysia as an Item of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in the year 2005.

It is on the North Coast line serving the city of Maryborough. It was designed by Chief Engineer of the Queensland Railways Department and built from 1878 to 1890 by John Roddam & John Walker. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The station forecourt is served by Greyhound Australia coach services to Brisbane, Hervey Bay, Agnes Water and Cairns,Timetables Greyhound Australia and Premier Motor Services services to Brisbane and CairnsTimetables Premier Motor Service Queensland Rail operates services between Hervey Bay and Maryborough West railway station via Maryborough station. Maryborough railway station opened in 1878, when an eight kilometre branch into Maryborough was built as part of the North Coast line. It was built as a terminal station. Beyond the station, the line continued to service the Walkers Limited (now Downer Rail) railway workshops and Mary River wharf. An air raid shelter was built into the station during World War II for protection of the staff in case an air raid occurred.Maryborough Railway Station Tourism Queensland In 1924, a new station was built on the North Coast line at Baddow, that was used by through services. Terminating services continued to use Maryborough station. In 1989, a new seven kilometre alignment of the North Coast line was built as part of the electrification of the line. This included a new Maryborough West station, replacing both Maryborough and Baddow stations.Hansard Queensland Parliament 27 February 1986\\"The Maryborough Shunt\\" Railway Digest November 2013 pages 40-43 As at 2013, Maryborough railway station consists of one island platform and an extensive yard. Although the station and yard have been decommissioned, the branch line remains in use to service the Downer Rail workshops. The building fell into a state of disrepair, but was restored in the early 2000s. Queensland Rail maintains a presence on part of the station site in relation to rail freight and as a booking office, while other parts are being developed into a shopping centre.  History  The railway complex on Lennox Street in Maryborough consists of a number of timber buildings constructed between 1878 and the 1930s, as well as a brick and concrete platform and a concrete air raid shelter built in 1942. The Maryborough railway station was built as the terminus of a railway network that radiated from Maryborough, transporting timber, coal, sugar and other agricultural products to the wharves on the Mary River. Maryborough was also a busy rail terminal for passenger traffic. Although the Maryborough railway station is no longer used, the station buildings are a picturesque reminder of significant past economic activity and transport arrangements within the region. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a wool-store on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by Edgar Thomas Aldridge, and brothers Henry and Richard E. Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow. In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) in 1861. Items shipped from Maryborough included wool, tallow, and timber and these were later followed by coal and sugar. Maryborough grew quickly as the port for Gympie, where gold was discovered in October 1867, as it provided a route by ship to the Port of Maryborough, then overland south to Gympie, an alternative to the rough road running north from Brisbane. The long-term viability of the Gympie goldfield ensured the continued growth of Maryborough and the need for sawmills, foundries and construction firms. Coal mining on the Burrum River also needed Maryborough's construction industries and shipping. However, the Urangan Jetty in Hervey Bay, which opened in 1917, replaced Maryborough as the port for the coal mining and sugar industries. The closure of Walker's shipbuilding yards in 1974 spelled the end of Maryborough as a port. Maryborough railway station, ca. 1882 Maryborough's rise as a railway centre also resulted from the discovery of gold at Gympie. In August 1877 the Queensland Government approved three railways to connect mining towns to their principal ports: Townsville to Charters Towers; Bundaberg to Mount Perry; and Maryborough to Gympie. The railway to Gympie opened in August 1881, and in 1883 a branch line north to the coalfields at Burrum was started at Croydon Junction (Baddow), several kilometres northwest of Maryborough. When the line was extended north to Bundaberg in 1888 it followed this branch line, which meant that the North Coast line later bypassed Maryborough railway station and left it at the end of a dead-end spur. Maryborough railway station yard, 1882 Maryborough railway station became the centre of a busy network of branch lines. A short branch line was built through the Queen's Park Botanic Gardens to the wharf area in 1880, and in 1883 this was extended eastwards alongside the river north of Kent Street to the Walkers Limited foundry and shipyards. It was later extended to the Maryborough Sugar Factory (established 1894). A branch line connecting to Maryborough was also opened from Theebine, south of Tiaro, to Kilkivan in 1886, and was later extended to Murgon, Proston, Windera, Kingaroy, Tarong and Nanango (the latter by 1911). A branch line from Mungar, south of Maryborough, to Broweena opened in 1889, and this line eventually extended to Gayndah, Mundubbera and Monto (1929). Coal from the Burrum fields eventually required better port facilities and a branch line was built to Pialba in 1896, from Colton railway station (just north of Aldershot), between Maryborough and Burrum. This branch was extended to Urangan in 1913. Engine and carriage maintenance workshops were built and expanded in Maryborough from 1880. Henry Taylor (junior) won the contract for a machine shop in January 1880, and this was extended in 1881 and 1884. The workshops, which were located to the south-west of the station, became less important after the Maryborough system was linked to the rest of Queensland in 1891. They are no longer extant, having been demolished for a shopping centre in the late 1990s. After the line to Gympie was approved in 1877, drawings for buildings at the Maryborough station were prepared by the Engineering Branch of the Department of Railways. The site chosen for the Maryborough railway station was centrally located on a municipal park reserve. In 1878 construction at the site included a station master's residence, engineer's office (non-extant), store and blacksmith's workshop. A large programme of works in the years 1879 and 1880 saw the construction of a goods' shed, passenger station, closets and urinals, turntable, loading banks, station gates and fences and a semaphore signal. The timber station building was handsome, yet modest in scale. A foreman's cottage was constructed in 1881 and a locomotive shed was built in 1882. In 1884 a gatehouse was built at the Ferry Street entrance, and new offices for the traffic manager and engineers were built the same year. In 1885 and 1886 a coal depot and a forkline were built, and the turntable was taken up. A new locomotive shed was built in 1900.  1878 station master's residence (192 Lennox Street)  Drawings for the residence were approved by Chief Engineer Henry Charles Stanley on 16 April 1878. The builders were John Roddam and John Walker. In 1894 a verandah and an additional room were added on the south-west side. After 1896 alterations were made to the rear of the house, linking the formerly detached kitchen and service wing to the house. The building was later used as the district traffic manager's residence, then as the district superintendent's residence by 1935 until about 1975, before being used by Queensland Rail as quarters for staff. Conservation work was undertaken to this building in 2012.  Administration complex  Loco office from the north-west, 2007 In 1884 drawings were made for new offices to replace the original (1878) traffic manager and engineers office. In plan the new building was a rectangle containing four offices with verandahs to three sides. Additions were made to the south-west side later in 1884, and in 1911 a small rear addition was made for the traffic manager and Telegraph Office (later the pay office and ladies toilet). Soon after the wagon and traffic offices were added to the rear, and in 1920 the loco office, with four open verandahs, was relocated to its present position behind the wagon and traffic offices. By 1920, there were more offices at the northern end of the traffic manager and Engineer's Office, and it was linked to the wagon and traffic offices in 1920. The complex was used by Queensland Rail as office space until 2008.  12 ton weighbridge  This was extant by 1937.  Railway station building  Maryborough railway station building, 1994 Although the architect is unknown, drawings for the first stage of the station building were approved by Henry Charles Stanley on 24 October 1879, and the contract was awarded to Henry Taylor (junior) on 8 Jan 1880, for ¬£1325. A head station building and a short platform were built. On 24 December 1892 chief draughtsman Henrick Hansen approved alterations to the station and the main platform verandah, the demolition of the buildings extending to the north-west of the head station, and the enlargement of the lamp room. This contract was awarded to John Kyle on 24 January 1893, for ¬£1176. The Station Master's office was enlarged in 1912.  Guards' room and porters' store  The guards' room was built in 1917, and the porters' store existed by 1937 as an extension on the north-west end.  Goods shed  The design for the goods shed was approved by HC Stanley on 8 July 1879, and the contract was awarded to G and E Negus in September 1879, for ¬£698. The shed was , and included an office, warehouse crane, and docks. It had a raised timber floor and a single rail track running through the shed against the south-west wall. Four individual loading dock entrances penetrated the north-east wall, and a outside loading platform was located at the north end. An extension was approved by Stanley on 4 October 1881, and Charles Whiting won the contract for ¬£629. The extension to the south-west side of the goods shed was long, with two docks and a warehouse crane. In 1908 a new office was built at the south-east end of building, and this was later extended. The office had an open verandah by 1920.  Main platform  Platform and track, 2010 In 1880 the platform configuration included a covered verandah platform at the rear of the station building, plus a short uncovered platform extending to the north-west. In 1892 Hansen approved a platform verandah extension of seven bays by three bays wide, between the station building and a lamp room (which later became refreshment rooms), the carriage shed at the end of the platform was moved, and a fourth siding was built on the south-west side of the platform. Between 1893 and 1925 the island platform was extended several times to the north-west, to a total of 45 bays. In 1925 drawings for extending the main platform verandah included the last 24 bays of the current platform.  Former refreshment rooms  1990s refreshment kiosk The first (south-east) portion of the original refreshment room was built in the 1890s, and may have been a lamp room beforehand. It was doubled in size in 1909, and was closed in 1968. It has since been used for storage. A new refreshment booth was built to the south- east in the 1990s, under the main platform verandah.  Air raid shelter  One air raid shelter survives of two built in the early 1940s to the south- west of the station building. The North Coast railway line was extremely busy during World War II, and the construction of air raid shelters at Maryborough railway station was probably linked to this increased wartime traffic as well as to Maryborough's value as an industrial target and transport hub. Government regulations regarding the safety of the population also prompted the building of shelters. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Queensland Premier William Forgan Smith ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Another 24 local governments in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public. A large number of businesses also had to build air raid shelters. Owners of any building in the coastal areas where over 30 people would normally be present at any one time were required to build shelters either within the building, or adjacent to it. However, there was disagreement over who was responsible for building shelters at railway stations. At a conference in late February 1942 the Secretary for Health and Home Affairs, Ned Hanlon, stressed that if Queensland Railways did not act on building public air raid shelters it would make it harder for the Queensland Government to insist that other businesses and local authorities do so. It was recommended that the Department of Public Works proceed to construct shelters on or adjoining railway premises. On 2 March 1942 a memorandum from the Undersecretary of the Department of Public Works reported that Queensland Railways had already built shelters for its employees at some of the larger train stations, and it recommended that a further 28 full-size public surface shelters, three half-size shelters, and three sets of trenches, be built outside Brisbane, at a total cost of ¬£16,150. Most of the recommended surface shelters and trenches were on the North Coast railway line, at 19 stations from Nambour to Cairns. Queensland was apparently the only Australian state to build air raid shelters at its railway stations. The survival of the public air raid shelter at Maryborough railway station is fortuitous, given the rate of shelter demolition after the war. The only other railway air raid shelters to survive are the Landsborough Air Raid Shelter and the ones at Toowoomba railway station and Shorncliffe railway station.  1878 engineer's office  William Elliot and James Patterson signed a contract to build the Engineer's Office on 20 February 1878. In plan it was initially an rectangle, with four rooms and a verandah. Alterations and additions in 1884 were signed by HC Stanley. Thomas Ferguson and Thomas Holden were the contractors. The office was turned into the traffic manager's quarters with two extra rooms at the rear, a verandah around the whole building, and a covered way to new detached kitchen wing. The building was being used as the station master's residence by 1935. It was moved to the north-east in . Maryborough station remained busy until the 1980s. During 1962 there were 240 regular trains each week, including 147 passenger services. In 1965 Baddow on the main northern line had 331 regular services each week and 48 steam locomotives operated from the Maryborough Locomotive Depot at this time. The Sunlander did not stop at Maryborough however, and it dropped any passengers for Maryborough at Baddow where a taxi service (an engine and van) completed the journey. All passenger services from Baddow to Maryborough ceased on 20 April 1986, to be replaced by a minibus service, and in 1988 a main line upgrade by-passed Baddow. A new station was established at Maryborough West. In late 2007 Queensland Railways still had a freight train presence at the Maryborough station yards. In April 2010 the 1878 engineer's office was substantially damaged by fire and, after a no prudent and feasible argument was made, approval was given for its remains to be demolished. It stood at the southernmost end of the complex on Lennox Street and comprised two adjacent single-storey, timber-framed structures, the former office on Lennox Street and a kitchen building to the rear. Clad in weatherboards, both parts stood on concrete stumps with timber slats between them. The former office structure had a roof made up of a series of gablets, two terminating a gable running parallel to Lennox Street and two terminating twin gables facing the rear of the site. Each gablet had decorated bargeboards supported on timber brackets and single vents filled with timber louvres. The former kitchen building comprised a gable running parallel to Lennox Street with a broken-back skillion connecting to the office and separate skillion at the rear. Its stove recess was clad in corrugated metal sheeting and had a separate skillion roof. The land on which the Engineer's Office stood was removed from within the heritage boundary for this place in 2013.  Description  The Maryborough railway station complex of timber buildings runs for some distance along Lennox Street, contributing greatly to the streetscape. The main railway station building also acts as a focal end point to the vista along Ellena Street. Four railway lines approached the station (which is aligned south-west to north-east) from the north-west. The station buildings, working along Lennox Street from north-east to south-west, include:  1878 station master's residence  This is a single-storeyed timber residence with verandahs to the southern, eastern and northern sides. It is set on concrete stumps on gently sloping ground. The house is clad in painted weatherboards and features French doors with fanlights, which provide access from the rooms in the main residence to the verandahs, and a mixture of 6:6, 4:4 and 1:1 vertical sliding sash windows to the kitchen and later rear extensions. A concave iron window hood returning at each end protects the triple sash window with louvered shutters on the front projecting gable, which also features bargeboards with supporting brackets along the eaves and a finial at the apex. The building is asymmetrically arranged with a number of corrugated zincalume-clad gables of varying heights and skillion-roofed verandah awnings. The verandahs to the south and east are enclosed with lattice panels and the awnings are supported on chamfered timber posts with decorative capitals and brackets. The verandah to the north (former fernery) is enclosed with lattice and timber louvers. The rear extensions and original kitchen wing are also constructed with gabled roof forms interconnecting at varying heights. Many of the sash windows have sunshade awnings. A skillion- roofed garage at the rear of the kitchen is not of cultural heritage significance. The interior of the residence has been altered, but retains the original 4-room layout from the 1878 residence and the 2-room 1894 extension. The front door opens into a long hall, which leads off to rooms on either side and then to a large communal room. This front portion of the residence retains early French doors and window joinery, as well as a fireplace with decorative tiles and ironwork and timber mantelpiece in the front north-east bedroom (former lounge). This is the only fireplace in the house. The rear wing of the house has been altered to accommodate multiple bedrooms for railway staff. The internal walls are clad with sheet material over the original tongue and groove linings except in the kitchen and bathroom. The building is set in an established garden with mature trees.  Administration complex  Traffic manager and engineer's office, from the south-west, 2007 The traffic manager and engineer's office is timber-framed, low-set, and is clad in weatherboards. It has a gabled corrugated iron-clad roof. Most of the front verandah has been enclosed and the walls to the verandah have been removed. Internal partitions are tongue and groove-lined. The original open rear verandah links with the wagon and traffic offices, forming a covered way. The wagon and traffic offices are also low-set and timber-framed, and are clad with weatherboards. The gabled corrugated iron roof has a ridge lantern skylight which is closed off at ceiling level. The building is linked across two open verandahs with the traffic manager's and engineer's office to the south-east, and is also connected to the loco office to the north-west. The loco office is a low-set gabled timber building with a corrugated iron roof, set on concrete stumps and clad with chamferboards. Three of its verandahs are now enclosed and incorporated into the internal space. The open south-west verandah has stop- chamfered timber posts, simple strut brackets, and a timber handrail. The pay office is a weatherboard-clad timber structure with a gabled corrugated iron roof, connected by covered verandahs to the traffic manager and engineer's office and to the former loco office to the north. A small extension to the north-east corner accommodates a ladies toilet. Pay windows and barriers remain on the western side verandahs, and a concrete strong room extends out from the northern wall.  12 ton weighbridge  The weighbridge consists of a small timber skillion-roofed shelter with a scales mechanism inside, and a weighbridge steel plate surrounded by four timber bollards and concrete pads located to the south-west of the shelter.  Railway station building  The station is a single-storeyed, timber-framed building, set at ground level. It is clad in chamferboards and has a gabled corrugated iron roof. The rear roof extends over the original station platform and is supported at its outer edge by unusual tapered stop-chamfered timber posts with octagonal capitals and strut brackets. The main front entrance consists of a projecting gabled portico supported on pairs of timber posts and features a timber arch and gable infill. A central passageway leads through the station to the main platform behind the building. There are skillion-roofed front verandahs, partly enclosed on the south-west side, either side of the portico. These verandahs have stop-chamfered posts and timber strut brackets that match those of the station platform. There is an extension at the south-west end of the station with skillion-roofed structures and a bracketed hood over the front windows. A separate timber-framed ladies waiting room and toilets with a gabled roof adjoins the north-east end of the station building. This has a domestic-scaled post-supported awning linked to the rear station platform. There are new male toilets in the former cloak room. A World War I railways honour board is located at the rear of the station beside the ticket office.  Guards' room and porters' store  This is a gable-roofed timber building, clad in weatherboards, located to the north-west of the north- eastern end of the station building.  Goods shed  The goods shed is a timber-framed, corrugated iron-clad building with a gable roof. It has a weatherboard-clad, hipped roof office extension to the south-east. There is an elevated loading dock along the north-east elevation. Projecting rafters over the loading dock have decorative shaped ends and are strutted off the outer wall. The roof of the goods shed is supported on large timber queen post trusses. An internal platform and rail line runs the length of the shed against the south-west wall. The office wing has an open verandah on the north-east elevation. A modern steel canopy has been added to the northwest end of the goods shed, but this is not historically significant and has not been included within the heritage boundary.  Main platform  Maryborough railway station, platform from the north-west, 2007 The platform was constructed in stages. The first seven bays of the platform roof are three- bays wide, with exposed king-post trusses each with lower arched brackets, and side skillion extensions. These are supported on tapering chamfered timber posts with octagonal capitals and decorative strut brackets of similar design to that of the station. The roof is clad in corrugated iron. The next four and a half bays (two bays wide) are to the north-east of the original refreshment rooms and are an extension of the original design for the main station building. To the north-west of refreshment rooms is a new canopy erected to cover a steam locomotive. From the refreshment rooms, the platform is an island, servicing tracks on both sides. The first nine bays maintain the original bell-cast roof profile, while the final 24 bays are a higher, simple pitched roof with stop chamfered timber posts and angle strut brackets. The roof to this section is of corrugated iron with curved ridge sheets and terminates at the north-west end with a weatherboard-sheeted gable, signage and surmounted clock housing. The tracks either side of the platform within the heritage boundary should be retained to assist interpretation of the site. A recent coach terminal has been added to the south-west side of the platform between the station and the former refreshment rooms, and a new canopy has been added northwest of the refreshment rooms, to shelter a historic locomotive. Neither of these two recent structures is historically significant.  Former refreshment rooms  The original refreshment rooms building is a timber-framed building clad with chamferboards. The gabled roof is clad in corrugated iron. The building is connected to the main station building by the platform and platform awnings. Internally the building consists of a kitchen and dining room area.  Air raid shelter  The shelter is a concrete structure long, and wide. The flat concrete roof is thick, and the walls are thick. Doorways are located at each end of the north- east elevation, with each doorway being set in a recessed area that is stepped back from the end of the shelter, and from the front face of the shelter. A sign on the north-east elevation reads \\"Air Raid Shelter for Passengers Only\\". The shelter is used for storage, and electrical cables enter it above the double timber doors at the north-west end. There is a single timber door at the south-east end.  Grounds  There is a large fig tree (Ficus sp.) in front of the traffic manager and engineers office, and there are mature trees around the 1878 station master's residence.  Heritage listing  Maryborough railway station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Maryborough railway station (established in 1878) demonstrates the importance of Maryborough as a port for the export of the products of the interior. Although the Port of Maryborough declined after 1917, the railway station is a reminder of the past importance of the city to Queensland's export trade. The complex of timber railway buildings in central Maryborough, including a residence, the station building and main platform verandah, nearby train tracks, guards' room and porters' store, refreshment rooms, goods shed, weighbridge, and administration buildings, also demonstrates the importance of Maryborough, until 1891, as the headquarters of a separate railway network. The original station master's house is a fine example of a residence built for Queensland Government Railways during the nineteenth century, and it also demonstrates the important status of Maryborough in the railway system of the time. The air raid shelter is important as surviving evidence of the air raid precautions that were implemented as part of the defence of Queensland during World War II. Designed to afford protection for civilian and military travellers at Maryborough railway station in the event of a Japanese air raid, the shelter is important in demonstrating the impact of World War II on Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Maryborough railway station is rare as a substantially intact coastal terminal and system headquarters complex of timber buildings, established in the 1870s and 1880s. The air raid shelter is a rare example of a concrete public air raid shelter designed by Queensland Railways during World War II to provide protection for the travelling public during air raids. It is one of only two railway station shelters surviving on the North Coast railway line, the other being located at Landsborough. Only four such shelters survive in Queensland, the only Australian state to build air raid shelters at railway stations. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The existing railway sidings and timber buildings provide a highly intact example of a nineteenth century railway station complex that was expanded substantially in the early twentieth century. Significant components include a residence, main station building, goods shed, and ancillary buildings such as the weighbridge, guard's room and porter's store, refreshment rooms, and administration buildings, including a pay office. The pay windows and barriers to the pay office demonstrate the obsolete practice of workers queuing to collect their wages. The core of the Maryborough railway station building, constructed in 1880, is the oldest timber station building to survive at a major Queensland railway station. The station building is substantially intact and its design is representative of Queensland Government Railways' best practice at the time. The extensions to the station building, and possibly the original building, are associated with the work of the important railway architect, Henrick Hansen. The original station master's residence (erected in 1878) is a good example of an early and substantial Queensland Government Railways residence adapted to the sub-tropical climate with features including wide screened verandahs. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The timber railway buildings, and the large fig (Ficus sp.) tree in front of the traffic manager and engineer's office, have considerable aesthetic value and contribute significantly to the streetscape along Lennox Street. In particular, the railway station building, its early platform verandah, and the original station master's residence are of a handsome design.

All modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, Germany is a parliamentary republic.  History of democracy  History of democracy - democracy can be traced back from the present day to classical Athens in the 6th century B.C.E. * Athenian democracy - democracy in the Greek city-state of Athens developed around the fifth century BC, making Athens one of the first known democracies in the world, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica. It was a system of direct democracy, in which eligible citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills. ** Solon (c. 638 ‚Äì c. 558 BC)- Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet. Legislated against political, economic, and moral decline in archaic Athens. His reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.Stanton, G.R.

He reformed the constitution of ancient Athens and set it on a democratic footing in 508/7 BC. ** Ephialtes (died 461 BC) - led the democratic revolution against the Athenian aristocracy, which exerted control through the Areopagus, the most powerful body in the state.Fornara-Samons, Athens from Cleisthenes to Pericles, 24‚Äì25 Ephialtes proposed a reduction of the Areopagus' powers, and the Ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes' proposal without opposition. This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of \\"radical democracy\\" for which Athens would become famous. ** Pericles - arguably the most prominent and influential Greek statesman. When Ephialtes was assassinated for overthrowing the elitist Council of the Aeropagus, his deputy Pericles stepped in. He was elected strategos (one of ten such posts) in 445 BCE, which he held continuously until his death in 429 BCE, always by election of the Athenian Assembly. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is known as the \\"Age of Pericles\\". ** Ostracism - procedure under the Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years. ** Areopagus - council of elders of Athens, similar to the Roman Senate. Like the Senate, its membership was restricted to those who had held high public office, in this case that of Archon.Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians ¬ß3 In 594 BC, the Areopagus agreed to hand over its functions to Solon for reform. Later, Ephialtes radically reduced its powers. ** Ecclesia - principal assembly of the democracy of ancient Athens during its \\"Golden Age\\" (480‚Äì404 BCE). It was the popular assembly, open to all male citizens with 2 years of military service. In 594 BC, Solon allowed all Athenian citizens to participate, regardless of class, even the thetes (manual laborers). * Federalist Papers - * Potsdam Declaration - * Third Wave Democracy -  Democratic process   Elections  * Election rules ** Elective rights - include eligibility (the right to run for office, that is, the right to be a candidate), and suffrage (the civil right to vote gained through the democratic process). ** Voting - a method for a group such as a meeting or an electorate to make a decision or express an opinion‚Äîoften following discussions, debates, or election campaigns. *** Crossover voting - a behavior in which voters who normally participate in the primary of one party instead vote in the primary of another party. *** One vote, one value - a legislative principle of democracy whereby each electorate has the same population within a specified percentage of variance. *** Right of foreigners to vote - voting rights extended to non-citizens. *** Suffrage - the right to vote gained through the democratic process. **** Universal suffrage - *** Voting system - **** Single winner system **** Multiple winner system **** Proxy voting - **** Secret ballot - * Electoral fraud - illegal interference with the process of an election. Acts of fraud affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called voter fraud, the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls and improper vote counting. What electoral fraud is under law varies from country to country. ** Show election - election that is held purely for show, that is, without any significant political purpose. Show elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that still feel the need to establish some element of public legitimacy.

He was a founding Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Early life Stephen Simpson was born on 29 July 1793 in Wolston, Warwickshire, England, the son of Thomas Simpson and his wife Anne (n√©e Bank). From 1813 to 1817 he was a soldier with the 4th Light Dragoons. After that he studied medicine in Edinburgh. He became interested in homeopathy. Queensland years Simpson immigrated to Queensland, arriving first in Sydney on the Wilmot and then arriving in Moreton Bay in July 1840. Stephen Simpson was appointed Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Moreton Bay District in 1842 when the area was first opened up for free settlement following the closure of the penal colony. He was a doctor of medicine, a Justice of the Peace, a police magistrate and a founding Member of the Queensland Legislative Council following separation from New South Wales. In 1843 he undertook an exploration of the Wide Bay district. Wolston House, now in the suburb of Wacol, 1890 His first home in the colony was at Woogaroo (now Goodna), situated between Brisbane and Ipswich on what was to become the site of the Wolston Park Hospital. In 1851, when the opportunity to buy land in the area arose, he purchased to the east of his first house on land overlooking the Brisbane River. There he constructed a two-room brick cottage over a sandstone basement. The house was shingled and had a detached kitchen. This cottage now forms the core of the heritage-listed Wolston House. Simpson established a Border Police Station on Woogaroo Creek/Brisbane River in early 1843. He travelled throughout the Moreton Bay area for his work, part of which involved local Aboriginal people. His border police were involved in the Battle of One Tree Hill. Note: Dr Ray Kerkhove, owner of this site, is a reputable historian. See here and here. Simpson had designated his nephew, John Ommaney (for whom Mount Ommaney is named) as his heir. On 11 March 1856 the young man was riding from Wolston station and was thrown from his horse. The horse returned to Wolson and a search was undertaken. Ommaney was found on the ground insensible and, despite medical attention, died. His body was taken by steamer to be buried in the Church of England cemetery at Paddington.Queensland Index of Deaths, 1856/B9 John Ommanney This may have affected Simpson's commitment to remaining in the colony and a few years later, he put the Wolston estate up for sale and returned to England. According to the auction notice which appeared in the Moreton Bay Courier of 3 January 1860 the estate was by then well established with of fenced land, an extensive garden and orchards and 250 head of horses and 400 of cattle. Later life Although appointed on 23 May 1860 as a life member of the Queensland Legislative Council, Simpson attended only once before he travelled to England. He was granted a leave of absence from the Council under September 1864. However, Simpson never returned to Queensland and resigned from the Council on 3 February 1865. Simpson died on Thursday 11 March 1869 at Bryanston street, Portman Square, Marylebone, London.

L. Lucas (Golden Cockerel Press, 1948) James Frank Edgar Mansfield (11 February 1907 ‚àí 10 August 1996) was an English-New Zealand bookbinder and sculptor, who has been described as the \\"main inspiration behind modern British bookbinding\\". Early life and education Mansfield was born in London in 1907 and died in Bearsted, Kent 10 August 1996. In 1911 his parents emigrated to New Zealand, settling in Hastings. Mansfield matriculated from Napier Boys' High School in 1923 and studied art in Dunedin at the King Edward Technical College with William Allen and Robert Nettleton Field. After four years teaching at the Feilding Agricultural School (now Feilding High School) he travelled to London in 1934 to continue his studies. In London Mansfield studied pottery at the Camberwell School of Art & Crafts, bookbinding at the Central School of Art & Crafts, and design at the Reimann School. Mansfield served with the British army from 1941 to 1946 in both England and India; he was repatriated to New Zealand but returned to London in 1947. Work In the late 1940s Mansfield decided to focus on bookbinding. His work re-energised the art form: > Instead of adopting the traditional decorative motifs of the bookbinder, he > looked to contemporary fine art for inspiration. His bold and expressive > designs, derived from the language of abstract art, helped to revitalise the > craft of bookbinding during the 1940s and 1950s. Mansfield also taught at the London College of Printing (now the London College of Communication) from 1948 to 1964, where his colleagues included bookbinder Ivor Robinson. He continued binding, though less consistently, until 1976, when failing eyesight forced him to give up the craft and return to sculpture and drawing. Mansfield returned to New Zealand following his retirement. Though largely living in England for most of his adult life he visited New Zealand frequently and maintained contact with New Zealand friends and artists, thinking of himself as ‚Äúa New Zealander through and through‚Äù. Between 1981 and 1985 plans were made for a book about Mansfield to be published by Ian and Joyce Vigor Brown, owners of the Vigor Brown Gallery in Napier. A text was commissioned from anthropologist Terence Barrow, Brian Brake photographed Mansfield's sculptures, Mansfield wrote a text about his life and approach to his work, and the Governor-General of the time Sir David Beattie contributed an introduction. The book never reached publication but a slightly edited version of Mansfield's text, with Brake's photographs, was printed in the journal Art New Zealand in 2007. In the text, on the topic 'The Importance of Line', Mansfield wrote > For more than sixty years drawing and especially line drawing, has played > the vital role in all my work. So has music, notably the violin ‚Äî a line > 'singing'. I love the words of Paul Klee ‚Äî 'taking a line for a walk'. It > has been the adventure of these lines, and the resulting shapes and spaces, > between and beyond, which has been my primary interest. Hundreds, possibly > thousands of creative drawings, have evolved my personal development in art, > and provided the source background of my bookbinding and sculpture, which > are essentially tooled drawings on an almost flat surface. Recognition Mansfield served as the first president of the Guild of Contemporary Bookbinders, between 1955 and 1968, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1980. In the 1979 Queen's Birthday Honours, Mansfield was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services as a bookbinder and sculptor. The Mansfield Medal, awarded in the annual British Designer Bookbinders Society competition, is named in his honour.

Site  The summit of the mountain shows trances of ancient settlement from the prehistoric period, with clear traces of the postholes of a hut, probably belonging to the Casteluccio culture. A little way away is the imposing structure itself, carved in the limestone rock and measuring 18 x 16 metres, with 32 columns designed to support rock slabs. Part of the structure has collapsed, but many of the columns remain standing. The scale of the monument drew the attention of the traveller Jean-Pierre Hou√´l who drew some sketches of it in 1777, along with some interesting written testimony: 300px View of the columns from the right But it was the archaeologist Paolo Orsi who first investigated its possible functions. He theorised that it was a cistern used to supply water to soldiers present in the fortified area. The remains of fortifications of the Greek period are actually visible around the mountain, which allow one to imagine a purely military use of the site, which dominates the Plain of Catana and the city of Lentini. The structure was later reused by the Byzantines, who converted it into a church. Some traces of religious frescoes are even visible on some of the columns, but they are not legible. Throughout the area, various hypogeic structures of unclear purpose are visible, as well as a small temple of Demeter and Kore.  Other theories  After Paolo Orsi, the site was not subject to further archaeological excavation and as a result information on it is scarce. However, a different hypothetical function has been suggested for the structure - as a granary rather than a reservoir. The site later became associated with the ancient Brikinnai mentioned by Thucydides in the History of the Peloponnesian War: However the absence of any decisive elements and of archaeological evidence prevents any certainty.  State of the site  Currently the area is completely abandoned. There is no form of protection or plans to install security. Inside, the site is increasingly thick with vegetation which prevents inspection and some of the remains are in danger of collapse. There are traces of illegal excavation all across the mountain.

The revolt targeted the settlement of the Amhara people and feudalistic system in place in the Ethiopian Empire. Background 1960 Ethiopian military coup On 13 December 1960, an attempt was made to overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie. The coup took place after the emperor left Ethiopia on a trip to Brazil. In the beginning of the revolt, rebels captured the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and kidnapped the Ethiopian prince, 20 cabinet members, and many predominant politicians. In early stages, the coup was supported by the Imperial Guard. The Imperial Guard soon turned on the coup after the return of Emperor Haile on 17 December 1960. The forces of the Imperial Guard soon recaptured the city of Addis Ababa and freed government captives. The coup from that point on was considered a failure. Today, some sources argue the 1960 Ethiopian coup was the first major questioning of the Ethiopian government. Ethiopian Student Movement The movement began in the early 1960s. University students in Ethiopia questioned the government and monarchical rule. The small rebellion turned into a full-fledged student movement by 1967. Protesters were often determined to destroy and dismantle the entrenched feudal order to significantly improve the political and economic modernization of Ethiopia. Many protesters partook in frequent and violence-oriented verbal attacks on African governments for their corruption and abuse of power. The movement ended in 1974 and the Ethiopian Civil War began soon after. Revolt The revolt is believed to have started as a result of many peasants in the southeastern region of Ethiopia, primarily composed of the Oromo people and Somali tribesmen, refusing to pay taxes and allow access to land to the Ethiopian government. The peasants also had strong opposition of the settlement of the Amhara people in Bale. The revolt was led by Oromo leader and rebel figure Waqo Gutu and supported by the Somali government. Waqo Gutu is believed to have started the rebellion when he received no government aid after a conflict over grazing rights. After receiving no aid, he went to Somalia to supply himself and other rebels with weapons.Marina and David Ottaway, Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution (New York: Africana, 1978), pp. 92f In one of the landmark battles at Malka Anna near Ganale River in 1963, the Oromo combatants took down two military helicopters using a non-automatic rifle called Dhombir. Hence, the period from 1963 to 1970 is locally known as the Dhombir war after the gun used by the Oromo fighters. The battle of Dhombir at Malka Anna was critical in that the rebels were able to capture and take a lot of weapons from the enemy thereby boosting their defensive capabilities. In 1969 Somalia withdrew support for the rebellion after changing government. Soon after, an agreement was reached with the Ethiopian government and many predominant Oromo leaders were pardoned marking the end of the conflict.

D. Chakravarthy in pivotal roles. It is the official Tamil remake of Arima Nambi. Stunts and action scenes were directed by Vijayan. The audio sound track of the film was released on 6 June 2015. Storyline The story begins with a girl named Anamika (Pranitha Subhash) eating golgappas when a rich brat teases a waitress. She is distressed and tells her friends why isn't anyone helping the girl. Then a guy named Shivaji a.k.a. Shiv (Manchu Vishnu) beats the rich brats. Anamika is impressed and ask for his name as well as giving her cell number and asking for his number in return. The next day she messages him and his friends compel him to message her for a date. She replies positively and the two go for their first date. Anamika is impressed by Shiv's modesty. The two then get drunk and Anamika invites him to her home. At her home the two are about to kiss when Shiv stops and goes to bathroom as he is excited. He hears a scream in the room and goes there to see that some goons are taking Anamika away. He follows them but lost track of them when a tanker comes in front of him. He calls the police who shuns him off but Swaminath (Nagineedu), sincere police officer goes with him to Anamika's home where the security guard tells the cops he is lying and Anamika is in Goa for 4 days. They go to Anamika's flat which is all set and all the things broken during the fight are fixed. They call Anamika's father Ranganath Dasari (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao) who happens to be the CEO of channel 24 who confirms the security guard statement. Swaminath drops him home and ask him to drink less. He enters his friend's home and takes his bike. He reaches Anamika father's home and see the SI and the goons. The SI is alerted that Shiv is present there. They find him and are about to kill him when the Swaminath saves him. They see that Ranganath is being inquired by goons about a memory card in which a party clip is recorded. He says that the chip is with his senior reporter.

Meanwhile the goons leader Billu arrives and starts following them. Shiv and Anamika try to open the card but it requires a password. They go to Ranganath's office to take a diary containing all the passwords. They are still unable to crack the code and thus goes to a hotel to hack the code. They are about to open the video when Shiv's friend (Praveen) comes. It slips from his mouth that goons are following him to which Shiv replies that he never told him about the goons. Shiv's friend reveals that the goons offered him Rs. 1 crore and at the same time goons arrive and Shiv's friend is killed in a shootout. Shiv and Anamika are on the run again. They enter a mall as they come to know that the police are watching them and are on the side of goons on the order of IB minister Rishi Dev (J. D. Chakravarthy) who is behind the card. Shiv asks Anamika to gather the media and hand over the card to governor meanwhile he will distract the police.

The police tells the media that Shiv used to supply drugs to Anamika and they both killed Anamika's father and the police inspector. Meanwhile an inspector also tells the minister about the video and Shiv also sees the video when the central minister accidentally kills a model named Neha Sharma (Lekha Washington) as she is pregnant with his child. Shiv copies the video to a pendrive while the minister kills the inspector watching the video. The minister deletes the video and thus not allowing it to be downloaded. Meanwhile it is revealed that the minister is a candidate for being the Prime Minister. Shiv summons a meeting with the minister, where Shiv tricks him into taking a bag containing bomb. Shiva through a distraction takes the minister in a train. The police is on the run. Shiva starts recording the minister while Anamika send the link of video to renowned news channels. Just then the police force gathered on the spot and they arrest Shiv. However, the video showing that the minister is saying that he killed Neha Sharma is still being telecast by a button camera which is revealed later. Seeing the video, the high command ordered the police to release Shiva and arrest the minister. The scene then shifts to Shiv and Anamika giving Rs. 2 crore to Swaminath's daughter for her father's work and the film ends with the two going to Shiv's home together.

Background The feud arose out of personal grievances between Paris Brumfield (c.1837‚Äì1891), a distiller, storekeeper, and timber man, and Canaan \\"Cain\\" Adkins (1833‚Äì1896), a United Baptist preacher, country physician, schoolteacher, and justice of the peace. A great deal of the early trouble centered on ownership of a key piece of real estate at the mouth of Harts Creek. Aside from the Brumfield- Adkins quarrel, the feud included family quarrels between Henderson Dingess (1829‚Äì1902), a distiller, and his brother-in-law, Benjamin Adams (1854‚Äì1910), a timber boss, and the Halls, one of whom had married Dingess' son, Floyd. The feud By the mid-1880s, the Brumfield-Adkins vendetta, the Dingess- Adams vendetta, and the Dingess-Hall vendetta had become hopelessly entangled, partly due to the marriage of Allen \\"Al\\" Brumfield (1860‚Äì1905), merchant son of Paris, and Hollena Dingess (1863‚Äì1937), daughter of Henderson. While Paris Brumfield continued his personal feud with Cain Adkins and his family, Al Brumfield feuded with Ben Adams, his uncle-in-law, John W. Runyon (1855‚Äì1925), storekeeper, tavern operator, and deputy sheriff, and others due to matters of business, politics, or land. The Lincoln County Feud ranks as the second-most famous feud in West Virginia history, trumped only by the Hatfield-McCoy Feud, which occurred in the nearby Tug Valley. During its hey-day, the Lincoln feud commanded headlines in newspapers throughout the United States. It resulted in four confirmed deaths and the extermination or out-migration of some of the community's leading citizens, established Harts Creek as one of West Virginia's most violent communities, and may have triggered the movement of a county boundary. Allen \\"Al\\" Brumfield, 1890s. Courtesy of Brandon R. Kirk Deaths  * Popular culture In 1925, Professor John Harrington Cox published Folk-Songs of the South, which included a ballad titled \\"A West Virginia Feud Song\\" that detailed key events in the Lincoln County Feud. The following year, regional historian and educator Fred B. Lambert presented a brief account of the feud, including a better version of Cox's ballad titled \\"The Lincoln County Crew,\\" which he attributed to George W. Ferrell. In 1986 and 1992, Goldenseal magazine, West Virginia's premiere publication of state culture and history, resurrected the story and published two accounts of the feud. During the early 1990s, Brandon Ray Kirk, a local historian and descendant of feudists, began to research the feud story, mostly compiling oral histories and consulting available newspaper accounts. Between 1995 and 2001, Kirk partnered with country music star John Hartford to research the feud. During that time, Hartford and Kirk primarily investigated the life of Ed Haley, one of the most significant musicians of his era, whose father had been murdered in the Lincoln County Feud. In 1997, Rounder Records released a four CD set of Haley's home recordings from the late 1940s, titled Forked Deer and Grey Eagle, which featured liner notes by Hartford and Kirk regarding the feud. In 1998, Hartford released the Haley-inspired and Grammy-nominated CD The Speed of the Old Long Bow, which included some feud-era musical selections. In the late 1990s, Kirk and Hartford published a brief history of the feud in the West Virginia Encyclopedia. Hartford and Kirk also collaborated with Douglas W. Owsley, Division Head of Physical Anthropology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), to exhume the grave of two feudists. In March 2000, Smithsonian magazine published a story regarding the dig. Ed Haley's music appeared in the movie O Brother Where Art Thou? which won a Grammy in 2001. In 2014, Kirk published Blood in West Virginia: Brumfield v. McCoy (Pelican Publishing Company: Gretna, LA), which details the story of the Lincoln County Feud.

She started publishing on the social storytelling platform Wattpad. The print edition of the series was published in 2014 by Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, and has been translated into several languages. The film adaptation of the first book was released on April 12, 2019, by Aviron Pictures, and the second in September 2020. Career Todd's writing was initially inspired by the music and fandom of One Direction, and the singer Harry Styles is a model for the protagonist in her After series, under the name Hardin Scott. She started by writing stories on her phone with the Wattpad app in 2013, publishing a chapter almost daily for over a year. Todd wrote three books in the After series on Wattpad. The series has sometimes been compared to the Fifty Shades trilogy as both series had their start as fan fiction. Reviewers at the website Jezebel criticized the series and stated that it \\"echoes the troubling dynamics of 50 Shades,\\" as they felt that Hardin's character \\"behaves at best like a prick, at worst like an abusive boyfriend in the making.\\" In 2015 Todd announced that she would be publishing Before, a prequel novel that tells the events of After from the perspective of Hardin Scott. Her next book, The Spring Girls, a re- telling of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, was published in 2018. In October 2014, Paramount Pictures acquired film rights to the After series with Offspring Entertainment (Step Up franchise, Rock of Ages) set to produce. The film, based on her first book, was eventually released by Aviron Pictures on April 12, 2019. Josephine Langford portrays Tessa, the female protagonist, and Hero Fiennes Tiffin portrays Hardin, the male protagonist. Personal life Todd grew up in Dayton, Ohio. She married her husband Jordan, an American soldier, at 18 and the two moved to Fort Hood, Texas, where she worked at a Waffle House and the makeup counter of ULTA Beauty. She has a son named Asher with her husband. She also has an older brother and younger sister. Todd briefly shared a mailbox with Austin film critic Korey Coleman. Years later, he would review the film adaptation of her novel After, though he gave it a negative review.

It is a fanciful reconstruction of the medieval Eleanor cross at Charing, one of several memorial crosses erected by Edward I of England in memory of his first wife. The Victorian monument was designed by Edward Middleton Barry, also the architect of the railway station, and includes multiple statues of Queen Eleanor by the sculptor Thomas Earp. It does not occupy the original site of the Charing Cross (destroyed in 1647), which is now occupied by Hubert Le Sueur's equestrian statue of Charles I. Barry based the memorial on the three surviving drawings of the Charing Cross, in the Bodleian Library, the British Museum and the collection of the Royal Society of Antiquaries. However, due to the fragmentary nature of this evidence, he also drew from a wider range of sources including the other surviving Eleanor crosses and Queen Eleanor's tomb at Westminster Abbey. In this search for precedents Barry was assisted by his fellow architect Arthur Ashpitel. The coats of arms of England, Le√≥n, Castile and Ponthieu appear on the monument.

Education Josephine Powell was born in New York City into a well-to-do family. Powell attended Cornell University, where she earned a BA in 1941. She also attended the New York School of Social Work at Columbia University where she received her Master's degree in 1945. After her graduation, Powell left the United States to start working for the International Refugee Organization (IRO).  Travels  First, she worked in Tanganyika, and later in Munich where she purchased two cameras at the PX: a Leica and a Rolleiflex. After, for many years, Josephine Powell was based in Rome, during this time. Initially she regarded these cameras as works of art; after two years she started taking amateur photographs and developed a talent for photography. Her curiosity to learn more about the interesting things she trained her lens on led to an unexpected career as an architectural photographer. From 1952 to 1975, Powell traveled extensively by car, horse, alone or accompanied by her dog. In many regions, she took photographs of local monuments, of archaeology, of historical and ethnographical subjects and of museum collections. She visited and documented Afghanistan, North Africa, Greece, Kashmir, India, Iran, Italy, Nepal, East and West Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. During these travels, she also collected objects that later became part of various museum collections, such as the Wereldmuseum in Rotterdam and the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.Judith Vos (ed.) Josephine Powell (1919-2007). Traveller, photographer, collector in the Muslim world. Amsterdam: KIT Publishers, 2007 Her photographs would appear in more than 150 books and scientific publications. Several of her architectural photographs appear in Thames & Hudson's landmark survey Architecture of the Islamic World at archive.org and Islamic Art, Literature, and Culture. Powell relocated to Istanbul in 1973. After getting an assignment from Thames & Hudson for a proposed book on Turkish kilims, Powell immersed herself in Anatolian kilims and the people who made them. For years, she followed semi-nomadic Anatolians in her VW Caravan, documenting their daily lives, with especial attention to their manufacture of textiles. She also documented kilims and other textiles she found in villages and village mosques. She also, with Harald B√∂hmer, researched and studied the natural dyes used to produce the colors in antique textiles. Together, in Turkey's Aegean region, they set up the DOBAG Carpet Initiative of weavers, using natural dyes and traditional weaving techniques to produce new carpets, engaging a younger generation in the traditions of carpet weaving, and opening markets for their work. Sadberk Hanƒ±m Museum in B√ºy√ºkdere, Sarƒ±yer Shortly before her death in January 2007, much of her Turkish collection of textiles and artifacts was donated to the Vehbi Ko√ß Foundation. Tens of thousands of Powell's photographs and associated field notes were also part of her willed donation to the Ko√ß Foundation, and now are part of Ko√ß University's Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations. Among others, longtime friend and aide Brigitte Sommer was instrumental in helping Ko√ß University properly digitalize Powell's collection. Powell's artifacts and textiles are now part of the Sadberk Hanƒ±m Museum collection in B√ºy√ºkdere, Istanbul. Other photographs (about 20,000) of ethnographic interest from her travels from 1951 to 1975 are at Harvard University, which she donated in 2002 to the Fine Arts Library at Harvard.

England's Dave Jessup won his second straight Overseas Final. Reigning World Champion Bruce Penhall caused a stir at the 1982 Overseas Final. Heat 19 of the event involved 4 riders from the USA (brothers Kelly and Shawn Moran, Penhall and his childhood friend Dennis Sigalos). Penhall, having already scored enough points to qualify for the Intercontinental Final, deliberately finished last in the heat (ending his chance of winning the meeting, though he still finished an easy third) to allow Kelly Moran and Sigalos to also qualify for the Intercontinental Final. English commentator Dave Lanning called it a circus, but also noted that it wasn't an unprecedented happening, claiming that riders from other nations had previously done similar in order to help their countrymen qualify.Speedway Star w/e 10 July 1982 1982 Overseas Final *4 July * London, White City Stadium *Qualification: Top 10 plus 1 reserve to the 1982 Intercontinental Final in Vetlanda, Sweden {class=wikitable !width=25px|Pos. ||width=200px|Rider ||width=70px|Total |-align=center |1 ||align=leftDave Jessup |13 |-align=center |2 ||align=leftKenny Carter |12 |-align=center |3 ||align=leftBruce Penhall |11 |-align=center |4 ||align=leftLarry Ross |8 |-align=center |5 ||align=leftAndy Grahame |8 |-align=center |6 ||align=leftKelly Moran |8 |-align=center |7 ||align=leftDennis Sigalos |8 |-align=center |8 ||align=leftPhil Crump |8 |-align=center |9 ||align=leftLes Collins |7+3 |-align=center |10 ||align=leftPeter Collins |7+2 |-align=center |11 ||align=leftShawn Moran |7+1 |-align=center |12 ||align=leftAlan Grahame |6 |-align=center |13 ||align=leftIvan Mauger |6 |-align=center |14 ||align=leftBilly Sanders |5 |-align=center |15 ||align=leftChris Morton |5 |-align=center |16 ||align=leftPhil Collins |1 |} References See also * Motorcycle Speedway 1982 World Individual Overseas Final Overseas Final ","title":"1982 Overseas Final"},{"id":"44846450","text":"Dolores Turchi (Oliena, 1935) is an Italian writer.
