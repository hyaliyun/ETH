It is found in northwestern New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. Description Hakea leucoptera subsp. sericipes is a small tree with an open canopy up to high, or may be a denser, multi-stemmed shrub high. It usually has straight, stiff branches and grey bark. The well spaced, long, needle- shaped leaves are a silver-grey, long, in diameter ending in a sharp point long covered in short, white silky hairs at first, but later becoming hairless. The inflorescence is a cluster of 18-45 yellow or creamy-white flowers scented flowers on a stem long and densely covered, with white, short, soft, matted hairs. The perianth is white, smooth and long. The fruit are smooth, egg-shaped, about long, wide ending with a broad beak. Flowering occurs from November to December. Taxonomy and naming Hakea leucoptera was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. In 1996 William Baker described two subspecies of H. leucoptera in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden, including this subspecies and subspecies leucoptera, and the name is accepted by the Australian Plant Census. This subspecies differs from the autonym (subspecies leucoptera) in having shiny hairs pressed against the pedicels. The subspecies epithet (sericipes) is from the Latin words sericeus meaning \\"silken\\" and pes meaning \\"a foot\\". Distribution and habitat Subspecies sericipes is found usually growing in coarse, heavier soils in New South Wales west of the Great Dividing Range and contiguous plains, either as an individual tree or thickets of underbrush shrubs.

Early life  Yevgeny Nagorny was born on June 26, 1972 in the Kharkiv Oblast. After graduation, he moved to Moscow, where he decided to get a higher education and went to college. After studying for a year, he was drafted into the army by the early 1990s. After serving, he returned to Moscow, was reinstated at the institute and continued his studies. But due to the difficult socio-economic situation in the country and problems with future employment, Nagorny was forced to quit school and find a job. He mastered the mechanic profession and soon decided to go into business, opening the AutoLux service center in a hangar rented by him on the territory of one of the military units on the Projected Drive. However, things did not go well for the company: there was not enough money for either purchasing spare parts or for rent. And soon in the hangar one customer's expensive Jeep burned down. Creditors and the owner of the Jeep began to threaten Nagorny, and he soon came up with a simple scheme: to kill the owners of expensive cars, finding them through newspaper ads, and then selling the new cars. He took as an assistant the worker Sergei Stavitsky, who was ready to do anything for money, and they committed all subsequent crimes together.  Crimes  The first crime Nagorny and Stavitsky committed was on January 2, 1998 - their first victim being the owner of a Lada Niva. The criminals had an according modus operandi. According to advertisements in the newspaper \\"From hand to hand\\", they scheduled a meeting with the victim and then agreed to meet. During the pre-sale inspection of the car, they said it was necessary to check it in detail at the service station. Then would then drive the car into the hangar, where they killed the owner with a pistol and dumped the body into the sewers through a manhole located inside the hangar. Since the Niva could only be sold for cheap, almost all the following murders committed by Nagorny and Stavitsky were against owners of foreign cars. After this, Nagorny and Stavitsky committed another 9 murders. Their victims were company executives, car drivers and even other criminals: for example, in March 1998 they killed two members of the Solntsevskaya Bratva in their hangar. The loot from the murders was rich: three Grand Cherokees, a Mitsubishi Pajero, an Audi, a VAZ-2109 and three Mercedes-Benz jeeps. Nagorny soon sold all of them, naturally, at a low price: the maximum amount they got from selling a car was 8,000 dollars.  Arrest, trial and sentence  The killers were traced on accident: when Nagorny was negotiating with his latest victim in a meeting, he did not know that his victim had a caller ID turned on, and the number was registered to the company \\"AutoLux\\". When the police arrived at the service station, the hangar was closed, but sounds of active work could be heard from inside, and they decided to wait. Late at night, a Volga arrived at the hangar, from which Stavitsky and a friend disembarked. Both were detained, and the authorities soon broke into the hangar and arrested Nagorny. All doubts from the investigators were dissipated immediately when, under the hangar's concrete floor, a bag was found containing bloodied items belonging to the victims, including license plates, a pistol holster and an empty magazine. The Makarov pistol itself, which was the weapon used in all the killings, was later found on one of the traverse floor beams under the ceiling. The corpses could not be located on the first day, however. Nagorny denied everything, but Stavitsky behaved nervously: when left alone for five minutes in the investigative office, he opened his handcuffs with a nail clipper and tried to hang himself using his sneaker's shoelaces. He managed to survive, and when he recovered, he began testifying. All 10 corpses were found in the sewer and a concreted pit, which was dug under Nagorny's service station, without knowing what it would be intended for. Realizing there was no use of denying, Nagorny confessed to everything. Stavitsky tried to commit suicide several times more, but did not succeed. However, he still managed to avoid punishment, as a forensic psychiatric examination revealed signs of a mental illness, and he was sent for involuntary commitment. Nagorny was found guilty by the court under the Criminal Code of Russia in April 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment.Definition of appeal by convicted Nagorny to the Moscow City Court on April 9, 1999 At the trial, where, among others, members of the Solntsevskaya Bratva were present, he behaved defiantly, standing with his back to the victims' relatives. When the judge announced the verdict, the gangsters shouted at Nagorny: \\"We will bury you alive!\\". The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict, and these were Nagorny words while in the Supreme Court: \\"Why did you give a life sentence to me, a Russian citizen, a patriot who gave you two years of his life in the service of his Homeland, and this Homeland thanks me as much?\\" When the film crew of \\"Criminal Russia\\" came to interview Nagorny after the Supreme Court meeting, he said: \\"You are catching up with horror in Russia! They called it \\"Criminal Russia\\", it's horrific! That you are catching up with the people...show the good things about me! Blood, murder...who needs all this?\\". Yevgeny Nagorny is currently serving his sentence at the Black Dolphin Prison.  Riddles from the investigation  Some questions remain unanswered, as few people believed that the murders were committed solely by Nagorny and Stavitsky. Incidentally, Nagorny said this himself at his trial: \\"I fulfilled the wishes of my clients ‚Äì influential people and are still respected by me.\\" But who these \\"clients\\" were, remains unknown. In his testimony, Stavitsky mentioned that Nagorny was recording client data in a special notebook, but he could not find where he kept it. It is possible that each car was assigned by criminals in a specific order.  In the media  * One episode from the Independent Investigation program (NTV, 2000) was dedicated to the Nagorny case. * In 2000, the series Criminal Russia had an episode titled \\"The Car Service of Blood\\" based on the Nagorny case.

This led Eric G. Bruggink, senior judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims, to place the contract award on hold. In August 2019, weeks before the winner was expected to be announced, President Donald Trump ordered the contract placed on hold again for Defense Secretary Mark Esper to investigate complaints of favoritism towards Amazon. In October 2019, it was announced that the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Media has noted Trump's dislike towards Amazon's founder, Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, a newspaper critical of Trump.

Background Poitrel was bred by the Moses brothers at Arrowfield Stud in New South Wales in 1914. At the 1916 Sydney yearling sales he failed to reach his 300 Guineas reserve price and was therefore retained by the brothers. Racing career Poitrel was often described as plain and wiry. He also suffered from hoof problems, so he was sparingly raced. Nevertheless he blossomed to become a champion stayer. He was trained astutely throughout his career by H.J. Robinson. In Poitrel‚Äôs four- and five-year-old seasons, he proved almost unbeatable, winning 16 races in Sydney including two dead-heats. His usual jockey was Ken Bracken. Among the other horses he vanquished were acknowledged champions in their own right, Desert Gold, Gloaming and Eurythmic. For this reason, as a six-year-old, he was allocated the handicap of 10 stone (63.5 kg) for the 1920 Melbourne Cup. Poitrel,1920 Randwick Plate winner Melbourne Cup Poitrel started the race wide, trailed the field for most of the race, and then came home in the final stages to win by half a length. Some reporters called it the performance of a century: ‚ÄòHe is entitled to be included among the limited band of great horses that have raced in Australia‚Äô. His victory under this heavy burden was Poitrel‚Äôs only appearance in Melbourne, but racegoers at Flemington responded to the achievement. Stud career Poitrel was retired to Arrowfield Stud, where he stood until the stud was sold, in 1924. He then went to L.K.S. Mackinnon‚Äôs Maribyrnong Stud, Melbourne. The best of his progeny was Begamba who won St Leger Stakes‚Äô in three states. Poitrel died on the 2 May 1932 while performing stud duties at Tarong Station north of Toowoomba, Queensland.

As a result of legislation introduced by the Church Minister Carl Hermansen in 1947, the following year, together with Edith Brenneche Petersen and Ruth Vermehren, she was ordained by Bishop Hans √òllgaard in Odense Cathedral. Denmark thus became the first country in the world to have women priests. Andersen was the first woman in Denmark to serve as a parish priest. In 1948, she was appointed parish priest in N√∏rre √òrslev on the island of Falster and later moving to Vigerslev Church in Copenhagen. In 1965, she became the parish priest of the newly established Margarethe Church, also in Copenhagen. Biography Born on 11 September in Virket on the island of Falster, Johanne Hermansen Andersen was the daughter of the estate owner Lars Peter Andersen (1871‚Äì1945) and Anna Hermansen (1875‚Äì1963). While still young, she spent a winter at Askov H√∏jskole, a Grundtvigian folk high school. Keen to study, she matriculated from the Copenhagen school Akademisk Studenterkursus, enabling her to read theology at the University of Copenhagen. Even as a student, she began to call for changes in the law which would authorize the ordination of women as priests. A member of the Danish Women's Society, she wrote an article in the organization's magazine Kvinden og Samfundet urging women to become members of parish councils in order to press for the admission of women priests. On graduating in theology in 1945, she continued her studies the following year at Uppsala University in Sweden where she embarked on church history. While teaching at Askovs H√∏jskole in the summer of 1946, she was invited to become the priest at N√∏rre √òrslev Church where she had recently preached. Realizing that the existing parish priest Mads Peter Schmidt was nearing retirement age, in October 1946 the parochial council decreed that Andersen should become their parish priest. She was appointed to serve as Schmidt's assistant in 1947. As a result of continuing political pressure from the N√∏rre √òrslev parochial council, the Rigsdag adopted legislation allowing women to become priests. In 1948, the bishop of Funen, Hans √òllgaard, ordained Andersen together with Edith Brenneche Petersen and Ruth Vermehren, making them the first three women to become Church of Denmark priests. The same year, Johanne Andersen was therefore officially appointed to the post of parish priest in N√∏rre √òrslev. Despite strong initial opposition to her ordination, Andersen became a committed member of the local branch of the Kirkeligt Samfund (church association), chairing it from 1952. In 1957, she was engaged by the much larger Vigerslev Church in Copenhagen. Her energetic efforts towards the establishment of a new church to serve the district culminated in 1965 with the opening of Margrathe Church where she was appointed parish priest. On retiring in 1975, she moved back to her native Falster. Johanne Andersen died in Nyk√∏bing Falster on 30 September 1999.

For showing this great devotion the lord extinguished the fire. During sangam era, south India was ruled by many local kings. They were all to pay tax to the three Emperors of South India (Cholas, Pandyas, Cheras). One of these kings, Vƒìl PƒÅri, is described as the master of the hill country of Parambu nƒÅdu and held sway over 300 villages.Epigraphia Indica, Volume 25, page 91 Pari patronized various forms of art, literature and bards thronged his court.Traditions of Indian classical dance, page 45 The territory of Parambu nƒÅdu consisted of parts of modern-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala, stretching from Piranmalai in Sivaganga district, Tamil Nadu to Nedungadi in Palakkad district, Kerala.

It is also known as St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church & School, St Brigid's, and St Bridget's. The property is owned by Saint Brigid's Roman Catholic Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. St Brigid's Church is the oldest surviving place of Catholic worship in Australia.  History  The Roman Catholic Church was not formally recognised in Australia until 1820 with the arrival of Fathers Connolly and Therry, although unofficial churches and schools are believed to have operated in the colony prior to that time. St Brigid's is typical of the early development of educational facilities in New South Wales, which were either privately operated or church run. State run schools did not come into being until the National School system began in the 1840s. St Brigid's is believed to be the oldest church run school surviving in New South Wales (predating the Catholic school at Camperdown by five years). The original design of St Brigid's, established as St Bridget's, has been attributed to Bishop Dr William Bernard Ullathorne . It was originally designed as a single storey sandstone building containing a classroom and a separate chapel. Construction commenced in 1834, using ‚Äústone which is close at hand‚Äù. The single storey building was completed in April 1835. The completed building was handed over in May 1835 and was put into use immediately. A partition of folding doors divided the interior in half, providing separate class-rooms for the boys and girls. On Sundays, the school doubled as a chapel for Mass. Pupils were initially under the care of the Christian Brothers, but by the 1870s the school had been taken over by the Sisters of Mercy. In the early 1930s Father Daniel Hurley, Parish Priest of St Patrick's, sought and gained permission to build another storey on top of the original classroom and chapel. The original sandstone classroom and chapel were converted to the church and apse visible today. The extended school was opened on 31 August 1933. In 1933 an upper storey was added to St Bridget's, and at that time the present spelling (St Brigid's) came to be adopted. The upper storey construction allowed the original ground floor building to be used exclusively as a chapel. In 1992 the school closed because of falling enrolments. Restoration work commenced during 2002 and 2003 for maintenance and conservation of the interior and exterior historic chapel.  Description  The site lies on the west facing slope of Observatory Hill, a sandstone bluff which separates Sydney Cove from Darling Harbour.  Condition  As at 23 April 2003, a detailed archaeological research design report was prepared and submitted with the Section 60 application as required by the General Terms of Approval issued by the Heritage Council on 13 June 2002.Application No. 02/IDA22, see Annexure D. According to the archaeological research design report, until 1833 the whole site was part of an extensive sandstone quarry then in May 1835 the church building was completed and opened as a school. It is possible that artefacts related to the school were deposited in the southern yard from this time. In about 1935 the second storey was built into the church for use as the school, so that the ground floor room could be devoted exclusively to its use as a church. During these building works and improvements the level of the southern yard was raised with a new bitumen surface. This would have sealed in any earlier archaeological remains from the use of the area as the yard for the school and its sometimes use as a church. In summary the Archaeological Research Design report concludes that the southern yard, which is to be excavated as a result of the proposed works, is not of high archaeological significance  Heritage listing  As at 23 April 2003, St Brigid's Church and School is of State significance because: * it is the oldest building in Australasia in continuous use for religious services for the Roman Catholic faith. The ground floor sandstone section, which still functions as a church, has been in use since 1835 (Grading of Significance: Exceptional ); * the site has strong associations with Bishop Ullathorne (the first senior Catholic churchman to function in Australia) who was instrumental in placing the Church on a formal footing in New South Wales (Grading of Significance: Exceptional ); * the building is one of the few surviving works by the Colonial Architect Ambrose Hallen (Grading of Significance: High );and * the building makes a visual contribution to the local historic precinct, which is recognised as being of national significance (Grading of Significance: High).John Graham and Associates, February 2002. St Brigid's Church and School documents the religious and educational life of the local society over an exceptional length of time and may have special significance for the history of the Roman Catholic community in Australia.13/06/1989, Ref: HC 89/0767.

Thick sedimentary sequences from the Phanerozoic (including sandstone, anhydrite, dolomite, limestone, chert and marl) dominate much of the country's surface and host oil. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics Saudi Arabia is underlain by the Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Proterozoic Arabian Craton. Up to of sedimentary rocks from the Cambrian through the Pliocene accumulated on the shield, including many oil-bearing units. Within these younger rocks, a large western facing escarpment formed in central Saudi Arabia, capped with limestone. Basement rock dips away from the escarpment with thicker sediments in the Rub' al Khali and the Persian Gulf region. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) of Paleozoic rocks are exposed in the northwest, with the lowest correlated with the Cambrian in Jordan. The top is limestone, although most units from the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian are terrestrial sandstone or shale. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) The Triassic begins with the Khuff Formation shallow water limestone and ascends through of Jurassic shelf limestone and marine shale, overlain by fossil-rich rocks from the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous. Jurassic rocks form much of the escarpment in central Saudi Arabia, although discontinuous sedimentation led to the deposition of calcarenite and anhydrite. The alternating layers of the Arab Formation took shape during the time and hold extensive oil and gas resources. The Kimmeridgian age Jubaila Limestone contains the high productivity Arab-D member in the Ghawar oil field and a -long sequence of aphanitic and calcarenite limestone. It often weathers to prominent scarps without talus. For the most part, Middle Cretaceous rocks include thick sandstone, although some marine rocks are present to the north and Jordan. A combined sequence of of limestone and dolomite spans the Cretaceous into the Paleogene. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) The Umm er Rhaduma Formation, named by S.B. Henry and C.W. Brown in 1935 is the oldest Cenozoic sedimentary unit in Saudi Arabia, from the Paleocene to the early Eocene. It is visible in the walls of Wadi al Batin and overlies the dolomite and limestone of the Aruma Formation. The formation spans 1200 kilometers from Wadi Jabaliyah to the Iraq-Saudi Arabia border. Karst commonly forms in the uplands along with river channels. Northwest of Al Batin, the rock has very poor internal drainage. Drilling revealed two monocline structures were related to the dissolution and collapse of anhydrite layers. Dolomite, limestone and chert with some fossiliferous units are particularly common. Dissolved hydrogen gas renders water from the unit poor quality near Ras Tenura, Abqaiq and Nariya. Saudi Aramco developed the unit to supply water to its outlying operations. The unit formation is overlain by the early Eocene Rus Formation, named for Umm ar Ru'us. Originally known as the Chalky Zone, it was renamed in 1946. It occurs only a few places, extending 180 kilometers north of Wadi as Sahba and occupying the breached center of the Dammam Dome. Chalk and limestone ascend to gypsum-bearing and calcareous shale. Coastal Saudi Arabia was only submerged briefly in the Cenozoic, limiting marine deposition, although the few Miocene and Pliocene marine rock are divided into the Dam, Hofuf and Hadrukh formations. The early and middle Eocene Damman Formation is named for the Dammam Dome and includes basal marl, limestone and dolomite as well as the Saila Shale Member. It is exposed above the Umm er Rhaduma but largely overlapped by Miocene and Pliocene sediments and occurs in larger areas near the border with Qatar and in a five kilometer wide, 180 kilometer long belt from Wadi as Sahba. The marl, limestone and shale units taken together do store groundwater and communities in the Eastern Province often draw on the Alat aquifer in the Khobar Member. Groundwater conditions vary widely within Cenozoic units. Al Hasa and Al Qatif are examples of oases, fed by artesian wells. Al Fufuf has a well-developed Miocene-Pliocene aquifer, likely fed in part by an underlying Eocene aquifer. Neogene groundwater supplies other scattered locations in the Eastern Province. Paleogene gravels form patches in the Wadi Nayyal and Wadi as Sahba. The round quartz pebbles can reach 10 centimeters in diameter, often accompanied by limestone pebbles. In the past, a river may have crossed the Al Aramah escarpment via the Wadi as Sahba structural trench. At the northwest edge of Harrat Hutaym are marl, sandstone and basal conglomerate deposits with ostracode fossils from a freshwater environment, inferred to be from the Pliocene. Small, similar deposits are scattered across the Rub al Khali. The Al Harrah volcanic complex is the only eruptive feature in the sediment- covered areas of Saudi Arabia. Its olivine basalt and aplite dikes formed during the Miocene, Pliocene and early Quaternary, spanning 250 kilometers to the northwest from Ath Thayat into Jordan. In the northwest, duricrust carapace is particularly common on Paleozoic and Mesozoic units due to greater moisture. In the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, limestone-quartz terrace gravel deposited in Wadi al Batin, occurring 60 to 90 kilometers north of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline. Sheet gravel blankets the Ad Dibdibah Plain, with quartz, carbonate and metamorphic rock grains spanning into Iraq and Kuwait. Al Harrah lava field basalt pebbles make up most of the gravel in the As Sahn Plain. Deltaic sheet gravels are also common in Wadi as Sahba-Wadi and Dawasir-Wadi Najran. In the Al Aramah and Hit escarpment are dissected, older limestone gravels. An Nafud and Ar Rub al Khali have silt, gravel, sabkha, unconsolidated sands and coral limestone from the geologically recent past. Half of Saudi Arabia with sedimentary cover is blanketed in eolian sands, covering an area of 600,000 square kilometers. Lake beds outcrop in the Rub al Khali while marine terraces are common along the Persian Gulf.

Design The AEC Roadtrain consisted of an eight-wheeled tractor unit and two eight wheeled trailers, the entire train was long. The roadtrain's 12 wheels were articulated and independently sprung, assisting in movement over uneven terrain. Each of the roadtrain's 12 axles were fitted with a single brake drum, alternating sides down the length of the train, whilst the braking system acted upon the rear trailer and moved with decreasing power towards to front tractor unit. Tractor unit The tractor unit was an 8x8 vehicle powered by a six-cylinder AEC diesel engine of displacement, driven through a 4 speed manual transmission and 3 speed transfer case. All wheels had single tyres, the steering for the tractor unit was from the first and forth axles, with the vehicle pivoting on the centre two axles, traction was applied to all eight wheels through four differentials. Trailers The roadtrain's eight wheeled trailers were self-tracking, following in the tracks of the tractor unit. The trailers were fitted with two bogies at either end that turned in opposite directions, each bogie fitted with a turntable connected to the other by a spring loaded linkage. History Development At the 1927 British Colonial Office conference it was determined it would be more cost effective to develop a land tractor or road train than to invest the high costs required to install railways into remote areas of the British Commonwealth. The design specifications for the land tractor were created by the British Overseas Mechanical Transport Committee, for the purpose of transporting supplies to underdeveloped areas of the British Empire. Initially the project was funded by the British and South African governments, although another twenty five Commonwealth counties later contributed finances, including Australia. Production units Prototype Leyland built Overseas Roadtrain before it went to Africa. Only four (some sources state three) AEC Roadtrains were ever produced. The first prototype unit was constructed by Leyland Motors whilst the subsequent units were all built by AEC's wholly owned subsidiary company Hardy Motors. The trailers were all produced by RA Dyson & Co of Liverpool. African unit The first AEC Roadtrain was completed in December 1930 at a cost of ¬£12,000 and was fitted with a six-cylinder petrol engine. This first unit completed of laden and unladen tests at the War Department's grounds at Farnborough, on completion of the trials the unit was shipped to the Gold Coast for further trials before it was put to work. Arriving in Takoradi in February 1933, the unit operated mostly in the Ashanti Region, predominantly traversing the of road between Kumasi and Tamale, usually being ferried across the Volta River at Yeji. It was used to carry cement, pipes, timber and bags of salt, locals, livestock and agricultural produce including millet, kolanuts and cacoa, at one stage it was trialled as a military troop carrier. The African unit proved to be successful, completing over before it was sold to the Gold Coast Government for ¬£2,000 in 1934. It is believed the petrol engine was later replaced with a diesel engine. Australian unit Government Roadtrain with two additional locally made trailers Following the success of the first road train, a second was built by AEC at a cost of ¬£7,000, the inclusion of AEC components including the engine contributing to the ¬£5,000 saving from the first vehicle. The second unit had initially been destined to go to South Africa who had been involved in funding the program from the beginning, but the Government of Australia committed to pay ¬£1,000 a year for two years to the British Overseas Mechanical Transport Committee, and on this basis a last minute decision was made to test the vehicle in Australia. Other countries considered included Southern Rhodesia, Swaziland, Tanganyika, Mauritius and India, the Government of India had been told the unit could be demonstrated and possibly remain in India following trials in Australia. Arriving in Australia in early 1934, following some local testing it set out in April from Adelaide to Alice Springs via Oodnadatta under the command of Captain (later Bridadier) EM Dollery, Chief Inspector of Mechanical Transport for the Defence Department in Australia, with a British crew comprising a Captain EC Roscoe, two driver/mechanics as well as a local cook. The road train covered the of unmade roads in three weeks, and carried all fuel and supplies for the trip. Captain Dollery later wrote: > \\"We tracked over trackless wastes of sandhills. Some days we only progressed > two or three miles.

Operated by the Department of the Interior, the Government Roadtrain was used to supply outback regions supplementing and leading to the demise of the cameleers who had before then been responsible for supplying outback Australia. The standard rate charged by Afghan and Pakistani cameleers charged two shillings and sixpence per ton per mile whilst the Government Roadtrain could charge as little as six and a half pence per ton per mile. During the dry season, May to October, the Government Roadtrain was used to supply remote communities and isolated cattle stations in the Victoria River, Wave Hill and Borroloola regions. During the wet season, November to April, the Government Roadtrain was used in central Australia, carting supplies to goldfields, cattle, windmills, boring equipment and supplies to remote cattle stations, wool from remote sheep stations and building material to outlying communities. In Australia an additional two trailers were built for the Government Roadtrain and in government service it covered over carrying loads of up to (well beyond the original design specifications) before it was sold off to a timber dealer in 1946. The Australian Government Roadtrain is believed to be the only surviving example and is located at the National Road Transport Hall of Fame in Alice Springs. Russian units Overseas Roadtrain bound for Russia, with specialised trailers. A third and probably a fourth AEC Roadtrain were sent to the Soviet Union in 1935. The Russian units were delivered with three trailers each with a gross vehicle weight of and a load carrying capacity , one of the trailers delivered to the Soviet Unition was fitted with a hopper for the carriage of grain, another was fitted with a fuel tank of capacity. After trials were completed, they were used to carry heavy tools, stores and equipment to the Ural Mountains throughout World War Two. There is some speculation that one of the Soviet units was later sent to Tanganyika.

It is the band's only album to feature founding guitarist Kaiser Kuo, a Chinese-American responsible for shaping the band's early direction. The album's release followed an extended period of turmoil within the band.  Background  Formed in 1989, Tang Dynasty rose to international fame with their 1992 self- titled debut album, released on Taiwanese record label Magic Stone Records. Considered to be the \\"[first real embodiment]...[of] what many Chinese young people imagined a 'real' rock band should be\\", Tang Dynasty sold an upwards of 900,000 official copies worldwide. The band was slated for a follow-up release in 1995. By then, however, frontman Ding Wu and bassist Zhang Ju had developed serious heroin addictions, which hampered productivity. On May 11, 1995, Zhang was killed in a motorcycle accident. Tang Dynasty quickly recruited ex- Breathing bassist Gu Zhong as a temporary member in July to fulfill several live appearances, but halted all other activities as the surviving members were too affected by Zhang's death to continue writing and rehearsing. The group later split with Magic Stone Records, claiming the label had not supported them through hard times. Following Zhang's death, Ding reached out to founding guitarist Kaiser Kuo, inviting him to rejoin Tang Dynasty. Kuo, who was attending graduate school at the time, returned to China in June 1996. The surviving members of Tang Dynasty had been working on a tribute album entitled Goodbye Zhang Ju (). Reunited with his former bandmates, Kuo contributed the song \\"Your Vision\\" to the project. Goodbye Zhang Ju was released in July 1997. Although Kuo initially did not want to rejoin the group, it became clear that Tang Dynasty would not be able to go on without his intervention. In August 1996, lead guitarist Liu Yijun quit the band over musical differences. Kuo stepped in the following month, Gu Zhong was made a permanent member, and Ding Wu finally kicked his addiction. Tang Dynasty played their comeback show at the Keep in Touch Bar in Beijing on July 12, 1997. They were managed by Hong Kong industry veteran Dickson Dee for a short time before signing to Beijing-based label Jingwen Records in 1998. Kuo described 1997 and 1998 as \\"some of the happiest years of my life\\".  Composition, themes, and recording  Epic is significantly more prog-oriented than its predecessor. The album features lengthier songs, less surrealistic lyricism, and emphasizes technicality over intensity. The band retained some of its folk influences, notably demonstrated on the title track, which features a guzheng-dominated interlude. In a 1995 interview compiled on Goodbye Zhang Ju, founding bassist Zhang Ju revealed that Tang Dynasty had written all the material for a second album and were slated to go into the studio in May. Kaiser Kuo disputes this, claiming that Tang Dynasty were \\"utterly unproductive\\" between 1992 and 1996, and called the music written in his absence \\"completely unlistenable\\". With Kuo now on lead guitar, Tang Dynasty effectively rewrote their second album, retaining a few ideas the guitarist deemed usable. Of these ideas, \\"The Visitor\\" remained largely unchanged, as shown by a live recording dating back to May 1994. The band rerecorded \\"Your Vision\\" for Epic. The song features Kuo on lead vocals and is the only song in Tang Dynasty's catalog with English lyrics. Kuo likened his friendship with Ding Wu and Zhang Ju to the brotherhood of Guan Yu, Liu Bei, and Zhang Fei. The song's lyrics were based on a dream Zhang Ju had about the trio remaining friends into old age, reminiscing about old days while watching their grandchildren play. The song \\"Farewell\\" was originally written by Chinese polymath Li Shutong. Like their previous album, a cover song was featured as the album's closer. The band describes Epic as \\"a reflection of the modern interpretation of history and the self-reflection of the journey of life\\". In keeping with Kuo's original vision of the band, the album is heavily influenced by Chinese martial philosophies. The album title itself, Epic (Êºî‰πâ or Y«ény√¨ in Chinese), is a direct reference to the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (‰∏âÂõΩÊºî‰πâ). The title track draws lyrics from key lines in the book, identifying with the heroes of the past and speaks of the duties of a hero. The other members had been exploring Buddhist concepts prior to Kuo's return, which they subsequently incorporated on Epic. Kuo believed this gave the band's music a \\"kind of Zeppelin-esque mysticism\\". The album was produced by Otomo Koetsu, a Japanese producer based in Beijing. Otomo had previously worked for JVC Entertainment, and had produced Black Panther's Nothing Is Nothing. According to Kuo, the recording process was \\"very indie\\". Instead of sending off the finished mixes to be mastered separately, the band opted to master the album themselves, but botched the process. The result was a flat-sounding record at very low volume, which subsequently had to be remixed and remastered for release in Taiwan.  Tracklisting  The Taiwanese edition includes two additional live tracks.  Reception  Epic sold around 400,000 copies, with about 80,000 cassette copies alone sold in Beijing within the first five days of its release. \\"Time at My Heels\\", the first single off the album, became a Top 10 hit. Tang Dynasty toured intensively leading up to and following the album's release, headlining and selling out concerts throughout China. The reception of the album by the media and the audience, however, was lukewarm, and the album failed to re-established the popularity of the band. Some fans were dissatisfied with Kaiser Kuo's guitar playing, viewing it as poor and even too \\"American\\" in comparison to Liu Yijun's virtuosic technique. Kuo himself believed the album's subpar production negatively affected the music, but \\"[stood] by a lot of the songwriting\\". On March 1, 2000, the opening track \\"Epic\\" was released on an EP, containing six versions of the song including an abridged version, a demo version, and a live version. Kuo's tenure in Tang Dynasty would not last long. The guitarist left the band in May 1999 following an argument with Ding Wu over the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Kuo also cited frequent clashes with Ding's then-girlfriend in what he called a \\"Yoko Ono situation\\" as another impetus to quit. He was briefly replaced by Iron Kite frontman Yu Yang, who would in turn be replaced by guitarist Chen Lei. Kuo would go on to establish a folk metal band called Spring and Autumn (), which released one album in 2006.

It was designed in various stages by J. Bibb, H. C. Kent and Kent & Massie and was built from 1856 to 1859. It is also known as Mission to Seamen; Rawson Institute for Seamen & Mariners' Church; Craft Centre. The property is owned by Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. The building was previously a cafe, place of worship and craft centre.  History  The site is one of the most historic in Australia. The first occupant was Lieutenant Ball of the First Fleet vessel in 1788, and after the waterfront part of the Hospital site to the south was set aside as a Dockyard, Thomas Moore, the Master Boat Builder, built a house where Ball's house and garden had been. The neighbouring land to the north was first owned by William Balmain, but by 1800 had passed to Robert Campbell. The Bethel Union originated in England, in the Port of London. Its founding was part of the widespread evangelical religious revival of the early 19th century, of which missionary activity among seamen was becoming a part. In 1822, the Bethel Seamen's Union or Bethel Union was established in Sydney. Two earlier sites were granted to the Union, one at Darling Harbour near Erskine Street where a church was erected in 1844, the second at south east Circular Quay where the church operated out of a temporary building for 6 years, before the third site, the former Master Boat Builder's house site at West Circular Quay, was granted in 1856 following representations from the Union for a site in this area, the centre of maritime activity in Sydney. The Bethel Union's third church was designed by John Bibb, in the Victorian Free Classical style, built of well-executed sandstone ashlar, with a slate roof. Construction continued throughout 1856 & 1857\\\\. Then work stopped through lack of funds. During construction, the stonemasons union advised of the reduction of their working hours per day from 12 to 8. This was agreed by the Bethel Union Trustees and thus the site was the first to employ stonemasons on an 8-hour day in Sydney. On 27 February 1859 the Mariners' Church was opened. The building is of high architectural and historical importance, and the original church is a grand space and a rare and precious reminder of an expansive early Victorian preaching auditorium. Early attendance was low, but after Rev. Thomas Gainsford took office in 1871, attendance soared, and in 1873 more accommodation was provided by the excavation of some of sandstone to create a basement providing a hall for concerts and dining, a smoking room, and a library. In 1888, the basement was enlarged, a smoking room added to the library, and a gymnasium created. Around this time the Bethel Union was in financial difficulties, and eventually, in 1895, the Mariners' Church was leased to the Missions to Seamen, an organisation originating in England in 1835, and starting in Sydney with the work of John Shearston in 1872. In his missionary work for neglected seamen he initially provided church services but was soon providing for their wider needs, including reading rooms and clubs, education and welfare services. The two organisations combined functions and prospered, The facilities were considered inadequate, and the Governor, Sir Harry Rawson instigated extensions which were carried out in 1910, and the complex was renamed The Rawson Institute for Seamen. The alterations were designed by William Kent in Federation Free Classical style. The closure of Bethel Street and the creation of the Bethel Steps to replace it enabled a larger site. An extra storey was added with four columns to support the beam structure of the upper floor which consisted of a central chapel with compartments on either side. Kent added rooms to the George Street facade which were in the Federation Free Classical style, converting the fa√ßade into a three-storey ensemble. The south front rooms curved around the boundary of the Bethel Steps. The activities of the Institute continued to expand and Dame Margaret Davidson, wife of the new Governor, launched an appeal for the further enlargement of 1927-28 called the Dame Margaret Davidson Wing designed by the architects Kent and Massie. In 1931 the Bethel Union Trustees approved an extension of the lease to the end of 1960, and a new dwelling for the Mission Chaplain was built. In 1971 the Mariners' Church complex was resumed by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) and the Bethel Union was relocated to Flying Angel House, 11-15 Macquarie Place, opened in 1977. The SCRA then adapted the building for the Craft Council of NSW which operated from 1981-1990 when the building was vacated to make way for The Story of Sydney, and the Craft Centre moved to No 88 George Street. The Story of Sydney opened in January 1991 and closed on 31 January 1992, as it proved not to be a financially viable project. The Mariners' Church building was being used as an art gallery and cafe, the gallery moved out in 2006. Currently the building is being completely renovated and stonework restored for fitting out as a restaurant and nightclub. Part of these works were excavation into the 1909 extension to fit plant into a basement. This exposed the top courses of a retaining wall and Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority archaeologists were called in to excavate. The almost complete remains of Bethel St were uncovered in the new basement. A viewing window was cut into the wall at Bethel Stairs and interpretation of Bethel St and the building is to be installed. The Mariners Church was originally built in 1854, extended in 1873, 1908-9, 1921 and 1927. The site had previously been that of the boat builders house and garden, part of the Government Boatyard which also encompassed Cadmans Cottage to the south.  Description  The first John Bibb structure was built in Victorian Free Classical style in temple form, resulting in a single large prismatic volume with two projecting wings with a cruciform plan symmetrical about two axes. The elevations have a high piano nobile (main floor) four pediments and carved foliated decoration. The 1909 alterations were designed by Harry Chambers Kent in Federation Free Classical style. The closure of Bethel Street and the creation of the Bethel Steps to replace it enabled a larger site. An extra storey was added with four columns to support the beam structure of the upper floor which consisted of a central chapel with compartments on either side. Kent added rooms to the George Street facade which were in the Federation Free Classical style, converting the facade into a three-storey ensemble. The south front rooms curved around the boundary of the Bethel Steps. In 1927 a new chapel was built in the Inter-War Mediterranean or Romanesque style at ground level and a new balcony was erected on a base of retaining walls and piers of cement rendered load bearing brickwork facing Circular Quay West. In 1931 a stone cottage erected 30 years before on the north-east corner of the site was demolished and a new dwelling for the Mission Chaplain was built, designed by N. W. McPherson, which became part of the Davidson Wing, and was not completed until after World War II. The Circular Quay facade had become asymmetrical and idiosyncratic, and concealed almost all of the original Bibb building. In 1980-81 work undertaken on the building to adapt it for the Craft Council included the demolition of the 1931 Chaplaincy addition and part of the 1927-28 addition. A staircase and office were added, and the ground floor chapel became the Craft Centre, the basement a gallery. The treatment of the three chapels was sympathetic but some adverse work including a new mezzanine in the 1909 chapel were added. In 1990, the work, consisting of some conservation and careful adaptation work, undertaken for the Story of Sydney, was in general benign. The exteriors were improved, and a terrace was added which improved the West Circular Quay facade. The church was architecturally styled in 1856 in the Victorian Free Classical; in 1909 in the Federation Free Classical; and in 1927 in the Inter-War Mediterranean or Romanesque. The church has three storeys, a galvanised iron roof; and flooring that comprises terracotta tiles, concrete and bituminous felt. In 2008 a complete refurbishement of the building was undertaken, this included replacement of degraded stonework and excavation under the 1909 extension. This excavation revealed the almost complete remains of Bethel St and included a large retaining wall.  Condition  As at 3 May 2001, Archaeological Assessment Condition: Watching brief- mostly disturbed. Assessment Basis: In general it was concluded that although sub-floor deposits had been grossly disturbed by the various post-1854 building phases, the back section of the building, incorporating the Margaret Davidson Wing, contained potentially useful data at the former inter-tidal zone, some 3 metres below the current surface. Investigation: Watching brief Archaeology: watching brief- partly disturbed. 2008 excavation for liftwell and under the 1910 extension which revealed an almost complete Bethel St  Modifications and dates  1873; 1909; 1927; 1931; 1940; 1947 (for detailed information see the Conservation Plan & above in description). 2008 complete refurbishment  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, The Mariners' Church and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The former Mariners' Church occupies an historic site and itself has association with the Age of Victorian enlightenment, reflected in the establishment of the Bethel Union and Rawson Institute for Seamen, and in changes in approaches to the welfare of seamen evidenced by the building fabric. The evolving complex is also associated with a number of prominent individuals including Lancelot Threlkeld, Governor Sir Henry Rawson, Sir James Fairfax, Dame Margaret Davidson and the architects John Bibb and Harry C. Kent and his partners. The existing Mariners' Church complex is an important streetscape element in a major historic precinct and its buildings display characteristics of the highest aesthetic calibre, including fine details and use of two applications of the Free Classical style - one early Victorian, the other Federation. The fabric of the Mariners' Church evidences high quality workmanship and early use of steel technology and illustrates subsequent application of conservation values and principles. The site is also significant in the industrial relations history of NSW as it was the first site to be awarded an eight-hour day for stonemasons, the first tradsmen to be granted it. Mariners' Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site is highly significant for its historical and occupational associations with The Rocks and the maritime nature of Sydney, including the early Dockyard and Robert Campbell's house and waterside warehouse. The present physical relationship of the group of buildings including the Mariners' Church/Rawson Institute, the ASN Building, the Sailor's Home and Cadman's Cottage, evokes this history. The building is one of the symbols of early Victorian enlightenment in The Rocks. The original Chapel represented the impact of religion and welfare in the lives of visiting seamen. It is important in the history of architecture in Australia, and provides evidence of the choice of Classical styles for non conformist Protestant church buildings. The original building signifies the impact of the Bethel Union, while the Rawson Institute demonstrates that of the Missions to Seamen. The adjoining Bethel Steps is the successor to the earlier Bethel Street. The original building and the George Street fa√ßade and other exteriors are important examples of the work of the significant architects John Bibb (early to mid 19th century) and Harry C. Kent (Federation period) respectively. The complex is important for its association with many people of historical importance. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The evolving complex is also associated with a number of prominent individuals including Lancelot Threlkeld, Governor Sir Henry Rawson, Sir James Fairfax, Dame Margaret Davidson and the architects John Bibb and Harry C. Kent and his partners. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The former Mariners' Church is a fine early example of the Victorian Free Classical style of architecture in the form, space and surviving detail of the first chapel. The extensions completed in 1909 are a good and representative example of Federation Free Classical architecture, and are an ingenious solution to a difficult design problem. The exteriors, in particular the George St. facade, illustrate many of the essentials of that style. The 1909 and 1927 Chapels are finely detailed interiors, the first with an interesting Baroque quality, the second an Inter-War Mediterranean or Romanesque style. It forms an effective streetscape component of George Street North, and Circular Quay West, with the corner curve into Bethel Steps, which forms another important streetscape element. The building occupies a key location at the confluence of Hickson Road and George Street and has a landmark quality being at the crown of a slight rise, providing a focus for a variety of spatial vistas and even different levels of views. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building characterises and illustrates in its present fabric the changes in approaches to welfare among seamen, from the mainly religious endeavours expressed in the first Chapel to the more diverse recreational and educational approaches expressed in the progressively enlarged complex. The construction of the building is associated with the first application in Sydney of the principle of the eight-hour working day and thus with the early influence of the trade union movement. Its resumption and adaptation by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority for use as a Craft Centre and later adaptations for the Story of Sydney and then for gallery shop and cafe uses represent a continuation of a semi-public uses and the application of 1970s, 1980s and 1990s conservation values. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The first Mariners' Church is a good example of traditional masonry construction, displaying fine workmanship and detailing, including different kinds of ashlar tooling as well as the use of shell-lime mortar. The early use of imported iron windows adds to its technical interest. The insertion of the basement (now level 2) some years after the completion of the Mariners' Church was a bold enlargement of the available space of the building. The interpolation of riveted steel structural members in 1908-09 is a fairly early example of this type of structure. The ensembles of pressed metal ceilings are significant for their size, consistency and intactness. The eastern portion of the site is known to contain archaeological deposits with potential to yield information about the use of this site and of the history of The Rocks.

Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The oldest rocks exposed at the surface in Iraq are part of the Cambrian and Ordovician age Khabour Quartzite Formation. Very little research and as of 1997 no boreholes have managed to reach underlying Precambrian rock. Most likely deeper basement rocks are part of the Afro- Arabian Plate formed into a craton in the Proterozoic. Northeastern Iraq has a thinned quasicontinental crust due to Neo-Tethys extensional faulting and plastic deformation of rocks. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) In the Paleozoic, the Arabian Plate was an extension of the African Plate and a part of Gondwana oriented to Paleo-Tethys Ocean to the north. Grabens formed, accumulating thicker sediments although sedimentary rocks overall ranged up to four kilometers thick. Drilling in the Western Desert penetrated the Khabour Quartzite Formation down 1.67 kilometers without leading to depth estimates in grabens of three kilometers. In the late Silurian, deposition paused twice due to the Caledonian orogeny and the Hercynian orogeny resulted in a deposition break in the Carboniferous and Permian. The Khabour Quartzite is overlain by the Akkaz Formation. The Pirispiki Red Beds and Chalki Volcanics from the Devonian are related to the global Kaskaskia marine transgression event, along with the Ora Shale and a sequence of limestone formations. The Ga'ara Formation and the Chia Zairi Limestone Formation deposited in the Permian. Chia Zairi rocks are particularly thick‚Äîup to 800 meters‚Äîand include the 61 meter Satina Evaporite Member, interpreted as the beginning of splitting of the Arabian Plate into the Anatolian Plate and Iranian Plate. The Harur Limestone Formation in the Early Carboniferous marked a significant change in deposition that persisted into the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Limestone, marl, evaporite and shale became the dominant rocks in northern Iraq while a mix of clastic and calcareous rocks was more typical in the south. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) In the Mesozoic, the Anatolian and Iranian plates fully separated and the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened. The Mesopotamian Zone (also known as the Mesopotamian Foredeep) and central Iraq had particularly thick sedimentary sequences. North-south axes are common in flexures in these rocks. In the Zone of Foreland Folding, rocks show signs of turbdiite and submarine fan deposits. The 24 meter Beduh Shale Formation deposited in the Werfenian, overlying the 200 meter Mirga Mir Limestone. It is overlain by the Anisian and Ladinian age Geli Khana Formation up to 575 meters thick. These units deposited owing to rapid subsidence with the pull-apart of the crust and separation of the Iranian Plate. The 36 meter Baluti Shale Formation formed in the Rhaetic, overlain by the 834 meter Carnian-Norian Kurrah Chine Formation and Liassic 303 meter Sarki Formation. Further to the south, lagoon conditions formed the Butmah Formation, Adaiyah Anhydrite, Mus Limestone, Alan Anhydrite and Sargelu Formation. The Najmah and Gotnia formations emplaced during the Callovian and Tithonian. Through the Jurassic, the Nahr Umr, Mauddud, Rutba and Msad formations accumulated in what is now the Western Desert. The Foreland Folds Belt foreland basin accumulated calcareous material and argillite, including the 762 meter Balambo Formation. In the Cretaceous, ophiolite obducted as the Penjwin-Shlair Complex, the Qulqula Radiolarites and the Khwakurk Series volcanics as the foreland basin witnessed 270 meters of sediment deposition. The Katarash volcanic rocks are indicative of uplift and mantle convection back-arc spreading. The Red Beds Series piled up near the subduction zone, where the Neo-Tethys Ocean crust was being subducted and consumed beneath the Anatolian and Iranian Plates. The Naopurdan Group, Gimo- Qandil Group and Walash Volcanics formed in forearc and back-arc environments. Kolosh and Tanjero formation clastic rocks are from flysch sediments in the Neo-Tethys Ocean that remained on the Arabian Plate continental margin. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Combined Maastrichtian and Paleocene sediments range from as little as 100 meters to as much as 2.79 kilometers. During the Eocene, the Arabian Plate began to underride the Anatolian and Iranian Plate as the Neo-Tethys Ocean fully closed. Shallow seas and lagoons dominated the landscape, with periodic evaporite deposition such as the Gercus Formation. Other locations accumulated continental red beds. The Kirkuk Group, which hosts the large Kirk oil field, deposited during these transgression-regression cycles in the Oligocene. The Jeribe and Serikagni formations and the Dhiban Anhydrite mark continued transgressions into the Miocene. The Fatha and Ghar formations appeared in the Middle Miocene, with recurring lagoon conditions, before the Injana Formation foreland basin marked the end of marine deposition. The Mukdadiyah and Bai Hassan formations include 2.5 kilometers of conglomerate formed during the Alpine orogeny (the combined 354 meter Dibdibba and Zahra formations emplaced on the quasiplatform). Basement faulting was typical of the orogeny period as the Zagros Mountains began to form. References Iraq ","title":"Geology of Iraq"},{"id":"58945776","text":"Latcham is a surname.

It was the first recovery center in the US founded on the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  History  High Watch Recovery Center is a seventy-eight-bed treatment center which began in 1939 as High Watch Farm. It is the oldest such facility based on the program of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the only such center founded by Bill Wilson, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. The farm was previously called Joy Farm since 1926 and had been the site of a residential community of spiritual seekers. These seekers were followers of a teacher named Emma Curtis Hopkins who was renowned in her time and boasted a following of 50,000 students. Hopkins, known as ‚ÄúThe Teacher of Teachers,‚Äù was one of the major founders of the New Thought movement that today still informs such major churches as Unity Church. In 1939 the farm was bought and was operated by a philanthropist and heiress from the Winthrop and Stuyvesant families, Etheldred F. Folsom, who was a devotee of Hopkins. She continued to utilize the farm as a spiritual retreat center where she disseminated Hopkins' teachings under \\"The Ministry of the High Watch\\". Folsom preferred to be known as Sister Francis in the manner of the Quakers and in honor of her favorite saint, Saint Francis of Assisi. High Watch Recovery Center was founded that year when Folsom met Marty Mann and Bill Wilson, who had recently founded Alcoholics Anonymous. Marty Mann Bill Wilson, his wife Lois, and other friends drove to Kent, CT to meet Sister Francis at Joy Farm in the fall of 1939. It was a historic weekend, ending in Sister Francis asking Bill W. to take over the farm because she felt his program aligned with her beliefs and he could find more success with alcoholics than she had. Mann later said of her first encounter with High Watch Farm, \\"There was something there, something that was really palpable that you could feel, and every one of us felt it. To say that we fell in love with it is not to use the right terminology at all. We were engulfed... What is at the Farm was at the Farm before we ever found it. It found us, in my opinion.\\" Marty Mann was an early ally of Bill W.‚Äôs in founding AA, often thought of as the third co-founder. The earliest and most significant friend of High Watch Farm, she had her own cabin there, and for a year her mother ran the Farm. Her speech at the 25th Anniversary of High Watch is notable for her description of the historic meeting of Bill W. and Sister Francis. A celebrated speaker, Mann was Bill W.‚Äôs chosen replacement on the speaker‚Äôs platform when he was too ill to appear. In later years, Ebby Thacher, the man Bill Wilson would refer to as \\"my sponsor\\", would be a guest at High Watch. The High Watch board, with its new AA members, were startled awake in July, 1941, when Sister Francis, board president, declared herself physically incapable of setting foot on her own land and Marty Mann abruptly resigned her secretary position on the board. ‚ÄúThe vision is lost,‚Äù Sister Francis mourned. It turned out that a psychologist, a recovering alcoholic, had been put in place as director of the new High Watch Farm. Though he agreed to operate ‚Äúin full collaboration with AA,‚Äù he later decided that only what he alone had to offer would work. Alerted by Marty and Sister Francis, Bill W. wrote to the director about this ‚Äúimpasse‚Äù in a strong, mediating letter. Not long after, the director resigned peacefully, and Sister Francis, Marty Mann and Alcoholics Anonymous returned to High Watch Farm. AA is constantly evaluated by scholars and historians, who consider this historic 1941 fight for the return of Alcoholics Anonymous to High Watch Farm to be one of the major ‚Äútests‚Äù that foreshadowed AA's future success. This marks High Watch's status as a landmark site in the history of AA. High Watch is listed in the compendium of \\"Places and Things in AA History\\". Clinical care The High Watch program of addiction recovery addresses the neurobiology of addiction and co-occurring disorders (such as depression, anxiety or bi-polar disorder) and residents receive individual bio-psycho-social evaluation. Once identified, biological interventions to repair brain neural and neurotransmitter systems damaged by addiction are integrated into the individual's Twelve Step recovery program. A new facility was opened in October 2012 with Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman and then-Board member Susan St. James in attendance to cut the ribbon. In November 2016, High Watch opened a new facility called the Treatment Living Center. The building houses thirty- eight guests and, according to High Watch, \\"allows High Watch to offer a more advanced, wide range of care.\\" High Watch was included in Psychology Today's 2012 \\"Best Treatment Guide: The Referral Guide for Professionals.\\"  References  Category:Alcoholics Anonymous Category:1940 establishments in Connecticut Category:Drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers Category:Drug rehabilitation Category:Alcohol and health Category:Medical and health organizations based in the United States ","title":"High Watch Recovery Center"},{"id":"58945970","text":"Maeno (written: ÂâçÈáé) is a Japanese surname.

The episode was dedicated to Rick and Morty and former Simpsons producer J. Michael Mendel who died of natural causes on September 24, 2019, five days before the season premiere. Plot At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer, Lenny and Carl are watching Anger Watkins's sports commentary show when he asks who's better, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, or Michael Jordan. When Homer calls the show and says John Stockton, Watkins insults Homer. Angry, Homer takes Marge's advice and starts his own internet sports show. Bart interrupts the taping of Homer's show, causing the two of them to begin brawling. Their video goes viral on the internet and a hipster named Warburton Parker tells them he's going to teach them how to make better videos and become rich: monetizing. Their next video fight, sponsored by Buzz Cola, gets over 25 million views. Making videos brings Homer and Bart closer. When they are filmed hugging each other, however, their popularity disappears. Parker attempts to organize a comeback where Bart and Homer would fight to the death, but they refuse at the last minute, ending their internet fame.

The album didn't chart but the single \\"Glad It's All Over\\" reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The album features contributions from producer Tony Mansfield, Robyn Hitchcock, Ruts drummer Dave Ruffy and the band Dolly Mixture, among others. The Power of Love was reissued on CD in 2009 by Cherry Red Records, including seven bonus tracks. For the reissue the track listing was re-sequenced, as Captain Sensible was never happy with the original running order.  Background  As on his first solo album, Women and Captains First, Sensible had enlisted ex-Soft Boy Robyn Hitchcock to help with the songwriting on The Power of Love. \\"He was writing some spectacular lyrics for my tunes\\", Sensible explained. According to Hitchcock, \\"[Sensible] had a lot of backing tracks and he just gave me some cassettes and then I went away and wrote some words.\\" The anti-war song \\"Glad It's All Over\\" was Sensible's pointed comment on the Falklands war. He described the song as \\"a result of my highly tuned pop sensibilities and the aural sculpting genius of producer Tony Mansfield... who actually plays the drum parts live himself on (not sampled!) a Duckhams oil can (floor tom), a casserole dish lid (high hat) and a Rowntrees choc tin (snare drum). After a bit of 'tuning' with a panel hammer the kit sounded just right and we rolled the tape with the result transforming the song into something rather special.\\" On the album's title, Sensible said: \\"With the Falklands war [in 1982] and the mass build up of nuclear missiles in my mind I thought the planet could do with a bit more love and a bit less unpleasantness. So me and my neighbour Bob wrote a song called \\"The Power of Love\\" which also ended up as the album title.\\" Album track \\"Thanks for the Night\\" would be rerecorded by The Damned and released as a single in 1984.  Critical reception  In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mark Deming wrote that on The Power of Love, the playful side that made many of the songs on Sensible's first solo album so appealing, \\"fell by the wayside, and instead the album was a straightforward and overly slick exercise in electro-processed pop ... with Tony Mansfield's production so slick and clean you could fry an egg on it.\\" Deming felt that \\"Royal Rave Up\\" is the only song on the album that shows the funny side of Sensible and that \\"while a few of the songs are quite good ... the most effective bit of whimsy comes from a cover of the Pink Floyd rarity \\"It Would Be So Nice\\". Deming concluded that \\"while dance beats dominate a number of these tracks, the cumulative effect falls somewhere between languid and simply lazy\\", adding that The Power of Love robs Sensible's music of \\"much of its charm and personality\\".

He is best known for his work portraiture work, especially paintings of Scottish writers Hugh MacDiarmid and Compton Mackenzie.  Early life  He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, where he was Dux (or highest achieving pupil) in drawing for 1922. He went on to train at Edinburgh College of Art, receiving a postgraduate Andrew Grant fellowship. Westwater married and later divorced Scottish architect Emily Lind Maclennan (1908-1996).  Career  After graduating from Edinburgh College of Art, Westwater underwent a period of travel and further study on the continent. He then returned to Edinburgh, spending ten years teaching at the College of Art. During that time, he taught Composition and Drawing from 1933 to 1934 and Life Drawing History from 1937 to 1943. In 1936, Westwater ventured for the first time into large scale mural work with the Wardie School mural Alice in Wonderland, which was commissioned under the 'Schools Beautiful' scheme led by the Edinburgh Education Committee and Edinburgh College of Art. In 1937, he took part in the Glasgow Empire Exhibition, where he contributed a mural to Basil Spense's Imperial Chemical Industries [ICI] pavilion. Following this, he also created a mural for the Musselburgh Wire Mills in 1939 in the workers' lecture hall. Westwater later moved to London where he established himself as a full-time artist. He was noted for his work as a portraitist, among his notable subjects were the Scottish writers Hugh MacDiarmid and Compton Mackenzie.  Controversy over mural at Wardie Primary School, Edinburgh  In 2013, following a Heritage Lottery-funded restoration, one of the panels of the Alice in Wonderland mural at Wardie school was the subject of a Police Scotland investigation, after a parent complained over the purportedly racist content of this image. Despite calls to have the golliwog removed or painted over in the mural, the school and Edinburgh City Council maintained that the mural would remain untouched. A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council was quoted in an article in the Guardian, saying: \\"The mural is of both historical and artistic importance. While we understand the offensiveness of the image, it is in no way indicative of the attitudes of either the school or the council. Our equalities policies and approaches are robustly multicultural and anti-racist, promoting diversity and good relationships among pupils.\\" Jeremy Howard, from the University of St Andrews and representing the Decorated School project, funded to study art and school buildings by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, also backed that decision. He stated in the same article: \\"This is history: if you start painting it out or get rid of it you're deceiving people about what views were prevalent in the 1930s.\\" Wardie school now plan on using the golliwog illustration as an addition to their teaching packs from Show Racism the Red Card.

Lovat was with the king at Linlithgow Palace in June 1595.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 619. In April 1596 he married Jean Stewart, daughter of James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune and Margaret Campbell, who was a lady in waiting to Anne of Denmark. As a wedding gift James VI of Scotland gave her two expensive velvet gowns, one purple and one black with gold passementerie.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), p. 148. Jean Stewart also had valuable rights over the possessions of several forfeited members of the Gordon family who had killed her brother James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray at Donibristle in 1592.National Archives of Scotland, Privy Seal Register, PS1/70 f.125. Jean Stewart shared this gift with her sister Margaret, who was betrothed to John, Master of Orkney. According to the 17th-century family historian, James Fraser, James VI had offered Lovat the pick of the ladies at court to marry. At first his choice Jean Stewart refused him saying, \\"Sir, he is not bonny.\\" James VI and Anna of Denmark pointed out the compensatory value of his lands of Lovat and Beauly. James Fraser says the wedding was at Falkland Palace followed by a sumptuous and extravagant \\"in-fare\\" at Beauly. He noted that after bearing six children Jean Stewart was overweight \\"turning gross and too fat\\" and had no more, which he said was characteristic of the Stewarts of Doune.William Mackay, Fraser Chronicles (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 223-5.

Plot The Danno Organization, Japan's largest yakuza family, expands outward from its base in Osaka during the post-war period under the leadership of Danno, the boss, and Chief Executive Tsubaki, the family's finest operative. In Yokohama, the boss of the Hamanaka Family pledges fealty to the Danno Family. In order to ward off Danno's progress, the yakuza families in Tokyo form the Tokyo Alliance with Yato as its head and use the Sakurada Family, the dominant family in Yokohama, to attack the Hamanaka Family in a proxy war between the yakuza in the west and east of Japan. Hamanaka's right-hand man Tsukamoto Tetsuo is released after spending eight years in prison, during which time his wife has committed suicide. Shortly thereafter, the boss of the Hamanaka family is blown up by dynamite thrown by members of the Sakurada family. With his dying words he passes control of the gang to Tsukamoto, saying that he regrets siding with the Danno Organization and asking Tsukamoto to stand against the Danno and make things right. The funeral is attended by Yato, boss of the Tokyo Alliance, and Danno himself from Osaka. Kamiyama, the retired boss of the Hamanaka, offers to help Tsukamoto if he needs it. Tsukamoto wishes to call a truce with the Sakurada family and break ties with the Danno Organization but knows that his men demand retribution for the murder of their boss so he resolves to kill Sakurada that night. Leading Hamanaka member Kazama is unwilling to let Tsukamoto return to jail after just getting out so he murders Sakurada instead and dies from his wounds when he returns to Tsukamoto. Tsubaki tries to convince Tsukamoto to remain with the Danno Organization and Danno himself warns Tsukamoto that he could wind up dead in the gutter. Meanwhile, Kazama's sister is left with no one in her life so Tsukamoto offers to help her if she ever needs it. The Hokuryu Kai, led by its drug addict boss Miyahara, was working for the Tokyo Alliance but has lost favor with them by flaunting formalities and is convinced by Tsubaki to change alliances and replace Hamanaka as the proxy for Danno in the war for Yokohama. The vicious Hokuryu gang repeatedly defeats the Sakurada family in their confrontations and take Hamanaka member Taki hostage when he tries to intervene during a disturbance at a club. Tsukamoto is told to come alone to retrieve him. Tsukamoto arrives at the club and discovers Kazama's sister working there as a singer. In a back room he finds Taki beaten and held by Miyahara and his men. Miyahara punches Tsukamoto then slices his head open with a knife but Tsukamoto refuses to fight back so the distraught Miyahara allows him to leave with Taki. Kazama's sister follows and nurses Tsukamoto while his headwound heals. They discuss that they are both alone now and become lovers. Yato uses Ooba, a man already holding a grudge against Danno after losing his organization and his left arm in Wakamatsu the previous year, to carry out an attack on Danno. Ooba finds Danno coming out of a meeting with political kingmaker Kita Bokudo at a historic Japanese house and shoots Danno in the shoulder but fails to kill him and is shot in the chest in return. An American tourist behind him is also shot. Ooba flees and is found by the Hamanaka family but Tsubaki and Danno deny any ties to him. Tsubaki discovers that the Hamanaka family is shielding Ooba when Ooba's wife is seen arriving. Ooba and his wife try to leave to start a new life but Ooba is caught by members of the Danno organization and shot dead. His wife chases after the killers and is also shot dead. When the American tourist dies from her wound, Kita Bokudo tells Danno that it is time to make peace with the Tokyo Alliance to support the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The Tokyo Alliance agrees to the truce on the condition that Danno forces the Hokuryu Kai out of Yokohama. Miyahama refuses to leave so Danno severs ties with the Hokuryu Kai. Miyahama tells his men to leave the city but he remains and makes a phone call to Tsukamoto in which he says that he wanted to become blood brothers. Members of the Tokyo Alliance shoot Miyahama dead and Tsukamoto is arrested by the police when he rushes to Miyahama's aid. The Danno Organization attacks and kills the rest of the Hamanaka at night. The police berate Tsukamoto for his involvement in the turf wars and the deaths it has caused. Kazama's sister begs Tsukamoto not to retaliate and accuses him of putting the gang before her just like her brother but Tsukamoto insists on retaliating. Tsubaki, disgusted by the truce ceremony, walks outside to take a cigarette break and notices Tsukamoto approaching. He knows that he must give the appearance of fighting so he gets close to Tsukamoto and lets himself be stabbed in order to let Tsukamoto complete his mission. Tsukamoto stabs Danno and Yato to death but lets Kita Bokudo live. One of the yakuza shoots Tsukamoto dead in retaliation, ending his story.

Release The film was released in 1969. Sometimes referred to as Japan's Violent Gangs - Boss, it was the first in a series of four Nihon boryoku-dan (Japan's Violent Gangs) films. It was followed by Nihon boryoku-dan: kumicho to shikaku (Japan's Violent Gangs - The Boss and the Killers) (1969) by Junya Sato, Nihon boryoku-dan: kumicho kuzure (Japan's Violent Gangs - Degenerate Boss) (1970) by Shin Takakuwa, and Nihon boryoku-dan: koroshi no sakazuki (Japan's Violent Gangs - Loyalty Offering) (1972) by Yasuo Furuhata. Planned sequel Fukusaku biographer Sadao Yamane stated that the Fukasaku film Sympathy for the Underdog, a film that was released a short time later in 1971 and that also stars Tsuruta and Ando, was originally developed as a sequel to Japan Organized Crime Boss until the director saw The Battle of Algiers. According to Yamane, it was then that Fukasaku decided to make a film about \\"foreigners\\" and \\"resistance groups\\" within a yakuza film.

As a result of legislation introduced by the Church Minister Carl Hermansen in 1947, the following year, together with Johanne Andersen and Ruth Vermehren, she was ordained by Bishop Hans √òllgaard in Odense Cathedral. Denmark thus became the first country in the world to have women priests. In 1948, she was appointed assistant priest in N√∏rre √Öby-Indslev parish on the island of Funan where she quickly gained popularity. In 1951 she moved to Fredens Kirke in Odense. Biography Born on 2 February 1896 in Copenhagen, Edith Marie Brenneche Petersen was the daughter of the manufacturer Heinrich Theodor Petersen (died 1864) and Ida Olivia Victoria Brenneche (died 1874). After matriculating from Vedels Kursus in 1917, she studied theology the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1927. She had hoped to become a priest but as it was not yet possible, she took on work in offices and libraries and as a teacher. She was also an active member of the Solbjerg parish council in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen. It was only in 1947 that legislation was adopted in the Folketing allowing women to be ordained as priests. In April 1948, together with Johanne Andersen and Ruth Vermehren she was ordained by the bishop of Odense. She had already been contacted by the parish council of N√∏rre Aaby where she was now appointed assistant priest. Despite a background in the Danish Inner Mission, she quickly adapted to the Grundtvigian conditions in N√∏rre Aaby. As the post of assistant priest was a temporary assignment, she began to look for other employment. In 1951, she succeeded in being invited to take up the post of chaplain at Fredens Church in Odense. Despite achieving considerable success in her new position, in the late 1950s she had an accident which caused her health to deteriorate. This led to her retirement in 1961. Edith Brenneche Petersen died in Odense on 8 September 1973. She is buried in Odense's Rising Cemetery.

Together with the Georgian Bir el Qutt inscriptions found in Judaean Desert, the graffiti inscriptions are the oldest extant Georgian inscriptions. They illustrate the early pilgrimage of Georgian Christians to the Holy Land shortly after Christianization of Iberia. Further, Werner Seibt suggests that the Georgian script could have been invented in Syro-Palestine by the expatriate Georgian monks. They might have been supported in their endeavor by their high-ranking aristocratic countrymen such as Bacurius the Iberian, a Byzantine commander in Palestine.Codo√±er, p. 138 See also *Bolnisi inscriptions *Umm Leisun inscription *Epitaph of Samuel  References  Bibliography  *Codo√±er, J.

A member of both the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Society of Watercolour Painters, Beaton was both an alumna and a senior lecturer at the Edinburgh College of Art and had her work exhibited widely across Scotland.  Early life  Beaton was born in Edinburgh and studied at the Edinburgh College of Art, graduating in 1917. After commencing her studies she briefly worked as a school mistress at Hamilton Academy. Her former pupils included one of the Glasgow Girls Mary Nicol Neill Armour, who reportedly was greatly encouraged by Beaton's support. Beaton subsequently became a member of the faculty staff at Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) in 1919, eventually becoming the Head of the Junior Department. Notable colleagues included John Maxwell who was appointed as her assistant. He later became a senior lecturer in painting and drawing at the ECA and a notable painter in what came to be known as the Edinburgh School.  Painting career  Beaton's work was exhibited widely throughout Scotland, including 102 works at the Royal Scottish Academy, as well as the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour. Between 1925 and 1964 she was a regular exhibitor with the Scottish Society of Artists and from 1928 to 1964 with the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. Beaton was elected an Associate member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1957. Beaton's early use of colour was influenced by the expressionistic style of William George Gillies who both trained and taught with her at the ECA. Like Gillies, Beaton worked in both oil and watercolour. Inspired by the jagged east coast and the scenery of Scotland, Beaton created a number of landscapes including a series based on the shoreline of Iona, the earliest of which was exhibited at the Edinburgh College of Art's second exhibition of former students.

She has been called the 'most successful free mulatto businesswoman' in the Antebellum South.Loren Schweninger: Black Property Owners in the South, 1790-1915 She was the daughter of count Pierre Enguerrand Philippe, √âcuyer de Mand√©ville, Sieur de Marigny, and his slave concubine, and the half-sister of Bernard de Marigny. She was manumitted by her father, who arranged a pla√ßage between her and Eug√®ne de Macarty. The couple had five children. Eulalie de Mand√©ville was an accomplished and successful businesswoman. From about 1795 onward, she established an import business, importing manufactured goods which she stored in New Orleans and then distributed to retail outlets through a network of slaves as far away as to Attakapas. This was very lucrative, and she invested her money in stocks, real estate and discounted banknotes, accumulating a fortune. She married Eug√®ne de Macarty shortly before his death in 1845, which was not illegal but very controversial in the South. When he died, she inherited a fortune of $12,000. The relatives of her late husband questioned his will, among them being Delphine LaLaurie, claiming that it was illegal for a white man to will more than ten percent of his assets to a coloured mistress. They further more questioned whether the personal fortune of Eulalie de Mand√©ville (at that time worth $3 million) should in fact be classified as part of the property of Eugene Macarty, because it was known that he had transferred much of his property to her prior to his death, thereby withholding their rightful inheritance.Carolyn Morrow Long, Madame Lalaurie, Mistress of the Haunted House, 2012 However, the court acknowledged the will as legal and pointed out that Eulalie de Mand√©ville was in fact very rich even before she became the heir of her spouse, because of a business activity going back half a century.

The group advocates for Second Amendment gun-rights. Background The Socialist Rifle Association was initially created as a Facebook page in 2013, as \\"something of a joke\\". As time went on, supporters decided to make it a reality, and incorporated as a limited liability company in New Mexico. On 10 October 2018, the Socialist Rifle Association Inc. was founded in Kansas under the 501(c)(4) tax code provision. On 16 October 2018, a merger agreement was agreed between the two extant SRA nonprofits. The City of Charlottesville, et al. vs. The Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia, et al. (2018) Individuals associated with an unrelated community Facebook page calling itself the SRA attended the Unite the Right rally and were subsequently sued for their involvement. In October 2018, the city of Charlottesville filed a lawsuit against twenty five groups and individuals for alleged paramilitary activity based on a recently adopted state statute. In addition to several white supremacist figures and organizations such as the Traditionalist Worker Party, League of the South and Jason Kessler, the lawsuit also listed two anti-racist groups, the original SRA group and the left-wing gun group Redneck Revolt. The original SRA Facebook page no longer exists, suggesting it has been taken down by Facebook's moderators. Natural Disaster Mutual Aid Hurricane Florence On September 15, 2018, the SRA delivered food and other supplies to the Augusta Hispanic Seventh Day Adventist Church and Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School in northern Georgia. These locations served as hurricane shelters for those fleeing Hurricane Florence. Hurricane Michael In response to the landfall of the category 5 Hurricane Michael in 2018 and the perceived inadequate response of FEMA, the SRA and the Tallahassee branches of the DSA and the PSL formed the Hurricane Michael Mutual Aid project which sought to distribute direct relief to those in need, including those who were unable to receive FEMA relief due to their undocumented status. Hurricane Dorian On August 29, 2019, the SRA began a fundraiser under the new organizational name \\"SRAid\\" for Hurricane Dorian disaster relief. On September 5, the SRA announced it had several volunteers staging equipment on the east coast in preparation for supply deliveries to under-served communities in Charleston, SC, Wilmington, NC, and the Lumbee Tribe in Robeson County, NC. Membership In July of 2019, a third of the SRA's 2,000 members identified as LGBTQ and 8 percent are transgender. The organization claimed 7,000 active members in June 2020. The SRA has 52 local chapters operating in 33 states. The organization is headed by a National Assembly consisting of elected representatives from each chapter. Ideology The SRA describes the goal of their organization as \\"to provide an alternate to the mainstream, toxic, right-wing, and non- inclusive gun culture that has dominated the firearms community for decades. We seek to provide a safe, inclusive, and left-leaning platform for talking about gun rights and self defense, free from racist and reactionary prejudices, while providing a platform for the working class to obtain the skills necessary for all aspects of community defense\\". The group describes itself as \\"working class, progressive, anarchist, socialist, communist, eco- warrior, animal liberator, anti-fascist, anti-racist, anti-capitalist, PoC, LGBTQ-plus\\". Points of Unity Membership of the SRA is predicated on the acceptance of particular points of unity: *We are working class and poor people dedicated to educating our class in the safe use of firearms for personal and community self-defense as well as recreation and subsistence hunting. *We are a multi-tendency association of Social democrats, Communists, and Anarchists united by class, for our class. We respect one another's political stances and differences, especially when we disagree. *We are dedicated to Liberation and Freedom of ALL people and therefore oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation. *We are party to our local communities and as such we volunteer in various ways to further the connections between leftist political radicals and the unorganized communities in which we live. We help feed, house and protect other working class and marginalized folks. *We stand against the disarmament of the working class. *We are dedicated to arming the working class, both physically and mentally.

She belonged to the most famous of the plac√©es of New Orleans alongside Eulalie de Mand√©ville and Marie Th√©r√®se Metoyer, and made a fortune on investments in dry goods, cattle, banking, slave trade and real estate business. Life She was born in 1767 in colonial Mobile, one of five children to the daughter of Pierre Rochon, a shipbuilder from a Qu√©b√©cois family (family name was Rocheron in Qu√©bec), and his mul√¢tresse slave-consort Marianne. Plac√©e Once Rosette reached a suitable age, she became the plac√©e of a Monsieur Hardy, with whom she relocated to the colony of Saint Domingue. During her sojourn there, Hardy must have died or relinquished his relationship with her; for in 1797 during the Haitian Revolution, she escaped to New Orleans, where she later became the plac√©e of Joseph Forstal and Charles Populus, both wealthy white New Orleans Creoles. Business activity Rochon came to speculate in real estate in the French Quarter; she eventually owned rental property, opened grocery stores, made loans, bought and sold mortgages, and owned and rented out (hired out) slaves. She also traveled extensively back and forth to Haiti, where her son by Hardy had become a government official in the new republic. Her social circle in New Orleans once included Marie Laveau, Jean Lafitte, and the free black contractors and real estate developers Jean-Louis Doliolle and his brother Joseph Doliolle. In particular, Rochon became one of the earliest investors in the Faubourg Marigny, acquiring her first lot from Bernard de Marigny in 1806. Bernard de Marigny, the Creole speculator, refused to sell the lots he was subdividing from his family plantation to anyone who spoke English. While this turned out to be a losing financial decision, Marigny felt more comfortable with the French-speaking, Catholic free people of color (having relatives, lovers, and even children on this side of the color line). Consequently, much of Faubourg Marigny was built by free black artisans for free people of color or for French-speaking white Creoles. Rochon remained largely illiterate, dying in 1863 at the age of 96, leaving behind an estate valued at $100,000 (today, an estate worth a million dollars).

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1976. Overview The site is located in a rice field on the western edge of the Takada Plain, near the alluvial delta of the Inada River. Within a very small area (approximately one hectare) is a group of 34 circular-shaped kofun with flattened tops. Each has a diameter of seven to ten meters. Only a few of the tombs have been found to have fukiishi. Nine of the tombs have been excavated, and were found to contain a lateral stone chamber with stone sarcophagus. The burial chambers were 4.5 meters long on average, with the longest being 8.6 meters, and had a width of 0.7 to 1.0 meter, although a few were considerably narrower. Grave goods included straight swords, daggers, jewellery (beads, magatama, glass balls, gold and silver rings) and Sue ware pottery. From these grave goods, it is estimated that these tombs were constructed in the early 7th century. The site is open to the public as an archaeological park.

Overview The road was a steep mountain trail following the Himekawa River Valley, about 120 km in length, and has been in existence since very ancient times, as evidenced by J≈çmon period jade beads and jadeite stone axes produced in the Itoigawa area found at archaeological sites in the Kant≈ç region of Japan. The road was used for the transport of salt and preserved seafood from the Sea of Japan to inland regions, and for the export of soybeans, tobacco, herbal medicines, cotton, hemp and livestock from Shinano and the Kant≈ç region. The standard method of travel was by foot, as wheeled carts were almost nonexistent and the road was too steep in most places. The route was also frequently closed due to heavy snowfall, avalanches, landslides, and flooding. Salt was a critical commodity in pre-modern Japan, and the Sengoku period warlord Uesugi Kenshin was famous for abolishing taxes and salt and allowing it to be exported to his enemy, Takada Shingen, both as a gesture of magnanimity and also to remove a possible casus belli. During the Edo period, no daimy≈ç processions used the route for sankin-k≈çtai, so no formal system of post stations with honjin were established. However, there were numerous checkpoints where domain officials examined travel permits and cargos, levied taxes and at which they were small shops whose exorbitant prices and lack of goods was a perennial complaint by travellers. After the start of the Meiji period, the opening of the Shin'etsu Main Line and the ≈åito Line railways, and later Japan National Route 147 / Japan National Route 148 eliminated the need for this road, and it fell into complete ruin. In the year 2002, a well-preserved 20-kilometer section of the original path in the city of Itoigawa was designated a National Historic Site of Japan, and an additional 10-kilometer section was added in 2007.

Some active volcanoes are located in Insular Italy. Geologic history, stratigraphy, and tectonics Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) The oldest rocks in Italy may include oceanic crust subducted during the Caledonian orogeny and 440 million year old Ordovician granites. Only detrital zircons in the Alps dates to the Precambrian. These granites are located offshore of Venice, found in the Agip Assunta well and deformed, transforming into orthogneiss during the Hercynian orogeny. Overall, Italian Paleozoic rocks commonly show evidence of the Hercynian orogeny in the Alps, Sardinia, the Apuan Alps of Tuscany, and the Peloritani mountains of Sicily and Calabria. The Hercynian orogeny produced a large thrust belt, thickened the crust and led to polyphaser metamorphism yielding rocks such as gneiss, phyllite and amphibolite. Metamorphic facies range from high-pressure kyanite to low-pressure andalusite. Phlogopite peridotite from the Ivrea zone The Western Alps at Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, the Southern Alps at Braveno, Brixen, Cima d'Asta, Doss del Sabion and the Barbagia and Gallura granites in Sardinia are all examples of Carboniferous and Permian granite pluton and batholith intrusions. Ignimbrite eruptions had an important role at the same time in forming parts of the central Southern Alps. Sedimentary rocks from before the Permian have remained intact and unmetamorphosed (or only having experienced low-grade metamorphism) in the Paleocarnian charn of the eastern Southern Alps. The metamorphic grade increases to the west, reaching amphibolite grade in the Orobic Alps and granulite grade in the Ivrea-Verbano Zone. Most of the basement rocks in the Dolomites are phyllite or gneiss at greenschist grade. Within the Dioritic- Kinzigitic unit, biotite and sillimanite-rich gneiss outcrop in Calabria. At the same time in the Permian and Carboniferous, the opening of the west branch of the Tethys Ocean reoriented sections of Italy atop the Adriatic Plate and created the Ligure-Piemontese ocean basin, leading to widespread deposition of carbonates, evaporites and red beds. Units such as the Valgardena Sandstone emplaced during a westward marine transgression in areas later uplifted as the Alps. These sandstones were succeeded by sabkha, the lagoonal Bellerophon Formation, volcanic rocks, the Werfen Formation and Servino Formation. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Glauconitic rock of Jurassic age from Lombardy Even in the 19th century, geologists recognized Ladinian and Carnian age carbonate platforms in the Dolomites that likely formed as coral atolls. Throughout the early Triassic, the Zorzino Limestone, Rhaetian Choncodon Dolomite, Riva di Solto Shale and Zu Limestone filled the Lombard Basin. Up to two kilometers of carbonates assembled in the late Triassic as the Dolomia Principale. Meanwhile, the Lagonegro Basin accumulated limestone, chert and marl into the Jurassic. Complex tectonics produced horst and graben features and some lowlands deposited evaporites, such as the Burano Anhydrite‚Äînow a significant unit in the Apennine Mountains. Jurassic tectonic conditions differed somewhat from the Triassic, resulting in new basin formation and a carbonate depositional environment akin to the current day Florida-Bahamas platform. Southern Alps basins such as the Lombard Basin and the Belluno Basin gathered marl and limestone, while turbidite and nodular limestone was more common in the Vajont Limestone, Fonzaso Formation and Selcifero Lombardo. In addition to wide shelf environments like the Bahamas, seamounts like the Trento Swell or the Sicilian Iblean and Saccense zones, some basins such as the Piemontese Basin, the Lagonegro Basin and the Ligurian-western Tuscan Ligure Basin were situated above ophiolite and ended up with abundant radiolarite fossils in limestone. During the Cretaceous, global high sea levels and local tectonic conditions produced a greater share of basins than platform environments (although the Campano-Lucana, Friuli, Apulia and Latium-Abruzzi platforms persisted). More pelagic, open water sediments like marl joined breccia and underwater debris flows. Triassic conditions persisted in only one location in Sardinia where up to one kilometer of carbonates finished depositing in the Cretaceous, atop deformed Cambrian-Carboniferous metamorphic basement rock. Changing interaction between the European Plate and the Adriatic Plate resulted in tectonic compression along the Adriatic Plate's northern margin, kicking off the formation of the Alps and the Apennines. In the late Cretaceous, foredeeps filled with flysch and molasse sediments shed off the rising mountains. Examples include the Bergamo Flysch within the Lombard Basin of the Southern Alps. The Mesozoic was largely quiescent in terms of magmatism, but some igneous activity did take place. Pietra Verde sandstones from the Ladinian in the Southern Alps contain calc-alkaline rock while granite, shoshonite and monzonite intruded the Dolomites region into the Carnian. In fact, subsurface rocks in the Po Valley, the Lagonegro Basin, west Trentino, the Venetian foothills, Sicily, Lombary and the northern Apennines show signs of volcaniclastic sediments and pillow lava from the time period. Although the oceanic crust of the Tethys Ocean has been recycled into the mantle, sections of it remain as ophiolite with peridotite, gabbro, prasinite, serpentinite and pillow lava of Jurassic to Cretaceous age in Liguria, Tuscany, Val d'Aosta and Piemonte. Petrological research indicates that ophiolites in the Alps are metamorphosed, while those in the Apennines are not. The Ragusa Basin in the Iblean Plateau of Sicily had magmatism in the Jurassic, together with the Trapanese Basin, followed by Cretaceous activity in the Syracuse area. Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present) Lecce province, southeast Italy Badlands sediments of Pliocene‚ÄìPleistocene age in Atri, Abruzzo Around 60 million years ago in the Paleocene, alkali basalt dikes penetrated areas in the Dolomites. Basalt and volcaniclastic rocks also erupted in the Lessini Mountains, together with syenite and trachyte latholiths. In the Eocene, the Apennine Mountains continued forming. The foothills in Friuli and the Venice-area are remnants of Eocene age flysch shed off the Dinaric Alps. Throughout the Paleogene, the same region witnessed both shale and carbonate formation in shallow water areas away from the Dinarides thrust belt. Paleontologists have gathered extensive fish fossils from the period out of the Bolca quarry close to Verona. Alpine uplift spurred tonalite, granodiorite, syenite and monzonite emplacement as batholiths and plutons, lasting into the Oligocene, as well as basaltic andesite intrusions. The Insubric Lineament sheared the Bregaglia batholith. Throughout the Oligocene, a subduction zone‚Äîdipping to the west‚Äîformed to the east of Sardinia, Corsica and the Alpine belt. Ionian Basin and Adriatic Plate sediments accreted onto the Apennine area as the region migrated to the northeast, spread eastward and to the south. Tectonic evolution of the Southern Alps shifted the foredeep further south, accumulating the Gonfolite Lombarda as well as the Molassa Bellunese in the Miocene. The Gessosso-Solfifera Formation contains evaporites surrounding the Apennines left by the Messinian salinity crisis. The Bracco Nappe is part of the primarily oceanic rocks of the Ligurian Basin on the western edge of the Apennines. To the east of the Ligurian Basin is the Umbro-Marigiano Basin, which contains the Tuscan Zone‚Äîa carbonate platform sequence ending in the Liassic with younger pelagic sediments. The Latium-Abruzzi Platform is to the southeast. During the Neogene, Apennine foredeeps, such as Central Apeninnic Foredeep migrated to the east into Pleistocene times with continued flysch deposition. Basins that emerged at the period include the Cervarola, Camerino, Laga, Cellino, Macigno and Marnoso-Arenacea. The Cretaceous to Miocene aged Cilento Flysch, Flysch Rosso and Frido Flysch contain shale, sandstone and conglomerate and are associated with ophiolite, offering evidence of the deformational history during that time span in the southern Apennines. The Numidian Flysch contains quartz and arenite sands likely deposited by a river delta from Africa and overlain by the coarser Goroglione Flysch. Both date to the Miocene. Uplift continues today and since the Pleistocene, Calabrian sedimentary rocks have uplifted more than one kilometer. Prior to current volcanism in southern Italy, seamount volcanoes were active in the Tyrrhenian Sea during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, as well as on-land volcanism in Tuscany and Campania (following the course of an Apennine graben). The islands of Elba, Gavorrono, Stromboli and others formed due to eruptions atop oceanic crust from nine million to 180,000 years ago. One offshore eruption in 1891 generated the short-lived island of Ferdinandea which quickly eroded below the water, remaining as the Graham Bank. Mount Etna tends toward less explosive basaltic eruptions. Natural resource geology Hematite from Rio Marina iron mine on Elba Petroleum exploration in Italy began in the late 19th century and resulted in the discovery of the Caviaga gas field close to Milan in 1944. Apennine folding has created structural traps in Pliocene sand reservoirs in the Bradanic Trough, Adriatic Sea and beneath the Po Plain. In between Brescia and Milan, the stratigraphic traps are formed at the base of Pliocene transgressive rocks and then migrated into Neogene clastic rocks that were experiencing more intense tectonic activity. In some places, organic matter in Miocene flysch may have been the original source of hydrocarbon. Off of eastern Calabria (Crotone), offshore of Trapani in western Sicily and in Gagliano, northeast Sicily are flysch-derived gas condensate reservoirs. Liassic and Triassic age carbonates and reservoirs offshore in the south Adriatic or onshore at Irpinia are hosted in Triassic dolomites. Extremely deep production more than five kilometers deep takes place east of Milan in the Malossa Field. The eastern Sicilian Gela and Ragusa oil fields are also particularly deep. In spite of extensive extraction after World War II, Italy still retains oil and gas resources. Production rose from 13.8 million cubic meters of gas in 1984 and 2.2 million tons of oil to 17.4 billion cubic meters and 4.3 million tons of oil by 1991, and new reserves were sound in Italy between 1992 and 1993. Italy has extensive lignite coal from the Eocene, concentrated in Sardinia. However, extraction is limited by thin seams and complicated tectonics. Graphite anthracite is known in Carboniferous Val d'Aosta rocks and the Permian rocks of Sardinia. Both Calabria and central Italy have peat deposits from the Paleogene. Because of the extent of mining throughout Italy's history, from Roman times to the present, many of the country's generally small mineral deposits have already been depleted. The country has small deposits of lead, sulfur, copper, zinc, silver, fluorite, barite, strontium, aluminum, gold, beryl, molybdenum, tin, uranium, iron, cobalt, chromium, titanium, mercury and astatine. Quartz, salt, feldspar, asbestos, talc, magnesite, graphite, leucite, bentonite and perlite are all extracted for industrial purposes. Historically, Italy had silver-zinc-lead mines in Monte Neve, Raibl (in the Eastern Alps), and Sardinia, mercury in north Amiata, Tuscany, fluorite and antimony in Sardinia and pyrite in Tuscany. Elba, Cogne in the Val d'Aosta valley and the Nurra Province of Sardinia all had historical iron mining. Sardinia also produced bauxite, the Western Alps asbestos and talc, Liguria and Sardinia manganese, nickel in Piemonte and copper in Val d'Aosta. Sicily remains active as a producer of sulfur and potassium salts and aluminum production has shifted into leucitic lavas in the center of the country.

As a part of the IMF, Iceland has rights in accordance with its contributions, borrowing rights which help facilitate the stability of global financial markets. Iceland‚Äôs quota is 321.8 million SDR, and its Special Drawing Rights are 112 million. This is a relatively small quota and its vote share comprises only 0.09% of all IMF vote shares, or 4,683 votes to be exact.  History of IMF - Iceland relations  Prior to 2018, Iceland did not take any loans from IMF. As of November 2018, Iceland has had 4 arrangements with the IMF. The borrowing arrangements Iceland has initiated with the IMF total 1,190% , in excess of its normal quota ( amounting to 18% of Iceland's total GDP in the year they were initiated ). This is the greatest amount the IMF has loaned a single country as a proportion of GDP. The conditionalities of Iceland's IMF programmes are based on terms as laid out in Iceland's Letter of Intent. The conditionalities include details of Banking Sector restructuring, changes to Fiscal Policy including government austerity and changes to exchange rate policies.  Iceland and the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2011)  The global financial crisis in 2007 was an economic depression when banks took major risks to invest in businesses. Other financial institutions had to give money to banks to bail them out of debts. Following the global financial crisis, Iceland's banking sector collapsed, leading to widespread unemployment. Following thereafter, three of Iceland‚Äôs major banks: Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir were unable to refinance their short term debts. The banks had liabilities in excess of 80 percent of GDP. Investors began to pull their money out of Iceland‚Äôs banks, depreciating the value of their currency, the Icelandic krona (ISK). This was triggered by an insolvency of the private banking sector. The largest Icelandic banks had liabilities in excess of 80 percent of GDP .  Purpose of the IMF Intervention (2008)  Iceland needed assistance from the IMF and from its Nordic partners in the Nordic Council. Previously, there was little oversight on the banks, enabling them to take what measures possible. The goal of Iceland in this market intervention was to stem capital outflows, to restore confidence in the Icelandic economy, thus, stabilizing the krona. In 2008, IMF approved $2.1 billion, 2 year loan to Iceland. The purpose of the loan was to help revive the economy to allow the Icelandic krona to gain value. Once the IMF executive board approves, Iceland could immediately take out $833 million of the loan. Measures adopted by Iceland included an emergency nationalization of the failing banks, a vote of the Icelandic parliament gave the FME (Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority) broad authority over the insolvent banks. FME proceeded to audit these banks and to split their assets. Measures were also introduced to increase the minimum capital adequacy ratio of the banks to 10% as a part of the effort to re establish confidence in the economy. As a part of these reforms the authority of the FME was increased to improve the stability of the Icelandic banking sector and enforce the introduced measures. Along with regulatory and banking changes, fiscal policy was also modified to respond to the shock in the following ways. The assumption of the banking sector debt by the Bank of Iceland was one of the initial measures acted upon. As a consequence the public debt increased from 29% in 2007 to 105% of GDP by 2009. To cope with the increased debt burden the Icelandic government adopted a medium term debt reduction plan; the structural balance be set at positive 2-3 percent by 2010. Additionally Iceland determined that it would not support the losses of its pension funds and social service programmes in order not to take up additional obligations.  Monetary and Fiscal policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis  One of the primary objectives of the Icelandic government in seeking an IMF programme was to stabilize the ISK and to set a path for its gradual appreciation. To stabilize short term pressures on the ISK the Central Bank of Iceland raised interest rates to 18% and prepared to back the krona with its foreign reserves, specifically for which Iceland asked for an IMF programme . The long term stated interest rate objective was to maintain 4.5% interest rate by 2010.  Years beyond the Financial Crisis (current status)  2018: GDP growth is rising at a steady pace, despite a 4% decrease from other years. While there was a small decline, economy still remains stable. Employment is abundant, enabling citizens to consume goods. The Icelandic statistical agency measures a positive trade balance of Icelandic Krona 123,702 million for the first three business quarters of 2018 when accounting for both goods and services exports. The largest export item measured was travel, which accounted for nearly 50% of all exported services as well as for the relatively heavy demand for petrochemical and aviation products Imports are measured a $6.62 billion and exports at $4.74 billion resulting in a negative balance of trade for 2018 so far. The trade deficit arose from strong consumption and business investment, especially evident in the procurement of aircraft, petrochemical aviation products and agricultural and consumer goods.

The formation is located with Tsuchiya Takakoshi prefectural natural park, and is thought to have formed 1.2 million years ago. The formation is designated as a natural treasure of Japan.  Description  The pillars of earth seen at Awa are hoodoos, thin spires of rock that have been weathered in such a way as to take on an unusual shape. As opposed to other rock formations, hoodoos are created when a harder type of rock forms above a softer rock; as wind, rain, and other natural processes gradually wear down the stone, the soft rock is worn away faster than the hard rock (which is known as a \\"cap\\"), creating a cone or pillar. Continuous erosion of the soft rock causes the cap to grow unstable, eventually falling off and exposing the rest of the pillar to erosion.Bruthans, Jiri; Soukup, Jan; Vaculikova, Jana; Filippi, Michal; Schweigstillova, Jana; Mayo, Alan L.; Masin, David; Kletetschka, Gunther; Rihosek, Jaroslav (July 2014). \\"Sandstone landforms shaped by negative feedback between stress and erosion\\".

Later he became a noted and sought-after art dealer. He was based in London but travelled widely on the Continent, and was one of the first dealers to introduce the works of Murillo to Britain. Biography Blackwood was born in Edinburgh on 2 October 1696, and baptised two days later, a younger son of Sir Robert Blackwood of Pitreavie, a rich silk merchant and one-time (1711-1712) Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and Jannet Glas (variously spelled). Records suggest that in 1716 Blackwood was indentured to Robert Aston, a merchant in London, although there is nothing to confirm this was the right John Blackwood. Blackwood initially set out on a political career, and at the 1727 British general election, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Glasgow in a contest. However, on 28 March 1728, the Commons awarded the seat to his opponent, Daniel Campbell, on the merits of the return. Blackwood presented a petition which was referred to the elections committee, who reached no decision. The petition was renewed in 1730 and 1731 but never resolved. He did not stand again. Blackwood's first known business venture was to set up as a merchant, in partnership with John Cathcart in 1726 in London, at Nag's Head Court, Gracechurch Street. There were illicit and authorised aspects to their enterprise. The more lucrative source of income for the two merchants came from an illicit trade in wood via Kingston, Jamaica. They traded products of British industrial manufacture for the logwood that the Spanish cut, while silencing the royal officers of the province with a bribe of twelve per cent. They were also licensed by the South Sea Company to engage in the slave trade in Campeche, Yucat√°n, in particular to bring 199 slaves into Campeche in 1730-33, at forty pieces of eight for each negro they imported. Interestingly, John Howberry, aged 13, a negro servant to John Blackwood, was baptised in England on 10 August 1740. This enterprise continued until 1739, when the war with Spain broke out. There was not time to remove their effects and so they made a great loss from this and from the non-payment of debts owing to them. John Cathcart accepted a commission from Lord Cathcart to become Director of the Hospital in the Expedition to the West Indies, based in Cuba, then under the Lord Cathcart's command. The hope was John Cathcart could recover a considerable proportion of the debts and effects, and so restore health to the partnership. Meanwhile, Blackwood was in London looking after the stock and effects of the company. Cathcart worked hard during his three years in the West Indies and recovered ¬£600 of outstanding debts; he also paid more than ¬£360 of his own earnings to help offset the losses, and a further ¬£2,092 when back in London. But this was still insufficient, and the company was declared bankrupt on 19 August 1745. Account from John Blackwood to Sir Lawrence Dundas in 1750 It is not clear how, or exactly when, but at some stage Blackwood became interested in art and started dealing in paintings and sculptures. This was probably in the late 1730s or early 1740s, before the bankruptcy, and when money would have been available from the timber business. According to the Apollo journal, Blackwood ‚Äútravelled extensively on the Continent, assembled a sizeable collection there and then returned to London to dispose of it at leisure from their own homes or through the auction rooms‚Äù. He bought paintings by, and often directly from, artists who are now world-famous, but who were less well known in eighteenth century England. Samuel Ireland, the English engraver and art dealer reported in 1796 that the late Mr Blackwood had purchased a room full of Cuyp‚Äôs work some thirty years earlier ‚Äúfor seven or eight pounds a piece‚Äù. John Blackwood was one of the first British dealers to purchase the paintings of Murillo, who was especially collected by Sir Lawrence Dundas. Blackwood undertook several commissions for Dundas during which time they came friends. Murillos of this provenance are now in galleries around the world, e.g. The Vision of Saint Francis of Paola in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Denys Sutton has given a full description of Dundas's collection. Several auctions of the art works he acquired were held in Blackwood's lifetime. A two-day sale by Mr Langford at his house in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden in March 1760 featured about 120 paintings, many by eminent artists, as well as bronzes and other items. Family and property John Blackwood married Anne Shovell, daughter of Sir Cloudesley Shovell at St Luke's, Old Charlton, Kent on 28 July 1726. They had a daughter, Mary, and two sons: Shovell and John. Shovell married Katherine Ambrosia, daughter of Albert Borgard in 1761. Mary married Thomas Desaguliers on 18 March 1745 at St George's Chapel, Mayfair. Property in Crayford, Kent which once belonged to Sir Cloudesley Shovell eventually passed to his daughter Anne and her husband John Blackwood. They included \\"Howbery, Marshal's-place, the iron mills, a farm, called Wantsum, and other lands\\". John Blackwood died on 12 November 1777 while visiting Dundas at his home at Moor Park. He was buried a week later at St Paulinus Church, Crayford, Kent. Two auctions of Blackwood's property give a measure of how much he had personally amassed in his life. On 21 February 1778, Messrs. Christie and Ansell auctioned his \\"much distinguished, and valuable collection of pictures, fine bronzes, sepulchral urns, bustos, etc.\\" More than forty painters were listed, including Velazquez, Poussin, Rubens, Rembrandt and Cuyp.Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, Sales by Auction, 21 February 1778 Later that year a two-day auction was held of \\"The Improved Lease of the Genteel House, with convenient Offices, double Coach-House, and Stabling for Five horses, situated on the east side of Soho-square\\", together with furniture, wines and pictures.Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, Sales by Auction, 18 June 1778  References  Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Scottish slave traders Category:Art dealers from London Category:1696 births Category:1777 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies Category:British MPs 1727‚Äì1734 ","title":"John Blackwood (art dealer)"},{"id":"58946955","text":"Shahla Arbabi (born 1945 in Shiraz) is an Iranian-American artist who resides in the United States.

It originated in Germany and the names mean \\"the last one\\". It should not be confused with Letzter Stich which is a much simpler, positive game in which the aim is to win the last trick. Rules  These rules are based on the Erweitertes Spielregelb√ºchlein aus Altenburg.  Four players  If four play, a full Piquet pack of 32 cards is used. The cards ranks (from highest to lowest) as follows: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7. Seven cards are dealt to each player, the remaining 4 cards are held by the dealer. There are no trumps. The dealer now 'shoves' any 3 cards (typically low value ones) to rearhand (the player on his left). Rearhand shoves any 2 cards to middlehand, who shoves one card in turn to forehand on the dealer's right. Thus everyone ends up with 8 cards. Forehand now leads to the first trick and the remaining players, in clockwise order, aim to follow suit. If they are unable to, they may discard any card. The player who plays the highest card of the led suit wins the trick and leads to the next. The first 7 tricks do not count as far as the result is concerned, but the winner of the last trick, loses the game and scores a penalty point. If a player wins all the tricks in a 'march' (Durchmarsch), however, he wins and everyone else gets a penalty point.  Three players  If three play, the Sevens and Eights are removed. Each player is dealt 7 cards, the dealer gets 10. The dealer shoves 2 cards to rearhand who shoves one to middlehand, so that each player has a hand of 8 cards. Otherwise the rules are the same as those of the four- hand game.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The section of land where this district is now located was previously a large, fenced fair grounds, contained an exhibition building, race track, and judge's tower. However, as the city of Owosso grew, the land became more desirable for other uses. In the early 1890s, builder James Laverock pressed the city to sell him a portion of the fairgrounds. Laverock had previously developed other commercial and residential projects in Owosso, and the city acceded to his request. With his prominent place in the city, he was able to quickly build and sell solid working-class homes along Mason Street. By 1900, the tract along Mason Street was home to a series of working- class families, including a machine shop foreman, a dime store owner, a master mechanic for the Ann Arbor Railroad, several carpenters, the principal of the Owosso Business College, a watch-maker at Christian's Department Store, the proprt!tor of a book and stationery shop, clerks at Christian's and Duff's Grocery Store, a baker, a carriage painter, an agricultural implements salesman, a railroad brakeman, a janitor, a barber, and several widows. Description The Mason Street Historic Residential District is a residential section of Owosso that contains 40 lots developed with modest working-class homes from the 1890s. All but three are one of the three tract housing styles used by James Laverock. The remaining houses, constructed i nthe early 20th century, and complementary in materials and scale. The houses are primarily located along two blocks of Mason Street, with a few located on the central street, Oak, just north and south of Mason. Within the three housing styles used by Laverock, individual houses were differentiated by using different styles of wood ornamentation. The first style, used in 19 homes, is a two-story, L-shaped balloon-framed building sheathed in clapboard with a gable roof. These houses have simple balanced fenestration with the main entryway in the recess of the L, and a shed-roof front porch. The second style, used in 16 homes, is a two-story rectangular balloon-framed building sheathed in clapboard, again with a gable roof. These homes have a single- story addition in the rear, simple fenestration, and a front entryway. The third style, used in only two homes, is a two-story rectangular balloon-framed building sheathed in clapboard, with a gable roof. These two houses had slightly home complex fenestration and a small front porch.

After becoming a Catholic nun in Sweden in the 1950s, she returned to study in Copenhagen but moved to Israel in 1965. After years of further study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, she earned a doctorate in 1991. In addition to her extensive understanding of theology, especially the history of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, she is remembered for her interest in iconography and for guiding pilgrims through the streets of Jerusalem. Biography Born on 26 February in the Copenhagen district of Valby, Kirsten Stoffregen Petersen was brought up in a Lutheran home where her father took a special interest in the Christian youth organization, Frivilligt Drenge- og Pige- Forbund. She attended N. Zahle's School (1937‚Äì1948) and √òsters√∏gades Gymnasium, where she specialized in Latin and Greek, matriculating in 1951. From the age of 12, she regularly attended Roman Catholic services, converting to Catholicism when she was 18. On completing her school education, she moved to Vadstena, Sweden, where she became a Bridgettine nun. In 1962, together with several other sisters, she left the convent although she continued to be a nun. She was not happy with the patriarchal management of the Catholic Church, believing that women should be treated on an equal basis. After making a three-month pilgimage to the Holy Land in the summer of 1964, she returned the following year to study Sacred Scripture and Hebrew Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, graduating in 1969. In Jerusalem, she settled in a small hut on the Mount of Olives, but always welcomed those who visited her. It was her belief that all Christians had a part to play in the Holy Land. From 1970, Stoffregen-Pedersen was instrumental in reviving research and studies in Ge'ez, the language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, both in Jerusalem and abroad. She taught the history of the church and Ethiopian iconography. In 1975, she resumed her studies at the Hebrew University, earning an M.A. in African Studies in 1981 with a thesis titled \\"The History of the Ethiopian Community in the Holy Land from the Time of Emperor Tewodros II till 1974\\". In 1984, she embarked on Ph.D courses, receiving her doctorate in 1991 with the thesis \\"Traditional Ethiopian Exegesis of the Book of Psalms\\".

Its apparent visual magnitude varies between 6.97 and 7.80. System The EG Andromedae system hosts a white dwarf and an evolved giant star, with an orbital period of 482 days and a half. The giant star is losing mass through its stellar wind at a rate higher than 10‚àí6 /yr, and the white dwarf is accreting a fraction of this mass without forming an accretion disk. The white dwarf itself could emit a hot wind that interacts with the cooler one of the giant star, in addition to inducing the photoionization of the latter. X-ray observations, however, failed to detect emission coming from colliding winds, but established the non-magnetic nature of the white dwarf and estimated its accretion rate at 1-10 /yr. The giant star doesn't fill its Roche lobe but there are still large uncertainties on its mass and radius. Even the parameters of the white dwarf are not strictly constrained, but available models can give lower and upper limits. Spectrum The optical spectral classification of EG Andromedae is M2IIIep, the one of a cool giant star with a peculiar spectrum and strong emission lines. The white dwarf contaminates the spectrum of the giant star photoionizes the stellar wind, giving rise to the spectral peculiarities. Emission lines H-alpha and H-beta, as well as TiO and CaI ones, change in phase with the orbit. The white dwarf is best studied in the ultraviolet, where also highly ionized species sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus can be identified with their absorption or emission lines. X-ray observation of EG Andromedae detected a hot plasma (at a temperature of 3 keV) that is likely situated in the outer boundary layer of the white dwarf, without any contribution from an accretion disk. Variability To date, no outburst has been observed in EG Andromedae. The observed variability is well described by the two components eclipsing each other during the orbit. However, there is some evidence that the giant star and the wind flow have an intrinsic variation.

Though it largely lacked a firm structure, and consisted of loosely tied factions, the Royalist Party played a major role in Chinese politics during the 1910s. Supported by the Empire of Japan, members of the Royalist Party repeatedly conspired to restore the monarchy, launched insurgencies, and attempted to enable the secession of Inner Mongolia and Manchuria from China.  Name  The Royalist Party was known by a variety of names, such as Manchu loyalist party, Restoration Party, Imperial Clan Party, Reactionary party, Party of the Ancestral Shrine of the Ruling Household, and Party of the Aisin Goro Cult.  History   Foundation and early activities  Having ruled China since 1636, the Manchu Qing dynasty started to collapse upon the Xinhai Revolution's outbreak in October 1911. Diehard Qing supporters refused to accept this, and \\"blind to the inevitable trend\\" toward the formation of a republic, founded the \\"Society for Monarchical Constitutionalism\\" (later known as \\"Royalist Party\\") in December 1911. The society's purpose was to oppose republicanism, preserve the Qing dynasty as ruling house of China, and prepare for a \\"final showdown\\" with the republicans. Its initial headquarters was a shrine for the Eight Banners, and many of its first members were Manchu bannermen, as well as princes, courtiers, and relatives of the Qing dynasty. Its first leader was Imperial Guards General Liang-pi, while other notable members included Shanqi (Prince Su), Puwei (Prince Gong), General Tieliang, Duke Tsai-tse and Y√º-liang. They sold their collections of paintings and antiques to raise money for the anti- republican resistance. At the time, parts of the Royalist Party advocated for the foundation of a secessionist \\"Manchuria-Mongolia\\" state to at least preserve the monarchy in the Qing Empire's north. Gungsangnorbu, a probable Inner Mongolian Royalist Party member, was raising money for the Mongol independence movement amid the Mongolian Revolution of 1911. Yuan Shikai was among the most important opponents of the Royalist Party, first as a political rival during the Xinhai Revolution and later as President of China The situation for the Qing imperial government was increasingly undermined by military and political setbacks caused by the opposing republicans, and the Republic of China was proclaimed first in the country's south on 1 January 1912. The Qing court and its leading officials realised that their position was becoming untenable. The matter was discussed among the Qing princes during a conference on 17‚Äì20 January, where the Royalist Party's members took a hardline stance against any agreement which included the monarchy's abolition. Other princes believed that they had to yield to the republicans, while a large number remained neutral. The conference came to no real conclusion. Meanwhile, Yuan Shikai, a powerful Qing general who effectively controlled much of the army, was pushing for a compromise with the republicans. While Empress Dowager Longyu was ready to agree to Yuan's proposal and abdicate, the Qing hardliners strongly objected and became determined enemies to Yuan. By 23 January, their political position had been significantly improved: General Tieliang had managed to rally a significant number of Manchu officials to oppose the abdication, while General Feng Guozhang had claimed that he could crush the revolution if the royalists could provide him with sufficient sums of money, providing a morale boost to the hardliners. The Royalist Party started to undermine Yuan, and had managed to greatly weaken him by 25 January. The hardliners themselves suffered two major reversals on 26 January, however, when Liang-pi was assassinated by a republican revolutionary and the Beiyang Army declared for the republicans. The Qing court accepted that it had no other option other than abdication, while the Royalist Party members dispersed and fled into the foreign concessions. In the subsequent time, the court tried to fully cooperate with the new authorities in order to be left in peace, while Yuan Shikai rose to China's first president and de facto military dictator.  Buildup after the Republic's foundation  The Royalist Party was not finished, however, and its members continued to plot against the Republic. They attempted to rally public support to their cause, especially among the Manchu living in Manchuria and Beijing, and to build up a political base for the party. Qing restorationism enjoyed genuine support in northeastern China, especially due to the failure of the first Republican government to restore stability to China. The royalists enlisted military officers and foreign powers in their conspiracies. Shanqi even gained Japanese support in 1912 for the creation of a separatist state in Inner Mongolia where Puyi could be restored as emperor. This venture eventually failed. The party also advocated that the Qing court be moved to Manchuria, but this proposal was \\"repressed\\" by the republican authorities. The continued activism by the Royalist Party was widely perceived as grave threat to the Republic. It was feared that a civil war and the partition of China could result from the royalists becoming too strong. Despite this, President Yuan Shikai initially dealt with the party in a lenient way. Having sidelined both republicans and monarchists, he was mostly interested in maintaining his own power and warned the Qing court to keep its loyalists in check. Fearing that the Royalist Party's activity could cause a foreign intervention or the revocation of the court's favorable treatment, Empress Dowager Longyu ordered the party's dissolution in March 1912. Her order had no effect, but convinced the authorities that the royalists acted without influence by the court. Having failed to disband the Royalist Party, Yuan consequently attempted to sway them to his side. He appointed Puyi's former tutor Xu Shichang as minister of state in order to gain their support.  Militant resistance against the Republic  Royalist Party leader Shanqi (right) and his Japanese supporter Kawashima Naniwa (left) Nevertheless, the party became increasingly militant from March 1912, stirring up unrest in northern China. It tried to undermine President Yuan in any way possible to achieve the restoration of the monarchy. Royalist Party members spread anti-republican propaganda among the rural population and incited dissatisfied soldiers to mutiny. One of its most notable actions was to convince the New Army's 6th Henan Division to riot at Luoshan County in July 1912. By April 1912, the party's Hubei branch had allied with bandit Bai Lang and a number of secret societies. It launched an open rebellion, calling for the death of \\"all republican traitors\\" and the full restoration of the Qing Empire. Yuan Shikai had already considered the Royalist Party a threat before this uprising, also due to the rumoured membership of several prominent political figures such as Zhang Xun in the party. The president again offered reconciliation, and invited various Manchu princes to the funeral of Empress Dowager Longyu in Beijing on 27 February 1913 \\"to dispel the clouds of suspicion\\" on part of the Royalist Party. This stance changed when his republican opponents launched their own uprising, the \\"Second Revolution\\", in July 1913. Yuan used the revolution as excuse for drastic actions against all his rivals, including the royalists. He declared martial law and had the Royalist Party leadership in Henan arrested and executed. Despite this, other parts of the party remained active, further influencing the campaign of Bai Lang. The bandit opted to abandon the declining monarchist cause later in 1913, however, and aligned with the anti-Yuan Republicans. By the time Yuan had declared the creation of his short-lived Chinese Empire, the Royalist Party was led by Shanqi and was working with the Japanese to establish separatist states in Inner Mongolia and Manchuria. It received support by the Japanese Kwantung Army and agents (tairiku r≈çnin) such as Kawashima Naniwa. In 1916, the Japanese and the Royalist Party were planning a rebellion in Manchuria, using Shanqi's private army which consisted partially of Mongolian bandits and had raided northern China up to this point. The royalists would capture Mukden, and then assist the National Protection War against Yuan. There were also plans to coopt Manchurian military strongman Zhang Zuolin for this coup, as Zhang had already made overtures to the Royalist Party. As result of financial and political difficulties, the operation was eventually cancelled by Tanaka Giichi. Over time, the Royalist Party was mostly reduced in its activities to Northeast China, and very few of its members (among them Puwei and Shen Zengji√©) were involved in Zhang Xun's attempt to forcibly restore the Qing dynasty in 1917. Shen was appointed Minister of Education by Zhang, but when the restoration failed, he retired from politics completely. Following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Puwei proclaimed himself head of the Manchurian independence movement and candidate for ruler of Manchukuo. Nevertheless, the Japanese appointed Puyi as Chief Executive (later Emperor) of the new state.  Ideology  Elements of the Royalist Party supported the independence of Manchuria (pink) and Inner Mongolia (green), possibly as united state. The Royalist Party's official purpose was to preserve the Qing dynasty's ancestral shrine and other religious institutions, though in truth it tried to protect the monarchy, and later on to overthrow the Republic. Qing loyalists generally believed that it was only a matter of time until the republican \\"experiment\\" failed. By 1912, the party was divided into two factions. Though both aimed for the restoration of the monarchy and were united in their opposition to Yuan Shikai, the factions differed on certain points. The \\"extremists\\" were only ready to accept the Manchu Qing dynasty as rulers of China, whereas the moderates believed that another Manchu or Han Chinese dynasty would also be acceptable. Elements of the party supported the creation of an independent Manchuria and Inner Mongolia as early as December 1911, and separatism gained more followers among the royalists as time went on. The Qing loyalists also exhibited conservative and revisionist tendencies, as they continued to use the old dynastic calendar, and espoused traditional arts such as Classical Chinese poetry, and calligraphy. One of the most notable intellectuals of the Royalist Party, ex-Qing official and scholar Shen Zengji√©, co-founded the Confucian Society of Shanghai.

It occurs in China, Taiwan, Japan, Myanmar, and Vietnam. It is one of two species of Hypericum in the section Hypericum sect. Sampsonia. Description Hypericum sampsonii is a perennial herb tall with perfoliate leaves. The thick, papery leaves are lanceolate to oblanceolate, long and across, with pale undersides and dense pale or black glandular dots. The flat-topped flowerhead has between 20 and 40 flowers, each flower in diameter with 5 bright yellow petals. Each petal is long and across with pale glandular streaks or dots on the surface and black glands along the edges. Each flower has 30‚Äì42 stamens, 3 styles, and 3-parted capsules. The ovoid to pyramidal capsules reach in length and across with amber-colored vesicular glands scattered on the valves. The orange-brown seeds are approximately long. Hypericum sampsonii flowers between May and July and fruits between June and October. Taxonomy H. sampsonii was described in 1865 by Henry Fletcher Hance in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. It was named for its collector, \\"T. Sampson\\", who collected specimens in June 1865 along muddy rivrebanks \\"subject to overflows\\" near \\"Lukpo, 100 miles west of Canton\\" in southern China. The species was described as rare at that location. Several authors placed this species in the section Hypericum sect. Drosocarpium, though it is now segregated into H. sect. Sampsonia, along with Hypericum assamicum, based on the combination of perfoliate leaf pairs and vesicular- glandular capsule valves. Distribution and habitat Hypericum sampsonii occurs in China, Taiwan, southern Japan, eastern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. In China, it is found in Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. It occurs in thickets, grassy and riparian areas, and disturbed places such as roadsides and cultivated edges, at above sea level. Chemistry Hypericum sampsonii has been studied for potential use in medicine, including the treatment of \\"hematemesis, enteritis, traumatic hemorrhage, swellings, and cancer\\". It contains polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) including norsampsone.

Later finding increasing market opportunities in the country, the group set up a manufacturing facility in January 1965. The firm became a publicly quoted company in 1976 when Cadbury Schweppes sold 20% of its interest in the firm.

In 2006, the subsidiary processed 15,000 tonnes of cocoa beans into cocoa butter, cocoa liquor and cocoa powder. In 2006, the firm released a statement disclosing financial misstatements in a number of previous annual reports. Immediately after the disclosure, the CEO and finance director resigned their positions.

The icon was kept at Phileremos Monastery, Rhodes, presumably since the 12th century, although it was often said to have been brought to Rhodes from the Holy Land. It was captured by the Knights Hospitaller in their conquest of Rhodes in 1306/1310. Her fame is due to miracles attributed to her intercession, primarily in the Siege of Rhodes (1480). After the loss of Rhodes in 1522, the icon was rescued, and attached to the mainmast of the Santa Maria, a carrack captured from the Sultan of Egypt in 1507, during the Order's years of exile. Chapel of Our Lady of Philermos at Saint John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta, Malta, where the icon was kept from the 1570s to 1798 When the Order was given possession of Malta in 1530, the icon was held at the Church of St. Lawrence in their headquarters of Birgu. When the Order moved its base to the newly built capital city of Valletta in the 1570s, the icon was housed at a purpose-built side chapel at Saint John's Co-Cathedral. The icon remained in Valletta until the French invasion of Malta in 1798 which expelled the Order from the Maltese Islands. The French allowed the Order to take some relics with them, but without their precious reliquaries. The icon together with a fragment of the True Cross and of the hand of John the Baptist were passed by admiral Giulio Renato Litta to Paul I of Russia, who succeeded Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim as Grand Master. Paul placed them in the Priory Palace at Gatchina, near St. Petersburg. 19th-century copy kept in Assisi. In Russia, the icon was again covered in a riza of gold and precious stones. The riza includes a horseshoe- shaped diadem with rubies and diamonds, two necklaces of saphire and diamond, and a halo in the form of the Maltese cross, the eight points shown as protruding from behind the head of the Virgin. Tsar Nicholas I ordered a copy to be made, to be carried in processions due to the fragile state of the original. This copy is now kept in the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi. The relics survived the October Revolution, and were brought out of Soviet Russia by Maria Feodorovna in 1920, via Copenhagen. Her daughters gave it to Archbishop Anthony, president of the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church in exile. They were transferred to Belgrade in 1932 and placed under the protection of Alexander I of Yugoslavia, kept in the chapel of St Andrew in the royal palace at Dedinje until 1941. It appears that under the threat of Nazi invasion, they were moved to Ostrog Monastery in Montenegro. In 1951, a detachment of Yugoslav special forces captured the relics, and they were secretly placed in the vault of the museum at Cetinje. Their presence there was publicly revealed only in 1993, on the occasion of the visit of Russian patriarch Alexis II of Moscow.

She was a daughter of the duke of Qi, and as such a member of the Jiang clan which traditionally provided brides to marry the princes of the Zhou dynasty. Legend Queen Jiang was reportedly a wise and virtuous queen whose actions advanced the well-being of the nation. One story mentioned in the book Biographies of Exemplary Women tells that King Xuan became accustomed to go to bed early in the afternoon and awakening late in the morning. His consorts awaited him in his bedroom where he lay with them every night, largely neglecting state affairs while the kingdom sank into crisis. Once Queen Jiang left his room in the morning, before he had woken up. She removed the pins of her hair and unmade her hair bun. Then she went to the hall of penitence and asked a maiden to summon the king with the following message: :\\"I am incompetent, and my dissolute heart has manifested itself today once more. I, on multiple occasions, have distracted my ruler and made him be late to meet with the court ministers. If a man takes great delight of his women, he soon forgets about others and becomes addicted to extravagance, and thus disorder begins. This disorder has its start in me. I, your servant, therefore request that the blame for this crisis be put upon me and that I alone suffer all due consequences.\\" Upon listening to this plea, the king became ashamed and acknowledged the queen's worries even though she did not utter a word of criticism against him. Thus the king was moved by her humility and sacrifice and immediately corrected his ways in order to stop her from demanding a punishment. He even was quoted saying: \\"I am not a ruler of the most virtuous, but it is impossible not to recognize that nobody but myself is responsible for everything.\\" King Xuan died in 781 BC and King You ascended to the throne. Queen Jiang soon fell into a deep depression and died shortly afterwards. This contributed to young King You's disorderly behavior which led to the fall of the Western Zhou dynasty in 771 BC.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1978. Overview The site consists of two separate groups of kofun, located approximately one kilometer apart, located approximately 10 minutes by car from Arai Station on the JR Shinetsu Main Line. The Kannondaira Site consists of three groups of approximately 53 kofun, including one keyhole-shaped tomb dating from the 3rd century. Most of the tombs are dome-shaped, although one is scallop-shaped and some are square- shaped, indicating that the site is from a transitional period between the Yayoi period and the Kofun period. Haniwa and fukiishi have been recovered from the area. The keyhole-shaped tomb is No.4 in the group, and has a total length of 33.6 meters, with a dome-portion measuring 19.0 x 23.0 meters, and a trapezoidal portion with length of 11.6 meters and width of 7.0 meters, narrowing to 50 meters at the \\"neck\\" where it connects with the dome. No grave goods were found in this tomb. The Tenjind≈ç Site also consists of three groups of kofun, of which 188 have thus far been catalogued, making it one of the largest sites in Niigata Prefecture. Almost all are small and dome-shaped, with diameters between five and 20 meters. The site has been repeatedly excavated by Tokyo University. Grave goods recovered include Sue ware, bronze mirrors, straight iron swords, parts of armor, horse fittings and items of jewellery. From these grave goods, it is estimated that these tombs were constructed from the late 5th century to the late 6th century. The sites are open to the public as an archaeological park, and has a small museum to display some of the artefacts found.

Belt later sued Margaret Ethel MacDonald over remarks she made about Montefiore in relation to this, with MacDonald's husband Ramsay settling the case out of court for ¬£120. Belt relocated to London, where he became an organiser for the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union.

Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called \\"sunset\\" clauses. Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe. Temporary laws are favored by adherents of \\"Experimentalist governance\\" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation. Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time. Temporary law should not be confused with ratione temporis or temporal jurisdiction which refers to the jurisdiction of a court of law in relation to the passage of time.  Examples  Some examples of temporary laws: * May Laws, enacted in Russia in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely. * Tehcir Law, enacted by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 authorized the ethnic cleansing of the empire's Armenian population. * Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature. * Patriot Act, enacted in the United States in 2001. * Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, enacted in Israel in 2003.

It operated from 1898 to 1901.  History  The school opened in October 1898 in a large house and stable at No. 6 Passage Stanislas, near the Rue Notre Dame du Champs. The business side of the school was handled by Whistler's former model Carmen Rossi, for whom the school was named, and her musician husband. The number of students was limited to forty, most of whom were women.Elizabeth R. & Joseph Pennell, \\"The Acad√©mie Carmen,\\" in The Life of James MacNeill Whistler (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1911), pp. 373-88. More than half of them were American, \\"with several also coming from England, Ireland, and Scotland.\\"Mary Augusta Mullikin, \\"Whister's Teachings,\\" The Boston Evening Transcript, March 17, 1904. Instructors for the first year were Whistler (painting) and American sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies (life drawing).Frederic William MacMonnies, from The Correspondence of James MacNeill Whistler. Whistler taught without pay as a \\"visiting professor,\\" and appeared once a week to offer criticism. Initially, all the students met in a single class. Whistler made his first appearance at the beginning of the second week, and, at his insistence, the students were separated into women's and men's classes. Experienced students were appointed teaching assistants. The women's class was led by Irish painter Inez Eleanor Bate for the length of the school's tenure.Inez Eleanor Addams, from The Correspondence of James MacNeill Whistler. The men's class was led by a series of assistants--American painter Earl Stetson Crawford,Earl Stetson Crawford, from The Correspondence of James MacNeill Whistler. Czech painter Alphonse Mucha,Alphonse Mucha: Master of Art Nouveau, exhibition catalogue, (Glen Falls, NY: The Hyde Collection, January 2018). Italian painter Cyrus Cuneo, and lastly, American painter Clifford Addams. With a dearth of sculpture students, MacMonnies left after the first year. In a 1906 magazine article, Cuneo described Whistler's eccentricities, his inability to communicate effectively as a teacher, and his strong favoritism toward the women's class:Cyrus Cuneo, \\"Whistler's Academy of Painting, Some Parisian Recollections,\\" The Pall Mall Magazine, vol. 38, no. 163 (November 1906), pp. 531-40. \\"Instead of sitting down in the usual French fashion and giving each pupil in turn a clear and matter-of-fact criticism, Whistler airily picked his way amongst the easels, glancing here and there, ignoring some canvases altogether, greeting others with 'Yes--yes.' \\" \\"Whistler's methods and manner confused the average students who came, but his faith in his system was as great as the students' unbelief.\\" Despite the prestige of his fame and reputation, many of the students dropped out. The frustration of the male students was expressed in a poem Whistler found scrawled on a wall of the men's studio: > I bought a palette just like his, > His colours and his brush. > The devil of it is, you see, > I did not buy his touch. The frustration turned to resentment in the second year. Whistler's apprentice Inez Eleanor Bate recalled: \\"[A]t the latter part of the season he often refused to criticize in the men's class at all. He would call sometimes on Sunday mornings [when the school was empty], and take out and place upon easels the various studies that had been done by the men the previous week, and often he would declare that nothing interested him among them and that he should not criticize that week, that he could not face the 'blankness' of the atelier.\\" By the third year, the men's life class was cancelled due to lack of students. Whistler was not always in good health, which may have accounted for many of his absences. His doctors recommended convalescence in a warmer climate, and he sent New Year's greetings for 1901 to the students from Corsica. The school continued to struggle, and descended into quarrels and mistrust. \\"In the end, the want of confidence in him, his illness, and his absence broke up the school.\\" Whistler announced its closing in a letter sent from Corsica, and read aloud to the students on April 6, 1901.Robyn Asleson, \\"The Idol and His Apprentices: Whistler and the Acad√©mie Carmen of Paris,\\" in Linda Merrill, et al., After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting (Atlanta, GA: High Museum of Art, 2003), pp. 74-84. Whistler's hopes of establishing an art school in London under the management of apprentices Inez Eleanor Bate and Clifford Addams, who married in 1900, were defeated by his continued poor health. He died in London on July 17, 1903, at age 69.

It is thought to be the oldest surviving building on Butler Street, the main commercial street in Lawrenceville. The structure was probably built by John Kingan between 1833 and 1846, as the price of the property when Kingan sold it indicates there was already a substantial building on the site. At the time, it was at the edge of the built-up area of Butler Street, which spanned approximately one block on either side of the Allegheny Arsenal (that is, 38th Street to 41st Street). John Naser, a German immigrant, bought the property in 1846 and operated an inn and tavern there which he called \\"Our House\\". His son Charles took over the business in the 1870s and expanded the building with several additions, including a second floor which was built sometime between 1893 and 1905. The Naser family sold the building in 1943. As of 2018 it houses a branch of Pennsylvania's state-run liquor store, Fine Wine & Good Spirits.

He served as the head of three Belgrade based museums, the Museum of Prince Pavle (the modern-day National Museum of Serbia), the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Gallery of Frescoes. Biography Of humble origins, Ka≈°anin adopted his mother's surname because he was born out of wedlock. Granted a scholarship, he studied art history at the Sorbonne. With the dissertation Bela crkva Karanska (The White Church of Karan), Ka≈°anin obtained his PhD from the University of Belgrade in 1926. He was curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, director of the Museum of Prince Pavle (the modern-day National Museum of Serbia) and the Gallery of Frescoes in Belgrade. He is also known as one of the organizers of some of the first major European art exhibitions in Belgrade, The Italian Portrait Through the Ages, in 1938, and French Painting of the 19th Century one year later. Apart from organizing foreign exhibitions in Yugoslavia, he also organized exhibits of Serbian frescoes and other art in many European capitals, as well as in South America. Ka≈°anin was the founder and editor of the magazine Umetniƒçki pregled (Art Review), which was published between 1937 and 1941. He served as the head of the Museum of Prince Pavle between 1935 and 1944. In order to compile the art collection of the Museum of Prince Pavle, Ka≈°anin traveled through Europe and stayed in the Netherlands, among other places. His travel reports, first published in newspapers and later also in the anthology Pronaƒëeni predmeti (Lost Objects) (1962), are a testimony to this. The organization of the exhibitions of both Yugoslav art in Amsterdam and Dutch art in Belgrade is also attributed to Ka≈°anin; for this, the Dutch Government bestowed him with a state decoration. As part of his scientific work, he researches Serbian art from the Middle Ages to the modern era. His interpretations are based on insights gained by the French research school of the interwar period and are written in a refined style and with a thorough analysis. It also brought him into the company of Serbian artists and collectors such as Milan Konjoviƒá and Pavle Beljanski respectively. Ka≈°anin also made a significant contribution to the knowledge of Serbian medieval literature. He began publishing art criticism in 1924 and was published in magazines such as Politika, Vreme and in the magazine Reƒç i slika. In 1927, he co-authored a book with Veljko Petroviƒá on the contribution of Serbian artists to the visual arts in Vojvodina. He was also noted for his fierce literary criticism. After World War II, Ka≈°anin fell out of favor with Yugoslavia's new communist government because of his former close ties with Prince Pavle, and struggled to get a job and publish his books. Ka≈°anin had four children, three sons and a daughter. His brother Radivoje was an accomplished mathematician and academic, while some of his friends included the fellow art historian Kenneth Clark, and Serbian writers such as Isidora Sekuliƒá, Anica Saviƒá Rebac, and Ivo Andriƒá. His collected works were published in 2002 with a total of eight volumes. Ka≈°anin was a recipient of the Order of St Sava (I, III and V degree), the Order of the Yugoslav Crown,\\"Prosvetni Glasnik\\" Belgrade, 1936. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ the French Legion of Honour, the Order of Orange-Nassau (III degree), the Danish Order (III degree), the Order of Polonia Restituta (III degree), and an Italian order.

It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Description Pawsonia saxicola has a solid, cylindrical body and can grow to a length of . The mouth is at the anterior end and is surrounded by a circle of ten, black and white, mottled, branching, tentacles used for feeding, up to long. The cuticle of the body is smooth with five longitudinal rows of tube feet. The ventral rows are double and clearly visible, while the dorsal rows are largely replaced by low button-shaped protuberances, except near the mouth. The cuticle contains calcareous spicules which are star-shaped. This sea cucumber may be confused with Aslia lefevrei. Both live in crevices with their dark-coloured tentacles projecting; P. saxicola is white, but may darken somewhat when exposed to light, while Aslia lefevrei is brown. Distribution and habitat This sea cucumber is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from the west and south coast of the British Isles to the coasts of France, Spain and Portugal and to the Azores. Its habitat is rocky shores where it conceals itself in crevices and under rocks, from the lower shore down to around . Ecology Pawsonia saxicola is a suspension feeder, consuming diatoms and single-cell algae and also zooplankton, such as copepods, ostracods, protozoans, nematodes, jellyfish and larvae, as well as drifting organic particles. The food is gathered by the feeding tentacles which each in turn shrinks and bends and is inserted into the mouth; the two ventral tentacles are short and forked, and are used at the mouth to push particles inside. Although in some related species the short tentacles co-ordinate their activities with the longer tentacles, this is not the case in P. saxicola where they seem to act independently.

As such, it has a prominent position in human culture, religion, and myth. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the morning star and evening star.  Background and name  What is now known as the planet Venus has long been an object of fascination for cultures worldwide. It is the second brightest object in the night sky, and follows a synodic cycle by which it seems to disappear for several days due to its proximity to the Sun, then re-appear on the opposite side of the Sun and on the other horizon. Depending on the point in its cycle, Venus may appear before sunrise in the morning, or after sunset in the evening, but it never appears to reach the apex of the sky. Therefore, many cultures have recognized it with two names, even if their astronomers realized that it was really one object. In old English, the planet was known as morgensteorra (morning star) and √¶fensteorra (evening star). It was not until the 13th century C.E. that the name \\"Venus\\" was adopted for the planet (in classical Latin, though the morning star was considered sacred to the goddess Venus, it was called Lucifer). In Chinese the planet is called Jƒ´n-xƒ´ng (ÈáëÊòü), the golden planet of the metal element. It is known as \\"Kejora\\" in Indonesian and Malay. Modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean cultures refer to the planet literally as the \\"metal star\\" (), based on the Five elements.  Ancient Near-East Mesopotamia Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the Sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as single entity; instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star. Nonetheless, a cylinder seal from the Jemdet Nasr period indicates that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object. The Sumerians associated the planet with the goddess Inanna, who was known as Ishtar by the later Akkadians and Babylonians. She had a dual role as a goddess of both love and war, thereby representing a deity that presided over birth and death. The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both Inanna's mythology as well as her dual nature. Inanna's actions in several of her myths, including Inanna and Shukaletuda and Inanna's Descent into the Underworld appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus as it progresses through its synodic cycle. For example, in Inanna's Descent to the Underworld, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld, where she is killed, and then resurrected three days later to return to the heavens. An interpretation of this myth by Clyde Hostetter holds that it is an allegory for the movements of the planet Venus, beginning with the spring equinox and concluding with a meteor shower near the end of one synodic period of Venus. The three-day disappearance of Inanna refers to the three-day planetary disappearance of Venus between its appearance as a morning and evening star. An introductory hymn to this myth describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for Kur, what could be presumed to be the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West. In the myth Inanna and Shukaletuda, Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons. In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky. Inanna-Ishtar's most common symbol was the eight-pointed star. The eight-pointed star seems to have originally borne a general association with the heavens, but, by the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 ‚Äì 1531 BC), it had come to be specifically associated with the planet Venus, with which Ishtar was identified. In the Old Babylonian period, the planet Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat.Enn Kasak, Raul Veede. Understanding Planets in Ancient Mesopotamia. Folklore Vol. 16. Mare K√µiva & Andres Kuperjanov, Eds. ISSN 1406-0957 \\" Ninsi'anna\\" translates to \\"divine lady, illumination of heaven\\", which refers to Venus as the brightest visible \\"star\\". Earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign si4 (= SU, meaning \\"to be red\\"), and the original meaning may have been \\"divine lady of the redness of heaven\\", in reference to the color of the morning and evening sky.Heimpel, W. 1982. \\"A catalog of Near Eastern Venus deities.\\" Syro-Mesopotamian Studies 4/3: 9-22. Venus is described in Babylonian cuneiform texts such as the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, which relates observations that possibly date from 1600 BC. The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa shows the Babylonians understood morning and evening star were a single object, referred to in the tablet as the \\"bright queen of the sky\\" or \\"bright Queen of Heaven\\", and could support this view with detailed observations.  Canaanite mythology  In ancient Canaanite religion, the morning star is personified as the god Attar, a masculine variant of the name of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. In myth, Attar attempted to occupy the throne of Ba'al and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the underworld.John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. . ), pp. 172‚Äì173Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: The Bible & Spiritual Conflict (InterVarsity Press, 1997 . ), pp. 159‚Äì160 The original myth may have been about a lesser god, Helel, trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god El, who was believed to live on a mountain to the north. Hermann Gunkel's reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called H√™lal, whose ambition was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities, but who had to descend to the depths. It thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun. Similarities have been noted with the story of Inanna's descent into the underworld, Ishtar and Inanna being associated with the planet Venus. A connection has been seen also with the Babylonian myth of Etana. The Jewish Encyclopedia comments: ::\\"The brilliancy of the morning star, which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night, may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of Ethana and Zu: he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods ... but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus.\\" In the Hebrew language Book of Isaiah, chapter 14, the King of Babylon is condemned using imagery derived from Canaanite myth, and is called (, Hebrew for \\"shining one, son of the morning\\"). The title \\"Helel ben Shahar\\" may refer to the planet Venus as the morning star.Gunkel, \\"Sch√∂pfung und Chaos,\\" pp. 132 et seq. The Hebrew word transliterated as H√™l√™l or Heylel (pron. as Hay- LALE),Strong's Concordance, H1966 occurs only once in the Hebrew Bible. The Septuagint renders ◊î÷µ◊ô◊ú÷µ◊ú in Greek as ·ºôœâœÉœÜœåœÅŒøœÇ (he≈çsphoros), \\"bringer of dawn\\", the Ancient Greek name for the morning star. According to the King James Bible-based Strong's Concordance, the original Hebrew word means \\"shining one, light-bearer\\", and the translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \\"Lucifer\\". However, the translation of ◊î÷µ◊ô◊ú÷µ◊ú with the name \\"Lucifer\\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the name occurs begins with the statement: \\"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\\" After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues: ::\\"How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'\\" This passage was the origin of the later belief that Satan was a fallen angel, who could also be referred to as \\"Lucifer\\". However, it originally referred to the rise and disappearance of the morning star as an allegory for the fall of a once-proud king. This allegorical understanding of Isaiah seems to be the most accepted interpretation in the New Testament, as well as among early Christians such as Origen, Eusebius, Tertullian, and Gregory the Great. The fallen angel motif may therefore be considered a Christian \\"remythologization\\" of Isaiah 14, returning its allegorical imagery of the hubris of a historical ruler to the original roots of the Canaanite myth of a lesser god trying and failing to claim the throne of the heavens, who is then cast down to the underworld.  Egypt  The Ancient Egyptians believed Venus to be two separate bodies and knew the morning star as Tioumoutiri and the evening star as Ouaiti.  Vietnam  The Moon pictured alongside Venus. In Vietnamese folklore, the planet was regarded as two separate bodies: the morning star (sao Mai) and the evening star (sao H√¥m). Due to the position of these supposedly distinct bodies in the sky, they went down in folk poetry as a metaphor for separation, especially that between lovers. When it was in the opposite direction of the Moon, the planet was also known as sao V∆∞·ª£t (the climbing/passing star, also spelled as sao V∆∞·ª£c due to different Qu·ªëc ng·ªØ interpretations of one N√¥m character). Such an opposition, much like that between the morning star and the evening star, has also been likened in folk poetry to the separation of ill-fated lovers, as evidenced by this l·ª•c b√°t couplet: :\\"M√¨nh ƒëi c√≥ nh·ªõ ta chƒÉng? :Ta nh∆∞ sao V∆∞·ª£t ch·ªù trƒÉng gi·ªØa tr·ªùi.\\" :(When you go, do you miss me? :I am the climbing star waiting for the moon in the sky.)  Hinduism  Shukra is the Sanskrit name for Venus In India Shukra Graha (\\"the planet Shukra\\") which is named after a powerful saint Shukra. Shukra which is used in Indian Vedic astrology means \\"clear, pure\\" or \\"brightness, clearness\\" in Sanskrit. One of the nine Navagraha, it is held to affect wealth, pleasure and reproduction; it was the son of Bhrgu, preceptor of the Daityas, and guru of the Asuras. The word Shukra is also associated with semen, or generation.  Persia  In Iranian mythology, especially in Persian mythology, the planet usually corresponds to the goddess Anahita. In some parts of Pahlavi literature the deities Aredvi Sura and Anahita are regarded as separate entities, the first one as a personification of the mythical river and the latter as a goddess of fertility, which is associated with the planet Venus. As the goddess Aredvi Sura Anahita‚Äîand simply called Anahita as well‚Äîboth deities are unified in other descriptions, e. g. in the Greater Bundahishn, and are represented by the planet. In the Avestan text Mehr Yasht (Yasht 10) there is a possible early link to Mithra. The Persian name of the planet today is \\"Nahid\\", which derives from Anahita and later in history from the Pahlavi language Anahid. Islam In Islamic traditions the morning star is called , Zohra or Zohrah and commonly related to a \\"beautiful woman\\".Muhammad Asad The Road To Mecca The Book Foundation 1954 According to myth, of which an echo is found in a play by the 17th-century English poet William Percy, two angels, Harut and Marut, descended to earth and were seduced by Zohra's beauty to commit shirk, murder, adultery and drinking wine. In their drunken state, Zohra elicited from these angels the secret words to ascend to heaven. When she spoke the secret words, she elevated herself to the first heaven, but was imprisoned there (i.e. transformed into the planet Venus).Matthew Dimmock (editor), William Percy's Mahomet and His Heaven: A Critical Edition Ashgate Publishing 2006 page 18this is from Jewish history.  Ancient Greece and Rome  Hesperus as Personification of the Evening Star by Anton Raphael Mengs (1765). The Ancient Greeks called the morning star , , the \\"Bringer of Light\\". Another Greek name for the morning star was Heosphoros (Greek He≈çsphoros), meaning \\"Dawn-Bringer\\". They called the evening star, which was long considered a separate celestial object, ' (, the \\"star of the evening\\"). By Hellenistic times, the ancient Greeks had identified these as a single planet, though the traditional use of two names for its appearance in the morning and the evening continued even into the Roman period. The Greek myth of Phaethon, whose name means \\"Shining One\\", has also been seen as similar to those of other gods who cyclically descend from the heavens, like Inanna and Attar. page 90: \\"it is even more definitely certain that we are dealing with a native myth!\\" In classical mythology, Lucifer (\\"light-bringer\\" in Latin) was the name of the planet Venus as the morning star (as the evening star it was called Vesper), and it was often personified as a male figure bearing a torch. Lucifer was said to be \\"the fabled son of Aurora and Cephalus, and father of Ceyx\\". He was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.\\"Lucifer\\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica] The Romans considered the planet Lucifer particularly sacred to the goddess Venus, whose name eventually became the scientific name for the planet. The second century Roman mythographer Pseudo-Hyginus said of the planet:Astronomica 2. 4 (trans. Grant) :\\"The fourth star is that of Venus, Luciferus by name. Some say it is Juno's. In many tales it is recorded that it is called Hesperus, too. It seems to be the largest of all stars. Some have said it represents the son of Aurora and Cephalus, who surpassed many in beauty, so that he even vied with Venus, and, as Eratosthenes says, for this reason it is called the star of Venus. It is visible both at dawn and sunset, and so properly has been called both Luciferus and Hesperus.\\" Ovid, in his first century epic Metamorphoses, describes Lucifer as ordering the heavens:Metamorphoses 2. 112 ff (trans. Melville) :\\"Aurora, watchful in the reddening dawn, threw wide her crimson doors and rose-filled halls; the Stellae took flight, in marshaled order set by Lucifer who left his station last.\\" Luna accompanied by the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), or Lucifer and Vesper. Marble altar, Roman artwork, 2nd century CE. From Italy In the classical Roman period, Lucifer was not typically regarded as a deity and had few, if any, myths, though the planet was associated with various deities and often poetically personified. Cicero pointed out that \\"You say that Sol the Sun and Luna the Moon are deities, and the Greeks identify the former with Apollo and the latter with Diana. But if Luna (the Moon) is a goddess, then Lucifer (the Morning-Star) also and the rest of the Wandering Stars (Stellae Errantes) will have to be counted gods; and if so, then the Fixed Stars (Stellae Inerrantes) as well.\\"Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 19  Maya  Pre-Columbian Mayan Dresden Codex, which calculates Venus appearances Venus was considered the most important celestial body observed by the Maya, who called it Chac ek, or Noh Ek', \\"the Great Star\\". The Maya monitored the movements of Venus closely and observed it in daytime. The positions of Venus and other planets were thought to influence life on Earth, so the Maya and other ancient Mesoamerican cultures timed wars and other important events based on their observations. In the Dresden Codex, the Maya included an almanac showing Venus's full cycle, in five sets of 584 days each (approximately eight years), after which the patterns repeated (since Venus has a synodic period of 583.92 days). The Maya civilization developed a religious calendar, based in part upon the motions of the planet, and held the motions of Venus to determine the propitious time for events such as war. They also named it Xux Ek', the Wasp Star. The Maya were aware of the planet's synodic period, and could compute it to within a hundredth part of a day.  Other cultures  The Maasai people named the planet Kileken, and have an oral tradition about it called The Orphan Boy. Venus is important in many Australian aboriginal cultures, such as that of the Yolngu people in Northern Australia. The Yolngu gather after sunset to await the rising of Venus, which they call Barnumbirr. As she approaches, in the early hours before dawn, she draws behind her a rope of light attached to the Earth, and along this rope, with the aid of a richly decorated \\"Morning Star Pole\\", the people are able to communicate with their dead loved ones, showing that they still love and remember them. Barnumbirr is also an important creator-spirit in the Dreaming, and \\"sang\\" much of the country into life. Venus plays a prominent role in Pawnee mythology. One specific group of Pawnee, a North American native tribe, until as late as 1838, practiced a morning star ritual in which a girl was sacrificed to the morning star. In western astrology, derived from its historical connotation with goddesses of femininity and love, Venus is held to influence desire and sexual fertility. In the metaphysical system of Theosophy, it is believed that on the etheric plane of Venus there is a civilization that existed hundreds of millions of years before Earth's and it is also believed that the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara, is from Venus.Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India: 1925‚ÄîTheosophical Publishing House (in this book, Sanat Kumara is referred to as Lord of the World.) See in index under \\"Lord of the World\\".  In literature  The discovery in the modern era that Venus was a distant world covered in impenetrable cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus. Another appearance of Venus in popular culture is as the harbinger of destruction in Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision (1950). In this controversial book, Velikovsky argued that many seemingly unbelievable stories in the Old Testament are true recollections of times when Venus, which Velikovsky claimed had somehow been ejected from Jupiter as a comet, nearly collided with the Earth. He contended that Venus caused most of the strange events of the Exodus story. He cites legends in many other cultures (including the Greek, Mexican, Chinese and Indian) indicating that the effects of the near-collision were global. The scientific community rejected his unorthodox book, but it became a bestseller. The 20 weeks at the top stated by Juergens in The Velikovsky Affair is incorrect.

He was a student of the √Öbo University and moved to Stockholm where he became a private teacher and a secretary. Through his work as a writer for the Freemasons he came in to contact with Elis Schr√∂derheim, who introduced him to King Gustav III of Sweden. Gustaf Bj√∂rnram claimed to be able to communicate with the spirits of the dead and arranged well-attended s√©ances frequented by the king and Prince Charles, during which he allegedly forwarded predictions about the future from the dead. For a couple of years around 1780, he was an immensely fashionable medium in Stockholm, was inducted into the Freemasons and given a Sinecure by the monarch. He once performed a s√©ance in the church of Lov√∂, where he called upon the spirit of Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden in the presence of the king and a circle of his favorites, among them Adolf Fredrik Munck, where the father of the king appeared as a mask behind a curtain of smoke in the dark church. However, when his prediction about the death of the king's mother, which was eagerly awaited by the king, did not materialize, and the royal physician Sven Anders Hedin exposed him as a fraud by describing how he had witnessed his preparations for the so-called seance in the Lov√∂ church, he lost his favor with the king, who gave him a pension and dismissed him from court.

The album features an original song by American musician Skylar Grey entitled \\"Everything I Need\\", written by Grey and Elliott Taylor, the song is featured on the soundtrack and was released on the same day with the score album. Background On March 7, 2018, Rupert Gregson-Williams was announced as the composer for Aquaman. Gregson-Williams previously wrote the score for Wonder Woman, the fourth film in the DC Extended Universe. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gregson-Williams stated that Aquaman was his most ambitious film to date. First discussions with director James Wan prompted Gregson-Williams to start writing the score even before he was even hired. The basis of the score started with a theme for Arthur's parents, Queen Atlanna and Thomas Curry which served as the cornerstone for the love story between them in the film. From there, he mapped out different character themes for Black Manta which uses a mixture of synths and beats, and the film's primary villain, Ocean Master which Gregson-Williams describes as a \\"non-melodic theme, but you have to be worried about this guy.\\" The score was recorded at the Eastwood scoring stage located at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank with the Hollywood Studio Symphony with Alastair King and Nick Glennie-Smith serving as conductors. Andrew Kawczynski, Evan Jolly, Forest Christenson, Tom Clarke and Steve Mazzaro provided additional music.

Life and career Judith Copithorne grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia, in an artistic family. Her childhood was filled with the artistic milieu of her parents and the books left by an artist uncle who died young, all of which gave her wide-ranging ideas about the possibilities of art and literature. Judith Copithorne started writing and drawing at an early age and, by the time she attended the University of British Columbia, had formed her own ideas about the arts. At UBC, she studied under such prominent figures as Warren Tallman and George Woodcock. In the early 1960s she became acquainted with an informal group of \\"Downtown Poets,\\" including writers such as Gladys (Maria) Hindmarch, John Newlove, bill bissett, Gerry Gilbert, Maxine Gadd and Roy Kiyooka, centered around the Vancouver venues of Sound Gallery, Motion Studio and Intermedia Press. The Downtown Poets were involved in more radical experimentation than the established TISH group of the University of British Columbia, represented by poets such as George Bowering, Fred Wah, Frank Davey and Daphne Marlatt. The appellation \\"Downtown poets\\" was invented by UBC professor Warren Tallman to distinguish the San Francisco Renaissance- influenced UBC writers from the homegrown Canadian poets. Judith Copithorne has made many contributions to concrete poetry and other types of experimental writing in prose, poetry and visual poetry, with works centering on domestic space and community. Her primary work involves the intersection of text and visual forms, with early work combining text with abstract line drawings, called Poem-drawings. Copithorne continued to explore various media and by 2015 was working almost entirely with computer generated compositions. In the Introduction to the anthology Four Parts Sand, she describes her work in the following manner: Published in the first issues of blewointment and Ganglia, Copithorne went on to publish over 40 books, chapbooks and ephemeral items (a bibliography of her work was published by jwcurry in the March, 2009 issue #400 of 1 cent).

He created an instrument called the Live Electronic Orchestra (LEO), which integrated multiple instruments under a controller system and predated the MIDI controller by 10 years. Don Lewis at his one-of-kind creation, LEO (Live Electronic Orchestra)  History  Don Lewis grew up in Dayton, Ohio, in the 1940s and 50s. Lewis has stated that his interest in music began as a child after watching an organist perform at his church. Lewis later majored in Electronics Engineering at the former Tuskegee Institute. While there, he also sang with the Tuskegee Chorus and played music at rallies led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1961, Lewis enlisted in the US Air Force as a nuclear weapons specialist and later stationed for four years in Roswell, New Mexico. After his time in the Air Force, Lewis relocated to Denver, Colorado, where he worked as an engineering technician, choir director, and nightclub musician. While there, he was commissioned to write three symphonic works by the Denver Symphony Orchestra. Lewis later resigned his job as an engineering technician in Denver to become a full-time musician. He later studied singing with legendary vocal coach Judy Davis.  Career  After moving to Los Angeles, Lewis has worked with a number of celebrity musicians and producers, including Quincy Jones, Sergio Mendez, and Michael Jackson. He also opened for the Beach Boys during their 1974 tour. Lewis performed at the 1975 and 1976 Newport Jazz Festival at Carnegie Hall. Later he moved to San Francisco and performed there in the late 70's and early 80's. He scored for shows such as Rainbows End and Were You There for PBS, among others. Lewis has taught at UC Berkeley Extension and been a guest lecturer at Stanford University and San Jose State University. He also started two programs to encourage kids' interest in music and the arts: Young Expressions, a mentorship program for student artists around Pleasanton, California, and Say \\"Yes\\" to Music!, wherein Lewis performs at school assemblies.  LEO and Roland TR-808  Lewis is most famous for having created an early integrated sound controller for analog synthesizers, which he named Live Electronic Orchestra (LEO), 10 years prior to MIDI. Lewis designed LEO in 1974 and completed it in 1977 by linking various synthesizers to work together in live performance, limited at the time to mostly studio production. As of 2018, LEO is housed in NAMM's Museum of Making Music located in Carlsbad, California. The various instruments of LEO include * Hammond Concorde * (4) Oberheim Expander Module (SEM) * ARP Pro-soloist * (2) ARP 2600's * Roland Jupiter 4 * Roland Promars * Roland Space Echo * Roland Digital Chorus * Roland VP-330 vocoder * Roland TR-808 * Hammond X-66 pedestal * Pascetta Polyphonic Keyboard * Roland 8 channel mixer For over 10 years, Lewis collaborated with Ikutaro Kakehashi on rhythm units including the FR-7L, CR-68, CR-78 and the Roland TR-808, a drum machine that allowed musicians to program and create their own drum beats. He also contributed to the rise in popularity of other synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7. In the 1980s, the American Federation of Musicians claimed that Lewis's use of technology was a threat to musicians and encouraged the protesting of his performances as a result.  Documentary  A feature length documentary film, THE BALLAD OF DON LEWIS: The Untold Story of a Synthesizer Pioneer, produced and directed by multi-EMMY Award winner, Ned Augustenborg was released in March 11, 2020. The film covers Lewis's life, career, relationships, and his struggles with systemic racism; Lewis, in the 1980's was unjustifiably labeled as a \\"National Enemy\\" of the Musicians Union partly due to institutional fears regarding the technological advancements that Lewis so deeply embraced.

It has a surface area of about and has a maximum depth of about . It receives inflow through the R√≠o Chungara with some minor additional inflows, and loses most of its water to evaporation; seepage into the Laguna Quta Qutani plays a minor role. The lake formed between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago when the volcano Parinacota collapsed and the debris from the collapse dammed the Lauca River. Since then the lake has progressively grown owing to decreasing seepage. The lake is part of the Lauca National Park; a planned diversion of the lake's waters into the Azapa Valley being abandoned after a decision by the Chilean Supreme Court.  Name  The name Chungar√° or Chungara is derived from the Aymara language and has several different meanings: , a type of bush or moss plus the suffix that signifies \\"covered by\\"; but this meaning appears to have fallen into disuse. A second meaning is \\"beard\\" which together with the suffix means \\"bearded\\" and refers to a myth of a bearded man that came to the area and destroyed a community with fire.  Geography  Chungar√° Lake is located the northernmost part of Chile and close to the border with Bolivia. It lies at an elevation of in the Chilean Altiplano; it is one of the highest lakes in the world and the second highest-largest after Lake Titicaca in the Altiplano. The lake is part of the Lauca National Park, a nationally and internationally designated protected area, and a CONAF refuge lies close to the western shores of the lake. There is also a marina and a pumping plant in the northwestern area of Chungar√° Lake. Chile Route 11 passes by the southern and western shores of Chungar√° Lake. The lake is about wide and covers an irregular surface of about -, with two large embayments in the northeastern and the southern sectors of the lake and a narrower one in its northwestern corner. Its deepest point is - deep and lies in the northwestern sector of the lake. The northern and western side of the lake have steep shores, while the southern and eastern ones are much more gentle; the eastern shore is covered by a large alluvial fan and the southern one by sediments deposited by the R√≠o Chungara tributary. The lakefloor features platforms, flat areas and sloping areas. northwest from Chungar√° Lake lies the Lagunas Cotacotani. The volcanoes Parinacota () of Pliocene to Holocene age and Ajoya () of Miocene age lie north and west of the lake, respectively; the northern shore of the lake is formed by lava flows from Parinacota volcano. While Parinacota is well preserved, Ajoya and Quisiquisini () on the eastern shore of the lake are moderately eroded. Farther south from Chungar√° Lake lies the high Guallatiri.  Hydrology  The water temperature reaches its maximum during March with and a minimum in January with according to one study, while temperatures on the lakefloor range between . Water levels vary by between seasons and fluctuations of have been recorded. The present-day water levels are the highest in the history of the lake and there is no evidence of former lake highstands, and the depth of the lake has generally increased during the course of its history. There are some long term fluctuations in water levels, including a deepening episode during the latest Pleistocene and three or four episodes of water level lowstand during the middle and late Holocene at about 10,500, 9,800, 7,800 and 6,700 calibrated radiocarbon years ago. Since about 5,000 calibrated radiocarbon years ago lake levels have been high. The Lake Chungar√° is part of a large high-elevation watershed in the Altiplano, bordered on the west by the Lauca River watershed and on the east by the Bolivian frontier; the watershed is surrounded by snow-covered volcanoes. The largest tributary of the lake is the R√≠o Chungara with a discharge of about which originates on Guallatiri volcano and drains the area of the Nevados de Quimsachata (Acotango, Capurata and Umurata); this river contributes about 4/5 of the water to the lake and enters Chungar√° Lake on its southeastern corner through a river delta. Other tributaries are the Chachapay, Mal Paso (), Ajata () and Sopocalane ( only during wet periods) creeks which originate on Choquelimpie/Ajoya volcano, which have formed river deltas where they enter the lake; some of the deltas are submerged. In addition, springs supply water into the lake from its western and northern shores where volcanoes border the lake. There are no inflows on the eastern side of Chungar√° Lake. Chungar√° Lake has no outlet; its waters evaporate at a rate of about and also seep into the groundwater table at a rate of . The water chemistry of the Cotacotani Lakes imply that they receive water from Chungar√° Lake at a rate of about ; this constitutes over half of the inflow to the Cotacotani Lakes. The role of this underground outflow has progressively decreased through the history of the lake as silt has accumulated in the breccia through which the groundwater seeps out. The Cotacotani Lakes eventually drain into the Lauca River. The total volume of the lake is about . Chungar√° Lake is polymictic/well mixed and its waters transparent enough that sunlight can reach most of the lake floor. The waters of the lake are slightly alkaline and saline and show influence of dolomite rocks. This lake chemistry is homogeneous throughout the lake and the lake waters are subject to strong currents at the surface.  Geology  The lake was formed by volcanic-tectonic phenomena; specifically, a major collapse of the Parinacota volcano dammed a former Rio Lauca, forming Chungar√° Lake, at some time between 8,000 and 15,000 - 17,000 years ago. This collapse involved about and covered about with debris; before the collapse took place the lakefloor of Chungar√° Lake consisted of alluvial and river sediments left by the Rio Lauca which drained the area. Upon damming, water from the river accumulated and formed Chungar√° Lake. The exact time of the collapse is controversial. Faulting also played a minor role in the formation of the lake basin, with a southwest-northeast trending fault disrupting sediments in the northwestern sector of the lake. Since the birth of Chungar√° Lake, about of sediment have accumulated on its floor. Volcanism in the area has been ongoing since the Paleozoic and has continued until recent times, which has influenced Chungar√° Lake. A number of volcanoes such as Parinacota, Ajoya and Quisiquisini grew on a Miocene ignimbrite basement that crops out east of the lake; of these only Parinacota has been active in the Holocene, depositing tephra within the lake.  Climate  Temperatures at the lake average , fluctuating between at day and at night. The climate of Chungar√° Lake is arid and annual precipitation on Chungar√° Lake amounts to about , considerably smaller than the evaporation rate. This precipitation occurs during summer when moisture is transported into the region from the Amazon and the Atlantic Ocean; this is known as the \\"Bolivian Winter\\". Annual precipitation varies under the influence of the \\"ENSO\\" phenomenon. In addition, the area is characterized by a high solar insolation.  Human use  The area of the lake is inhabited by Aymara people who engage in animal husbandry, using alpacas, cattle, llamas and sheep and live on farms and pastoral refuges.

For this purpose, the Canal Chungar√° was built by the Chilean Ministry of Public Works to transfer water into the Laguna Cotacotani which is the headwater of the Lauca-Azapa system. This project was opposed by environmentalists. On 19 December 1985 the lake was the subject of a major legal case when the Chilean Supreme Court ruled that international obligations such as the CITES need to be considered by the Chilean government and prohibited the use of the waters of Chungar√° Lake; the ruling by disallowing the use of the waters of Chungar√° Lake forced the Arica y Parinacota Region to seek other sources of water for the growing economy. Accumulation of rubbish in the area of Chungar√° Lake has become a major issue, as a lot of waste is discarded by for example drivers on the Chungara‚ÄìTambo Quemado road between Chile and Bolivia. The Chilean government has thus organized cleanup operations to remove some of the waste.  Biology  The lake hosts a diverse plant and animal community. The landscape around the lake includes wetlands known as bofedales; otherwise the vegetation in the region of the lake consists mainly of Polylepis dwarf trees, shrubs and tussock grasses. The shoreline vegetation draws birds in such as Andean gull, Chilean flamingo, crested duck, giant coot and Puna plover. File:Fauna t√≠pica de Lago Chungar√°..JPG|Birdlife, including Chilean flamingo, at Chungar√° Lake File:Bolivia (4038147626).jpg|Shoreline vegetation and landscape Aided by the highly transparent waters, large amounts of aquatic plants live in Chungar√° Lake and are particularly noticeable on the southern shores, where Myriophyllum elatinoides and Potamogeton filifolius occur. The shores are inhabited by amphibians such as Rhinella, Pleurodema and Telmatobius, and by molluscs and turbellaria such as Ancylus, Pisidium and Taphius. The phytoplankton of the lake is dominated by diatoms in winter and by chlorophyceae in summer. Algae include both the large Cladophora and Nostoc genera and the small Botryococcus braunii, Cocconeis placentula, Cyclotella andina and Nephroclamys subsolitaria; the second and the third are diatoms. Copepods such as calanoids and cladocera make up the zooplankton. Microbial colonies occur on the shores of Chungar√° Lake.  Fish  The most important and only native fish in Chungar√° Lake are two endemics; the pupfish Orestias chungarensis and catfish Trichomycterus chungaraensis. Orestias chungarensis of Chungar√° Lake is most closely related to other Orestias species in the Lauca National Park but also those found in Salar de Ascotan and Salar de Carcote. This reflects that these waterbodies and the Lauca River were once joined by the former Lake Tauca. In Chungar√° Lake these fish occur at elevations of over ; Orestias is among the fish with the highest occurrences in the world. They are further considered to be threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the Chilean National Museum of Natural History. The rainbow trout also lives in the lake and is considered an invasive species there as it feeds on the threatened Orestias fish; the Chilean government has thus envisaged to take measures to eradicate the fish from the lake.

He began work on it in 1761 but only finished it in 1774. It was rejected by the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and published unperformed in 1775. Action The action takes place at the court of medieval Castille. Don P√®dre (Peter of Castile) faces claims from his half brother Transtamare (Henry II of Castile) both for the throne and for the hand of L√©onore de la Cerda. With better connections and the support of the Church, Transtamare defeats Don P√®dre with the help of French soldiers led by Bertrand du Guesclin. Transtamare murders P√®dre with his own hands and seizes the throne. L√©onore chooses to die rather than endure marriage with him.Siegfried Detemple: Voltaire: Die Werke, Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag, Berlin, 1994, p.237ff Background Voltaire began working on the material for the play in 1761. As his campaigns against Church abuses gathered pace (under the slogan '√©crasez l‚Äôinf√¢me‚Äô) he reworked it to place particular emphasis on the unhealthy influence of the religious authorities.Val√©rie Andr√©: Don P√®dre, in: Dictionnaire Voltaire, Hachette Livre, 1994, p.137 Voltaire‚Äôs perspective on the characters was unusual; most previous writers had presented Transtamare as a hero and Don Pedro as his evil opponent; he reversed the usual roles. Publication The Com√©die-Fran√ßaise declined to put on the play, and it was not taken up by any other theatre. This rejection was not particularly to do with the play's critical attitude towards the Church, but more to do with the unsatisfactory and inconsistent characterisation. When the play was published, Voltaire added a dedicatory letter to d'Alembert and a historical and critical discourse about the tragedy, as well as four short texts: √âloge historique de la raison, De L'encyclop√©die, Dialoque de P√©gase et du vieillard and La Tactique.

It is part of the McGill University Health Centre network and it is situated on the southern slope of Mount Royal along the east side of University Street, just north of Pine Avenue. It was founded in 1934 by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, who developed the Montreal procedure there for the treatment of epilepsy.  History  The Montreal Neurological Institute originated from the Sub-Department of Neurosurgery at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The Neuro was created at the RVH in 1933, before it moved to its newly-constructed building across University Street. The cornerstone of The Neuro was laid on October 6, 1933. On September 27, 1934 Sir Edward Beatty, chancellor of McGill University, declared the institute formally opened. The Rockefeller Foundation provided funds to build and equip the laboratories of the institute and created an endowment fund of one million dollars in support of the scientific work of the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery. The clinical, or hospital, part of the institute was built through donations from private individuals. The Province of Quebec and the City of Montreal agreed that they would be responsible for the hospital‚Äôs yearly operation. At the end of Penfield‚Äôs foundation address, he expressed the hope that the institute would act as a catalyst for Canadian neurology: ‚ÄúWe dare to hope that this is the inauguration of an institute of medicine that is characteristically Canadian, the birth of a Canadian School of Neurology.‚Äù  Open Science  In 2016, The Neuro became the first academic institution of its kind in the world to implement in practice the principles of open science, when the Lawrence and Judith Tanenbaum Family Foundation donated $20 M to establish the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute. Dr. Guy Rouleau, the current Director of The Neuro, was awarded the Canada Gairdner Wightman award in 2020, for identifying and elucidating the genetic architecture of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including ALS, autism and schizophrenia, and his leadership in the field of Open Science.  A Killam Institution  The Montreal Neurological Institute is a Killam Institution, supported by the Killam Trusts. In 1966, the Izaak Walton Killam Memorial Endowment Fund and Fund for Advanced Studies were established at the Montreal Neurological Institute through the bequest of Dorothy Johnston Killam. These funds support the academic and training mission of the Institute.

Argentina polar dogs were developed by the Argentine Army for the purpose of equipping their Antarctica bases with sled dogs. The breed was a result of crossbreeding between a Siberian Husky, a Greenland Dog, an Alaskan Malamute and a Manchurian Spitz. However, the breed went extinct in 1994 due to its being moved out of Antarctica in compliance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (PEPAT).Maida, Juan Carlos - F√≤rmica Horacio. El Perro Polar Argentino, su historia. Edici√≥n de la Junta de Historiadores del R√≠o de la Plata. Bs. As. 2014.  Origin  The need to travel quickly, cheaply, and safely across Antarctica caused a team of more than thirty non-commissioned officers of the Argentine Army, commanded by Hector Martin and Felix Daza Rodriguez, to develop a breed of dogs that were capable of carrying loads through long distances, easy to breed, easy to maintain, and able to fulfill operational functions similar to those of mechanical tracked transports. At the origin of the Argentine Polar Dog are the main Arctic dog breeds of work, and the formation of its genetic base and the stabilization of its standard took the military thirty-one years of work. Specially trained for the march or \\"mushing\\" with sledges, these dogs easily slipped on snowy or icy surfaces indistinctly. With the identification of Argentina as a bi-continental country, the exploration and conquest of Antarctica began in the 1950s and the desire to reach the South Pole came with it. General Hern√°n Pujato brought the first sled dogs from Alaska and Greenland, thus beginning the crossings.  Characteristics and abilities  The average weight of male Argentine Polar Dogs was 60 kilograms (132 lbs). The average weight of female Argentine Polar Dogs was 52 kilograms (115 lbs). Argentine Polar Dogs were shielded against low temperatures by their triple coat, which consisted of a wool layer, a hair proper and an undercoat, as well as a subcutaneous adipose layer 2 cm thick. The dogs had four sharp canine teeth or fangs in their mouths that served to tear, incisors that allowed them to cut, and molars to grind. This allowed the dogs to tear flesh easily. The sled tractor capacity of Argentine Polar Dogs was twice was much as any dog breed before it. A group of 11 Argentine Polar Dogs could drag a sled loaded with 1.1 tons (2200 lbs or 1,000 kg) at 35 km/h (22 mph) (on flat terrain) and 50 km/h (31 mph) on a 45¬∞ downward slope, in both cases without resting for 6 hours in a row. The normal working temperature of the dogs was -70 ¬∞C (-94 ¬∞F), and it has been documented that they were visiting and quietly waited outside the Soviet Vostok Station on the day when the historic cold world record was recorded (-89.2 ¬∞C, -128.6 ¬∞F). Argentine Polar Dogs filled the vital function of helping soldiers avoid cracks and deadly traps in the ice and detect them when nothing else could. They were also had a good sense of direction and were reliable in rescue operations, even during large storms. The dogs were able to move quickly and easily on unconsolidated roads or layers of thin ice that were unable to support the weight of motorized tractors. Argentine Polar Dogs could be sacrificed and used as food for men or dogs as a means of survival.  Food and care  Argentine Polar Dogs were fed once a day (twice as often as Siberian Huskies), but were highly valued because their maintenance cost was much less that the cost of fuel for diesel tractors moving the same loads. Argentine Polar Dogs were not given water to drink, as they were able to drink the snow. The food first brought by Hern√°n Pujato to start the race was pemmican, a tablet prepared with powdered meat, fat, and cereals that provided protein from beef, and calories from fat, and vitamins from a variety of berries. The advantage of using pemmican food concentrate was that it could be stored for long periods of time and did not take up much space. People living at Argentina's Antarctic Bases at the time mixed the food with remains of other meat, allowing the Argentine Polar Dog to grow sturdy and taller than its original breeds. Towards 1967, Argentine Polar Dogs had adapted to the cold Antarctica temperatures and began to reject the pemmican whose formula had changed. Before the possibility of rejection and the consequent weight loss of the dogs, the dogs began to be fed a more conventional food in its premium version. It was carried in twenty kilogram bags that were stocked in sheds until use. However, leftover human food continued to be mixed in. Veterinarians and the doctors at the Antarctica bases were responsible for the deliveries or injuries of the dogs. The primary cause of death for Argentine Polar Dogs was fighting, due to their breed's aggressiveness with their peers.  Famous dogs  Well-known Argentine Polar Dogs include Poncho and Simba. Poncho was a sled dog who was well known for his ability to warn men of hidden cracks in the ice in front of them. On one occasion, Poncho guided a rescue team to the survivors of an aircraft accident, who were all recovered safely. Simba was the sled and guide dog of General Hern√°n Pujato and General V√≠ctor Hugo Figueroa also had an Argentine Polar Dog named Hipo. In 1965, Colonel Jorge Edgar Leal selected Argentine Polar Dogs for his expedition to the South Pole.  Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty  The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, an agreement associated with the Antarctic Treaty of which Argentina is a signatory, explicitly ordered the withdrawal of all Argentine Polar Dogs from the continent of Antarctica, considering them an \\"exotic species\\". The deadline set for the evacuation of all Argentine Polar Dogs was April 1, 1994 and Argentina complied with this obligation, moving all Argentine Polar Dogs to South America.  Controversy regarding the Antarctic Treaty  The reasons that the PEPAT invoked to remove Argentine Polar Dogs from Antarctica came from a conclusion of Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, which reported that the dogs allegedly transmitted Canine distemper to seals, preyed on penguins, and they harbored parasites in their fur that were capable of upsetting the ecological balance of Antarctica. However, it has been proven that canine distemper is a virus, that can not be transmitted between species. The immunization records of the Argentine Antarctic bases where the Argentine Polar Dogs were raised and maintained show that all specimens were vaccinated as required by law, with two doses to the puppy and an annual reinforcement for all adults, including the annual revaccination for pregnant females that prevents infection. Expeditions without a permanent bases were obliged to follow this plan as well. The effectiveness of these vaccinations is demonstrated by the fact that during the period where Argentine Polar Dogs lived in Antarctica (1951-1994), not a single case of canine distemper was registered in the Argentine bases or the bases of any other country, concluding that the diseases was never present on the continent. The only diseases reported to have infected the dogs consisted of parasitosis and dermatitis transmitted to canines by penguins and seals. Records show that dogs may have once devoured a penguin, but it would have been beneficial in controlling the overpopulation of penguin breeding grounds. The equilibrium of the Antarctic ecosystem was damaged by the removal of the Argentine Polar Dogs, since they had to be replaced by tractors using fossil fuels. This usage of fossil fuels caused more pollution and waste than the dogs had done.  Evacuation to South America  Argentina did not denounce the PEPAT, but as a signatory, it exercised its right to vote against the removal of the Argentine Polar Dogs. But, they submitted to the will of the majority and decided to remove their dogs in two stages. The fifty-eight ling dogs were divided into two groups, one of 30 dogs and one group of 28 dogs. They were then removed from Argentine Antarctica and the first group was sent to Ushuaia, the capital of Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina. The second group was later sent to Mendoza, the capital of Mendoza Province, Argentina. The first governor of Tierra del Fuego Province, Jos√© Arturo Estabillo, named the Argentine Polar Dog Provincial Natural Monument in 1993 and also established a dog sledding race between the mixed breed descendants of Argentine Polar Dogs and other breeds.  Extinction  After 43 years of continuously working in Antarctica without any contact with other dogs, the Argentine Polar Dog had lost the natural immunity to common diseases found in dogs. Of the 30 dogs in the first group that moved from Antarctica to Ushuaia, Argentina, and Mendoza, Argentina, 28 died within the first year. Both survivors were males, making it impossible for them to breed and reproduce. Many of the dogs in the second group that left Antarctica met the same fate, and the few survivors were scattered and given to adoptive families far from each other. These survivors were crossed with other breeds of dogs, and any offspring were no longer pure Argentine Polar Dogs and they eventually disappeared. Today, the Argentine Polar Dog is considered extinct.

It was designed by local architect, Alfred C. Finn, and completed in 1924. It was first an owner-occupied four-plex. Later it was used as a hospital in 1945, converted to single-family residential use in 1970, and after 1997, re-purposed as law offices. The building was vacant through most of the 1950s and 1960s. History The Benjamin Apartments building is located on Webster at the corner of Caroline in Houston's Midtown neighborhood. Benjamin Cohen commissioned the design work for the four-plex in 1919, and resided in one of apartments for the first sixteen years of its existence. The apartments were converted for use as a hospital in 1945, which was known as Home Hospital and later as Physicians and Surgeons Hospital. A map from the early 1950s confirms its use as a hospital, but it lay vacant for seven years after 1952. By this time, the previous suburban character of the neighborhood transitioned to commercial buildings and boarding houses. An attempt to revive the building as a hospital in 1960 failed quickly as it stood unused from 1961 through 1968.Mod (2002), pp. 11‚Äì12. One room at the Benjamin was rented as an apartment in 1969 before John and Blanche Bankes converted it to a single-family residence in 1970. John Bankes lived there until his death in 1993, and Blanche remained there until 1997. A law firm acquired the property a year later, performed some renovations, then resold it to a real estate partnership in 1999. Mid-Continent Houston Properties, LTD converted the building to office use for one tenant.Mod (2002), p. 12. Architectural characteristics The Benjamin represents an early-20th- century stylistic synthesis of the Arts and Crafts movement with Renaissance Revival elements. Decorative flourishes at the front entrance are rendered into relatively austere interpretations. Subtle modulations in the polychrome patterns of the brick work introduce another decorative element.Mod (2002), p. 12. Non-original features of the property as recently as 2002 include: a metal fence around the back of the property, a car port, a paved surface parking lot, and an area for the dumpster and utilities.Mod (2002), p. 2.

Early life Cora was born on May 29, 1871 and grew up at Brookwood, the family home in Mount St. Vincent on the Hudson River. She was the daughter of Edmund Dutilh Fitz Randolph, a banker and insurance executive, and Helen Earle (n√©e Lothrop) Randolph. Among her siblings was Mary Welsh Randolph, who married Francis Egerton Webb, brother- in-law of Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt Webb and the son of Ambassador James Watson Webb. She was descended from the Fitz Randolph family that settled in Cape Cod in the early part of the 17th century. Her paternal grandparents were Dr. Charles Fitz and Margaret (n√©e Gooch) Randolph and her uncle was Wallace F. Randolph, a United States Army major general who became the first U.S. Army Chief of Artillery. Society life In 1892, Cora, who was then unmarried, was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. She was a charter member of the Colony Club, a member of the Huguenot Society, The Mayflower Society, and the Colonial Dames of America. Personal life On February 14, 1900, Cora was married to Richard Trimble (1853‚Äì1924), by the Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix of Trinity Church. Trimble was associated with J.P. Morgan & Co. in the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, later serving as its secretary and treasurer. Together, they were the parents of one son and two daughters: * Richard Trimble Jr. (d. 1941), who was captain of the 1926 crew team at Harvard College. He married Winifred Loew. * Margaret Randolph Trimble (1901‚Äì1968), who married Count Giovanni Revedin (1904‚Äì1990), the Italian diplomatic representative to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, in 1939. * Mary Trimble, who married Perry R. Pease, a member of the Jockey Club who sat on the executive committee of the Turf and Field Club. Cora died at her home, 1020 Madison Avenue in New York City, on December 31, 1946. She was buried at the Westbury Friends Cemetery in Westbury, New York.

She is Director of the Michael Barber Centre for Collaborative Mass Spectrometry. She develops and applies ion-mobility spectrometry‚Äìmass spectrometry to the study of molecule structure and is searching for biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. She co-leads the mass spectrometry theme for the Rosalind Franklin Institute. She was awarded the 2009 Joseph Black award from the Royal Society of Chemistry Analytical Division.  Education and early career  Barran went to Godolphin and Latymer School. She moved to the University of Manchester to study chemistry, graduating in 1994. She joined the University of Sussex for her graduate studies, working with Harry Kroto and Tony Stace.  Research and career  Barran stayed with Stace for three years after completing her PhD in 1998. In 2001 Barran joined the University of California, Santa Barbara, working as a postdoctoral fellow with Mike Bowers. She was interested in the structure and stability of small molecules in the gas phase. She looked at how Ion-mobility spectrometry could be used to identify conformation. Barran joined the University of Edinburgh as an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Advanced Research Fellow in 2002. In 2005 she was awarded the 10th Desty Memorial prize for her innovations in Separation Science. She was made a Senior Lecturer in 2009. She worked on mass spectrometry techniques that can be used to evaluate conformational change, aggregation and intrinsic conformation. She investigated mass spectrometry for therapeutics for pre-fibrillar aggregation. She helped to establish the Scottish Instrumentation and Resource Centre for Advanced Mass Spectrometry at the University of Edinburgh. This had an initial remit to provide proteomic analysis for the MRC Human Genetics Unit. In 2013 Barran was appointed to the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology as a Chair in Mass Spectrometry sponsored by Waters Corporation. She led an EPSRC platform grant to study the structure-activity relationships of Beta defensins. She works with Cait MacPhee, Garth Cooper and Tilo Kunath on neurodegenerative proteins,, and with several groups including Richard Kriwacki, Rohit Pappu and Gary Daughdrill to examine intrinsically disordered proteins. She works with several biopharmaceutical companies to apply new mass spectrometry techniques to new drug modalites including monoclonal antibodies. She also develops new mass spectrometry instrumentation. Her group looks at the structure of biological systems at a molecular level, studying them in the gas and solution phase as well as theoretically. They use electrospray ionization, mass spectrometry, ion mobility mass spectrometry native mass spectrometry and complementary solution based biophysical techniques. They are interested in a proteins structure and how it changes in an effort to relate that to their function. Ion-mobility spectrometry‚Äìmass spectrometry can be used to look at the temperature dependent rotationally averaged collision cross-section of gas-phase ions of proteins. In 2014 she was awarded a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant to study the interactions of proteins with other proteins. Barran serves on the editorial board of the International Journal of Mass Spectrometry. She was included in the page of Perditas created by Perdita Stevens.  Parkinson's disease  Barran has been working with Joy Milne to search for odorous biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. By smelling skin swabs, Milne can differentiate between people with and without Parkinson's disease. She identified changes in her husband's scent before he was formally diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which he died of in 2015. Barran uses mass spectrometry to identify the biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. The story was made into a BBC documentary The Woman Who Can Smell Parkinson's. Barran received ethical approval for her work of the skin metabolites of Parkinson's in 2015, allowing them to work with Parkinson's UK to conduct a larger study. In 2018 Milne travelled to the Tanzanian training centre APOPO to check whether she could smell Tuberculosis. Barran's work on Parkinson's is sponsored by The Michael J. Fox Foundation.

Despite not having a digital presence, a PDF of the printed newspaper is available weekly online. The Pine Cone celebrated its centennial edition in February 2015.  History  The Pine Cone was founded in 1915 by William Overstreet who proclaimed in the first four page edition of 300 copies, \\"we are here to stay!\\" Overstreet sold the paper in 1926 to J.A. Easton. In 1926 writer and activist Perry Newberry was the editor of the Pine Cone and successfully ran for the office of city trustee, the equivalent of mayor. By 1929 members of the local arts community were elected to the Carmel Board of Trustees at the same time and most notably approved city zoning ordinance 96 designed to protect the thriving artist colony from unchecked development and commercialization. Newberry was the paper's co-publisher until he sold it in 1935. There is a street in Carmel, ‚ÄúPerry Newberry‚Äù named after him. from Ella Winter page: \\"Carmel was sharply divided between conservative and liberal factions; the latter quickly coalesced around the Steffens, who publicly debated the most controversial topics. The Irish poet and folklorist Ella Young, as well as the local press, described the relaxed social intercourse in this counterculture world. In 1928 the Steffens helped to create The Carmelite, a publication that was offered as an alternative to the town‚Äôs somewhat stodgy local paper, the Carmel Pine Cone.\\" \\\\- search for linkages between Langston Hughes and Pine Cone / Robinson Jeffers Pine Cone publisher Allman Cook announced Aug. 21, 1969, that he‚Äôd sold the newspaper to John Mustard and Wayne Everton, owners and publishers of The Squire, a community weekly in Lafayette.

(from Carmel-by- the-sea page on the Pine Cone:) Veteran CBS and NBC network news producer Paul Miller became publisher in 1997. In 2005, after failing to convince city officials to rezone a potential site for the Pine Cone's operation, he moved the paper's production offices to Pacific Grove, while maintaining a reduced news staff in downtown Carmel. The last Carmel office was closed in 2009 so the paper is no longer made in Carmel.

He was a judge on the Anglesey and Chester circuits. Early life Broom Hall, SheffieldJessop was the fifth son of Francis Jessop, of Broomhall, Yorkshire and his wife Barbara Eyre, daughter of Robert Eyre of Highlow, Derbyshire. He was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1683 and was called to the bar in 1690. In 1691 he succeeded his father to Broom Hall. He married by licence dated 15 January 1697, Mary Darcy, daughter of James Darcy. Career Jessop was legal adviser to John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, on whose recommendation he first stood unsuccessfully for election at Aldborough in 1701. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Aldborough at the 1702 general election and again in 1705. In 1707, he was appointed a Justice of the Anglesey circuit. He was returned unopposed for Aldborough as a Whig in the 1708 general election. On 14 January 1709, he fought a duel in Hyde Park with William Levinz an opponent of the Duke, and was ‚Äòrun into the belly, but not dangerous‚Äô. He was returned unopposed as MP for Aldborough at the 1710 general election. After the Duke of Newcastle died in 1711, his widow disputed the will which left his estates to his nephew, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle. Jessop sided with Pelham and stood as a Whig on Pelham's interest for Aldborough in 1713 but was defeated by the Duchess.

Career Dismissal In August 2003, AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik, an additional judge of the High Court, issued a notice of query on the then IGP Haque while drawing contempt proceedings against five police personnel. According to Manik, a traffic policeman on duty did not salute, while his car passed in the Farmgate area in Dhaka earlier in June the same year. Haque, in his clarification letter, mentioned that \\"a traffic policeman on duty is not obliged to salute anybody but a discretion is left to him to pay compliment to anybody without risking traffic accident. The duty of a driver is to obey the direction of the traffic policeman and he has no right to conduct a research as to whether the direction given by the traffic policeman is right or wrong\\". This response triggered the High Court to put contempt charge against Haque himself. In January 2004, the High Court found Haque guilty of gross misconduct in the contempt case against the judge as well as the court and fined him Tk 2,000. Later on 8 December, he was convicted of contempt of court after the Supreme Court rejected his appeal petition against the conviction. According to the legal experts, Haque stood dismissed from service since the relevant law says, \\"a public servant loses job for committing offences punishable with death, transportation or imprisonment for a term exceeding six months or with fines exceeding Tk 1,000 or both.\\" Government removed Haque from the IGP position on 14 December 2004 and put Ashraful Huda as the acting IGP. Two days later, the government appointed Huda as the new IGP and the President of Bangladesh pardoned Haque by exempting him from the purview of Section 3 of Public Servants (Dismissal on Conviction) Ordinance, 1985. 2004 Dhaka grenade attack case In April 2004, Haque's term for the IGP office was extended for one more year. During his term, the incident of 2004 Dhaka grenade attack occurred in August 2004 that killed 19 and injured over 200 others. In October, Haque mentioned that \\"no international link has been found to the recent spate of bomb blasts\\", a claim that contradicted the government's one-member judicial commission, which hinted at the link of a \\"foreign enemy\\" to the attack. In July 2011, 30 people were added to the supplementary charge sheets of the grenade attack case which included Haque's name. Later in December, Haque had appealed to a Dhaka court to discharge him from the cases but it was rejected. In March 2012, Haque was charged for assisting the killers financially and administratively to execute the attack and faced up to life-term imprisonment. He was granted bail the next month. In October 2018, Haque and another former IGP, Ashraful Huda, were sentenced to two years in jail and fined Tk 50,000 for harbouring the offenders.

As of 2018, it is the third largest public pension plan in the nation, and holds $207.4 billion in assets. These assets are overseen by the New York State Comptroller's office and are held on behalf of more than one million members of the New York State and Local Retirement Systems (NYSLRS). As of March 31, 2018, its one-year return was 11.35%, however its 10-year return was 6.4%. In 2017, the fund was able to cover about 95% of the benefits it paid out. The fund paid out $11.45 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. Organization The fund is administered by the Office of the New York State Comptroller. As of 2018, the State Comptroller is Thomas P. DiNapoli. The Comptroller's office is headquartered in Albany, New York and employs more than 2,700 people with 8 regional offices and another office in New York City. Investment Fees In its 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), the state comptroller's office found that the pension fund spent $663.7 million on investment expenses and fees for the financial year ending March 31, 2018. Jonathan Trichter, a politician who ran for the state comptroller's office in 2018, claimed that the pension fund had historically paid out $6 billion in fees to hedge funds and private equity managers. Some critics of the pension fund argue that the fund would achieve a better and more affordable return for its investment by investing more of its assets in passively managed ETFs, to which the fund's administrator has publicly responded by stating that investments in hedge funds provide critically needed diversity. About 77% of the fund's assets are invested in public equity and fixed-income investments, with another $17.5 billion invested in private equities. Socially responsible investing The pension fund has made news for publicly warning companies with whom it holds investments for their private behavior. In August 2018, state comptroller DiNapoli sent a letter to McDonald's expressing concern for the welfare of the chicken used in their food products.

Kadir's conviction was a precedent setting court case for Indonesian law, as he was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a law that was passed after he had violated it. He was released from prison in 2010.  Biography  Kadir was born on the island of Bali, Indonesia. He later moved to Denpasar, where he claimed he worked as a tour guide. In the early 2000s he became involved with Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamic terror cell that operated in Indonesia. Kadir was described as the group's \\"local boy\\" on Bali; he met with members of the group twice, renting an apartment from them, hiring a car for members of the group, and personally driving members of the group to locations ‚Äî which later became targets for terror attacks ‚Äî in southern Bali. How much Kadir actually knew about the terror cell is in dispute, but the Indonesian government claimed that he helped the group scout locations for future terrorist attacks.Butt, Simon; Hansell, David. (2004). The Masykur Abdul Kadir Case: Indonesian Constitutional Court Decision No 013/PUU-I/2003 URL: https://www.federationpress.com.au/pdf/AJAL6(2)%20Butt.pdf On 12 October 2002, a series of bombs were detonated in Bali and Denpasar, killing 202 people in total. In the aftermath of the attack, the Indonesian government began a crackdown on terrorist activity inside the country; several members and affiliates of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, including Kadir. Kadir was proven to have met with three members of the terror group in the immediate aftermath of the blast, and was subsequently put on trial for aiding in an act of terrorism. Kadir claimed that he was a tour guide, and that his clients \\"Just happened to be\\" the bombers. No evidence was presented connecting Kadir to the assembly of the bombs used in the attack, and as such he was sentenced to 15 years in prison under Article 13(a) of Law No 15. After being sentenced, Kadir and his lawyers appealed his conviction and questioned the constitutionality of the ruling; this objection was raised as Article 13(a) (which had been passed in the immediate aftermath of the Bali bombings) had not yet been formulated when Kadir was arrested, and thus he was being charged for committing an act that was not yet illegal when he committed said act. Kadir won his appeal, and the matter was brought before the Constitutional Court of Indonesia. The court found by a margin of five to four that trying terrorist suspects under retroactive laws violated the Indonesian constitution (specifically Article 28(1)), but the court also noted that, as the Constitutional Court's decision itself could not operate retrospectively, Kadir would remain in prison to serve out his sentence. Kadir was released from prison in 2010 after serving 7 years of his 15-year sentence. In the years after his release, he took part in meetings between former terrorists and victims of terror attacks, adding that he hoped such meetings would aid in the healing process.

The completed watercolour captures a fleeting moment, and shows influence from the works of the French Impressionists that Zorn had seen while in Paris, but with an distinctively austere Scandinavian palette.

The reflective glassy surface of the water is rippling in a breeze, under cloudy grey skies.

This small territory is 25 km in length and 10 km wide and forms a small strip extending deep into Belgian Ardennes along the Meuse. Larger cities in the pointe de Givet include Revin, Fumay, and Givet.  Identity  The pointe de Givet formed around geographic, linguistic, and historic particularities: the enclosed valley was long under the sovereignty from the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge where dialects of Walloon were spoken.  Geography  The pointe de Givet is located on the western border of the Ardennes mountain range in the natural region of Ardennes. It is around 250 km2 and in the form of a point extending into Belgium and constitutes the most northern part of the French department of Ardennes. It corresponds to a ridge in the Ardennes plateau carved into the Meuse valley. Bounded to the north by the Condroz region, the pointe de Givet sits between the Fagne region to the west, the Famenne region to the east, and crosses the Calestienne region. The richness of the flora and fauna classified the region as a special protection zone in the Natura 2000 network. The choice to place the Chooz Nuclear Power Plant was motivated by the presence of the Meuse as a reservoir for cooling liquid. However, much of the territory surrounding the plant is not on French land. Cooperation agreements between the French and Belgian governments had to be made in the management of the power plant.  Flora and fauna  The pointe de Givet is known for its diverse flora and fauna. Almost the entirety of the pointe is classified as a special protection zone by the Natura 2000 network. Covered 80% by hilly forests and closed-off valleys (Meuse, Semois, Houille), the pointe de Givet hosts a diverse environment: * Wetlands: rivers, ponds, swamps, bogs, and wet forests and prairies. * A wide array of woods and forests: riparian, acidophile, boxwood, beech, oak * Hedges, bushes, prairies, heaths * Cliffs, caves, stony and rocky areas It is also a migratory stop and breeding, nesting, and hibernation ground for several threatened and protected species of birds.  Notable sights  * The Pointe de Givet Natural Reserve and its surroundings: dry grasses, heaths, boxwoods and rocky fields provide shelter for interesting species of reptiles, birds, bats, butterflies, and plants. * In the bogs between Les Hautes-Rivi√®res and Hargnies, Ardennes, several interesting species including the Eurasian beaver and Dactylorhiza sphagnicola. * The forests of the Semoy valley including, acidophile forests, rocky forests, acidophile rock gardens, riparian forests, submerged vegetation of great botanical and ornithological interest. * Rare forest groupings in the woody valley of the Houille.  Culture  Part of French Wallonia, the pointe de Givet was, before 1914, one of the three \\"Walloon\\" territories (where Walloon was spoken) outside of Belgian Wallonia alongside Luxembourgish Wallonia (in Doncols and Sonlez, nearly extinct) and Prussian Wallonia. Region of the Walloon language. While the inhabitants of the pointe no longer speak Walloon, some traces remain: in the town of Dinant the phrase \\"Vive Djivet pol'peket\\" can still be heard and in Givet one says \\"Bramin d'p√Æres min pon d'ka√ªres\\" (many stones but little money), alluding to the rocks steep slopes where military garrisons were built and still remain.

It was built from 1914 to 1915. The property is owned by Property NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site is known to have been built upon by the 1820s, although it is likely that, like the other ridges of The Rocks, it was occupied by the encampment of settlers in the first weeks of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. Terrace houses occupied the site from the s until the construction of the hotel complex in 1914. The original Australian Hotel, leased to John Murray, was situated at 116 Cumberland Street on land contained within the Observatory Hill Resumed Area. In 1907 plans were made to realign Cumberland Street which included the demolition of the hotel. In 1911, Murray made an application for the erection of a new hotel, to be built be either by the state government or himself. The site on the corner of Cumberland Street and Gloucester Street was chosen. In 1912, Murray was granted a lease for the new hotel, operative as of 1 January 1913. Prior to construction, however, the 50-year lease was transferred to Resch's Ltd. The residential buildings on the site were demolished by 1914 and construction of the new hotel completed towards the end of that same year. On 8 May 1914 the Municipal Council approved the construction of a two-storey hotel plus cellar and two shops adjoining (one in Cumberland Street and one in Gloucester Street), the plans having been prepared for and submitted to Council by Resch's Ltd. The structure was two storeys in height with brick walls and an iron roof. A basement, or cellar, was located beneath the split level saloon bar. Two shops were also built on the site, one of which (fronting Cumberland Street) was used as a grocery store. In 1915, Resch's Ltd sublet the hotel to John Upjohn who was later convicted of selling adulterated rum. Resch's Ltd merged with Tooth & Co. Ltd in 1931 and the lease was transferred to Tooth and Co. Ltd, with Upjohn remaining licensee until 1939. In 1948, the whole of the ground floor was renovated and in 1955, the hotel was reroofed. Upon the expiration of the 50-year lease in 1963, Tooth & Co. Ltd stayed on as monthly tenants. Under the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority Act of 1968, the hotel and surrounding area came under the jurisdiction of the Authority. There was only minor structural changes to the building and minor changes in the use of the building from 1929 to 1974. In 1991-1992 an extensive program of conservation works was carried out. The Cumberland Street shop was rebuilt within the existing shell after fire damage, using evidence from the Gloucester Street shop. The hotel and Gloucester Street shop required structural and fire safety upgrading, and the hotel's ground floor public rooms were refurbished. The exterior was repainted in the original 1920s colour scheme.Adapted from NSW Government Architect's Office. 2006SCRA Annual Report 1992 In 2018, it operates as the \\"Australian Heritage Hotel\\". Description The Australian Hotel is a two-storey building with basement, designed in an Italianate style with a brick exterior and iron- cladded roof. The hotel still retains many of its original features including the saloon bar, etched signage and pressed metal ceilings. The archaeological condition of the site is partly disturbed but otherwise well preserved.  Heritage listing  The Australian Hotel and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Its inclusion of the registers of the National Trust and National Estate demonstrate the esteem it is held in by the wider community. The Australian Hotel and shops has social significance in its traditional role as a meeting place and abode of working men within the Rocks area, and continues to provide the service for which it was designed to not only the local residents but also to visitors to the area. The Australian Hotel is significant as a largely intact example of the public houses that were built in The Rocks from the establishment of the Colony and part of a suite of buildings, which demonstrate changing social and drinking habits over time. It is also likely to have a high degree of social significance as a traditional meeting place and abode of working men within The Rocks area and it continues to provide the service for which it was designed. Its form and siting reflects the 1903 Hickson, Davis and Vernon planning scheme, designed to improve the hygiene and amenity of The Rocks inhabitants following the 1900 plague outbreak. It has landmark qualities on a prominent site at the corner of Cumberland and Gloucester Streets. The building is an attractive and well-resolved example of Edwardian hotel architecture, with quality finishes, fabric and details. The building has a high degree of intact fabric and details and integrity. The combination of hotel and shops in one architectural treatment and the two level bar demonstrates an innovative response to the characteristics of the site and the needs of the community at the time. The archaeological resources within the site are also highly significant. Relating to the occupation of the site prior to changes for the 1903 planning scheme and construction of the Hotel, they provide a rare opportunity in conjunction with other sites, to study an early and significant community in the development of Sydney and the State. NSW Government Architect's Office. 2006 Australian Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Australian Hotel is historically significant because the complex and site followed the precepts of the 1903 Hickson, Davis and Vernon planning scheme, designed to improve the hygiene and amenity of The Rocks inhabitants following the 1900 plague outbreak. The relocation of the hotel and the whole development provides evidence of the town planning principles and the prevailing concepts of public health and amenity of the period. The Australian Hotel is also historically significant because it provides evidence of past and current leisure activities in NSW. It is one of the last purpose built hotels in The Rocks. The building is an important remaining example of the public houses built in The Rocks from the establishment of the Colony. The Australian Hotel, in conjunction with these earlier hotels, is part a suite of buildings that demonstrate changing social and drinking habits over time. Substantially intact purpose-built hotels of this period are rare, as most have been altered as a result of changing licensing laws and drinking habits. The site's changing use reflects the urban, economic and social development of the area. The site also reflects the lifestyles of the working and lower middle classes during the early twentieth century. The site also is indicative of the consistent two-storey scale of the area, which predominated in the vicinity prior to construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The shop at 87 Gloucester Street is an almost intact example of an Edwardian shop. The whole building, designed in an Edwardian architectural idiom, remains highly intact and thus provides evidence of past tastes, customs and forms. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Australian Hotel is aesthetically significant because it has landmark qualities on a prominent site at the corner of Cumberland and Gloucester Streets. It makes a significant contribution to The Rocks precinct as a visual marker of post- resumption development along with the housing board terraces across the road. This is in contrast to earlier elements such as Susannah Place and the Cumberland/Gloucester Street Archaeological site. The building is an attractive and well-resolved example of Edwardian hotel architecture, with quality finishes, fabric and details. The building has a high degree of intact fabric and details and integrity and as such is relatively rare, as most hotels of this period have been altered as a result of revised licensing laws and changing drinking habits. In addition, the design of the building effectively solves the problems of its corner site and differing street levels. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Although not formally assessed, it is likely that the Australian Hotel has a high degree of social significance. This relates to its traditional role as a meeting place and abode of working men within The Rocks area. It continues to provide the service for which it was designed to not only the local residents but also to visitors to the area. The Australian Hotel and shops have social significance as an important feature in The Rocks Conservation area, and contributes strongly to the character of The Rocks. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Australian Hotel and site has technical/research significance because it demonstrates earlier forms of building practice. The site also contains highly significant archaeological remains from pre-Hotel occupation of the site. Rock-cut features and footings associated with the residential neighbourhood from settlement to have been found and retained beneath both the Hotel and shops. There is very high potential for further remains to be found. In conjunction with the adjoining Cumberland/ Gloucester Streets Archaeological Site, the remains add to an understanding of the community in this area and provide a rare opportunity for archaeological study of an early neighbourhood that is not possible in many other parts of Sydney and the State. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The combination of hotel and shops in one architectural treatment and the two level bar provided an innovative response to the characteristics of the site and the needs of the community at the time. The building has a high degree of intact fabric, details and integrity. Many hotels of this period have been altered as a result of revised licensing laws and changing drinking habits. The early archaeological resources within the site provide a rare opportunity, in conjunction with neighbouring sites, to study an early and significant community in the development of Sydney and the State. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Australian Hotel is representative of a type of building traditionally associated with a meeting place and abode for working men within the traditional mixed residential, industrial, commercial and maritime uses of The Rocks area.

It depicts a humorous scene in a tavern in Surinam, with many merchants and sea captains from Rhode Island enjoying themselves. It has been described as the first genre painting in American art history. The work was commissioned by the subjects while visiting the important trading ports in Surinam in the 1750s, probably for their own amusement. At the time, Greenwood was living in Surinam. The subjects in the painting include Nicholas Cooke, sitting at the table smoking a pipe, speaking to Esek Hopkins; Joseph Wanton who has passed out in a chair, and Stephen Hopkins is pouring a drink (perhaps rum punch) from a porcelain bowl onto Wanton's head; and another unidentified figure is vomiting into his pocket. Cook and Wanton were both later Governors of Rhode Island. Esek Hopkins was a commander in the Continental Navy from 1775 to 1778. Stephen Hopkins signed the US Declaration of Independence in 1776. Greenwood has also included a self-portrait, holding a candle by the doorway. Two unidentified sailors are dancing, while others are sleeping, smoking pipes, or playing cards. Among the white merchants are several dark-skinned servants, possibly slaves, wearing few clothes and carrying drinks in large bowls.

It was designed by the Tooth and Co. resident architects and built in 1921 by D. M. Mitchell. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The subject site is known to have been occupied from the early years of 1800, although it is likely that, like the other ridges of The Rocks, it was occupied by the encampment of settlers in the first weeks of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. Originally a residential area for the wealthier people in the colony, away from and above the hospital and its gardens, Meehan's 1807 plan shows a schematic shaded area representing buildings, although these are very sparse in the area of the site. The 1835 Russell Survey of Section 87 Town of Sydney shows part of the site, specifically allotment number 12, was owned by Andrew Coss whose pub, The Punch Bowl, was within the site curtilage between 1832 and 1834. It is thought that a hotel may have been there as early as 1816. Previously Coss had been the proprietor of a pub of the same name in Cambridge Street and after 1834 the license was transferred to Argyle Street. To the north, number 11 is owned by James and Ann Curtis. In 1864 The Sydney Sands Directory lists Peter Stanton, Grocer, James Harris and George Bainbridge, Master Mariner occupying the houses on the site and Doves plan of 1880 shows three houses, presumably the same ones, at 80-84 Cumberland Street. According to the Sands Directory, they were occupied by Charles William Heydon, Shipwright (80) and John Smith (84), number 82 being vacant. In the 1870s Belleek Terrace, which was mentioned in the Commission into Chinese gambling and corruption in the police force, occupied the site on Gloucester Walk and was not demolished until the beginning of World War I. By 1900, Charles Crichton, Storekeeper and Frank Duncan, Boot Maker are listed at 80 Cumberland Street, while 84 was occupied by John Byrnes and Walter L. Whetton was at 86, both of whom lived in the terraces until 1910. The 1901 Darling Harbour Resumption Plan shows block 285 as part of the estate of Francis Smith, Trustees John Powell and Fred K. Smith. At this time the depth of the site at its centre line between Cumberland and Gloucester Streets was only . Development as a hotel The current Glenmore Hotel is the second hotel in Cumberland Street to bear that name. The first Glenmore Hotel was located to the north of the current hotel on the western side of the street and had been condemned principally because of the imminent construction of the southern approaches to the Harbour Bridge. In April 1919 the Housing Board wrote to Tooth & Co that the hotel was \\"ruinous and dilapidated\\" and \\"the Board will be glad to know whether you would be prepared to treat for a 50-years [sic] building lease of the site occupied by this Hotel, as, if so, then we will be prepared to consider the same.\\" Tooth & Co accepted the offer of the new site next to the Argyle Cut and accepted the stipulation that the new building would cost more than . It appears that a contract was let for in late 1919 or early 1920 with a builder, D. M. Mitchell. By April 1920 the project had come to a halt due to the tardiness of the Water Board in relaying drains in the vicinity of the site. The Builder claimed damages for the delay but the claim was waived after a restructured contract had been agreed to in which Mitchell would not claim his 7.5% fee on the amount that the contract exceeded . To counter the extreme topography of the site bisecting the ridge between Millers Point and The Rocks, the cellars for the new building were cut to the level of Gloucester Street, effectively destroying the bulk of the archaeological evidence of any previous subdivisions and earlier buildings. By June 1921 the project was becoming sufficiently complete for Tooth & Co to accept a quotation from Bebarfald's Ltd for furnishing the hotel. It appears that the new hotel opened in July 1921 as the old Glenmore Hotel was handed over to the Housing Board on 5 July 1921. The final cost of the hotel is recorded as having been . Some of this information conflicts with that of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority.Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, 1979. Building Data Sheet BH/01 The subsequent history of the Glenmore Hotel has been fairly uneventful which is typical of other hotels in the Upper Rocks. A few licensees lost their license for in breach of legislation (e.g. trading after hours) and trade fell off during the depression, which coincided with the hotel's loss of clients when the houses opposite were demolished for construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Trade was also badly affected for a few years around 1952 when Cumberland Street was blocked off due to the unsafe nature of the bridge over Argyle Street (the bridge bearing similar cracks to the Glenmore Hotel itself). The fabric of the building remained remarkably intact until the 1950s when significant interior alterations were made, especially the removal of the canopy to the bar. The building suffered structural problems from the outset with a continual record of cracks to the walls and parapets which eventually led to the alterations made by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in 1973 when the tiled bar was shortened and in 1975 when the parapets were removed, the Cumberland Street balconies, the kitchen stairs and the roof top laundry were removed, and a reinforced concrete ring beam and metal handrail was installed to the top of the walls to restrain them. Another major exterior alteration is the painting of the south and east walls of the hotel, assumed to be done under SCRA.Robertson & Hindmarsh, 1992:14-16, 8-11. The hotel was refurbished in 2005.  Description  The Glenmore Hotel is a three-storey building with a brick facade and exterior and a plastered interior with a tiled wall dado to the public bar.  Heritage listing  The Glenmore Hotel and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Glenmore Hotel was constructed by prominent Sydney brewery Tooth & Co and was designed in the Inter-war Georgian Revival style of architecture by a Tooth & Co resident architect. The Hotel contributes to the historic, aesthetic and social values of the state significant precinct of The Rocks through its use, architectural style, building form, streetscape contribution and period of construction. The Glenmore Hotel is significant to the local area for its historic and aesthetic values. It is historically representative of changing hotel operations during the 20th century due to shifting legislation and drinking habits. These changes are embodied in the fabric of the building and are evident in the continuation of the original accommodation uses; the provision of additional facilities such as bathrooms; and the altering of redundant spaces, such as the former parlour, for new uses. The Hotel is historically associated with the prominent Sydney brewery Tooth & Co and its form, fabric and architectural style is representative of Tooths attempt to improve the image of hotels and drinking during the Inter-war period. Aesthetically, the Glenmore Hotel is representative of the Georgian Revival style of architecture that was popular during the Inter-war period for the reconstruction or remodelling of earlier hotels. The characteristic features of the hotel include face brick walling, rendered and painted details, external tiling, regular fenestration, symmetrical facade, and multi-paned sash windows. As with most hotels, the Glenmore Hotel has been altered with the removal of the original facade balconies, parapet and bar although, the internal spaces have remained largely intact. Glenmore Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Continuously occupied since it was built in 1921, the subject site offers a colourful and varied history of drinking and leisure activities of The Rocks during the 20th century. The changes in attitudes to drinking and the laws associated with it have been embodied in the very fabric of the building through the continuation of original uses such as accommodation; the provision of facilities such as additional bathrooms; and altering spaces for new uses as seen in the former parlour. The Glenmore Hotel, relocated and rebuilt during the Inter-war period, is associated with that phase of resumption and redevelopment in state significant The Rocks precinct. It is historically evident of the program of redevelopment taken to sanitise and improve living conditions in The Rocks. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Designed and later altered by Tooth & Co Brewers, the Glenmore Hotel is significant for its connection to one of Sydney's oldest brewing companies. Tooths was associated with numerous hotels in The Rocks including the Fortune of War Hotel, the ASN Hotels and the Australian Hotel. Consequently the company had a notable presence in The Rocks and contributed to the social and economic life of people in the area. The Glenmore Hotel is one of many hotels throughout NSW that were reconstructed or altered by Tooth & Co during the Inter-war period in an effort to present a more wholesome image of hotels, drinking and beer. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Constructed and designed by an unknown Tooth & Co architect the Glenmore Hotel is a representative example of a largely intact Inter-war Georgian Revival style hotel. Along with the Art Deco, Functionalist, and Free Classical styles of the period the Georgian Revival style was popular for new and modified hotels. The stylistic features of the Hotel include the use of face brick, rendered and painted details, regular fenestration, symmetrical fa√ßade, multipaned sash windows, parapet and pediments. The load bearing wall and timber floor construction is typical of the period. The employment of details is relatively utilitarian in comparison to excellent examples of the style but comparable to that of other Tooth & Co Hotels. The aesthetic integrity of the hotel has been diminished through alterations including the removal of the parapet and the fa√ßade balconies. The Glenmore Hotel makes a strong contribution to the streetscape and the urban morphology of state significant precinct of The Rocks owing to its form, details and materials. It employs elements in its design characteristic of hotels in The Rocks that were constructed or altered in the Inter-war period by Tooth & Co. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks is socially valuable for the esteem in which the place is held and the contribution to the identity of the wider Sydney community. As a place with a continuous and public use the Glenmore Hotel is considered to make a contribution to the social significance of the Rocks both for its built form as well as its use. The Glenmore Hotel is considered to have some social associations with local patrons and those who visit The Rocks for its public use and as a place of social interaction. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has moderate potential at the Gloucester Street frontage for the recovery of early housing and settlement remains especially deep features such as wells and cesspits. Excavations for four piers during the construction of the northern courtyard fire stairs exposed a section of the former Gloucester Street roadway and kerb. It was destroyed for the foundation of the stairs but it was presumed that further segments survive to the north and south. The site was significantly modified by excavating to the level of the Gloucester Street elevation for the construction of the existing hotel building and hence it is unlikely that significant archaeological deposits remain. Owing to the extent of disturbance of the site potential for indigenous archaeological artefacts at the site is considered to be low. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Together with the Australian Hotel and the Long's Lane complex of terraces the Glenmore Hotel is the last surviving pre-Harbour Bridge Building in Cumberland Street north of the Cahill Expressway and is therefore a remnant of the pre-1930 period of urban development in The Rocks.

Private collection Head IV, sometimes subtitled Man with a Monkey, is a 1949 painting by Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon, one of series of works made in 1949 for his first one-man exhibition at the Hanover Gallery, in London. It measures and is held in a private collection. The painting is part of a series of six works from the late 1940s depicting heads. Like Head III and Head V, Head IV is usually considered as an intermediate steps towards his Head VI (and Head IV is sometimes confused with the better known Head VI). The work depicts the upper half of a male figure in a suit, in a rear quarter view facing away from the viewer, in a space shrouded with vertical bands interpreted as curtains. The figure is possibly looking in a mirror, where a simian face looks back. Like Head III, it is painted in dark tones of grey and black on a beige ground with white highlights, which in this case pick out the man's shirt collar, his neck, ear and temple. The placing of the two heads suggest the man is dissolving into the monkey, although the man is sometimes described as having a monkey on his shoulder; the low contrast between the elements have been likened to a cinematic dissolve. It may be based on a photograph. Bacon's six Head paintings were first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery in 1949, alongside four other important early works by Bacon: Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, Figure in a landscape, Study from the Human Body and Study for Portrait (also known as Man in a Blue Box).\\"Exhibition catalogues: A chronological selection of solo and group exhibition catalogues from the MB Art Collection. \\".

Since 15 people were onboard at the time of the crash, it is believed that there are no survivors. Crash At approximately 10:02 AM, the bus, traveling at 51 km/h, turned into the opposite lane and smashed through the safety barriers on the side of the bridge before plunging into the river. Initial reports indicated that the bus had swerved to avoid an oncoming vehicle; however, footage recovered from the bus shows that a female passenger had attacked the driver, who retaliated. Local police have said the fight was the cause of the crash. Police said in a statement that the pair began arguing when the driver refused to let her off the bus after she missed her stop. The footage shows the pair gesturing at each other before the woman hits the driver in the face with her mobile phone. Chinese authorities were able to eventually determine what happened based on the vehicle's black-box recording, witness accounts and other surveillance videos along the bus route. Recovery Divers have recovered 13 bodies following a large rescue operation using a floating crane to recover the wreckage. Two people remain missing.

The Ron Santa Teresa is known for its products and its social projects through the Santa Teresa Foundation, such as ', Rugby Santa Teresa and Proyecto Casas Blancas. The seat of the company is located at the Santa Teresa Estate, founded in 1796 by the Earl Mart√≠n Tovar Ponte, where it currently is an agroindustrial, touristic and sports complex.  History  At the end of the 16th century sugar cane was already being grown in the valleys of the modern day Aragua state, in the north of Venezuela. In 1796 Count Mart√≠n Tovar Ponte, signer of the Venezuelan Act of Independence, named the terrain in honor of the ‚ÄúSanta Thereza‚Äù patroness. After the property suffered damage caused by the royalists during the War of Independence, a young man of German descent Gustav Julius Vollmer Ribas, grandson of the general Jos√© F√©lix Ribas, bought the property and started to produce the first Venezuelan rum in 1896.

The program started in 2003, after a robbery to the company where a security guard was almost killed. One of the robbers was captured and offered to work for the company for three months as sentence. Another member was captured afterwards and made the same offer, until twenty-two members of the gang joined; they were taught how to read and write. Although the original idea was that the gang members worked in the state, its owner, Vollmer, had the idea of rehabilitating them with rugby. The program has had over two hundred participants and has expanded to include a rugby school program as well as a communitarian one, with a total of at least two thousand young people that train rugby in the state to move away from crime.

Jacqueline Pirenne, an expert on Semitic languages, was able to use inscriptions of the site to determine how the visual depiction of Old South Arabian letters changed over time.  Temple  The elliptical temple site is in a poor state of preservation; the temple itself lies in rubble. Only the remains of the foundations give any clue of the building's appearance. The Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry, who first described the temple, was able to show that it had been a rectangular structure, of a sort with many parallels. This rectangular peristyle surrounded a courtyard, with a cella on one side. Offerings were placed in the courtyard (see RES 2771 and 2774).Maria H√∂fner, \\"S√ºdarabien\\" in Dietz Otto Edzard, G√∂tter und Mythen im Vorderen Orient (W√∂rterbuch der Mythologie), pp. 544 f. (online) The whole complex was surrounded by a stone peribolos wall measuring 100 x 37 metres. On the front side of this, there were three entrances. The middle one of these entrances was given special emphasis by a pillared propylon.J√ºrgen Schmidt, Alts√ºdarabische Kultbauten, pp. 84‚Äì87; 98 f. The ground plan and form of the structure reflect the prototype of the Sabaean temple building. The temple was an active religious site for centuries, so it frequently had to be renovated and modified in response to new trends. In the course of time, ornamental elements were added, such as floral compositions and elements influenced by foreign practices. The temple would have contained over-life-size, metal animal sculptures, as well as votive gifts and dedications in the form of inscribed stelae and other figural images.

Eremias intermedia is also known as the Aralo-Caspian racerunner. Taxonomy and conservation It was described by William Thomas Blanford in 1875. The type locality is near Isfahan, Iran. The specific epithet persica refers to its distribution in Persia (now known as Iran). Eremias nigrolateralis Rastegar-Pouyani & Nilson, 1998, the black-sided racerunner, was described based on dorsal color patterning differences but is now considered a synonym of E. persica. E. nigrolateralis was considered a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List based on its extensive, suitable habitat, large population, and presumed lack of significant threats. It was considered \\"unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category\\". E. persica has not been separately assessed on the IUCN Red List. Description It is most closely related to Eremias velox, of which it was previously treated as a subspecies, and they share several attributes such as having a wide range distribution across the Iranian Plateau, as well as the number of and shape of their scales. It can be morphologically distinguished from E. velox based on several characteristics, including: * continuous dorsolateral black stripes (vs. E. velox with interrupted, forming ocelli with white spots), * the stripes strongly contrasting with the base pattern (vs. not strongly contrasting), * juveniles with 4 dark stripes on the back between dorsolateral white-spotted stripes (vs. 3 dark stripes), and * juveniles with ventral surface of tail not red (vs. carmine red in E. velox). Like many other lacertid lizards, the juveniles are more easily distinguished from other species than the adults. Other closely related species of Eremias racerunners include E. kopetdaghica, E. isfahanica, E. lalezharica, E. montana, E. papenfussi, E. strauchi, and E. suphani. Distribution and habitat The Persian racerunner occurs in Iran, southern Azerbaijan, southern Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and western Pakistan. In Iran, Eremias persica has a broad distribution in the central plateau south of the Alborz Mountains, including the Zagros Mountains, but it is absent from the central deserts Dasht-e Lut and Dasht-e Kavir.

Poems was a quarto volume of poetry by Wilfred Owen published posthumously by Chatto and Windus in 1920. Owen had been killed on 4 November 1918. It has been described as \\"perhaps the finest volume of anti-war poetry to emerge from the War\\". The published volume included a sepia-toned photograph of the author in military uniform. It was edited by Owen's friend Siegfried Sassoon, with assistance from Edith Sitwell. Sassoon also wrote an introduction, including the words \\"The poems printed in this book need no preliminary introduction ‚Ä¶ All that was strongest in Wilfred Owen survives in his poems\\". The preface was found, in an unfinished condition, among Wilfred Owen's papers. The slim book was sold for six shillings. It included 23 poems, including some of his most famous work, such as including \\"Anthem for Doomed Youth\\" and \\"Dulce et Decorum Est\\". Only five of his poems had been published before his death, three in The Nation, and two in The Hydra. Seven were published by the Sitwells in 1919, in their annual anthology Wheels. Owen's reputation as a war poet was quickly established immediately after the end of the war.

She was the first woman to be awarded the degree of Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences. TSB  Biography  Born in Moscow to a military family, she received her initial education at home under the guidance of her mother, the French, Yulia Lvovna, who taught her foreign languages and aroused her interest in scientific pursuits.When the first large popular science book of Vera Aleksandrovna ‚ÄúThe Origin and Structure of the Earth‚Äù was published in 1945, the author wrote: ‚ÄúIn memory of my mother, Yulia Lvovna Varsanofyeva, my first teacher of astronomy and geology, which aroused my interest in studying of nature. \\" Varsanofieva spent most of her childhood in Ryazan, according to the duty station of her father. At the age of 13, she entered the Mariinsky Women's Gymnasium in Ryazan. In 1906, she graduated with a gold medal. At 14 years old, Varsanofieva told her parents that she would be a geologist. In the gymnasium, the sister of the future professor-geologist A. D. Arkhangelsky became a classmate and friend of Varsanofieva. To supplement her education in mathematics and history, she began to attend the 8th grade at the V. P. Cimicky private gymnasium. In 1907, she entered the physics and mathematics department of the Higher Women's Courses in Moscow. At this time, geologists A. P. Pavlov, A. A. Chernov, and A. B. Misana taught here. In the summer of 1911, Professor A. A. Chernov organized the first excursion to the Northern Urals for students, and thus V. A. Varsanofyeva first came to the area, which later became the site of her many years of geological research. In 1915, Varsanofieva passed the state exams at the First State Testing Commission at the Moscow Higher Women's Courses and was left at the geology department of these courses ‚Äúto prepare for a professorship‚Äù. In 1916-1919, she taught at the Moscow Prechistenskii working courses. In 1918, as an assistant, she gave lectures on geology and mineral resources at the Moscow Higher Courses for Women, and then at Moscow State University in the Department of A. P. Pavlov. Since 1920, as an assistant professor at the 1st Moscow State University, she read the first special tectonics course in Moscow. In 1919‚Äì24 she taught at the Tver Pedagogical Institute, at the Ivanovo-Voznesensky Pedagogical and Polytechnic Institutes. In 1921‚Äì1924, she conducted research, mainly in the mountainous belt of the Northern Urals. In 1925 she was briefly arrested. In 1925-1956 she taught at the 2nd Moscow State University (from 1930 - MGPI them. V. I.

Susan Monica, Residence, Rogue River, Oregon, United States. is an American convicted murderer. She garnered public attention after being convicted of murdering two men at her residence in rural Wimer, Oregon. Both of the victims had worked as handymen on her farm, and each had gone missing under mysterious circumstances in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In both cases, Monica dismembered the victims before feeding portions of their remains to her farm pigs. Partial remains of the two men were discovered at her residence after authorities interrogated her for identity theft of one of the men. After a trial that lasted six days, Monica was sentenced to 50 years in prison for her crimes in April 2015. Background Susan Monica, who owned a farm in rural Wimer, Oregon, employed 59-year-old Stephen Dellecino as a handyman on the property. Dellecino disappeared some time in 2012 under mysterious circumstances. The following year, Robert Haney, a 56-year-old handyman, also disappeared in September 2013. Investigation Authorities arrived at Monica's residence on January 10, 2014, after it was discovered she had been using Haney's food stamps card, and confronted her with fraud charges. Upon searching her residence, they discovered evidence of human remains, which prompted a full search of the property. Portions of remains from a total of two individuals were discovered; the first belonged to 56-year-old Robert Haney, Monica's handyman, who had gone missing in September 2013. The second individual initially was unidentified, but was later determined to be Dellecino, a former employee of Monica's who had gone missing in 2012. The state of Monica's property was squalid, with significant piles of garbage, animal bones, and no running water or sewage system. Investigators spent three weeks searching Monica's farm near Rogue River, digging over 50 holes in the land searching for additional evidence and other potential victims. No additional remains were uncovered in their search. The pigs Monica kept on the farm were subsequently euthanized, and a former resident claimed he had witnessed Monica feed deceased house pets and livestock to the pigs on different occasions. Upon interviewing Monica, detectives found she gave varying explanations as to how both men died, claiming both that Delicino had shot himself repeatedly in the head in 2012, and that she had also shot him in self-defense, after which her pigs began to eat portions of his body. Monica claimed to have buried the remnants of his corpse after finding the pigs consuming him. In regard to Haney, Monica claimed he had disappeared from her farm in the summer of 2013. She stated she later came upon him as her pigs were disemboweling him, and that she shot him to death to ease his suffering. Monica subsequently expressed uncertainty over whether Haney was dead when she shot him. Some of Haney's remains were found in plastic bags in Monica's barn. During her video-taped interrogation, which was later used in the trial, Monica stated: \\"I do not value human life very much. My feeling is the only thing wrong with the planet is there's people on it. If not for us, all the other animals, even dodo birds, would be here.\\" Trial and conviction Monica pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder, abuse of a corpse, and identity theft. Monica, despite having representation, chose to cross-examine Eric Henderson, the case's lead investigator. During the trial, an Oregon State Police anthropologist testified that Haney's legs had been dismembered with an ax, and that his thigh bones showed signs of \\"being gnawed on by an animal.\\" The anthropologist stated it was unclear whether Haney had been dead prior to dismemberment of his legs. It was also stated by the anthropologist that Delicino had suffered three to four gunshot wounds to the head. Another witness who had been in jail with Monica testified that she had received a birthday card from her signed \\"from the sweetest murderer in Jackson County.\\" On April 21, 2015, Monica was convicted on all counts after six days of testimony and only one hour of jury deliberations.

It is scheduled to take place on November 22, 2020 at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. It will be the 34th event under the Survivor Series chronology and will feature WWE's virtual fan viewing experience called ThunderDome. Production Background Survivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view, produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, dubbed the \\"Big Four\\".Ian Hamilton. Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition (p. 160) The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Since WWE reintroduced the brand split in 2016, Survivor Series has centered around competition between Raw and SmackDown for brand supremacy. In September 2019, NXT, previously a developmental territory exclusive to the WWE Network, debuted on the USA Network, solidifying its status as WWE's third major brand, and was subsequently added to the brand competition theme. The 2020 event will be the 34th event under the Survivor Series chronology. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, WWE presented the majority of its programming from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida since mid-March with no fans in attendance, although in late May, the promotion began using Performance Center trainees to serve as the live audience, which was further expanded to friends and family members of the wrestlers in mid-June. On August 17, WWE announced that all future shows and pay-per-views would be held at the Amway Center, a larger venue also located in Orlando, for the \\"foreseeable future\\", beginning with the August 21 episode of SmackDown. Furthermore, the shows now feature a new fan viewing experience called \\"ThunderDome\\", which utilizes drones, lasers, pyro, smoke, and projections. Approximately one thousand LED boards were installed in the Amway Center to allow fans to virtually attend the events for free and be seen on the rows and rows of LED boards. Arena audio is also mixed with that of the virtual fans so that chants from the fans can be heard. WWE's initial agreement with the Amway Center expired on October 31, but with the option to extend the contract with a two weeks notice. On October 12, PWInsider revealed that the contract was extended until the end of November.  Storylines  The show will comprise matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results are predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brands, while storylines are produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw, Friday Night SmackDown, and NXT.

Boas (ed.), The Crusader World (London & New York: Routledge) pp. 289‚Äì308, at 294. Doubt has recently arisen over whether Phokas was in fact the author of the Ekphrasis, which has been re- attributed instead to John Doukas.According to Charis Messis (2011), \\"Litt√©rature, voyage et politique au XIIe si√®cle: L'Ekphrasis des lieux saints de Jean 'Phokas',\\" Byzantinoslavica 69 (3), pp. 146‚Äì66, this work has been misattributed to Phokas. Its real author was John Doukas, who went on an imperial mission to the Holy Land in 1177. See Shay Eshel, The Concept of the Elect Nation in Byzantium (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 155. Little biographical information about Phokas is available. One manuscript of the Ekphrasis contains a note stating that he was a priest and that his father, a certain Matthew, became a monk on Patmos. According to this marginal note, his trip to the Holy Land took place in either 1177 or 1195. He is known to have accompanied Emperor Manuel I (reigned 1143‚Äì80) on an expedition to the sea off Attaleia (now Antalya). He may be the same person as the Focas who, according to the Annales Herbipolenses, was sent by Manuel in 1147 to guide the crusading army of King Conrad III of Germany from Nicaea to Iconium. Phokas's Ekphrasis is both concise and precise. He had a rather positive attitude towards the Crusaders. In some cases he provides unique information. He describes a fanatical Saracen sect called the Chasisioi (perhaps the Assassins). He calls the river Jordan \\"the holiest among rivers\\" and names three monasteries in the vicinity of site of the baptism of Jesus dedicated to Our Lady of Kalamon, John Chrysostom and John the Baptist. The latter was rebuilt, he says, by Manuel I. He also reports that Cana was nothing more than a kastellion (a small fortified settlement), that there were two monasteries (one Greek, one Latin) atop Mount Tabor, and that the site of ancient Jericho was covered in gardens and vineyards. Besides the Bible, Phokas also quotes from such ancient authors as Josephus Flavius and Achilles Tatius. The Ekphrasis may have been written against the pilgrimage account of Constantine Manasses, who returned from the Holy Land disillusioned and wondering why Christ lived there. In the Ekphrasis, the beauty of the places is stressed repeatedly.

Name The name Wugu was derived from the nearby temple name. It represents the Chinese agriculture with the meaning of \\"five grains\\", which are rice, wheat, corn, bluesteam grass and beans. History The center was originally established in 1987 as a ceramic manufacturing company under the name Gong Hsun Enterprise Co. () by renting a courtyard house as their factory facility. Many of its products were exported to the United States and Europe. Due to the growing demand of their products, the factory had to be relocated to its present location in 1990 and more of its manufacturing process became automated. Along the way, the founder decided to turn the company into a tourism factory. The factory was redesigned to suit tourist visits. The center was then opened in 2000 under the name Wugu Cultural Village. After the signing of Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement on 29 June 2010 between Mainland China and Taiwan, the center faces tougher competition from the cheaper mainland products. In 2011, the center requested assistance from the Industrial Technology Research Institute. Subsequently, the center signed a technology transfer agreement with the institute and started to modify parts of the center facilities to manufacture ceramic knives. Architecture The center spans over an area of 1.55 hectares and divided into seven sections in a Hakka architectural style, which are Bamboo Rice Pavilion, Granary Pavilion, Hakka Cultural Relics Pavilion, Silk Pavilion and Smoked Pottery Garden. It also features a souvenir shop. Exhibitions The center is the combination of industry, economy and culture-themed tourism. It showcases the traditional ceramics industry, Hakka rice and silk artworks from its 200 ceramic products display. It exhibits the tools used by farmers and daily utensils used by local residents. The center is decorated with various kinds of pottery urns at its yards. Activities The center offers hands-on activities, such as ceramic paintings, cookie, ground tea, Hakka snacks and Hakka baozi making. Visitors The center currently receives around 400,000 visitors annually. Transportation The center is accessible from Tongluo Station of Taiwan Railways Administration.

She graduated from high school in Okayama and entered Kwansei Gakuin University to study German literature, but later changed her focus and graduated with a degree in Japanese literature. After graduation she worked as a graphic designer and married her husband, then worked in a series of art direction and curation jobs, including five years at the Japanese conglomerate Itochu, while also attending graduate school in art history at Waseda University. Harada subsequently worked as an art curator for the Mori Art Museum, including a collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art, but left in 2002 to work as a freelance art curator.  Career  Harada made her literary debut in her early 40s. Her first novel, ', won the inaugural Japan Love Story Grand Prize, awarded to a newcomer writing in the love story genre, and was published in 2006 by Takarajimasha, the prize's sponsor. It sold over 370,000 copies. The book was later adapted into a 2009 Yu Nakai film of the same name starring Maiko and Tetsuji Tamayama. After her debut Harada wrote several more novels that were subsequently adapted for film and television. Her 2007 novel ' was later adapted into 2014 film of the same name, made in Taiwan and released nationwide in Japan.

Her 2011 novel ', about a broken friendship between two high school girls living in Okayama in 1980 who meet again thirty years later, was later adapted into a 2015 Akiko Ohku film starring Rika Adachi and Mio Y≈´ki. In 2012 Shinchosha published Harada's novel ', a story about a disgraced art curator asked to help with negotiations for a painting whose provenance she previously investigated. Rakuen no kanvasu won the 25th Yamamoto Sh≈´gor≈ç Prize. Later that year the book was nominated for the 147th Naoki Prize, but the prize went to Mizuki Tsujimura. Harada was nominated twice more for the Naoki Prize without winning. In 2013 Harada's novel ', a work of historical fiction that tells stories about French painters Claude Monet, Henri Matisse, Edgar Degas, and Paul Cezanne from the perspective of women in their lives, was nominated for the 149th Naoki Prize. Her 2016 suspense novel ', a thriller about the return of Picasso's Guernica to the Museum of Modern Art that combines a fictionalized historical account of French photographer Dora Maar with an entirely fictional narrative about an art curator in New York City following the September 11 attacks, was nominated for the 155th Naoki Prize.

Independence had been sailing from Bayonne to New York with a cargo of brandy, silks, etc. Although British records report that she was a privateer, she was at best a letter of marque, though she does not appear in a compendium of American privateers and letters of marque. Career and loss Her first commander, in 1813 to 1814, was Lieutenant J. Jullan. Lieutenant Henry Freeman Young Pogson replaced Jullan. She underwent small repairs at Plymouth between January and August 1813. The Marquis of Wellington requested a naval demonstration on 10 November 1813 at Socoa in the rear of the French lines of communication. Admiral Keith dispatched four vessels to Saint-Jean-de-Luz: , , , and Racer. However, the swell was so heavy that the naval vessels could do little beyond exchanging fire with the shore batteries there. Fate Racer was cruising off the southern American coast when a large privateer chased her. Racer escaped but when Pogson decided to return to Jamaica she wrecked on the Cay Sal Bank in the Florida Straits. Pogson got his men on to the Cay.

The disease is named from the primary inflammatory process, wherein lymphocytes are seen within the esophageal mucosa. Symptoms of the condition include difficulty swallowing, heartburn and food bolus obstruction. The condition was first described in 2006 by Rubio and colleagues. Initial reports questioned whether this was a true medical disorder, or whether the inflammation was secondary to another condition, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. The cause of lymphocytic esophagitis is unknown. The disease may cause different symptoms and be caused by different processes in childhood as compared to adulthood. Some studies have shown that it is associated with either other medical conditions involving the esophagus, including gastroesophageal reflux disease and achalasia, or other inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, and allergic conditions. The diagnosis is based upon a biopsy of the mucosa of the esophagus, showing a characteristic appearance of inflammation involving lymphocytes, and the relative absence of another group of inflammatory cells, granulocytes. Complications of the disorder include stricture of the esophagus, which can lead to food bolus obstruction, and weight loss. Treatment of lymphocytic esophagitis includes medications meant to target the esophagus topically, such as budesonide, but also procedures to deal with complications, such as esophageal dilation. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of lymphocytic esophagitis is dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, prevalent in 53 to 57% of individuals with the condition due to inflammation, narrowing or altered movement of the esophagus. Other symptoms include heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea and food bolus obstruction. Some patients may have no symptoms, as was found in a significant percentage of patients in the first description of the condition, although more recent reports indicate that the absence of symptoms is uncommon. Complications Image of a piece of food obstructing the esophagus, a complication in lymphocytic esophagitis Food bolus impaction is a common complication of lymphocytic esophagitis. This occurs when food is acutely obstructing the esophagus at an area of narrowing. It typically requires an endoscopic procedure in order to remove or dislodge the obstructing food. Cause The cause of lymphocytic esophagitis is unknown. Attempts to better understand the cause of lymphocytic esophagitis include identification of other diseases that associate with the condition. These conditions include other esophageal conditions including gastroesophageal reflux disease and achalasia, as well as other inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, and allergic conditions such as eczema. Additionally use of tobacco may associate with lymphocytic esophagitis. Lymphocytic esophagitis does not occur with high frequency in other gastrointestinal conditions where lymphocytosis is found in the mucosa, including lymphocytic colitis and lymphocytic gastritis; however, there is a disease association with coeliac disease wherein lymphocytic inflammation occurs in the small bowel after exposure to gluten. Pathophysiology Little is known about the pathophysiology of lymphocytic esophagitis. It has been hypothesized that lymphocytic esophagitis may be either a primary inflammatory disorder, or that the inflammation is triggered by an external stimulus leading to injury of the mucosal lining of the esophagus, such as gastric acid in GERD. Diagnosis Endoscopic image of lymphocytic esophagitis, demonstrating narrow lumen esophagus (left), linear furrows (right) and esophageal rings (right) The diagnosis of lymphocytic esophagitis is made by biopsy of the mucosal lining of the esophagus. This is typically achieved at the time of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a medical procedure wherein an endoscope is inserted through the mouth, into the esophagus, in order to visualize and biopsy the mucosa. While the histologic changes in the biopsies are characterized by the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate, consisting primarily of lymphocytes in the absence of other inflammatory cells such as granulocytes, the criteria for making the diagnosis are still unclear. The location of the biopsies, cutoff of number of lymphocytes found in each high- power field of view of the microscope, the presence of spongiosis, and the need for immunohistochemical staining to define lymphocytes are all unclear still. While the diagnosis of lymphocytic esophagitis depends on the biopsy results, certain changes can be visualized directly at the time of endoscopy. The esophagus may be narrow in calibre, may show multiple rings, redness, linear furrows or the mucosal lining may slide demonstrating a \\"crepe-paper\\" appearance. Complications such as strictures of the esophagus can also be detected with endoscopy. These changes are very similar to those found in eosinophilic esophagitis, a more common and better understood esophageal disorder thought to be of allergic origin. Narrow-band imaging with magnification endoscopy is another imaging modality that can show characteristic changes of lymphocytic esophagitis. Management The treatment of lymphocytic esophagitis is still undefined. Treatment either targets symptoms, inflammation or complications. For example, heartburn is a symptom in lymphocytic esophagitis, and proton pump inhibitors, which reduce acidity in the stomach, are consequently used for treatment. With respect to treatment of inflammation, steroids that are topical and coat the lining of the esophagus, such as budesonide have been used to treat the condition, in one German study. Prednisone has also been used to treat the inflammation of lymphocytic esopahgitis. With respect to complications, strictures of the esophagus can be treated with esophageal dilation. Prognosis There has been little studied about the natural history of lymphocytic esophagitis. The longest study of the condition involved a median follow-up of 3.3 years, wherein participants were surveyed, and demonstrated that 87% of patients were alive but that the vast majority (97%) of patients still had symptoms. There have been two reports of esophageal perforation associated with the condition, one case occurring during endoscopic treatment of complications. Epidemiology The percentage of individuals with lymphocytic esophagitis is uncertain. Early studies indicated that the prevalence was 0.1% in adults. However, reports in children indicate a higher prevalence of 8.5%, perhaps suggestive of incidental findings of lymphocytes in endoscopies performed for other reasons. The disease may occur more frequently in women over the age of 60. There is increasing awareness of lymphocytic esophagitis among physicians, perhaps affecting the prevalence over time. The majority of the studies on lymphocytic esophagitis are after 2015. History The condition was first described in a series of 20 patients at the Karolinska Institutet by Carlos Rubio in 2006. Much of the reports of the condition over the subsequent several years were focused on ascertaining whether lymphocytic esophagitis was a true condition, and if it was, establishing uniform criteria for its diagnosis. Research The majority of the research into lymphocytic esophagitis has been performed after 2015. There remain many questions unanswered about the condition, such as establishing its natural history, clarifying its diagnostic criteria, and ascertaining the best treatment for the condition.

It was designed by the Tooth & Co. resident architect and built in 1922 by H. J. & H. W. Thompson. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site of the Fortune of War was originally part of the first hospital, erected in 1788. By 1790 the original tent hospital had been replaced by a portable hospital which came out with the Second Fleet. After the Rum Hospital opened in 1816 in Macquarie Street the buildings on George Street were demolished and the site became an early quarry. Ownership by Samuel Terry The site of the Fortune of War was formalised in the survey of the township carried out in the early 1830s, the site was classified as Lot 7 of City Section 84, comprising an area of 1 rod 15 perches. In January 1841 the allotment was officially granted to the trustees, executrix and executors of the estate of the emancipist Samuel Terry, these being Rosetta Terry (widow), John Terry Hughes (nephew and son-in-law), Tom White Melville Winder of Windermere (family friend and long standing business acquaintance) and James Norton (solicitor). Terry's interest in the site seems to date from at least when an area of \\"26 rods\\" situated on the \\"west side of George Street\\" was leased to Terry for the term of 21 years. Terry arrived in Sydney in 1801 on a seven-year sentence convicted of theft. He was eventually described as the \\"Botany Bay Rothschild\\" and at his death in 1838 left a personal estate of , an annual rental income from his Sydney properties of and \\"land and property which defies assessment\\". Terry's business interests included brewing and he was occasionally a publican. On the site of the Fortune of War, Terry constructed a terrace of three buildings (today's 139-143 George Street) completed in the mid to late 1820s. The footprint of this building, a terrace of three with a breakfront is marked in the Robert Russell survey of 1834. Conversion as a hotel The building was constructed as a Public House known as \\"The Fortune of War\\". The first recorded licensee of the public house was John Boreham in 1830 for the sale of wines, malt and liquor. Many publicans were former artisans such as stonemasons, like Boreham, a former miller. In the 1822 Land and Stock Muster Boreham was listed as a miller in government employ on a 14-year sentence. 1828 he was listed in the census as a former convict who arrived in Sydney in 1815 on the \\"Marquis of Wellington\\" and employed at that time as a dealer. From 1833 the publican of the Fortune of War was Walter Nottingham Palmer, where he remained until 1839 when he took over the licence of the New York Tavern, also on George Street. In 1844 the lease of the Fortune of War was renewed by Robert White Moore, although he had held the licence from 1842. The lease was again renewed in 1851 for a further seven years. During this period Moore held a late-night (midnight) licence. In 1861 Moore acquired the freehold ownership of the property through a purchase from Thomas Smart. Smart's interest in the property originated from a mortgage taken out in 1851 and the partition of the Terry Estate made in 1860. Robert White Moore continued to hold the licence for the hotel up until the time of his death in 1870 when it passed to his relatives. Thomas Moore held it for the 1870 and 1880s and his nephew Benjamin Robert Moore for the 1890s. During this period the hotel was managed by the following publicans: * 1873-Mrs Frances Cowell * 1879-1880Alexander Yeend * -1893Arthur Buchanan * 1894James Irving * 1895James McGuire * 1896William Biscoff * 1897-1899Hector Allen Bogle * 1900Archibald Laing The commercial success of The Fortune of War is indicated by the continual licensing of the premises from at least 1830. Resumption by the NSW Government The bubonic plague broke out on the waterfront in January 1900, prompting the Government to resume the entire Rocks and Millers Point area. Large scale demolitions followed and the area was administered by the Sydney Harbour Trust, then the Maritime Services Board and in 1970 The Rocks was handed to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. The Fortune of War continued to trade until 1920 when Tooth & Co Ltd entered into a head-lease with the Sydney Harbour Trust for 45 years. Shortly after this the 19th century building was demolished and the extant hotel constructed. The first month of trading in the new building was in December 1921. In March 1976 Tooth & Co relinquished their head lease to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. Since that date leases have been granted to the following publicans: * 1978-1987 John Walker Hook and * 1987‚Äìpresent (2009) Robert John Keyes. Keyes was also one of the lessees of the Russell Hotel at 143 George Street and the operation of the two properties merged at this time. The Fortune of War Hotel with its longstanding licence and retention of original bar and fittings contributes to The Rocks as a unique historic neighbourhood.  Description  The Fortune of War Hotel is a three-storey face brick building with stucco detailing, of which much remains. It shows the Californian Bungalow style as applied to a commercial hotel building.Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1999: 59 The building has three levels to George Street and a modern rear addition, built in a traditional style. The building has a central recessed balcony on the first floor and a parapet wall to the street. There is an awning over the footpath, typical of those along George Street. Externally, to George Street, original wall tiles, face brickwork, rendered trim, and terrazzo thresholds remain intact. Timber doors and windows appear in good condition. Internally, the general layout of public areas appears original, including features such as wall tiles, ceilings, central bar and other joinery. The original stair to upper level bedrooms remains, but is blocked off. The rear area is a half level above the George Street ground floor level. There appears to be no above ground evidence of the original building on the site. The existing building (built by 1922) is relatively intact. There have been major changes upstairs, with links to the Russell Hotel.

History View of the earlier lighthouse, 1864 The lighthouse was erected to replace an earlier structure, which was only high, emitted a light that was blending with other lights of the city, and was already in danger of falling into ruin. The date of construction of the earlier lighthouse is not known. However, there is evidence of studies during the tenure of as Governor of Portuguese Timor (1863‚Äì1864) for the construction of a lighthouse high. The studies depict a structure with a stone base, quadrangular mechanism, and an upper terrace with a cylindrical structure supporting the lamp. Construction of the present lighthouse began in 1889, during the governorship of Rafael J√°come Lopes de Andrade (1888‚Äì1890). In that year, the masonry base was completed. Maps published in 1892 and 1893 document both lighthouses simultaneously. The present lighthouse was completed in 1896, and has twice been reconstructed and improved: in 1932, and between 1948 and 1949 after the Japanese occupation of Portuguese Timor. The latter refurbishments included the landscaping of the lighthouse's platform. In 1949, a nearby house, which had been built before the Japanese occupation on the other side of what is now the , was adapted to become the residence of the lighthouse keeper. In the early 1950s, the adjacent area, informally named \\"Bairro do Farol\\", was developed in accordance with the 1951 General Urban Plan of D√≠li, as a residential area for high level colonial public servants and Europeans. Architecture and fittings Currently, the lighthouse consists of a octagonal metal skeletal tower rising from a massive masonry base, with a lantern and gallery at its peak. Access to the lantern is by an exposed stairway spiralling around a central column.

The property was built in 1886 for John Gill. It is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site was at the rear of the Assistant Colonial Surgeon, Dr William Redfern's residence and formed part of the Hospital Garden between 1795-1816. Harrington Street was formed in 1810 as part of Macquarie's' rationalisation of Sydney streets. During an archaeological excavation near the intersection of Harrington and Argyle Streets in 1989-90, architectural remains including terracotta roof tiles were noted associated with a building demolished by the early 1820s, and possibly constructed before the creation of Harrington Street. The Sydney Hospital was transferred to Macquarie Street in 1816, the Assistant Surgeon's residence being occupied by architect Francis Greenway until the 1830s. The exact nature of Greenway's occupation is contentious. When he was ordered to quit the property in 1822 he was in the process of building a new house, the plans of which had been approved by Macquarie two years before. Greenway claimed that the Governor had promised him the land, however as soon as Macquarie left the colony an eviction notice was served, and Macquarie couldn't substantiate Greenway's claim. Greenway was still living in the house in the 1830s and it is unclear what the outcome of the eviction was. Plans of 1834 show Greenway as the sole claimant of the George Street side of the block and contesting ownership of the Harrington Street frontage, the subject site. However, by 1823 the corner of Harrington and Argyle Streets was occupied by someone other than Greenway and another round of claims began that lasted until at least 1837. Contested ownership The possession of the site was hotly contested, the protagonists being James Rampling / William Hawkins and John Gleeson / Thomas Ryan. William Hawkins was said to have been granted the land by Macquarie on or before 1822. Rampling claimed to have paid Hawkins thirty pounds for the transfer of the allotment in 1822 and had built a two-storey house and fence on it. Rampling arrived in the colony as a convict under a 14-year sentence in 1814, his occupation described as a \\"plummer\\". By the 1820s he was describing himself as a baker and the house he built has a bakehouse attached, as well as the possible remains of a bakehouse next door at the rear of 28 Harrington Street. In 1824 Rampling was ordered by D'Arcy Wentworth, the Police Superintendent, to stop building and in May, Rampling indicated to the Surveyor General that Thomas Ryan was endeavouring to have him removed from the property. He was ordered to quit in August. In 1825 the Surveyor John Oxley claimed that \\"Hawkins never had any claim to the allotment in Harrington Street but that it was unauthorizedly taken possession of by a convict named Rampling\\". It was said Rampling had made application for the property but was refused because he was a prisoner of the Crown. Hawkins \\"a mere instrument in the hands of Rampling\\" applied for the lease although - as Oxley points out- he had no claim for it. The legacy of Rampling's brief occupancy was the (uncompensated) construction of a two-storey stone house / shop with bakehouse attached. In December 1825 Thomas Ryan, representing John Gleeson, brought a case against Rampling in the Supreme Court to have him removed from the property. The judge found in favour of Ryan. Writing 12 years later Rampling stated that \\"it was proved that Gleeson had a lease for twenty one years of the said allotment previous to the grant to Hawkins and I was subsequently ejected\\". The title for the property first records its lessee as John Gleeson, given a twenty one- year lease for 3 June 1823 over the property bounded by Argyle and Harrington Streets, Harrington Lane (Suez Canal) and Greenway's property to the east. This therefore included the site of 28-32 Harrington Street. Gleeson and Ryan were Tipperary men when they were transported as convicts, arriving in 1817. By the time of the case against Rampling, Gleeson had transferred the property to Ryan. Rampling wrote to the Colonial Secretary in 1827 questioning the leases \\"How or in what manner these leases has been obtained is very mysterious\\". In 1830 Ryan disposed of the Argyle / Harrington Street properties. The site of Reynolds' Cottages was subdivided and sold to William Reynolds, a convict blacksmith also arriving in 1817. The corner block, including the house was sold to Fredrick Unwin. Unwin leased the house on the site to Caleb Salter who received a licence to operate the 'King's Head' in 1830. He held the licence to operate the hotel in what appears to be the same building built by Rampling until at least 1837. By 1834 Salter had acquired the freehold of the property and plans indicate it had been extended to the east, attaining a ground plan similar to the current structure, later plans indicate the extension to be a single storey. Conversion as a hotel Continuing the tradition of contesting the ownership of the site, in 1841 it was awarded to Rosetta Terry, and it continued to be known as the 'King's Head'. In 1845 the Sydney Municipal Rate Books record the property being owned by Rosetta Terry and Matthew Brown as the tenant. The premises is recorded as a house, but a map of 1844 indicates the building was an inn called the \\"Kings Head Inn\\". The place is described as two storey with seven rooms, built from stone with a shingle roof. From 1845 until at least 1861 it was called the \\"Rose and Crown\\". The Rate Book of 1856 indicates that the single storey shops to 41 & 43 Argyle Street were built during this year. The shops were constructed of stone, brick and wooden walls with a timber shingled roof. The shop in the most easterly portion of the place pulled down and new ones erected by 1877. By 1865 in the Sands Directory the place is called the Argyle Hotel and in 1868 the name British Seamen's Hotel appears with Mary Wormleighten manageress. The proprietor William Reilly, owned the property until when he sold it to graziers John and William Gill. Ownership by the Gill family The new proprietors were responsible in 1886 for creating the existing building. Interestingly the floor plans of the old hotel and the new building closely correspond. The new building included two shops built to the east along the Argyle Street frontage, this formalised an earlier arrangement of two timber shops previously constructed on the property in this area, and let. In 1899 the name of the Hotel was changed from British Seamen's Hotel to Hughes's Family Hotel, and was also known as McCarthy's Hotel in the 1920s. Resumption by the NSW Government The property was released to the Crown in 1903.Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, 1978: HP/26. The former Hotel was used as a public house/hotel up until around 1925-7, and in 1928 the building was changed to a residential use, a boarding house. There appears to have been few changes to the building during this time. The former Hotel's use remained residential up to 1955 when it was converted into an office with staff amenities for Thomas Playfair Pty Ltd, a major meat export company at the time. In 1970, the control of the property passed to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. The property continued to be let for various uses until major conservation work was undertaken of the exterior and interior of the building in 1995. In 1995-96, the Sydney Cove Authority undertook the full conservation of the exterior and the interior of the former hotel. Based on physical evidence, wallpapers, paint schemes, tiles, joinery and door and window hardware were reproduced for the building to interpret it as a hotel operating during the 1890s. In 1996 the refurbishment of the building won the National Trust Energy Australia Heritage Week Awards for the Interior. It has had a range of tenants since then and currently houses a boutique bar.  Description  The north elevation faces Argyle Street and has been designed in the Federation Free Classical style. The elevations are highly decorative with rendered horizontal banding, stone detailing, arched windows with leadlight panels and parapet wall. The western elevation faces Harrington Street and is similar but narrower to the north elevation. The eastern elevation adjoins 45 Argyle Street (s) and the southern elevation adjoins 30 Harrington Street (s); both are in painted face brick. The building is divided into two distinct parts. One is a single storey retail outlet on the ground floor and the other, the former hotel, is on two levels. The hotel consisted of 13 rooms, two WCs, a basement which is accessed from the ground floor street corner room and serviced from Argyle Street and a private rear courtyard. The interiors of the former hotel are highly ornate.Tropman, 1992: 24-26Sydney Cove Authority, Annual Report, 1996: 26 Extensive conservation work was undertaken on the building in 1995-96, and its condition is excellent.  Heritage listing  The former British Seamens Hotel and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Its listing on both the non-statutory heritage register of the National Trust of Australia and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate demonstrate the esteem the building is held in by the wider community. Development on the site is representative of the historical phases from 1788 to the present day. Initially the site was located in the grounds of the Assistant Surgeon and Hospital gardens. Therefore, it has strong historical associations with the first hospital and especially the first Assistant Surgeon, Dr Redfern. It also has strong associations with other prominent people such as Francis Greenway, colonial architect (1816-1822) and later Rosetta Terry, wife of Samuel Terry. It is the site of one of the earlier inns in the Rocks - dating from the 1830s. This use remained without interruption until the late 1920s. The place demonstrates various phases of hotel, residential and commercial related activities that formed a major component of the historical, social, cultural and architectural development of the Rocks. It is representative of a type of building traditionally associated with a meeting place and abode for working men within the traditional mixed residential, commercial, industrial and maritime uses of The Rocks area. The site's association with hotel activity lasted almost 100 years. This began with the early development of the Colony and reflected the social pastime of the local community and transient maritime workers. It is reasonable to assume that the former hotel had a strong social link with British Seamen due to its former name the British Seamen's Hotel, which first appeared in 1868 and continued until 1899. The changing social patterns and lifestyles are reflected in the change of use for the building. The residential and commercial activities changed in The Rocks reflecting the area's changing association with the wharves. In the late 1920s the building was converted for residential use as a boarding house. In the mid 1950s it was converted to commercial use. The building allows social and cultural changes to be interpreted. It has historical significance in allowing the Rocks Resumption Act to be interpreted. It allows interpretation of earlier structures and architectural solutions to later alterations and additions. It is associated with the increased importance of Argyle Street with construction of the Argyle Cut. It is representative of early subdivision and development patterns and later consolidation patterns. Ownership of the site was contested by several people, illustrating the problems associated with the granting of land and leases and recording of such. The place located on the corner of Argyle and Harrington Streets can be viewed from a distance and forms an important link between the earlier 19th century buildings on the adjoining boundaries. The building before its 1880s alterations was of a similar nature to the adjoining buildings which are of a Colonial Georgian style, providing a contrast with the ornate form of the site. The alterations reflect the changing architectural styles that were favoured at the time. The form, scale and detailing on the place contributes to the historical streetscape. - The well designed, street facades on the former hotel and shops are very good examples of Federation Free Classical Style. It allows interpretation of the operations of an early hotel and shop. The site has been the subject of a limited archaeological investigation. This identified the rich archaeological resource still remaining on site. Therefore, the site has significant research potential as an archaeological resource which can inform about the former buildings and usage of the site as well as the changing lifestyles of its inhabitants.Tropman & Tropman Architects. 2007 British Seamen's Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.
