It was one of the shortest-lived stations in post-World War II Britain, being open for just over four years, between 1960 and 1964. History The branch line to Cirencester had opened on 31 May 1841, but no intermediate stations were provided east of the junction at Kemble until the introduction of Diesel railbuses on the line in February 1959, when the small station of was opened; less than a year later, on 4 January 1960, a second small station named Park Leaze Halt was opened. There was a single low platform, on the down side (north) of the line and on the Cirencester side of an overbridge; the platform was constructed from sleepers, and there was no shelter. The station was from Paddington. With the opening of this halt, the railcar service between Kemble and Cirencester increased from 13 to 14 in each direction on weekdays (three more ran on Saturdays). The halt served an area of farmland, the immediate population being approximately 20. The nearest village was Ewen, but the distance from Ewen to Kemble was not much more than to Park Leaze Halt, so the halt was only useful for Ewen residents if they were visiting Cirencester. The halt closed with the end of passenger services on the Cirencester Town branch on 6 April 1964, the last trains having run on the evening of 5 April.

Although this was known by the Spanish Government and many formal complaints were forwarded from USCA (main air traffic controllers Spanish union), the Spanish Government took action and declared rate 0 (no air movements) to avoid having controllers exceeding the work hours. On the following morning a royal decree to impose martial law over the civil air traffic controllers was declared, hence the mentioned maximum working hours would not apply. Operations in a total of eight airports, including the country's two main airports, Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat were supervised by military forces, however the control was still exercised by the same air traffic controllers. The move by controllers came after a year of dispute with the government and the Spanish airport authority Aena over working conditions, work schedules and benefits. According to some sources, air traffic controllers could earn up to 350,000 euros per annum, a claim that has been hotly disputed. This has meant that the controllers have not received much sympathy on this dispute in Spain. On the same day of imposing martial law, the Spanish Council of Ministers approved plans to partially privatise Aena. The use of emergency powers was the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1975 that a state of alert had been called and created a perfect cover up by the Spanish Government to change working conditions and benefits on air traffic controllers unilaterally. Under the measure, controllers were escorted by armed guards and faced arrest for the crime of disobedience, stipulated in the Spanish military penal code in case of not showing up at work. Some controllers reported to have been forced to work at gunpoint. The use of this measure by the Spanish government has been severely criticised by ATCEUC (Air Traffic Controllers European Unions Coordination) through a press release.

It operated through the Bloomington Public Schools in Bloomington, Minnesota, and was created in 1995 by Kevin Byrne within the South Hennepin Adult Programs in Education (SHAPE), a program started in 1978 for adult and alternative school within the Bloomington Public Schools. Mindquest operated until the end of 2003, when the Bloomington Schools closed it in favor of a regional distance learning program. Operations Mindquest allowed students to earn a high school diploma completely on the Internet by means of web-based interaction between and among students, teachers, and mentors. High school juniors and seniors were able to gain extra credits or undertake their entire high school diploma. Mindquest operated via Softarc‚Äôs FirstClass communications and bulletin board software. A key obstacle for Mindquest in its early days was visibility, as few people had access to the Internet in 1995. The original budget was $131,000 and served eighty students, both teenagers and adults. Minnesota students did not have to make tuition payments, however out-of-state students paid tuition. By 2001 there were about 300 online learners, attending 535 courses, with students enrolled from as far away as India. Mindquest was unique in that the curriculum was entirely created by Mindquest staff. Legacy Mindquest was managed on a day-to-day basis by Julie Williams, who later developed an online charter school called MN Online High School, was still in operation in 2011. The instructional leader of SHAPE and Mindquest, Greta Ploetz, received grant funding from the Bush Foundation to create the Mindquest Academy, an online college entrance preparation program that in 2011 was still in operation through the Minnesota Department of Education. Martin Borg, a Mindquest teacher, and Kevin Byrne created an online assessment company called Achievement Data, Inc (ADI) in 1998, and sold it to Questar in 2005.

History Lackawanna Limited Around 1900, the DL&W; launched a marketing campaign around the fictional character of Phoebe Snow to emphasize how the exhaust from its steam locomotives was cleaner than competitors' locomotives, as a result of using anthracite coal. The train took its name from the character. Its route traveled across New Jersey, passing over the Paulinskill Viaduct and the Delaware River Viaduct of the Lackawanna Cut-off; Pennsylvania, passing over the Tunkhannock Viaduct; and the Southern Tier region of New York. The Lackawanna Limited was known for its fast time as well as the scenery of the route. It included a Pullman full vestibule parlor car, sleeping car, dining car, and coaches. Running during daylight hours, scenery included the Delaware Water Gap, Pocono Mountains, and the Susquehanna and Genesee River valleys. The fast train stopped only at principal cities. On August 30, 1943, the Lackawanna Limited wrecked in Wayland, New York, when it sideswiped a local freight that had not cleared into a siding, killing 20 and injuring more than 100. DL&W; era (1949-60) Lackawanna Railroad Form 10 passenger schedules showing DL&W; diesel equipment and a motto: \\"The Route of Phoebe Snow\\" On November 15, 1949, the DL&W; inaugurated a new streamlined passenger train named after its long- dormant promotional symbol. Launched by DL&W; president William White, the new Phoebe Snow represented the DL&W;'s modernization of its passenger train fleet, and image, as it became Train No. 3 (westbound) and No. 6 (eastbound), which previously had been assigned the railroad's former premier train, the Lackawanna Limited. The Phoebe Snow ran on a daylight schedule between Hoboken, New Jersey (Hoboken Terminal), and Buffalo, New York (Lackawanna Station), making the trip in about eight hours. Westbound, after Elmira, the sleepers and some coaches would continue on to Chicago, Illinois, over the Nickel Plate Railroad's Nickel Plate Limited and, on return, would be transferred in Buffalo from Train No. 10, the New York Mail. The train's reclining seat coaches were taken from a pool of 26 cars split between builders Pullman-Standard and American Car & Foundry (ACF). The dining cars and tavern-lounge-observation cars for the two Phoebe Snow consists were built by the Budd Company, while the through sleeping car in each consist was taken from a pool of nine 10-roomette, 6-double bedroom cars built for the Lackawanna by ACF. Motive power was provided initially by an A-B-A set of passenger-equipped EMD F3 diesels, but their steam generators provided insufficient heat to the train in winter, and were supplanted by a pair of EMD E8A diesel-electric locomotives. In 1958, as part of the consolidation of operations between the Erie and DL&W; railroads--the roads would merge formally in 1960 to form the EL--DL&W;'s mainline between Binghamton and Corning, New York, was severed and all trains traveling between those points were rerouted over the Erie mainline. Between April 29 and July 1, 1962, all passenger trains between Corning and Buffalo were re-routed off the DL&W; mainline over Dansville Hill to the former Erie mainline via Hornell, New York, a route that was longer than the old one, and which added an hour to the scheduled time. EL era (1963-66) One of the last Phoebe Snows departing Chicago at 130th St. And Torrence Ave. on November 25, 1966 Erie Lackawanna Railroad Company Main Line Timetable showing such famous trains as Phoebe Snow, Lake Cities, and Erie Lackawanna Limited After the EL merger, the Phoebe Snow continued to run as #3. However, since the signature Tavern-Lounge cars (observation cars), with the Phoebe Snow drumheads on their tailends, were so closely identified with the train, when these cars were taken off the train and placed into storage shortly after the merger, many observers were led believe that the train had been discontinued. This was not true. The train continued to run, albeit without the cars that arguably defined it and with a new name - Erie-Lackawanna Limited (a merger renaming of the Erie Limited). Reportedly the cars had been placed into storage, in the unused Erie shop facilities at Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, because they were deemed a nuisance as they had to be turned on a turntable or a wye at the end of each trip. An alternative explanation for the discontinuation of the cars was that the Erie management resented the symbol of the DL&W; playing such a prominent a role in the EL passenger train operation and sought to dispose of it wherever they could. However, it was equally true that the observation cars' bar facilities lacked the ability to provide proper food service, unlike the EL's dining- lounge cars which could serve both meals and beverages as well as provide distinct seating for each type of service. Whatever the reason, the observation cars were restored after William White was appointed EL president on June 18, 1963. The originator of the Phoebe Snow ordered the train \\"reborn\\" as train #1, replacing the short-lived Erie-Lackawanna Limited. White was looking for a way to boost both EL employee morale and to gain some positive publicity for the foundering railroad; the move accomplished both. However, since a Hoboken-Chicago routing was chosen, which bypassed Buffalo, the train was put in direct competition with the New York Central Railroad's passenger operation. In an earlier time, the new train might have flourished, but with the steadily declining image of passenger rail travel in the U.S. in general, and competition from airlines in particular, it was doomed from the start. On November 27, 1966, the EL terminated the Phoebe Snow for good, leaving the Lake Cities as the EL's last long haul passenger train using Phoebe Snow diner cars and sleeper service, a service that ran until the Lake Cities also was discontinued on January 5‚Äì6, 1970. The trademark tavern Lounge cars were placed in storage again after the final run, although they appeared occasionally at the rear of special trains until sold off. Amtrak The EL discontinued its last long-distance passenger train, Lake Cities, on January 6, 1970, about 16 months before Amtrak took over most U.S. passenger train operations. Amtrak might have taken over the Hoboken-Chicago operation, but observers speculated that the EL wanted to rid itself of its passenger trains before that could happen. On November 13, 1979, three years after Conrail assumed operation of the former EL lines, Amtrak operated an inspection train over the former route of the Phoebe Snow between Hoboken and Scranton to determine the feasibility of restoring rail service between the two cities, and to try to prevent the abandonment of the Lackawanna Cut-Off. Dubbed the Pocono Day Express, it was the last passenger train to run over the route of Phoebe Snow in the twentieth century. Amtrak was facing budget cuts that threatened numerous routes across the country at that time, however. The addition of a new route, one which had not seen a passenger train in nearly a decade, was a low priority. Proposals for service restoration On January 25, 2008, New York Senator Charles Schumer announced that Amtrak and the New York Department of Transportation were studying a proposal to create a passenger rail line between Syracuse, New York; Binghamton; and Scranton, with service on to New York City via a restored Lackawanna Cut-Off. Unlike the original Phoebe Snow train, which terminated at the ferry terminal in Hoboken, the new service would reach New York's Pennsylvania Station via the Kearny Connection. Although Schumer's proposal reportedly has been shelved in favor of a routing via Albany, New York, New Jersey Transit is pursuing a proposal to offer commuter rail service between Scranton and New York. Disposition of cars The ACF coaches used on the Phoebe Snow were split up; most were sold to New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority for use as commuter cars. At least one coach ended up with Conrail where it was used on the Valpo Local out of Chicago, and several were sold to the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. As of 2012, surviving coaches include: *310/1310: Kept in the former Lehigh Valley Railroad yard in Sayre, Pennsylvania, it is owned by the Myles Group, operator of the Tioga Central Railroad.http://nrhs1.org/assets/1503_March_Dispatcher.pdf *311/1311: converted into an open-air car, it runs on the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad *315/1315 and 317/1317: Formerly part of the Coe Rail dinner trains, they are now owned by the Medina Railroad Museum in New York. *318/1318: Privately owned in Iowa, it is being restored as a lounge car in a hybrid DL&W;/EL paint livery. *325/1325: Restored as a Milwaukee Road coach, it currently runs on the Austin and Texas Central Railroad.http://www.austinsteamtrain.org/buckeye- lake Both Tavern-Lounge cars (789 and 790) survive.

Literally Onnu Kure √Åyiram Yogam means an association of one minus one thousand. The yogam (association) was an organisation of Nairs of the region and various sub classes of the Nair community had representations in the yogam. The members of the yogam were the administrators of the Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple. The yogam used to be held on the first day of every month before the Kodungallur Bhagavathy temple and considered all matters pertaining to the subjects who are within their jurisdiction and took appropriate decisions.  History  The yogam was once a militant force under the Cheraman Perumals (kings of Chera dynasty) composed of one thousand people including the Perumal (the Chera king). Even after the end of Chera dynasty in the early 12th century, the organization continued to exist; but they decided not to fill the absence of the Chera kings. Hence the number shrank to nine hundred and ninety nine and the yogam became known by its present name. Today, the organisation is usually referred to by its acronym, OKAY. Even after the end of the Perumal reign, when the Kodungallur Royal Family took over the administration in the region, the yogam and the kings used to meet and take joint decisions on the administration of the temple on the first day of every month (Kollam Era). They also performed a ritual called Nizhalirikkal, after Pantheeradi Puja, at the east gate of the temple in continuation of the summit . Nizhalirikkal was a committee on administration of the temple which had a quorum of 32 members. Pantheeradi (twelve feet) Puja (worship) is one of the daily puja rituals performed in Kerala temples when the shadow reaches 12 feet of length.  Present day operations  Today the yogam directly administers the functions of the temple on important dates. For example, it administers the functions on the first day of the Th√°lappoli festival which is a four-day festival being held in January each year. It also funds various community activities.

The style is focused on practical application in a real fight including multiple attackers. History The first worldwide public display of Sabaki was in the documentary on the first Kyokushin World Open Tournament in 1975. Shihan Hideyuki Ashihara (senior instructor) displayed his Sabaki skills to defeat multiple attackers in a demonstration at the start of documentary. In 1980, Hideyuki Ashihara established his own style of karate forming the New International Karate Organisation (NIKO) - Ashihara Karate Kaikan and became the Kancho (Grandmaster) of NIKO. The Honbu (headquarters) of Ashihara is located in Matsuyama City. Kancho Ashihara appointed senior student Joko Ninomiya and tournament champion, who was already based in the United States, as Shihan (senior instructor) for the United States. Technique The technical aspects of Ashihara are shaped around 6 basic areas: *Basics techniques. *Four movements. *Positioning. *Sabaki *Kata. *Kumite. The basics are 21 basic techniques which are all practical in a street fight. The katas are based on Sabaki and are applicable to real fighting situations making them unique in the world of karate. There are six kata types: *Beginners kata (Shoshin no kata). *Basic kata (Kihon no kata). *Throwing kata (Nage no kata). *Sparring kata (Kumite no kata). *Fighting kata (Jissen no kata). *Self- defense kata (Goshin no kata) In the katas there are three types of pattern: short, middle and long range. Each kata can be used for solo combination practice or with a partner as control technique training. Ashihara Karate is called a modern style, in part, for its revolutionary katas have no historical influence from traditional Samurai era karate katas, every move (strike, footwork, block or sweep) is effective in a street fight with the karateka envisioning an opponent and once the kata is mastered by the karateka it will then be performed with an attacker, with the karateka grading solo and with an attacker. Full contact fighting (kumite) is practiced in training and in gradings. Sabaki Sabaki is a difficult concept to translate from Japanese. Broadly speaking, Sabaki refers to movement, often involving a concept of control, sometimes implying preparation for a subsequent movement. For example, Sabaki can be used in reference to training a horse. The rider performs certain movements in an effort to control the animal, in order to make the animal behave as he/she wants it to. Kancho Hideyuki Ashihara has adopted the word Sabaki to epitomize the essence of this style of Karate. In Ashihara Karate, Sabaki describes the movement made by a defender stepping out of line of an attack, into a position from which he/she can launch a counter- attack. This controlled movement, in preparation for a subsequent advance, is the basis of the strategy of Ashihara Karate: the combination of defence and offense into one ... SABAKI. The essence of Ashihara Karate is contained within Sabaki, the method of fighting that combines defense and offense into one. In creating Sabaki, Kancho Ashihara considered the various functions of the human body, and how to maximise the body performance in order to control an opponent without being punched or kicked. For example, there are directions of movement that the human body finds easy as well as awkward. If your opponents approach head on, it needs a great deal of power to force them back, especially if they are a lot stronger. If instead, you step to his side and pull him onward, he will carry on under his own steam. At that point, if you apply a little force from the outside, you can change the direction of his momentum and upset his balance. By using your opponents force against them, you can see how someone who is not as strong can fell a much larger opponent. If this principle can be understood and mastered, then karate becomes something which anyone can learn. Two important concepts of Sabaki are fight control and positioning. Positioning - refers to the ability to take up a position at the opponents side or back (blindspot) from which you can easily attack without being attacked yourself. Fight control - is a term that represent that which Ashihara Karate stands for, it involve a revolutionary, scientific, logical and safe type of self-defense training; specifically, it refers to the ability to take up a safe and strong position from which to contain your opponent and launch a counter-attack. Instruction guide Kancho Ashihara published his first book in English in 1985 titled Fighting Karate. An instructional video was released in 1985 in English. A second instructional book titled More Fighting Karate was published in 1989. In Japanese, Kancho Ashihara published his first book in 1983 Jissen Ashihara Karate, his second book in 1984 Jissen Ashihara Karate 2 and his third book in 1987 Jissen Ashihara Karate 3. Kancho Ashihara released his first Japanese instructional video in 1984, his second in 1986 and third also in 1986. The Ashihara Karate International Organisation led by Kaicho Hoosain Narker has also produced several instructional manuals which includes: Student Handbook, Kata Guide, Operations Manual, Administration Manual, Teaching Manual, Preparing for Black Belt & Tournament Preparation Manual Kata Guide, Theory Test Handbook http://www.shugyosha.org/html/books.html They have also produced several instructional DVD which includes: Ashihara Karate Sabaki, Ashihara Karate Blue Belt part 1, Ashihara Karate Blue Belt part 2, Ashihara Karate Kata 1 http://www.shugyosha.org/html/dvd_s.html Uniforms and ranking The karate gi was unique at the time as it featured the name of the style on the back of the jacket in English \\"Ashihara Karate\\", in addition to the Ashihara in kanji on the front of the jacket, and also on the left sleeve there was an Ashihara logo in colour and in English. The ranking and belt system is the same as Kyokushin. The Karate Dogi is the outfit worn for karate training. It consists of a jacket (uwagi) and trousers (zubon) made of white cotton or canvas and a belt (obi), the colour of which indicates the rank of the student. The Ashihara school allows one to have badges (crests) on the left side of the chest and on the left sleeve. The belt worn indicates the rank of the karate ka according to the standard ranking system adopted in Ashihara Karate. The ten lower ranks (Mudansha) of Kyu or non-black belt holders are divided into the following colours: white, blue, yellow, green and brown. The upper ten ranks (Yudansha) of Dan have the holders wearing the black belt. Tournament Kancho Ashihara did not initially create an annual World Tournament for the style. United States Shihan Joko Ninomiya had been holding an annual tournament in Denver since 1978 in Kyokushin rules which continued after NIKO was formed now in Ashihara rules. This tournament named the Sabaki U.S. Open Karate Challenge became the de facto World Tournament open to all styles with Ashihara rules and attracted international entrants including Japanese. The tournament was held until 1988. The South African NIKO group held their first variant of the Sabaki Challenge Championships in 1987, followed by the second one in 1988. This was after two South Africans, Hoosain Narker & Brian Ebden competed in the last US Sabaki Challenge Championships organised by Joko Ninomiya shihan. Since then they held several others, but in 1990 started an Invitational International Championships supported by Kancho Ashihara with a foreword written by him in the first and second editions of the tournament. In 1996, this tournament merged with the Sabaki Challenge, by then the group had separated from NIKO and formed the AKI. In 2010, the AKI celebrated their dojo's 30th Anniversary by hosting its 30th Anniversary 1st World Championshipshttp://www.worldsabaki.org/ in Cape Town, South Africa. In October 2018, they will host their 2nd World Championships in Pune, India. In 1993, Kancho Ashihara gave permission to the Denmark Branch to organize a World Tournament naming it the Sabaki Challenge Spirit. In 1994, the first annual Sabaki Challenge Spirit was held in Denmark. The tournament was only open to NIKO karateka. No Japanese competitors ever entered preferring to compete in Kyokushin tournaments in Japan. In 2011, the tournament affiliation with NIKO ceased and ever since NIKO has organized their own tournament named the Sabaki World Championship. Ashihara tournaments are similar to Enshin karate tournaments such as rules - weight divisions, winning by knockout or points, scoring, allowed techniques, one handed grabs and throws. Students Kancho Ashihara students include former US head instructor Joko Ninomiya (Kyokushin 1978 All Japan Tournament champion and Kyokushin 1975 World Open finalist) founder of Enshin Karate, former Honbu senior instructor Makoto Hirohara (Sabaki US Open Karate Challenge Tournament Champion) founder of Shintaiikudo and former Honbu senior instructor Hiroshi Harada founder of Josui International Karate. Foreign students include David Cook, founder of Tsu Shin Gen & Hoosain Narker, founder of the Ashihara Karate International organisation Today Ashihara established branches in Japan and spread throughout the world. Kancho Ashihara died in 1995 at 50 years of age due to illness before his death he named his young son Hidenori to be his successor as Kancho of NIKO. Karate schools derived from NIKO, include Enshin in the United States, Shintaiikudo in Japan, Josui International Karate Organisation in Japan, Ashihara International Karate Organization (AIKO) in Holland, International Ashihara Karate Association (IAKA) in Russia, Ashihara Karate International (AKI) in South Africa, Ashihara BudoKai in Russia and TSG ‚Äì Ashihara International Karate in Sweden.

The game was also published by Sears for their Tele-Games product line as Speedway II.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot Street Racer was one of the two launch titles programmed by Kaplan; Air-Sea Battle was the other. Street Racer offered 27 game variations, grouped into the following sub-games: * 1‚Äì6: Street racer * 7‚Äì12: Slalom * 13‚Äì16: Dodgem * 17‚Äì20: Jet shooter * 21‚Äì24: Number cruncher * 25‚Äì27: Scoop ball Each of the sub-games has roughly the same gameplay: the player controls a vehicle that must avoid or collect certain objects as they scroll down the screen. Between one and four players can compete simultaneously by using the paddle controllers, which allow the vehicle to move left and right along the bottom of the screen. If a one-player game is selected, the player competes with a static computer opponent that allows objects to collide with it or pass by. Development As one of the earliest games written for the platform, Street Racer suffered from unattractive, blocky graphics. According to Kaplan himself, later racing games released for the Atari, such as Activision's 1982 games Barnstorming and Grand Prix, were able to offer improved graphics and gameplay. In a 2007 interview with Digital Press, Kaplan was asked what he would change about any of the games he had written: Kaplan went on to become one of the founders of Activision where he developed Kaboom!, one of the 10 top-selling games for the Atari 2600.  Reception  Street Racer was reviewed in Video magazine as part of a general review of the Atari VCS where it was given a review score of 5.5 out of 10. The game did not age well and modern critics have given it poor reviews as well. Gamasutra have described the \\"Number cruncher\\" sub-game as a highlight of the game.

The film starred both Tot√≤ and the comedy team of Franco and Ciccio. Plot The film is composed of five episodes. In the first a German nanny behaves too rude and harsh with children, proposing to read comic social satire of Germany. The children are upset. In the second Toto is an old bourgeois who joins with a nice young girl. The girl follows the social models of the time, namely the \\"hippies\\" guys. Toto, however, is a man of the old school, and hates these young people who are considered by him dirty, ignorant and rude. But Toto soon comes in contact with them, and so plans a diabolical revenge against the youngsters. In the third a couple remains stuck in traffic in Rome. The woman, uncaring, intimates with violence her husband to look for a way out of traffic. She manages to exasperate the man who, after a crash with a car, holds the wrench and injures the driver. The woman then, hypocrite, accuses him of violence. In the fourth Tot√≤ and Ninetto are puppets specially created to give life to the show \\"Othello\\" by Shakespeare. Ninetto plays the role of the protagonist, but he realizes that Othello is a very bad man, and still more bad is the parasite Iago, played by Tot√≤; and so he begins to wonder why life is so bad. Toto replies that this is a mystery, because the two of them out of the scene are good, while in the history of Shakespeare's characters, they're bad. In the next episode, the Queen of England goes to Africa as an ambassador, to bring a message of hope and brotherhood. However, the woman says a wrong speech, and so the African people, believing that she is doing a racist discourse, hunt alone she to the civilized world. In the last story a woman is haunted by her husband, because she thinks he is cheating on her. Eventually, after several quarrel, the man decides to betray really her, but in the end the emotional bond with his wife recovers. The role of Tot√≤ Tot√≤ in the film plays two episodes: The Monster of Sunday, directed by Steno and What are clouds?, directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. In the first Tot√≤ is a man of the world who hate the fashion of the sixties, especially that of young people today who have long hair down to his shoulders and they believe everything they see over and dated. One day, the young girlfriend of Toto brings home a group of long- haired musicians who are placed in the living room and destroy all the warm and peaceful atmosphere desired by Tot√≤, who goes on a rampage. He plans to capture one by one the young hippies in his city and shave so that they become the children model and up to date. To do this, Tot√≤ changes position all the time and even disguise, placing first in the role of a priest, then a prostitute and finally a bagpipe player at the Spanish Steps in Rome, where it is recognized by all as \\"maniac kidnapper hippies\\". Reported to the police station, Tot√≤ manages to escape only proposing the judge to shave the hair also to his son who is hateful and staring just like all the other guys in the city who follow this fashion. In the second episode, the scene is set in a theater with no windows and exits where the puppets come to life to be infinitely the shows before the public. Domenico Modugno plays a scavenger singer who picks up the bodies of the puppets that occasionally break to throw them in the trash. This time the puppets interpret the tragedy Othello by William Shakespeare: Ninetto Davoli plays the protagonist brown, while Tot√≤ is the cruel and treacherous Iago. To complete the picture, there are also Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia in the role of captain and a guard. As the show continues, Ninetto begins to feel very sad because he is forced to play a thousand times the same roles and would like to find out what was outside the theater. In particular, he seeks the meaning of truth and Tot√≤ replied that the Truth is that which animates and makes interacting with other individuals. However, you should never say his name because otherwise it disappears. The scene continues with Othello discovers that the bride with handkerchief of another, bequeathed in his pocket cleverly by Iago, then the Moor of Venice strangles Desdemona acquiring the wrath of the public that breaks is the puppet that Ninetto Tot√≤. The two bodies are dragged away by the garbage collector, under the gaze sad and moved by the puppets and thrown in the trash. The dump Tot√≤ and Ninetto have the chance to see the beauty that lies outside the theater: the clouds. Tot√≤ will say, \\"Oh, the heartbreaking, wonderful beauty of Creation!\\".

He died on 4 June 1941. Early life Janeƒçek was born on 23 January 1878 in Kl√°≈°ter nad Dƒõdinou, a small village in Bohemia in the present-day Czech Republic. He went to Prague to study mechanics at the Prague Technical School and then moved to Germany to the Berlin College of Engineering. Upon graduation he returned to Prague and began working for the Jewish industrialist Emil Kolben at the Kolben company. He did well and when he was only 23 he was appointed manager of the new factory opened by Kolben in the Netherlands, where he met his future wife. He was hit by a car when riding his bicycle to work. The daughter of the driver gave him first aid, and they became friends and later married. At the age of 31 years, motivated by his success at designing inventions, Janeƒçek decided to quit Kolben and start his own engineering workshop in Prague. The pneumograf During the ten years after he moved to Prague, Janeƒçek's mechanical research workshop performed hundreds of experiments and registered dozens of patents. The most successful ones were related to sound recordings. He also spent some time travelling around Europe (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and England, among other places), looking for all kinds of technological innovations and new ways to organize work. Still, his greatest commercial prospects were placed on an invention known as the pneumograf (pneumograph). It consisted in a pneumatic system with a series of air tubes which activated a mesh of tiles, that each one had a black face and a white face. When air flowed through an individual tube, the tile attached to it would flip, revealing its white face and allowing to show an image on the background of black tiles. This way, the pneumograf could display several advertisements and daily reports. A prototype was presented in the top of a building in the N√°rodn√≠ avenue in Prague, located at the Jungmannovo n√°mƒõst√≠ 761/1 address, drawing the public's attention. Janeƒçek's plans included the installation of other pneumografs in Berlin, Warsaw and St. Petersburg. However, the arrival of the First World War put negotiations to a halt, and his project was never developed. World War I After serving on the Italian front in World War I Janeƒçek experienced a prolific period of designing and inventing and secured over sixty new patents, including a design for an improved hand grenade The grenade, named Model 21, became the standard hand grenade of the Czechoslovak army, and was nicknamed the \\"Janeƒçek\\". Motorcycle development Early Jawa 350 motorcycle Janeƒçek saw an opportunity in 1927 to turn a former armament factory into a motorcycle manufacturing company. He drew on his knowledge of engineering and his experience with factory mass production techniques and based his new motorcycle designs around an existing 498cc engine made by a German company called Wanderer. The new company was named JAWA in 1929, a compound of the first two letters of Janeƒçek and Wanderer. Janeƒçek first began producing Wanderer motorcycles under license in 1927 in order to diversify the interests of his arms factory. His first motorcycle has a number of advanced features, including shift-drive and a steel frame. He was able to recruit an experienced British motorcycle designer George William Patchett, and together they developed a range of competition motorcycles to promote the new Jawa brand. In the 1930s Janeƒçek expanded the range to include lightweight economy models based around British Villiers two-stroke engines, as well as middleweight 350cc side valve and overhead valve motorcycles under the Jawa brand (e.g. Jawa 350). World War II When Czechoslovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1938 Janeƒçek was forced to turn his factory over to the occupying command and it was used to produce German aircraft engines and generators. He continued to work in secret on the development of single cylinder two stroke motorcycles and the production was restarted following the end of the war. Franti≈°ek Janeƒçek died on 4 June 1941 and the Jawa company was then taken over by his son Karel Janeƒçek. Littlejohn adaptor The Littlejohn adaptor was a device that could be fitted on to the British QF 2 pounder (40 mm) anti-tank gun. It was used to extend the service life of the 2-pounder during World War II by converting it to squeeze bore operation. \\"Littlejohn\\" came from the literal anglicization of Franti≈°ek Janeƒçek's name.

It lies within Fitzrovia, in the W1 post code area. Cleveland Street also runs along part of the border between Bloomsbury (ward) which is located in London Borough of Camden, and West End (ward) and Marylebone High Street (ward) in the City of Westminster. In the 17th century, the way was known as the Green Lane, when the area was still rural, or Wrastling Lane, after a nearby amphitheatre for boxing and wrestling.

This border is ancient, largely following the old divide between the western parish of Saint Marylebone and the parish of Saint Pancras to the east and can be traced back as far as 1792. The street was also a boundary between large estates, such as the Bedford Estate and the Berners Estate.Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden (1970), pp. 34-37 Maps show that the southern end of modern Cleveland Street, beyond Riding House Street, was known as Upper Newman Street and then Norfolk Street. The northern section was once known as Upper Cleveland Street and Buckingham Place.Horwood Map (1792-1799), Peter Potter Map (1832), George Lucas Map of Maylebone (1846), Map of the Parish of St. Marylebone (1832) at Westminster City Archives It became Cleveland Street for its full length after a renumbering was ordered by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1867. The name comes from the Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland whose estate was connected in the 19th century with the Southampton (Wriothesley) property Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road & neighbourhood (1949), pp. 1-6 via Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton. The Southampton property later became the Bedford Estate. Cleveland Street is renowned for several historical events and buildings, the most notable recent one being the BT Tower.  History  The Cleveland Street Scandal happened in 1889 at 19 Cleveland Street (now demolished) which at the time housed a male brothel in which teenage telegraph boys served as prostitutes.Theo Aronson, Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld (1994) pp. 8‚Äì10 and Montgomery Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal (1976), pp. 20‚Äì23 The scandal was rumoured to involve Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, an heir to the throne of Great Britain, though this allegation has never been substantiated.Lees Milne, Harold Nicolson (1980-81), pp.231 A show inspired by the Cleveland Street scandal and titled Cleveland Street The Musical - with book and lyrics by Glenn Chandler - ran in London between April and May 2011. In his book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, Stephen Knight mentions Cleveland Street in conjunction with two houses in the street. According to Knight's theory, the royal family was connected with the Jack The Ripper murders from 1888, via the same Prince Albert Victor who he claims met his later wife, Catholic prostitute Annie Elizabeth Crook, at the studio of the painter Walter Sickert at 15 Cleveland Street. After their secret wedding, Annie Elizabeth Crook was allegedly settled in a flat at 6 Cleveland Street.Stephhen Knight, Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution (1976), pp. 22‚Äì28 The conspiracy theory behind the murders described in Knight's book has been loosely adapted into From Hell (1999), a graphic novel by Alan Moore from which a movie with the same title was adapted in 2001. Several scenes in the movie take place in Cleveland Street, although they were not shot on location.Internet Movie Database, From Hell Locations  Notable buildings  The Grade II listed buildings are numbers:National Heritage List - List Entry numbers 1356766, 1356767, 1356769, 1356771, 1219525, 1066258, 1291411, 1066259, 1219538 and 1242917 * 16-22 (terraced houses with attached shop, the first with later shop; c.1780-1800).

The tower was London tallest building when it was completed in 1960 and it remains a major London landmark, being currently the 8th tallest building in London at 177 metres plus a 12-metre antenna. *The frontage building of the former Cleveland Street workhouse later Middlesex Hospital annexe and outpatient department on the eastern side of the street at 44 c.1776. Over the years from 1778 until 2005 the building operated as a workhouse then a workhouse infirmary and more recently as a hospital. UCLH NHS Foundation Trust in 2010 proposed the building's demolition in a planning application (and conservation area consent) submitted to Camden London Borough Council to replace it with a large building mixing private accommodation with commercial space.Camden Council, Details Page for Planning Application - 2010/2205/P Camden Council, Details Page for Planning Application - 2010/2209/C However adjoining Westminster City Council objected on three grounds on 2 December 2010.Westminster City Council, Decision document 1\\\\. The City Council considers that the existing building is a heritage asset which makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would not preserve or enhance this character and appearance. The City Council considers that retention and refurbishment of all or a substantial part of the existing building should be pursued. 2\\\\. The proposals provide insufficient on-street car parking facilities for the development, particularly for the private housing market which would generate significant car parking demand. This would increase the pressure for car parking on surrounding streets to the detriment of highway safety and convenience. 3\\\\. The submitted Daylight, Sunlight and Shadow study shows that the proposed development would result in unacceptable losses of daylight for some of the residential properties on Cleveland Street which face the application site. This would be materially harmful to the local residential environment and lead to an unacceptable reduction in the quality of residential amenity. Retrieved 2011-07-26 The Cleveland Street Workhouse is of particular importance in light of the fact that Charles Dickens is known to have lived nearby in what is now 22 Cleveland Street. Dickens lived there as a young child between 1815‚Äì1816 and then again as a teenager between 1828-1831. His residence in the street has led to the suggestion that the nearby workhouse was probably the inspiration for Oliver Twist.Lorna Bradbury (20 January 2011) \\"Oliver Twist's Workhouse Discovered\\", The Telegraph Cleveland Street hosted the Middlesex Hospital, closed in 2005 and since demolished. The hospital occupied an entire block on the western side of the southern section of the street. The future of this site is currently uncertain, despite its sale by nationalised Icelandic Kaupthing Bank to Aviva Investors and Exemplar Properties.Deirdre Hipwell (18 July 2010), \\"Aviva wins Noho Square scheme\\", Independent on Sunday Cleveland Street was described as an area of special architectural and historic interest when it was designated a Conservation Area on 20 November 1990. Anomalously on its Camden side Cleveland Street is part of two conservation areas: the Fitzroy Square conservation area, and the Charlotte Street conservation area. This double designation is rare and possibly unique.

P. hermaphrodita is a bacterial-feeding nematode and is a lethal parasite of several terrestrial gastropod families such as Arionidae, Milacidae and Limacidae.Wilson, M. J., Glen, D. M., & George, S. K. (1993). The rhabditid nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita as a potential biological control agent for slugs. Biocontrol Science and Technology, 3(4), 503-511. It is also able to reproduce on rotting matter or penetrate and remain in resistant slug and snail species where it awaits for their death and will then reproduce on the cadaver (necromeny). P. hermaphrodita was first isolated and documented by A. Schneider in 1859 and was intensively studied in the 1990s by researchers at Long Ashton Research centre who were focussed on finding a new biocontrol agent for slugs. P. hermaphrodita was isolated here and developed as a biological control agent (Nemaslug¬Æ) Rae, R., Verdun, C., Grewal, P. S., Robertson, J. F., & Wilson, M. J. (2007).

Anatomy  10x magnification photo of Adult hermaphroditic female Parasitic nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita). 1 Eye Piece Unit = 9.5Œºm P. hermaphrodita is unsegmented, vermiform, bilateral symmetrical pseudocoelomate. The body dimensions and structure of P. hermaphrodita is comparable to C. elegans' with a body length 1.3 - 1.7 mm long and an estimated circumference of 0.180mm. The primary structures are the Rhabditida-specific mouth, the pharynx, the intestine, the reproductive system (uterus, spermatheca, gonads) and the cuticle. Like all nematodes, it has four muscle bands that span the length of the body and has no devoted respiratory or circulatory system.Lee, D. L. (Ed.). (2002). The biology of nematodes. CRC Press. 191-191; 294-295 P. hermaphrodita has four larval stages before becoming a fully reproductive hermaphroditic adult female.Wilson, M. J., Glen, D. M., George, S. K., & Butler, R. C. (1993). Mass cultivation and storage of the rhabditid nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, a biocontrol agent for slugs. Biocontrol Science and Technology, 3(4), 513-521. Males do exist in this species, but are very rare with Maupas only able to find 21 males among 15,000 individuals (0.14% of the population).Maupas, E, (1900) Modes et formes de reproduction des n√©matodes. Archives de Zoologie Exp√©rimentale et G√©n√©rale 7, 563-628. Third-stage dauer larvae are produced in unfavourable conditions such as low food levels, high population density or high temperatures.Riddle, D. L., & Albert, P. S. (1997). 26 Genetic and Environmental Regulation of Dauer Larva Development. Cold Spring Harbor Monograph Archive, 33, 739-768. Dauer larvae have constricted pharynx, double the thickness of a normal cuticle and increase of lipid droplets in their cytoplasm.Ludewig, A. H., Kober-Eisermann, C., Weitzel, C., Bethke, A., Neubert, K., Gerisch, B., ... & Antebi, A. (2004). A novel nuclear receptor/coregulator complex controls C. elegans lipid metabolism, larval development, and aging. Genes & development, 18(17), 2120-2133. However, the most important aspect of the dauer stage is its ability to serve as the infective stage that seeks out new hosts, once the previous bacterial food source has been depleted.Tan, L., & Grewal, P. S. (2001a). Infection behavior of the rhabditid nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita to the grey garden slug Deroceras reticulatum. Journal of Parasitology, 87(6), 1349-1354.Tan, L., & Grewal, P. S. (2001b). Pathogenicity of Moraxella osloensis, a bacterium associated with the nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, to the slug Deroceras reticulatum. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 67(11), 5010-5016. Dauers do not require a food source and can survive up to eight times longer than the original life span of a non-dauer nematode. P. hermaphrodita is morphologically identical to two other Phasmarhabditis species P. neopapillosa and P. tawÔ¨Åki. However, P. neopapillosa is a gonochoristic species with an equal number of males and females.  Biological control of slugs  Terrestrial gastropods are a common problem in agricultural areas with a moist climate around the world,Wilson, M., & Rae, R. (2015). Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita as a Control Agent for Slugs. In Nematode Pathogenesis of Insects and Other Pests. 509-521. Springer International Publishing. crop damage occurs via the eating of leaves and stems and/or contaminating them with slime and faeces.Williams, A. J., & Rae, R. (2015). Susceptibility of the Giant African Snail (Achatina fulica) exposed to the gastropod parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita. Journal of invertebrate pathology, 127, 122-126. In the UK alone, slugs affect 59% of total area for rapeseed oil crops and 22% of wheat crops.Nicholls, C. (2014) Implications of not controlling slugs in oilseed rape and wheat in the UK. Research Review No. 79. [PDF] Kenilworth: Agricultural & Horticulture Development Board. 4-5. Without any type slug control for both Rapeseed oil and wheat crops, the cost to the UK agricultural industry would be an approximate ¬£43.5 million per year. Slug pest Deroceras reticulatum is a common agricultural and horticultural pest and is one of the host species affected by Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita P. hermaphrodita was developed into a natural molluscicide to prevent crop damage from horticultural slug pests from the families Arionidae, Milacidae, Agriolimacidae, Limacidae and Vaginulidae.Grewal, S. K., Grewal, P. S., & Hammond, R. B. (2003). Susceptibility of North American native and non-native slugs (Mollusca: Gastropoda) to Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita (Nematoda: Rhabditidae). Biocontrol Science and Technology, 13(1), 119-125. P. hermaphrodita is the only nematode of the eight families associated with molluscs, which has been developed as a biological molluscicide, first released under the name Nemaslug¬Æ by MicroBio Ltd in 1994, then acquired by Becker Underwood in 2000 and finally taken over by BASF in 2012.Pieterse, A., Malan, A. P., & Ross, J. L. (2016). Nematodes that associate with terrestrial molluscs as definitive hosts, including Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita (Rhabditida: Rhabditidae) and its development as a biological molluscicide. Journal of Helminthology, 1-11. Nemaslug¬Æ is sold in 15 European countries and is widely used by farmers and gardeners. It can only kill slugs and snails and does not harm non-target organisms like earthworms, insects & acarids. Other methods of slug control include chemical molluscicides such as metaldehyde, iron phosphate and carbamate compounds (Methiocarb and Thiodicarb) have been shown to cause damage to many beneficial/non-beneficial non-target organisms including mammals.Iglesias, J., Castillejo, J., & Castro, R. (2003).

Pest management science, 59(11), 1217-1224. P. hermaphrodita is currently mass produced in fermenters (up to 20,000 litres) in a monoxenic liquid broth of the bacterium Moraxella osloensis. In the fields, P. hermaphrodita is applied at 3 x 10 nematodes per ha. Nemaslug¬Æ has been found to be successful at reducing agricultural damage from slug in crops such as Winter wheat,Wilson, M. J., Glen, D. M., George, S. K., Pearce, J. D., & Wiltshire, C. W. (1994). Biological control of slugs in winter wheat using the rhabditid nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita.

Annals of applied biology, 128(1), 117-126. strawberries, Brussels sprouts, asparagus and others. Even though Nemaslug¬Æ takes longer (1‚Äì3 weeks) to kill slugs than chemical molluscicides, it has been shown to be equally or more effective at killing slugs.Lacey, L. A., & Kaya, H. K. (2007). Field manual of techniques in invertebrate pathology. Dordrecht etc.: Kluwer acad. publ. Cop. 2000. 789‚Äì790. An added advantage to P. hermaphrodita is its ability to strongly suppress feeding of infected slugs and to deter non- infected slugs away from treated soil.Wilson, M. J., Hughes, L. A., Jefferies, D., & Glen, D. M. (1999). Slugs (Deroceras reticulatum and Arion ater agg.) avoid soil treated with the rhabditid nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita. Biological Control, 16(2), 170-176.  Reproduction and Development  Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is protandrous autogamous hermaphrodite, whose main substrate to reproduce on is mainly bacterial rich environments such as decomposing cadavers (slugs, snails, worms, insects), leaves, compost and slug faeces. Third stage infective dauers seek out new hosts responding to host cues such as slime and faeces Hapca, S., Crawford, J., Rae, R., Wilson, M., & Young, I. (2007). Movement of the parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita in the presence of mucus from the host slug Deroceras reticulatum. Biological Control, 41(2), 223-229. or a bacteria rich environment. Once a new host is found, the dauer enters the slug via the dorsal integumental pouch beneath the mantle and then to the shell cavity via the short canal, next the dauer then develops into a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite and starts to produce young. The mother can produce up to 250‚Äì300 young whilst inside their still alive host. Deroceras reticulatum infected with slug parasitic roundworm Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita. At this stage, depending on temperature, the weight of the gastropod, nematode density in the soil the host may die within 4 to 21 days, however, studies show if large enough (over 1g), some slugs (e.g. Arion lusitanicus) can resist infection. The process involved in killing the host is still not fully understood, whether it is due to internal damage from new offspring or the releasing of M. osloensis. M. osloensis was found growing cultures of P. hermaphrodita and was shown to kill slugs when injected in large amounts into D. reticulatum, but it is not vertically transmitted to offspring, hence its role in the pathogenicity process is currently unclear.Rae, R. G., Tourna, M., & Wilson, M. J. (2010). The slug parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita associates with complex and variable bacterial assemblages that do not affect its virulence. Journal of invertebrate pathology, 104(3), 222-226. When infected by P. hermaphrodita both morphological and behavioural characteristics of the slug change. Morphological changes include a swelling of the mantle area, where both fluid and reproducing nematodes accumulate. Infected slugs will also find secluded places to die, such as cracks in the soil where they can move down into and conceal themselves deeper within the soil layer.Pechova, H., & Foltan, P. (2008). The parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita defends its slug host from being predated or scavenged by manipulating host spatial behaviour. Behavioural processes, 78(3), 416-420. This is theorised to be P. hermaphrodita manipulating the host to go to a more favourable environment. This ensures that they are left alone with the cadaver and avoid any interference with scavengers.Foltan, P., & Puza, V. (2009). To complete their life cycle, pathogenic nematode‚Äìbacteria complexes deter scavengers from feeding on their host cadaver. Behavioural processes, 80(1), 76-79. The soil also helps to prevent the cadaver from drying out, which creates a moist environment that promotes diverse bacterial growth.Rae, R. G., Tourna, M., & Wilson, M. J. (2010). The slug parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita associates with complex and variable bacterial assemblages that do not affect its virulence. Journal of invertebrate pathology, 104(3), 225-226. Reproduction occurs and the next generation continues to reproduce until food runs out and more third stage infective dauers are produced and the cycle is repeated.

History 1890‚Äì1919 The Edmonton and District Railway Company received a charter in 1898 to build westward from Edmonton, Alberta to Pelly River, Yukon. Changing the company name to the Edmonton, Yukon and Pacific Railway Company (EY&PR;) in 1899, their charter eventually lapsed.https://www.ryerson.ca/~amackenz/history/national/y.html That year, the White Pass and Yukon line opened between Skagway, Alaska and Bennett, British Columbia (near the border). A year later, the line was extended to Whitehorse, Yukon. The British Columbia & Alaska Railway Company received a charter in 1910, but even its shrunken plansFort George Herald, 24 Feb 1912 never eventuated. Sir Richard McBride, the BC Premier (1903‚Äì15), encouraged nonviable railway development within the province, both emptying the provincial treasury,Prince George Citizen, 20 Apr 1978 and ultimately undermining all railway projects and burdening stakeholders. In liaison with the Alaska authorities and the respective federal governments, he envisaged the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) (whose reaching Prince George was far from imminent), being further extended to the Alaskan border at a cost of $40‚Äì60 million. He however recognized the proposal's potential military value for the United States.Fort George Herald, 5 Jul 1913Fort George Tribune: 2 & 9 Aug 1913 President Wilson's signing of the Alaska Railroad Bill of 1914 would expand the Alaska rail network within that territory, which in turn increased optimism regarding the possibility of a line from Alaska through Dawson City to the Peace River Country.Fort George Tribune, 28 Mar 1914 1920‚Äì1939 A 1922 proposal by American capitalists to acquire the PGE as part of a Seattle- Alaska line lacked credibility.Prince George Leader, 4 Aug 1922 Between 1925 and 1946, the BC government had a standing offer of 16 million acres of land to anyone willing to buy its PGE railway.Prince George Citizen, 20 Apr 1978 The Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway reached westward from Alberta to Dawson Creek, BC in 1930. In the following years, rumours circulated regarding an extension from this railhead through the Yukon to the Alaskan territory.Prince George Citizen, 16 Feb 1928 Interest waning, the 1930s were more focussed upon a highway to Alaska.Prince George Citizen: 7 Mar 1935, 26 Aug 1937, 2 & 30 Sep 1937, 7 Oct 1937, 8 Dec 1938, 29 Jun 1939 & 3 Aug 1939 1940‚Äì1949 During World War II, the head of the United States Western Defence Command and Fourth Army announced there was no pressing need for a railway to Alaska.Prince George Citizen, 26 Nov 1942 The United States Army Corps of Engineers surveyed a rail route during 1942-43. When Japan ceased to be a threat, the idea was temporarily abandoned, until tensions arose with the Soviet Union. If the sea-routes to Alaska were threatened, it was considered the Alaska Highway had the capacity to supply only one division of troops stationed in the north. In 1948, a resolution was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Relations committee to approve negotiations between Canada and the United States for the construction of a rail line.Prince George Citizen, 29 Jul 1948 The Port of Seattle and its feeder railroads were opposed to the project because it would reduce its sea-freight traffic with Alaska.Prince George Citizen, 26 Aug 1948 Nevertheless, Senator Warren Magnuson, from Washington state, was a strong proponent of the scheme.Prince George Citizen, 24 Mar 1949 He envisaged a link connecting the Fairbanks-Seward line with the Alaska-Yukon boundary. The PGE would build and operate the line northwest to this point, the project being financed by the American Congress in the form of prepaid trackage rights.Prince George Citizen, 27 Apr 1950 The Senate approved negotiations with Canada, but the House of Representatives resolution failed. The Senate Foreign Relations committee requested the president's co-operation with the Canadian Government on surveys and studies.Prince George Citizen, 4 Aug 1949 In due course, President Truman signed the railroad bill, which authorised him to negotiate an agreement with Canada for the $112-million Prince George-Fairbanks link.Prince George Citizen: 1 Sep 1949 & 27 Oct 1949 Opinion remained divided over the military merits of the scheme.Prince George Citizen, 24 Nov 1949 1950‚Äì1969 Consultants and contractors seeking a business interest in the venture realized that unless the project was well advanced by the end of the Korean War (1950‚Äì53), the proposal would likely evaporate. Consequently, they emphasized its urgency, in light of the immediate Soviet threat.Prince George Citizen, 6 Sep 1951 The provincial government and the respective central BC communities were very supportive and looked forward to Prince George, with its promised new rail connections, becoming the nodal point.Prince George Citizen: 23 Feb 1950 & 27 Aug 1951 The PGE provided Prince George with a direct southerly connection in 1952, and extended north to Fort St. John and Dawson Creek by 1958. The two transcontinental railways in Canada had refused to build the latter link without a legal guarantee of sufficient freight revenue to make the line profitable. This was equally true for the Alaska proposal.Prince George Citizen, 4 Dec 1952 Entrepreneur, Axel Wenner-Gren, promised partial financial backing for the venture, titled the Pacific Northern Railway (PNR). A report prepared by the Battelle Memorial Institute estimated that the line would require an annual subsidy of $34 million by 1980.Prince George Citizen, 16 Nov 1960 Construction costs would be $114 million. The Alaska International Rail and Highway Commission pressed for the U.S. Congress to endorse the concept, while relying upon Axel Wenner-Gren for the financing,Prince George Citizen, 3 Apr 1961 but no significant progress occurred prior to his death. 1970‚Äì1999 In 1972, the PGE was renamed the British Columbia Railway (BCR). The following year, the first 125 miles of the Dease Lake branch line opened at a capital cost of $75 million, followed by an operating loss of $25 million on the route over a six-year period. Since even optimistic traffic increases would not attain break-even point,Prince George Citizen, 30 Nov 1977 the line was abandoned for seven years. An agreement with logging company users recouped the further $25 million spent to replace rotted ties and washed out ballast needed for the rehabilitation. Mixed trains ran twice weekly.Prince George Citizen: 9 Jul 1988 & 19 Dec 1990 Calls were made to extend the branch more than 1,000 miles north through the Yukon and into Alaska to join the federally-owned Alaska state railroad.Prince George Citizen: 3 & 22 Jun 1977; & 30 May 1978 An Alaska state study outlined numerous economic benefits from developing mineral resources and suggested it could become a trunk line to Alaska ports.Prince George Citizen: 7 & 8 Feb 1977 Although preliminary studies showed the project financially feasible and environmentally sound, the BC government displayed no appetite for further financial commitments.Prince George Citizen: 27 Mar 1979 & 4 Apr 1979 It regarded financing as primarily the responsibility of the U.S. federal and Alaskan governments, with some contribution by the Canadian government.Prince George Citizen: 31 May 1978 & 1 Jun 1978 The prohibitive $2-billion cost put an indefinite damper on building the link.Prince George Citizen: 6 May 1982 & 18 Apr 1979 2000‚Äìpresent A 2006 study indicated a capital cost at $10.5 billion and suggested it be a joint public-private project.https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-alaska-railway- dc/economic-study-touts-alaska-canada-rail-link-idUSN2138860820070621 A 2015 study by the Van Horne Institute, which was commissioned by AECOM, examined a Fort McMurray, Alberta to the Port of Valdez, Alaska line for carrying bitumen, petroleum and other products. Covering 1,525 miles (2,440 kilometres), the estimated capital cost was $28‚Äì34 billion depending upon the volume of product shipped. In June 2019, the Alaska Railroad Corp. board of directors gave agreement to link Alaska and Canada by rail. Construction is estimated to cost $13 billion USD and is still pending permitting, land acquisition, and other planning. Per the agreement, the Alaska-Alberta Railway Development Corp. (a.k.a. \\"A2A Rail\\") will receive an ‚Äúexclusive right‚Äù to operate an Alaska-Canada railroad between Alaska and Fort McMurray, Alberta. Business reasons for developing this railroad were cited as access to Alberta oil sands as well as providing an alternative to overloaded mainland U.S. ports for inbound intermodal shipping from Asia.

The residence has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. History Dr. George Middleton was one of three sons, who all became doctors, of Dr. William Middleton who was a founding member of the School of Medicine at the University of Iowa. with He was a general practice doctor in Davenport who also worked as a physician for local industry, including the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. Middleton had this house built in 1903 and lived here until 1918 when he and his wife, who had no children, sold the house when he went into the Army Medical Corps during World War I. The house was built on Dr. William Middleton's estate and George did not receive title to the house until 1915. One of his brothers built the house across the alley. Their parent's home, which is no longer extant, was behind the brother's homes. In 1940 the Dr. George Middleton House became a duplex. It was returned to a single-family home by the early 1980s. Architecture Prominent Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen designed this house in the Neoclassical style. It features a hipped roof and two dormers that have their own hipped roof and gabled rooflines. The dormer unit projects slightly forward and is held in place with brackets. Below the dormers are two round- arch windows that are also bracketed and have an eccentric border. A large porch features four columns of the Doric order and clapboard covered piers. A two-story polygonal bay below a bracketed gable is located on the back of the south side of the house. The second front door from when the house was converted into a duplex remains as does a second-floor sun porch on the rear of the house.

The Food Doctor positioned itself in the field of healthier eating with a range of both of fresh and dried food products, online consultancy as well as personal consultations. Marber's life was metamorphosed after receiving a correct diagnosis in 1993; prior to this he spent most of his early years struggling with undiagnosed coeliac disease which was wrongly diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. This experience inspired him to change his career and study as a nutritional therapist. Marber trained at the Institute for Optimum Nutrition (I.O.N), based in Richmond, South West London; the institute was established in 1984 by fellow nutritionist Patrick Holford and Dr Linus Pauling. Marber received his Nutritional Therapy Diploma in 1999 and has since been made a Fellow at the Institute and remains one or their most high profile graduates. In 2009 at the 25th anniversary celebration of the I.O.N he was awarded the Best Media Advocate for his extensive publications and media presence. Ian Marber is a well-known member of Coeliac UK and has promoted public awareness of the disease. Marber's nutrition consultancy was based on one-to-one consultations, health and cookbooks. He believes in a simple, sensible and achievable roadmap for personal health and wellbeing. According to Marber \\"We believe that the correct nutrition is the cornerstone to good health and vitality, and design foods to achieve this backed up by fact.\\" Early career In 2000, The Food Doctor launched its first nutritionally driven dried food product Original Seed Mix, with a further 36 products added to the range in 2002; Tesco immediately took it on.Tesco calls in The Food Doctor to boost its health product The Grocer, 19 January 2002 The range was extended to over 50 items. The various food products in the range were designed to adhere to a set of nutritional principles, and were stocked by several multiples in the UK, including J Sainsbury, Tesco, Waitrose and Asda. Marber stepped down The Food Doctor 1 January 2012 and is working as an independent nutrition, food and health consultant. Television shows In 2002 Marber became a regular guest on the Channel 4 show Richard and Judy. Over a period of 7 years he would discuss relevant news features, and viewers dieting concerns with hosts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan. In the final year of the show Marber presented two ten-week strands, 'House Calls' and 'Fat Boys Slim' which culminated in 5 overweight viewers losing weight and performing 'The Full Monty' on the final show of Richard and Judy on Channel 4. Marber's television career was given a boost in 2005 with The Discovery Home & Health Channel running a 15-part show, 'The A-List Diet'. The show was well received and gained a solid fan base, seeing some repeats over the weekend. The show was subsequently shown on the Discovery Home & Health channel in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Sunday Mirror described the diet as a \\"seven-day detox‚Ä¶ eating five small meals a day which are a mixture of carbs and protein to keep blood- sugar levels steady and hunger pangs at bay.\\" Publications Marber's first big publishing break came in 1999 through Collins and Brown who were in the process of creating a health division. The book was titled The Food Doctor: Healing Foods for the Mind and Body and co- authored with Vicki Edgson a fellow I.O.N graduate. ‚ÄúTo date the book has sold in excess of 500 000 copies, a third of which has been in the US. The book has been translated into Spanish, Slovenian, Norwegian, French, Russian and Swedish.‚Äù The success of the first book accelerated the public profile of the brand and two further publications followed shortly on its heels: The Food Doctor in the City (his first solo book) and In Bed with The Food Doctor, once again co-authored with Vicki Edgson. The Food Doctor brand has not been without controversy in the media, for the liberal use of the word \\"doctor\\". In 2004, he was publicly criticised by science writer and GP Ben Goldacre (author of The Guardian newspapers weekly 'Bad Science' column), for being in the running for an \\"Award for outstanding innovation in the use of the title \\"Doctor\\"‚Äù. Although it was acknowledged that Marber did not actually use or claim the title of Dr when consulting. Nonetheless this misappropriation of the word doctor also caught the interest of the Nutrition Society who felt it was \\"misleading\\". However The Food Doctor brand remained safe, with the ASA agreeing to its trademark usage. Marber followed this with a series of books about weight loss although he was initially reluctant to write about diet working with publishers Dorling Kindersley. The series included four books which were eventually published as one in 2008 (The Food Doctor Ultimate Diet). His publication on Supereating published in 2008 by Quadrille, focuses on getting more from your food. This booked was well received by the media with stellar reviews from the women's magazine Marie Claire (February 2009), further reviews were cited by other UK newspapers. The publication in 2010, How Not To Get Fat addresses dieting from a completely different angle with Marber addressing the psychological side of dieting alongside people's emotional relationships with food. In January 2011, Marber's book was published by Quadrille, How Not To Get Fat;Your Daily Diet which included a hundred recipes by Carolyn Humphries, a former Head Chef, and prolific food writer. In May 2014 Ian Marber published Eat Your Way to Lower Cholesterol co- authored with Dr Laura Corr, consultant cardiologist at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals with recipes by Dr Sarah Scheneker.http://www.ianmarber.com/books/ April 2019 saw the publication of Manfood, a ‚Äòno nonsense‚Äô guide to nutrition for men in the 40s and upwards.

History This stone farmhouse was built by John Littig, a French immigrant who served as the carriage driver for Antoine LeClaire, one of the founders and an early promoter of the city of Davenport. He had previously worked for Harvey Leonard who was a local contractor and brick manufacturer. This was the third farm that Littig owned in Scott County, Iowa. It grew to become the largest farm in the county and was known as a show place. with The family was noted for their hospitality and their locally produced wines. The City of Davenport bought and renovated the house in the mid-1970s. It serves as a meeting place for qualified organizations. Architecture The Gothic Revival style was used extensively in church architecture in Davenport, but sparingly in domestic architecture. The Littig houses exemplifies how it was commonly used in houses in the city. It utilizes the Gothic roof shape found in the steep front gable and a few decorative porch brackets. They are combined on a house that exhibits elements found in the Georgian Revival/Federal and the Greek Revival styles. These are found in the symmetry of the five-bay main block. Another neoclassical feature is the structure itself is composed of rubble stone that was plastered and then scored to resemble ashlar construction. This was even carried out on the kitchen wing in the back. The house also features a double-door main entrance that is capped by a transom, a modillion cornice and dressed stone quoins.

Both its Hawaiian and its English name allude to a legend about Pehe, the beautiful daughter of a local chief, whose jealous husband, Makakehau ('Misty Eyes' clouded by her beauty), confined her to a nearby cave facing the open ocean. When a storm arose while he was away fetching fresh water for her, high seas flooded the cave and drowned her before he could return to rescue her.

This is a broad concept encompassing various intellectual or cognitive deficits, including intellectual disability (formerly called mental retardation), deficits too mild to properly qualify as intellectual disability, various specific conditions (such as specific learning disability), and problems acquired later in life through acquired brain injuries or neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Many of these disabilities have an effect on memory, which is the ability to recall what has been learned over time. Typically memory is moved from sensory memory to working memory, and then finally into long-term memory. People with cognitive disabilities typically will have trouble with one of these types of memory. Intellectual disability Intellectual disability, also known as general learning disability,Special Education Support Service General Learning Disabilities and previously known as mental retardation (a term now considered offensive), is a generalized disorder characterized by significantly impaired cognitive functioning and deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that appears before adulthood. It has historically been defined as an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) score under 70, but the definition now includes both one component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environment, so IQ is not the only factor. Intellectual disability must have appeared in the developmental period, not only as an adult. By contrast, people with cognitive impairment have, or previously had, normal IQ, but now show confusion, forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating; cognitive impairment is typical of brain injuries, side effects from medications, and dementia. Specific learning disability A specific learning disability is a classification including several disorders in which a person has difficulty learning in a typical manner, usually caused by an unknown factor or factors, but sometimes caused by stroke or other medical problems. Specific learning disabilities include dyslexia and developmental coordination disorder and other disorders of psychological development. Unlike other intellectual disabilities, it is not indicative of general intelligence level, and many experts consequently do not consider it to be a true intellectual disability. Rather, people with a specific learning disability have trouble performing specific types of cognitive skills or if taught in conventional ways. A specific learning disability cannot be cured or fixed, but the effects can be mitigated by the use of different learning strategies. Individuals with specific learning disabilities face some challenges throughout life. Social support can be a crucial component for students with specific learning disabilities in the school system. With the right support and intervention, people with specific learning disabilities can succeed in school and be successful later in life. Conversely, many individuals who have struggled at school or who were considered 'lazy' or 'stupid' at school, may have had unrecognised specific learning disability instead of character flaws or low IQ. Acquired brain injuries An acquired brain injury (ABI) is brain damage caused by events after birth, rather than as part of a genetic or congenital disorder. It usually affects cognitive, physical, emotional, social or independent functioning. ABIs can result from either a traumatic brain injury or a non-traumatic injury such as stroke, infection or substance abuse. Most definitions of ABI exclude neurodegenerative disorders. People with a brain injury may have difficulty controlling, coordinating and communicating their thoughts and actions. They may or may not retain their intellectual abilities, depending on the type and extent of the injury. However, the intellectual abilities of a person with a brain injury are likely to be interfered with by the resulting thought coordination and communication difficulties, which can make it difficult for them to express themselves in a manner intelligible to others. This may give the false impression of a damaged intelligence even in people with normal intellectual capacity. Neurodegenerative diseases Neurodegenerative diseases all involve the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including the death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. As research progresses, many similarities appear which relate these diseases to one another on a sub- cellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. Dementia is a serious loss of cognitive ability in a previously unimpaired person, beyond what might be expected from normal aging. Both dementia and intellectual disability are defined by neurologists as having an IQ that is two standard deviations below median (below about 70, when 100 is the median); the difference between these two classifications for intellectual disability is whether the low IQ represents a lifelong condition (intellectual disability), or a condition that is acquired later (dementia). Dementia may be static, the result of a unique global brain injury, or progressive, resulting in long-term decline due to damage or disease in the body. In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, whose symptoms of dementia are called mild cognitive impairment, the person typically loses 8 to 10 IQ points per year, with the result that a person of previously normal intelligence usually becomes intellectually disabled in less than five years. Living with cognitive disability Research documents the importance of providing those with intellectual disabilities alternative spaces and contexts where they feel included and can assert their own definitions of ability and what it is to be \\"normal.\\" References Category:Intellectual disability Category:Cognitive disorders ","title":"Disabilities affecting intellectual abilities"},{"id":"29907269","text":"The McKinney House is a historic building located on the east side of Davenport, Iowa, United States.

Johan Evertsen (1 February 1600 ‚Äì 5 August 1666) was an admiral who was born in the 17th century.  Early life  Like his five brothers, Evertsen started his military career as a lieutenant after the death of his father, \\"Captain Jan\\". He quickly moved through the ranks, fighting battles with corsairs and protecting Dutch ships from other privateers. Evertsen was eventually promoted to the rank of admiral during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Despite Evertsen's successes and influence in the Dutch Navy, his abilities were questioned due to rumours that he was a coward. Career Evertsen was born in Vlissingen. He was the eldest (surviving) son of Johan Evertsen, also known as Captain Jan who died in 1617 fighting near La Rochelle against a French corsair. In gratitude for the services he rendered, all five sons of Captain Jan were named lieutenants by the Admiralty of Zeeland. At age 18, he was made captain of a ship. He fought near La Rochelle in 1625 under Willem de Zoete, and in 1626 and 1627 in a campaign against the Barbary Coast under Laurens Reael. Between 1628 and 1636, he distinguished himself while fighting the Dunkirk corsairs. His greatest successes were in 1628, when he prevented the Dunkirkers from intercepting the captured treasure fleet of Piet Heyn and in 1636, when he captured corsair Jacob Collaert. He also played an important part in the Dutch victory in the Battle of the Slaak against the Spanish. In the wake of this battle, he came into conflict with Witte Corneliszoon de With, and receive no other important commands. During this time, he developed a friendship with stadtholders Frederick Henry and William II. First Anglo-Dutch War At the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War, Evertsen was left aside by de With, who considered him an orangist. But after de With's defeat in the Battle of the Kentish Knock, de With was replaced by Maarten Tromp, who reinstated Evertsen as a squadron commander. Evertsen helped to achieve victory in the Battle of Dungeness, extricating Tromp's flagship from an English attack. In 1653, he fought the last Battle of Portland and Battle of the Gabbard. The final Battle of Scheveningen was also lost and Tromp was killed in battle. Evertsen's ship was so badly damaged that he had to withdraw and leave the command to de With. Because he withdrew, Evertsen was accused of cowardice by de With, and he received no commands for the next 5 years. In May 1659, Evertsen sailed under Michiel de Ruyter in the fleet that assisted Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam in reconquering the Danish islands after they had been lost in the Battle of the Sound, in which de With was killed. Second Anglo-Dutch War Despite his age, Johan Evertsen was third in command of the fleet that faced the English in the Battle of Lowestoft. The battle went horribly wrong for the Dutch, and the first and second in command, Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam and Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, were killed. Evertsen became commander, but the confusion in the Dutch fleet was so great, that Cornelius Tromp did the same. By evening, the Dutch fleet was in full flight. Evertsen was summoned to The Hague. When he travelled there, he was dragged from his carriage by an angry mob, mistreated, bound hand and foot, and thrown into the water. He saved himself by clinging to the stern of a ship. He had to be escorted for his protection by an armed detachment to Den Helder, where he was tried for cowardice. The commanders of the fleet spoke out in his favour, and when it became clear that Evertsen had prevented the worst possible scenario by covering the retreat of the fleet, receiving 150 bullet impacts in his ship, he was released. When Johan's brother Cornelis Evertsen the Elder was killed in the Four Days' Battle, Johan joined the fleet and took command of the vanguard of De Ruyter. He was killed on the first day of the St James's Day Battle. After much conflict between the Admiralty and the family over the costs, both brothers were buried in 1681 in the Abbey of Middelburg, where their shared grave memorial remains. Tomb monument of Johan and Cornelis Evertsen in Middelburg Personal life Johan married Maayken Gorcum (1600‚Äì1671).

The larvae or maggots feed on the roots of various plants in the family Brassicaceae. Morphology and biology This species resembles the closely related cabbage root fly in appearance though it is slightly larger at seven to eight millimetres long. The body is light gray and the yellowish wings are transparent with yellow veins. Over most of its range, there is only one generation of this fly each year. The eggs are laid seven to ten days after the adult has emerged from the pupa. They are white and cigar-shaped and are laid in groups of thirty or forty eggs at the root collar of the host plant or on the ground nearby. Often several females lay eggs on one plant. The glossy white or yellow larvae hatch in five to fourteen days. They feed for about forty days, moulting three times, eating the young roots or tunneling into the main root of the host plantAgroAtlas or even penetrating into the basal part of the leaves of hearting cabbage. The pupae are brown and about six millimetres in length. The insect overwinters as a pupa in the ground at a depth of five centimetres or more.HYPP Zoology The pupae can endure frosts of -33 ¬∞C and in the following year the adults emerge at varying dates, doing so when the soil temperature reaches 18 ¬∞C at the depth of the pupae. Distribution The turnip root fly is found in Western Europe, Russia, Northeast China, Korea, Japan and North America. Economic significance The larvae damage the roots of cabbage, turnip, radish, swede and other cruciferous crops. The growth of damaged plants is slow and development is poor resulting in a reduced yield. Large scale attacks cause cessation of growth with the plants exhibiting a leaden hue and wilting, subsequently turning yellow and dying. Control measures include the early planting of strong plants, the use of peat-compost pots, the use of additional fertilizer, deep autumn ploughing after the harvesting of cruciferous crops and insecticide treatments.

History This house was built for Thomas C. Wilkinson, who had been a bricklayer in St. Louis, Missouri. He retired to Davenport in 1854 and moved to Rose Hill Farm. He had this house built in 1860. His wife was Ellen McManus Atkinson whose father was Judge James McManus, and he lived on a farm just to the east. On Christmas Eve in 1876, Wilkinson committed suicide in the house. Architecture The Thomas C. Wilkinson House is an Italian Villa style home that sits on a large lot high above street level. The two-story house is frame construction with a front gable, L-plan main block. It features a three-stage, square tower. The third level is not original to the house. The windows on the west wing appear to be from the turn of the 20th-century and suggest this portion of the house was built later than the rest of the structure. The house features a bracketed cornice on the main block, an entrance porch with a spindle frieze and wrought iron railings. The main fa√ßade has two round-arched windows on both levels. The lower level windows are taller than the upper-level windows and they all feature muntins. There are two circular windows above the ground level in the basement.

Biography Tom Ardolino was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts. A fan of the band, he began corresponding and trading tapes with keyboardist and co-founder Terry Adams. This led to him meeting and befriending the band. At one live show, when original NRBQ drummer Tom Staley did not return for an encore, Adams invited Ardolino to fill in. He performed well enough that when Staley left the band in 1974, his bandmates agreed that Ardolino was the natural choice as successor.Simons, Julian , \\"Modern Drummer\\", July, 2005, accessed December 5, 2010. Ardolino remained in the lineup until the band went on hiatus in 2004, returning for occasional performances with Adams, and contributing to solo recordings by Adams (Rhythm Spell and Holy Tweet), by NRBQ (Keep This Love Going and We Travel the Spaceways) and others (see Selected Discography). While lead vocals were generally performed by other members of NRBQ, live shows often included a moment where Ardolino would take the spotlight and sing, either with a karaoke backing track or with one of the other band members drumming. Ardolino's solo album Unknown Brain was released in 2004 on CD by Bumble Bee Records, Japan and on vinyl LP in the USA on Mystra Records. The album consists mostly of basement recordings made in 1971-72. The cover states \\"WARNING: If out-of-tuneness bothers you, do not listen.\\" He was also an avid collector of song poems, and initiated the \\"MSR Madness\\" series of compilations. Ardolino appeared in a promotional video to campaign for the world premiere of The Simpsons Movie in his hometown of Springfield. Tom Ardolino died on January 6, 2012 at a Springfield, Massachusetts hospital; this was reported on the NRBQ Headquarters page on Facebook.https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/NRBQ-Headquarters/221489064545160 A later article from the Washington Post specified the cause as diabetes.

Unlike most Vitis vinifera wine grapes, Alicante Ganzin is a teinturier with dark flesh that produces red juice.

Post-transplant recognition of alloantigens occurs in secondary lymphoid organs. Donor specific antigens are recognized by recipient‚Äôs T lymphocytes and triggers adaptive pro-inflammatory response which consequently leads to rejection of allogenic transplants. Allospecific T lymphocytes may be stimulated by three major pathways: direct recognition, indirect recognition or semidirect recognition. The pathway involved in specific cases is dictated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors of allograft and directly influence nature and magnitude of T lymphocytes mediated immune response. Furthermore, variant tissues and organs such as skin or cornea or solid organ transplants can be recognized in different pathways and therefore are rejected in different fashion. __TOC__ Direct alloantigen recognition Population of antigen presenting cells (APCs) is localized inside donor‚Äôs tissues and is co-transferred from donor to recipient via transplant procedure. This population is therefore called ‚Äúpassenger cells‚Äù. Short after transplantation to new host these cells (especially dendritic cells) leave their intra-graft habitat and migrate through lymphatic system to regional lymphatic nodes. Inside the lymphatic nodes these dendritic cells are confronted with recipient‚Äôs na√Øve T lymphocytes and their contact culminate in recognition of allogenic MHC (major histocompatibility complex)- peptide complex displayed on the surface of the passenger cells. This phenomenon is called direct recognition and leads to acute rejection of allografts mediated by specialized CD4+T lymphocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes. In this case, alloreactive T cells are stimulated by donor APCs which express both the allogeneic MHC and costimulatory activity. Indirect alloantigen recognition Second route of allorecognition mimics normal antigen mechanism of T lymphocytes stimulation by nominal antigens. In this case the alloantigens derived from graft are internalized, processed and presented in form of peptides by recipient‚Äôs APCs on their MHC II molecules. Rejection mediated by T lymphocytes sensitized by direct allorecognition pathway is predominant in the short period after the transplantation, but usually subsides with depletion of passenger cells while indirect recognition contributes to continuing graft damage and plays role in chronic rejection. The main difference between indirect and direct alloantigen recognition stems from the origin of the macrophages (type of APC). In direct alloantigen recognition, the involved dendritic cells are donor derived. In indirect alloantigen recognition, the dendritic cells (APCs) involved are recipient APCs.  Semi-direct alloantigen recognition (cross-dressing)  The third pathway of recognition also involve donor APCs, but in this case are their membrane components fused with recipient APCs and therefore can present intact donor MHC molecules to the host. This is possible by unique ability to exchange molecules such as RNA or proteins which is well established among leukocytes. There are several possibilities how this can be achieved: cell- cell contact (trogocytosis), nanotubes or release of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. Myeloid antigen presenting cells and dendritic cells in particular are one of the major exosome producers. There are known especially for their ability to transport functional MHC molecules with bonded antigen peptide (pMHC) to different cells population including other dendritic cells. In consequence these dendritic cells which acquired new pMHC, displayed on their surface, became ‚Äúcross-dressed‚Äù. This pMHC is capable of normal antigen presentation to effectors cells. Usually, the mechanism of cross-dressing serves purposes of amplifying immune response to certain antigens, but in case of alloantigen recognition the APCs are able, thanks to this mechanism, to prime both direct and indirect T lymphocytes by expressing both self- MHC and allo- MHC peptides derived from donor passenger APCs. Semi-direct alloantigen recognition therefore contributes to acute rejection by eliciting response of specialized CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.

She is recorded as having performed with her partner at various public houses, theatres being few and far between, such as in 1795 at the Black Bottle Inn at Muirkirk and other small places of entertainment up and down the country, including Irvine as well as Kilmarnock at the 'Croft Lodge' where she was famed for singing 'Green grow the rushes'. Other contemporaries are recorded as having said that she was merely \\"a roughly hardened tramp, a wilful, regardless woman.\\"Dictionary of National Biography A contact of the author James Paterson told him that she had seen Jean Glover \\"gally attired and playing on a tambourine at the mouth of a close, in which was the exhibition room of her husband the conjurer\\", and thought her \\"the bravest woman I had ever seen step in leather shoon.\\" A few months prior to her death a final 'sighting' is known of her performing at Letterkenny in County Donegal, Ireland, in apparent good health. However, she died only a few months later. Association with Robert Burns Burns took a surprisingly negative view of Jean Glover, explaining how he came to collect \\"O'er the moor amang the heather\\", although we cannot be sure that she did in fact compose the song : \\"This song is the composition of a Jean Glover, a girl who was not only a whore but also a thief; and in one or other character has visited most of the correction houses in the west. She was born, I believe, in Kilmarnock. I took the song down from her singing as she was strolling the country with a slight of hand blackguard\\". Full view of the Naysmith portrait of 1787, Scottish National Portrait Gallery It has been suggested that the song is based on the Scots ballad \\"The Laird o' Drum\\", but little evidence can be found for this in any published collections.

William Walker (9 January 1871 ‚Äì 23 November 1918) was a prominent Irish trade unionist.  Early Life  Born at 35 McCluny Street, Belfast, on 9 January 1871 to Francis Walker, a boilermaker, and his wife, Sarah McLaughlin. He was educated at Saint George's National School, Belfast.  Politics  Walker became a joiner at Harland and Wolff and quickly became active in the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners. He was elected as their delegate to the Belfast Trades Council in 1893,The Irish Labour Movement in the Nineteenth Century, John W. Boyle, (Washington DC, 1998). where he led movements towards new unionism, organising both manual workers in the shipyards and female linen workers. He was a founding member of the Independent Labour Party and spoke in favour of socialism regularly from Belfast Customs House steps.\\"Walker, William\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1904, Walker was elected to Belfast Corporation, representing Duncairn. In the same year, he served as President of the Irish Trades Union Congress. He stood for the Labour Representation Committee in Belfast North at both the 1905 by-election and 1906 general election, losing by fewer than 500 votes on each occasion. During the former election he said he would, \\"Make an effort to obtain a redistribution of Parliamentary seats for the purpose of diminishing the extravagant representation of Ireland by means of which the Roman Catholics and disloyal party has hindered the business of the House of Commons.\\" This was criticized by Marxist James Connolly, who accused him of bigotry. Future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Ramsey MacDonald, was the election agent for Walker during the same election in 1905. Walker espoused religious socialism stating, ‚ÄúProtestantism means protesting against superstition, hence true Protestantism is synonymous with labour.\\" In 1911 Walker wrote, \\"Though I admire Karl Marx, he is not a deity to me,\\" Walker was also an internationalist, stating, \\"My place of birth was accidental, but my duty to my class is worldwide, hence MY INTERNATIONALISM!\\" In an attempt to counter opposition from the Belfast Protestant Association, he proclaimed his opposition to Irish home rule. At the 1907 by-election he stood again, but his share of the vote fell back. However, he was elected to the executive of the British Labour Party. Though he opposed home rule he stated in 1911, \\"I would give each locality (within certain well-defined limits) local autonomy, and thus develop a healthy rivalry in the supply of those amenities to our municipal life.\\" As he became increasingly well known in Britain, Walker contested the January 1910 general election as the Labour Party candidate for Leith Burghs, but took a distant third place. In 1911, he undertook a debate with James Connolly in which he argued that Irish socialists should focus their activities on the British labour movement. However, the following year, he took a local government position related to health insurance which required him to withdraw from political activity.

The name comes from the fact that those born during this time were too young to have served in the military during World War I, and were generally too old to serve as enlisted personnel in World War II, although many of them could indeed be found in the armed forces in some capacity during the latter conflict. Members of this generation came of age either during the Roaring Twenties or the initial phase of the Great Depression, prior to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the promulgation of the New Deal. This fact contributed to the core of this generation holding lifelong left-liberal views in politics, especially on economic issues, although a few prominent dissenters (such as Barry Goldwater) do stand out. Most of their children belong to the Silent Generation. The four Presidents of the United States of the Interbellum Generation were Lyndon B. Johnson (born in 1908), Ronald Reagan (born in 1911) and Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford (both born in 1913). (However, all four served in World War II with members of the Greatest Generation.)

Mrs Booty was very much displeased and went to court about it. The Judge asked Mrs Booty what time her husband died.

The Terloy (also Terlo, Teroy) (Chechen: –¢I–µ—Ä–ª–æ–π, –¢I–µ—Ä–æ–π) is a Chechen teip. The exact population of the teip is not known, however it is estimated to be around 30,000 people. Terloy speak in the Itum- Kali dialect of the Chechen language. Chechen writer and poet Magomet Mamakaev defined the Terloy as a Tukkhum in his works, however literature, material and legends by the Terloy themselves are proof that they are in fact a larger teip, with all the typical characteristics of a Chechen teip. Etymology The name Terloy comes from the geographical place of origin. Ter- meaning \\"upper\\" and -loy which indicates to belonging to a group or place. History The Terloy originate from Terloy-Mohk, an area in the south-western mountains of Chechnya. There are no people living there after February 1944. All villages were destroyed by Soviet government and was forbidden to live there because the region was considered as rebellious and dangerous. Nowadays the majority of the Terloy tribe reside in the western part of Chechnya, in the Groznensky District, Achkhoy-Martanovsky District, Urus-Martanovsky District, Akhmeta Municipality of Georgia and in some villages in Ingushetia. In 1994 in the beginning of First Chechen War there were formed some groups by the Terloy to fight the Russian aggression. There was also one regiment organized by the people of the Galanchozhsky District called \\"Galanchozhan Polk\\" but was mostly composed of Terloy, because the leader of the regiment was a Terloy. ¬´–î–∏–π–Ω–∞—á—É –Ω–µ—Ö–∞–Ω –±—É—å–π–¥–∞ –±I–∞—å—Ä–≥–∞—à –¥–∏–∏–Ω–∞ –º–∞I-–¢I–µ—Ä–ª–æ–π¬ª - Terloy, who ate uncooked eyes of alive people.

He advanced early important arguments in favor of artificial ventilation for the treatment of asphyxia over alternative resuscitation measures of the time, like heat and exsanguination. In addition, Goodwyn was the first to refute claims that pulmonary circulation stopped during exhalation. Life Edmund Goodwyn belonged to a yeoman family that settled in Framlingham, United Kingdom, at the beginning of the seventeenth century. He was baptized there on 2 December 1756, only a few months before the death of his young father. He began his medical career by completing a six year apprenticeship with John Page (1730‚Äì1794), a surgeon from the neighboring town of Woodbridge. As a medical student at the University of Edinburgh between 1779 and 1786, Goodwyn was influenced by medical luminaries like William Cullen (1710‚Äì1790), Joseph Black (1728‚Äì1799), and Alexander Monro Secundus (1733‚Äì1817). He befriended Thomas Beddoes (1760‚Äì1808), a fellow medical student who dedicated his book of John Mayow‚Äôs (1640‚Äì1679) work on air and respiration to Goodwyn. Goodwyn dedicated his own work on the physiological aspects of drowning to his medical school friend Johannes Theodorus Van der Kemp (1747‚Äì1811) who ironically would later watch his wife and daughter drown as his boat capsized during a thunderstorm. Goodwyn also dedicated the English translation of his thesis to John Page. A few lines of Memoirs of Chateaubriand Vol II suggest that Goodwyn practiced medicine in London, where Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand (1768‚Äì1848) sought his expertise for a pulmonary malady. Chateaubriand wrote: ‚ÄúDr. Goodwyn, famous for his experiments on drowning people‚Ä¶assisted me with his advice gratis. But he said to me, with the harshness that he employed towards himself, that I might ‚Äòlast‚Äô a few months, perhaps one or two years, provided I gave up all fatigue.‚Äù In a footnote, Chateaubriand suggests that Goodwyn was ‚Äúthe original of William Makepeace Thackeray‚Äôs (1811‚Äì1863) [legendary character] Dr. Goodenough.‚Äù Goodwyn died in Framlingham in 1829. An inscription on the nave of the Framlingham church above his remains reads: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Powerful as was his intellect, and various as were his attainments, he was even more distinguished by his benevolent simplicity of heart and unaffected piety.‚Äù His portrait is archived at the National Portrait Gallery in London. Works During the interim between the mid 1700s and the early 1900s many physicians lost confidence in their ability to pronounce death. This phenomenon was in part sparked by Jacques-B√©nigne Winslow‚Äôs (1669‚Äì1760) The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death and the Danger of Precipitate Interments and Dissections, published in 1740, which claimed the existence of death-like state often referred to as ‚Äúsuspended animation.‚Äù In addition, it argued that victims to these conditions should not be pronounced dead, nor buried, until their bodies demonstrated overt putrefaction. Goodwyn's graduation thesis vehemently refutes these concepts. His experimental work aimed to identify the physiological hallmark of drowning, which he accomplished by removing the sternum from cats, dogs, rabbits, toads, and lizards in order to observe the changes in blood color inside the pulmonary arteries and veins during conditions of asphyxia. He confirmed previous reports that the chemical process that turned ‚Äúblack‚Äù blood (i.e., deoxygenated blood) into ‚Äúflorid‚Äù blood (i.e., oxygenated blood) was halted by different causes of asphyxia, and was the first to observe that this anomaly occurred consistently during drowning, even if only a very small amount of water entered the lungs. Thus he was the first to conclude that water did not cause drowning directly by damaging the lungs, but indirectly, by excluding atmospheric air from them. In some experiments Goodwyn even used a blow pipe to ventilate the lungs of lifeless, experimentally drowned, toads and lizards, inducing their \\"black\\" pulmonary blood to become florid, and their hearts to resume beating. Based on these results he wrote: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it appears, that there is a striking impropriety in the terms, which are commonly employed‚Ä¶ viz. ‚Äòsuspended animation,‚Äô‚Ä¶ because they lead mankind to believe themselves capable of reanimating or resuscitating a lifeless mass, when they only cure a disease.‚Äù Unfortunately, despite Goodwyn‚Äôs early admonition, suspended animation and its mystical implications persisted well into the early 1900s. Thus Goodwyn provided experimental evidence to support the use of artificial ventilation over alternative resuscitation methods of the time, which included heat, electricity, exsanguination, tobacco smoke, and the application of various vapors and creams to the skin and intestines. He based his arguments on actual comparisons between the efficacy of such methods and that of artificial ventilation. He wrote:‚Äú‚Ä¶if we allow to these remedies all the efficacy that partiality can claim, it can only be said, that they sometimes produce by indirect means, what may be always done directly by [artificial lung inflation] ‚Ä¶‚Äù In addition, Goodwyn disproved the notion that pulmonary blood flow slowed to a halt during the exhalation phase of respiration by demonstrating that the volume of air expired during a normal respiratory cycle was too small to reshape the lungs to a degree that impedes blood flow. Goodwyn wrote: ‚ÄúTo suppose‚Ä¶ that the angles of these vessels are changed although the form of the lungs continues the same is contrary to one of the fundamental principles of geometry.‚Äù He concluded: ‚Äú‚Ä¶blood circulates through the pulmonary vessels in all the degrees of natural respiration.‚Äù His work was acknowledged by the eminent French anatomist Xavier Bichat (1771‚Äì1802) in his book Recherches physiologiques sur la vie et la mort. Goodwyn's work earned a gold medal from the Royal Humane Society of London in 1788. His discovery of the diving reflex was erroneously attributed to Paul Bert (1833‚Äì1886) for nearly one-hundred fifty years before it was finally credited to him.

It stands about southwest of the northeastern tip of the island. It is the tallest lighthouse in Queensland. Built in 1870, it is the second major lighthouse to be built in Queensland after its formation in 1859. It is one of the first lighthouses in Australia to be constructed using bolted prefabricated segments of cast iron, and one of only two such lighthouses in Queensland, the other being its sibling, Bustard Head Light. History The Government of Queensland was formed in 1859. In 1862, the Queensland government appointed the first Portmaster, Commander George Poynter Heath. However, it was only in 1864 that two committees were appointed to deal with the issue of coastal lighthouses. The only location for which both committees were in clear agreement about the need of a lighthouse was Sandy Cape. The site was also strongly recommended by Joseph Brady, Queensland Engineer for Harbours and Rivers of the time, on a tour of inspection he did in 1865. An order for the prefabricated tower was placed with Kitson & Co. of Leeds, England, the design being done by William Pole of Kitson & Co. The lantern and apparatus were ordered from Chance Brothers of Birmingham, England, and by 1867 all the materials have arrived at Brisbane. The winning tender for the construction of the tower was of ¬£4524 by the brothers John and Jacob Rooney of Maryborough, Sandy Cape Light being the first of several lighthouses they constructed, to be followed by Cape Bowling Green Light, Cowan Cowan Point Light, Cape Capricorn Light, Lady Elliot Island Light and Booby Island Light. The whim used for pulling materials to the lighthouse, c. 1903 The materials from Brisbane and cement from Sydney were brought by ship, unloaded into barges, and then pulled by horses in trolleys on a wooden rail, rising . Materials were then raised the final by a horse-powered whim. It was originally planned that the light will be the first to be constructed by the new Queensland government. However, it was beaten by Bustard Head Light, constructed in 1868. Sandy Cape light was finally officially lit in May 1870. The original apparatus was a revolving first order Chance Brothers apparatus which showed a light characteristic of one white flash every two minutes, visible for . The light source was an Argand lamp fueled by Colza oil or Rapeseed oil. Rotation was achieved by a clockwork mechanism that had to be wound regularly. Also built in the station were quarters for the head keeper and three assistant keepers, and their families, built of timber framed weather board and iron roofs. In 1875, the light source was changed to Kerosene. In 1915, the station was transferred to the Commonwealth. The light was upgraded in 1917 and again in 1923. In one of these upgrades when the light source was converted to an incandescent mantle using vaporised kerosene. upright In the 1930s states 1930. states \\"Probably 1936\\". The exact date is probably related with the rebuilding of the quarters for which states 1933 while and state 1935. It is also related with the conversion to electricity for which states \\"in the 1930s\\". the lens was replaced with a 4th order Chance Brothers lens and the lighthouse was converted to electrical operation. Around that time The keepers' cottages were rebuilt and most of the other buildings at the premises were constructed. Septic tanks were only installed in the 1960s. A boarded roadway was constructed in the 1970s and a brick engine room was built in 1974. The kitchens were renovated in the 1980s. In 1995, the lighthouse was converted to solar power and automated,. lists April 1991. and the 4th order lens was replaced with a VRB-25 apparatus. In 1997, the station was finally demanned,. lists April 1994. and was transferred back to the Queensland Government, to be administered by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which employs a ranger in the premises. A remote area power supply (RAPS) for powering the quarters was installed in 2001, with both solar and wind power sources and a diesel generator for backup, though the wind turbine is unused since October 2002. Current display The current characteristic is one white flash every ten seconds (Fl.W. 10 s), visible for .List of Lights The light source is a 100 Watt 10 Volt VRB-25 lantern, with an intensity of 160,000 cd. The power source is a photovoltaic system (a battery charged by solar power). General arrangement of the tower, 1865 Structures The tower The lighthouse is round conical in form, standing high. It is constructed of prefabricated cast iron plates, and painted white, with splayed flanges at the base standing on a concrete base foundation. The diameter at the base is approximately ,. states 8 m. tapering to about at the top, below the lantern. Internally it has five floors, connected by a spiral iron staircase with cast iron steps, adjoined to the internal walls. The lighthouse has two entrances, one at the bottom and one about above the ground, accessible by an outside staircase supported on brackets. The bottom entrance provides access to the ground floor, where a display of various maritime artefacts resides, including the 4th order Chance Brothers lens. The top entrance leads to the main tower. The words \\"\\"Kitson & Co LEEDS 1866\\" are cast above the doorway. The tower is topped by a cantilevered iron balcony with a simple iron balustrade. On top of the balcony is the lantern room, with a cast iron catwalk supported on ornate iron brackets. The lantern room is constructed of cast iron, topped by a domed roof clad with copper sheeting and painted bright red. Other buildings The Sandy Cape Lightstation A workshop and some other associated structures surround the lighthouse. The residences at the station consist of two one-story lighthouse keeper's houses flanking the lighthouse, one for the head keeper and one for the assistant keeper. They are timber-framed and fibro clad, with timber cover battens and timber door and window frames. Windows have a fixed upper pane with sliding sash below and louvers. Near the residences are a fowl yard and a shelter. A group of service buildings, including a powerhouse, a garage and bulk fuel store are located about southeast of the lighthouse. The workshop, office and garage are timber-framed with painted fibre cement and cover battens, and were all built with the residences. The more recent powerhouse and inflammable liquid store are constructed of bricks and have a concrete foundation, a hipped stainless steel roof, with central vent and metal door and window frames. Also on the premises is a small picket fenced cemetery to the south of the station, with several stone headstones. Site operation and visiting The light is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, while the site is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service as part of the Great Sandy National Park. The island can be reached by ferry from Hervey Bay or Inskip Point north of Rainbow Beach, or by chartered flight via Maroochydore Airport. The station is accessible either by four-wheel drive or by a long hike. Heritage listing The light was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1998.

It was owned and operated by the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company and therefore did not have its own official name. Over the years, it has been known by at least four different names. (A report prepared by the State in the 1880s referred to it as both the \\"Black Diamond Coal Mining Railroad Company\\" and the \\"Black Diamond Railroad.\\" It has also been referred to as the \\"Black Diamond Coal Company Railroad\\" and the \\"Black Diamond Coal and Railroad Company.\\"B. H. Ward, Mt. Diablo Coal Mine Railroads, The Western Railroader, Booklet 370-E.) The railroad was built by Gold Rush- era civil engineer and artist Sherman Day, and opened for service in 1868 primarily to serve the Black Diamond Coal Mine at Nortonville. At the town of Cornwall, California the railroad crossed the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad using an overhead trestle. It was mostly standard gauge, however there was a small segment that was narrow gauge from the mine portals to coal bunkers. The railroad had four locomotives, two built in San Francisco by H. J. Booth at the Union Iron Works, Note that archive version is formatted with black text on a black background. one built in San Francisco by Vulcan Iron Works and one from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three locomotives had names: The D. O. Mills (named after Darius Ogden Mills), the Hayward (named after Alvinza Hayward), and the Black Diamond. One locomotive was a narrow-gauge engine that was used to bring mine cars from the mine portals to the bunkers. Trains ran by gravity from Nortonville to Black Diamond Landing because it was all downhill. The railroad was abandoned in about 1885 when the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company closed its mine at Nortonville and moved all of its employees to another of the Company's mines at Black Diamond, Washington Territory. In 1888, two of its locomotives, the D. O. Mills and the Black Diamond were transferred to the Bellingham Bay and British Columbia Railroad (\\"BB&BC;\\") in the state of Washington. The BB&BC; was a company that had strong ties to the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company because the two companies had the same management. The locomotive named Hayward was sold for scrap. Today, part of the old roadbed can still be seen along Nortonville Road between Pittsburg, California and Nortonville.

Four vehicles were involved, including a school bus operated by the Greene County Schools. Six students and one of the drivers were killed. The remaining 24 persons in the accident suffered injuries ranging from minor to critical. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of one of the drivers to keep his vehicle right of the center line. Contributing to that failure was the likelihood of a momentary lapse of attention caused by fatigue or an epileptic seizure.  Crash  At the time of the crash, the school bus was travelling southbound on the two- lane road, carrying twenty-six students aged 9‚Äì13 from Snow Hill Primary School and West Greene Middle School. A Military Distributors of Virginia, Inc., tractor-trailer carrying produce was traveling north. The second tractor-trailer, carrying grain, was directly behind the school bus and the passenger vehicle was behind the grain truck. The incident occurred on a curve in US 13, 2.3 miles south of Snow Hill. At approximately 3:20 pm, the driver of the northbound tractor-trailer crossed the center line and struck the school bus. The left side of the school bus was torn off. The tractor-trailer then collided with the southbound tractor-trailer and the passenger vehicle struck the rear of the southbound tractor-trailer. During the second collision, the tractor and trailer of the Military Distributors truck separated and the tractor turned over on its right side into the northbound lane. The cab burst into flames and the driver of the tractor was killed. The front of the grain trailer also caught fire but the driver of that vehicle was able to escape. The driver and passenger in the automobile sustained minor injuries. Of the twenty-six students on the school bus, five were killed outright, and a sixth died June 2 in the hospital, bringing the death toll to a total of seven. The remaining students, along with the bus driver, were injured, many critically. Three students were air-lifted to Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and the remainder were transported to Wayne County Memorial Hospital in Goldsboro, North Carolina.  Investigation  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sent a five- member team to the site of the crash. The team found that the driver of the Military Distributors tractor-trailer had, during a momentary lapse in alertness, crossed the center line into the path of the school bus. The driver was also found to have suffered from epilepsy. The Board was unable to determine whether the lapse in alertness was due to an epileptic seizure, fatigue or another factor. As a result of its investigation, the NTSB recommended that states end the \\"issuance of licenses for the operation of large commercial trucks and vehicles capable of transporting more than 10 passengers to persons with diagnosed seizure disorders.\\" It also recommended that physicians be required to report information about the identity of those with seizure disorders to the driver's license agency, and be granted legal immunity for making such reports. In addition, the NTSB recommended strengthening and increased testing of the body panel and floor joists for school buses.  Notes  The number injured or killed is given as 26 in one source and 31 in another. This article uses the NTSB figure.

Currently undergoing a closure process, its website is still in operation while content is disseminated. Its stated aims were 'to increase understanding of the impact of tourism on environments and host communities among governments, industry, civil society and tourists; and to promote tourism development that is sustainable, just and participatory, and which is founded on a respect for human rights.  History  Tourism Concern was founded in 1988 as an informal network, linking people around Britain with similar organisations elsewhere in the world. Its instigator and initial co-ordinator, Alison Stancliffe, was motivated by her experiences when teaching and travelling in South East Asia, where she became concerned that tourists were contributing to economic exploitation in poor regions of the world. Early network members included subscribers to a report commissioned by TEN - the Third World Tourism European Ecumenical Network - in 1988, 'The UK and Third World Tourism', also contacts suggested by counterpart organisations in TEN and further afield, e.g.Equitable Tourism Options(Equations)in India. In 1989 the network's 100 members formed themselves into a membership organisation. The new council of management was drawn largely from the academic and global development sectors, where much of the emerging research and concern about tourism's impact was concentrated. In 1991 Tourism Concern opened its first office in Roehampton College London and employed a worker, Tricia Barnett. Barnett remained Director until 2011, overseeing the completion of charitable status in 1994, and co-ordinating the organisation's work programmes and membership growth. After climbing to 1,000 in the early 1990s membership remained stubbornly stable, so early hopes of becoming a popular movement did not materialise. However, in contrast, the charity's influence and reputation grew steadily within the tourism and global development sectors, alongside its output of influential reports, such as 'Putting Tourism to Rights', a report on human rights abuses in the tourism industry launched at the House of Lords in London. For example, in 2009 Jonathon Porritt, Co-founder of the Forum for the Future, wrote of the organisation, \\"As ever, Tourism Concern is at the forefront of efforts to ensure that the benefits of tourism are shared much more equitably\\". Messages sent to mark Tourism Concern's 21st birthday in 2010 included this one from Justin Francis of responsibletravel.com: \\"Congratulations on 21 years of holding the tourism industry to account for its impacts on local communities and destinations! Long may you continue to tell uncomfortable truths.\\" Publications which have featured Tourism Concern's work include Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World', Leo Hickman's 'The Final Call'.'Peace through Tourism' edited by Blanchard and Higgins-Desbiolles contains a chapter on the charity's record putting human rights on the tourism agenda. Completed under its second Director, Mark Watson (2012 -2018), ‚ÄòWater Equity in Tourism‚Äô a high profile campaign funded by DFID among other sources, put tourism‚Äôs relationship to water scarcity under the spotlight and included the charity‚Äôs last of many resources for formal education, ‚ÄòWater for All‚Äô. From this point on, Tourism Concern's awareness raising and campaigning was undertaken largely online, reaching out to a global audience through its website, with over 20,000 visits in March 2013, and its e-newsletter, which had just under 10,000 subscribers worldwide in the same month. A report on labour conditions in all-inclusive hotels was launched in March 2014 at the House of Commons, following research carried out in Barbados, Kenya and Tenerife. While making typically hard hitting recommendations, the charity was also able to document changes for the better in one of the destinations, Barbados, since its previous research there almost ten years before. In 2014, facing an increasingly difficult financial climate and the loss of its free premises, Watson moved the organisation‚Äôs operations completely online, disposing of the unique library and reducing staff. These actions kept the charity afloat while it was repositioned as primarily an online promoter of responsible tourism for ethical travellers. His small team developed an online Ethical Travel Guide and worked on increasing subscribing membership of three special interest groups: ethical tour operators, voluntourism companies and an academic network. Meanwhile funding for the high quality research and campaigning work which had characterised the charity previously became increasingly hard to secure. Despite these difficulties Watson and colleagues produced a regular blog and campaign petitions; and several more reports and digital briefing papers were published before he resigned his post in March 2018. These dealt with international volunteering (July 2014), consumer perceptions of all-inclusives (January 2015), cruise tourism (March 2016), tourism and indigenous people and animals in tourism (both 2017). Members also funded a short film released online in January 2018, linking the overheated holiday rental sector with the housing crisis in Barcelona. After Watson‚Äôs departure, research on the damaging impact of uncontrolled accommodation booking platforms on city communities continued, but so did the trajectory of dwindling membership and core funding. Even so, the trustees' abrupt closure announcement in September 2018, citing intractable financial problems, took Tourism Concern‚Äôs membership, tourism professionals and human rights activists by surprise. An assessment by its founder of the wider industry and social trends that contributed to around closure was published in 2019.It was placed in an online resource archive on sustainable tourism website Travindy.com along with key reports and documents deemed to be of enduring relevance to researchers and activists engaged in addressing tourism's impacts on people and places.  Impacts on the tourism industry  Tourism Concern worked to change practice in the tourism industry and in consumer behaviour, initially through its influential quarterly, 'In Focus', and now using its website, with its campaigns evidenced by a stream of professionally researched reports. Over its lifetime it also produced extensive education resources for the formal education sector, always focusing on the experience of those affected by tourism development. All this output starts with concerns raised by host communities or by organisations working with them. Tourism Concern archive The following example illustrates Tourism Concern's approach to addressing impact issues. Following international terrorism crises in Kenya and Bali in 2002, Barnett and colleagues were alerted by partners on the ground that UK Foreign Office travel warnings advising travelers to avoid both countries were having a disastrous effect on the many Kenyan and Balinese communities dependent on tourism. Producing well documented research to back up its case, Tourism Concern succeeded in inducing the government of the UK to drop the warnings. Tourism Concern director Patricia Barnett said \\"We can no longer just stand aside and watch destinations suffer whilst they have no voice on whether British tourists can visit them or not.\\" Early campaigns include work in Goa, where Tourism Concern fought to stop much needed water from being diverted from village wells to hotels. The campaign encountered much resistance from the tourism industry, while at the same time, Tourism Concern realised that there was little or no awareness of such issues among holidaymakers at this time, encouraging campaigns to be launched, and important issues of ethics in tourism to be raised. Major achievements: * A report for the UN Rio Earth Summit in 1992 outlined principles for sustainable tourism, which led to the participation of Tourism Concern in the creation of the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria * The 1991 Himalayan Trekking Code championed responsible trekking in the Annapurna region of Nepal and was the model for the current Code for Working Conditions for Porters promoted by the International Porters Protection Group. * Unique host centred publications for students and schools contributed to the UK schools national curriculum and university courses: e.g. ‚ÄòLooking Beyond the Brochure‚Äô video teaching pack, which received the prestigiousToura d‚ÄôOr award in 2000, and online teaching package ‚ÄòWater for Everyone'. * Successful lobbying for a World Responsible Tourism Day at the World Travel Market, one of the two largest annual global travel trade shows, which takes place in London. * The adoption of policies on labour conditions for hotels, by all of the UK's leading tour operators, following a large campaign called \\"Sun, Sand, Sea and Sweatshops\\". *Pioneered on its website in the late1990s, Tourism Concern‚Äôs community tourism guide paved the way for online and print ethical travel guides offering small and independent businesses a chance to reach a worldwide clientele. *Tourism Concern's Ethical Tour Operators Group and the Ethical Volunteering Group provided new safe spaces for operators normally in competition with each other to collaborate in tackling mutually challenging issues. Noel Josephides, the Managing Director of tour operator Sunvil, said that Tourism Concern has been \\"like a small dog snapping at the heels of the industry. After years of throwing money at resorts to build rabbit-hutch hotels, the industry has finally realised that we're running out of carefully managed destinations. Tourism Concern is advising the big companies. It's working and it's worth all their effort.\\"  Campaigns and Reports Tourism Concern's first major campaign was spearheaded by a ground breaking report, 'Beyond the Green Horizon', written for the United Nations Rio conference of 1992. The aim was to get tourism recognisd as both an environmental and a development issue by the world's governments. Ten principles for sustainable tourism were listed, exemplified by case studies from Africa, Asia and Europe. An major issue highlighted was to remain live throughout Tourism Concern's thirty year history: displacement caused by tourism. A hard hitting campaign called 'Our Holidays their Homes' uncovered injustice around the world and led to a report linking tourism to human rights for the first time. Much of Tourism Concern's consequent work would touch on displacement in one form or another, such is its disastrous impact on people and places. For example, in 2004 Tsunami Tourism Concern campaigned to raise the alarm on unfair tourism development in the affected areas. Information from a subsequent tsunami related project among coastal communities in India, which was funded by DFID, played an essential part in the Water Equity in Tourism (WET) campaign, launched in 2011. The research report for this campaign drew on contacts made in India, alongside those provided by a think- tank of international NGOs brought together by Tourism Concern. Another long running strand of campaigning concerned the social and economic impacts of new trends in the tourist industry. In 2007, Tourism Concern began seriously addressing the issues for host communities raised by \\"gap year/voluntourism\\" packages. At the start of this work, Tourism Concern Director Tricia Barnett told The Times, \\"We are at a point where volunteering is dovetailing into tourism. More people want to volunteer abroad and the age group involved is getting bigger\\". The aim was to ensure that companies and NGOs offering these packages are providing genuine benefits to the recipient countries as well as to the volunteers. A specific aspect of the campaign is the documentation of the devastating impacts of 'orphanage tourism' highlighted in Tourism Concern's e-newsletter and website. In July 2014 Tourism Concern published a new report, 'International Volunteering - Filling the Gaps'.Tourism Concern,'International Volunteering - Filling the Gaps', July 2014 This highlighted good practice for prospective volunteers and best practice for companies offering volunteering holidays. Alongside the report, a new network of companies willing to work in accordance with those best practice conditions was created, to allow dialogue and sharing within the industry. Following the launch of the report Tourism Concern brought industry members and ethical volunteers together at a conference in October 2014.Jonathan Brown (October 24th 2014) The Independent In March 2014 at the House of Commons in London Tourism Concern launched a new research report on 'The Impacts of all- Inclusive Hotels on Working Conditions and Labour Rights'. This was commissioned by the IUF, which represents workers in the hotel industry. The report focused on hotel workers in Kenya (Mombasa), Tenerife and Barbados. A further piece of work, an online survey of consumer attitudes to all- inclusives, was completed in late 2014 and formed part of a developing strategy to engage more directly with tourists and travelers through the website. The survey report was published in January 2015.Tourism Concern,'The Perceived Impacts of All-inclusive Package Holidays on Host Destinations', January 2015 The huge growth in cruise tourism was also identified for research and campaign as far back as the mid 1990s. In the 2010s new research triggered a campaign to highlight the cruise industry's troublesome impacts on destinations and working conditions on board ships, accompanied by a briefing, 'Cruise Tourism - What's below the Surface?' published in March 2016. Recommendations for a code to help indigenous peoples engage successfully with tourism development were published in a briefing paper in 2017, and a campaign to implement its recommendations was still intended to be actioned at the time of closure. and at the end of that year a report raising disturbing issues and recommendations, 'Animals in Tourism', was launched at the House of Commons. This was the charity's final report.

After living a time in Monclova, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, working as postmaster,A. Ramos, Ra√∫l (2008). Beyond the Alamo: Forging Mexican Ethnicity in San Antonio, 1821-1861. The University of North Carolina Press. Page 101. he returned to San Antonio in the end of 1823, where he opened a store and participated in local political affairs. In July 1825, he was named secretary to political chief, keeping the charge until August 1827. In following year, in January 1828, and thanks to his influences (his friendship with prominent families), he was appointed acting governor of Coahuila and Texas as political chief of the Department of Texas, although he did not rule until 1830.  Career as gobernor of Coahuila and Texas  During this mandate, M√∫squiz lobbied to favour of the Anglo settlers of Texas, particularly on the issues of slavery, trade in contraband and Amerindian attacks. He also tried to mediate disputes taking place between the settlers and the national authorities, although he rejected the extralegal convention in San Felipe in October 1832 and he began to distrust the intentions of the Anglo-Americans. During the years of his mandate, in several of his letters to the viceroy of New Spain, he complained about the establishment of a foreign colony in Austin, because its inhabitants were speaking English, not Spanish, the official language of Texas. M√∫squiz resigned from office on 1831/July 7, 1834, citing health reasons. Even after leaving the office of political chief, M√∫squiz continued to participate in public affairs and he had a strong allegiance to Mexico. In 1835, he was appointment lieutenant governor of Agust√≠n Viesca. Moreover, it was after the jailed of Viesca, when, during the Texas Revolution, Ramon M√∫squiz was appointed governor of Texas in early 1835, in the presence of President General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. However, he never took office and in May that year, he submitted his resignation the office citing \\"family reasons\\". Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos reelected him as a political chief and, in December 1835, Cos appointed him to assist in the negotiations between the Mexican army and the Texans at the Siege of Bexar. M√∫squiz assisted in the identification of the bodies of the killed defenders of The Alamo. M√∫squiz knew the effects and consequences of New Spain government and its impact on Texas.  After his career as gobernor of Coahuila and Texas  In 1836, he moved with his family to the city of Monclova, in Coahuila, Mexico. where in addition to experience security of his nation, lived some of his relatives, including his sister Josefa M√∫squiz, who was the mother of the first medicine man of Monclova, Don Sim√≥n Blanco. M√∫squiz was known by people of Monclova for his experience in Texas government, so he was appointed political prefect - although as ad interim - in 1853 and 1858. In addition, he was one of the largest shareholders in terms of water rights, in the bags of water from San Francisco and San Miguel (now part of the Pueblo), to whose inhabitants he championed, with others people of Texas, for protect the guarantees of the state governments of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila to them, headed by former resident of Monclova Santiago Vidaurri Vald√©s. While he defended him, the government he represented required the delivery to ecclesiastical authorities of all the funds in support of the army to the north, where they fought many of the inhabitants of Monclova. Following this, in 1857, Father Jos√© Mar√≠a Villarreal Montemayor, claimed the water from the Confraternity of the Immaculate, property of the inhabitants of the village of San Francisco in Tlaxcala and, although they gave a large sum of money, he get the title of ownership. He refused to deliver the flow of the confraternity of the Virgin of Zapopan, that he previously divided among his family, so M√∫zquiz was forced to banish him, sending him into exile (he returned years later). M√∫squiz briefly returned to Texas in late 1850 to reclaim abandoned lands at its output. After evacuating French troops of Jeaningros in Monclova, he died on 27 November 1867.  Family  Don Ramon M√∫squiz married with Tejano Francisca Casta√±eda in San Antonio on December 16, 1823, and they had two sons in 1830: Francisca and Ram√≥n M√∫squiz Casta√±eda (the last of which followed the example of his father, occupying for long periods the Monclova political leadership and the mayoralty). A second son, Octaviano M√∫zquiz, served for a time as mayor of Monclova, and died in November 1871 in a shooting incident.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 9, 2011. The episode follows Peter, after he drinks kerosene, causing him to suffer from immediate kidney failure. In need of a replacement kidney, Peter is unable to locate a match, until it is discovered that his anthropomorphic dog Brian is a match, but would require the donation of both his kidneys. Meanwhile, Chris is instructed by his English teacher to write an essay about hope, in preparation of United States President Barack Obama's appearance at their school. Unable to write anything inspiring, he decides to pick his sister Meg's brain and use her ideas. The episode was written by Matt Harrigan and Dave Willis, and directed by Pete Michels. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.29 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Yvette Nicole Brown, Drew Carey, Gary Cole, Christine Lakin and Rachael MacFarlane, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"New Kidney in Town\\" was one of five episodes submitted for consideration for an Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" category in 2011. Plot Peter, Quagmire, and Joe are hanging out at the Drunken Clam. Peter is introduced to Red Bull by Quagmire at the bar. He ends up becoming highly addicted to it and it makes him operate at high speeds. Peter buys packs of Red Bull and introduces it to his family, though things get out of hand as soon as he starts performing everything too fast. One day, Peter comes home to find that Lois has dumped out the Red Bull in an attempt to make Peter give up his new addiction. This angers Peter, who in retaliation, attempts to make his own. Because of a misreading, Peter decides to put kerosene in his beverage believing that fuel causes the effect Red Bull caused him. Brian warns Peter that kerosene is dangerous, but Peter drinks the kerosene anyway. This causes him to collapse on the floor. The family learns that Peter has been diagnosed with kidney failure due to the damage done and he is in need of a transplant. However, since they must wait a few months before they can get donors, Peter must undergo dialysis at regular intervals. Three weeks later, after undergoing constant dialysis procedures, Peter gets angry that the dialysis treatments have stolen him from the world and becomes tired of it taking up his life. After being convinced by Joe and Quagmire that skipping one treatment wouldn't hurt him at all, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment but his assumptions are false and him skipping it causes him to become jaundiced and vomit blood. Back again at the hospital, the family learns that Peter's condition has a big chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option aside from the daily procedures is that one must give up one of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Dr. Hartman suggested one of the kids, but Lois refuses to put them through surgery because of their young ages. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover that he has the same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than a human's, the donation requires both kidneys, and so the procedure would kill Brian. However, Brian decides to go along with the procedure to save Peter's life. Unwilling to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there for the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie can live without a dog but not without a father. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman appears in a hospital gown, and reveals that he too is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died in vain. Thus, Brian's life is spared and Peter is saved. Meanwhile, at the same time during the kidney crisis, United States President Barack Obama has decided to visit Quahog, and Chris' entire English class is assigned to write an essay about hope. He consults his sister Meg for her opinion and she lists her personal opinion on the subject, which Chris plagiarizes. Meg is angry that he decided to take her words and call them his own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance. Production and development Dave Willis co-wrote the episode with Matt Harrigan. \\"New Kidney in Town\\" was co-written by Williams Street writers Dave Willis and Matt Harrigan, in their first official episode for the series. The two have also worked for Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, and Squidbillies, among others. The episode was directed by series regular Pete Michels, shortly after the conclusion of the eighth production season, in his first episode for the season. Series veterans Peter Shin and James Purdum, both of whom having previously served as animation directors, served as supervising directors for the episode, with Alex Carter, Andrew Goldberg, Elaine Ko, Spencer Porter and Aaron Blitzstein serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"New Kidney in Town\\". In addition to the regular cast, actress Yvette Nicole Brown, actor, comedian and game show host Drew Carey, actor Gary Cole, actress Christine Lakin and voice actress Rachael MacFarlane, sister of series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors John G. Brennan, actor Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith and writer John Viener made minor appearances in the episode. Cultural references Comedian and game show host Drew Carey appeared in the episode. In the opening scene of the episode, after complaining of being exhausted, Peter is introduced to the energy drink Red Bull by his friends, Quagmire and Joe. He then suddenly becomes extremely hyperactive, and begins singing the 1998 single \\"Ray of Light\\" by singer-songwriter Madonna in a parody of the high speed time-lapse of its video. Peter also goes on to appear on the American game show The Price Is Right, with actor and comedian Drew Carey appearing as host. He then begins playing the Showcase Showdown game, until the wheel suddenly spins off its axis and into the audience, running over several rows of people. After suffering from Red Bull withdrawal, Peter decides to create his own concoction, including kerosene. After drinking it, he suffers from immediate kidney failure, requiring constant dialysis. Deciding to go to The Drunken Clam with Quagmire and Joe, he is reluctant to go to his scheduled dialysis appointment, in order to watch the 1984 CBS series Charles in Charge. In preparation for a special appearance at their school, James Woods High School, Chris is assigned to write an essay about \\"hope\\" to welcome United States President Barack Obama. After reading his essay to the entire school, along with his sister, Meg, President Barack Obama, dressed similarly to Conrad Birdie as portrayed in the film version of the musical, begins singing and playing guitar in the school's auditorium. Obama then performs the song \\"Honestly Sincere\\" from the stage musical and film Bye Bye Birdie. Reception \\"New Kidney in Town\\" was broadcast on January 9, 2011, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons and the series premiere of the animated series Bob's Burgers, and followed by Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's spin-off, The Cleveland Show. It was watched by 9.29 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC, Undercover Boss on CBS and The Cape on NBC. The episode also acquired a 4.7 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating Bob's Burgers and The Cleveland Show in addition to significantly edging out the latter in total viewership. The episode's ratings increased significantly from the previous episode, largely due to the lead-in provided by the NFL Wild Card game that preceded the \\"Animation Domination\\" line-up. Television critics reacted mostly positive toward the episode, calling the storyline \\"heartfelt.\\" In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, \\"I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out and the whole thing revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions.\\" Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating \\"some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism.\\" He concluded his review by writing, \\"I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think it may have been a little bit too far to be truly great.\\" Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode \\"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\\" and The Simpsons episode \\"Moms I'd Like to Forget\\". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's \\"funniest moments,\\" which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode \\"taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family.\\" Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, \\"Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter‚Äôs dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change.\\" Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian. The episode was among four other episodes submitted by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category. \\"New Kidney in Town\\" was submitted, along with \\"Halloween on Spooner Street\\", \\"Road to the North Pole\\", \\"And I'm Joyce Kinney\\" and \\"Trading Places\\". The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, \\"We had internal discussions in the writers' room, and it seemed like we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. We assumed we would not get anywhere, and so it was a great surprise when we got the nomination.\\" References External links  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 9) episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Barack Obama Category:Red Bull ","title":"New Kidney in Town"},{"id":"29908870","text":"The Socialist National Defence Committee also known as the Socialist National Defence League was a pro First World War socialist faction.

Maresin 1, and more recently defined maresins, are 12-lipoxygenase-derived metabolites of the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), that possess potent anti-inflammatory, pro- resolving, protective, and pro-healing properties similar to a variety of other members of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) class of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites. SPM are dihydroxy, trihydroxy, and epoxy-hydroxy metabolites of long chain PUFA made by certain dioxygenase enzymes viz., cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases. In addition to the maresins, this class of mediators includes: the 15-lipoxygenase (i.e. ALOX15 and/or possibly ALOX15B)-derived Lipoxin A4 and B4 metabolites of the omega 6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid; the cyclooxygenase 2-derived Resolvin E series metabolites of the omega 3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid; certain 15-lipoxygenase-derived Resolvin D series metabolites of DHA; certain other 15-lipoxygenase-derived protectin D1 and related metabolites of DHA; and the more recently defined and therefore less fully studied 15-lipoxygenase-derived Resolvin Dn-3DPA metabolites of the omega-3 fatty acid n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (n-3 DPA or clupanodonic acid), the cyclooxygenase 2-derived Resolvin T metabolites of this clupanodonic acid, and the 15-lipoxygenase-derived products of the N-acetylated fatty acid amide of the DHA metabolite, docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (see resolvins).  Production  MaR1 was first defined as a product of DHA formed by cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages. Studies implicate the following pathway in its formation: 12-lipoxygenase converts DHA to its 14-hydroxperoxy intermediate, 14(S)-hydroperoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-DHA (14-HpDHA); 14-HpDHA is converted enzymatically to its 13(S),14(S) epoxy derivative, termed 13(S),14(S)-epoxy- maresin which is then enzymatically hydrolyzed to Mar1. Byproducts of this metabolism include the reduction of 14-HpDHA to its hydroxyl counterpart, 14(S)-hydroxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-DHA (14-HDPA); the 5-lipoxygenase- dependent conversion of 14-HpDHA and/or 14-HDHA to 7(S),14(S)-dihydroxy-4Z,8E,10Z,12E,15Z,19Z-DHA; and the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of 14-HpDHA to 7(S/R),14(S)-DHA and 13(S/R)-DHA products. Concurrently, the macrophages also convert DHA to 13(R),14(S)-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid, i.e. maresin 2 (MaR2). The measurement of 17-HDHA in tissues is used as a marker for the level of activation of the maresin-producing pathway.  Sources  The maresins have been detected primarily as products made by monocyte-macrophage cells types. MaR1 has been identified in the synovial fluid taken from the joins of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a murine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, MaR1 production was detected; its generation appeared to reflect an interaction between blood platelets and neutrophils wherein 12-lipoxygenase-rich platelets generated 13(S),14(S)-epoxy-maresin which was then passed to neutrophils which hydrolyzed the epoxy maresin to MaR1. Planaria worms metabolize DHA to Mar1 during the healing phase of experimentally induced tissue injury.  Activities  Studies suggest that maresins are involved in resolving inflammatory and allergic reactions, in wound healing, and in abating neuropathic pain. Mar1 enhances the uptake (i.e. stimulates the efferocytosis) of apoptotic human neutrophils by human macrophages, stimulates macrophage phagocytosis, and limits the infiltration of neutrophils into the inflamed peritoneum of mice. In a murine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, MaR1 generation was detected in a temporally regulated manner with early MaR1 production was dependent on platelet-neutrophil interactions; intravascular MaR1 was organ-protective, leading to decreased lung neutrophils, edema, tissue hypoxia, and prophlogistic mediators. In a murine model of a self-limiting pulmonary allergic reaction, MaR1 reduced lung inflammation. It appeared to act at least in part by augmenting the generation of regulatory T cells which interacted with Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (i.e. Helper T cell lymphocytes, see Innate lymphoid cell#GroupILC) to markedly suppress the production of two cytokines, Interleukin-5 and Interleukin-13, implicated in mediating allergic reactions. MaR1 accelerated tissue regeneration in experimentally injured planaria worms. In particular, it increasing the rate of head reappearance in beheaded worms. And, MaR1 reduced neuropathic pain in a mouse model by inhibiting a neuron ion channel, TRPV1, and thereby blocking capsaicin-induced inward currents and neuron excitation. Mar2 possess at least some of the activities ascribed to MaR1. It enhances human macrophage phagocytosis of particles and efferocytosis of apoptotic human neutrophils and reduces neutrophil infiltration into the inflamed peritoneum of mice. Its potencies ins producing these responses are similar to those of MaR1. 13(S),14(S)-epoxy-maresin inhibits the production of the arachidonic acid metabolite, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), by directly inactivating the enzyme, Leukotriene-A4 hydrolase, which converts the LTB4 precursor, Leukotriene A4, to LTB4; this effect may contribute to the resolution of inflammatory responses by reducing the production of the proinflammatory mediator, LTB4.  Clinical relevancy  Studies find that the maresins inhibit certain pro-inflammatory functions in human neutrophils and macrophages in vitro, that MaR1 and Mar2 reduce the entry of blood neutrophils into the inflamed peritoneum in a mouse model, and that Mar1 promotes the resolution of allergic pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model as well as wound healing in planaria worm model. These studies have not yet translated to human physiology or pathology. It is noted that MaR1 is detectable in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is also noted that macrophages derived by culturing the monocytes isolated from the blood of patients with Localized aggressive periodontitis have reduced levels of 12-lipoxygenase and MaR1 as well as reduced phagocytosis and killing of the periodontal pathogenic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; the latter functional defects were improved by treating the cells with MaR1. Further studies are needed to determine if maresins play a functional role in resolving inflammation, promoting wound healing, or limiting neuropathic pain and/or if maresins or their metabolism-resisent analogs are clinically useful in treating the latter conditions.

Dutch: Damse Vaart or Napoleonvaart) is a canal in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The canal links Bruges with the Western Scheldt at Sluis, Netherlands. It was constructed on the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte who wished to create a canal network in order to permit the efficient transport of troops without the risk of disruptive interventions from the British navy. Following the defeat of Napoleon, the original strategic imperative for the canal was removed. The plans in the Napoleonic era had called for a link to the Scheldt at Breskens. Half a century later the canal opened to traffic in 1856, and the link with the sea had moved to Sluis. At Damme the canal crosses the Leopold Canal and the Schipdonk Canal, both of which were dug in the middle years of the nineteenth century in order to reduce the vulnerability of the Belgian canal network to Dutch interference, after the achievement in 1830 of Belgian independence. It was necessary to create a system of Siphons because of the differences in water level of the three canals. The canal was used until 1940 when French troops destroyed the siphon system: this put an end to maritime transport on the Damme Canal. After World War II use of the canal resumed, but it was used now by pleasure boats, along with a tourist boat connecting Damme and Bruges.

Background The 95th Evacuation Hospital originally constituted as the 74th Surgical Hospital 21 December 1928. It was activated at Fort Warren, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 1 June 1941. The hospital was then reorganized and re-designated as the 95th Evacuation Hospital 14 August 1942. It was deactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, 3 December 1954. The 95th Evacuation Hospital was again activated on 26 March 1963 and deactivated in South Vietnam 28 March 1973. The 95th Evacuation Hospital was activated in Heidelberg, Germany for operation during the Gulf War 15 November 1994. World War II During World War II the 95th Evacuation Hospital operated as a 400-bed mobile hospital. The unit was staffed with approximately 40 doctors, 40 nurses, and 220 enlisted men. During operations in Morocco, Algiers, and Italy, it was attached to the U.S. Fifth Army and to the U.S. Seventh Army while operating in France and Germany. When the 95th Evacuation Hospital landed in Italy 9 September 1943, it was the first U.S. hospital established on the European continent in World War II. In addition to Salerno, the hospital made two other amphibious landings (Anzio and Southern France). The 95th Evacuation Hospital achieved national recognition at Anzio when, on 7 February 1944, a German plane dropped a load of fragmentation bombs on the hospital in an effort to evade two British planes, rendering the hospital inoperable, killing 28 people, and wounding an additional 60. Among the dead were two officers, three nurses, 16 enlisted men, a Red Cross worker, and two other personnel. As a result, the 95th was sent to the then-static Cassino front where it was re-staffed and re-equipped. Vietnam War As part of the buildup for operations in South Vietnam, the 95th was reactivated 26 March 1963 at Fort Benning, Georgia and alerted for overseas movement. The unit's advance team arrived at the proposed site of the hospital at Red Beach Base Area near Danang on 20 March 1968. By the time that the arrived with the unit's equipment and the majority of its personnel six days later, the members of this advance team had completed a design plan for the site and begun construction of an access road with assistance from the Seabees. The initial phase of construction included the preparation of defensive fortifications, perimeter wire and tentage for billets. During the initial phase the unit provided its own mess, electrical power, potable water and hospital laundry facilities. By 1 April, the vertical construction was initiated consisting of two-by-four frames for tent wards. Factored into the initial construction was the directive to ensure proper surgical conditions in the tropics for patients with traumatic injuries. There was some uncertainty. By conserving construction resources, the unit was able to construct a tropical structure suitable for air-conditioning. Despite supply shipping delays, construction of the first 100 beds was completed by 10 April. By 30 April, the hospital was 99 percent filled, and additional beds were rapidly being added. On 8 May, 300 beds were reported operational. May 27 saw a 400-bed hospital with a census of 240 and an experience of a total of 320 medical patients, 941 surgical patients and 1058 outpatients, with a total of 1261 admission and 1021 dispositions. Seven hundred and fifty-nine of these patients were not from transfer by direct admissions, and the facility was operating as a surgical as well as an evacuation hospital. Hospital personnel adapted, finding that the combined operation of a tent evacuation hospital and a Medical Unit, Self- contained, Transportable (MUST) operating room was feasible. During the following month the unit was continually harassed by Vietcong action in the nearby areas requiring the personnel to put in arduous 12-hour shifts of patient care and then sleep or stand watch on the perimeter during off-hours. By the end of June, the hospital had experienced an additional 1215 admissions and 1188 outpatients for a total of 2476 admissions in the first 63 days of operation. Not only was it necessary for the staff to build and run this tent hospital, they were also required to use their spare time to visit a new site under construction on My Khe Beach between Camp Tien Sha and Marble Mountain Air Facility. Offering advice, they helped plan the future move of their respective sections onto the new site (a move that was scheduled to start by 4 July). By the last week of June, Red Beach personnel were reduced to a minimum. The patient census was also reduced as low as the situation would allow. The actual move began with one third of the staff moving to the new site from 4-5 July. The remainder of the staff then moved approximately 60 patients. By the evening of 7 July, the hospital reported 323 beds operational. In a period of 71 days the personnel of the 95th Evacuation Hospital built one 400-bed ‚Äútent‚Äù hospital from the ground up on Red Beach, incorporating the use of parts of a MUST unit, operated it under combat conditions and moved completely to another location without interruption of its mission, and provided its own mess, electrical power, water supply and hospital laundry while doing so. The 95th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl) was a 320-bed air conditioned facility offering area medical support to U.S. Military units without organic medical support in the area around Da Nang, Vietnam. The hospital also provided medical care to the Free World Military Assistance Forces and civilian war casualties. The range of professional capabilities available (including four full-time dispensaries and Neurology, Dermatology, Special Radiologic Procedures, Oral Surgery, Psychiatric Consultations, Orthopedic Surgery, Neuro‚ÄîSurgery, General Surgery Services) made the 95th Evacuation Hospital a referral center for difficult and sophisticated cases in Northern Military Region I. Active ‚Äúon the job‚Äù training in all specialties of medicine was performed by medical corps officers and Vietnamese physicians as well. Medical, surgical and consultative assistance was provided to the Duy‚ÄîTon and Provincial Hospital of Da Nang on a regular basis. The hospital was used as the basis for the fictional 510th Evacuation Hospital in the American television series China Beach.

It was an independent research Institute of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) until 2012 when it was merged with the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics to a single unit entitled Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS). Member scientists of all its research groups have broad knowledge of Space Science and Earth observation techniques and their applications. They collaborate with other research groups in Europe and United States, and have been internationally recognized through editorship in scientific journals, invited talks at international conferences, invited review papers in top journals, high rate of citations and coordination of EU-funded research projects. History ISARS was founded in 1955, under the name Ionospheric Institute. In 1990, the Institute was renamed to Institute of Ionospheric and Space Research and in 1999 took its current title in order to reflect its expanded activities, which cover a variety of aspects of space research and applications. The location of the Institute until July 1995 was the historic site of the Hill of Nymphs near the Acropolis of Athens and the Theseion. The significant increase of staff members and R&D; projects made it necessary for the institute to move to new modern facilities at the NOA campus north of Athens, on Mount Penteli. In 2012 it was merged with the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics to a single unit entitled Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS), which is supervised and supported by the General Secretariat of Research and Technology of the Greek Ministry of Education. Facilities Hellenic GeoMagnetic Array The National Observatory of Athens operates ENIGMA (Hellenic GeoMagnetic Array), a ground-based magnetometer array in the area of south- eastern Europe (central and southern Greece) for space weather applications. The four existing stations are latitudinally equi-spaced between 30¬∞ and 33¬∞ corrected geomagnetic latitude and cover the areas of Thessaly, Central Greece and the Peloponnese. Each station is equipped with a state-of-the-art vector fluxgate magnetometer. In the near future another station will be installed in Macedonia or Thrace, and there are plans for the installation of an additional station in Crete by mid-2010. One of the primary research objectives assigned to ENIGMA is the study of geomagnetic field line resonances (FLRs). Ionospheric Station A fully automated ionospheric station operates at Penteli site since September 2000. Users can access real-time ionograms with the results of the automatic scaling, preview some recent ionograms and download daily SAO files using the SAO Data Base.

Goodyear was born in Birmingham in 1799. He was first apprenticed to an engraver on plate in that town named Tye. He also studied drawing under G. V. Burkes at Birmingham. He came to London, and was employed at first by Mr. Allen on engraving devices for shop bills and the like. In 1822 Goodyear placed himself under Charles Heath, the well-known engraver, for three years. Subsequently, he was extensively employed on the minute illustrations and vignettes which adorned the elegant 'Annuals' so much in vogue at that date. In 1830 he exhibited two engravings at the Suffolk Street Exhibition. He did not execute any large plate until he was employed by William and Edward Finden to engrave Eastlake's picture of 'The Greek Fugitives' for their Gallery of British Art.

Here, while still remaining involved in Scottish affairs, the Bissetts would establish themselves as the Lords of the Glens of Antrim and quickly become equally, then eventually more involved in the politics of the Irish province, becoming among the most Gaelicised of all the so-called Anglo-Norman families in Ireland. The heads of the leading branch of the family soon adopted the Gaelic lineage style Mac Eoin Bissett (of the Glens), by which they are known in the Irish annals, and which translates as \\"Son/Descendant of John Byset\\", after a prominent ancestor born in Scotland. In a number of English and Anglo- Norman sources the same head of the family is referred to as the Baron Bissett, also with variants. This family style or title eventually split, in a manner, to provide both the modern County Antrim surname Mac Eoin, anglicised McKeon/McKeown, and the surname Bissett itself (in Ireland), the latter not easily distinguishable from the typically Scottish Bisset, for which the doubling of the final -t-, the typical practice in Ireland from the 16th century, has become more common in modern times. In the Irish language Bissett is usually written Bised (Biseid). From Scotland to Ulster Precisely when John Byset arrived with his family from Scotland is unknown, but he appears in the (surviving) English documents relating to Ireland in 1245, when Henry III of England orders 50 marks to be given out of the treasury to him as a gift.Calendar of Documents, Relating to Ireland, 1171‚Äì1251, p. 418 Byset's activities from then on can only be guessed from the short description of his career in Ireland offered by the terse Annals of Ulster, reporting his death twelve years later in 1257. This entry at least proves that he had established himself prominently in the region with fire and sword: Murlough Bay, exemplary of the rugged coastal lordship of the Bissetts The Gaidhil in this context are the Gaelic Irish of Ulster and perhaps beyond. Whether he purchased his lands himself (one tradition) or was granted them by the English Crown (another) is also unknown, and his relationship with the leading English and other Scottish magnates of the region was probably complex. The first Earl of Ulster (1st creation), Hugh de Lacy, was dead by 1242/3 and his authority, namely the Earldom of Ulster, over the eastern quarter of the modern province of Ulster, this region being then called Ulidia, was incomplete. It is possible that the Bissetts aided de Lacy against his Scottish rival Donnchad, Earl of Carrick and received some of the latter's lands for their assistance,Duffy, passim but while attractive no account of such a thing is preserved. Following de Lacy's death, Brian Ua N√©ill rose to become the most powerful king in all the north of Ireland and in the 1250s was busy smashing the young earldom to pieces, killing many of the English (presumably Scots also) and destroying their castles,For example, Annals of Ulster 1253.4: A hosting by Brian Ua Neill that is by the arch-king of the North of Ireland, into Magh-Cobha, whereby the castle with its people and many other castles in Ulidia were destroyed and many persons were killed by him on that expedition. and the Bissetts may have been among the sufferers. However, the report of John Byset's death in 1257 shows that the family were viable and may have found themselves possibly even the most prominent British family remaining in Ulidia for a period, since no others are mentioned in the annals. O'Neill was elected High King of Ireland in 1258 by the O'Conors and O'Briens but his death only two years later in the Battle of Druim Dearg came too soon for a major Gaelic overlordship to be established and Walter de Burgh, the Lord of Connacht, was created Earl of Ulster four years after the conflict to preserve England's interests there. Possibly the Bissetts were forced to become his subordinates, but it has been argued that theirs was understood to be, in any case, a palatine lordship from its creation,H., \\"The Earldom and Barons of Ulster\\" whenever that may have been. Bruce Wars Rathlin Island from the Mull of Kintyre The historian Archie Duncan has suggested that Edward Bruce may have spent some time as a youth with the Bissetts,Duncan, p. 105 and it was to Rathlin Castle that Robert the Bruce and his followers retired in 1305/6 after suffering losses in Scotland. Despite the decrees of Edward I of England, they were reportedly welcomed by the owner Sir Hugh Byset, usually presumed to be a son of the Mac Eoin, and at this time Rathlin Island belonged to the Lordship of the Glens. It was also here that Robert Bruce may have begun planning to re-conquer Scotland, and later Sir Hugh's manor of Glenarm is where his brother Edward arrived after their victory in the Battle of Bannockburn.The Description and Present State of Ulster, p. 155, note (Hore) Parliament sent summonses to a total of five Byset magnates when hearing news of the invasion, their names being John, Hubert, William, and two named Hugh, one presumably Sir Hugh Byset, and the John Byset possibly being the Mac Eoin gone into rebellion to fight on the side of the Scots (for whom see below). The 19th century scholar Herbert Hore suggested the Bysets may actually have inspired Edward Bruce to later invade Ireland. Since no pedigree of the Irish Bissetts survives, precise relationships can only be guessed and the politics in and of the lordship are unclear. However, Hugh Byset was among the most prominent magnates in the greater region because Aonghus √ìg of Islay mentions him in a 1301 letter to Edward I as his compatriot, the pair \\"awaiting the royal commands.\\"MacDonald, p. 90 MacDonald's personal loyalty in practice to the English king is uncertain, perhaps complicating the matter, but Byset's is much more clearly established, because he is recorded a number of times, from the late 1290s, in the Anglo-Norman documents, being commanded to fight against the English king's enemies in Scotland, most notably Robert Bruce, the treasury (Crown) paying Byset's expenses for mustering his forces and equipping fleets to go against the Scots, and also sending supplies.Calendar of Documents, Relating to Ireland, 1293‚Äì1301, pp. 265, 284; Calendar of Documents, Relating to Ireland, 1302‚Äì1307, pp. 171‚Äì2, 183 When Edward Bruce invaded Ireland in 1315, Hugh Byset and the heads of several other families, Norman and Gaelic, joined Sir Thomas de Mandeville in opposing him. In fact where Bruce landed, Olderfleet Castle, was quite possibly owned by the Bissett family, but no account is preserved of what if anything this may, if true, have had to do with strategic decisions made by either side. In any event, their mixed Norman-Irish force, importantly lacking the immediate support of the otherwise occupied Earl of Ulster, Richard √ìg de Burgh (who was mustering an army from his domains in Connacht), was defeated by one led by Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, and the Scottish army then proceeded south to Carrickfergus. The engagement is recalled by John Barbour, who greatly exaggerates the size of the Irish army to be defeated, in his famous epic poem The Brus:Barbour, The Brus, ed. Skeat, Vol. II, p. 3, Book XIV, lines 44‚Äì51. Minor translations by Wikipedia contributor. A drawing of Carrickfergus Castle, built in 1177 by John de Courcy There were, however, members of the family on both sides. A Johannes Bisset, who may very well have been the Mac Eoin gone to Scotland in rebellion and now returning,Hore, \\"The Bruces in Ireland\\", p. 4 is listed in Pembridge's Annals and Grace's Annals, both Latin compilations, as one of the eight Scottish lords accompanying Bruce in the invasion of Ulster. According to these Johannes/John Bisset was a leader in the force defeating de Mandeville and his kinsman Hugh Byset, Logan and the Savages above, was evidently with the Scots when later opposed by the armies of Richard √ìg de Burgh and Edmund Butler, and was still with Bruce when victorious against Roger Mortimer in the Battle of Kells.Annales Hibernie ab anno Christi 1162 usque ad annum 1370 (Pembridge's Annals), M1315.3, p. 344; Annales Hiberniae (Grace's Annals), pp. 62 + note, 63 ff. Bisset then appears to have died in February the next year (1316),Annales Hiberniae (Grace's Annals), pp. 68‚Äì9 the cause and exact date now unknown. Hugh Byset was still active fighting for the other side. On All Saints' Day (1 November, the Irish Samhain) in 1316 John Logan and he inflicted a defeat on an army of Scots, killing one hundred in heavy armour and two hundred in regular.Annales Hiberniae (Grace's Annals), pp. 76‚Äì7 In The Brus, John Barbour reports the Bissetts, presumably led by Sir Hugh, again with de Mandeville, Logan, the Savages, altogether with the de Clares, FitzGeralds, Butlers and others, in an alliance defeated by Bruce's army,Barbour, The Brus, ed. Skeat, Vol. II, pp. 21‚Äì3, Book XIV but the account is confused, location unspecified, and receives no support from the annals and other reliable sources, making it unlikely to have occurred as reported by the poet if such an encounter took place at all. Despite his support of the English Crown Hugh Byset's lands, Glenarm and Rathlin Island, were declared forfeit by the same government. Why is uncertain, but a (perhaps confused) report made to Edward II in September 1315 that \\"Bisset-men and Logans\\" had aided Bruce's arrival may have contributed, as might any report of his earlier welcome of Robert Bruce to Rathlin, and the role in the conflict of Sir Hugh's relation John. Whether anything was carried out is unknown, and in any event the collapse of the Earldom of Ulster less than two decades later in 1333 was the beginning of the end of direct English authority in the region for a long period, leaving the Bissetts surrounded by several increasingly influential Gaelic powers. But five years later in 1338 the situation remained uncertain, and to Byset's aid came his powerful friend John of Islay, the Lord of the Isles, who in May of that year petitioned Edward III to restore to Byset certain lands in \\"Glynarvie\\" which had come into the king's possession from the forfeiture of Richard de Mandeville, with Edward III agreeing to grant them to Byset, taking into account either his or John of Islay's previous service in driving out the Crown's enemies (the language of the document leaving it unclear which).Calendar of the Patent Rolls 1338‚Äì1340, p. 82 Notably John of Islay describes Sir Hugh as his kinsman, as he also may be described less than two weeks later at the beginning of June, when the Crown grants a certain \\"John Byset of Rachryn\\" protection out of regard for his kinsman the Lord of the Isles.Calendar of the Patent Rolls 1338‚Äì1340, p. 88 Mac Eoin and the O'Neills The first certain contact of the Bissetts with the O'Neill dynasty is recorded in 1287, when Richard √ìg de Burgh involved the short-lived Earldom of Ulster, to which the Bissetts still belonged at this time, in an O'Neill succession dispute. But since this is also the earliest known occurrence of the Gaelic lineage or princely style Mac Eoin, only a few decades after the arrival of the family in Ulster, the Bissetts have already culturally assimilated to a notable degree: There are no surviving mentions of the Mac Eoin Bissetts in the Irish sources for nearly another century. The Earldom of Ulster, already weakened by the Bruce invasion, collapsed following the assassination of William Donn de Burgh in 1333. It is unknown what role the Bissetts might have played in this, but half a century later in 1383 they are found probably allied with the O'Neills against the remnants of the earldom, which were led by the Savage family.Nicholls, p. 388 In that year Niall M√≥r √ì N√©ill, King of Ulster launched a massive assault against the remaining English in the north of Ireland, burning their towns and laying waste their territories, and following one engagement Seinicin Finn Bissett, a son of the Mac Eoin, is found dispatching the wounded Raibilin Savage, opponent of Aodh √ìg √ì N√©ill in the battle. Bissett is himself slain by Savage's people in revenge for this.Annals of Ulster 1383.7; Annals of the Four Masters 1383.3 That the Bissetts were now formally allied to the O'Neills may be supported by several notices in 1387 of the death of one Sabia O'Neill (Sadhbh inghen Aodha U√≠ N√©ill), wife of the Mac Eoin Bissett, in which she is praised as \\"the choice woman of the descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages in her time\\" and \\"a lady that far surpassed all the ladies of the Clanna Neill, in all good parts requisite for the character of a noble matron\\".Annals of the Four Masters 1387.2; Annals of Clonmacnoise 1387 (see also Hill, An Historical Account, p. 22); Annals of Ulster 1387.3 All entries describe her as the daughter of one Aodh √ì N√©ill but who this might be is uncertain. The 19th century genealogist John O'Hart preserved the tradition that Aodh Reamhar √ì N√©ill, King of Ulster and King of Tyrone (died 1364), also called Aodh M√≥r, and the father Niall M√≥r above, also had four daughters but does not give their names nor whom they married.O'Hart, p. 718 Further evidence of Bissett support for the Ulster Gaels against the English has possibly been found. A certain \\"MacGion\\" reported on the Gaelic side in a conflict in 1403 is suggested by the historian Kenneth Nicholls to be \\"none other than [the] Mac Eoin Bisset\\". Englyshe rebelles The following belongs to a section of the preliminary list created in 1515, before the Tudor conquest of Ireland, for Henry VIII of England of the leading families of Ireland, both of Gaelic and other lineage, who were not under English control. These were the strongest families of whom his officials had knowledge. First the Gaelic families are listed, and then the Norman families who have gone Gaelic:State Papers, Henry the Eighth, Vol. II, pp. 6, 7 Early 16th century Ulster Later on in the same document Ulster is discussed again. This time there are four Anglo-Norman families mentioned:State Papers, Henry the Eighth, Vol. II, p. 27 A similar list, of contemporary or slightly later date, made itself into the circa 1540 compilation known as the Book of Howth. The editors of the manuscript note that the list is in a different hand from the surrounding text:The Book of Howth (printed in the Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts), p. 256 The reference in both to Captains is very important. This was the English term for those families who enjoyed effectively total sovereignty within their territories, even if these might not be extensive. In describing the Gaelic Captains in the beginning of the first document, the officials report that \\"... some callyth themselffes Kynges, some Kynges Peyres, in their langage, some Prynceis (Flatha), some Dukes, some Archedukes... and obeyeth to no other temperall person... and hath imperiall jurysdyction in his rome [realm]...\\"State Papers, Henry the Eighth, Vol. II, p. 1 Gaelic Ireland is described as a patchwork of various overkingdoms, petty kingdoms, and other territories with limited to no national overlordship, although some might be practised at the provincial level, for example by the O'Neills in the case of Ulster. The Bissetts and these other \\"English\\" families were those who had become like the Gaelic Irish, adopting their concepts of sovereignty, manners and styles. This was sometimes referred to as becoming more Irish than the Irish themselves, although the extent of Gaelicization varied by family. Some families were later brought back, and others not. We never get to find out in the case of the Bissetts because they have apparently gone under by the time the Kingdom of Ireland is proclaimed and Henry begins receiving the submission of the princes. Lordship lost The Battle of Knockavoe in 1522 as described in the Annals of Connacht: Glenariff, the 'Queen of the Glens' Above is the final report of an activity of the Mac Eoin Bissett family in the Irish and English sources, and it is assumed that not long after, the MacDonnells, newly of Antrim and the former friends and allies of the Bissetts, somehow managed to dispossess them of the Lordship of the Glens.History of Glenarm Castle, Estate of Glenarm Castle Only ten years previously the Bissett lordship was weakened by the invasion of Gerald M√≥r FitzGerald into the region, who after entering the O'Neill Clandeboye lordship and taking the castle of Belfast marched through into Bissett territory, where he destroyed the Mac Eoin's castle and plundered much of the Glens and surrounding countryside.Annals of Ulster 1512.2; Annals of the Four Masters 1512.11 This misfortune was itself preceded by another, although not of the same magnitude, in 1495, when the O'Donnells of Tyrconnell to the west, the leading rivals of the O'Neills, made a small stealthy raid on the Mac Eoin's personal estates, and according to the Annals of the Four Masters succeeded in capturing him, his praiseworthy wife, steeds and hound, who were all considered to be the finest in the area, as well as an amount of his personal fortune. This not always completely reliable compilation, being the work of biased Tyrconnell scholars, claims this was caused by the Mac Eoin's refusal to give up his fine steed to Conn O'Donnell after it has been requested.Annals of the Four Masters 1495.19 The actual extent of the damage is uncertain and the event is reported in no other source. In the annals it is clear that FitzGerald's invasion seventeen years later involved far greater forces. Margery Byset and the MacDonnells The MacDonnell claim to the Glens of Antrim dated from the marriage of Margery Byset, a daughter of the Mac Eoin, to John M√≥r MacDonnell, the second son of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, in the 1390s. From the date of this marriage, or soon after, he and their descendants, the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, considered the Lordship of the Glens to be theirs and styled themselves lords of \\"Dunnyveg and the Glens\\", first found being styled so in a document dating to 1403.Nicholls, pp. 387‚Äì8 However the male line of the Bissetts was certainly \\"far from extinct,\\" and whatever gains made by the MacDonnells are uncertain. Bissett hostility to the MacDonnells may in fact have produced an alliance between the latter and the Savage family, and the war-making, on the side of the Ulster Gaels, against the English of Ulster, including the Savages, by a certain MacGion, likely the Mac Eoin Bissett, in 1403 may be associated with MacDonnell's new style as recognised by Henry IV. Also notable is that a member of the Savage family, the seneschal of Ulster Richard Savage, had the wardship of Margery, as well as her sister Elizabeth, following the late Mac Eoin's death, and this included some control over whatever for certain their actual inheritances may have been,The Description and Present State of Ulster, p. 156, note (Hore) but it is unknown what exactly this may have had to do with the marriage to MacDonnell or if any possible alliance may have been influential. Elizabeth I, by Steven van der Meulen, c. 1563 In the opinion of W. F. T. Butler the MacDonnell claim was of doubtful legality,Butler, p. 18 while according to George Hill they did not establish a permanent (or any) presence in the Glens until Alexander Carragh in the early 16th century, who is noticed campaigning in the Irish annals in the 1520s.Hill 1859, pp. 248 ff. He was a strong leader with a large following,Hill 1859, p. 249 and it is in this decade the Bissetts appear to lose control of their lordship following the Battle of Knockavoe. One of Alexander Carragh's sons, the celebrated Sorley Boy, was finally allowed by Elizabeth I in 1560 to be a tenant of the lands he claimed \\"by inheritance,\\" but the MacDonnells continued to struggle to gain a foothold because of Ulster's leading prince, Shane O'Neill, who continually harassed them. In 1573, six years after O'Neill's death, Sorley Boy (re-)petitioned, and this time for \\"a portion of the Glynns claimed by him by inheritance from the M[B]issetts\\", with the government thinking it a good idea to grant because they could use him against the Irish who were still refusing to submit.Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts 1515‚Äì1574, p. 449; Calendar of the State Papers relating to Ireland 1509‚Äì1573, p. 526 However, he himself soon became involved in a major conflict with the English, and ended up settling in The Route, the old MacQuillan lordship to the west of the Glens, while a younger brother, Donnell Gorme MacDonnell, swore fealty to Elizabeth in 1584 for \\"so much of the Glynns in Ulster as were the lands of Myssett, otherwise Bissett\\", agreeing to pay what yearly rents the Lord Deputy Henry Sidney decided, this being 60 beeves (cattle).Calendar of the State Papers relating to Ireland 1574‚Äì1585, p. 534; Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts 1575‚Äì1588, p. 381 Uncertain is the actual extent of the territory being granted at this moment and the size of the lordship certainly varied over time. But less than two years later, and shortly before Elizabeth and James VI of Scotland agreed in the 1586 Treaty of Berwick that the MacDonnells would finally have the right to stay in Ireland, the Lord Deputy granted the lordship, the yearly rents again being 60 beeves, to Angus MacDonnell of Dunnyveg, another relative of Sorley Boy, with all its castles and \\"Myssett alias Byssett's lands\\" save Olderfleet Castle (by this time of uncertain origin to the parties involved), this to become the property of the Queen.Calendar of the State Papers relating to Ireland 1586‚Äì1588, pp. 58‚Äì60, 110; Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts 1575‚Äì1588, p. 426 1586 description This same year Sir Henry Bagenal, in his Description and Present State of Ulster, describes the Glynns as they were understood then as being:The Description and Present State of Ulster, p. 155 The Glynns contain seven baronies, these being Larn, Park, Glenarm (the seat of the lordship), Redbaye, Lade, Cary, and Mowbray, with Rathlin Island counted as an additional half barony, and they were understood to be:The Description and Present State of Ulster, pp. 155‚Äì6 Uncertain is whether Irish and English attempts to drive out the MacDonnells in the 16th century are meant, or if their \\"quiet possession\\" of the territory refers to the period of over a century before this when the lordship or most of it remained in the possession of the Bissett family. Alternative view In the minority is the scholar Simon Kingston, who has recently argued, using an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence approach, that the MacDonnells did in fact gain the upper hand to become dominant in the Glens following the marriage of Margery Byset to John M√≥r MacDonnell. His approach disregards the lack of a MacDonnell presence in the Irish sources and English ones covering Irish affairs in favour of assuming the accuracy of the MacDonnell claims and styles prior to the 1520s.Kingston, Ulster and the Isles, passim What is unknown is whether the Bissetts ever recognised the nominal overlordship of the much more powerful Scottish dynasty still based in the Western Isles, a different species of submission from giving up their lordship itself. If so then the MacDonnell claims could be understood differently, but remain unverifiable. Kenneth Nicholls finds Bissett acceptance of the MacDonnell intrusion unlikely and military retaliation probable. Glenarm Castle, near the site of the old Bissett manor of Glenarm Earldom of Antrim The MacDonnells were still pressing their claim based on their \\"inheritance\\" and descent from Margery and the Baron (Mac Eoin) Bissett into the 17th century. After Randal MacDonnell, a son of Sorley Boy, received a grant for both the Glynns and the Route in 1603, he was created Viscount Dunluce in 1618 and soon after that 1st Earl of Antrim in 1620. In the 11th year of Elizabeth's reign an Act of Parliament officially vested the \\"Baron Bissett's land\\" in the Crown of England, and in 1617‚Äì8 the MacDonnells' claim to it as \\"heirs unto Bissett\\" remained of importance,Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts 1603‚Äì1624, p. 354 with the new Viscount Dunluce's pedigree even provided for the record:Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts 1603‚Äì1624, p. 375 Domhnall Ballach, the son of John M√≥r and Margery, spent some time under the protection of the O'Neills in Ireland after fleeing Scotland following conflicts with James I, but he returned to his seat on Islay in 1437 and is not recorded in possession of any part of the Glens from that time or at his death in 1476 in contemporary Irish or English sources. His son John Mor (II) MacDonnell (executed 1499), the 3rd Lord of Dunnyveg, also lived his life in Scotland, but his son was the Alexander Carragh already discussed, evidently responsible for completely ousting the Bissetts in the Glens in the 1520s or not long after. Descendants The Earldom of Antrim, although much reduced, still exists today and in the possession of descendants, the Earls of Antrim and Viscounts Dunluce, of the Lady Margery and the Mac Eoin Bissetts. Their Gaelic title has also been revived in a fashion recently by another MacDonnell descendant, who styles himself MacDonnell of the Glens and received recognition from the Irish government (until courtesy recognition of Chiefs of the Name was ceased in 2003).Ellis, p. 251; Curley, p. 66 A certain ghost by the name of Ann Bissett was in the 19th century and may still be known to inhabit Glenarm Castle and its grounds, where she will not appear to MacDonnells, only to others, because of the bitter later history of their families.A., \\"Glenarm Castle and its Ghost\\" A Greek family? While a pedigree of the Irish Bissetts probably does not survive, Duald Mac Firbis, in his Leabhar na nGenealach, tells us in his pedigree of the MacDonnells the following:Translated by Reeves, p. 388. Original page number varies by manuscript. The passage goes on to state incorrectly that the MacDonnells had by 1649 been in possession of the Glens of Antrim for 227 years, but above we are provided with our only surviving mention of what was a tradition current in Ireland some period of time before the mid-17th century. Duald Mac Firbis reported pedigrees and traditions as he found them and so it is not his own speculation. Without offering an opinion on this claim of Greek origins, John O'Donovan wondered if this should really mean (to Scotland with) William the Lion,Annals of the Four Masters, Vol. VI, p. 1894, note it being the well known case that the Scottish king brought a number of Norman families with him to Scotland, from 1174, following his captivity in England. In fact the first known Byset in Scotland, Henricus Byset, witnessed a charter by William circa 1198.James Cairney (1989), Clans and Families of Ireland and Scotland, p. 143 But this is not of the most importance, as the family are typically classed as Norman in any case, even if their origins beyond that grouping are uncertain.

Goold was born of a wealthy Protestant family in Cork. Coming to Dublin about 1789 he proceeded to squander his patrimony, some 10,000l, in rioting and entertainments, at which Grattan, Saurin, Bushe, Plunkett, and others, are said to have been present. Having come to the end of his resources, he applied himself zealously to practice at the bar, to which he had been called in 1791.

In 1799 Goold wrote an ‚ÄòAddress to the People of Ireland on the subject of the projected Union,‚Äô and sat in the last session of the Irish parliament as a member of the opposition. In 1818 he gave evidence at the bar of the House of Commons upon the inquiry into the conduct of Windham Quin. Meanwhile his practice had been rapidly increasing. In 1824 W. H.

Stephens studied law at North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London), graduating in 1978. After further study in Brussels he was admitted as a solicitor in 1982. Stephens started his career as a lawyer providing advice to artists and soon established his own practice with a partner. In 1987 Stephens helped defend the American artist J. S. G. Boggs from a counterfeiting charge. He gained a reputation as \\"the patron solicitor of previously lost causes\\" following this case and others where he defended artists' freedom of expression, as well as representing the leaders of the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì85 and James Hewitt when allegations of his affair with Diana, Princess of Wales first emerged. During the 1990s Stephens worked on cases arising from the occupation of the Brent Spar oil platform. He also provided advice to the \\"McLibel two\\", activists who were being sued by McDonald's. In 1999, his law firm merged with Finers to form Finers Stephens Innocent, with Stephens becoming the head of the international and media department, a position he continues to hold today. During the next decade he was involved in several cases defending the publishers of online material (both old and new media firms) against charges of libel brought against them. The Times in 2008, described him as both a \\"passionate supporter of human rights\\" and \\"one of the best advocates for freedom of expression\\". In 2010, he represented Julian Assange, the founder of the whistleblower website, WikiLeaks, defending him against extradition to Sweden. Stephens has sat on many charitable, regulatory, government and academic committees including those related to contemporary art, education, media law, libel law and human rights. He was appointed UK chair of trustees for the international media charity Internews in 2018. The University of East London (previously North East London Polytechnic) awarded him an honorary doctorate in law in 2001. In 2009, Stephens was appointed the Chairman of the Governors at that university. He has also assisted politicians in their drafting of legislation, in the UK in the 1990s regarding the regulation of the press and in Romania in 2005 regarding freedom of information laws. Stephens frequently appears in the UK media. In the 1990s he was a legal correspondent for Sky TV and he has featured regularly in both print and on television during his career. He has also contributed to two legal books and is on the editorial board of three legal journals. Personal life and education Stephens was born in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on 7 April 1957 to \\"very, very poor\\" parents. His father was an artist and his mother a secretary and later a social worker. As a boy he was \\"quite sporty\\" and swam for his county. He attended St Paul's Secondary Modern School and Strode's Grammar School, followed by the Cambridge Manor Academy for Dramatic Arts, before going on to study law at North East London Polytechnic. He says that he was partly \\"tricked\\" into studying law by his father. He graduated in 1978 and then went on to study European Community Law at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels and was then admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court in England and Wales in July 1982. He married Donna Coote in 1982 and they have three daughters. In the 1990s, he taught scuba diving, a hobby he began in his teens, and built up a collection of art and sculptures. Legal career 1982‚Äì1992 Stephens is licensed to practise before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and has made several legal interventions in the European Court of Human Rights. Stephens began his career as a volunteer lawyer at ArtLaw, the first legal advice centre for artists, having been interested from an early age as his father was an artist. In 1982 he became the legal director of ArtLaw, a position he held until 1984. In 1983, with Roslyn Innocent, he established Stephens Innocent as a law firm to specialise in visual arts and intellectual property. In 1987, Stephens met Geoffrey Robertson, who along with Sir Keir Starmer, Lord John Hendy he admires as \\"creative lawyers\\", and the pair went on to successfully represent Bob Monkhouse who had been \\"charged with defrauding film distributors in relation to a film and television archive\\". In the same year, he defended the American artist J. S. G. Boggs who had been arraigned before The Old Bailey on charges under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 in relation to his painted and drawn artworks which mimicked and adapted bank note designs. According to an article in the Law Gazette in 1992, the case was influential in launching his career. He realised that the case against Boggs was strong, so decided to make the Bank of England \\"look as stupid as possible\\" using the media as a tool, and in the end successfully defended the artist. Following this case he represented several other artists and art dealers in cases over freedom of expression, including an art gallery that was displaying earrings made by Rick Gibson from human foetuses. He also advised Robert Mapplethorpe on displaying his images in the UK. In February 1991, Stephens was acting as a solicitor for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), when John Hendy, Geoffrey Robertson and two other QCs defended Arthur Scargill and Peter Heathfield against claims that they had handled funds inappropriately during the miner's strike of 1984‚Äì85. In 1992 he worked on a case brought by the NUM against the government which saw an earlier decision to close 31 coal mines, overturned after it was deemed unlawful. Stephens has used his knowledge of the media in favour of his clients. When allegations of an affair between James Hewitt and Diana, Princess of Wales were published by The Sun in 1992, Stephens put out a wire through the Press Association stating that he had issued proceedings against the newspaper for defamation and libel. As he explained to the Law Gazette in 2005, he had issued but not actually served the writ, but the statement had the effect that other newspapers did not follow up on the story in detail. Instead, the direction of the story changed, and the next day the papers wrote about whether or not Princess Diana would be likely to appear at a libel trial. At one point he had to go into hiding in the south of France along with Hewitt to avoid the media who were chasing them. Princess Diana later admitted the affair on television, which he admitted was \\"a bit embarrassing\\". It was after these cases that the Law Gazette described him as \\"the patron solicitor of previously lost causes\\", a label which has stuck with him throughout his career. In his 2009 book on international libel and privacy, Charles Glasser wrote that \\"it is this reputation for creativity with law that leads international publishers and broadcasters to his door\\". At the time the label was given to him, Stephens disagreed, stating they were not lost causes: \\"I usually win\\". Other cases he took on in 1992 involved representing the families of victims of the Lockerbie bombing, and British soldiers killed in a friendly fire incident during the first Gulf War. 1993‚Äì1999 In 1993 Stephens helped the MP Clive Soley to draft a parliamentary bill on press regulation. Stephens commented that people thrust into the public light needed protection from the press, but that \\"astronomical\\" fines would be needed to be able to achieve this. According to The Guardian his public profile was further raised by defending Greenpeace in 1995, against litigation brought by Shell over an alleged illegal occupation of the Brent Spar oil platform. Throughout the 1990s Stephens, together with barrister Keir Starmer QC, undertook a series of legal challenges on behalf of Quaker, mid-wife and peace activist, Lindis Percy. Percy, committed to non-violence, researched ancient rights of way across US spy bases and nuclear facilities, then enforced her ancient right to roam. Stephens and Starmer provided pro bono assistance throughout the McDonald's Restaurants v Morris & Steel case to two activists, Helen Steel and David Morris, the so-called \\"McLibel Two\\". The defendants had handed out leaflets entitled \\"What's wrong with McDonald's?\\" in 1985 and were subsequently tried for libel. The case began in 1990 and became the longest running court case in UK history. After the defendants were fined ¬£60,000 he took their case to the ECHR in 2004, where they successfully appealed against the fine. As Stephens explained to The Guardian in 2004, a key part of their defence was that the original trial was not fair as the pair did not have legal aid and so \\"they were unable to get witnesses and scientific expertise\\" to help defend them. Discussing the case with The Lawyer he said he believed that, \\"British justice failed dismally here\\" in that the way the pair were left defending themselves for so long. A documentary, McLibel was made by Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach about the case, with footage shot in Strasbourg at the European Court of Human Rights. In 1994 Stephens represented the defendant in R v Carol Peters (the appeal and re-trial) in which the Court of Appeal quashed Peters' murder conviction (alleged tamazepan poisoning and the inflicting of 39 stab wounds to her husband) ordering a re-trial at which she was acquitted of murder, the jury accepting that she was suffering from battered women syndrome, an evolving area of law at the time. Stephens had instructed the former Solicitor General for England and Wales, Vera Baird QC in the case. In 1998, Stephens was invited to give the Tom Sargant Memorial Lecture. These lectures, delivered by leading legal figures, began in 1989 a year after the death of the lawyer Thomas Sargant. In 1999, Stephens began to act as a mediator with ADR Chambers. He continues to mediate disputes today. In the same year, The Lawyer reported speculation as to whether Stephens would leave Stephens Innocent to join another law firm. In December 1999, it was announced that Stephens Innocent would merge with Finers, a firm specialising in property and commercial law, to form Finers Stephens Innocent. Stephens became the head of the international and media department. In 2009, Stephens described the firm to The Times as being a \\"niche within a niche\\". 2003‚Äì2009 In 2000, in the Independent Schools Tribunal, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice, he successfully defended A. S. Neills Summerhill School, a private free school. The proceedings were brought by OFSTED on behalf of then Education Minister David Blunkett who was seeking the closure of the school. The case was later dramatised by Tiger Aspect Productions in a TV series entitled, \\"Summerhill\\" and broadcast on BBC Four and CBBC. In August Stephens was retained by heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson for a hearing before the British Boxing Board of Control. The disciplinary hearing related to 2 counts relating to Tyson's behaviour after his 38-second victory over Lou Savarese in Glasgow in June that year, Tyson escaped a ban from fighting in Britain. Stephens successfully deployed a defence of freedom of expression for Tyson, the first use before the BBBofC but Tyson was convicted on the other count and fined. In 2002, Stephens defended the Dow Jones in Dow Jones & Co. Inc. v Gutnick, a case where Joseph Gutnick, an Australian mining magnate, sued the Dow Jones after an article critical of him was published on the website of the Barron's newspaper. Gutnick successfully applied to the Australian High Court, requesting for the case to be heard in Australia, rather than the United States, where the First Amendment protects free speech. The case was highly controversial and the subject of much commentary from legal analysts. Stephens himself described the ruling as a \\"very worrying decision\\" as it potentially opened the door for libel cases related to internet publishing to be heard in any country and in multiple countries for the same article. The case was appealed by the author William Alpert to the UN under the right of direct petition for individuals. As a consequence the case name was changed to Alpert v Australia. In the teeth of that application, the case was settled on 15 November 2004 by Dow Jones, who agreed to pay Gutnick some of his legal fees. In January and December 2002 Stephens was retained by the Washington Post to represent its veteran war correspondent, Jonathan Randal, in the Hague at the United Nations Court, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia establishing the principle of qualified privilege for the protection of journalists in war crimes courts. Of all his cases, Stephens is most proud of his defence of Randal, as he feels it is important that journalists are protected. In 2003 Stephens was asked to advise on a libel tourism case in which Khalid bin Mahfouz and two members of his family sued for libel in London Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, an Israeli-born writer and United States citizen, over her book on terrorist financing, Funding Evil.Britain, a destination for \\"libel tourism\\" In 2005, he was asked to draft new legislation regarding freedom of information by Romania that was compliant with NATO and EU law. In 2006, along with Geoffrey Robertson, he successfully defended the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe. The case centred on an article published in the WSJ in 2002, which alleged that the United States were monitoring the bank accounts of a Saudi Arabian businessman to ensure he was not funding terrorists. Jameel, who was represented by Carter Ruck, was originally awarded ¬£40,000 in damages but this was overturned in favour of the WSJ. The case was viewed by The Lawyer as a landmark case which redefined the earlier case of Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd, upholding the right to publish if it is deemed to be in the public interest. In late 2006, Stephens represented Russia, Oleg Mitvol and RosPrirodNadzor (Russian Federal Service for the Oversight of Natural Resources) in an environmental case to prevent the despoiling of the Russian far east by Royal Dutch Shell. The case was ultimately settled with Shell giving up many of its rights and paying compensation. In early 2007, instructed by aboriginal lawyer Michael Mansell, Stephens launched proceedings for the Tasmanian Aborigines to recover 15 sets of their stolen ancestral remains, then residing in the bowels of the Natural History Museum in London. He accused the museum of wishing to retain them for, \\"genetic prospecting\\". Later in 2007, he defended the parenting website Mumsnet pro bono against a libel claim by Gina Ford, a baby expert. Several users of the site had criticised Ford's techniques; there were other postings she said were \\"vile and disgusting\\". Stephens said it was troubling that the website could be held liable for the postings of its users and that people should be able to \\"give their own views and reasonable readers can make up their own minds\\". The case was settled out of court, after Mumsnet apologised to Ford and paid some of her legal costs. Stephens has since cited the case as an example of how the law is unable to cope with the digital age, having been created by people \\"who are not part of the messenger generation\\" and that it therefore needs revising. Also in 2007, Stephens was instructed to represent cricket umpire Darrell Hair in relation to ICC proceedings arising from the ball tampering incident involving Pakistan in August 2006 at the oval in the summer of 2006 In 2008, he won an apology from a former police driver who had written \\"appalling lies\\" about the novelist and essayist Sir Salman Rushdie in a book he wrote. One allegation was that Rushdie had profited from the fatwa issued against him after publishing The Satanic Verses. 2010 onwards January 2010 brought the first ‚Äì known colloquially as the alphabet soup case ‚Äì in the (then) new UK Supreme Court, Stephens represented several media organisations to argue that the names of several people who were accused of funding terrorist organisations should have their anonymity stripped. The judges agreed with the media and ruled that the names should be released, noting that anonymity orders had become \\"deeply ingrained\\" in court cases in the UK. After the ruling Stephens commented, \\"No court henceforth should grant an anonymity order in a significant case unless it is satisfied that the litigant, if identified, would be in serious danger of physical attack.\\" Towards the end of 2010, Stephens was invited by the Jamaican Government to review that country's libel laws and appear before a Parliamentary select committee. Shortly after his return Stephens began to defend the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, against extradition to Sweden, where allegations had been made against Assange. Soon after the WikiLeaks cables disclosure began, Stephens told The Guardian that he thought he was being monitored by the security services and that his home was being watched. In January 2011, Stephens claimed that United States authorities were trying to develop a criminal case against Assange, citing, for example, a subpoena against Twitter issued by the United States Department of Justice to demand private information on Assange and other people associated with WikiLeaks. The Guardian reported that Assange ended his relationship with Stephens after he accused Finers Stephens Innocent of withholding a ¬£412,000 advance for his autobiography to cover legal fees. Assange accused them of \\"extreme overcharging\\" which Finers Stephens Innocent denied. The firm took sued Assange in January 2012 to recover fees. Following the court proceedings he paid the bill. Stephens has been invited to make a number of interventions in the European Court of Human Rights in free speech cases. Sanoma v Netherlands, MGN v United Kingdom, Mosley v United Kingdom, and Haldimann v Switzerland. In July 2011, it was reported that Stephens had been one of a group of high-profile lawyers who may have been the victim of the News International phone hacking scandal. In May 2012, Stephens gave a lecture and wrote an article in The Guardian calling for the International Olympic Committee to ban countries where homosexuality is illegal from competing in the Olympic Games. He also urged any athletes that felt they would be unsafe in their home countries due to their sexuality to claim asylum in the UK. His remarks were embraced by the gay-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell and several human rights organisations stated that the IOC should speak out, even if a ban was unrealistic. Reception His public clashes have resulted in some counterstrokes. A week after a radio debate with a former editor of The News of the World the paper published an \\"'axe murderer' type photo\\" of him, related to a case he was working on. He laconically commented that, \\"If you don't like it, you should go and do some residential conveyancing or something\\". On his CV he also notes how he was once \\"rendered into a Spitting Image puppet\\". In 2001, a website operated by an anti- feminist, angryharry.com created a section dedicated to vilifying Stephens. He told the Law Gazette that the site did not bother him and that he had added a link to his CV. Commenting to The Times in 2009 on the perceived glamour of being a media solicitor, he said that this is incorrect: \\"It's not glamorous, not a good work-life balance and you need to be available 24/7\\", but he added that \\"the work can be very stimulating\\". He was described in The Times 2008 Law100 list as \\"Mr 'Media Lawyer' himself\\", as a \\"passionate supporter of human rights\\" and \\"one of the best advocates for freedom of expression\\". Appointments Stephens exercising his right as a Freeman of the City of London, by driving a sheep over London Bridge in 2009 Stephens has held many charitable, regulatory, government and academic appointments. He is also a Freeman of the City of London. In 1986 he was appointed the treasurer of the North East London Law Society and in 1989 was elected to the committee ultimately becoming President. He was on ICSTIS' (a premium telephone line regulator) emergency committee, but resigned in 1996, after it emerged he had not disclosed a possible conflict of interest. Later that year, Stephens was appointed the first Chair of the Policy board of the Internet Watch Foundation and became the vice-chairman on the merger of the Policy and Management Boards. He is currently a trustee of Index on Censorship, Chair of the International Advisory Board of the Media Legal Defence Initiative, the postgraduate course in comparative media law and social policy at Oxford University, the Solicitors Pro bono Group (now, LawWorks), and the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute and Media Law Committee. Stephens sits on the Advisory Boards of Oxford University's Programme in Comparative Media Law & Social Policy, at Wolfson College, Oxford, the University of Hong Kong Media Law Course and Indiana University's Center for International Media Law and Policy Studies. On 1 April 2006 Stephens was appointed to be a trustee of the International Law Book Facility, a charitable organisation whose objects are to donate lawbooks to improve access to legal information/access to justice where there is a need. From 2003-07, Stephens was a member of the board of governors of Rose Bruford College of Theatre & Performance. In August 2009 he was appointed Chairman of the Governors at the University of East London and in October 2010 as Chair of the Contemporary Art Society. He was appointed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to be a member of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Free Expression Advisory Board; in January 2010, he was appointed to a working group on libel laws, set up by the then Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, which published a report in March 2010. Stephens is currently serving on the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth Lawyers Association and was elected President of its Council at the Cape Town Conference in April 2013. In January 2011 Stephens was asked to Judge the documentary Current Affairs ‚Äì International category 2009/2010 and was invited back in January 2012 to judge the same category for the Royal Television Society. In October 2011, Mark Stephens was appointed as the new Chair of the Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS). Mark was instrumental in the establishment of DACS in 1984 ‚Äì law firm Stephens Innocent was a home to DACS in the first years after its establishment.

Mar√≠a Cristina Bridge (, ) is a bridge over the Urumea river passing through the Basque city of San Sebasti√°n (Spain). Construction and opening In 1893 was built a temporary wooden walkway that would allow direct access from downtown to the North Station, the bullfighting arena or the velodrome. On day 19, before the opening of the new bridge, the suspension was driving on the old wooden bridge, for its subsequent destruction. The final bridge was inaugurated on January 20, 1905, festivity of Saint Sebastian. Mar√≠a Cristina Bridge in 1893. Welcome to Spanish Royalty, January 20, 1905. The invitation stated: \\"Tengo el honor de invitar a V... al solemne acto de la inauguraci√≥n del Puente de Mar√≠a Cristina que se celebrar√° el d√≠a 20 del corriente, a las 3 de la tarde y al t√© que a continuaci√≥nde la indicada ceremonia tendr√° lugar en la Casa Consistorial. San Sebasti√°n, 15 de Enero de 1905. El Alcalde Presidente del Excelent√≠simo Ayuntamiento. De levita o uniforme.\\" The Caja de Ahorros of the municipality had funded the construction of the bridge with a credit to one hundred years without interest. Ribera and Zapata had been the authors of the project and Marcelo Sarasola and Jos√© de Goicoa, engineer and municipal architect, respectively. On the bridge highlighted the four monumental obelisks, located at its ends, copies of the Alexander III bridge in Paris, of 18 metres of high, crowned by sculptural groups. It was built on reinforced concrete, which was a novelty for that time, with three arches of 24 metres of long, with 20 metres of wide and 88 of long. The opening was cause of a great celebration. At 3 o'clock in the evening began with the performing of the music band La Uni√≥n. After played the music bands of two infantry companies. Then entered the band of the city council with the corporation, press, etc.., Which came from the Pescader√≠a Street and during all the tour were decked balconies. In case of bad weather was expected to make a special trip by tram. In the nearby streets had large audience. And a ringing of bells announced the arrival of the religious authority. Later the Orfe√≥n Donostiarra and the Choir of the Municipal Academy of Music of San Sebasti√°n consisted of 110 children, sang a hymn composed for the occasion by the master Santesteban. At half past six p.m. almost whole the neighborhood had gathered near of North Station to witness the fireworks and the toro de fuego scheduled. San Sebasti√°n had three years without festivities as protest for the ban of the Sokamuturras feasts by the City council, for consider that this celebration \\"was more own of a small town than a large capital\\" so that on January 14, 1902, had ignited outrage among the young people that had shown their anger stoning lampposts, shop windows, and official centers and newsrooms. So this day was taken police actions to avoid disturbances. Along the bull were about ten serenos with prepared sticks and to a few metres walked many others serenos, prompting loud protests of the neighborhood. And so ended this opening day.

Lympha represents a \\"functional focus\\" of fresh water, according to Michael Lipka's conceptual approach to Roman deity,Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 67. or more generally moisture.Patricia A. Johnston, \\"The Mystery Cults and Vergil's Georgics,\\" in Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia (University of Texas Press, 2009), p. 268; Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar (Routledge, 2005), p. 137. Vitruvius preserves some of her associations in the section of his work On Architecture in which he describes how the design of a temple building (aedes) should reflect the nature of the deity to be housed therein: > The character of the Corinthian order seems more appropriate to Venus, > Flora, Proserpina, and the Nymphs [Lymphae] of the Fountains; because its > slenderness, elegance and richness, and its ornamental leaves surmounted by > volutes, seem to bear an analogy to their dispositions.Vitruvius, De > architectura 1.1.5, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius of the translation > by Joseph Gwilt, The Architecture of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (London, 1826). > The Latin text at LacusCurtius is that of Valentin Rose's 1899 Teubner > edition: Veneri Florae Proserpinae Fonti Lumphis corinthio genere > constitutae aptas videbuntur habere proprietates, quod his diis propter > teneritatem graciliora et florida foliisque et volutis ornata opera facta > augere videbuntur iustum decorem. A textual crux occurs at the relevant > phrase: Gwilt translates Fontium Lumphis (\\"for the Lymphae of the > Fountains\\"), but some editions give Fonti Lumphis (\\"for Fons, for the > Lymphae\\"). The name Lympha is equivalent to, but not entirely interchangeable with nympha, \\"nymph.\\" One dedication for restoring the water supply was made nymphis lymphisque augustis, \\"for the nymphs and august lymphae,\\" distinguishing the twoCIL 5.3106; Ballentine, \\"Some Phases,\\" p. 95; Theodor Bergk, \\"Kritische bemerkungen zu den r√∂mische tragikern,\\" Philologus 33 (1874), p. 269. as does a passage from Augustine of Hippo.Augustine of Hippo, De civitate Dei 4.34: the ancient Jews, he says, \\"did not worship Nymphs and Lymphs when the rock was smitten and poured forth water for the thirsty\\" (nec quando sitientibus aquam percussa petra profudit, Nymphas Lymphasque coluerunt, English translation by R.W. Dyson). In poetic usage, lymphae as a common noun, plural or less often singular, can mean a source of fresh water, or simply \\"water\\"; compare her frequent companion Fons, whose name is a word for \\"fountain,\\" but who is also invoked as a deity. When she appears in a list of proper names for deities, Lympha is seen as an object of religious reverence embodying the divine aspect of water. Like several other nature deities who appear in both the singular and the plural (such as Faunus/fauni), she has both a unified and a multiple aspect.Lipka, Roman Gods, p. 67; Joshua Whatmough, The Foundations of Roman Italy (1937), p. 159. The simultaneous oneness and multiplicity of these deities is an example of monotheistic tendencies in ancient religion: \\"Lower gods were executors or manifestations of the divine will rather than independent principles of reality. Whether they are called gods, demons, angels, or numina, these immortal beings are emanations of the One\\": Michele Renee Salzman, \\"Religious koine in Private Cult and Ritual: Shared Religious Traditions in Roman Religion in the First Half of the Fourth Century CE,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 113. The nymphs, with whom the lymphae are identified, are among the beings who inhabit forests, woodlands, and groves (silvas, nemora, lucos) and ponds, water sources and streams (lacus, fontes ac fluvios), according to Martianus Capella (2.167), who lists these beings as pans, fauns, fontes, satyrs, silvani, nymphs, fatui and fatuae (or fautuae), and the mysterious Fanae, from which the fanum (sacred precinct or shrine) is supposed to get its name. She was the appropriate deity to pray to for maintaining the water supply, in the way that Liber provided wine or Ceres bread.Ballentine, \\"Some Phases,\\" p. 91, citing Augustine, De civitate Dei 4.22, 34; 6.1. Name and functions The origin of the word lympha is obscure. It may originally have been lumpa or limpa, related to the adjective limpidus meaning \\"clear, transparent\\" especially applied to liquids.Entries on limpidus and lympha, Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), pp. 1031 and 1055; Arthur Sidgwick, P.vergili Maronis Aeneidos Liber VII (Cambridge University Press Archive, n.d.), p. 61, note 377; Fernando Navarro Antol√≠n, Lygdamus. Corpus Tibullianum III. 1‚Äì6: Lygdami elegiarum liber (Brill, 1996), pp. 418‚Äì419. In his Etymologies (20.3.4), Isidore of Seville says that \\"limpid (limpidus) wine, that is, clear, is so called from its resemblance to water, as if it were lymphidum, because lympha is water\\"; translation by Stephen A. Barney et al., The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 398. An intermediate form lumpha is also found.CIL 1.1238, as cited by Bergk, \\"Kritische bemerkungen zu den r√∂mische tragikern,\\" p. 269. Bergk demonstrated that lympha was in origin Italic, and not a borrowed Greek term, despite the spelling. The spelling seems to have been influenced by the Greek word ŒΩœçŒºœÜŒ± nympha, as the upsilon (Œ•,œÖ) and phi (Œ¶,œÜ) are normally transcribed into Latin as u or y and ph or f.Bergk, \\"Kritische bemerkungen zu den r√∂mische tragikern,\\" pp. 264‚Äì269. That Lympha is an Italic conceptJacqueline Champeaux, \\"Sorts et divination inspir√©e. Pour une pr√©histoire des oracles italiques,\\" M√©langes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome 102.2 (1990), p. 827. is indicated by the Oscan cognate diumpƒÅ- (recorded in the dative plural, diumpa√≠s, \\"for the lymphae\\"), with a characteristic alternation of d for l.Whatmough, Foundations of Roman Italy, p. 383; R.S. Conway, The Italic Dialects (Cambridge University Press, 1897), p. 676; Johnston, Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia, p. 268; Bergk, \\"Kritische bemerkungen,\\" p. 265. These goddesses appear on the Tabula Agnonensis as one of 17 Samnite deities, who include the equivalents of Flora, Proserpina, and possibly Venus (all categorized with the Lymphae by Vitruvius), as well as several of the gods on Varro's list of the 12 agricultural deities. On the Oscan tablet, they appear in a group of deities who provide moisture for crops.Johnston, Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia, pp. 268‚Äì269. In the Etruscan- based cosmological schema of Martianus Capella, the Lymphae are placed in the second of 16 celestial regions, with Jupiter, Quirinus, Mars (these three constituting the Archaic Triad), the Military Lar, Juno, Fons, and the obscure Italo-Etruscan Novensiles.Martianus Capella, The Marriage of Philology and Mercury 1.46 online. A 1st-century A.D. dedication was made to the Lymphae jointly with Diana.CIL 9.4644 = ILS 3857. The Italic lymphae were connected with healing cults. Juturna, who is usually called a \\"nymph,\\" is identified by Varro as Lympha: \\"Juturna is the Lympha who aids: therefore many ailing people on account of her name customarily seek out this water\\", with a play on the name Iu-turna and the verb iuvare, \\"to help, aid.\\"Varro, De lingua latina 5.71: (Lympha Iuturna quae iuvaret: itaque multi aegroti propter id nomen hanc aquam petere solent). See also Frontinus, On Aqueducts 1.4, where Juturna is in company with the Camenae and Apollo. C. Bennett Pascal, The Cults of Cisalpine Gaul (Latomus, 1964), p. 93, reads an inscription as linking the Celtic god Belenus (usually identified with Apollo) and the Lymphae, but Dessau reads Nymphae (ILS 4867). Servius, note to Aeneid 12.139, has Juturna as a fons, and Propertius 4.21.26, as the lympha salubris who restored a horse of Pollux (some editions emend to nympha; see note to the line at Sexti Aurelii Propertii Elegiarum Libri Quattuor, edited by N. Lemaire (1840), p. 448 online). Juturna's water shrine was a spring-fed lacus in the forum which attracted cure-seekers, and Propertius connected its potency to Lake Albano and Lake Nemi, where the famous sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis was located.Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 74, 105, 152, 228, 230‚Äì231. Juturna's cult, which Servius identifies as a fons, was maintained to ensure the water supply, and she was the mother of the deity Fons.Servius, note to Aeneid 12.139: \\"Juturna is a fountain (fons) in Italy. ‚Ä¶ It was customary to offer sacrifices to this fountain in respect to a scarcity of water,\\" as cited and discussed by Ballentine, \\"Some Phases,\\" pp. 91‚Äì93. The temple was vowed by G. Lutatius Catulus as the result of a naval battle during the First Punic War. Arnobius, Adversus Nationes 3.29, identifies her as the mother of Fons. In Cisalpine Gaul, an inscription links the Lymphae to the Vires, \\"(Physical) Powers, Vigor\\", personified as a set of masculine divinities,CIL 5.5648; Joseph Clyde Murley, The Cults of Cisalpine Gaul as Seen in the Inscriptions (Banta, 1922), pp. 32‚Äì33. a connection that in his monumental work Zeus Arthur Bernard Cook located in the flowing or liquid aspect of the Lymphae as it relates to the production of seminal fluid.Arthur Bernard Cook, Zeus (Cambridge University Press Archive), p. 306. As a complement to the Vires, the Lymphae and the nymphs with whom they became so closely identified embody the urge to procreate, and thus these kinds of water deities are also associated with marriage and childbirth.R.B. Onians, The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p. 220; Ballentine, \\"Some Phases of the Cult of the Nymphs,\\" p. 97ff; on marriage (mainly in regard to nymphs, but see note 216), Salvatore Settis, \\"'Esedra' e 'ninfeo' nella terminologia architettonica del mondo romano,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt (1973), pp. 685‚Äì688. When Propertius alludes to the story of how Tiresias spied the virgin goddess Pallas Athena bathing, he plays on the sexual properties of lympha in advising against theophanies obtained against the will of the gods: \\"May the gods grant you other fountains (fontes): this liquid (lympha) flows for girls only, this pathless trickle of a secret threshold.\\"Propertius, Elegies 4.9.59‚Äì60, as cited and discussed by Tara S. Welch, \\"Masculinity and Monuments in Propertius 4.9,\\" American Journal of Philology 125 (2004), p. 81. The Augustan poets frequently play with the ambiguous dual meaning of lympha as both \\"water source\\" and \\"nymph\\". In the poetry of Horace,Ballentine, \\"Some Phases,\\" p. 94. lymphae work,Horace, Carmen 2.3.11‚Äì12 (laborat). dance,Carmen 3.13.13‚Äì16 (desiliunt) and Epode 16.47‚Äì48 (desilit). and make noise;Epode 2.27 (obstrepunt). they are talkative,Carmen 3.13.13‚Äì16(loquaces). and when they're angry they cause drought until their rites are observed.Sermo 1.5.96‚Äì103 (iratis). Some textual editors have responded to this personification by emending manuscript readings of lymphae to nymphae. When the first letter of a form of -ympha is obliterated or indistinct in an inscription, the word is usually taken as nympha instead of the less common lympha.Bergk, \\"Kritische bemerkungen zu den r√∂mische tragikern,\\" pp. 268‚Äì269; Wilhelm Adolf Boguslaw Hertzberg, note to Propertius 3.16, Sex. Aurelii Propertii Elegiarum Libri Quattuor (1845), p. 340. Divine madness Roman mosaic depicting the abduction of Hylas by the nymphs In the religions of ancient Greece, Rome, and the Celtic territories,Ausonius, Ordo urbium nobilium 20.29‚Äì34, mentioning Divona; entry on \\"Spring deities\\" in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, edited by John Koch (ABC-Clio, 2006), pp. 1623‚Äì1624. water goddesses are commonly sources of inspiration or divine revelation, which may have the appearance of madness or frenzy. In Greek, \\"nympholepsy\\" (\\"seizure by the nymphs\\") was primarily \\"a heightening of awareness and elevated verbal skills\\" resulting from the influence of the nymphs on an individual.Jennifer Lynn Larson, Greek Nymphs: Myth, Cult, Lore (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 13. The term also meant a physical snatching or abduction of a person by the nymphs, as in the myth of Hylas, and by extension became a euphemism or metaphor for death, as evidenced by both Greek and Roman epitaphs.Larson, Greek Nymphs, pp. 13‚Äì14, 70. A person who was a religious devotee of the nymphs might also be called a \\"nympholept.\\"Larson, Greek Nymphs, p. 14. The Latin verb lympho, lymphare meant \\"to drive crazy\\" or \\"to be in a state of frenzy,\\" with the adjectives lymphaticus and lymphatus meaning \\"frenzied, deranged\\" and the abstract noun lymphatio referring to the state itself. Vergil uses the adjective lymphata only once,Gertrude Hirst, \\"An Attempt to Date the Composition of Aeneid VII,\\" Classical Quarterly 10 (1916), p. 93. in the Aeneid to describe the madness of Amata, wife of Latinus, goaded by the Fury Allecto and raving contrary to mos, socially sanctioned behavior.Vergil, Aeneid 7.377, as noted by Sidgwick, p. 61, and R.D. Williams, The Aeneid of Vergil: Books 7‚Äì12 (St. Martins Press, 1973, 1977), pp. 195‚Äì196, who observes that it is \\"a very strong word.\\" See also Debra Hershkowitz, The Madness of Epic: Reading Insanity from Homer to Statius (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 50. Among the Greeks, the Cult of the Nymphs was a part of ecstatic Orphic or Dionysiac religion. The adjective lymphatus was \\"strongly evocative of Bacchic frenzy,\\"As at Pacuvius. Trag. 422f.; Catullus 64.254, the Ariadne epyllion; and Lucan, Bellum Civile 1.496, as noted by Paul Roche, Lucan: De Bello Civili, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 309. and the Roman playwright Pacuvius (220‚Äì130 BC) explicitly connects it to sacra Bacchi, \\"rites of Bacchus.\\"Pacuvius as quoted by Varro, De lingua latina 7.5. See also Johnston, Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia, p. 268. In 186 BC, during the lifetime of Pacuvius, the Roman senate placed severe legal restrictions on the Bacchanalia, the Dionysian rites celebrated in Italy. R.B. Onians explained the \\"fluidity\\" of the ecstatic gods in the context of ancient theories about the relation of body and mind, with dryness a quality of rationality and liquid productive of emotion. Water as a locus of divine, even frenzied inspiration links the Lymphae to the Latin Camenae, who became identified with the Muses.R.B. Onians, The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate (Cambridge University Press, 1951), pp. 34‚Äì35, 67. In his entry on Lymphae, the lexicographer Festus notes that the Greek word nympha had influenced the Latin name, and elaborates: > Popular belief has it that whoever see a certain vision in a fountain, that > is, an apparition of a nymph, will go quite mad. These people the Greeks > call numphol√™ptoi [\\"Nymph-possessed\\"] and the Romans, lymphatici.Translation > from Larson, Greek Nymphs, pp. 62‚Äì63. Festus states that the Lymphae are > \\"called that after the nymphs,\\" then explains: Vulgo autem memoriae proditum > est, quicumque speciem quandam e fonte, id est effigiem nymphae, viderint, > furendi non feciesse finem; quos Graeci ŒΩœÖŒºœÜŒøŒªŒÆœÄœÑŒøœÖœÇ vocant. Latini > lymphaticos appellant (p. 107, Teubner 1997 edition of Lindsay). Because the states of madness, possession, and illness were not always strictly distinguished in antiquity, \\"nympholepsy\\" became a morbid or undesirable condition.Larson, Greek Nymphs, p. 62. Isidore compares Greek hydrophobia, which literally means \\"fear of water,\\" and says that \\"lymphaticus is the word for one who contracts a disease from water, making him run about hither and thither, or from the disease gotten from a flow of water.\\" In poetic usage, he adds, the lymphatici are madmen.Isidore, Etymologies 4.6.12 and 10.L.161, as translated by Barney et al., pp. 110, 223. See also Festus, entry on Lymphae, p. 107 in the edition of Lindsay. During the Christianization of the Empire in late antiquity, the positive effects of possession by a nymph were erased, and nymphs were syncretized with fallen angels and dangerous figures such as the Lamia and Gello. Tertullian amplifies from a Christian perspective anxieties that unclean spirits might lurk in various water sources, noting that men whom waters (aquae) have killed or driven to madness or a terrified state are called \\"nymph-caught (nympholeptos) or lymphatic or hydrophobic.\\"Tertullian, \\"On Baptism\\" 2.5. translated by S. Thelwall: \\"Are there not other cases, too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning? Witness all shady founts (fontes), and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds in the baths and the conduits in private houses, the cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of 'spiriting away' through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned or affected with madness or with fear, they call nymph- caught (nympholeptos), or 'lymphatic,' or 'hydrophobic' (an non et alias sine ullo sacramento immundi spiritus aquis incubant adfectantes illam in primordio divini spiritus gestationem? sciunt opaci quique fontes et avii quique rivi, et in balneis piscinae et euripi in domibus vel cisternae, et putei qui rapere dicuntur, scilicet per vim spiritus nocentis. nam et esetos et lymphaticos et hydrophobas vocant quos aquae necaverunt aut amentia vel formidine exercuerunt).

Located at 617 South Jefferson Street at the southern end of Downtown, the Patrick Henry was designed by William Lee Stoddart and opened in 1925. The building now serves as apartments, office space, and a restaurant in the former lobby rebranded simply The Patrick Henry. It is located in the Roanoke Downtown Historic District. History In the years following World War I, Roanoke continued to develop as a boomtown due to the growth of the Norfolk and Western Railway, and as such, the city needed additional lodging options for persons traveling to the city. In 1923, local business leader William Wise Boxley chartered The Hotel Corporation to serve as the developer of the Patrick Henry. Later in the year, Boxley selected William Lee Stoddart as the project architect with James Stewart & Company of New York selected as the general contractor. With overall construction costs rising, in 1924, Boxley chartered the New Hotel Corporation to raise additional capital needed to complete the hotel. Taking its name from the American Founding Father Patrick Henry, the 300-room hotel celebrated its grand opening the following year on November 10, 1925, with over 2,000 people in attendance. The Patrick Henry name was actually chosen in a naming contest, and the winner was a young Roanoker, John Payne, who went on to become a Hollywood star in the 1940s, appearing in Miracle on 32nd Street, among others. At the time of its opening, the Patrick Henry was operated by the hotel management firm of Meyer Hotels of Birmingham, Alabama; Meyer operated the hotel through 1954. In the interim, the hotel received its first major renovation in 1938 under the design of local architects Edward G. Frye and Frank F. Stone. A local management company operated the hotel for a few years, and in 1961 the American Hotel Corporation took control when the Patrick Henry was auctioned off to pay off ownerships debts; American Hotel ran the hotel until 1968. It was at this time the Monterey Corporation of Parkersburg, West Virginia, renovated the original 300 rooms into 121 hotel and apartment units. The building was operated as both apartments and a hotel though the 1980s. In 1990 Affirmative Equities of New York purchased the hotel and spent $3 million to renovate the structure and rebrand it under the Radisson name. After several attempts to foreclose on the property, by the late 1990s, Affirmative Equities was considering options on converting the hotel into senior living units. Attempts co convert the hotel into senior living units failed in both 2002 and again in 2004. With the final resident having moved out by 2005, the hotel closed its doors in 2007 and the structure was subsequently condemned as it was non-compliant with fire code. After being foreclosed on in 2009 for failing to pay back taxes, the property was purchased by Potomac Realty Capital of Boston for $2 million and subsequently resold to Roanoke developer Ed Walker the following October. Its transformation into apartments began in late 2009. In December 2010. the Jefferson College of Health Sciences announced they would reserve 56 of the units for use by their students. The $20 million renovation was completed in June 2011 and includes 134 apartment units, a restaurant, and retail/office space.

He was the son of Max Kaufmann (died 1902), a businessman, and Friederike Baumwald (Kaufmann) (born 1862). Kaufmann is best known for his studies of neo-classicism. Career From 1913 he studied at both the University of Innsbruck and the University of Vienna. In Vienna he studied under Max Dvo≈ô√°k, Josef Strzygowski and Moriz Dreger in the spirit of the so-called Vienna School of Art History, such as Alois Riegl and Franz Wickhoff, who attempted to give greater objectivity to the study of art. Kaufmann fought as a soldier in World War I and afterwards attended to his studies intermittently because of illness. He received his Ph.D. in 1920, writing his dissertation under Dvo≈ô√°k on the development of the architecture of Ledoux and classicism.Panayotis Tournikiotis, \\"The Historiography of Modern Architecture\\", MIT Press, 1999, 274. . After completing his studies, Kaufmann was unable to obtain an academic position and so earned a living as a bank clerk. In 1933, Kaufmann published the book \\"Von Ledoux bis Le Corbusier\\", which argued for a formal aesthetic continuity between neoclassicism and modernism. It was regarded by established Austrian scholars such as Hans Sedlmayr as symptomatic of all that was bad about Modernism. After the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by the Nazi's, Kaufmann, being a Jew, managed to emigrate to the US, where he taught art history at various universities. In 1952 he published the book \\"Three Revolutionary Architects: Boull√©e, Ledoux, Lequeu\\". He died in Wyoming in 1953 while travelling to Los Angeles before his magnum opus, \\"Architecture in the Age of Reason\\", could be completed. The work was published posthumously in 1955. His style of writing and scholarship is termed formalism, derived to an extent from the philosopher Immanuel Kant's notion of autonomy in art, from his work Critique of Judgement, in Kant's own words, art is \\"a mode of representation which is purposive for itself and which although devoid of a purpose, has the effect of advancing the culture of the mental powers in the interests of communication.\\"Immanuel Kant, Critique of Judgement, Translated by James Creed Meredith, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007 (original publication date 1952), para. 44306. .

Founded by artists and curators Michael Keene, Frank Shifreen, and George Moore, the shows featured monumental sculpture parks next to the Gowanus Canal. The two major shows attracted thousands of visitors during their brief runs in 1981 and 1982. The participants artists such as Carl Andre, Andy Warhol-sponsored Keith Haring, Christo, Linda and Terry Jamison, Vito Acconci, Nancy Holt, John Fekner, the controversial Chris Burden, sculptor Jim Nickel, and Fred Wilson. Group founding In 1979 Frank Shifreen, a recent art graduate of Pratt Institute, began hosting open-studio party art shows at his Brooklyn, New York studio apartment. There a variety of local New York artists began to network. His building, which was a nineteenth-century munitions factory at 230 3rd Street in Gowanus, Brooklyn, had over 9,500 square feet, much of it un-rented. Shifreen asked his landlord to periodically use the un-rented space. The building was right next to the extremely polluted Gowanus Canal, was also just two blocks from a five-acre abandoned dump that had been classified as a city- owned \\"Public Site\\". At Smith Street and 5th Street, it was filled with weeds, trash middens, and expired auto bodies. The Monumental Show (1981) Shifreen teamed up with artists Michael Keene and George Moore to plan an art exhibition using both the empty space in the munitions factory and the public space next door. They enlisted help from the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation and Carroll Gardens Association, also receiving a $1500 grant from the Brooklyn Council on the Arts. Calling themselves the Gowanus Canal Memorial Artyard, they began wheatposting posters throughout the city six months before the show, calling it The Monumental Show. The black- and-white posters were a call for entries, and they received thousands of proposals for live rock music performance and art installations. The organizers selected 150 artists who were each given a 20 by 20 foot space to create their art. The theme of the exhibition was monumental art, which consisted of paintings, sculptures, mixed media, and anything one-and-a-half times normal size. The participants included new talent, as well as established artists such as Carl Andre and Andy Warhol-sponsored Keith Haring. Reception The show opened on May 16, 1981, and more than 4000 people visited just that first weekend to see the art and hear live music. As a result of the show, Shifreen's landlord had him arrested for allegedly stealing electricity, and the ensuing controversy increased the press the show was already receiving. On June 8, 1981, New York Magazine did an article on the show entitled \\"Gowanus Guerrillas\\", calling it \\"the event of the season.\\" On June 15, 1981, the show made the cover of the New York Daily News. Controversy One artist, the young Laura Foreman, contributed an installation she called \\"Roomwork\\" to the interior of the munitions factory. However, Shifreen's landlord, the police, and then reportedly violent local members of the Jewish Defense League took offense to her exhibit's inclusion of a painting of Hitler. A few days after the opening, members of the Jewish Defense League entered the exhibit and slashed another painting by Komar and Melamid, the show closing down soon after. The Monument Redefined (1982) Poster seen around New York After the success of the first, Shifreen and artist Scott Siken began organizing a second show. Entitled The Monument Redefined, the 1982 show was held in three locations. The outdoor site covered twelve acres with artwork visible from the window of Brooklyn's F subway. The space for the two indoor sites was donated by the Downtown Brooklyn Cultural Center, while sponsors included the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Decentralization Program of the New York State Council on the Arts, The City of New York, Con Edison, the F.W. Woolworth Company, and the Organization of Independent Artists. The stated theme of the exhibition was not size, but social responsibility. The call-for-entries was again a poster, but also free ads from Artforum, Arts, and Artnews, and thousands of artists submitted entrees. The co-curators selected 400 proposals, including works by well-known artists such as Carl Andre, Christo, Vito Acconci, Nancy Holt, the controversial Chris Burden, Dennis Oppenheim, Nancy Spero, Leon Golub, Boaz Vaadia, TODT, sculptor Jim Nickel, and Fred Wilson. Some of the co-jurors were Marcia Tucker, the director of the New Museum, Henry Geldzahler, the New York City Cultural Commissioner, and Mary Boone, the gallery owner. Reception As before, the show was a success, with multiple art publications publishing reviews. Three panel discussions were held at Cooper Union, and artists as well as art critics took part. On October 3, 1982, there was a review in The New York Times. Gowanus Canal Redefined (1982) The Monument Redefined was welcomed by much of the local Gowanus, Brooklyn, community. Buddy Scotto and James Albano of the Gowanus Community Development Program contacted the Gowanus Memorial Artyard to offer a sponsorship for an architectural competition. Called The Gowanus Canal Redefined, it was one of the only grassroots contests of its kind. Frank Shifreen and Scott Siken of the Gowanus Memorial Artyard organized and curated the event, selecting proposals for \\"critical reinterpretations\\" of the Gowanus Canal. A $1000 prize was to be awarded to the best architectural proposal for revitalizing the Gowanus Canal area. The area, a former industrial zone, was suffering from extreme neglect in the early 1980s. The Canal running through the area is currently dubbed a Super fund site. The area's seawater canal, open park spaces, and close proximity to Manhattan and public transportation were requested to be incorporated into the proposal designs. The show ran from October 18, 1982, to October 29, 1982, and included participants Todd Ayoung, Dennis Joyce, Stephen Korns, Joe Lewis, Brian McMahon, and Kristin Steen. Historical significance The show was one of several mega-shows in the early 1980s. Before the show, the public Times Square Show exhibition had nightly art performances every night for months, and in the two years after that there were several large-scale exhibitions in disused buildings in public locations. One was Ninth Street Survival at an abandoned school on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, as well as the Coney Island Show on a pier at the Coney Island Amusement Park. Several New York artists, including Shifreen and Julius Vitali, have theorized that the East Village, Manhattan art movement in the 1980s may have resulted partly from the artist-organized and not-for-profit shows of the early 1980s, including The Monumental Show and Monument Redefined. The shows made it possible for art galleries and art dealers to find and support emerging artists.

The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the urban locality (an urban-type settlement) of Umba. District's population: The population of Umba accounts for 88.0% of the district's total population. Geography Most of the district's territory is at a low elevation, but there are some hills in the west. It has many lakes, such as Lakes Kanozero, Segozero, and Vyalozero, and many rivers, including the Vyala, the Serga, and the Umba. History The district was established on August 1, 1927, when the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two Resolutions: \\"On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast\\" and \\"On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast\\".Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 34-35 According to these resolutions, Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug, which was divided into six districts (Tersky being one of them) and included into Leningrad Oblast. The administrative center of the district was established in the selo of Kuzomen; however, it was transferred to Umba on August 15, 1931.A Guide to the State Archives, p. 194 In 1934, the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee developed a redistricting proposal, which was approved by the Resolution of the 4th Plenary Session of the Murmansk Okrug Committee of the VKP(b) on December 28-29, 1934 and by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee on February 2, 1935.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 47‚Äì48 On February 15, 1935, the VTsIK approved the redistricting of the okrug into seven districts, but did not specify what territories the new districts were to include. On February 26, 1935, the Presidium of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee worked out the details of the new district scheme and issued a resolution, which, among other things, moved the administrative center of Tersky District to the work settlement of Lesnoy. On December 26, 1962, when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR decreed to re- organize the Soviets of People's Deputies and the executive committees of the krais, oblasts, and districts into the industrial and agricultural soviets, Murmansk Oblast was not affected and kept one unified Oblast Soviet and the executive committee.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 56 Nevertheless, on February 1, 1963, the Decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR established the new structure of the districts of Murmansk Oblast, which classified Tersky District as rural. However, this classification only lasted for less than two years. The November 21, 1964 Decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR restored the unified Soviets of People's Deputies and the executive committees of the krais and oblasts where the division into the urban and rural districts was introduced in 1962, and the districts of Murmansk Oblast were re-categorized as regular districts again by the January 12, 1965 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Decree. Economy There is almost no heavy industry in the district. Fishing is the main economic activity. There are large reserves of pegmatite. The timber industry makes up over half of the industrial production of the district. Unemployment is the biggest problem in the district, with the unemployment rate being 19.3%. Politics The local representative body is the Council of Deputies of Tersky District. It has fifteen deputies elected for a four-year term. The Chair of the Council of Deputies is Sergey Volkov. The Head of the District Administration is Leonid Shevelyov, who was appointed by the Council of Deputies.

Originally constructed by the Wallkill Valley Railroad to continue its rail line from New Paltz to Kingston, the bridge rises above Rondout Creek, spanning both Route 213 and the former Delaware and Hudson Canal. Construction on the trestle began in late 1870, and continued until early 1872. When it opened to rail traffic on April 6, 1872, the Rosendale trestle was the highest span bridge in the United States. The trestle was rebuilt in 1895 by the King Bridge Company to address public concerns regarding its stability, and it has been repeatedly reinforced throughout its existence. Concern over the sturdiness of the trestle has persisted since its opening, and was a major reason Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley rail line in 1977. After the rail line's closure, Conrail sold the bridge in 1986 for one dollar to a private businessman who tried unsuccessfully to operate the trestle as a bungee jumping platform in the 1990s. A similar attempt was made the following decade. The trestle was seized by the county in 2009 for tax nonpayment, and renovated as a pedestrian walkway for the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. The deck and railings now continue all the way across the trestle, and access is from a parking lot about north on Binnewater Road. It opened to the public with a celebration on June 29, 2013.  History   Construction  The railroad bridge as it was originally built, prior to its 1895 reconstruction In 1870, the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated trains between Montgomery and New Paltz, New York, and began building a bridge south of Rosendale, at Springtown Road, to cross the Wallkill River. The Springtown bridge was completed by 1871, and the rail line was opened north to the town of Rosendale. Rosendale issued $92,800 in bonds on May 13, 1869 to finance its portion of the railroad. Though the trestle was difficult to build, and viewed as weak by modern standards, it was remarkable for its time, and can be considered the \\"most awesome part\\" of the Wallkill Valley rail line. Construction on the bridge's abutments began in August 1870 by A. L. Dolby & Company, but work on the superstructure by the Waston Manufacturing Company did not begin until the following year due to problems with quicksand during the excavation. Sections of the superstructure were built in Paterson, New Jersey. The bridge originally had seven wrought-iron spans and two shorter wooden spans; the longer spans were each in length. The bridge cost $250,000 to build, and followed a Post truss design. Roughly of iron and of timber went into its construction. At the time of its completion in January 1872, it had the highest span of any bridge in the United States. Due to its height, it could \\"scarcely be crossed for the first time without something like a feeling of terror\\". The bridge allowed the rail line to continue north to Kingston.  Active rail service  A depiction of two women walking under the trestle, in the area known as \\"Dead Man's Stretch\\" The bridge was opened on April 6, 1872 in a ceremony attended by 5,000 people, including prominent men from across Ulster, Orange, and Dutchess counties. One of the spectators was James S. McEntee, Esq., an engineer who had worked on the Delaware and Hudson Canal in 1825. He was the only person to have seen both \\"the passage of the first loaded boat through the canal and the first train over the bridge which spans it\\". A 4-4-0 locomotive with five boxcars and two passenger cars made the inaugural run. Many spectators doubted the strength of the bridge, and believed that the trestle would collapse under the weight of the train. The bridge appeared unaffected by the strain, and an increasing number of people rode over the bridge during the second and third runs. A. L. Dolby & Company was contracted to complete the rail line between the bridge and Kingston. The track reached the Kingston Union Station in November 1872. By this time, trains were running regularly to and from Kingston. By 1885, the bridge supports were reinforced and the track was converted from broad gauge to standard gauge. In 1888, the Wallkill Valley Railroad received a permit from the town of Rosendale to \\"construct and maintain abutments to support [the] trestle\\" as long as such work did not interfere with traffic along the underlying highway (present-day NY 213). That same year, the Delaware and Hudson Canal allowed the railroad to temporarily use some of its property by the Rondout Creek to place bents for bridge repairs. The waterway beneath the trestle could be quite treacherous; so many people drowned that the area became known as \\"Dead Man's Stretch\\". There have been reports of ghostly \\"apparitions\\" in the area, particularly of a white dog. The trestle, spanning the former Delaware and Hudson Canal, as well as Rondout Creek The bridge was rebuilt by the King Bridge Company between 1895 and 1896, remaining in use most of the time; the trestle is the only railroad bridge featured in the King Bridge Company catalogs of the 1880s and 1890s that remains standing. The renovation converted the bridge's structure from iron and wood to steel to allay public concerns about its strength; the height of the bridge evoked collapses such as the Tay Bridge disaster. The steel was provided by the Carnegie Steel Company. The renovation raised the bridge's piers by and made the bridge straighter; the original design had a curve on the southern terminus. One of the northern spans was completed by February 1896, and the entire reconstruction was finished by June. The layout of the spans was unchanged from the original 1872 design. Following its reconstruction, the bridge was unaffected by the shock of a large cave-in at a nearby Rosendale cement quarry on December 26, 1899, though it was shaken by a nearby boiler explosion that occurred days before the collapse. From the time of its reconstruction to its eventual closure, passengers continued to have concerns over the trestle. The \\"speed, weight, and positioning of rolling stock on the bridge\\" was monitored, and it was repeatedly reinforced to \\"carry the ever heavier loads of modern railroading\\". In the 1940s, steam engines carrying heavy loads over the bridge caused the catwalk on the west side of the bridge to shake. By 1975, the rail line had deteriorated to the point where federal regulations allowed only traffic over the trestle, though engineers were instructed to only go as fast as . The sturdiness of the bridge, specifically the stability of its piers, was a deciding factor when Conrail (then-owner of the Wallkill Valley rail line) closed the Wallkill Valley Railroad in 1977.  Modern use  Hikers on the re-opened trestle Conrail had begun taking bids on the trestle as early as 1983. An initial offer was made to the town of Rosendale, which refused, unwilling to accept the liability. Conrail sold the bridge, along with of the Wallkill Valley rail corridor, in 1986 to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar. Rahl took title of the trestle and corridor on July 11, 1986. Included in Rahl's purchase was a train station in Rosendale's hamlet of Binnewater; the station was a part of the Binnewater Historic District. A Rosendale homeowner association had tried to purchase the properties before Rahl, also for one dollar, but Conrail declined their offer. Rahl, born around 1948 in Washingtonville, was a construction worker and auto mechanic. He lived near the trestle, in a \\"converted warehouse, whose support beams had once formed the scaffolding for the trestle crews\\". Rahl's reason for buying the rail line was originally to open a \\"dining car restaurant\\" along the corridor, and to establish a tourist railroad from Kingston to the trestle. He claimed the purchase granted him the right to \\"restore rail service on the whole Wallkill line\\", and joint ownership of Conrail. Plans to restore service subsequently \\"didn't pan out\\". Within one year of the purchase, Rahl sold of the property to a housing developer. On May 16, 1989, a storm caused such severe damage to the Binnewater station that part of it broke off and fell into the road; the building was subsequently demolished by the town of Rosendale's highway department. View from the trestle of Joppenbergh Mountain (left), NY 213 (center), and Rondout Creek (right) Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl installed planking and guard rails on the southern half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He allowed bungee jumping off the bridge until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to execute a bungee jump off the bridge without a restraining cord. The bridge was slightly damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year. Douglas Hase, an entrepreneur who had run bungee-jumping and hot air ballooning companies, tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for another bungee-jumping venture. During a public hearing about Hase's proposal, a county legislator began screaming to simulate the sound neighbours would hear repetitively when people jumped off the bridge. After Rahl failed to pay $13,716 in property taxes over a period of three years, Ulster County foreclosed on the entire property on April 15, 2009. The Wallkill Valley Land Trust and Open Space Conservancy offered to purchase the property, and the county authorized the sale in July. The sale was completed in late August 2009. The Land Trust agreed to pay all outstanding taxes before receiving full ownership and adding it to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. Ownership of the trestle was transferred to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail Association. An engineer from Bergmann Associates surveying the trestle in late 2010 Following an engineering survey by Bergmann Associates ‚Äì the same firm that inspected the Poughkeepsie Bridge prior to its conversion to a walkway ‚Äì the bridge was closed to the public in June 2010 for repairs. Renovations were originally expected to cost $750,000 and begin in early 2011, with a 12-month completion time. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation granted $150,000 toward the renovation. By November 2010, an additional $300,000 had been raised from private donors, and other sources. By the end of 2010, over of tires were removed from the Rosendale section of the rail trail. The surface of the walkway was rebuilt with a wood-plastic composite built by a volunteer force. On February 17, 2011, a Bergmann Associates employee used the trestle as a case study in a seminar on adaptive reuse of defunct railroad bridges. By late March 2011, the estimated cost of renovating the trestle had risen to $1.1 million, and the expected time to completion increased to two years. The northern half of the trestle in 2008, without decking or guard railsA campaign to raise $500,000 for the renovation began on March 27, 2011; by June 30, about $50,000 had been raised. Two 2009 lawsuits brought by John E. Rahl against the New York Telephone Company over alleged fees due to him for a fiber optic line crossing the trestle were dismissed by two lower courts (in Vermont and New York). On November 18, 2011, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed Rahl's appeal.John E. Rahl v. New York Telephone Company, Case No. 11-2266 , a lawsuit brought by John Rahl over the ownership of the trestle remains pending before the Second Circuit Court. Rahl claimed that he retained ownership of the property because only the state, and not the county, had the right to seize the trestle, which was \\"forever railroad under 19th century eminent domain legal doctrines ‚Äì long forgotten by modern jurisprudence\\". The trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, and at least one wedding. In late June 2012, contractors began welding new railings to the trestle and conducting other preparatory work for opening the walkway. An event at nearby Willow Kiln Park was held on June 29, 2013 to celebrate the grand opening of the trestle to the public. The trestle was fully re-opened to the public for the first time since the rail line closed, and a segment of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail from Gardiner to Kingston was opened.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in an isolated position opposite the grounds of Kingerby Hall. History The earliest fabric in the church dates from the early 11th century. The church originally served a village which has subsequently been deserted. Additions and alterations were made to the church in the 12th, 13th, 14th and early 17th centuries, and minor repairs were undertaken in the 19th century. During the 14th and 15th centuries the lords of the manor were the Disney family. Sir William Disney fought with Edward, the Black Prince, and died in 1316. His son, also named Sir William, died in 1349 during the Black Death. They were ancestors of the film maker, Walt Disney. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the estate of Kingerby Hall was owned by Roman Catholic families, and was used to hide recusant priests. The last holders of the manor were the Young family. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in ironstone rubble with pantile roofs. Some of the walls have been patched with bricks or plaster. Its plan consists of a two-bay nave with a clerestory, a south aisle, a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. There are remnants of a north aisle which has been demolished. The tower tapers and has three stages separated by string courses. At the corners are buttresses rising to the top of the lowest stage. On the west side of the lowest stage is a window with a pointed arch and a trefoil head. The middle stage contains a flat-headed window on the south side. The bell openings in the top stage are paired, and have almost triangular heads. On the east side, above the roof, can be seen the line of an earlier roof which is thought to have dated from the 11th century. On the north side of the church are three large buttresses, and the blocked arcade from the previous north aisle. In the easternmost bay is a re-used 14th-century three-light window. There are no windows in the north face of the clerestory. The chancel is at a much lower level than the nave, and this reveals the line of the earlier roof on the east wall of the nave. The east window has two lights. On the south side of the chancel are a rectangular altar window, a narrow lancet window at a higher level, and a small single-light window at a low level. The south aisle has two-light windows on the east, south and west sides. The doorway to the porch dates from the early 13th century and has dog-tooth decoration. Inside the porch are stone benches. The doorway to the church dates from the 12th century and is round-arched. On the south side of the clerestory are two rectangular windows. Interior The two-bay south arcade has an octagonal pier with plain capitals. The nave has a king post roof carved with a heart and rosettes. At the west end of the nave, at a high level, is a circular opening dating from the early 11th century; it is likely to have been the west light of the original Anglo-Saxon church. In the east window of the aisle is stained glass dating from the 14th century. This depicts the Crucifixion, Saint Catherine with her wheel, and Saint Cecilia with an organ. In the east window of the aisle is stained glass dating from 1850. The octagonal font is from the 15th century, as is the prayer desk in the chancel. The pulpit dates from the 19th century. An alms box, carved from a single piece of wood, is carved with an inscription and the date 1639. In the west corner of the aisle are two monuments, consisting of effigies on tomb chests. One of the effigies is that of a knight from the middle of the 13th century, lying with his legs crossed, and with puppies lying beside his pillow. He carries a large shield and is dressed in a chain mail surcoat. The other effigy is from the late 14th century, and has been partly truncated. It consists of a knight, his hands held in prayer, and his feet on a dog. He is also dressed in chain mail and has a surcoat carved with heraldic symbols. In the chancel is a coffin-shaped slab carved in low relief. It depicts a 14th- century knight with a beard, and shows his head and the upper part of his body, and his shoes, but the lower part of his body and his legs have been replaced by an elaborate cross. The monuments are thought to represent members of the Disney family. In the chancel are three 19th-century marble memorials to members of the Young family of Kingerby Hall. External features In the churchyard is a tomb slab on a brick base dated 1699 which has been designated as a Grade II listed building.

The palaces are evidence of the luxurious lifestyle of the Hasmonean dynasty and of Herod the Great. They made extensive use of swimming pools, bathhouses, ornamental gardens and orchards. The palaces were not far from Jerusalem ‚Äì 20 km along the ancient Roman road.  History of excavations  Roman aqueduct near Jericho The site was excavated in the 19th century by Charles Warren, who attempted to locate the place of Biblical Jericho. After making an archaeological trench, he concluded that this site is from the Roman period. Additional excavations were conducted by the Germans Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger, in 1910‚Äì1911, but the results have never been published. In 1950, two expeditions from the United States dug on the site. An ornamental garden with magnificent remains from the time of Herod was discovered north of the southern tell, and labeled \\"the sunken garden.\\"Herod's Judaea: A Mediterranean State in the Classic World, Samuel Rocca Farther north were discovered the remains of a building, identified as a gymnasium. After the Yom Kippur War in 1973, extensive excavations were conducted on site by archaeologist Ehud Netzer. The excavations continued for ten seasons and covered an area of 30 hectares. The excavations also revealed remains of aqueducts to the west of Jericho. At the oasis of Jericho, Netzer uncovered new wings of Herod's winter palace, as well as a Hasmonean (Maccabean) winter palace containing a number of swimming pools and gardens.The Hasmonean Winter Palaces in the Jericho Valley, 2000 The complex includes the Jericho synagogue, built 7050 BC and identified as one of the oldest synagogues ever found.  Site description  Excavation site Survey and excavations show that the site covers an area of 120 hectares, and is only part of Second Temple- period Jericho. A series of winter palaces were discovered, some which were shown to have been built by the Hasmoneans, and others by Herod the Great, who inherited the older estate and substantially expanded the palatial compound with new buildings. It turned out that the area of the city of Jericho was very broad. South of one of the palaces, in the area that today is the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, remains of luxurious houses were discovered, scattered over dozens of acres. A royal farm was discovered north of the palaces, covering an area of 450 dunams. A close connection was found between the farm and the winter palaces. Aqueducts, which were built during the Hasmonean period, enabled the construction of the winter palaces and the farm. Two aqueducts brought water to the site from the following springs that flow year- round: * Wadi Qelt: Ein Perat, Ein Mabua, Ein Qelt. * Nahal Na'aran: Ein Noema, Ein Diuk, Ein Shusha.  Hasmonean palace  The Hasmonean winter palace, at the northern part of the site, consisted of the following structures: * The main building * Swimming pool complex * Southern division (\\"twin palaces\\") The Hasmonean palace was built on a hill overlooking the city of Jericho. The palace was built by John Hyrcanus I (134-104 BCE) and believed to have been fortified during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 BCE). A strong earthquake in 31 BCE destroyed the palace. Evidence to this was found in different parts of the complex. On its site King Herod built an artificial tell, or mound, on which he built his second palace. The establishment of the mound resulted in coverage of the Hasmonean palace, and thus parts of it were preserved, such as a building wall remaining 7 metres high. The main structure of the Hasmonean palace was 50 by 50 metres. Elements of the building were as was customary for luxury palaces in the area: * Rooms were decorated with colorful frescoes, imitating marble. * Stucco decorations in the form of building stones. * An unroofed central courtyard. * The water flowed into the swimming pools and buildings through clay and lead pipes, buried in the ground, and aqueducts supplied water to gardens and orchards. Remains were found of two pairs of swimming pools: a small pair west of the palace, and a large pair north of it. It is speculated that the pools were the focus of entertainment and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the palace. Perhaps they are also the place where, according to historian Josephus, Aristobulus III (53-36 BC), the last high priest from the Hasmonean dynasty, was drowned. South of the large pools was a luxurious 21 by 17 metres building, the so-called pavilion, built in the style of a Doric temple. An axis of symmetry passed through the pools, the open courtyard, and the temple north of them. The \\"twin palaces\\" were two surprisingly similar buildings. The hypothesis is that they were built by Queen Shlomtzion (ruled 67‚Äì76 BCE) for her two sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, in order to soften the rivalry between them that lasted nearly thirty years. The size of the palaces was 25 by 25 metres. Each of the two palaces contained a luxurious bathhouse. Many ritual baths were found around the palace, required by their priestly owners, who had to be ritually purified before eating terumah. A ritual bath for vessels was also found, containing the remains of 800 bowls. The palace also served the last Hasmonean king, Antigonus Matityahu II (r. 40-37 BCE), as evidenced by a hoard of 20 coins.  Herod's first palace  The first palace was situated on the southern bank of Wadi Qelt, on land leased from Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, who received it as a gift from Mark Antony in 36 BCE.Jericho- The Winter Palace of King Herod Meanwhile, in the north, the Hasmonean palace was still standing. The palace was a rectangular building, 86 by 46 meters. In the center was an open courtyard with perimeter columns and a central pool draining the rainwater. In the palace were a magnificent hall, a luxurious bathhouse, and a pair of deep pools, which were apparently ritual baths. The palace was exposed in 1951 by Pritchard, who thought it was a gymnasium. After excavation of the palace, it was covered over with sand.  Herod's second palace  The second palace was built in 31 BCE. Herod won the trust of Emperor Augustus and in return received the Jericho area he had previously lost to the by then defunct Queen Cleopatra. After the earthquake of 31 BCE Herod decided to build a second palace on the ruins of the Hasmonean palace. He combined the pools of the Hasmonean palace into one large pool, 32 by 18 meters. The second palace (north of Wadi Qelt), along with the first palace (south of Wadi Qelt), served Herod for residential and ceremonial purposes. A unique feature of the second palace was its residential wing, which contained a designated recreation area. The villa was built on an artificial tell covering the Hasmonean palace: 35 by 43 meters tall, eight meters above the surroundings, providing a view of the estate's orchards and the surroundings. The second palace was full of gardens. In the pleasure wing were the big pool and a bathhouse, which has been well preserved.  Herod's third palace  Bath from Herod's third palace The third palace was the most magnificent of the palaces. It was established on both sides of Wadi Qelt. Ehud Netzer, the editor of excavations at the site, believe that palace residents could see water flowing in the riverbed for up to two months a year, letting the viewers feel like they were on the edge of an actual river. The builders, who apparently were from Italy, used construction methods that were common in their homeland such as: * Opus reticulatum - small stones, 10 cm by 10 cm, placed in diagonal rows. In Jericho they were anointed with white or colored plaster. * Opus Koodroas - rectangular stones. Local mud bricks were also layered on top of stone construction. After being covered with plaster, there was no difference between them and the models from Italy. The third palace of Herod, in the center of the site, included the following buildings: * The north wing. * Sunken garden. * The southern mound. * Big pool.  Industrial area  The industrial area was next to residential buildings and service buildings.  Royal estate  In the estate a huge wine-press was found, which was probably used for making wine and \\"date honey\\". Farm crops, according to literary sources, were: palm trees, persimmon resin, and sap, which produced perfumes and medicines. Some of them were sent overseas. It was an intelligent use of the warm climate of the place.

Fighting occurred in the eastern Congo between 1892 and 1894. It was a proxy war, with most of the fighting being done by native Congolese, who aligned themselves with either side and sometimes switched sides.Edgerton, pp. 94‚Äì95 The causes of the war were largely economic based, since Leopold and the Arabs were contending to gain control of the wealth of the Congo.Edgerton, p. 85 The war ended in January 1894 with a victory of Leopold's Force Publique. Initially, King Leopold II collaborated with the Arabs, but competition struck over the control of ivory and the topic of Leopold II's humanitarian pledges to the Berlin Conference to end slavery. Leopold II's stance turned confrontational against his once-allies.Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja: The Congo: From Leopold to Kabila: A People's History, 2002, , page 21. The war against the Swahili-Arab economic and political power was presented as a Christian anti-slavery crusade. Prelude In 1886, while Tippu Tip was in Zanzibar, a dispute arose between a fort at Stanley Falls led by Tippu Tip, and a smaller, nearby Congo Free State fort led by Walter Deane (a British captain) and Lt Dubois (a Belgian lieutenant). Tip's men at the Stanley Falls fort alleged that Deane had stolen a slave woman from an Arab officer there. Deane asserted that the girl had fled after being badly beaten by her master, and that he had only offered her refuge.Edgerton, Robert.(2002) The Troubled Heart of Africa: A History of the Congo. St. Martin's Press. A photograph of a slave boy in Zanzibar c. 1890 Tippu Tip's men attacked the fort ‚Äî the Congo Free State fort was defended by the two officers, eighty Nigerian Hausas and sixty local militiamen ‚Äî and after a four-day siege, the defenders ran out of ammunition and fled, abandoning the fort.Edgerton, p. 94 The Free State made no counterattack, and Tippu Tip began to move more men into the Congo, including several Arab slaver captains and also some Congolese leaders, such as Gongo Lutete. Arab East African slave routes c. 1890 Initially, the authority of the Congo Free State was relatively weak in the eastern regions of the Congo. In early 1887, Henry Morton Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip (nom de guerre‚Äîhis real name was Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi) be made governor (wali) of the Stanley Falls District in the Congo Free State. Both Leopold II and Barghash bin Said agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.Bennett and Brode Tippu Tip agreed to submit to Congo Free State authority and to allow a Congo Free State Resident by his side to help him govern this territory‚Äîinspired by the indirect rule governance system used by the British Empire and in the Dutch East Indies. The borders of his territories were the Aruwimi and the Lualaba River. Additionally Tippu Tip was to redirect his ivory trade through the Congo Free State, to the ports located at the Atlantic Ocean and he was to assist King Leopold II ‚Äòs forces in their expeditions to the Upper Nile, to help further expand his territories. Soon after making this deal, it became apparent that Tippu Tip was not inclined to accept Congo Free State authority and considered himself more of a vassal than a state official, allowed to do as he pleased, within certain boundaries. Furthermore, Tippu Tip did not have absolute authority over the eastern Congo region, but was considered as a primus inter pares. Other major slave traders like Rumaliza, the strongman of Lake Tanganyika, considered his deal with the Congo Free State to be treason. Rumaliza abolished the Congo Free State flag and swore loyalty to the red flag of the sultan of Zanzibar. Leopold II was heavily criticized in European public opinion for his dealings with Tippu Tip. In Belgium, the Belgian Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1888, mainly by Roman Catholic intellectuals led by count Hippolyte d'Ursel, aimed to abolish the Arab slave trade . Around 1890-91, Tippu Tip returned to Zanzibar, where he retired; Sefu bin Hamid represented his father in the eastern Congo region of Kasongo and carried on the war in his stead. Course of the war In March and April 1892, Tippu Tip's son Sefu bin Hamid began to lead various attacks on Congo Free State (CFS) personnel in the eastern Congo, including ivory trader Arthur Hodister‚Äîsent by the Syndicat Commercial du Katanga to 'acquire' ivory‚Äîand Captain Guillaume Van Kerckhoven, who had been confiscating ivory by force from several powerful Arab traders.Edgerton, p. 99 These expeditions played a huge role in uniting the slave and ivory traders in the region, in the fight against their common enemy, the Congo Free State.Edgerton, p. 98 In 1892 The Times reported that, during further explorations in the Congo, Hodister was captured and killed, his head stuck on a pole. Relations were further strained when Rashid ben Mohammed, Tippu Tip's nephew and resident Arab leader in Stanley Falls, refused to assist in the investigation of Hodister's death.Boulger, p. 162 Gongo Lutete also led actions in the east at this time.Ewans, Martin (2001). European atrocity, African catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its aftermath. Richmond: Curzon. p. 139. . Initial hostilities Francis Dhanis in the Congo. His better-armed forces were to defeat Rumaliza, c. 1900 The Force Publique, under Francis Dhanis, was sent to Katanga to resupply the trading post of Lofoi, and establish new outposts on his path. During this mission, the Force Publique crossed paths with the soldiers of Gongo Lutete‚Äî captured by Tippu Tip as a boy, after winning his freedom he became the leader of the Batetela and Bakusu tribes. Gongo Letete was heading to Kasa√Ø in the west, to pick up weapon supplies from Angola, in an attempt to strengthen his position in the Lomani region. After several skirmishes in April‚ÄìMay 1892 with the better equipped Free State forces of Dhanis and Michaux, Ngongo Lutete decided to make a deal with the Congo Free State. On the 19th of September he switched sides and joined the Force Publique - other native leaders like Pania Mutomba before him and Lupungu, chief of the Songe at Kabinda shortly thereafter, also had joined the Force Publique. Maniema campaign By October 1892, Sefu was leading a force of 10,000 men, some 500 Zanzibari officers and the remaining were Congolese. The Force Publique army under the command of Francis Dhanis, consisted of a few dozen Belgian officers and several thousand African auxiliaries.Cyclopedia, p. 190 Open warfare broke out in late November 1892, when Sefu set up a fort on the Lomami River, where he was attacked by the Force Publique and eventually was forced to retreat. Dhanis used this battle as a pretext for advancing against the Arabs in force.Pakenham, p. 433 He allowed his army to travel with all of their wives, slaves, and servants, who did all of the army's cooking and cleaning and acted as a supply train. In addition, he did not allow his men to harm local non-combatants, earning him goodwill of the local Congolese people.Edgerton, p. 100 Rumaliza campaign Muhammad bin Khalfan bin Khamis al-Barwani alias Rumaliza, 1900 By this time, the Congo Free State gained in military strength in the region and became less tolerant of \\"Arab\\" strongmen, determined to stamp them out. The Congo Free State forces under Francis Dhanis launched a new campaign against the slave traders in 1892, and Rumaliza was one of the main targets. By 1892, the Swahili slave and ivory trader Rumaliza dominated Tanganyika from his base at Ujiji on the old slave route that led from Stanley Falls up the Lualaba River to Nyangwe, east to Lake Tanganyika and then via Tabora to Bagamoyo opposite Zanzibar. The total number of Swahili fighters in this huge region numbered around one hundred thousand, but each chief acted independently from the main body. Although experienced in warfare, they were poorly armed with simple rifles. The Belgians had just six hundred troops divided between the camps at Basoko and Lusambo, but were much better armed and had six cannons and a machine gun. In the previous years (1886-1891), the Society of Missionaries of Africa had founded Catholic missions at the north and south ends of Lake Tanganyika. L√©opold Louis Joubert, a French soldier and armed auxiliary, was dispatched by Archbishop Charles Lavigerie's Society of Missionaries of Africa to protect the missionaries. The missionaries abandoned three of the new stations due to attacks by Tippu Tip and Rumaliza.\\"Il y a 80 ans, le 27 Mai 1927, Mourait le Captiaine Joubert\\" (in French). Lavigerie. Retrieved 2013-04-09. By 1891, the slavers had control of the entire western shore of the lake, apart from the region defended by Joubert around Mpala and St Louis de Mrumbi.Shorter, Aylward (2003). \\"Joubert, Leopold Louis\\". Dictionary of African Christian Biography. Retrieved 2013-04-10. The anti- slavery expedition under Captain Alphonse Jacques‚Äîfinanced by the Belgian Anti-Slavery Society‚Äîcame to the relief of Joubert on 30 October 1891. When the Jacques expedition arrived Joubert's garrison was down to about two hundred men, poorly armed with \\"a most miscellaneous assortment of chassepots, Remingtons and muzzle-loaders, without suitable cartridges.\\" He also had hardly any medicine left.Moloney, Joseph Augustus (30 July 2007).

KARTHALA Editions. p. 96. . Captain Jacques asked Joubert to remain on the defensive while his expedition moved north. On the 3rd of January 1892, Captain Alphonse Jacques' anti-slavery expedition founded the fortress of Albertville on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, and tried to put an end to the slave trade in the region. Rumaliza's troops surrounded Albertville on the 5th of April and besieged the outpost for 9 months. Eventually Rumaliza's forces had to retreat because of the arrival of the Long-Duvivier- Demol Anti-Slavery expedition, a relief column sent from Brussels at captain Alphonse Jacques's aide. The capture of Nyangwe and Kasongo On 4 March 1893 the Congo Free State forces under Francis Dhanis took control of a key river city by the name of Nyangwe after a 6-week standoff that devastated the city. Of the 1000 original buildings in the city, only one remained standing.Edgerton, pp. 102‚Äì104Wack, p. 192 On the 9th of March, the Congo Free State encampment at Nyangwe was struck by a virulent form of influenza; by the end of the first week, nearly all men were infected. At about that time, Sefu began sending smallpox cases from all over the district to Nyangwe, his ruse succeeded, and influenza was followed by an epidemic of smallpox. The mortality both from smallpox and influenza among Lutete's people and the other native allies of the Congo Free State was substantial. Following these events, Sefu sent ambassadors to Nyangwe, bringing with them Lutete's oldest son and daughter, whom he had held as hostages, in return for a 10-day ceasefire. Dhanis agreed, giving his soldiers a chance of recovering from the effects of their sickness. Commandant Gillian arrived with Congo Free State reinforcements on the 13th of April. Dhanis advanced up the river to Kasongo on 22 April 1893, while sending Lieutenant Doorme and his advanced-guard to encircle the city, surprising the Arab slavers and taking all their defenses in the rear. The force publique found a huge supply store at Kasongo including ivory, ammunition, food and luxuries such as gold and crystal tableware. For the next six months, Dhanis remained inactive, setting up supply routes and befriending the local tribes, while Rumaliza's forces were swelled by Swahili fighters who had escaped after earlier defeat by Dhanis. Fight for the Stanley Falls The steamer Ville-de-Bruxelles on the Congo River, 1890 In 1893, Louis-Napol√©on Chaltin was head of the Force Publique station at Basoko‚Äîthe camp at Basoko had been established by the Congo Free State as a precaution, in the event of a quarrel with the Arab slave and ivory traders at Stanley Falls. Captain Chaltin and Richard Mohun‚Äîa commercial agent for the United States and the commander of the artillery battery attached to this expedition‚Äîwere ordered in May 1893 to join Captain Dhanis' forces near Kasongo. Chaltin went up the Lomami River to Bena-Kamba with two river steamers, then striking overland to Riba Riba, near present-day Kindu. At this point, smallpox had broken out in his caravan and Chaltin was forced to return to Basoko. Chaltin arrived at Stanley Falls on the 18th of May, where Captain Tobback and Lieutenant Van Lint had for five days been resisting the attacks of the forces of Rashid ben Mohammed, the nephew of Tippu Tip. On the landing of the troops from Basoko at Stanley Falls, the Arab attackers decamped, leaving the town. After defeating them again at Kirundu, the Arab traders were expelled from the region. Chaltin went on to secure the Dungu region in the northeast of the Congo Free State, and was commander of the Haut-U√©l√© district from 1893. On the 25th of June 1893, Commandant Pierre Ponthier arrived at the Stanley Falls from Europe. He immediately collected all the troops he could, took Captain Hubert Lothaire and some men from Bangala with him and followed the Arab units, who had fled from the Stanley Falls up the river. After some severe fighting and many skirmishes, he cleared the river and its neighbourhood, as far as Nyangwe. During a fortnight's severe fighting, Commandant Ponthier's attacks on the forts of Rumaliza failed and Ponthier was killed in action. Rumaliza's last stand Attack on Rumaliza's fort, 1893 German East Africa, 1894. Albertville, Marungu (and Mpala) are to the west of the southern portion of Lake Tanganyika. In 1893 Tippu Tip advised Rumaliza to retire from the trade, but Rumaliza first had to look after his people at Lake Tanganyika. Rumaliza raised a strong force, which clashed with Dhanis' column on 15 October 1893 causing the death of two European leaders and fifty of their soldiers. On 19 October 1893 Rumaliza attacked a position one day's march from Kasongo. Dhanis concentrated his forces and defeated Rumaliza. The war's last major battle occurred on 20 October 1893, on the Luama River, west of Lake Tanganyika. It was a tactical stalemate, but Sefu was killed, and the remaining resistance soon fell apart.Edgerton 104Ewans, p. 140 By 24 December 1893, Dhanis had obtained reinforcements and was ready to advance again. Rumaliza had also received assistance. Dhanis sent one column under Gillain to prevent Rumaliza from retreating, and another under De Wouters to advance on Rumaliza's fort near Bena Kalunga. A group of fresh forces coming to Rumaliza's aid from German East Africa was headed off, and Dhanis's forces closed in on Rumaliza's bomas (Swahili for fort). On 9 January 1894 Belgian reinforcements arrived under Captain Hubert Lothaire, and the same day a shell blew up Rumaliza's ammunition store and burned down the fort containing it. Most of the occupants were killed while attempting to escape. Within three days the remaining forts, cut off from water and other supplies, surrendered. More than two thousand prisoners were taken. A column under Lothaire pursued him to the north of Lake Tanganyika, destroying his fortified positions along the route, although Rumaliza himself managed to escape. At the lake they joined with the anti-slavery expedition led by Captain Alphonse Jacques Rumaliza took refuge in the German colony of German East Africa. The war ended in a victory for the Free State by January 1894.  Aftermath and impact  The war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths among both combatants and civilians, and significantly altered the political and economic geography of the Congo. The market around Nyangwe ceased to exist, while the city of Kasongo was all but destroyed. With the absence of these markets and the Arab traders themselves, much of the exports of the Congo were rerouted from their destinations in East Africa to the Stanley Pool and the Atlantic Ocean. The participation of the Batetela and Bakusu tribes in the war marked the transcendence of their societies' traditional values by desires for wealth and power through expansionism, assimilation, and cultural exchange. Their involvement in the slave trade made Belgian authorities wary of them, and in turn they were neglected during colonial rule.

Biography He was born in Hu√°nuco. He was son of the then colonel Mariano Ignacio Prado (later general and president of Peru in the periods 1865-1868 and 1876-1879) and Mar√≠a Avelina Guti√©rrez. He would be the firstborn of his father, of the six children he would later have, not of the same mother. The last brother he would have, Manuel Prado Ugarteche, would also be president of Peru (periods 1939-1945 and 1956-1962). From an early age he was attracted to the military career. His father, who at that time was the commander of the Lanceros de la Uni√≥n regiment (Union Lancers Regiment), allowed him to enter that military corps at the age of 8 years, having the rank of corporal at 9 years old. In 1865 he participated in the victorious revolution led by his father against President Juan Antonio Pezet. After the war he began studies at the College of Our Lady of Guadalupe. At the age of thirteen he left his school to fight against the Spaniards in the squadron that sailed to the south of Chile and participated in the Battle of Abtao, where he was promoted to guardiamarina. Then he participated in the Battle of Callao in 1866 and was then promoted to the rank of ensign. At the age of 21, he went to Cuba to participate in the fight for the independence of the Caribbean country. There he became a soldier of the so-called Ten Years' War. He then fought under the orders of M√°ximo G√≥mez and alongside leaders such as Antonio Maceo Grajales and Jos√© Maceo, Guillermo Moncada and others on the Eastern front. In November 1876, almost without weapons or ammunition, Leoncio Prado and ten other men captured the Spanish steam Moctezuma, with the objective of taking the war to the sea. He raised the Cuban flag on the ship and renamed it C√©spedes. He was pursued by several Spanish warships and after a time of persecution he was forced to self-sink his ship. Due to his actions in the war, he is granted the rank of colonel of the Cuban army. When Leoncio Prado was 26 years old, the war with Chile broke out and the young officer returned to Peru to defend his country. He participated in the navy and then in the army, forming part of the Tacna guerrillas. Leoncio Prado died in the Battle of Huamachuco in 1883, in the course of the War of the Pacific. The Leoncio Prado Military Academy is named after him.

Written by Alan Kirschenbaum and directed by Jace Alexander, the episode first aired in the United States on November 30, 2010 on Fox. This is the first episode so far where Maw Maw hasn't appeared. In the episode, Jimmy learns that as a baby he ruined Burt's dream of becoming a rock star. He decides to make up for it by inviting Smokey Floyd (Jason Lee) to perform at Grocery Palooza Plot When Barney is looking for an attraction for Grocery Palooza (which he constantly insists that Lollapalooza stole the name from them) Jimmy learns that when he was a baby, Burt gave up his dream of being a Rockstar for him. Jimmy then comes up with the idea to have Smokey Floyd, Burt's Rockhero, sing at Grocery Palooza, which Barney thinks is splendid. However, even though they get him, they soon find out Smokey Floyd is not all he's cracked up to be. Production The episode was written by Alan Kirschenbaum, his first writing credit for the series. The episode was also directed by Jace Alexander, his second directing credit for the series after \\"Meet the Grandparents\\". The episode also guest starred Jason Lee who had previously worked with Greg Garcia on My Name is Earl. Initially the producers were looking for an actual musician to play Smokey Floyd, but many had turned it down due to the \\"unflattering\\" nature of the character. They eventually turned the character into a fictional one and initially thought of Jason Lee. Lucas Neff, who plays Jimmy said in an interview that \\"They have such a rapport. Greg lets Jason just go and Jason just improvises half of the scene. They're bouncing ideas off of each other and the scene is constantly changing,\\" Jason had to wear makeup for the role to make him look older than he is. Cultural References When Smokey Floyd gets up on stage, he mistakenly calls Barney 'Kenny'.

It is claimed to be one of the simplest authenticated key exchange protocols among the related schemes, including MQV, HMQV, Station-to- Station protocol, SSL/TLS etc. The authentication is based on public key pairs. As with other protocols, YAK normally requires a Public Key Infrastructure to distribute authentic public keys to the communicating parties. Description Two parties, Alice and Bob, agree on a group G with generator g of prime order q in which the discrete log problem is hard. Typically a Schnorr group is used. In general, YAK can use any prime order group that is suitable for public key cryptography, including elliptic curve cryptography. Let g^a be Alice's long-term public key and g^b be Bob's. The protocol executes in one round: Alice selects x \\\\in_\\\\text{R} [0, q-1] and sends out g^x together with a zero-knowledge proof (using for example Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge proof as described in RFC 8235) for the proof of the exponent x. Similarly, Bob selects y \\\\in_\\\\text{R} [0, q-1] and sends out g^{y} together with a zero-knowledge proof for the proof of the exponent y. Here, the notation \\\\in_\\\\text{R} denotes an element selected randomly with uniform probability. The above communication can be completed in one round as neither party depends on the other. When it finishes, Alice and Bob verify the received zero-knowledge proofs. Alice then computes K = (g^{y} g^{b}) ^ {x + a}= g^{(x + a) (y + b)}. Similarly, Bob computes K = (g^{x} g^{a}) ^ {y + b} = g^{(x + a) (y + b)}. With the same keying material K, Alice and Bob can derive a session key using a cryptographic hash function: \\\\kappa = H(K). Security properties The use of well-established zero-knowledge proof primitives such as Schnorr's scheme greatly simplifies the security proofs. Given that the underlying zero knowledge proof primitive is secure, the YAK protocol aims to satisfy the following properties. # Private key security ‚Äì An attacker cannot learn the user's static private key even if he is able to learn all session- specific secrets in any compromised session. # Forward secrecy ‚Äì Session keys that were securely established in the past uncorrupted sessions will remain incomputable in the future even when both users' static private keys are disclosed. # Session key security ‚Äì An attacker cannot compute the session key if he impersonates a user but has no access to the user's private key. The security claims in the original YAK paper are based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption in a random oracle model. Cryptanalysis In 2015, Toorani mentioned that \\"the YAK protocol lacks joint key control and perfect forward secrecy attributes and is vulnerable to some attacks including unknown key-share and key-replication attacks\\" to which Hao has a different opinion. In 2020, Mohammad mentioned that YAK protocol cannot withstand the known key security attack which leads to a new key compromise impersonation attack where an adversary is allowed to reveal both the shared static secret key between two parties and the ephemeral private key of the initiator. The author also proposed an improved protocol to remedy these attacks and the previous attacks mentioned by Toorani on the YAK protocol, and the proposed protocol uses a verification mechanism that provides entity authentication and key confirmation. The author showed that the proposed protocol is secure in the proposed formal security model under the gap Diffie‚ÄêHellman assumption and the random oracle assumption. Moreover, the security of the proposed protocol and attacks on the YAK protocol were verified by the Scyther tool.

The Skern Runestone, designated as Danish Runic Inscription 81 or DR 81 in the Rundata catalog, is a Viking Age memorial runestone located in the small village of Skjern, Denmark between Viborg and Randers. The stone features a facial mask and a runic inscription which ends in a curse. A fragment of a second runestone designated as DR 80 was also found in Skjern. Description DR 81 from 1856 drawing. Top of DR 81 from 1856 drawing. This inscription consists of runic text in the younger futhark that circles a facial mask, with text listed as line B located on the top of the stone. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is the oldest classification. This classification is used for inscriptions where the runic bands have straight ends without any attached serpent or beast heads. The facial mask on this stone is a common motif and is found on several other Scandinavian runestones including DR 62 in Sjelle, DR 66 in √Örhus, DR 258 in B√∂sarp, the now-lost DR 286 in Hunnestad, DR 314 in Lund, DR 335 in V√§stra Str√∂, Vg 106 in Lasseg√•rden, S√∂ 86 in √Öby √§gor, S√∂ 112 in Kolunda, S√∂ 167 in Landshammar, S√∂ 367 in Sl√§bro, N√§ 34 in Nasta, U 508 in Gillberga, U 670 in R√∂lunda, U 678 in Skokloster, U 824 in Holms, U 1034 in Tensta, and U 1150 in Bj√∂rklinge, and on the Sjellebro Stone. The Skern Runestone was discovered in 1843 in the foundation of a staircase in the ruins of a local castle dating from the 14th century, which had been razed in 1626 during the Thirty Years War. Before the cultural and historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often re-used in the construction of roads, bridges, walls, and buildings. The inscription has been dated as being carved approximately 1000 C.E. The runic text states that the stone was raised by a woman named Sasger√∞r in memory of √ì√∞ink√°rr √Åsbj«´rnson, who is described in Old Norse as √æan dyra meaning \\"valued\\" or \\"the dear one.\\" The runic text ends in a curse, which is on line B on the top of the stone, and calls anyone who would break the monument a si√æi. This word is translated in Rundata as \\"sorcerer,\\" but actually refers to a \\"sei√∞r worker.\\" During the Viking Age the practice of sei√∞r by men had connotations of unmanliness or effeminacy known as ergi, and aspects of this sorcery ran counter to the male ideal of forthright, open behavior. Other runestones with similar curses include DR 83 in S√∏nder Vinge, DR 209 in Glavendrup, DR 230 from Tryggev√¶lde, DR 338 in Glemminge, and Vg 67 in Saleby. Two of names on the stone have been of interest to scholars. Sasger√∞r is otherwise unknown, but is likely derived from the common name √Åsger√∞r, perhaps as a result of children's speech. p. 586 The runes u√æinkaur are translated as √ì√∞ink√°rr, a theophoric name that refers to the Norse pagan god Odin and a curl of hair, suggesting that the name originally may have referred to cultic initiates who grew long hair. In this connection, it is possible that the drott or lord from the text could refer to Odin, although it is likely that the lord was a king or other person of rank. The name √ì√∞ink√°rr is also used in the inscriptions in a possible cultic reference on DR 4 in Hedeby, DR 133 in Skivum, and DR 239 in G√∏rlev. In addition, it has been suggested that K√°rr is used as the name of a cultic initiate on inscription Vg 56 in K√§llby and the son of a Norse priest on Vg 73 in Synnerby. DR 81 is known locally as the Skjern-sten 2.

She composed works for orchestra, keyboard and voice, and music for opera and ballet, including ballets for performance by the dancer Adeline Gen√©e. Biography Dora Bright was born in Stanton Broom, Sheffield, Yorkshire. Her father was Augustus Bright, a cutlery manufacturer and hardware merchant. He was a grandson of the jeweller and watchmaker Isaac Bright, who had been one of the founders of Sheffield's Jewish community, having settled there c. 1786. Augustus also served as a vice consul for Brazil,\\"Deaths\\", The Standard, 4 November 1880 and as a captain of the Hallamshire Volunteer Rifle Corps. He was an amateur violinist and in 1873 Dora, aged nine, performed alongside him in a benefit concert for his military unit. He died on 1 November 1880, at the age of 50. His business was inherited by his widow, but it failed in 1882. Dora's mother was Katherine Coveney Pitt, an actress, playwright and manager of a theatre company. Also known as Kate Pitt or as Mrs Augustus Bright, she was a daughter of the actors Charles Dibdin Pitt and Ellen Coveney.\\"Naomi's Sin.\\" The Era, 11 May 1879 Charles Dibdin Pitt, who was a son of the dramatist George Dibdin Pitt, was lessee of the Theatre Royal, Sheffield, until his death on 21 February 1866, aged 47,\\"Death of Mr Charles Pitt.\\" The Era, 25 February 1866 and was succeeded as lessee of that theatre by his widow.\\"Advertisements and Notices.\\" The Era, 1 July 1866 Kate Pitt's works included the plays Not False but Fickle, Noblesse Oblige, Bracken Hollow and Naomi's Sin. She adapted another play, Dane's Dyke, from her own novel, Unto the Third and Fourth Generation. In 1881 Dora acted in Dane's Dyke, alongside her mother, at the Theatre Royal.\\"Dane's Dyke.\\" The Era, 27 August 1881. Walter Macfarren While at the Royal Academy of Music during 1881‚Äì89, Bright's teachers included Walter Macfarren and Ebenezer Prout. She was the first woman to receive the Charles Lucas Medal for musical composition, for her Air and Variations for String Quartet in 1888. Her circle of close friends there included fellow students Edward German and his fianc√©e Ethel Boyce. Boyce subsequently partnered her in concert performances of Bright's piano duet Variations on an Original Theme of Sir G. A. Macfarren, named for George Alexander Macfarren, their teacher's brother. In 1889, 1890 and 1892 she made concert tours of Germany, including Dresden, Cologne and Leipzig, with performances of her piano concerto in A minor. In 1892 she married Wyndham Knatchbull (1829‚Äì1900), a captain of the 3rd Dragoon Guards and a great-grandson of Edward Knatchbull, 7th Baronet of Mersham Hatch. Thereafter she lived at Babington House in Babington, Somerset, and became a local leader of charitable amateur productions such as performances of Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. From around 1897, her own piano concert performances tailed off. She changed direction towards composing music for dramatic performances. An early success in this line came in 1903 when The Dancing Girl and the Idol, an oriental fantasy with words by Edith Lyttelton, was given an amateur production at a prestigious charity event in Chatsworth House. In 1904, the piece was performed at Chatsworth again, by royal request, as King Edward had missed the 1903 performance through illness.\\"The King and Queen at Chatsworth.\\" The Times, 7 January 1904. She was also the composer for ballets created with Adeline Gen√©e, in a collaboration which also involved the designer C. Wilhelm. These ballets included The Dryad, La Camargo and La danse. As well as dancing these in London, Gen√©e performed them during her successful tours of America, Australia and New Zealand. Bright's Suite bretonne was performed at the Proms in August 1917. On 8 April 1937 she performed an orchestral piano concert for BBC Radio. On 28 April 1939 the BBC broadcast her playing from her home, Babington House. Around 1940, Bright began to work for the magazine Musical Opinion. Her association with the magazine coincided with a re-directing of its editorial policy onto a sternly reactionary course and a decline in readership. She died at Babington in 1951. Many of her works have not survived.

It features cooperative gameplay for up to two players. Players can unlock new abilities which can be upgraded, and can also unlock new characters to play as. The story revolves around a pair of robots which become stranded on a planet by a race known as the Krofax. As the robots explore the planet they discover an abandoned spaceship. The ship's computer (voiced by Simon Pegg) informs them that they can find the parts necessary to repair the ship scattered throughout the planet. The robots then set off to find the necessary parts in the hopes of escaping the planet. The game received mediocre reception from reviewers, who gave generally high remarks for the presentation of the game, with some commenting on the bright colors of the environment and voice acting by Simon Pegg as points of praise. Gameplay was subject to mixed reception from critics. While some critics enjoyed the simplicity of the combat, others felt it did not engage the player enough to be enjoyable. Negative comments were also directed towards the game's camera system; critics felt that the fixed camera did not allow the freedom of similar platform games. In its first two weeks, Spare Parts moved over 15,000 units. That number increased to over 34,000 units as of year-end 2011. Gameplay Spare Parts is a platform game featuring robots. Spare Parts is a platform game. It features local and online cooperative gameplay, and players can drop in and out on the fly. The game features incentives for cooperative play, such as special moves that can only be executed with two players. The game does not feature an AI companion when playing single player. The game has an average play length of between five and seven hours to complete the game, with approximately ten hours to reach 100% completion. The player characters can be upgraded with different items which enhance abilities or grant new ones, such as x-ray vision, power arms, which allow the character to lift heavy objects, and rocket boots which allow temporary flight. Items acquired can be upgraded via in-game currency found throughout the game. Additionally, during cooperative games players may receive bonuses when certain items are equipped and in use simultaneously. Players will also be tasked with rescuing other robots stranded on the planet. Once found and repaired, players can use these robots to play through the game. Synopsis The story is set around a pair of robots, Mar-T and Chip, who become stranded on a junkyard planet by an alien race known as the Krofax. As they journey they discover an abandoned spacecraft. Con-Rad, the ship's computer, informs the pair that the planet contains enough spare parts to repair the ship, but they are scattered throughout the landscape. The duo then set off to acquire the parts needed to be able to repair it and leave the planet. Mar-T and Chip journey across the planet, rescuing other stranded robots and recovering parts for the craft. Shortly after exiting one of the planet's caves the robots learn from Con-Rad that the Krofax have constructed a surface-to-air laser that will destroy the ship upon takeoff if not disabled. Con-Rad further reveals that the Krofax leader, Lord Krung, wants to capture the spaceship and use Con-Rad's technologies for nefarious purposes. The robotic pair sabotage the laser which fires lethal shot to Lord Krung's cruiser as it explodes. Awakening on the surface of the planet, Krung sets the self-destruct on what remains of his vessel, threatening to destroy the entire planet. Krung is confronted within the remains of his ship. The robotic duo defeat the Krofax leader and disarm the self-destruct. Krung makes an attempt at escape, however he and his minions defeated just outside by Mar-T and Chip. Krung drops the final crucial part for Con-Rad's spacecraft, and the robots return to the ship and begin their escape from the planet. As the vessel begins to leave orbit, Con-Rad detects movement in the hangar bay; Lord Krung survived their recent battle and has stowed away. Mar-T and Chip open the cargo bay doors, depressurizing the cargo bay. The equip their magnetic boots and eject Krung from the ship, victorious. Development and marketing Simon Pegg provides the voice for Con-Rad, the ship's computer. Spare Parts was developed by EA Bright Light and published by Electronic Arts. It was announced June 11, 2010 and subsequently shown three days later at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The ship's computer is voiced by English actor Simon Pegg, known for the lead role in Shaun of the Dead. Pegg cited HAL 9000 from the Space Odyssey series, Mother from the film Alien, and GERTY from the film Moon as inspirations for his character. Of the game's cooperative emphasis, Pegg said during an interview with IGN \\"it's a great exercise in cooperation [...], it's like team building.\\" In an interview with Casualgaming.biz, EA Bright Light's Gary Napper said of the target audience, \\"I like to think that we‚Äôve made a game for everybody. It feels like it‚Äôs a young person's game, but it‚Äôs the sort of game I hope a lot of older players, like myself, will play.\\" Napper cited Ratchet & Clank series as one source of inspiration for the game. He also cited the platform genre in general, adding that he \\"couldn‚Äôt really call out a specific title\\" as the main influence for the game. In his interview with IGN, Simon Pegg commented on the visual influences for the game. He cited Japanese manga and cyberpunk elements and added \\"it's a good representation of contemporary science fiction.\\" The developers placed emphasis on cooperative gameplay, and provided incentives available only when playing cooperatively. In an interview with Destructoid, Gary Napper stated, \\"We didn't want to make it just two players running around and doing the same thing, we want to make it so they can do stuff better.\\" Napper further explained the dynamic in his interview with CasualGaming.biz. \\"There‚Äôs things in the game that you can do, like if you both double jump at the same time, you perform a high-five which gives you a health pack,\\" stated Napper. Napper said that the developers wanted players to work together, so the incentives provided a way to encourage cooperative play. Other examples of cooperative play incentive included puzzles which required a second player. While none of these puzzles were necessary to solve in order to complete a level, bonus items and other robot characters could be unlocked by completing these sequences. On April 13, 2012, Electronic Arts shut down multiplayer services for the game. Reception Spare Parts received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In its first two weeks, Spare Parts moved over 15,000 units. That number increased to 34,000 units as of year-end 2011. Critics were generally favorable of the game's art design and audio. Multiple critics praised the use of comedic actor Simon Pegg. Chris Buffa of RunDLC stated that Pegg's performance \\"gives Spare Parts much needed personality, thanks to often times humorous dialogue.\\" David Collins, reviewer for GameFocus, also gave high marks for Pegg's performance. Collins felt, however, that it was \\"unfortunate that the script work didn‚Äôt use Simon Pegg as well as it could have.\\" He did however give high commentary to the game's visuals. \\"The cartoony art style and vibrant color palette is sure to appeal to all ages,\\" said Collins. GameSpot's Jeremiah Leif Johnson stated the Spare Parts has \\"colorful, lively characters and environments\\" and added \\"Mar-T and Chip have a few endearing animations, the minions ooze with diabolical cuteness, and the world is unfailingly colorful and upbeat.\\" Multiple reviewers expressed frustration with the game's camera system. Specifically, they commented on the set camera angles and the fact that the camera could not be rotated. Some reviewers added that the fixed camera angles often caused problems when playing cooperatively. Kristine Steimer and Colin Moriarty of IGN stated players will \\"end up fighting with your partner for the stubbornly- fixed camera's attention.\\" Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated simply that the camera system in cooperative mode was \\"horrible\\". Gameplay mechanics received mixed commentary from reviewers. Buffa praised the fact that the game has several items for the player to find and collect. He also gave high marks for the various upgrades which can be equipped to the characters. Johnson felt that the game lacked direction in regards to its upgrades and their use in the game environment. \\"[It's] often impossible to figure out which of these tools you need to use next without resorting to help,\\" he noted. Johnson also felt the combat consisted of \\"repetitive button-mashing\\". Collins noted that the although the game allows players to defeat all enemies by \\"[spamming] the basic attack button\\" that each enemy had a weakness which was more susceptible to a specific combat move. Brett Day of 411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 8.5 out of 10 and said, \\"EA has delivered a great game that will keep you coming back for more, as you will want to find everything on the planet. The biggest downfall is the blasted camera, and it will frustrate the fire out of you at times, and will cause you to die needlessly, but overall the game is excellent. If you are looking for a fun game that is great in both 1 player mode and 2 player modes, then you should definitely give Spare Parts a try.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B+ and called it \\"a solid platformer if you're playing solo, but it really shines in multiplayer.\\" However, Roger Hargreaves of Metro gave it a score of five out of ten, saying, \\"Ratchet & Clanks less talented cousins show just how unimportant technical competence is when a game has no heart or ambition.\\" References External links  Category:2011 video games Category:3D platform games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games about robots Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Cooperative video games ","title":"Spare Parts (video game)"},{"id":"29911538","text":"U≈°ka was a medieval ≈æupa (small administrative division) of Serbia in modern- day southeastern Serbia.

Biography Joseph Hathaway Cosby was born on June 2, 1902 in Hampton, Virginia to Joseph Hugh and Harriet Hathaway Cosby. After attending a variety of public schools, he entered Fork Union Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1921. Cosby then attended the University of Richmond, the University of Virginia, and the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, receiving a degree from each college. On September 17, 1924, Cosby married Helen Frances Eubank of Newport News, Virginia. They had one daughter, Jane Cosby. Joseph Cosby was a pastor in Lexington, Virginia when the United States entered World War II. He joined the US Army Chaplain Corps in October 1942 and served until January 1946. Twenty-one months of Cosby's service were spent in the European Theater of Operations. Cosby received six battle stars and achieved the rank of major. After his return to the United States, Cosby served as a pastor in Richmond and Lexington, Virginia. He succeeded Colonel Aubrey H. Camden as President of Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia on July 28, 1951. Cosby became known as Colonel Cosby during this time, since the President is by tradition an honorary colonel if he hasn't achieved that rank or higher in military service. Cosby retired as President at the end of the 1969-1970 year, with then-Dean Vernon T. Lankford being his successor. In 1984, Cosby published a book on Hargrave Military Academy, From Ashes To Excellence, 19501970. The book draws its title from the fire of 1950 and the subsequent rebuilding of the academy. Four thousand copies were printed, costing Hargrave approximately $12,000. Cosby died in Newport News on October 11, 1998, at the age of 96. His wife had predeceased him after 62 years of marriage. Colonel John W. Ripley and an honor guard of nine Hargrave cadets were among those present at his funeral. Legacy Colonel Cosby is well-remembered at Hargrave, where he was President for nineteen years. One of the most important buildings on campus, the Joseph H. Cosby Humanities and Sciences building, is named in his honor.

It consists of thick layers of sandstone, made up of grains of feldspar and quartz from a granitic source rock, interbedded with thin layers of siltstone and shale. Hard, massive, and exceptionally resistant to weathering, it forms the high rocky summits of the Santa Ynez Mountain range north of Santa Barbara, eastward into Ventura County. Type locality, description, and distribution The type locality of the unit is at Matilija Hot Springs, along the Ventura River about northwest of Ojai, near to California State Route 33. At its type locality it is around thick, and consists of both marine and non-marine sandstones with occasional thin beds of micaceous shale separating massive sandstone layers.Donald R. Prothero and Justin R. Britt. \\"Magnetic stratigraphy and tectonic rotation of the Middle Eocene Matilija Sandstone and Cozy Dell Shale, Ventura County, California: implications for sequence stratigraphic correlations.\\" Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 163, Issues 1-4, November 1998, Pages 261-273. The sandstone layers are made up of well-sorted grains of quartz and feldspar. The unit can be found along the crest of the Santa Ynez range all the way from the western extremity of the mountains near Point Arguello, to its type locality north of Ojai, and east and northeast into the Ventura County backcountry, where Piru and Sespe creeks cross through the formation.U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region. Final Environmental Impact Statement. Land Management Plans for Los Angeles National Forest, Cleveland National Forest, Los Padres National Forest, and San Bernardino National Forest. R5-MB-074-B: September 2005. pp. 221, 231, 251. [www.fs.fed.us/r5/scfpr/projects/lmp/docs/feis-v2.pdf Available here] It accounts for the highest peaks in the Santa Ynez range, dipping underneath the younger Coldwater Sandstone, Cozy Dell Shale, and Sespe Formation near San Marcos Pass in the center of the range. The thickness of the unit is widely variable, generally decreasing to the west. In its type locality it is around thick; in the vicinity of La Cumbre Peak it is thick; and while it thins to only thick underneath San Marcos Pass, it thickens again to around at the high summits of Santa Ynez and Broadcast Peaks. It thins westward from there, being only thick at Refugio Pass, and less than 300 in the Santa Rosa Hills and west to Point Conception.Dibblee, Thomas. Geology of Southwestern Santa Barbara County, California. Bulletin 150, California Division of Mines and Geology. San Francisco, 1950. 95 p. Along with the younger Coldwater Formation, the Matilija is the source of the enormous sandstone boulders which are found abundantly along the creeks and shoreline of Santa Barbara and Goleta. Additionally, boulders are strewn on hillsides in the upper Riviera, and elsewhere on hillsides and floodplains. These boulders, none of which can be moved even in the most intense modern-day flood events, tumbled down the mountains during Pleistocene-age storms and mudflows of unimaginable intensity. Boulders of the Matilija were included in the mud and debris flows in the January 2018 Montecito mudflows. The Matilija Sandstone produces little soil when it weathers, and generally supports only hard chaparral on slopes that are not bare rock. North-facing slopes have some stands of pine and fir in the higher elevations. The formation appears in boreholes drilled into oil fields offshore, indicating the formation dips steeply underneath the Santa Barbara Channel. At the Point Conception Oil Field, the Matilija is at least thick, and first appears approximately below ground surface.California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III. Vol. I (1998), Vol. II (1992), Vol. III (1982). PDF file available on CD from www.consrv.ca.gov. p. 674-675 In the Molino Offshore Gas Field, southeast of Gaviota about offshore, the formation is at an average of below the seafloor, and a well drilled to had not reached the bottom of the formation. Deposition environment and tectonic history Sometime in the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago, the landmass containing present-day Santa Barbara County became submerged, allowing sediment deposition offshore. During this time the sea alternately deepened and became shallow again, with the deposition environment supporting either sandstones or shales corresponding to shallow or deep conditions. The Matilija Sandstone dates from the earliest sustained shallow-water episode during this time, the period from 48.5 to 46 million years ago. Additionally, the piece of the crustal block on which the sandstone was deposited has rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise since the time of deposition, moving from a location approximately adjacent to present-day San Diego to the region it occupies in the present day. After reaching its current position along the coast, the entire Santa Ynez Range was uplifted, mostly during the Quaternary period and late Pliocene, by crustal shortening and compression from tectonic forces at the boundary of the Pacific and North American Plates. The Matilija Sandstone and other units, formerly submerged, rose over from their original positions. In some places the forces causing this uplift were so abrupt that sedimentary layers deposited as recently as the Pleistocene are now angled 60 degrees from horizontal. Paleontology While the formation is rich in microfossils, it is considered to be of low paleontologic sensitivity, i.e. larger fossils are unlikely to be encountered. In the Santa Rosa Hills, the unit has yielded numerous shells of molluscs, including bivalves and gastropods. Economic importance As a potential reservoir for oil and gas deposits, the Matilija Sandstone is grouped with the above-lying Cozy Dell Shale and Coldwater Sandstone as the Gaviota-Sacate-Matilija Sandstone Play. The likely source rocks for any petroleum accumulation in the Gaviota-Sacate-Matilija Play are the lower-lying organic-rich shale units, such as the Juncal-Anita Formations.James M. Galloway. \\"Santa Barbara-Ventura Basin Province.\\" (BOEMRE) Structure and Petroleum Geology, Santa Barbara Channel, California, 1998 Pages 63-72, Overview and Issues Section, Pacific Section of AAPG, 97, 102, 112-114. Since this deep-lying play is incompletely explored, with many boreholes not even reaching the Matilija, the estimates for hydrocarbon resources are speculative, with the United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement giving a range of of oil recoverable using current technology for the entire Santa Barbara-Ventura Basin Province. In general, in the eastern and central parts of the basin, the sandstone would be too deeply buried to have reservoir potential. However, the area potentially containing oil and gas is large, including approximately within the Federal Outer Continental Shelf. The largest single hydrocarbon accumulation yet identified in the Matilija Sandstone is in the Molino Offshore Gas Field, discovered in 1983, and contains approximately of oil equivalent.

Despite his family ties, Francisco was never entitled Infante of Spain due to the unequal marriage of his parents, which did not receive approval from Queen Isabella II. Early life and career Francisco de Paula was born at Toulouse, France, the third child of Infante Enrique of Spain (son of Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain and Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies) and his morganatic wife, Elena Mar√≠a de Castellv√≠ y Shelly (1821‚Äì1863), daughter of Antonio de Castellv√≠ y Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Count of Castell√°, and Margarita Shelly y McCarthy. His mother was of Valencian and Irish ancestry. His parents' marriage was not approved by Queen Isabella II, and they were married in secret in Rome. Once they returned to Spain, the couple was exiled to Bayonne, and they later settled in Toulouse. He had three brothers and one sister. His early years were spent between Spain and France. On 12 March 1870, his father challenged Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, to a duel. The duel ended in the shooting and death of his father. His brother Enrique refused to accept the 30,000 pesetas that the Duke of Montepensier offered to pay as compensation for his act. He and his siblings were adopted by their uncle, Francisco de As√≠s.Fuente: La Ilustraci√≥n Espa√±ola y Americana 25.3.1870 pag.94 - Don Enrique de Borb√≥n Like his brothers, Francisco proved to have good military skills. Initially, he joined the Carlist army, but after the restoration of the monarchy, he joined the army of his cousin, Alfonso XII, in 1875. That year, he was appointed brigadier general in the island of Cuba, which at that time was still a colony of Spain. Francisco de Paula was known at the time to claim for himself the erstwhile French throne, after the death in 1883 of the pretender Henri, Count of Chambord. His claim caused numerous headaches for the queen regent, Maria Christina, which resulted in two months of imprisonment for Francisco de Paula in Santo√±a in 1898. In 1927, his cousin Alfonso XIII awarded him the Order of the Golden Fleece. Marriage and family In Havana, he met his first wife, Mar√≠a Luisa de La Torre y Bassave (1856‚Äì1887), daughter of Jos√© Maria de La Torre y Armenteros, a wealthy Cuban landowner. They married in Havana on 15 September 1882 but settled in Madrid, where four of their five children were born. They had five children: *Elena de Borb√≥n y de la Torre (18 September 1878 ‚Äì 24 September 1936), married in 1908 to Jos√© de Oltra y Fullana, had issue.

The case was silenced by the will of his cousin Alfonso XIII. They had issue. *Mar√≠a de los Dolores de Borb√≥n y de la Torre (25 May 1887 ‚Äì 28 January 1985), died unmarried. After the death of Mar√≠a Luisa in 1887, Francisco de Paula married secondly on 15 February 1890 in Madrid to Felisa de Le√≥n y Navarro de Balboa, from a noble family and also a native of Cuba. They had three children: *Enrique Mar√≠a de Borb√≥n y de Le√≥n (6 July 1891 ‚Äì 29 October 1936), Marquis de Balboa, married in 1917 to Isabel de Esteban y Iranzo, Countess de Estaban, had issue.

Later years After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, Francisco de Paula was able to stay in Spain, and he continued to reside in Madrid. However, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he had to seek asylum at the Embassy of Chile in Madrid.

Whorls are moderately embracing, whorl section oval and somewhat compressed. The outer whorl may be costate or have rows of nodes, or both. The suture is ammonitic with a wide bifurcated ventral lobe and two lateral lobes on either side. Taxonomic relation Hyatt and Smith (1905, p. 115)included Gymnites in the Gymnitidae along with Ophiceras, Flemingites, and Xenaspis, genera since assigned elsewhere, and included the Gymnitidae in the suborder Ceratitoidea (now the superfamily Ceratitaceae). Smith (1932, p. 30) shows Gymenites derived from Xenaspis and giving rise to the Pinacoceratidae. The American Treatise (Part L, 1957) also includes Gymnites in the Gymnitidae, along with mainly descendant forms such as Buddhaites, Japonites, and variations on Gymnites itself, but instead included the Gymnitidae in the Pinacocerataceae which is consistent with Smith's derivation of the Pinacoceratidae from Gymnites. Distribution Fossils of species within this genus have been found in the Triassic of Afghanistan, Canada, China, Hungary, Iran, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, United States.

Reublin was born in 1484 in Rottenburg am Neckar. In 1521, after studying theology in Freiburg and T√ºbingen, Reublin became the pastor at St. Alban in Basel and began to advocate reform. St. Alban was soon the center of the evangelical movement in Basel. In the Fall of 1522 Reublin was expelled from the city for his Reformation sermons and moved to Witikon in 1524, where he became the local pastor and preached against infant baptism. Reublin was with Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz in Z√ºrich in January 1525 at the birth of the Anabaptist movement. Reublin took part in a disputation on 17 January 1525 after which Grebel, Mantz and Reublin were given eight days to leave the canton. Reublin proceeded to Hallau, with John Br√∂tli, who had been in the region of Schaffhausen since 1521. They soon established a large Anabaptist congregation there. From Hallau Reublin successfully evangelized in other areas for the young Anabaptist movement. On Easter 1525 he baptized the theologian Balthasar Hubmaier in Waldshut, where another center of the Anabaptism was developing. Later Michael Sattler was baptized by Reublin in Rottenburg. Other places evangelized by Reublin include Schaffhausen, Strasbourg, Reutlingen and Esslingen. After an arrest in Strasbourg in the Winter of 1528‚Äì29, Reublin wandered with other Swiss Brethren to Auspitz in Moravia where the first farms of the Hutterites were established. After a dispute over the sharing of personal resources and money Reublin was banned from the local community and returned to southwest Germany in 1531, where he was again evangelizing in Rottenburg. Sometime later he left the Anabaptist movement. Around 1535 Reublin was in correspondence with the Reformed theologian Heinrich Bullinger. In August 1554 Reublin appears once in Basel. Little is known about his last years. Further reading * James M. Stayer: Wilhelm Reublin. Eine pikareske Wanderung durch das fr√ºhe T√§ufertum.

Hammann was the trusted adviser of Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow. Hammann always kept an attentive eye upon public opinion as reflected or created in the press.

He was dismissed from the CIA in 1950 after an arrest a few years earlier brought his homosexuality to the attention of Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Lavender scare that saw a purge of the State Department personnel because of charges of homosexuality. Early life Offie was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, one of seven children in a family of Italian immigrants from Caserta.Morgan, 209 His father worked as a railroad hand.Hersh, 42 He worked his way through business college. He entered government service as a stenographer at the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington, D.C.Brownell and Billings, 149 State Department career Offie began his State Department career at the American embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, where he was posted from October 1931 to April 1934.State Department Register, vol. ?, p. ? He arrived in Moscow on June 11, 1934, to serve as secretary to Ambassador William C. Bullitt. Bullitt promoted him to vice-consul in 1934. His duties went beyond secretarial tasks to those of personal assistant, companion, and \\"all-purpose troubleshooter,\\" even accompanying Bullitt on vacation and managing his medications.Brownell and Billings, 182, 204, 235, 262Thomas, 34 Offie also corresponded with Bullitt's State Department superiors and FDR's secretary Missy LeHand to report on Bullitt's health and work habits.Brownell and Billings, 176, 211 New York Times reporter C.L. Sulzberger on a visit to Moscow found Offie dealing in fine furs, the sort of special activity Offie became known for in the Foreign Service.Powers, 60-1 He followed Bullitt when he became Ambassador to France in 1936.Brownell and Billings, 260-1 Work included social obligations, as when he entertained the young John F. Kennedy and his school chum Lem Billings in 1937. Later on their European tour, the pair bought a dachshund puppy they named Offie.Perret, 61 Offie entertained Kennedy again as he passed through Paris in 1939. Kennedy wrote to Billings: \\"Offie and I are now the greatest of pals and he really is a pretty good guy, though I suppose that it will make you a bit ill to hear it.\\"Hamilton, 259; Morgan 210 Offie complained that Kennedy took liberties reading embassy papers without authorization. Kennedy, for his part, joked about having to humor Offie: \\"Offie has just rung for me, so I guess I have to get the old paper ready and go in and wipe his arse.\\"Dallek, 56-7 On another occasion Offie played bridge with the Duchess of Windsor.Morgan, 210 Bullitt and Offie left Paris two weeks after the Germans took the city in June 1940. Later that year, when Bullitt had left France and not yet received another diplomatic assignment, Offie reported on Bullitt's frame of mind to Jane Ickes, wife of Bullitt's close friend, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, and succeeded in getting the Secretary to raise the question of Bullitt's status with the president himself.Brownell and Billings, 270 He had enemies as well and the nickname \\"Carmie Awful.\\" In 1941, Bullitt allowed Offie to accept a short-term appointment as third secretary to Anthony Biddle when he was named to represent the U.S. to countries occupied by the Germans.Brownell and Billings, 272-3 In 1942, when Bullitt was facing financial difficulties, he lived with Offie, who had returned to Washington and had real estate investments there. Bullitt told a friend that \\"Offie had sponged off him for many years, and now he was sponging of Offie.\\"Brownell and Billings, 285-6 Offie next followed Bullitt to the Navy Department. Bullitt was known to be too talkative to be trusted with sensitive information about military plans. Offie had one incident that showed similar lack of discretion. Emerging from the American Embassy in London, he was heard to say \\"Well, it's set for November.\\" He was seized by security agents and released after embassy officials and Bullitt argued on his behalf.Brownell and Billings, 288 Washington, D.C., police arrested Offie in 1943 and charged him with \\"disorderly conduct.\\"Brownell and Billings, 298Dean 104 He had solicited an undercover police officer in Lafayette Park across from the White House.Johnson, p. ? With the knowledge of Secretary of State Cordell Hull, the State Department provided Offie with a cover story in the form of a note asserting that Offie had planned a rendezvous with a confidential source as part of his official duties.Morgan, 211 Offie served in Europe during the final years of World War II, beginning first in March 1944 as an aide to Robert Murphy, the State Department's civilian representative to Allied military commanders in Italy and later following Murphy to an assignment in Germany.Brownell and Billings, 304-5; Morgan 211 He was appointed to the staff of George Atcheson, Jr., the State Department's political adviser to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, head of the American occupation of Japan, but the appointment was rescinded before he ever served in that position.New York Times: \\"Liaison is Planned,\\" September 21, 1945, accessed December 5, 2010; for recision see State Department Register, vol. ?, p. ? Offie became known for his ability to entertain while providing such luxurious and hard-to-obtain fare as Russian caviar. In 1947 State Department inspectors discovered that he had used diplomatic pouch for private purposes, moving $3,000 in cash to Paris. The shipment of cash was actually a favor for a friend, his former employer Anthony Biddle, who was trying to send money to his former wife.Morgan, 211-2; Hersh, 245. Biddle's former wife was Margaret Thompson Schulze Biddle.Wilford, 58 As punishment, he was forbidden all further promotion. He resigned from the State Department in April 1948.Morgan, 212 CIA career Based on recommendations from Chip Bohlen, he returned to government service in September 1948 as deputy to Frank Wisner, head of the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), a CIA-funded unit within the State DepartmentDiamond, 94, 306-7 that was responsible for psychological warfare, propaganda, and surreptitious funding designed to destabilize the Soviet Union and its allies.Brownell and Billings, 297-8Thomas, 32 He was widely recognized for his work ethic, rising in the early morning hours to speak to Eastern European contacts, and for an extraordinary ability to process multiple streams of information, digesting complex documents while conducting telephone negotiations. He continued to ingratiate himself with superiors, helping find a cook for Wisner and laying out funds to bring two servants to the U.S. for George F. Kennan.Thomas, 34-5 He was a regular attendee at Georgetown dinners.Riebling, 117 He counted among his enemies Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., a prominent CIA operative in the Middle East, who described Offie years later as \\"an oily little jerk who talked oddly and did odd things.\\"Thomas, 108-9 Offie's value both in occupied Europe and in the CIA related in part to his ability to establish friendly relations with the wives of prominent officials.Riebling, 33 His European connections helped him later in aiding the movement of anticommunists in and out of Eastern Europe. He ran two key programs: Operation Paperclip, which recruited German scientists for work in the United States, and Operation Bloodstone, which targeted the Soviet Union by making intelligence analysts or spies of former Nazis and Nazi collaborators.Gerolymatos, 126-7 He \\"helped to establish the paradigm for harnessing the services of Nazis, fascists, and collaborators, and a variety of emigre groups and desperate volunteers from the DP camps in America's fight against the specter of world communism.\\"Gerolymatos, 131 From Germany he recruited former diplomats and military officers to help spy on and support American propaganda efforts against the Soviets, a program codenamed Operation Bloodstone. Like others in the CIA at the time, he ignored the Nazi past of some of them, including such notables as Gustav Hilger, who had links to the creation of the SS Einsatzgruppen massacre squads, and Nicholas Poppe, a Russian linguist and Nazi collaborator who helped plan the extermination of the Jews.Thomas, 34-5, 356n6, available online here. Thomas writes: [Poppe] had worked for the Ost-Assen Institute in Czechoslovakia during the war, doing research on the \\"Jewish Problem...in order to perfect the Nazi killing machines\\", quoting the work of Kevin Ruffner of the CIA History Staff. His other responsibilities included the oversight of labor and √©migr√© affairs, as well as the National Committee for Free Europe, parent of Radio Free Europe, which began radio broadcasts into Czechoslovakia in 1950 using a transmitter Offie borrowed from the U.S. Army.Thomas, 61Weiner, 537 In October 1949 Offie made sexual advances in his OPC office while meeting with another government employee, an agent in the Army Counterintelligence Corps, who filed a report of the incident. Instead of a confrontation with Offie and his superiors, CIA security staff or enemies within the OPC accomplished his removal in a roundabout way. Early in 1950, they leaked information about Offie's 1943 arrest to Senator Joseph McCarthy. When McCarthy testified on March 18 before a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigating his claims about Communists working for the government, he described the case of a \\"convicted homosexual\\" who had resigned from the State Department in 1948 and now held a \\"top-salaried important position\\" at the CIA. He raised the case again in the same setting on April 25, 1950, adding details about \\"the men's room in Lafayette Park,\\" asking subcommittee chairman Senator Millard E. Tydings why he had not seen to the man's dismissal. That same afternoon, another subcommittee member, Senator Kenneth S. Wherry, a McCarthy supporter, announced that the employee in question had resigned.Morgan 212-2, provides a persuasive, detailed account. Other accounts differ on details: Dean, 105; Riebling, 117; Brownell and Billings, 298 Inside the CIA, Offie had defended himself as beyond blackmail, willing to admit his homosexuality, and Wisner defended him. CIA Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter yielded to Wisner until public disclosure seemed inevitable and he forced Offie's resignation in May 1950. Later career In June 1950, Wisner arranged a less sensitive position for Offie at the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC), a labor foreign policy group of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union secretly supported with CIA funding.Wilford, 53, 59, 64, 66 He was greeted warmly by his superior, longtime labor activist Jay Lovestone. His title was Director of International Labor Information Services, but he served principally as liaison between the CIA and the FTUC, exploiting sources at his former employer to help his new colleagues understand and maneuver through the CIA's financing processes, though the relationship between the two organizations remained difficult.Morgan, 214-25 Offie's contract at the FTUC ended in June 1952. He had developed detailed knowledge of the workings of the Mutual Security Administration, successor to the Marshall Plan, which managed purchases from European companies on behalf of the U.S. government. He used that expertise first as a consultant to a Washington law firm, while continuing to consult for the FTUC, and then to establish his own business, Global Enterprises.Morgan, 225-6 In August 1953 Offie visited the Majorca home of Charles W. Thayer, a diplomat forced from the State Department as part of the Lavender Scare.Dean, 143 Personal life Historians agree that Offie was a homosexual, describing him variously as \\"open\\" or \\"flamboyant.\\"Thomas, 34, Weiner, 537 John F. Kennedy referred to him as \\"La Belle Offlet\\" in 1939, suggesting his effeminacy was obvious.Hamilton, 258 In a 1986 interview, a former OPC official dismissed the FBI's belief that Offie was a Soviet agent: \\"How could the Soviets blackmail him? Everyone in Washington knew he was a homosexual!\\"Aarons and Loftus, 269, 351n8 In an interview with conservative columnist Westbrook Pegler at the end of 1952, Offie explained the 1943 Lafayette Park incident as an attempt to destroy him because of his long and vigorous anti-Communist record. He said he had a rendezvous there on State Department business and was accosted by a small gang. When he woke in a police cell he paid his $25 fine just to end the incident.Sarasota Herald-Tribune: Westbrook Pegler, \\"More on Interview with Carmel Offie,\\" January 29, 1953, accessed December 5, 2010. Pegler reported Offie's arrest and explanation several times, along with his account of American funding of European leftists. J. Edgar Hoover's reaction to Offie's interview with Pegler was: \\"It seems to be an inherent part of a pervert's makeup to be also a pathological liar.\\"Morgan, 231 Ever since McCarthy's attacks highlighted Offie's homosexuality, Hoover's FBI had maintained a file on Offie and occasionally kept him under surveillance. Two of his professional contacts were also highly suspect in Hoover's eyes, Bullitt who had once been pro-Soviet though he had changed his mind decades earlier, and Lovestone, a former Communist turned Labor activist which Hoover did not recognize as a fundamental change of ideology. At one point Offie had to defend himself to FBI agents and explain how, while working as a private citizen, he knew details of the government's planned procurements in Italy for 1953. He explained his source, but Hoover remained personally interested in his case.Morgan, 230-1 Offie died on June 18, 1972, when British European Airways Flight 548 crashed soon after take-off from London Heathrow Airport.Morgan, 231-2; New York Times: Alvin Shuster, \\"All 118 Killed in Worst British Air Crash,\\" June 19, 1972, accessed December 5, 2010 He is buried in Washington's Rock Creek Cemetery.

In 1886 there were about 20 Jewish families in town.Bertha Goldenberg, letter to The Sabbath Visitor, Cincinnati, Vol. 16, No. 3? (June? 1886); p. 127. The Ottumwa Jewish cemetery, founded by the Ottumwa Hebrew Association in 1876, was the lasting legacy of this period of Ottumwa's history.Henrietta Szold, ed., Ottumwa, American Jewish Yearbook 5668, Jewish Publication Society, 1907; p. 180. Edna Ferber lived in Ottumwa as a child in the 1890s. Her father operated The Fair, an Ottumwa department store. At the time, Ottumwa was a coal mining town, and the antisemitism of the town had a lasting influence on Ferber. She wrote of her years in Ottumwa: \\"I don't think that there was a day when I wasn't called a sheeny.\\"Eileen H. Watts, Avery, Edna Ferber, Jewish American Writer: Who Knew? in Modern Jewish Writers in America, Evelyn Gross Avery, ed., 2007; pp. 41‚Äì42.Michael W. Lemberger and Leigh Michaels, Ottumwa, Arcadia, 2007; p. 40. By the turn of the 20th century, Ottumwa had fewer than 50 Jewish families, immigrants from Germany and across eastern Europe. Most were \\"in the junk and second-hand business\\", but there were also laborers, shoemakers, tailors and one prominent merchant. Some families were extremely observant, \\"wearing two types of phylacteries\\", while others believed \\"in no Judaism at all.\\" One local Jew had a personal Torah scroll and a private mikvah, but there was no organized community.Simon Glazer, Ottumwa, The Jews in Iowa, Koch Brothers, Des Moines, 1904; pp. 314‚Äì315. In the early 1900s, many people called the area around the 300, 400 and 500 blocks of Main Street \\"Jew Town\\" because the stores in the neighborhood were mostly owned by Jewish families, many of whom lived above their stores. The B'nai Jacob congregation was organized in 1898. In 1907, the congregation was located at 404 E. Main St., and had 15 members out of an estimated Jewish population of 150. The Hebrew school had 15 pupils and met once per week. By 1919, the Jewish population of Ottumwa had risen to 412 and the congregation had moved one block into the current building. The school still only had one teacher on staff, but there were 21 pupils and the school met daily.Harry Schneiderman, ed., Ottumwa, American Jewish Yearbook 5680 vol. 21., Jewish Publication Society, 1919; p. 374. The B'nai Jacob congregation numbered around 250 in the 1930s and 1940s. The synagogue affiliated with the Conservative movement in the 1950s. The Jewish population of Ottumwa was 231 in 1951.Morris Fine, ed., Jewish Population Estimates, American Jewish Yearbook, Vol. 52, Jewish Publication Society of America, 1951; p. 18. By 1960, the Jewish population was estimated at 175,Erich Rosenthal, \\"Studies of Jewish Intermarriage in the United States\\", in the American Jewish Yearbook, Vol. 64, American Jewish Committee, 1963; p. 35. and by 1962, 150.Morris Fine and Milton Himmelfarb, Eds., Appendix American Jewish Yearbook, Vol. 64, American Jewish Committee; p. 71. For the next two decades, through 1983, the population estimate remained unchanged.Martha Jelenko, Morris Fine and Milton Hillelfarb, eds., Appendix, American Jewish Yearbook, Vol. 74, Jewish Publication Society, 1973; p. 311.Martha Jelenko, Morris Fine and Milton Hillelfarb, eds., Appendix, American Jewish Yearbook, Vol. 76, American Jewish Committee, 1976; p. 234.Milton Hillelfarb and David Singer, eds., Appendix, American Jewish Yearbook, Vol. 84, American Jewish Committee, 1984; p. 168. By 2010, the congregation on a typical Saturday morning had shrunk to seven or so, and by 2018, as few as two. In August of that year, the congregation donated its Torah scroll \\"to a new synagogue forming in South America\\", and ceased functioning.Milner, Matt (June 17, 2019). \\"Performing arts festival celebrates new home\\", Ottumwa Courier.  Building  The sanctuary as seen from the North corner, with the Torah ark at the left, the reader's desk in the center, and the women's balcony at the upper right. As originally built, the bimah was centered below the chandelier. B'nai Jacob's Renaissance or Deco Vernacular synagogue building at 529 East Main Street (at Union Street) was constructed in 1915. The architect was George M. Kerns and L.T. Chrisman and Company was the contractor. The exterior is brick, with an addition in the back holding a kitchen and social hall, built some time in the 1950s. As originally built, the bimah was in the center of the sanctuary, but in an earlier modernization of the building, the central bimah was removed. The woodwork around the Torah ark is original, as is the 7-branched menorah in front of the ark. The ark doors and interior, however, are not original. The sanctuary features a woman's gallery against the south-west wall, built over the front entrance foyer and classroom, although it is rarely used. In traditional Judaism, women were seated separately from men, separated by a mechitza which frequently took the form of a balcony. The separation of men and women at B'nai Jacob ended when one woman's health problems prevented her from climbing the stairs to the balcony. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 10, 2004 (reference number 4000815), and underwent major historic restoration in 2004‚Äì2005. In February 2019 the building was donated to the American Gothic Performing Arts Festival and renamed Temple of Creative Arts, to be used as meeting and performance space.

It is an international supplier of bird seed. The Keytee brand supports a non-profit foundation dedicated to raising awareness of pet care and environmental conservation. History Nicholas W. Knauf and Peter Juckem founded a grain elevator on East Main Street in Chilton in 1866. William N. Knauf at age 19 became co owner with Frank Tesch (K & T) when Nicholas W. Knauf died. They took the company name from their initials. They built a gristmill and general store to sell seed to farmers. They used the 1872 railroad to ship barley and oats to markets; that led to selling barley to Milwaukee breweries. In 1920, the company became a national supplier of peas to be used for pigeon feed. It expanded into making feed for birds and other small animals, becoming the first commercial supplier of wild bird seed in 1955. William Engler Sr., long- term employee and son-in-law of William N. Knauf, purchased the company in 1964 and renamed it Kaytee Products, Inc. His son, Bill Engler Jr., took over the company in 1982. Bill Engler Jr. was named the Small Business Person of the Year in 1993 by United States President Bill Clinton. As of 1993, Kaytee had 365 employees and annual sales of about $70 million. At that time, it also held about 1300 exotic bird species in an aviary in Chilton. Engler sold the company to Central Garden & Pet in 1997. They renamed the company Central Avian & Small Animal and continued to market products under the Kaytee brand. Controversy In April 2012, Kaytee recalled five lots of parrot handfeeding formula due to excessive vitamin D. On May 12, 2012, several types of mouse, rat, and hamster food was recalled for possible salmonella contamination. There are anecdotal reports online of animals perishing. In February 2013, Kaytee recalled a number of treat mixes due to reports from their parsley supplier of salmonella contamination. No salmonella was found in the actual treat mixes, but to comply with FDA regulations, they recalled all mixes containing that parsley. Kaytee Preferred Birds branding raised and provided young birds to many pet store chains in the US, such as Petsmart . Oklahoma State places externs with Kaytee Preferred Birds .

Oil on mahogany, transferred from another panel. National Gallery, London. The Magdalen Reading is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century oil-on-panel altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The panel, originally oak, was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the National Gallery, London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period.Panofsky pp. 258‚Äì9 (writing before the painting had been cleaned of its overpaint): \\"Soon after the completion of the 'Descent from the Cross,' that is to say, in 1436‚Äì1437, Roger would seem to have produced two works in which the youthful feminine types of the Escorial picture, still vaguely Fl√©mallesque, appear refined to greater spirituality: a major composition, apparently a Virgo inter Virgines, of which only a fragment, the 'Magdalen Reading' in the National Gallery at London, survives; and the beautiful \\"Madonna Duran\\" or \\"Madonna in Red\\" in the Prado\\". She is identifiable as the Magdalen from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the Magdalen was conflated with both Mary of Bethany who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil, is also relevant. and the unnamed \\"sinner\\" of . Iconography of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted. The background of the painting had been overpainted with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, which shows the head of Saint Joseph, while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be Saint Catherine of Alexandria, is thought to be from the same larger work.\\"The Magdalen Reading\\".

The drawing shows that The Magdalen occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of The Magdalen, which measures . Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. The Magdalen Reading can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the National Gallery, London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian Lorne Campbell as \\"one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works.\\"Campbell (1998), 405 Description Detail showing the face and veil of Mary Magdalene painted in pure whites. The eyebrows and eyelids have been plucked in accordance with conventional ideals of beauty at the time.Turudich (2004), 198 Mary Magdalene as depicted in early Renaissance painting is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on Mary of Bethany, who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and \\"listened to His Word\\", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister Martha who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve.Jones (2011), 54 Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a chemise of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript \\"looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible\\" and is \\"clearly a devotional text\\".Campbell (1998), 395‚Äì396, 398; quotes 396, 398. It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.Belloli (2001), 58 Van der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings. She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden sideboard. By her feet is her usual attribute of an alabaster jar; in the Gospels she brought spices to the tomb of Jesus.Campbell (1998),398; and . Another passage, taken in the Middle Ages to refer to the Magdalene, is the source of the alabaster jar. The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an archer atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.Potterton (1977), 54 Detail showing the prayer book, likely a book of hours, decorated with white cloth and gold clasps. Van der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master Robert Campin or his workshop. It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of Saint Barbara in Campin's Werl Altarpiece,Clark (1960), 45 and also the Virgin in an Annunciation attributed to Campin in Brussels.Campbell (1998), 400; the Merode Altarpiece is another version of this composition, though the Virgin's figure there is less similar. Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white.Salih (2002), 130 Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue sash, while the gold brocade of her underskirt is adorned by a jewelled hem. Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a \\"fallen woman\\" is hinted at by the nap in the fur lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil. Darwent wrote, \\"Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't.\\"Darwent, Charles. \\"Rogier van der Weyden: Master of Passions, Museum Leuven, Belgium\\". The Independent, 27 September 2009. Retrieved 1 January 2011. In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as Memling and Matsys often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she \\"is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in The Magdalen Reading by Rogier van der Weyden\\".Crispin (2008), 157 Detail showing the jar and row of nails on the timber floor at the lower right corner of the panel. Note the attention paid to the gilded clasp and fall of the shadow. The level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as \\"far exceed[ing]\\" van Eyck. Her lips are painted with a shades of vermilion, white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of impasto, grid and dots of varying colour and size.Campbell (1998), 402 Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary. The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal rosary beads have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with Jan van Eyck. Lorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as \\"small miracles of painting\\", and says that \\"the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding\\". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position.Campbell (1998), 396 and 402 Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and \\"much too narrow and papery in effect\\". A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases.These objects are often cut off in reproduction. The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small pitcher, possibly a reliquary. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.Ward (1971), 35 Altarpiece fragment Head of Saint Joseph (fragment). . Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon. This panel is thought to show Saint Joseph, whose body is visible to his upper arm in The Magdalen Reading. Virgin and Child with Saints,Campbell (2004), 49 a drawing in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum, is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden,Campbell (1998), 398‚Äì400 who possibly may have been the Master of the Coburger Rundbl√§tter. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint John the Baptist; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as John the Evangelist. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes. This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work. Head of a Female Saint (Saint Catherine?) (fragment). . Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon. A possible representation of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, it is of lower quality than the other two known fragments, indicating that it was probably completed by members of van der Weyden's workshop. At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces,Campbell (1998), 394, 398 possibly due to damage, although The Magdalen fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail \\"it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings\\". From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1 m high by 1.5 m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. This size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period. The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of L√©o Lardus in Suresnes, France. The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist. Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear rosary beads in one handJoseph's beads closely resemble those in the Arnolfini Portrait, which was painted around the same time and is on permanent display in the National Gallery alongside The Magdalen Reading. See Jones, 46, 54 and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon shows the head of a figure believed to be the Saint Joseph; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel. Davies, Martin (1937), 140, 142‚Äì145 The reasons for the overpainting and the breaking up of the altarpiece are unknown. There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at Suresnes. The figure may represent Saint Catherine of Alexandria, and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling.Campell (2009), 49 In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel. Some art historians, including Martin Davies and John Ward,Davies and Ward have published, in 1957 and 1971 respectively, diagrammatic reconstructions of the altarpiece based on evidence available of the time. Campbell is responsible for much of the scholarship since. have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is chamfered. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3 cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures , the Saint Joseph .Ward (1971), 32 Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is \\"obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the Magdalen\\", it \\"seems likely\\" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that \\"about half way up the right edge of this fragment [\\"Catherine\\"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke ... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist\\". The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes. The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward‚Äîwhich combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints‚Äîis widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the verso shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a Brussels workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.Campbell (1998), 398‚Äì400, illustrating the drawing, and with a drawing of a full reconstruction. Iconography Descent from the Cross, c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of Mary of Clopas.Campbell (2004), 34 Van der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany,Described as \\"This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair\\". identified by the time of Pope Gregory I as the repentant prostitute of .McNamara (1994), 24 She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a male gaze), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer. Writing in \\"The Crying Face\\", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a \\"pictorial formula for crying\\".Barasch (1987), 23 Annunciation, attributed to Robert Campin, Brussels, c. 1427‚Äì1432, where the figure of the Virgin is close to van der Weyden's London Magdalen. By the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes.Green (2007), 10‚Äì12, 119 Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news‚Äîa witness‚Äîand hence directly associated with the text.Jagodzinski (1999), 136‚Äì137 The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance. Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.Badir (2007), 212 According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in Sainte-Baume and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance.Bolton (2009), 174 By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and \\"borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth\\".Maisch (1998), 48 The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.Ross (1996), 170 She signified the \\"sacrament of anointing (Chrism and Unction)\\" by pouring precious spikenard on Christ's feet at his tomb.Apostolos-Cappadona (2005), 215 Dating and provenance The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives \\"before 1438\\".\\"Rogier van der Weyden\\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 24 May 2011. Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by Robert Campin. He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's Werl Altarpiece.Ward (1971), 28 Because van der Weyden, like most of the early Netherlandish painters, was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin Miraflores Altarpiece continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved,Campbell (2004), 7, 126, 127 or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain. The Magdalen Reading can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in Haarlem,Campbell; Stock (2009), 441 when the work was already cut down. The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem.Campbell (2004), 50 After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin in Paris, whose \\"small but choice\\" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the National Gallery, London by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1860; an acquisition that also included two Robert Campin portraits and panels by Simon Marmion (1425‚Äì1489).Borchert (2005), 203Campbell (1998), 13‚Äì14, 394 This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery. Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955.Campbell (1998), 394, with photo on 395 In general the \\"painted surface is in very good condition\\", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.Campbell (1998), 394 The Magdalen Reading was transferred from its original oak to a mahogany panel (West Indian swietenia)Campbell (1998), 395 by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was \\"Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860\\", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery. Artificial ultramarine-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830.Campbell (1997), 85 The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels.Campbell (1998), 398 The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin.Bjurstr√∂m (1985), 166 It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts in 1918. Gallery File:Madonna and Child with Saints Master of the Koberger.JPG|The Stockholm drawing, attributed to the Master of the Coburger Rundbl√§tter, likely shows the portion of the altarpiece to the left of the Magdalen. The kneeling figure to the far right is probably Saint John the Evangelist, some of whose red drapery can be seen in the London fragment.Ward (1971), 27 Mary's position on the lower right hand corner (out of view) is guessed at by Ward from van der Weyden's positioning of similar figures in other works.Ward (1971), 29 File:Rogier van der Weyden - Reconstructie met Maria Magdalena leest, Jozef en Catharina - van een verloren schilderij.jpg|Reconstruction of a lost painting with Catherine, Josef and Magdalena.

Early life and career  Robert John Tainsh Bell was born to the Rev. George Bell and Margaret Walker Scott in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland, on 15 January 1876. The family moving to Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Bell was educated at Hamilton Academy from which he matriculated at the University of Glasgow, having won a high placement in the university‚Äôs Open Bursary Competition. Bell graduated in 1898 as M.A. (with First Class Honours) in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Appointed a William Ewing Fellow, Bell continued at the university as a tutorial assistant and in 1901 was promoted to junior assistant.Royal Society of Edinburgh Year Book 1966, pp. 10‚Äì11. Obituary Professor Robert J. T. Bell. In 1902 he married Agnes Thomson.Former Fellows of the Royal Society at Edinburgh  Later career  In 1911 Bell was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics and awarded a D.Sc. by the university for his treatise on the geometry of three dimensions, published in book form in 1910 as An Elementary Treatise on Co-ordinate Geometry of Three Dimensions. An instant success, this textbook was to be translated into other languages, including Japanese and three of the languages of the Indian sub-continent. The textbook ran to a third edition (1944) and, from 1938, chapters 1‚Äì9 were issued separately as Co-ordinate Solid Geometry. It has since been reprinted (BiblioBazaar, 2009.) In March 1899 Bell had become a member of Edinburgh Mathematical Society and from 1911‚Äì1920 he served as editor of the Society‚Äôs journal, the Proceedings, during which time he also contributed papers such as Note on the axes of a normal section of the enveloping cylinder of a conchoid, presented to the Society‚Äôs meeting of 9 January 1914. On 6 March 1916, Bell was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers being George Alexander Gibson, Professor of Mathematics, Glasgow; the physicist Andrew Gray, Professor of Natural Philosophy, Glasgow; Robert Alexander Houstoun, and Diarmid Noel Paton, Regius Professor of Physiology, Glasgow (and eldest son of the artist Sir Joseph Noel Paton.) In 1920 Bell was appointed Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. At Otago he joined another former pupil of Hamilton Academy and near contemporary, the physicist Robert Jack who had also gone on to graduate from Glasgow M.A. with Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and who had also been awarded a D.Sc. from Glasgow. Robert Jack had arrived at Otago six years before Bell, in 1914, taking up the appointment as Professor of Physics. Like Robert Jack, Robert Bell went on to serve also as Chairman of the university‚Äôs Professorial Board and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science. (Bell also held the positions as a representative member on the Academic Board of the University of New Zealand and on the University of New Zealand Senate from 1939 to 1946.)

The bill was introduced in October 1975 by United States Congressman Jim Oberstar and was a source of major controversy and debate. Topics of major concern were logging, mining, the use of snowmobiles and motorboats. After much debate, the Act was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 21, 1978. The main purpose of the law is to protect, preserve, and enhance the lakes, waterways and forested areas of the BWCA to enhance public enjoyment of the unique landscape and wildlife. It also intends to establish some form of management to maintain the area and places restrictions on logging, mining, and the use of motorized vehicles.  Background   Selke Committee  Serious concerns about destruction of the BWCA began to surface in the spring of 1964 when a group of people from the Twin Cities, Minnesota, known as the Conservation Affiliates, asked the United States Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman to stop logging and the use of motor vehicles in the Boundary Waters. On May 21, 1964, Secretary Freeman announced that he had appointed a Boundary Waters Canoe Area review committee, chaired by George A. Selke. Other members of this committee included Wayne Olson, Minnesota's conservation commissioner; Rollie Johnson, news director from WCCO-TV; and David J. Winton, chairman of the board of Winton Lumber Company. They reported their findings on December 15, 1964. They recommended that logging be banned in more parts of the area and more regulations be imposed on motorboat and snowmobile use. Secretary Freeman accepted the report and decided to allow a one-year period for public comment due to the controversy surrounding the issues.  Wilderness Act of 1964  President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Wilderness Act in 1964 The U.S. Congress passed the Wilderness Act on September 3, 1964. This new law made the Boundary Waters Canoe Area part of the new National Wilderness Preservation System and became an \\"instant wilderness.\\" However, the act left much of the management, specifically in regards to logging and motorboat use, in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture. The BWCA was the only area with such major exceptions in management policy.  Freeman Directive  On December 15, 1965, Secretary Freeman issued his directive implementing the recommendations of the Wilderness Act and the Selke committee. The Freeman Directive increased the no-cutting zones where logging is banned by immediately and designated an additional to be added in 1975 after the logging contracts in that area expired. This increased the total no-cutting zone to by 1975. Motorboats were still allowed on over half of the water area and snowmobiles were allowed on designated routes. The Freeman Directive governed the management of the BWCA for the next 13 years. This order created two zones, an Interior Zone where commercial timber harvesting is banned, and a Portal Zone, where timber may be harvested except for areas within of lakes or streams suitable for watercraft and portages which connect these waterways. This decision was implemented to maintain and preserve the beautiful scenery of the area and to avoid the pristine waters from gathering pollution. Several areas of virgin forests that had been untouched by the logging industry were added to the Interior zone with this directive. The most notable examples are the area between Loon Lake and Lake Agnes as well as the area northwest of Cherokee Lake. of virgin forest were still left in the Portal Zone and were vulnerable to logging. Logging trials  Historic logging in northern Minnesota. On November 24, 1972, the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG) filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Minneapolis, which became known as MPIRG v. Butz. The suit sought a court order which would require logging companies to file an environmental impact statement (EIS) before renewing contracts under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The MPIRG also requested that logging in virgin forests be suspended until the environmental impact statement is completed. On April 16, 1973, Judge Miles Lord stated that seven timber contracts did harvest trees from virgin forests which would require an EIS under the NEPA. He issued an injunction against logging on these areas until completion of an EIS. In his opinion, the Wilderness Act of 1964 did not permit logging in the virgin forests of the BWCA. After the EIS was released in August 1974, the MPIRG filed a second lawsuit along with the Sierra Club as a coplaintiff. They claimed that logging in virgin tracts of land was a violation of the Wilderness Act and they wished to permanently ban logging. Judge Lord issued a temporary injunction until the start of the trial on November 4, 1974. Judge Lord issued his final decision for MPIRG and Sierra Club v. Butz et al. on August 13, 1975. For the most part, he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. He found that timber cutting within blocks of virgin forests violated the intent of the Wilderness Act and was illegal. Also, the United States Forest Service was no longer allowed to conduct sales.  Legislative history  Donald Fraser On October 24, 1975, Representative Jim Oberstar introduced bill H.R. 10247 which would resolve the BWCA lawsuits. His bill split the area into two parts. Some would be given full wilderness status, while the remaining would be declared a National Recreation Area and still be open to logging and use by motorized vehicles. This bill was strongly opposed by environmentalists Among the largest group of opposition was the pro-wilderness Friends of the Boundary Waters, led by Kevin Proescholdt. Representative Oberstar explained his position in a 1977 news conference, \\"My view is that we ought to have protection, but more intensified, more broad-based recreational use of the BWCA, plus some very limited commercial timber harvesting in the second growth areas of the BWCA.\\" About one year later, Representative Donald Fraser introduced H.R. 14576 in the U.S. House of Representatives. This bill would give wilderness status to all of the BWCA and would end logging, motorized vehicles, and mining. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Judge Lord's logging decision on August 30, 1976. The logging injunctions were lifted by December of the same year. At the same time, Representative Oberstar worked with several large lumber companies with the Forest Service acting as a mediator to suspend cutting for six months while Congress could examine the issue without further damage to the environment and external pressure. In order to resolve issues between the two bills, a U.S. House subcommittee on national parks and recreation held two field hearings in July 1977 in Minnesota. The first took place in a State Capitol hearing room filled to capacity in St. Paul, Minnesota. Notable wilderness supporters which were present included State Rep. Willard Munger. The hollowing hearing took place the next day in the northern town of Ely on the edge of the BWCA. Both supporters of the logging industry and environmentalists came out in large numbers to show their support. Environmentalist Sigurd Olson spoke of the need to protect the Boundary Waters. After the hearings, another bill was drafted and unveiled in March 1978, this time sponsored by California's Phillip Burton, chair of the Interior's National Parks and Insular Affairs subcommittee, and Minnesota Representative Bruce Vento. This bill called for the complete termination of logging. This bill stalled until negotiations took place between Ely City Attorney Ron Walls and environmental attorney Chuck Dayton. The final measure became known as the Dayton-Walls agreement. On October 15, 1978 in the final hours of the Ninety-fifth Congress, the House and the Senate passed the revised version of H.R. 12250. The bill was signed on October 21, 1978 by President Jimmy Carter.  Provisions  The BWCA Wilderness Act officially changed the name of the over one million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of land known as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Over were added to the wilderness, which brought the total area to . This Act also instated regulations for many debated topics which were brought about by the Wilderness Act of 1964. Although the area may look nearly the same as it did prior to 1978, it is currently much quieter and mostly free of motorized vehicles.  Motorboat restrictions  The use of motorboats in the wilderness was highly controversial, as they caused noise and environmental pollution. As a result, one of the first provisions of the Act was to prohibit the use of motorboats in the wilderness, as well as in lakes which border the wilderness, effective January 1, 1978. It restricted motorboats to 24% of the water surface area of the BWCA. Lakes with motorboat access are typically large lakes served by either access roads or mechanical portages.  25 horsepower limit  Two canoes paddling into the sunrise on Saganaga Lake. However, there are numerous exceptions to these restrictions. Motorboats with motors no greater than may be used on the following lakes: *Trout Lake *Fall Lake *Moose Lake *Newfound Lake *Sucker Lake *Newton Lake *South Farm Lake *East Bearskin Lake *Snowbank Lake *Saganaga Lake east of American Point *Basswood Lake (except portion northwest of Washington Island and north of Jackfish Bay) This limit does not apply to towboats used to transport canoes on the lakes of Moose, Newfound, Sucker, and Saganaga until January 1, 1984. Birch Lake and the portion north of Jackfish Bay in Basswood Lake have a limit only until January 1, 1984.  10 horsepower limit  Motorboats with motors no greater than ten horsepower are to be permitted on the following lakes and river: A group of young canoeists at a campsite on Iron Lake in the BWCA. *Sea Gull Lake east of Three mile Island *Clearwater Lake * North Fowl Lake *South Fowl Lake *Island River east of Lake Isabella *Alder Lake *Canoe Lake Certain lakes are limited to until a specified date. These lakes include: Basswood River to and including Crooked Lake in Saint Louis and Lake Counties until January 1, 1984, Carp Lake, the Knife River and Knife Lake in Lake County until January 1, 1984, Sea Gull Lake, the portion generally west of Threemile Island until January 1, 1999, and Brule Lake in Cook County until January 1, 1994.  No horsepower limit  The Act designated the following lakes as being free of the horsepower limit: *Little Vermilion Lake *Loon River *Loon Lake *Lac La Croix south of Snow Bay and east of Wilkins Bay  Snowmobile restrictions  A typical snowmobile in a snowy landscape Snowmobiles were also considered by many visitors to be destructive and noisy. Therefore, this Act prohibited the use of snowmobiles in all areas of the wilderness except for the following: the overland portages from Crane Lake to Little Vermilion Lake in Canada, and from Sea Gull River along the eastern portion of Saganaga Lake to Canada. Snowmobiles may be used on Vermilion Lake portage to and including Trout Lake, Moose Lake to and including Saganaga Lake via Ensign, Vera and Knife Lakes, and East Bearskin Lake to and including Pine Lake via Alder Lake and Canoe Lake until January 1, 1984. Snowmobiles must be less than in width.  Logging restrictions  The Act stated that the Secretary of Agriculture must terminate all timber sale contracts in the BWCA within one year of its passage. The logging in virgin forests was to terminate immediately. The one year termination period allows contracts to expire and for the logging companies to take corrective steps to clean up and restore tracts of timber which were harvested heavily. The U.S. government paid compensation for any timber contracts terminated or modified by this Act.  Mining restrictions  Mining became restricted in the BWCA and the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to acquire mineral rights in the Wilderness and along three road corridors in a Mining Protection Area. Quotas The Act also established quotas for daytime use of motorboats on the lakes where they are permitted. Cabin owners, resorts, and their guests are exempt on their own lakes. The quotas are based on criteria such as the size and configuration of each lake. The quotas may not exceed the annual average actual annual motorboat use of the calendar years 1976, 1977, and 1978 for each lake and must take into account fluctuations in use during different seasons. Amendments Although the BWCA Wilderness Act was never officially amended, several attempts were made between 1979 and 1982 by the state of Minnesota. All of these were eventually upheld by the 8th District Court. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to review this opinion in 1982.

Organizational history Division had been mounting between the regular organization, controlled by Edwin J. Brown, and the left opposition centered on Hermon F. Titus' Seattle Socialist. The \\"rights\\" were more electorally oriented while the \\"lefts\\" wanted to make the party a \\"fighting organization\\", and tried to give aid to the IWW. The faction fight became more acrimonious as the two groups began expelling each other from local branches. The issue was framed in terms of what social group would control the party: the rights were pictured as \\"petty-bourgeois\\" and supported by intellectuals, skilled workers and better off farmers while the left was supposedly more \\"proletarian\\" and supported by lumber workers, city laborers and poor farmers. Titus also had supporters in California, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.William Z. Foster, Pages from a Worker's Life. New York, International Publishers, 1936; pp. 31-32. The divisions within the group came to a head at the Socialist state convention in Everett in early 1909. The lefts claimed that they had won a majority of delegates but that the rights had manipulated control of the party apparatus to give them a majority at the convention. Titus and his forces led a walk out and held their own convention, declaring themselves the true representatives of the Socialist Party of Washington. When the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party came down in favor of the regular group, the Titus forces were in an anomalous situation. After flirting with the idea of going into the Socialist Labor Party, the Titus- led Socialist Party of Washington became the Wage Workers Party on February 25, 1910.Foster, Pages from a Worker's Life, pp. 32-33, 36-37. When the party was formed they made a constitutional provision banning petty-bourgeois elements from the organization, including \\"lawyers, preachers, doctors, dentists, detective, soldiers, factory owners, and shop keepers\\" from membership. Titus, who had been a doctor, gave up his profession and became an elevator operator. Joseph Biscay was elected secretary. Harry Ault, later to become a leader in the Seattle General Strike of 1919 was a member, as was William Z. Foster and his future son-in-law Joseph Manley.Foster, Pages from a Worker's Life, pp. 37-38. The organization lasted a matter of months. It produced one issue of a newspaper, The Wage Worker. Titus' supporters in Oregon and California were confused about the situation and apparently never rallied to the new group. Most of the group's members drifted into the Industrial Workers of the World, while the core around Titus split between factions advocating a four and a three-hour day.

Often associated with being founded by Sunjata Keita, the history of Mali is extremely based on oral history. The story of the founder of Mali, Sunjata Keita, is largely based on oral history. Oral history may be defined as the preservation and interpretation of historical, cultural or personal experiences by way of a speaker. In Mali, such a speaker can be described as a poet, a storyteller, a praise singer or a musician. A large amount of Mali‚Äôs history is transferred via oral historians. Such oral historians in Mali are known as griots, Jalis, and Jelis. The origins of oral history in Mali may be traced back to the story of Sunjata Keita. Modern-day oral history in Mali has transformed from the history based griots to a more contemporary musical and negotiator based griots. The current state of oral history in Mali has travelled to other realms like popular culture and politics. What is a griot? One cannot become a Griot; one must be born into a family of griots to hold that position. Sometimes, a key aspect to signify who is a griot can be found in the last name. Jeliyas are similar to griots but are not born into a griot family. Jeliya described as the \\"art of the griot\\" refers to a type of \\"musical and verbal artist\\".\\"Jeliya- The Art of Jeli (Griot)\\". Jelis have an \\"exclusive right to play the kora\\". Jelis are similar to griots because they also recount history but the jelis role is to \\"Sing and recount Mande social and political life\\". In reference to a griot, griots are only supposed to marry other griots. Like jelis, griots in Mali often use instruments and music to recite history which ultimately renders the history a performance and not just a story.Ryan Skinner discusses griots (and other matters) in an interview with Peter Shea Oral history in the Mali Empire In the Mali Empire, an evident example of oral history is the Sunjata Keita or Sundiata Keita story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong representation of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history can be traced back to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata‚Äôs griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of Sunjata writes: Suso‚Äôs story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata‚Äôs father died, like other parts of his father‚Äôs estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father‚Äôs estate as well. The Sunjata story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, ‚ÄúI want no part of it [father‚Äôs property] except the griots‚Äù.Suso, p. 127. Sunjata‚Äôs need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as undividable. In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to or rather ‚Äúchosen‚Äù for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso‚Äôs version of the Sunjata story says: ‚ÄúWe [griots] will not abandon him‚Äù.Suso, p. 133. In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In Sunjata, Sunjata‚Äôs griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso‚Äôs version of Sunjata, Bala Faaseega Kuyate accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes: \\"A day will come When bush fowls will lay their eggs on the site of your deserted town. He says here is your gold.‚Äô When he had done that, Sunjata buried his mother; Then he and Nyakhaleng Juma Suukho, And his younger brother, And Bala Faaseega Kuyate Rose up and went. When he and Bala Faaseega Kuyate were on their way, They had gone far into the bush, And they had been travelling for a long time when Bala said, ‚ÄòI Am terribly hungry.‚Äô Sunjata said, ‚ÄòWait here.‚Äô He went into a clump of thick bush, He examined the calf of his leg where there was plenty of flesh and he cut some off. When he had cut it into thin strips, he cooked it, Then he pounded the leaves of a medicinal shrub and then tied up his leg, He came back, And he said to Bala, ‚ÄòHere is some meat‚Äô\\".Suso, pp. 432-451. The relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they ‚Äúwork‚Äù for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village. Not only were griots used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the villages, but oral historians and griots are also an important cultural facet in Mali in terms of language. Because oral history, is exactly as the name describes, a means of passing history verbally, language is also passed on by oral historians. Skills of oral historians in modern Mali In present-day Mali, oral historians / griots are sometimes seen as ‚Äúintermediaries‚Äù between two parties. Oral historians in modern Mali often act as mediators between those from different political parties. Jan Jansen in The Griot‚Äôs Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy discusses the role and skills of oral historians in modern-day Mali: He writes about ‚Äúbeing sent‚Äù as a strategy for modern-day griots. Similarly to griots during the Mali Empire, modern-day griots must also pass messages between different parties. The skill of ‚Äúbeing sent‚Äù allows for ‚Äúnegotiation‚Äù to occur between parties that may not have negotiated without the help of griots. The oral historians understand that their role does not merely rest on capturing and narrating history, but their role goes as far as encompassing negotiator between two different parties with distinct ideals. Oral historians in modern-day Mali provide a source of communication between such parties. Not only do oral historians chronicle history but they also create a means to communicate. Once the ‚Äúnegotiator‚Äù / oral historian completes his goal of mediating tensions between the different parties, the parties are able to have a ‚Äúreconciliation festivity,‚Äù the griots position as both a negotiator and historian are exemplified. Throughout Western Africa and Africa as a continent, oral historians act as mediators between conflicting parties. Oral historians are often essential to solve certain problems. Jansen‚Äôs work provides a detailed account of other skills that oral historians / griots need in modern-day Mali. Jansen describes a griot‚Äôs skills as a means to ‚Äúmaster and manipulate the processes of ‚Äòheating‚Äô and ‚Äòcooling down‚Äô social situations‚Äù.Jansen, p. 42. Some of the skills that Jansen describes are: # Don‚Äôt [initially] let the parties meet # Don‚Äôt [initially] allow parties to talk directly to each other # Repetitive talking # Slowing down of negotiations Because oral historians in modern Mali are often used as negotiators, the above stated skills ease the process of solving problems between the different political parties. Oral historians in modern Mali acting as negotiators do not allow the parties to meet until the problem at hand is solved. The reasoning behind not allowing the parties to initially meet acts as a way to ease the anger members of the conflicting parties may feel toward each other. Jansen writes: ‚Äú[a member of a conflicting party] must never express his opinions to the person he is in conflict with since this person will die of anger‚Äù.Jansen, p. 43. It is the job of the griot to keep both parties separate to eliminate the chance of this anger occurring. Similarly to the reason why the griot does not allow both parties to meet initially, the griot does not allow both parties to meet as a means to eliminate tensions that can occur if both parties were to meet. The skill of repetitive talking that Jansen lists is used for ‚Äúserious matters‚Äù.Jansen, p. 44. Jansen writes: \\"Serious matters are not left to only one person to communicate. A small group is created in order to communicate the message. The messenger asks a member of the group to transmit a certain message to the person to whom the message is directed. The message is then transmitted from person to person until it reaches its destination.\\" The repetitive talking of oral history transforms the message being passed into a ‚Äúsupra-personal phenomenon‚Äù and allows the message to ‚Äúgain a semblance of authority‚Äù. Likewise, the repetitive nature of oral history transforms messages and creates similar yet slightly different versions of historical events. Jansen describes ‚Äúslowing down negotiations‚Äù as essential to appease both sides of conflicting parties.Jansen, p. 45. Jansen‚Äôs presentation of griots in modern Mali as messengers depicts the transformation of oral historians over time. During the Mali Empire, oral historians often were limited to working with a specific family or emperor but in current Mali, oral historians are no longer limited but can act as messengers between various political parties or other groups. Modern-day relations between griots and nobles in Mali The relationship between griots and nobles may appear to be a difficult one to understand. As seen through the relationship described between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate, the noble and griot relationship is sometimes represented as a partnership. Dr. Barbara G. Hoffman, an associate professor of Anthropology at Cleveland State University, discusses in her book Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande the relationship between griots and nobles. She writes that ‚Äútension is often expressed through nobles‚Äô criticism of griots‚Äô ‚Äúempty speech‚Äù or griots‚Äô disdain for nobles lack of self-knowledge‚Äù.Hoffman, Barbara (2000). Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande. Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 53. While griots take pride in understanding themselves and life around them, nobles are often more focused on worldly aspects. Despite the relationship that is suggested in Sunjata, the relationship between nobles and griots can be seen as extremely different from that of loyalty and partnership. Hoffman views the relationship between griots and nobles as showing a sharp distinction between castes. Hoffman writes, ‚ÄúThis [the caste system] was a central issue for the griots and nobles present at this Kita celebration. They generated social difference and the reinforcement of social boundaries through a repertoire of strategies for recreating old social structures as well as for creating new ones‚Äù. In modern Mali, griots are often seen as being a part of a lower caste then nobles despite the help and history they provide to nobles and society. In Hoffman's work addresses the position of oral historians in castes \\"Mande- style\\".Hoffman, p. 251. Hoffman writes, \\"Living up to one's caste ideals is a source of pride in Mande; violating them a cause for disgrace.\\" The position of griots in the Mande caste system was that of extremely lower stature then the nobles griots and oral historians have a tendency to work for. Oral historians molded their way into the caste system and although they are of a lower caste then nobles, they are extremely influential in Mali. In Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande, David C. Conrad also discusses the relationship between nobles and griots, writing: \\"Another revealing aspect of the relationship between nobles and griots is the asymmetry of their mutual accountability. For example, nobles almost never blame individual griots for the general character of the group\\".Conrad, David C. (1995). Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande. Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 29. Conrad then goes on to describe how griots \\"openly criticize nobles in public as well as in private\\". Although griots are seen as being inferior to nobles, griots have no issue criticizing the faults of the family they work for. Such a willingness to criticize emphasizes the fact that griots do have in Mali despite their position in the caste system. Also included in Conrad's book is Cherif Keita's essay \\"Jaliya in the Modern World: A Tribute to Banzumana Sissoko and Massa Makan Diabate\\", in which Cherif Keita presents a \\"tribute to contemporary bards\\".Conrad, p. 16. Keita praises the griots and claims that griots \\"have contributed positively to toward the building of a modern nation-state\\". Contrary to beliefs that griots were seen as a part of a lower class, Keita presents an \\"aristocratic view of contemporary griots\\". Keita's perspective on griots provides a different outlook on the position of griots in modern Mali. Although griots are looked at as being a part of a low caste, griots have added to cultural and historical modern Mali society. Popular modern-day griots in Mali In modern-day Mali, griots are often singers or musicians. For example, Abdoulaye Diabat√©, a singer from Mali, was born into a family of griots in 1956. Diabat√© has a plethora of experience in contemporary and popular music. Baba Sissoko is also considered a Malian griot because he was born into a family of griots. Another griot from Mali, Toumani Diabat√©, also has a plethora of experience in other forms of performing. Toumani Diabat√© has experience in flamenco, blues and jazz.

From c.1979 to 2016, the Signal was owned by Savannah, Georgia-based Morris Multimedia, who sold it to Paladin Multi-Media Group. The current owners are Richard and Chris Budman, who purchased Paladin in June 2018. The sale attracted controversy because the couple had frequently espoused rightwing conspiracy theories and engaged in incendiary fringe rhetoric. The Signal covers the five communities that eventually became Santa Clarita, about northwest of downtown Los Angeles. By 2018, it was the only newspaper serving the city. History Morris Multimedia, based in Savannah, Georgia and led by chairman Charles H. Morris, owned the Signal for thirty-seven years. In January 2016, Morris Multimedia sold The Signal to Paladin Multimedia Group. Charles F. Champion, the Signal new president and publisher, said he wanted to \\"build on the paper's award winning news platform\\", attract more local advertisements and a \\"wider audience\\". At that time the forty \\"editorial, advertising sales, circulation, digital and production departments\\" staff members retained their jobs. Champion's business partners were Gary Sproule, Russ Briley and Ken DePaola. As reported by Business Wire, Paladin purchased the Signal in \\"an era of personalized news consumption\\" when \\"community newspapers are more influential than ever. They represent the confluence of technology and content at a hyper local level.\\" Champion said that, \\"We need to be the area's first resource for news and commerce...That means we have to be insightful reporters as well community advocates.\\" In June 2018, Richard and his wife Chris Budman purchased the Signal Santa Clarita-based parent company Paladin Multimedia Group in an equity purchase. Richard Budman, who had been the Signal publisher under Morris Media from 2004 to 2007, and his wife Chris Budman, purchased the Signal in June 2018. Tim Whyte, who had worked with Budman as the Signal general manager until 2007, returned as editor-in-chief in 2018. Whyte writes all the editorials for the daily. In 2018, along with the five-day edition, the Signal began to publish a new Sunday magazine with free distribution to 75,000 households, featuring a \\"bylined column\\" entitled \\"Black and Whyte\\" by Whyte. Controversy According to an October 9, 2018 article in the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR), concerns have been raised that under new management, the Signals editorials, opinion pieces, articles and omissions, have been a polarizing factor in SCV. Budman denies these allegations. According to a July 24, 2018 article in The Daily Beast, \\"After the Budmans bought the paper, Santa Clarita Valley residents combed the couple‚Äôs social media accounts and found the right-wing conspiracies along with Chris declaring her intention to actively promote the Republican Party in the valley.\\" References External links Paladin Multimedia Group Category:Newspapers published in California Category:Santa Clarita, California ","title":"The Santa Clarita Valley Signal"},{"id":"29914580","text":"The Dafali (Shekh Hashmi) and Mujawar are a Muslim community found all over India, with the majority being in the state of Uttar Pradesh surname Darvesh They are general types of Muslim community.

Overview In digital transmission schemes, including cellular telephony systems such as GSM, a certain percentage of received data will be detected as containing errors, and will be discarded. The likelihood that a particular bit will be detected as erroneous is the bit error rate. The RBER characterizes the likelihood that a given bit will be erroneous but will not be detected as such Applications When digital communication systems are being designed, the maximum acceptable residual bit error rate can be used, along with other quality metrics, to calculate the minimum acceptable signal to noise ratio in the system.

The ranch was founded by William Potts in the 1870s, and would remain in the Potts family until 1944 when the property was sold to Harvey Sewell and O. G. Bates. The Potts' spread, which was recognized as one of the finest cattle outfits in the state at the time, eventually came to include other properties, including the Butler, Morgan Creek, and Wilson ranches. With Belmont, the nearest established community, being 37 miles away, a number of other ranches developing in Monitor Valley, and several small mining camps springing up on the eastern flank of the Toquima Range, the need developed for more localized postal facilities. The ranch was originally granted a post office in 1893, however the grant was rescinded before the office became operational. The grant was re-extended in 1898 and the post office, with various members of the Potts family acting as postmasters, operated from August 12, 1898 until October 31, 1941. The old ranch house, while somewhat dilapidated, is still standing at the location. Hot springs located near the site are popular destinations for hot spring enthusiasts and are maintained well enough for modest recreational use.

Toronto Argonauts Wilder signed with the Toronto Argonauts on March 14, 2017, reuniting head coach Marc Trestman with the family, as Trestman was a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant coach when Wilder's father was a running back on the team. Following an injury to starting running back Brandon Whittaker, Wilder made his first professional start on July 24, 2017 against the Ottawa Redblacks. Wilder took over the starting running back role in September, earning consecutive player of week honors in weeks 13 and 14, gaining 257 and 218 yards from scrimmage in each game, respectively.

In late January 2018 Wilder announced that he was planning to sit out of the Argos' 2018 season in the hopes of pursuing a return to the NFL in 2019. Wilder noted that his current contract of $56,000 (around US$45,000) in 2018, combined with the risk of career ending injury, does not give his family comfort about the future were he to play in 2018. The Argonauts issued a statement in response to Wilder's comments, stating their expectations of him to fulfill his contractual agreement with the organization. Failure to report to the team in due course will likely result in him being placed on the team's suspended list for his decision as per his contractual commitments with the organization. By February 27, 2018 the Argos had reportedly offered Wilder a contract extension which would make him one of the highest-paid running backs in the league. On March 3, 2018 the Argos and Wilder agreed to a two-year contract extension, keeping him in Toronto through the 2019 season. The deal is reportedly worth $100,000 per year, with no signing bonus. Wilder played in the first 13 games of the season for the Argos, before suffering a leg injury in Week 16. Wilder, who began the 2019 season as the Argos' starting running back, was listed as a healthy-scratch by the Argos during the team's August 16, 2019 loss to the Eskimos: The loss pushed the Argos record to 1‚Äì7. He finished the 2019 season playing in 14 games, rushing 92 times for 464 yards and one touchdown and catching 47 passes for 415 receiving yards and four touchdowns.

Cano was discovered by Diego Rivera, who helped Cano as a youth enter the prestigious San Carlos Academy and then employed him as an assistant with the mural work being done at the Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City. Cano painted his first solo mural in 1953, and since then has produced paintings, murals, sculptures, photography, book illustrations and more, including creating a high relief technique with a cement base. However, Cano is best known for his mural work which depicts and promotes the Totonac culture, and much of his work can be seen in his hometown, including a monumental sculpture of a Volador dancer overlooking the city. Cano also worked as an academic for over 36 years, recently retiring, but he continues to work as an artist based in Xalapa. Preparation Cano was born in the small city of Papantla, Veracruz in 1932, and began drawing at a young age. When Diego Rivera was in Papantla in 1945, Cano had a chance to meet the famous painter and show him some of his work. Impressed, Rivera had the 14-year-old Cano come to Mexico City and work at his home as a personal assistant. However, this only lasted four months until Rivera decided that the young man needed formal training. He contacted then-governor of Veracruz Adolfo Ruiz Cortines to get a scholarship for Cano at the prestigious San Carlos Academy. Cano attended the institution from 1947 to 1951 and graduated with honors. After graduation, he went back to work with Diego Rivera and Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, who were working on murals at the recently constructed Ciudad Universitaria. Cano worked assisting both between 1949 and 1950. He mostly assisted with the works located on the Olympic stadium, the main library and the Faculty of Sciences buildings. Career In 1953, he painted his first solo mural at the XEPR station, called ‚ÄúHistoria del Petr√≥leo‚Äù (History of Petroleum). Soon after, he painted ‚ÄúPapantla y sus Educadores‚Äù at a primary school in his hometown. During the rest of the 1950s, he painted murals in various parts of Veracruz including ‚ÄúHistoria de Tuxpan y Homenaje al Maestro‚Äù in Tuxpan, ‚ÄúServicio Social‚Äù in Poza Rica, ‚ÄúP√©rgola‚Äù in Coatzintla, ‚ÄúPapantla‚Äù in the same city and ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù in Poza Rica. In the 1960s, he mostly did canvas work with expositions in the north of Veracruz. He painted one mural called ‚ÄúHistoria de Mexico‚Äù in Poza Rica. His most prolific period was the 1970s, painting and sculpting numerous works in Veracruz, and as a teacher supervised many more works done by students as part of a muralist movement in rural areas of Veracruz, Campeche, Yucat√°n, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Sinaloa and Colima . In 1985, he created his most important work called ‚ÄúHistoria de la Educaci√≥n Federal at the Xalapa delegation of the Secretariat of Public Education. Also during the 1980s, he sculpted a number of works including a monument to the Ni√±os H√©roes in Coyutla and the monumental sculpture of a Volador dancer in Papantla. The 1990s were mostly devoted to mural work including ‚ÄúHistoria de la Medicina‚Äù in Xalapa, ‚ÄúLa Justicia‚Äù in Xalapa and ‚ÄúMis Raices in the Metro Bellas Artes in Mexico City. In the 2000s, he created works in various media including murals, sculpted murals and sculptures. During his entire career, he has had numerous showing of his non mural/monumental works in the states of Veracruz, Aguascalientes, Mexico City and abroad in San Francisco and Japan . Book illustrations include ‚ÄúCuentos para ser contados‚Äù in 1985, ‚ÄúECCE PEUR‚Äù in 1986, ‚ÄúCantares Huastecos y otros Ensayos‚Äù in 1991, ‚ÄúBrisas Huastecas‚Äù in 1996 and ‚ÄúMemoria del Totonacapan‚Äù in 1999. Cano has worked in painting, sculpting, etching, drawing, book illustrations and photography, but he is best known for his mural work, especially for work related to and promoting his native Totonac culture.(rincones15) . He is the creator of a high relief mural technique which used reinforced concrete as its base. While Cano‚Äôs work can be found in both Mexico and abroad, most of Cano‚Äôs work are found in Veracruz state, with over sixty murals alone in the state, and in Mexico City. (rincones15) His work can be found in many places in his native Papantla, from the monumental sculpture of a Volador atop a mountain overlooking the city to large murals such as ‚ÄúHomenaje a la Cultura Totonaca,‚Äù which describes the history of Papantla from the pre-Hispanic era to the present day. It was created by Cano along with sculptors Rivera Diaz, Contreras Garcia and Vidal Espejel in 1979, measuring 84 meters long and four meters wide. In an interview in 2007, Cano stated that he considers his work to be instructive, meant for those with little knowledge of the arts, focusing on happy elements such as dance. This is in contrast with much of modern art, he says, which can turn off many who see it for the first time. In addition to his artistic career, Cano has had an academic career, mostly associated with the Universidad Veracruzana (UV) in Poza Rica. In 1960, he founded the Escuela de Pintura in conjunction with the Secretariat of Public Education in Poza Rica. He cofounded and directed the Escuela de Artesanias (Schools of Handcrafts and Folk Art) in Coatepec . In 1969, he began with UV and would retire from the institution 36 years later. He began as the director of the Taller Libre de Arte in Poza Rica, and ten years later, he founded the Talleres Libres de Arte de Papantla, associated with UV. This latter institution has trained hundreds of young artists in various specialties. In 1988, he became the director of the Casa de Cultura (Cultural Center) of Papantla, a position he currently maintains. Since graduating from the San Carlos Academy, Cano has received numerous awards for his artistic and academic work. The most recent include, one from a business group in Poza Rica in 2005, one from a petroleum workers union and one from the Universidad Veracruzana in 2006 and the ‚ÄúAdolfo Ruiz Cortinez‚Äù Medal awarded by the Veracruz state government in 2007. He is also one of few artists in Mexico to have had a museum dedicated to his works while still alive. While retired from academia, Cano continues his artistic career based in Xalapa, Veracruz. In 2010, he exhibited a photographic collection along with conferences about vanilla, a flower and seed pod native to Papantla which has given it the nickname of ‚ÄúLa Ciudad que Perfuma al Mundo‚Äù (The City that Perfumes the World) .

On the world map the location of the village comes at 31‚Äô24‚Äô16.19‚Äô‚ÄôN and 73‚Äô44‚Äô54.62‚Äô‚ÄôE (Google Maps). Kali Bair word refers to a black hackberry tree which is usually not black. Kali means Black and Bair means hackberry or nettle tree. Arabic word for Bair is Sidrah. There was a black hackberry (Bair) tree here which is rare to find in any area. That‚Äôs why the place started to be known by that very tree. Formerly it had been in the jurisdiction of Sheikhupura district, however during the presidential period of Pervez Musharraf, Nankana Sahib was promoted from Tehsil level to a district. Now the village has been announced to be the part of the municipal corporation. History Kareem Tabassum, Nanak Say Nankana, Kitab Mehal, P.102 In the 19th century here at this place was living only one clan which is called Waseer (in the current Nankana Sahib District). They had more than 700 acres of land in their possession. A Hindu cast Khatri also lived in the area as it has been populated by Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus before the Partition of India. In the late 19th century another clan (Bhatti) came there with their cattle and families. They were on the run as they had been convicted of murder in their native village Shamkay Bhatiyan (in Lahore district). They purchased some land from the already living there Waseer community. Thus was constituted most of the present form of the village with two major clans, Wasseers and Bhattis ‚Äì though Bhattis are now more in number than Waseers. File:kalibair.jpg|People preparing ALAM for Kali Bair graveyard. File:Bottom of the Alam.jpg|The bottom of Alam erected at Kalibair Graveyard. Major clans There are two major clansClan, Online Etimology Dictionary in the village, ‚ÄúBhatti clan‚Äù and ‚ÄúWaseer clan‚Äù. They are in majority. However, certain other clans also complement the population of the village. ‚ÄúSyed‚Äù, ‚ÄúAwan‚Äù, ‚ÄúKharal‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnsaari‚Äù, \\"Rehmani\\", \\"Deendaar\\", \\"Cheembay\\" and ‚ÄúMuslim Shiekh‚Äù clans are present there too, even though they are much less in number if compared to the major clans. Most of them live in harmony with each other. The village has often witnessed certain fights among different communities or within a same community, however the ratio of peace and compassion is much higher in the village in comparison to the neighbouring villages in the area. Sectarian division Five decades ago almost all the village related to Hanfi sect or \\"Ahlay Sunnat\\". However, one person from the \\"Ansari\\" clan went to get religious knowledge and when he returned he had chosen \\"Ahl-e-Hadith\\" sect. He became the priest at the village mosque and he started telling people to adopt the sect he had adopted. Within a short span of time he gathered some people form Bhatti, Awan and Rehmani clans as his followers. Along with these two sects there came Syeds after migrating from Indian Kashmir. They were \\"Shia\\". A family from Waseer clan was attracted to Ahmadiyya sect. So now at the moment there live in the village people following \\"Ahl-e-Sunnat\\", \\"Ahl-e- Hadith\\", \\"Shia\\" and Ahmadies preachings. Land The village officially owns 700 acres of land. Until last four decades most of the land was futile. Today almost all the land has been turned cultivatable with the help of fertilizers, modern agricultural machinery and people‚Äôs ever increasing desire for cultivating more and more land. Along with this officially declared land, some of which is in the possession of the people from other villages, the farmers acquire cultivatable lands on lease at various other places too. The number of acres taken on lease varies from year to year. The average of leased land in the last five years comes to 400 acres annually which is increasing with every passing year. Education Education ratio in the village compared to the rest of the region is quite appreciable. Almost more than half of the population of the village is educated and bears much interest in intellectual debate and controversy. However the next generation in the village is quite better. Almost ninety percent of the children attend school and their parents show much dedication in providing them Higher education also. In the village there are more than ten people having passed Master's degree in various subjects, twenty people with a graduation and professional degree and quite a lot above matriculation. It is becoming a kind of obsession among the villagers to send their children to Lahore for college education, while there is a Degree college in the nearby city, Nankana Sahib. At the moment more than ten youngsters are attending different colleges at Lahore while many are studying at their own district degree college, Govt. Gurunanak college, Nankana Sahib. Women education is also becoming more and more prevalent and appreciated in the village, which once was understood as a curse, some twenty to thirty years ago. A young girl of Bhatti clan broke the ice of getting higher education which encouraged the next generation of girls. Now many girls are looking for getting higher education with the view of becoming more useful and responsible next generation citizens of the country. Professional education The people of Kalibair at the moment are well equipped with professional education. Most of the students are testing their talent in various professional fields. The majority has chosen education as their profession. They are working as Elementary and Secondary school teachers in government schools. More than five people have gone in the field of Civil Engineering. They are working for private organisations and one is running his own business. Many people have attended classes in Nursing and Hospitalisation. They are at job at Lahore in various government and private hospitals. Six persons from Waseer Clan two male three female are doing jobs in Education department,One is in revenue department (Patwari). One person from Waseer clan has done master in commerce and doing job in textile as Manager. One person from the village has done B.Sc.Hons. in food technology and currently is serving as Lecturer at TEVTA (Technical education and Vocational training Authority) Punjab University Lahore. Just a year or two ago one person from Syed Clan passed Graduation at Law (L.L.B.) and is in practice at District courts Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. Along with these notable persons, there are many young persons in the fields of Commerce, Accounting, Computer Sciences, Agriculture, Driving, Language, Literature, Banking and Mass communication. Jobs A few decades in the past the villagers mainly lived on agriculture only. The people who had many pieces of land were financially good, however the rest of the population was living at or below the poverty line. This poverty would often force the people to take short cuts for getting money which would lead them to criminal activities, like stealing, selling wine(Selling and purchasing of alcohol is illegal in Pakistan), robbery etc. However in the recent years many people from the village moved to nearby cities, some even to the distant business hubs of Pakistan Lahore and Karachi. Some even went abroad. Now Kalibair people are in U.A.E, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Malaysia. This changed the financial map of the village and people returned to jobs and businesses to get rid of the acute poverty they had been facing for years. Army and police services Many people of Kalibair have been and are in Army and Police departments. Due to the hard life led by the villagers, the people are natural athletes and physically quite tough. Some people of the village have been serving among the special services group(SSG)in Pakistan Army. Before Partition of India people from this village have been selected for Indian Army to fight in World War I and World War II on Berman and Japanese borders. One person from Syed clan has been taken as prisoner in 1971 Indo-Pak war. Until recent years this area has also been selected for the War exercise of Pakistan Army. The village people have also good record in being preferred for Punjab Police. At the moment three persons are service in Punjab Police and Elite Force. This is really strange to know that the village people instead of being thought best to use as a force against crime, always tend to make some way of doing a criminal activity. Even after a hundred persons being in the government posts and law enforcement institutions.

Its students include Michael Jackson, Linda Ronstadt, and Barry Manilow, and its teachers Henry Mancini, Bill Conti, and Lalo Schifrin. Grove was born in Lakeville, Indiana. At the University of Denver he studied music and then taught piano locally. In 1957 he moved to Los Angeles and taught at the Westlake School of Music. Westlake concentrated on the Schillinger System, which served as a basis for the first curricula at Berklee School of Music (which was called the Schillinger House of Music). In his Composing & Arranging Program, he mentions that he studied the Schillinger System for nine years. He established the Dick Grove School of Music in Los Angeles in 1973. After the school closed in 1991, he established the Grove School Without Walls, a distance-learning school where he taught Musicianship and Modern Harmony, Composing and Arranging, and Jazz Keyboard via a series of books and accompanying videos and DVDs. While operating the Grove School and the School without Walls, Grove published many books on musicianship, jazz harmony, ear training, improvisation, composing, and arranging as related to contemporary styles of music. He pioneered innovative concepts such as tying the study of chord symbols, jazz harmony and chord-scale-theory to ear training by using movable do solfege; the concept of chord families to organize all possible chords (including all extended chords); the concept of plural interior chords and \\"assumed roots\\" within a chord family, which is instrumental in systematically organizing slash chords, polychords, and \\"upper structure\\" voicings used in jazz; the \\"grid\\" concept, an expanded circle of fifths that helps to visualize and analyze chord progressions moving through different momentary keys) according to criteria of good voice leading; the concept of \\"shapes\\" as a systematic approach to understanding voicings, a comprehensive approach to jazz harmonization and reharmonization.

Although palm-like in appearance, it is not a palm. Etymology 'Queen sago' alludes to the name 'king sago' given to the related Cycas revoluta, as well as to its use as a source of edible starch. The specific epithet rumphii honours the German-born Dutch naturalist Georg Eberhard Rumphius (1628‚Äì1702), who served first as a military officer with the Dutch East India Company in Ambon, then with the civil merchant service of the same company. Description Bark The cycad is a small tree, growing to about in height, with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is grey and distinctively fissured into rectangular, or diamond-shaped, segments. The leaves grow from the crown ‚Äì bright green, glossy, palm-like fronds, long, with 150‚Äì200 leaflets on each frond. The spiny petiole is long. The male plant's strobilus, or cone, is oblong-ellipsoidal, long, orange in colour and foetid in odour. The female's megasporophylls are about 30 cm long, fleshy, brown and densely hairy, with the fertile area about wide. The seeds are 45 mm long and 30 mm wide, ripening from green to an orange- or reddish- brown colour. Distribution and habitat The cycad's range is centred on the Maluku Islands, extending northwards to Sulawesi, eastwards to New Guinea, and westwards to Java and southern Borneo. It also occurs on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean south of Java, in Australia's Top End (Darwin), and in Western Australia. It is cultivated in Fiji and Vanuatu. It is largely a species of tropical closed forest or woodland on calcareous soils in coastal habitats. It is often found on stabilised dunes formed of coralline sand and limestone.Hill, K. D. (2009). Cycas rumphii. In: IUCN 2010. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2010.4. Downloaded on 6 December 2010. Female plant with megasporophylls, or fertile leaves, at the Berlin Botanic Garden Relationships C. rumphii is part of a species complex which also includes C. circinalis from India, Sri Lanka, Indochina and southern China, and C. thouarsii from the Seychelles, Madagascar and eastern Africa. Differences between these taxa, which have sometimes been considered conspecific, lie mainly in the shape and indentation of the lamina of the megasporophylls. Uses The trunk of the cycad contains a starchy pith from which sago can be prepared by drying, grinding and washing. The seeds contain a toxic glucoside, pakoein, but can be treated to become edible by pounding, repeated washing, and cooking. The bark, seeds and sap are used in poultices to treat sores. Status and conservation Although the species is locally abundant, it is assessed as near threatened because it has undergone habitat loss across its range, and the population trend is decreasing.

At a high level, the field seeks to develop and improve methods for exploring this data, which often has multiple levels of meaningful hierarchy, in order to discover new insights about how people learn in the context of such settings. In doing so, EDM has contributed to theories of learning investigated by researchers in educational psychology and the learning sciences.R. Baker (2010) Data Mining for Education. In McGaw, B., Peterson, P., Baker, E. (Eds.) International Encyclopedia of Education (3rd edition), vol. 7, pp. 112-118. Oxford, UK: Elsevier. The field is closely tied to that of learning analytics, and the two have been compared and contrasted. Definition Educational data mining refers to techniques, tools, and research designed for automatically extracting meaning from large repositories of data generated by or related to people's learning activities in educational settings. Quite often, this data is extensive, fine-grained, and precise. For example, several learning management systems (LMSs) track information such as when each student accessed each learning object, how many times they accessed it, and how many minutes the learning object was displayed on the user's computer screen. As another example, intelligent tutoring systems record data every time a learner submits a solution to a problem. They may collect the time of the submission, whether or not the solution matches the expected solution, the amount of time that has passed since the last submission, the order in which solution components were entered into the interface, etc. The precision of this data is such that even a fairly short session with a computer-based learning environment (e.g. 30 minutes) may produce a large amount of process data for analysis. In other cases, the data is less fine- grained. For example, a student's university transcript may contain a temporally ordered list of courses taken by the student, the grade that the student earned in each course, and when the student selected or changed his or her academic major. EDM leverages both types of data to discover meaningful information about different types of learners and how they learn, the structure of domain knowledge, and the effect of instructional strategies embedded within various learning environments. These analyses provide new information that would be difficult to discern by looking at the raw data. For example, analyzing data from an LMS may reveal a relationship between the learning objects that a student accessed during the course and their final course grade. Similarly, analyzing student transcript data may reveal a relationship between a student's grade in a particular course and their decision to change their academic major. Such information provides insight into the design of learning environments, which allows students, teachers, school administrators, and educational policy makers to make informed decisions about how to interact with, provide, and manage educational resources. History While the analysis of educational data is not itself a new practice, recent advances in educational technology, including the increase in computing power and the ability to log fine-grained data about students' use of a computer-based learning environment, have led to an increased interest in developing techniques for analyzing the large amounts of data generated in educational settings. This interest translated into a series of EDM workshops held from 2000 to 2007 as part of several international research conferences.C. Romero, S. Ventura. Educational Data Mining: A Review of the State-of-the-Art. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews. 40(6), 601-618, 2010. In 2008, a group of researchers established what has become an annual international research conference on EDM, the first of which took place in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\\"http://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2008/\\" Retrieved 2013-09-04 As interest in EDM continued to increase, EDM researchers established an academic journal in 2009, the Journal of Educational Data Mining, for sharing and disseminating research results. In 2011, EDM researchers established the International Educational Data Mining Society to connect EDM researchers and continue to grow the field. With the introduction of public educational data repositories in 2008, such as the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Centre's (PSLC) DataShop and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public data sets have made educational data mining more accessible and feasible, contributing to its growth.

Baker and Kalina Yacef identified the following four goals of EDM: #Predicting students' future learning behavior ‚Äì With the use of student modeling, this goal can be achieved by creating student models that incorporate the learner's characteristics, including detailed information such as their knowledge, behaviours and motivation to learn. The user experience of the learner and their overall satisfaction with learning are also measured. #Discovering or improving domain models ‚Äì Through the various methods and applications of EDM, discovery of new and improvements to existing models is possible. Examples include illustrating the educational content to engage learners and determining optimal instructional sequences to support the student's learning style. #Studying the effects of educational support that can be achieved through learning systems. #Advancing scientific knowledge about learning and learners by building and incorporating student models, the field of EDM research and the technology and software used. Users and stakeholders There are four main users and stakeholders involved with educational data mining. These include: * Learners ‚Äì Learners are interested in understanding student needs and methods to improve the learner's experience and performance. For example, learners can also benefit from the discovered knowledge by using the EDM tools to suggest activities and resources that they can use based on their interactions with the online learning tool and insights from past or similar learners. For younger learners, educational data mining can also inform parents about their child's learning progress. It is also necessary to effectively group learners in an online environment. The challenge is using the complex data to learn and interpret these groups through developing actionable models.Azarnoush, Bahareh, et al. \\"Toward a Framework for Learner Segmentation.\\" JEDM-Journal of Educational Data Mining 5.2 (2013): 102-126. * Educators ‚Äì Educators attempt to understand the learning process and the methods they can use to improve their teaching methods. Educators can use the applications of EDM to determine how to organize and structure the curriculum, the best methods to deliver course information and the tools to use to engage their learners for optimal learning outcomes. In particular, the distillation of data for human judgment technique provides an opportunity for educators to benefit from EDM because it enables educators to quickly identify behavioural patterns, which can support their teaching methods during the duration of the course or to improve future courses. Educators can determine indicators that show student satisfaction and engagement of course material, and also monitor learning progress. * Researchers ‚Äì Researchers focus on the development and the evaluation of data mining techniques for effectiveness. A yearly international conference for researchers began in 2008, followed by the establishment of the Journal of Educational Data Mining in 2009. The wide range of topics in EDM ranges from using data mining to improve institutional effectiveness to student performance. * Administrators ‚Äì Administrators are responsible for allocating the resources for implementation in institutions. As institutions are increasingly held responsible for student success, the administering of EDM applications are becoming more common in educational settings. Faculty and advisors are becoming more proactive in identifying and addressing at-risk students. However, it is sometimes a challenge to get the information to the decision makers to administer the application in a timely and efficient manner. Phases As research in the field of educational data mining has continued to grow, a myriad of data mining techniques have been applied to a variety of educational contexts. In each case, the goal is to translate raw data into meaningful information about the learning process in order to make better decisions about the design and trajectory of a learning environment. Thus, EDM generally consists of four phases: # The first phase of the EDM process (not counting pre-processing) is discovering relationships in data. This involves searching through a repository of data from an educational environment with the goal of finding consistent relationships between variables. Several algorithms for identifying such relationships have been utilized, including classification, regression, clustering, factor analysis, social network analysis, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining. # Discovered relationships must then be validated in order to avoid overfitting. # Validated relationships are applied to make predictions about future events in the learning environment. # Predictions are used to support decision-making processes and policy decisions. During phases 3 and 4, data is often visualized or in some other way distilled for human judgment. A large amount of research has been conducted in best practices for visualizing data. Main approaches Of the general categories of methods mentioned, prediction, clustering and relationship mining are considered universal methods across all types of data mining; however, Discovery with Models and Distillation of Data for Human Judgment are considered more prominent approaches within educational data mining. Discovery with models In the Discovery with Model method, a model is developed via prediction, clustering or by human reasoning knowledge engineering and then used as a component in another analysis, namely in prediction and relationship mining. In the prediction method use, the created model's predictions are used to predict a new variable. For the use of relationship mining, the created model enables the analysis between new predictions and additional variables in the study. In many cases, discovery with models uses validated prediction models that have proven generalizability across contexts. Key applications of this method include discovering relationships between student behaviors, characteristics and contextual variables in the learning environment. Further discovery of broad and specific research questions across a wide range of contexts can also be explored using this method. Distillation of data for human judgment Humans can make inferences about data that may be beyond the scope in which an automated data mining method provides. For the use of education data mining, data is distilled for human judgment for two key purposes, identification and classification. For the purpose of identification, data is distilled to enable humans to identify well-known patterns, which may otherwise be difficult to interpret. For example, the learning curve, classic to educational studies, is a pattern that clearly reflects the relationship between learning and experience over time. Data is also distilled for the purposes of classifying features of data, which for educational data mining, is used to support the development of the prediction model. Classification helps expedite the development of the prediction model, tremendously. The goal of this method is to summarize and present the information in a useful, interactive and visually appealing way in order to understand the large amounts of education data and to support decision making. In particular, this method is beneficial to educators in understanding usage information and effectiveness in course activities. Key applications for the distillation of data for human judgment include identifying patterns in student learning, behavior, opportunities for collaboration and labeling data for future uses in prediction models. Applications A list of the primary applications of EDM is provided by Cristobal Romero and Sebastian Ventura. In their taxonomy, the areas of EDM application are: * Analysis and visualization of data * Providing feedback for supporting instructors * Recommendations for students * Predicting student performance * Student modeling * Detecting undesirable student behaviors * Grouping students * Social network analysis * Developing concept maps * Constructing courseware ‚Äì EDM can be applied to course management systems such as open source Moodle. Moodle contains usage data that includes various activities by users such as test results, amount of readings completed and participation in discussion forums. Data mining tools can be used to customize learning activities for each user and adapt the pace in which the student completes the course. This is in particularly beneficial for online courses with varying levels of competency. * Planning and scheduling New research on mobile learning environments also suggests that data mining can be useful. Data mining can be used to help provide personalized content to mobile users, despite the differences in managing content between mobile devices and standard PCs and web browsers. New EDM applications will focus on allowing non-technical users use and engage in data mining tools and activities, making data collection and processing more accessible for all users of EDM. Examples include statistical and visualization tools that analyzes social networks and their influence on learning outcomes and productivity. Courses # In October 2013, Coursera offered a free online course on \\"Big Data in Education\\" that taught how and when to use key methods for EDM. This course moved to edX in the summer of 2015, and has continued to run on edX annually since then. A course archive is now available online. # Teachers College, Columbia University offers a MS in Learning Analytics.  Publication venues  Considerable amounts of EDM work are published at the peer-reviewed International Conference on Educational Data Mining, organized by the International Educational Data Mining Society. * 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2008) ‚Äì Montreal, Canada * 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2009) ‚Äì Cordoba, Spain * 3rd International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2010) ‚Äì Pittsburgh, PA, USA * 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2011) ‚Äì Eindhoven, Netherlands * 5th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2012) ‚Äì Chania, Greece * 6th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2013) ‚Äì Memphis, TN, USA * 7th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2014) ‚Äì London, UK * 8th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2015) ‚Äì Madrid, Spain * 9th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2016) ‚Äì Raleigh, NC, USA * 10th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2017) ‚Äì Wuhan, China * 11th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (2018) ‚Äì Buffalo, NY, USA EDM papers are also published in the Journal of Educational Data Mining (JEDM). Many EDM papers are routinely published in related conferences, such as Artificial Intelligence and Education, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization. In 2011, Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Taylor and Francis Group published the first Handbook of Educational Data Mining. This resource was created for those that are interested in participating in the educational data mining community.  Contests In 2010, the Association for Computing Machinery's KDD Cup was conducted using data from an educational setting. The data set was provided by the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center's DataShop, and it consisted of over 1,000,000 data points from students using a cognitive tutor. Six hundred teams competed for over 8,000 USD in prize money (which was donated by Facebook). The goal for contestants was to design an algorithm that, after learning from the provided data, would make the most accurate predictions from new data. The winners submitted an algorithm that utilized feature generation (a form of representation learning), random forests, and Bayesian networks. Costs and challenges Along with technological advancements are costs and challenges associated with implementing EDM applications. These include the costs to store logged data and the cost associated with hiring staff dedicated to managing data systems. Moreover, data systems may not always integrate seamlessly with one another and even with the support of statistical and visualization tools, creating one simplified version of the data can be difficult. Furthermore, choosing which data to mine and analyze can also be challenging, making the initial stages very time consuming and labor- intensive. From beginning to end, the EDM strategy and implementation requires one to uphold privacy and ethics for all stakeholders involved. Criticisms * Generalizability ‚Äì Research in EDM may be specific to the particular educational setting and time in which the research was conducted, and as such, may not be generalizable to other institutions. Research also indicates that the field of educational data mining is concentrated in western countries and cultures and subsequently, other countries and cultures may not be represented in the research and findings. Development of future models should consider applications across multiple contexts. * Privacy ‚Äì Individual privacy is a continued concern for the application of data mining tools. With free, accessible and user-friendly tools in the market, students and their families may be at risk from the information that learners provide to the learning system, in hopes to receive feedback that will benefit their future performance. As users become savvy in their understanding of online privacy, administrators of educational data mining tools need to be proactive in protecting the privacy of their users and be transparent about how and with whom the information will be used and shared. Development of EDM tools should consider protecting individual privacy while still advancing the research in this field. * Plagiarism ‚Äì Plagiarism detection is an ongoing challenge for educators and faculty whether in the classroom or online. However, due to the complexities associated with detecting and preventing digital plagiarism in particular, educational data mining tools are not currently sophisticated enough to accurately address this issue. Thus, the development of predictive capability in plagiarism-related issues should be an area of focus in future research. * Adoption ‚Äì It is unknown how widespread the adoption of EDM is and the extent to which institutions have applied and considered implementing an EDM strategy. As such, it is unclear whether there are any barriers that prevent users from adopting EDM in their educational settings.

It was an influential early blues composition and has been recorded by numerous artists, including Junior Parker and Al Green, whose renditions were hits on the record charts. Original song Roosevelt Sykes' \\"Driving Wheel Blues\\" is a solo twelve-bar blues, with Sykes providing piano accompaniment to his vocal. The song is performed at a medium tempo with the opening lyrics: Sykes' recorded the song on February 18, 1936, for Decca Records. It was released before 'Billboard magazine or a similar service began tracking such singles, but \\"Driving Wheel\\" is identified as influential early blues composition.

Although Parker's vocal line and lyrics follow Sykes' late 1940s version, the song uses a group arrangement with a horn section and adds a break in the middle of the song. Musician and music writer Billy Vera notes: \\"Fronting a horn section was really how Junior heard himself. He was a singer, not a shouter. His voice was sweet, his vibrato throbbing... [his songs] were all more melodic than the average blues.\\" Most subsequent versions of \\"Driving Wheel\\" show Parker's influence, including the distinctive bass line.

Biography He was born on December 5, 1881 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on 18 June 18, 1907, attended School of Application, starting his first assignment on 25 December 1908 aboard in time to participate in the cruise of the Great White Fleet. On 25 December 1909, he was reassigned to the Marine Barracks at Naval Station Norfolk, and promoted to first lieutenant on 25 May 1910. The same day, he departed for the Philippines, arriving in Manila on 2 December and remaining there until departing for Peking, China on 1 August 1912. While there, he would command the Mounted Detachment of the China Marines from 18 December 1912 to 9 July 1913.Donnelly, 1982 After a brief stayover at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, McClellan served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Washington, D.C. from 14 November 1913 to 9 February 1917. His work was mostly writing, preparing the Index-Digest of Court-Martial Orders from 1914 to 1916, and the Naval Digest of 1916. During this assignment, he attended the George Washington University Law School, graduating in 1916, and was promoted to captain on 29 August of that same year.

On 8 September, the Historical Section, Adjutant and Inspectors Department, was established by Marine Corps Order No. 53, and McClellan was ordered in charge, a post he would hold until 1925. The section consisted of one officer and several enlisted clerks. On 7 Nov, 1924 Private Arman Manookian, a young artist, was assigned as one of McClellan‚Äôs clerks.Papanikolas, 2010 Manookian On 21 October 1921, Maj McClellan suggested to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, MajGen John A. Lejeune, that 10 November be designated as the birth date of the Marine Corps, an anniversary that had not typically been celebrated to that point. He suggested the date be declared a holiday, with celebrations held throughout the Corps, to include a ball. Lejeune issued Marine Corps Order No. 47, which mandated this celebration, and the order would be republished each year at the United States Marine Corps birthday ball. Also during his tenure, he was Secretary- Treasurer of the Marine Corps Association from 1 July 1921 to 1 October 1922, and edited five issues of the Marine Corps Gazette. On 1 June 1925, McClellan was transferred to the Marine Barracks at Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii, and took Manookian with him. McClellan departed Hawaii 15 November 1927, when he briefly toured the Western Recruiting Region. On 19 October 1928 he joined the 5th Marine Regiment to serve as a photographer of the occupation of Nicaragua until 24 July of the next year. After a brief stop in Quantico to attend the Field Officer‚Äôs Course, he returned to direct the Historical Section again on 20 June 1930. During this second tour, he compiled a seven-volume history of the Corps, but the Great Depression made printing unfeasible, to which he resorted to hand-mimeographed copies for distribution.In 1954, the New York Public Library microfilmed the McClellan history, the closest to publication the work has achieved. Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 March 1934, McClellan performed a brief tour at the end of the occupation of Haiti from 15 June to 15 August that same year. After a few months at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, he was sent to Shanghai to serve with the 4th Marine Regiment briefly before being diverted to the Philippines again. There, he commanded the Marine Barracks at the Cavite Navy Yard until his retirement on 30 June 1936. In retirement, McClellan returned briefly to Philadelphia before moving to Honolulu, only to return in 1941. He lived there until his death on July 25, 1971 at Naval Hospital Philadelphia. Publications McClellan‚Äôs published works consist of more than a hundred articles and books, some of which include: * The Naval Digest: Containing Digests of Selected Decisions of the Secretary of the Navy and Opinions of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, Washington, United States Government Printing Office, 1916. * The True Sandino, (no publisher), 1934.

Notes * The cartoon is recognized as Lantz's first fully independent film. In early 1940, Universal Pictures, which was facing severe financial problems, decided to cut Lantz's weekly advance, forcing the producer to shut down the studio for a while.

The intelligence information to be gathered included biometric information and passwords and other authentication keys used in official communications. The directives were revealed as part of the United States diplomatic cables leak in late 2010. While spying by the US on the UN was not new, the directive's aggressive goals for information gathering and desire for use of regular diplomats in the gathering was, and caused a strain in relations between the US and UN. The directive In July 2009, a confidential cable originating from the United States Department of State, and under US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's name, ordered US diplomats to spy on Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other top UN officials. The intelligence information the diplomats were ordered to gather included biometric information (which apparently included DNA, fingerprints, and iris scans), passwords, and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications. It also included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit card numbers, frequent flier account numbers, and work schedules. The targeted human intelligence was requested in a process known as the National Humint Collection Directive, and was aimed at foreign diplomats of US allies as well. The news of the cable and directive was revealed by website WikiLeaks on 28 November 2010, as part of the overall United States diplomatic cables leak. The disclosed cables on the more aggressive intelligence gathering went back to 2008 when they went out under Condoleezza Rice's name during her tenure as Secretary of State. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley stated that Clinton had not drafted the directive and that the Secretary of State's name is systematically attached to the bottom of cables originating from Washington. In fact, further leaked material revealed that the guidance in the cables was actually written by the Central Intelligence Agency before being sent out under Clinton's name, as the CIA cannot directly instruct State Department personnel. Specifically, the effort came from the National Clandestine Service, a CIA service formed in the years following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks with the goal of better coordinating human intelligence activities. According to former US officials, the instructions given in these cables may have been largely ignored by American diplomats as ill-advised. Breach of international laws The UN had previously declared that spying on the secretary-general was illegal, as a breach of the 1946 UN convention. Peter Kemp, Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and international-law professor Ben Saul, publicly asked Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of Australia, to complain \\"to the U.S. about both Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton being in major breach of International law ie UN Covenants, by making orders to spy on UN personnel, including the Secretary General, to include theft of their credit card details and communication passwords. Perhaps the Attorney General should investigate this clear prima facie evidence of crime (likely against Australian diplomats as well), rather than he attempts to prosecute the messenger of those crimes.\\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed that not only Secretary Clinton, but \\"the whole chain of command who was aware of this order, and approved it, must resign if the U.S. is to be seen to be a credible nation that obeys the rule of law.\\" When asked whether US President Barack Obama was also responsible for the order and should resign, Assange added that \\"the order is so serious it may well have been put to the president for approval\\", and that \\"Obama must answer what he knew about this illegal order and when. If he refuses to answer or there is evidence he approved of these actions, he must resign.\\" President of Venezuela Hugo Ch√°vez also said that Clinton should resign. International reactions The practice of the US and the State Department gathering intelligence on the UN was not new. Former UN diplomats commented that UN officials already work under the assumption that they are spied on and are used to getting around it, but the surprise in this case was that it was done by other diplomats rather than intelligence agencies. The Guardian wrote that the directive \\"appears to blur the line between diplomacy and spying\\". Another surprise was the specific types of information being asked for, including the biometric information and credit card and frequent flyer numbers, which went beyond past practice and was not the kind of information diplomats would normally be expected to gather. At this early December 2010 summit in Kazakhstan, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (center left) expressed her regrets to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon (far left) for the leaked disclosures regarding US diplomats spying on the UN. Staff at the UN privately expressed unhappiness at the apparent scale of the intelligence-gathering operation, and the UN sought an official explanation from the US. On 1 December, Clinton and Ban met at a summit of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Astana, Kazakhstan, where Clinton was doing damage control with world leaders regarding the embarrassing contents of the State Department cables overall. In an attempt to repair the strain for the Humint relevations, Clinton expressed regret for the disclosures, but did not make an apology per se. A UN statement relayed that Ban thanked Clinton \\"for clarifying the matter and for expressing her concern about the difficulties created.\\" Germany Ministry of the Interior Thomas de Maizi√®re said he was \\"astounded\\" by the order, though he expressed regret that Wikileaks activity was being focused on \\"transparent and open Western democracies\\" instead of \\"the world's dictatorships and oppressive regimes\\" and thus lacked \\"genuine informative purpose\\". Former US official [Carl W. Ford Jr.|[Carl Ford called the order \\"unprecedented\\", although \\"other U.S. diplomats said such headquarters directives were a longtime and routine practice\\", albeit one which was \\"not always fully obeyed.\\" The Guardian quoted Carne Ross, \\"a former British diplomat at the UN who now runs the Independent Diplomat advisory group\\", as saying that \\"The fact that the US is spying on the UN can't be a surprise. Lots of countries do it, including our own.\\" Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to the United States, said that it would be a \\"serious misinterpretation\\" to conclude that the cables were asking diplomats to spy, adding that \\"In reality this is the usual vast bureaucratic laundry list dumped by the US intelligence establishment on diplomats around the world asking them to do a number of things\\".

History Adron Doran, who had served as president from 1954 to 1977, played a pivotal role in the expansion of Morehead State from a rural teacher training school into a large- scale state university. In addition to expanding the academic curriculum and introducing racial integration to the campus, Doran also felt the need to make the campus of Morehead State feel more like a home to students. Along with adding more dormitories and on-campus living areas, Doran also sought to create a designated building to serve students in a variety of ways, as a place to study, socialize, and serve basic needs for students. In addition, Doran would make sure that the building bore his namesake. Adron Doran Was born September 1, 1909, in Graves County, Western Kentucky. Some would say that he was one of the most influential and progressive of all the former presidents, because of the vast changes he brought about in a time where the school was still in a very infantile state. Graduated From Freed-Hardman College in Henderson, Tennessee. Former Kentucky House speaker and state representative. Earned a doctorate from the University of Kentucky in 1950. Was named President of Morehead State University in 1954 and then retired in 1977.

It is an example of a two-component system, in that it has a sensor molecule and a response regulator. The Regulation of Various Genes It has been determined that the Arc system regulates as many as 30 genes, with repression of the following examples: cytochrome o oxidase, cytochrome d oxidase, and various gluconeogenic enzymes, such as for the glyoxylate cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. It also induces the expression of Pyruvate formate lyase. Mechanism of the Arc System The Arc system uses a two component regulatory system. The sensor, ArcB, is an unusual histidine kinase in that it contains three signaling domains. ArcB senses the redox state of the cell, and becomes phosphorylated. The phosphate is shuttled onto various signalling domains until it winds up on ArcA, the response regulator. The phosphorylated ArcA is then able to act as either an activator or repressor for various metabolic genes. So, when oxygen is low, then gene products that utilize oxygen will be repressed, while genes that do not require oxygen will be upregulated.

Moriarty (born September 10, 1946) is an American lawyer noted for mass torts against major corporations, including Tenet Healthcare Corporation, Shell Chemicals, DuPont, and Prudential Securities. His legal cases have been described in the books Serpent on the Rock by Kurt Eichenwald, Money-Driven Medicine: The Real Reason Health Care Costs So Much by Maggie Mahar, and Coronary by Stephen Klaidman. Moriarty is a former Marine and Gold Star father. Early life Moriarty was born on September 10, 1946, in Schenectady, New York, shortly after his twin brother Robert James Moriarty, who was born the previous day. He dropped out of high school in January 1965 to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. Military experience  Vietnam combat Marine  Moriarty completed Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) San Diego with Platoon 212 in May 1965, received meritorious promotion to private first class. He then attended multiple \\"A\\" schools at Naval Air Technical Training Command Memphis, receiving meritorious promotion to lance corporal. He was offered his choice of assignment and served three tours in the Vietnam War. He was awarded two single-mission Air Medals for heroic achievement while serving as a door gunner in a Marine Observation Squadron 2 helicopter gunship squadron located at Marble Mountain in South Vietnam. He was released from active duty as a sergeant in January 1969.  Advocate for veterans   Operation Tailwind  On June 7, 1998, CNN broadcast a story titled ‚ÄúValley of Death‚Äù that purported to offer new, alarming information about a Vietnam War mission called Operation Tailwind. According to the story, U.S. Special Forces advanced into Laos to kill American defectors, dropping sarin nerve gas and killing women and children. A print version of the story appeared in Time magazine, CNN's news partner in the program, called NewsStand. The story was proven to be false, and on July 2, 1998, the network retracted it in full, issuing a 54-page retraction. An investigation into how the report was allowed to be broadcast concluded that reporters relied too much on information that supported their thesis, failing to properly weigh contrary information. > The CNN broadcast was not fair. Information that was inconsistent with the > underlying conclusions reached by CNN was ignored or minimized. ... > Statements of sources that were vague, ambiguous or qualified were relied > upon as if they were clear, focused and unambiguous. Moriarty represented three of the veterans who had been defamed, underwriting a documentary to tell the story of Tailwind from their point of view and shine a light on the irresponsible actions of the CNN journalists. One veteran recounted turning on the TV with interest after CNN promoted a new program called NewsStand, then realizing the story was about him and his fellow soldiers. ‚ÄúThe more I watched it, the worse it got. There was nothing in that entire broadcast that was true,‚Äù Army veteran Keith Plancich said. As the veterans explain, they were sent into Laos to cause a diversion and draw the North Vietnamese away from a group of CIA mercenaries. The team ‚Äúescaped with the largest cache of enemy intelligence documents ever recovered in the war, and only three of their 156 soldiers killed,‚Äù according to a summary of the documentary.  Medal of Honor recipient Gary M. Rose  Retired Army Capt. Gary M. Rose, speaking at the Pentagon, received the Medal of Honor in 2017 for his heroic actions during Operation Tailwind. Moriarty advocated for retired Army Capt. Gary M. Rose to receive the Medal of Honor decades after his name had originally been submitted. Capt. Rose was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1971 for saving lives over four days despite being wounded himself during a Vietnam War mission called Operation Tailwind. As recounted in the New York Times: > By the fourth day, when helicopters came to extract the team, enemy troops > were so close that American planes dropped tear gas on their own men to > drive the enemy back. Sergeant Rose was one of the last on the last > helicopter, firing as he hobbled aboard. When they lifted clear of the > trees, he slumped to the floor of the helicopter, his marathon mission > complete. Then a bullet pierced the neck of a door gunner, and the medic was > up again. Out of bandages, he stopped the bleeding with a spare piece of > cloth. As he worked, enemy fire hit the engines. The crippled aircraft > crashed on a riverbank, spitting out men as it rolled. Sergeant Rose, > bleeding from his head, crawled into the wreckage. Moriarty for years advocated for Capt. Rose's Medal of Honor packet to be reconsidered. Special legislation was required due to the amount of time that had passed since Rose's service. Rose received the nation's highest combat award in 2017.  U.S. Army Col. Paris D. Davis  Moriarty is pressing the U.S. government to expedite its review of the nomination of U.S. Army Col. Paris D. Davis for the Medal of Honor ‚Äï a nomination that has languished since 1969. Col. Davis was one of the first African-Americans to serve as an officer in the Special Forces. Davis retired from the Special Forces in 1985. Then- Capt. Davis distinguished himself 17‚Äì18 June 1965 in action against the Viet Cong around Bong Son, Binh Dinh Province, Republic of Vietnam. ‚ÄúI only have to close my eyes to vividly recall the gallantry of this individual who, through physical strength and complete disregard for himself, killed and destroyed 39 heavily armed North Vietnamese, saved a group of friendly infantry soldiers, and was instrumental in disrupting a complete [North Vietnamese Army] take- over of II Corps,‚Äù Master Sgt. William D. Waugh wrote in his recommendation of Davis for the Medal of Honor. Davis‚Äô team ‚Äúclobbered the Viet Cong,‚Äù according to Maj. Billy Cole, who submitted the original nomination packet in July 1965. As of early 2018, the nomination packet for Col. Davis was pending with the U.S. Army Chief of Staff's office.  Volunteer service  Moriarty served on the board of directors of the United States Marine Corps Combat Helicopter Association from 1998 to 2008 and published that organization's quarterly magazine, Popasmoke. (This is a reference to the phrase \\"pop a smoke,\\" used by Marines who served in the Vietnam War. Helicopter crews asked ground crews to pop a smoke grenade so they could locate them and find a landing zone.) Moriarty received the association's Arnold W. Barden Award for advancing the reputation of the association for his air show work as well as his contribution as publisher of Popasmoke. He served on the board of directors of the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation, the group that founded the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia. He was the president of the Skyhawk Association from 1998 to 2000. Education He earned Bachelor of Business Administration and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Houston. He was admitted to the State Bar of Texas in 1976 and the Colorado Bar Association in 2006. Career Moriarty founded Moriarty & Associates in 1986. Moriarty and partners have obtained billions of dollars in awards for clients over a career spanning four decades. Moriarty is an expert in mass torts, a type of case in which many similar cases are grouped together but each case is weighed on its own merits. (This is not to be confused with class actions, which also involve many claimants but typically result in smaller awards for the plaintiffs.) Moriarty's work has targeted makers of faulty medical devices, peddlers of shoddy investments, and medical providers that exploit Medicaid patients. Moriarty served as special assistant to the former mayor of Houston, Bill White, throughout White's term in office. Among other duties, Moriarty assisted the city's attorneys on a pro bono basis, on one occasion helping the city enforce billboard laws designed to avoid \\"visual blight\\" in the city of Houston. White and Moriarty met while raising money for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.  Son's murder  Moriarty's son, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. James F. Moriarty, was murdered on Nov. 4, 2016, while on a CIA training mission in Jordan for the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, Ky. Moriarty and three other Green Berets were entering the King Faisal Air Base when they came under fire from a Jordanian soldier at the gate to the base. Killed in the ambush were Moriarty, 27; Staff Sgt. Matthew C. Lewellen, 27, of Kirksville, Mo., and Staff Sgt. Kevin J. McEnroe, 30, of Tucson, Ariz. Initially, the Jordanian government blamed the Green Berets for the incident, saying that an American soldier driving one of the vehicles ignored demands to stop, prompting \\"an exchange of gunfire.\\" The Jordanian government called the shooting a \\"chain of unfortunate events.\\" Further details on the incident were scant. Moriarty publicly criticized that explanation and said government officials had failed to tell the truth to the grieving families and the U.S. government. Moriarty told CBS News: \\"The Jordanian government lied to our government‚Ä¶ They know what happened, they know who this guy is. ‚Ä¶ They owe us an explanation. Who was it that murdered my son and why?\\" By late November, an investigation and surveillance video showed that the Americans \\"were shot without provocation\\" and had not violated security procedures at the gate, as Jordanian officials had suggested. Investigators said they were unsure what had prompted the guard to attack the Americans, having found no links to jihad or terrorist groups. Over several months, Moriarty's family pressed through the media and through political avenues for the Jordanian guard to be held to account. James R. Moriarty and the families of the other slain Green Berets held briefings with national media and members of Congress aimed at putting pressure on Jordan. Moriarty's sister launched a blog to demand more information and honor her brother's memory. \\"We will not accept the lies that are coming out to protect diplomatic relations,\\" she wrote in the inaugural post, dated three days after her brother's death. By April 2017, the Jordanian government reversed its position, admitting that the shooter, Ma'arik al- Tawayha (last name variants Abu Tayeh, al-Tawaiha), did not follow protocol. Jordan agreed to put al-Tawayha on trial in a military court. Prosecutors accused al-Tawayha \\"of voluntary manslaughter, violating military orders, and insulting the dignity and reputation of the armed forces.\\" On July 17, 2017, al-Tawayha was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The soldier who survived the attack went public with his story after the trial, describing the ambush to the New York Times in a piece published July 25, 2017, that stands as the most detailed account of the incident. \\"We kept yelling in English and Arabic, saying we were friends. And he kept shooting,\\" the soldier told the New York Times. \\"Eventually, we realized it wasn't an accident.\\" The families of the slain Green Berets in November 2018 sued the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for spreading lies about their sons, suggesting that the Americans failed to follow protocol at the gate or had been drinking alcohol, thereby prompting the shooting. U.S. investigations and video of the shooting disproved these claims. In announcing the legal action, the families voiced a need to understand any motive for the killings. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no amount of money that can take the place of my son, Jimmy,‚Äù Moriarty said at a press conference announcing the families‚Äô lawsuit. ‚ÄúBut, we want to know if there is anything else out there, any clues as to why that Jordanian soldier targeted our sons that day.‚Äù  Legal cases  Polybutylene (faulty plumbing) Moriarty was instrumental in one of the largest mass action consumer fraud cases in history, with a recovery of approximately $1.1 billion from Shell Chemicals, Hoechst Celanese and DuPont. A 1997 press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice described the historic significance of the settlement: In mid-1987, Moriarty filed the first polybutylene lawsuit against General Homes Corporation, U.S. Brass, Shell, Hoechst Celanese and DuPont on behalf of approximately 100 homeowners in a subdivision in La Porte, Texas, alleging that the plumbing system in the subdivision had failed, causing property damage and mental anguish. The homeowners sought damages for negligence, fraud, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). The complaint was that polybutylene pipes and fittings deteriorate over time due to the presence of chlorine compounds in water, resulting in leaks that can lead to property damage and creating the potential for contamination from pesticides and other toxic materials. According to Moriarty: Between 1987 and 1994, Moriarty and his partners litigated approximately 800 individual polybutylene cases, negotiating deals with Shell, Hoechst Celanese, DuPont and a variety of builders. Among the plaintiffs was a Houston-area couple whose leaky plumbing prompted them to replace carpets with cement and shut off their water before leaving home. \\"We feel like we were sold a bill of goods that wasn't any good,\\" the plaintiff told the local newspaper. In 1993, Moriarty was approached by Michael Caddell, an attorney who had filed a class action suit against Shell (Beeman v Shell Oil), and asked to join the suit. Two years later, attorneys in Cox v. Shell Oil joined with Moriarty and Caddell, and both cases were settled. The team settled with Shell and Hoechst Celanese for a minimum of $950 million, with DuPont settling separately for a minimum of $120 million. Plaintiffs in the case received free re-plumb of their homes, replacing the polybutylene pipes with safer ones made from copper, CPVC or plastic, and were compensated from the settlement, which ultimately totaled approximately $1.1 billion. The case was unique in that Moriarty and his fellow attorneys focused more on bringing relief to clients, rather than focusing on their part of the settlement. According to Moriarty: Prudential Bache investment fraud Moriarty was involved in the largest mass action filed against Prudential Securities along with Daryl Bristow and Stephen Hackerman, among others. The investigation found that PSI had defrauded investors of close to $8 billion, the largest fraud found by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in United States history to that point. Kurt Eichenwald discussed the case at length in his book on the limited partnership scandal at Prudential, Serpent on the Rock. Bristow brought in Moriarty because of his previous experience managing large numbers of clients in other mass action lawsuits. Hackerman later worked with Moriarty on the NME case in 1994. Moriarty created a computer program that allowed the lawyers to write individualized letters to the 5,800 clients they were managing. He is also credited for suggesting each plaintiff file an individual complaint to state regulators, the SEC, and the National Association of Securities Dealers ‚Äì a scheme that Eichenwald suggests alerted the SEC to the magnitude of the Prudential fraud. Prudential attempted to get the case settled for five cents on every dollar the plaintiffs had invested, a proposal Moriarty derided as ridiculous. The settlements for Bristow, Hackerman, and Moriarty's clients ultimately recouped the plaintiffs' lost investments entirely: After their case was concluded, Moriarty remained involved with the National Association of Securities Dealers working with the SEC to investigate PSI's suspected fraud. When Nancy Smith, a New Mexico securities regulator, asked him for advice on creating a questionnaire for the investors in PSI, he recommended her to a polling expert from Rice University. When Smith informed him that she could not afford the estimated cost of $5,000-$10,000 for utilizing those resources, Moriarty paid for it himself from his fees from the PSI case. National Medical Enterprises/Tenet Healthcare  Texas psychiatric hospitals  Moriarty, in conjunction with several other firms, filed a mass tort against National Medical Enterprises in late 1994 behalf of approximately 600 patients who charged that they had been abused in Texas psychiatric hospitals owned by the company in order to defraud insurance companies and the U.S. Federal Government. The case was discussed in depth in Stephen Klaidman's book Coronary. The lawsuit was settled on July 30, 1997. The New York Times reported a $100 million settlement for all plaintiffs involved in two lawsuits filed in Conroe, TX and Fort Worth, TX. Moriarty was unable to disclose the exact settlement their clients received, but The Times reported that 620 cases were filed in Conroe and settled for $85 million, and approximately 60 cases were settled in Fort Worth for $13 million; also that Moriarty represented \\"over 600\\" of the plaintiffs. National Medical Enterprises changed its name to Tenet Healthcare Corporation in March 1995.  Unnecessary heart surgeries  Again in conjunction with other firms, in 2003 Moriarty filed new lawsuits against the new Tenet Healthcare Corporation's Redding Medical Center on behalf of approximately 450 patients who claimed they had received unnecessary heart surgeries so that the company could bill insurance companies for the procedures. The company settled with 750 plaintiffs for the sum of $395 million in December 2004. In addition to its individual settlements with the plaintiffs, Tenet paid $54 million in fines for its conduct at Redding Medical Center. Tenet also paid $900 million in fines and settlements to the U.S. Federal Government for manipulating the Medicare system in connection with its hospital operations. The settlement remains one of the largest settlements under the False Claims Act. (The largest such settlement was with GlaxoSmithKline, which paid $2 billion in civil penalties in a case stemming from illegal marketing of prescription drugs.) Moriarty's personal opinions on the major players of NME/Tenet Healthcare are quoted in Money-Driven Medicine: Beijing and Vancouver Olympics ticket controversy Moriarty drew attention to the problem of illegal ticket sales in the 2008 Beijing Olympics after purchasing a reported $12,000 worth of tickets that were never delivered. About 2,500 people around the world were similarly scammed, according to British government investigators. The victims included families of Olympic athletes. Moriarty assisted ticketholders in obtaining fraud protection from their credit card companies, offering this work as a pro-bono service. Through an advocacy and PR campaign, he exposed the perpetrators of the ticketing fraud and drew international attention to the problem of scant ticket access for Olympic families. In 2010, Moriarty spoke out against the International Olympic Committee (IOC), pointing to two \\"serious problems.\\" First, that the organization had \\"not curbed ticket reselling abuses that enrich profiteers connected to the IOC and National Olympic Committees (NOCs).\\" Second, they were \\"inconsistently policing the use of Olympic trademarks\\" that often were used on fraudulent ticket sites.\\" He also said that the IOC and United States Olympic Committee (USOC) did not make adequate efforts to shut down ticket sellers illegally operating under the IOC's trade names, which made it difficult for consumers to determine the difference between legitimate and illegitimate sellers. Moriarty defended ticket reseller Gene Hammett against Joseph Bunevacz and his son David Bunevacz, whom Hammett claimed sold him 17,000 tickets to the Vancouver games that never materialized. Hammett alleged that the Bunevaczes led him to believe that the tickets were coming from several National Olympics Committees and their official ticket agents in Europe. The perpetrators of the Beijing ticketing fraud, Terence Shepherd, Alan Scott, and Allan Schaverien, were sentenced to imprisonment in July 2011. Shepherd, the ringleader of the group operating as Xclusive Leisure and Hospitality Ltd, was \\"convicted of money laundering, two counts of fraudulent trading and two counts of acting as a company director whilst disqualified,\\" according to a summary of the case by the UK's Serious Fraud Office. Shepherd was ordered to pay ¬£1.25 million in penalties and victims' compensation, dubbed a \\"confiscation order\\" in the British court system. Scott was ordered to pay ¬£500,000. In January 2018, Shepherd's wife, Margaret Canty-Shepherd, was ordered by a court to sell the couple's ¬£3 million home (about $4 million) to pay the confiscation order. Ticketing access for Olympic families improved. For the 2010 Vancouver Games, the U.S. Olympic Committee pledged to provide athletes with two complimentary tickets for their events, and the Canadian Olympic Committee allocated to each sports federation a block of tickets for athletes to purchase. A similar policy was in place for the 2018 Winter Games held in Pyeongchang. The U.S. Olympic Committee provided athletes with two complimentary tickets for each event in which they competed, and each athlete was guaranteed the chance to purchase two tickets for their events under a program run by the PyeongChang Organizing Committee.  Abusive dentists   ImmediaDent  Moriarty represented a dentist whistleblower in a qui tam lawsuit against the corporate chain ImmediaDent, which operates nine dental care practices in Indiana, and a related company called Samson Dental Partners. The whistleblower suit alleged that ImmediaDent submitted fraudulent bills to the government for treating military families and families insured by Medicaid.

According to the lawsuit: > Defendants‚Äô business model required dentists to ‚Äòovertreat‚Äô to generate the > revenue required to support the individual clinics‚Äô payments to the > defendants.

Samson Dental Partners, LLC and ImmediaDent of Indiana, LLC agreed to pay $5.1 million to the federal government, the State of Indiana, and the whistleblower dentist, in a settlement announced by the Department of Justice in November 2018. The dentist whistleblower will receive $925,000 plus expenses, attorneys‚Äô fees and costs. The case was filed in 2013. Small Smiles Dental Centers Moriarty and his partners represent approximately 550 clients in a case against Small Smiles Dental Centers, a chain of Private Equity owned dental clinics based in Nashville, Tennessee. The chain currently operates 70 centers in 22 states, as well as centers in Washington, D.C. The case alleges that these clinics target children from low-income families who rely on Medicaid for their dental care, and that Small Smiles clinics are performing \\"assembly line\\" dentistry, resulting in multiple rushed and unnecessary dental procedures performed on children in order to profit by billing Medicaid. According to a May 2012 article from Bloomberg: The question at the heart of the issue is the legality of Private Equity owned dental clinics. State governments, including Moriarty's home state of Texas, forbid professional practices such as dental offices from being owned by unlicensed professionals. In January 2010, Small Smiles gained national attention when its parent company, FORBA, settled False Claims Act allegations with the United States Department of Justice. The DOJ claimed that Small Smiles was The 2010 settlement with the Department of Justice was for $24 million, plus interest, to be paid over five years. The DOJ's assertion was that the settlement was meant to In the report, Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, stated, \\"We have zero tolerance for those who break the law to exploit needy children. Illegal conduct like this endangers a child's well-being, distorts the judgments of health care professionals, and puts corporate profits ahead of patient safety.\\" In January 2012, possibly as a result of the settlement with the DOJ, FORBA changed its name to Church Street Health Management, a reference to the street address of the company's corporate headquarters. In February of that year, Church Street Health Management filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2014, Church Street Health Management was barred from the Medicaid program following what federal officials said were breaches of a compliance agreement aimed at ensuring appropriate standards of care.  ReachOut Healthcare America  On June 1, 2012, Moriarty brought a suit on behalf of Isaac and Joel Gagnon against Big Smiles, a school dental program operated by ReachOut Healthcare America (RHA) in Arizona. RHA is owned and controlled by Morgan Stanley Private Equity company, with four Morgan Stanley members on the RHA board. ReachOut Healthcare America and the Big Smiles program recently gained nationwide attention when the school dental service performed multiple pulpotomies and crowns on a four-year-old medically fragile child without the consent of his mother. Young Isaac Gagnon suffered shaken baby syndrome as an infant and still requires special consideration and care when receiving any sort of medical attention. For this reason, his adoptive mother, Stacey Gagnon, informed Big Smiles that they did not have permission to perform dental procedures on her son. She was surprised and alarmed, therefore, when Isaac arrived home from school having received numerous dental procedures. According to his mother, when she asked him what was wrong he could only reply, \\"Mommy, the dentist man got me.\\" Moriarty joins the case as part of his overall initiative against private equity-owned dental clinics.  Houston dentist Bethaniel S. Jefferson  Moriarty represented a family whose 4-year-old suffered brain damage stemming from a botched dental procedure on Jan. 7, 2016 by Houston, Texas-area dentist Bethaniel S. Jefferson, who practiced at Diamond Dental. \\"Both Jefferson and her staff ignored warning sounds and visual indications which showed that for a period of about five hours (the 4-year-old's) brain suffered from a severe lack of oxygen,\\" according to the plaintiffs' complaint in the family's lawsuit filed July 27, 2016 against Jefferson in Harris County District Court. The civil case was settled on May 18, 2017, with a Special Needs Trust established to benefit the 4-year-old, court records show. Jefferson's Texas dental license was revoked Nov. 18, 2016. Jefferson was also charged criminally, a rarity for cases such as hers. Jefferson was indicted on July 24, 2017, \\"accused of intentionally and knowingly by omission causing serious bodily injury to a child by failing to seek and provide adequate medical attention, a first degree felony, according to the Texas Penal Code,\\" according to a local media report. > Ms. Jefferson chose to do everything other than provide the care the victim > needed,\\" Stan Clark, Assistant Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control > Unit, and Special Prosecutor-Harris County D.A, stated. \\"As a result, the > victim has suffered permanent brain damage and will never lead a normal > life.\\" The case was spotlighted nationally by NBC News in an investigation into the dangers of dental sedation of young children. Moriarty told NBC that the problem of over-sedation stems from flawed payment incentives: \\"It's not getting better. It's getting worse. It's another procedure to sell the patient.\\"  Children's Dental Group  Moriarty represents clients in a case against Children's Dental Group, a California dental chain whose Anaheim location was the source of a bacterial outbreak in 2016. Children who developed infections from the outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus underwent surgeries and months of antibiotic treatment to counter the bacteria. M. abscessus is difficult to treat because it is resistant to standard drug treatment, a phenomenon known as \\"multi-drug resistance.\\" The Orange County, Calif., health agency tracked 73 confirmed or probable cases of infection.  Corporate and Private Equity-owned dental practices  Moriarty has worked to bring public attention to the issue of corporate ownership of dental practices, especially private-equity groups whose intent is to buy and sell dental practices for maximum profit. Such incentives drive overtreatment, and the poor are especially vulnerable to abuse, receiving treatment that is not medically necessary, Moriarty has said. \\"Unlike (professional limited liability corporations), ownership of a dental practice by a for-profit corporation introduces a fundamental conflict of interest into the business model,\\" Moriarty wrote in a 2011 paper. With a few exceptions, states bar the corporate practice of dentistry. However, corporations have sought to get around this ban by hiring dentists to serve as owners in-name-only while the corporation retains the actual day-to-day control of the dental practice. Moriarty testified at a 2012 Texas state House committee hearing about one such dental company that used an absentee dentist to front the organization. Moriarty said the company's staff restrained young patients with a device called a \\"papoose board\\" that binds the head, torso and limbs with Velcro straps. The Texas Tribune reported on the hearing: > They won't let the parents be present because the parents would be tempted > in Texas to pistol-whip them if they knew what they were going to do,\\" > Moriarty said. He's currently suing one company that operates six dental > clinics under various names in Texas and said the dentist who claims to > operate those clinics ‚Äî but actually works and treats patients in Oklahoma ‚Äî > bills Texas $12 million a year to treat Medicaid patients. The ban on the corporate ownership of dental practices stems from a legal principle, the \\"corporate practice of medicine doctrine,\\" aimed at keeping laypeople who have no medical training from interfering with the professional judgments of doctors and dentists, such as what treatments and drugs to recommend and how to hire qualified, caring medical staff. This principle was developed and supported by the American Medical Association. As of 2016 Moriarty had secured settlements worth more than $42 million on behalf of 3,000 children treated at \\"corporate clinics specializing in Medicaid patients,\\" he told the Houston Chronicle. Personal life, associations Moriarty, at right, competes in the 2009 Austin Muddy Buddy, a biathlon. Moriarty served on the board of directors for Annunciation Orthodox School in Houston. Moriarty lives in Houston, Texas. He is an avid athlete and frequently competes in races, including 5Ks, marathons, sprints, and half- Ironman triathlons. He completed his first marathon at age 60.

It survives by obtaining sugar through the connections between its roots and those of neighboring normal redwood(s), usually the parent tree from whose base it has sprouted. (Sap exchange through roots is a general phenomenon among redwoods.) About 400 are known. They can be found in both Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park and Humboldt Redwoods State Park, with eleven trees in the first. The exact locations are not publicized to protect the rare trees. They reach a maximum height of about 20 m (66 ft). Other conifers lack the ability to graft their roots, so 'albino' mutants of other species do not survive to become sizable trees. Albino redwood sightings between Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park and Roaring Camp Railroads were first sighted by Roaring Camp CEO Georgiana P Clark in 2004 and reported and shared with naturalists at Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park and botanists at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The trees were important to Native Americans and were recorded in their legends. For example, the Pomo people used them in their cleansing ceremonies. Albino redwoods are generally regarded as parasitic plants, but as of 2016 one researcher speculates that they are supported by other trees for their role in storing toxic heavy metals. Albinos apparently accumulate more metals than normal trees because defective stomata, which cause them to lose more water through transpiration, force them to compensate by taking up more water through their roots. Six phenotypes of albino redwood have been classified: white, bright yellow, cellular virescent green, pale green, mottled and nonchimeric variegated. Such mutants can be either basal (growing from a burl at the base of a tree) or aerial (branching off from a tree above the ground). The bright yellow form is exclusively aerial and is thought to be associated with excess xanthophyll production. The pale green form lacks just one specific type of chlorophyll and is almost always basal. Cellular virescent green trees have a few normal cells (whose abundance may vary over time) interspersed among the mutant cells. Ten cases are known of chimeric redwoods that have a mosaic of albino and normal tissues. Only a single chimeric redwood is known to produce cones. Formerly threatened by the Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit rail development, it has since been replanted. Three phenotypes of chimeric redwoods have been noted: sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal. In sectorial mutants, albino cells are present vertically through all cell layers, with genotype boundaries usually parallel to the stem. Mericlinal trees have mutant cells in only some cell layers and have an unstable phenotype; the albino cells can disappear and reappear in successive years. A periclinal chimera has both mutant and normal cells distributed horizontally across the tip of each bud propagating at equal rates, leading to a very stable phenotype.

The Mississippi Delta region has had the most segregated schools -- and for the longest time‚Äîof any part of the United States. As recently as the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, East Side High School in Cleveland, Mississippi, was practically all black: 359 of 360 students were African-American. Background The Delta region of Mississippi is nineteen counties in the northwest of the state, bounded on the west by the Mississippi River and the south by the Yazoo River. It is a poor region of the country's poorest state. In the center is Sunflower County, which serves as an example for the region. It is consistently 72% Black or African-American at every census. In 1960, the average income of African Americans in Sunflower County was lower than the federal poverty line. Farm mechanization in the first half of the twentieth century, among other things, had made employment prospects bad in the region. As a result, from 1940 to 1970, there was net outward migration to northern and western inner cities and suburbs and from 1970 to present, urban centers in the South outside of Mississippi. The population has been decreasing since 1930. In 1962, a colleague of civil rights worker Charles McLaurin said that Sunflower County was \\"the worst county in the worst state\\" for racial discrimination. The towns in the region were small then and remain so today. Cleveland, Mississippi, population 12,000, has barely enough population to support one high school, much less the two that it supported from 1966 to 2017. Nevertheless, the Delta region has had the most dogged commitment to school segregation of any area of the country. Brown v. Board of Education had established national education policy in 1954, but the less populated districts of the Delta were not compelled to act until the 1960s. Nevertheless, Robert B. Patterson of Sunflower County began to organize the Citizens' Councils that sponsored segregation academies in Mississippi. Cleveland established its freedom of choice plan and the Cleveland Colored Consolidated High School in 1966. Before Brown, public education for African- Americans in the Delta was neither compulsory nor free. As a result, many did not attend. Sunflower County estimated that there were 20,473 African Americans between the ages of six through twenty-one; however, only 7,709 of them were enrolled in schools. Tradition played a part; many black children had been employed in agriculture, including the October‚ÄìNovember cotton harvest season. Geography played a role: schools were not close enough to walk to and school boards did not always supply buses. And money, too played a role. In 1949‚Äì1950, Sunflower County spent the same amount on white education (28% of the population) as it did on the black (72%). Schools asked the parents of black children to pay assessments for heating the schoolhouse. When Gov. Hugh White visited Indianola in 1953, he stated that finding enough money to support the two separate school systems was the biggest financial problem of his administration. In the Delta, Brown was not just about black kids going to school with white kids; in many cases it was about going to school at all. Segregation after Brown Sunflower County, Mississippi Mississippi's first response to Brown was to do nothing and wait for court orders. The Virginia General Assembly, by contrast, implemented the Stanley Plan in 1956 and laws protecting segregation in 1958. Its first segregation academy was started in 1955, with a slew in 1959. In Mississippi, freedom of choice legislation wasn't promulgated until 1965. Mississippi's first segregation academies didn't start opening until 1967. By then Virginia's tuition grant program had been called illegal and tax-exempted status for segregated schools would soon follow. In 1969, a federal court found Mississippi's tuition grants supporting private schools‚Äîsegregation academies for the most part‚Äîillegal in Coffey v. State Educational Finance Commission. Later in 1969, U.S. v. Indianola Municipal Separate School District described Mississippi's freedom of choice plan as \\"constitutionally defective\\". All over the Delta region, parents started private schools for white children. Population had been declining, so school boards were willing to give away facilities. Sunflower County serves as an example. In 1930, it had a population of 66,000. It had built Inverness High School in 1922. By 1970, its population had shrunk to 37,047. In about 1968, the school district sold Inverness to Central Delta Academy. Along with the other two all-white private schools in the county, Indianola Academy and North Sunflower Academy, those three schools took enough white children from the Sunflower public schools to make an 80-20 mix. The private schools competed for teachers with the public schools. The Sunflower County School District was complying with the big federal rules, but making up its own small ones. Proms and dances were canceled altogether to prevent the remaining white students in the public schools from associating with the black students. However, one of the most damaging effects of this move was on the school board. After forty years of complaints, the state combined the Sunflower, Drew, and Indianola school districts, for example. Today In the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, public Coahoma Agricultural High School in the north of the region enrolled 267 black students, 1 Hispanic, and no white students. In Bolivar County, lawyers fought for fifty-one years to keep both Cleveland's two high schools open. Cleveland High School, originally a white school, was by 2015, half and half. By itself, it was a model of success. The town's other high school, East Side had 360 students in 2015, 359 of whom were black. The town had exhausted its legal options. In September 2017, it complied with federal court order and combined the high schools as Cleveland Central High School. Three miles away, Bayou Academy, founded in 1964, is also a single color. Demographic data for Bayou Academy shows that of the 355 students who attended in the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, 4 were black (1%). In Humphreys County to the north, Humphreys Academy had one black student in its 156 student enrollment (2015‚Äì2016).

The company is based in Hackensack, New Jersey. Geographia was founded in the early 1900s by Alexander Gross, a native of Hungary who had established Geographia, Ltd, a commercial map publisher in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the new Geographia initially produced maps of the New York area, expanding into neighboring urban areas. Beginning in the 1940s, Geographia entered a period of rapid growth, introducing world maps and atlases, topical maps detailing aspects of World War II, and a catalog of atlases, street guide books (\\"Red Books\\"), travel guides (\\"Famous Guides\\"), wall maps, and street atlases covering dozens of cities in the United States and Canada. By the late 1950s, Geographia maps had been introduced in Akron, Atlanta, Atlantic City, Baltimore, Binghamton, Birmingham (AL), Buffalo, Charleston (SC), Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Gary, Grand Rapids, Honolulu, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Montreal, New Orleans, Norfolk (VA), Oakland (CA), Oklahoma City, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland (OR), Providence, Richmond (VA), Rochester, St. Louis, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Syracuse, Toledo, Toronto, Washington (DC), Wilmington (DE), among other locales. These folded map titles were housed within a cardstock cover featuring photography of each city's skyline on the front cover, and an alphabetical listing of Geographia's catalog on the rear cover. The maps themselves were large-scale, full color on the detail side, black-and-white on the reverse. Each featured Geographia's characteristic style of cartography, which resembled that of both the forerunner Geographia, Ltd., and the subsequent Geographer's A-Z (also based in the UK) These maps were often distributed by local newsagents, a strategy also employed by a number of Geographia's competitors. By the end of the 1970s, the vast majority of this catalog had gone out of print, and has since become rather collectible. A handful of titles in the northeastern United States remained in print into the 1990s. The company was purchased by the Rand McNally Corporation in the late 1980s, before being re-purchased by its original owners several years later.

On 17 March 2014 Shaw resigned as a member of the Liberal Party in advance of moves to expel him as a member of the party. Charges were brought against Shaw in September 2013, were withdrawn by prosecutors on 3 December, and referred to the Legislative Assembly's Privileges Committee. In May 2014 the Privileges Committee found that Shaw was not diligent in the management of his parliamentary vehicle; that he allowed individuals connected with his private business to use his parliamentary vehicle with little or no supervision; that he enabled the use of his parliamentary vehicle for commercial purposes and his parliamentary fuel card to purchase fuel for his private vehicle; and that he contravened the code of conduct for members as set out in .

Shaw attended Monash University where he attained a Bachelor of Business Accounting in 1988 and entered his own small business as a certified accountant and financial planner.http://www.vic.liberal.org.au/People/StateLowerHouseCandidates/GeoffShaw/tabid/241/Default.aspx Retrieved 2010-12-06 Political career Liberal politician Shaw entered politics at the 2010 Victorian state election where he defeated the incumbent Labor member Alistair Harkness. In April 2011, Shaw wrote to a constituent suggesting \\"his desire to love who he wanted was as illegitimate as a dangerous driver wanting to speed or a child molester wanting to molest\\". The constituent had written to Shaw objecting to the government's renewal of religious organisations' exemption under anti-discrimination legislation. In June 2011 Shaw admitted that he had been charged with assault in 1992 while working as a nightclub bouncer. Premier of Victoria Ted Baillieu asked for an explanation, and Shaw assured him and the Government that he was fined and placed on a good behaviour bond, but no conviction was recorded. In August 2011 Shaw was involved in a roadside fight in his electorate; it was alleged that he was involved in a conversation between a police officer and another driver, with an exchange of words developing into a physical altercation, with injuries to the other driver. In addition to his parliamentary duties, Shaw has run two small businesses including an accounting firm, Geoff Shaw & Partners, in Frankston; and Southern Cross Hardware, a hardware factory in . In May 2012, it was alleged that Shaw's parliamentary car was used for businessrelated to the hardware factory. Shaw claimed his staff had used the vehicle without his knowledge, however several whistleblowers said they remembered Shaw driving the car himself. Baillieu announced he had referred the case to the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly and the Department of Parliamentary Services to examine the use of Shaw's parliamentary entitlements. Geoff Shaw was cleared of charges after a full investigation by the Victorian Police and DPP. Charges were laid after the Labor Party requested the Police to investigate. Independent politician On 6 March 2013 Shaw resigned from the parliamentary Liberal Party, announcing that he would sit in the Legislative Assembly on the crossbenches as an independent politician. In the wake of the release of secret police tapes, Shaw refused to commit to supporting the government if Baillieu remained Premier. Baillieu subsequently resigned as Premier the following day. Ports Minister Denis Napthine succeeded Baillieu as Premier and stated that Shaw would not be endorsed by the Liberal Party as a candidate for the 2014 state election. On 17 September 2013 Victoria Police announced that Shaw had been charged with 23 counts of obtaining financial benefit by deception and one charge of misconduct in public office. On 3 December the Department of Public Prosecutions announced that it had dropped all charges against Shaw. On 15 October 2013 Shaw was involved in a scuffle on the front steps of Parliament House. His arrival for Question Time coincided with a protest by taxi drivers in front of the House. On 28 November 2013 Australian media reported that Premier Napthine had 'secretly assisted' Shaw to draft a Private Member's Bill to change state abortion legislation. Napthine refuted the allegations and stated his Government had no plans to change abortion laws, nor would he support any such change. Shaw reportedly planned to introduce the bill before the 2014 state election. In June 2014 Napthine stated: > \\"...that while I am Premier of this state, I will not allow Mr Shaw to > introduce any legislation seeking to change the abortion laws in Victoria.\\" Following a finding in May 2014 by the Legislative Assembly Privileges Committee that Shaw had contravened the code of conduct for members as set out in section three of the , Shaw told radio station 774 ABC Melbourne on 3 June 2014 that he would support a no confidence motion in the Napthine Government. Initial indications were that both the Labor state opposition and the Napthine government would seek to evict Shaw from the Victorian Parliament due to misuse of parliamentary privilege. On 11 June 2014 following an extended debate, the Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly were asked to discipline Shaw by expelling him from Parliament. Following a division of the assembly that was deadlocked 42 all, with Shaw absent from the floor of the chamber for the debate, the speaker Christine Fyffe used her casting vote to defeat the motion. A subsequent motion was proposed by a Liberal member that \\"...the Member for Frankston be suspended from the service of this House for eleven sitting days.\\" The motion was carried without division. Shaw was required to pay his fine by 2 September or face expulsion.

It is a one-on-one scenario for one player and one gamemaster. The player character is a 7th level Elf. Plot summary Blade of Vengeance is a scenario for a mid-level elf player character. Erystelle of Dorneryll finds the peaceful woodland home of his youth, Emerlas, aflame. His family has been slaughtered by something possessing huge claws and more powerful than the hobgoblins who are still around when he arrives. This is a wilderness quest through a great forest, including encounters with hobgoblins, herbalists, and hill giants. The player character's goal is to defeat a Red Dragon who destroyed the character's home and killed the character's entire family. However, the scenario is about more than just revenge: Erystelle must find a way to recall the great Elven hero Galannor. Publication history O2 Blade of Vengeance was written by Jim Bambra, with art by Jeremy Goodwin (a.k.a. Jes Goodwin). It was published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. It was \\"UK-produced\\". Reception Simon Forrest reviewed the module in Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. Forrest noted that the clues are straightforward and help from the other inhabitants of Emerlas ensures that the player cannot go far wrong. Yet the enemies are not passive but are rather becoming an increasing menace as time goes on. He considered the climax - when Erystelle sneaks into the enemies' camp to kill their leader - to be the scenario's weakest point, according to Forrest, lacking in \\"originality and atmosphere\\". Nevertheless, Forrest declared this to be \\"a splendid module\\", praising the artwork and maps as well as the clear layout and ease- of-use. Forrest lauded the well-developed and consistent atmosphere of the scenario and thought it would be \\"fascinating\\" for inexperienced players and \\"pleasant enough\\" for the more demanding.

During the Napoleonic Wars he rose in rank to command a division. He was accidentally killed in 1808 while on campaign in Spain. His surname is one of the Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe. Early career Born in Paris, Malher enlisted in the French army. During the War of the First Coalition, he became a colonel in 1794. He received promotion to general of brigade in 1799 and to general of division in August 1803. At the latter date, he commanded the 2nd subdivision of the 13th Military Division, headquartered in Rennes. Napoleonic Wars 1805 When Emperor Napoleon I of France's Grande Arm√©e moved against Habsburg Austria during the War of the Third Coalition, Malher commanded the 3rd Division in Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps. His 8,000-man division included six battalions of the 27th, 50th, and 59th Line Infantry Regiments and three battalions of the 27th Light Infantry Regiment, plus six cannons. His subordinates were Generals of Brigade Mathieu Delabass√©Smith, 203 and Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet.Kagan, 407 map On 8 October, the VI Corps marched to Giengen, northwest of Ulm.Kagan, 396 map The following day, Ney ordered Malher to move south and seize the bridges over the Danube near G√ºnzburg. To accomplish this task, Malher formed three columns. The western column under Etienne Nicolas Lefol aimed for the bridge at Leipheim. This force gave up after following a road that ended in a marsh.Kagan, 406 The 59th Regiment formed the eastern column, which was directed toward a bridge on the east side of G√ºnzburg. The central column, which contained most of three regiments, marched straight at G√ºnzburg. These troops collided with a force of Tyrolean jagers under Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr√© to start the Battle of G√ºnzburg.Kagan, 408 Alarmed by the French, the defenders of G√ºnzburg destroyed all the bridges. Cut off, d'Aspr√© surrendered with 200 jagers and two cannons. Malher tried to rebuild the two bridges at G√ºnzburg but was forced to give up under the intense fire of 20 cannons and the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment # 3. Later that day, the Austrian commander Karl Mack von Lieberich ordered the bridge on the eastern outskirts of the town to be reconstructed by Ignaz Gyulai. As soon as Gyulai's men rebuilt the span, the 59th belatedly appeared and rushed the bridge.Kagan, 409 Though outnumbered three-to-one, the attack led by Delabass√© crashed through Gyulai's defenses and captured the span. The 59th deployed in square formation to repel the Austrian cavalry charges that followed. Malher moved the rest of his division to support the success and the French troops held the bridge against Austrian counterattacks.Thiers, 101 Mack retreated to Ulm on 10 October, conceding victory to the French. On 13 October, Malher clashed with an Austrian force led by Johann Laudon at the Elchingen bridge.Kagan, 424 The next day, he led his troops at the Battle of Elchingen, but his division was only lightly engaged.Kagan, 428 After the successful conclusion of the Ulm Campaign, Napoleon sent the divisions of Malher and Louis Henri Loison of Ney's corps to the County of Tyrol. On 4 November, the Austrians defeated Ney's attacks at Scharnitz with heavy losses. However, on the same day the French wiped out a second Austrian force at Leutasch. Ney went on to capture Innsbruck the following day.Smith, 211 1808 On 30 November 1807, a French army occupied Lisbon in the Kingdom of Portugal. It had been allowed to cross the Kingdom of Spain by agreement and Spanish forces occupied parts of Portugal.Glover, 45-46 But Napoleon also plotted to add Spain to his empire by replacing the unpopular regime of King Charles IV of Spain. On the pretext of supporting the occupation force in Portugal, 75,000 French troops crossed into Spain in early 1808 and took over key strategic locations.Glover, 47-48 On 13 March, Malher was accidentally killed during a military exercise in Valladolid.

He was the founder and lead vocals of the rock band No. 43 Baojia Street (named after the street address of the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing). He also composed the music for Wang Xiaoshuai's 2001 film Beijing Bicycle. After two albums No. 43 Baojia Street (1997) and No. 43 Baojia Street 2 (1998), he signed a solo contract with Warner Music Beijing Co., Ltd. The third album Fireworks (2000) was the beginning of his solo career. With a number of songs like Flying Higher (È£ûÂæóÊõ¥È´ò) (2004), and Blooming Life (ÊÄíÊîæÁöÑÁîüÂëΩ) (2005) on his following albums, Wang Feng entered the media spotlight and became popular in China. His 2009 album Belief Flies in the Wind won him an award as the Most Popular Male Singer in China at the Channel V's 14th Chinese Music Awards. He is also a coach on The Voice of China, and Sing! China, both TV shows which helped him gain immense popularity. Early life Wang Feng was born in Beijing to a musicians' family. Under his father's suggestion, Wang started practicing violin when he was five years old. He attended the middle school attached to the Central Conservatory of Music at the age of eleven. Wang did not understand the purpose of playing violin, or why he had to stay home practising while other kids of his age could play outside. At the age of 14, for the first time in his life, Wang realized the beauty of music through a piece composed by Tchaikovsky. After that experience, Wang decided to pursue music for the rest of his life. By the age of 17 Wang started listening to Rock music. Wang studied in the Central Conservatory of Music majoring in violin and viola. In his college years Wang joined the Chinese Youth Orchestra and performed overseas. In his senior year in college (1994), Wang and his friends formed the band No. 43 Baojia Street. Career  With No. 43 Baojia Street  Wang Feng and the band No. 43 Baojia Street (È≤çÂÆ∂Ë°ó43Âè∑) released their first album in 1997, three years after it was formed. During these three years the band practiced in a basement in the college and performed in local clubs and bars. To comply with his father's will and to have a stable income, Wang took the offer of the vice concertmaster of the National Ballet of China Symphony Orchestra. However Wang quit the job after a year even with a promotion of the concertmaster position, and put himself completely into Rock music. In the beginning, the band was sponsored by \\"Xiao Wei\\" (nickname), an alumnus of the Central Conservatory of Music. Xiao Wei's sponsorship allowed the band to practice and perform. They gradually built up their reputation in Beijing, which led the band to a record deal from Beijing Jingwen Record Co., Ltd on 31 May 1997. The band was not profitable under Xiao Wei's sponsorship. Wang couldn't even pay his rent at that time. The record deal with Beijing Jingwen Record was an opportunity for the band to officially enter the music business and to solve the money issue. Xiao Wei understood the benefit of the deal for Wang Feng and the whole band. He terminated the sponsorship himself and left Beijing. Later that year the band made their first studio album, No. 43 Baojia Street (1997). This album included songs like \\"Little Bird\\" and \\"Good Night Beijing\\", which became famous afterwards. One year later the band made their second album, No. 43 Baojia Street 2 ‚Äì Storm Approaching (1998). While the albums were sold in the market, the economic issue of the band and Wang himself did not resolve. In other words, the band was not making a profit. Wang decided to terminate the contract with Beijing Jingwen Record. In 2000, the Warner Music Beijing Co., Ltd found Wang Feng and offered him a record deal but not the whole band. Wang signed the contract and put out the album Fireworks' (2000) in the same year. The songs from this album were made before the band broke up..  Solo years  With Warner Music and Feng Sheng Music  During his years with Warner Music, Wang had the boost of his career. Three albums were made, including Fireworks (2000), Love is a Happy Bullet (2002), and Crying while Smiling (2004). The song Flying Higher, which became very popular in China after release, was included in the album Crying while Smiling. Wang also took care of the entire soundtrack of the movie Beijing Bicycle (2001). In July 2005, Wang ended the five-year contract with Warner Music and started his own independent record label \\"Feng Sheng Music\\" (Feng Sheng is the Chinese translation for Feng's voice). In the same year, Wang released his fourth studio album \\"Blooming Life\\" (2005). The song Blooming life, same as the name of the album, became famous quickly after the album was released and became the most downloaded ringtones in some regions in China. In the same album, Wang included another two famous patriotic pieces, Our Dream („ÄäÊàë‰ª¨ÁöÑÊ¢¶„Äã) and I Love You, China („ÄäÊàëÁà±‰Ω†Ôºå‰∏≠ÂõΩ„Äã). Our Dream became the Beijing Olympic Top 10 Golden Songs; I Love You, China was considered a gift for the success of Shenzhou 6, the second human spaceflight of the People's Republic of China. In 2006 Wang was awarded the Pepsi Chart \\"Best Male Singer in China\\".  With Music Nation Group  In May 2007, Wang made a new record deal with the Hong Kong media company MusicNationGroup. One month later, Wang released his fifth studio album Brave Heart (2007). Wang claimed to be very satisfied with his work in this album, however one of the tracks was forced to be taken out by the authority. During the time the album was released, some people on the Internet claimed that the hit song Brave Heart was a copy of the song Crazy from the Canadian pop-punk band Simple Plan. Wang's response was, \\"I do not need to copy other people's work. It's just as simple as that. I do not need to do that at all.\\" In 2009, after two years since the last album, Wang came back with the Belief Flies in the Wind (2009). The album brought Wang many awards. The song In Spring became No.1 on the 23rd of the Chinese Music Chart. In September, the song Light took the No.1 place again on the 32nd of the Chinese Music Chart. On 12 Nov., the song When I Miss You won the No.1 on the 42nd of the Chinese Music Chart. On the 9th Global Chinese Music Awards, the song In Spring won the Best Lyrics award. Wang Feng himself won the Best Producer, and the album Belief Flies in the Wind won the Best Album. In an interview with Changjiang Business Journal, Wang claimed that \\"This album is meant to let everyone to understand the true rock music. It's not about what the majority like or what's popular. I'm making mainstream rock music, and that's what I stand for.\\"  With Rock Forward  In 2011, after being signed to Rock Forward Entertainment, Wang Feng released Life Asks for Nothing, the first ever double album in Chinese rock history, which phenomenally topped a wide variety of charts and earned him nationwide critical acclaims on the major Chinese music awards. The same year Wang Feng became the first ever Chinese artist who held concerts in grand stadiums twice a year, which again has proved that he is one of very few Chinese rock musicians who enjoy commercial success and mainstream recognition without discarding the famously rebellious roots. His uncompromisingly keen passion for life and independent spirit have radically altered the parameters of Chinese rock scene and have left a deep mark on Chinese popular culture for him as the true inspiring voice of his generation. In 2013, Wang Feng became a coach in The Voice of China Season 2, with Na Ying, Harlem Yu, and A-Mei Zhang. He continued to be a coach even till Season 4. In 2016, Wang Feng became a coach in the first season of the rebranded Sing! China, where he became the winning mentor courtesy of Jiang Dunhao, who won the series. He did not return for another season in season 2 the following year. In 2018, Wang Feng was one of the seven first-round singers taking part in the sixth season of Hunan Television's singing competition Singer (which was previously named I Am a Singer). He made it to the finals and finished third, behind Hua Chenyu and winner Jessie J.

It is a rare species of succulent plant, native to a few high, inaccessible mountain peaks in the Fynbos habitat of Western Cape, South Africa.Victor, J.E. 2009. Aloe haemanthifolia A.Berger & Marloth. National Assessment: Red List of South African Plants v. 2011 Description Kumara haemanthifolia is a small bunched plant, related to aloes, with greyish-green, tongue-shaped leaves that grow in a fan shape, similar to its sister species Kumara plicatilis, the fan-aloe. In fact, it looks very much like a diminutive, stemless form of the tree-like Kumara plicatilis. Its compact ranks of leaves are oblong and grey-green in colour, with bright red margins.Glen, H.F. and Craib, C. 1993. Aloe haemanthifolia. Flowering Plants of Africa 52(2):t. 2063. Small and close to the ground, it often escapes notice or is mistaken for a lily. In fact, its name \\"haemanthifolia\\" was given because of its resemblance to the popular Haemanthus bulbs.http://www.succulents.co.za/aloes/stemless-aloes/aloe- haemanthifolia.phphttp://desert-plants.blogspot.com/2009/06/aloe- haemanthifolia.html It produces bright scarlet flowers at the end of winter (September up until November in its natural habitat). Kumara haemanthifolia is naturally restricted to high mountain tops, in a tiny corner of the Western Cape. Distribution Its natural range also nearly matches that of Kumara plicatilis (being the mountainous area from Stellenbosch through to Ceres) but Kumara haemanthifolia occurs further up on the mountain peaks than its larger sister species. The plant seems to prefer cold south-facing slopes with heavy winter rainfall. It grows in sheltered cracks in sandstone ridges, forming dense clumps. Tucked inside crevices in its natural habitat it is very hardy - surviving both frost and fire. It has a large, strong root stock - meaning that the plant can re-sprout again, even after all of the plant above ground has been totally destroyed by veld fire. Cultivation It is a very difficult plant to cultivate, and it usually soon dies if planted outside of its natural habitat.

The organisation currently has a presence in over 20 cities throughout 5 continents, and had 2000 participants in 2017.  History   Origins  Random Hacks of Kindness grew out of an industry panel discussion at the first Crisis camp Bar Camp in Washington, D.C. in June 2009. Panel attendees included Patrick Svenburg of Microsoft, Phil Dixon and Jeff Martinhttp://crisiscampdc.ning.com/profile/JefferyMartin of Google and Jeremy JohnstoneCrisiscampdc.ning.com of Yahoo!. They agreed to use their developer communities to create solutions that will affect disaster response, risk reduction and recovery. The idea was for a \\"hackathon\\" with developers producing open source solutions. The World Bank's Disaster Risk Reduction Unit (Stuart Gill) and NASA's Open Government team (Robbie Schingler) joined the partnership and these \\"founding partners\\" (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, NASA and the World Bank) decided on the name \\"Random Hacks of Kindness\\" for their first event. An innovation incubator in the area of sustainable development, SecondMusesecondmuse.com acts as \\"operational lead\\" for Random Hacks of Kindness, coordinating global volunteer efforts, facilitating collaborative partnerships, and managing communications and branding.  2009: RHoK 0  The first Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK 0) was held at the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, California on November 12‚Äì14, 2009.http://pressroom.rhok.org/press-releases FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate gave the keynote and made a call to action to the developers to apply their creativity to the challenges and featured hacks. The first RHoK event is known as RHoK 0 after 0-based array indexing in computer programming. Featured projects were * I'm OK * Tweak the Tweet (not a code \\"hack\\", but an edit/republish \\"hack\\") * Break Glass Tweak the Tweet was used during the Haiti earthquake response in January 2010  2010: RHoK 1.0 and 2.0  The second RHoK event was held at the Microsoft Chevy Chase offices in Washington DC on June 4‚Äì6, 2010. Crisis Commons hosted a Crisis Camp co-located. The reception for RHoK 1.0 was held at the US State Department, and was blogged by Aneesh Chopra, the United States Chief Technology Officer. While the Washington, DC RHoK was the \\"main stage\\", several other locations hosted satellite events at the same time, including Oxford England, Jakarta Indonesia, Sydney Australia, Nairobi Kenya, S√£o Paulo Brazil, and Santiago Chile.fd The \\"winning\\" hack at the Washington DC event was a new interface on CHASM (Combined Hydrology and Stability Model), a system to make landslide predictions. CHASM continues to be developed and is supported by groups including the World Bank. The third Random Hacks of Kindness was held on December 4 and 5, 2010, in 21 cities on 5 continents.  2011 - 2013: RHoK 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0  The fourth Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK 3.0) was held in 2011 in the cities of: Buenos Aires, Toronto, Nairobi, Lusaka, Bogota, San Pablo, Singapore, Tel Aviv, Birmingham, M√©xico DF, Ju√°rez, Atlanta, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. The most active city to be participant was Buenos Aires, which was held in the Globant office and the participants included Guibert Englebienne (CTO of Globant) and Alejandro Pablo Tkachuk (ex-Globant and now CTO of Calculistik).http://www.apertura.com/historico/Hackear-para- ayudar-20110301-0011.html RHoK 3.0 was held twice in 2012: On the 3‚Äì4 June and again on the 1‚Äì2 December. This saw multiple cities come into play and a huge turnaround of developers from all over the world including Cape Town. The focus of the hackathon was toilets and/or sanitation. The sixth global hackathon (RHoK 4.0) was also a major success. It was held twice in 2013 (in June and in December). UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon gave the keynote speech at New York. Also speaking at NYC were NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, Google vice president for research Alfred Spector, Microsoft Director Patrick Svenburg, Parsons The New School for Design Dean Joel Towers and UN Global Pulse director, Robert Kirkpatrick.  2014 - 2016  2014 and 2015 saw the organisation shrink as the rhok.org website went down, cutting off global coordination and events in a number of cities ceased to be held. However, a new website was created at the end of 2016 at rhok.cc, and communities continued to thrive in multiple cities in India and Australia, as well as Ottawa and Berlin. RHoK Jnr, an independent effort for students in the United States, also continued to thrive, holding 7 events in 2016.  2017 - 2018  In 2017 rebuilding of the global community continued, and connections with all the active RHoK communities around the world were reestablished. The global community grow considerably, with events over 6 cities in Australia and 3 in India, as well as events in Ottawa, Berlin, Washington DC, Pretoria, and Ghana.

The ages of the athletes stretch from age six to twenty six. Their mission is to \\"To champion the pursuit of excellence in the international sport of synchronized swimming.\\" The club, a non-profit, member supported team creates nationally ranked synchronized swimmers of all ages. The Aquamaids have produced over 60% of all Olympic Synchronized Swimmers representing the United States since the sport became an Olympic event in 1984.  History  In 1964, the club was founded by Wilbur Luick. He hired Kay Vilen as the first head coach. She was praised for her expertise and knowledge on the sport. She had the big ideas and interesting techniques that make the Aquamaids famous today. The Aquamaids were able to attract transfers from other established clubs, including the Howel Swim Club of Walnut Creek, the Athens Club of Oakland, CA, and the Riverside Aquettes. They soon became a leading contender, taking the titles of Solo Champions, Duet Champions, and Team Champions at the Senior and Junior National levels on numerous occasions. After Vilen's death in 1976, the two top swimmers at the time, Gail Johnson and Pam Albin Edwards took over as head coaches, and the club continued to thrive.Bean, Dawn Pawson Bean. Synchronized Swimming: An American History. McFarland Company Inc. Publishers, Jefferson (North Carolina, USA), 2005. In 1984, Chris Carver was appointed head coach. Even with no history of participating in the actual sport, her innovative choreography and her great attention to detail is what makes the Aquamaids national champions. This statement is not exactly true. In an interview with the much honored Olympic Coach, she revealed that she had been introduced to synchronized swimming by her swim club coach when she was in junior high school in Palo Alto, California. Then she took part in competitions for the Palo Alto High School District. This was in the early 1950s when the sport was in its infancy and was being made popular by the Hollywood water extravaganza movies of the athlete and movie star Esther Williams. Miss Williams became her inspiration in her choreography development and aqua presentations. In addition, Mrs. Carver had joined the Aquamaids on a part-time basis in 1980, coaching the ten-and-under team for four years. Plus, she had come out of retirement the year before from coaching at her local cabana club. For twelve consecutive summers she had coached the Cloverdale Cabana Dolphinettes water ballet team, presenting to the public spectacular performances each year. It was working with this community where Mrs. Carver developed her attention to detail and imaginative water choreography and swimming routines that have been the backbone of her success with the Aquamaids. She owes much of that success to the Cloverdale Cabana swimmers and their families, she said. Chris had a history major diploma from San Jose State and also had a classical music background, for she had played the violin with the Junior Symphony. There is now a pictorial album and written record of Mrs. Carver's early career in synchronized swimming that can be seen upon request at the California Room of the San Jose State University Library. There, one can see her coaching success of starting with only eleven girls in her shows to casts of over forty swimmers, creating and perfecting her talent of musical aqua performances. Her expertise developed as she created routines for well known musical productions such as PETER PAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, SLEEPING BEAUTY, AND THE NUTCRACKER, as well as \\"variety/musical\\" shows such as PURE IMAGINATION. Check it out. She certainly had had twelve years of experience in coaching young swimmers participate in the sport in creations of beauty on the water. She has received the \\"Coach of the Year\\" award every year for the past fourteen years. In 2000, Carver was appointed the head coach of the 2000 Summer Olympic Synchronized Swim Team. The nine-member team consisted of seven Aquamaids. The team consisted of Carrie Barton, Anna Kozlova, Bridget Finn, Kristina Lum, Elicia Marshall, Tuesday Middaugh, and Kim Wurtzel. The duet of Anna Kozlova and Tuesday Middaugh also competed. The team came close to a medal, placing fourth. The duet didn't place as well as the team did. In 2003, Carver and her team were determined as ever before to become a successful team. After three years of training, the same team who competed in the 2000 Olympics competed in the 2003 Pan-American Games. Where the team took a gold medal, and the duet of Anna Kozlova and Tuesday Middaugh took home a gold medal as well. In 2004, the first two athletes to compete on the US synchronized swimming team were announced. It was the freshly created duet of Anna Kozlova and Alison Bartosik. For the second year in a row, the duet that was representing the US consisted of two Aquamaids. Later the team added five more Aquamaids, and two swimmers that were not from the team. The five other Aqumaids were, Tammy Crow, Becky Jasontek, Sara Lowe, Lauren McFall and Kendra Zanotto. The team places third and was rewarded and bronze medal. This was the first year that the US got a metal since 1996. Anna Kozlova and Alison Bartosik placed third, receiving a bronze medal as well. Kozlova and Bartosik were among only twenty- two other athletes that had multiple metals. In 2005, Carver stepped down as National Training Coach after twenty-five years to focus fully on the Aquamaids. The club continues to host swimmers from all over the world. They have recruited swimmers from Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Israel, Italy, Russia, Scotland, Switzerland, France, Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa.  Programs   The Full Time Competitive Program  This program meets full time in that the swimmers practice daily, year round. This program places swimmers on a nationally or internationally ranked track. The level of ability ranges from the basic to the most elite level of synchronized swimming. The program accepts swimmers as young as six. The swimmers advance through the full time competitive program based on their age and abilities. The beginning of training starts with the swimmer learning the very basics of synchronized swimming. This includes learning to count music, sculling, beginning figures, land drilling and learning routines.  Novice/Intermediate Part Time Competitive Program  This program meets part time, two to three times a week for 10 months. The athletes in this program compete in local competitions during the Sept to June season in the Novice and Intermediate categories. The Novice/Intermediate athletes are given the opportunity to optionally participate in the annual (July) summer California State Games competition in San Diego. Every year, the Aquamaids sends athletes from the Novice/Intermediate teams to compete with others from all over California in a weekend long event which includes a spectacular parade of athletes opening ceremony. The 'State Games' is a United States Olympic Committee Amateur grassroots games. Although this program does not participate in high level 'National' or 'International' competitions, the exposure to synchronized swimming and learning to compete can lead to continued success on college and university teams. There are many (non varsity) colleges and universities throughout the United States who have Novice/Intermediate competitive teams and welcomes Aquamaids with this level into their respective synchronized swimming programs. The younger 11 and under athletes in the novice program are considered developmental and are prepared for the regular full time high competitive program if they opt to make that transition. The athletes on the Intermediate teams, usually 12 to 17 years old, continue to learn more advanced synchronized swimming techniques throughout the season at a slower pace than the high competitive teams. The Novice/Intermediate program home pool is currently at Los Gatos High School.  Recreational Programs  The Recreational program consists of spring, summer and part time training. The Spring program is considered a one-week 'Spring Camp' program where swimmers can *Try* synchronized swimming in preparation for a full 2 week 'Sync into Summer' camp program offered at various South Bay locations from June through August, where they will learn the basics and practice routines as well as have fun and decide if the full time or part time competitive programs are for them. The Aquamaids also have a part time (Tues/Thurs) program in Menlo Park, which is beginner developmental training and participates in some local competitions.

He was the director of the Pasteur Institute at the University of Michigan from 1903 to 1904. He worked in private practice in Detroit as the city's first pediatrician starting in 1905. He worked with the Babies' Milk Fund and helped to reduce Detroit's high infant mortality rate in the 1900s and 1910s. During World War I, Cooley went to France as the assistant chief of the Children's Bureau of the American Red Cross. He was decorated in 1924 with the cross of the Legion of Honor for his work in France. From 1921 to 1941, Cooley was the head of pediatric service at Children's Hospital of Michigan. Cooley gained acclaim for his scientific work in the field of pediatric hematology and is principally remembered for his discovery of, and research into, a form of childhood anemia that became known as Cooley's anemia. Cooley was also a professor at the Wayne University College of Medicine from 1936 to 1941. Early years Cooley was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of Thomas McIntyre Cooley, a noted legal scholar. While Cooley was a boy, his father served variously as a professor and dean of the University of Michigan Law School, an Associate Justice and Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court, and as the first chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Cooley attended the Ann Arbor public schools and graduated from Ann Arbor High School. He enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1891 and Doctor of Medicine degree in 1895. After receiving his medical degree, Cooley was an intern at the Boston City Hospital from 1895 to 1897. He returned to the University of Michigan as an instructor of hygiene from 1898 to 1900. In 1900, he left Michigan to study and visit clinics for a year in Germany. In 1902, he returned to Boston City Hospital as a resident physician and also undertook further training in contagious diseases. Medical career Pasteur Institute In 1903, Cooley returned to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor of hygiene, and he was there placed in charge of the Pasteur Institute at the University of Michigan. During 1903 and 1904, Cooley used funding of $2,500 to provide Pasteur treatment to individuals who had been, or were believed to have been, infected with rabies.Journal of the American Medical, vol. 40, at p. 924. In 1904, Cooley published a report detailing the results of providing 38 patients with the Pasteur treatment. Of the 38 patients treated, 36 had been bitten by dogs, one by a cat, and one by a horse. In none of the cases did the patient develop rabies. Babies' Milk Fund In 1905, he moved to Detroit where he practiced as a pediatrician. He served as the medical director of the Babies' Milk Fund. His efforts were credited with playing a \\"great role in the reduction of infant deaths from the diarrheal diseases in the early decades of the twentieth century.\\" World War I During World War I, he served as the assistant chief of the Children's Bureau of the American Red Cross in France. During the war, medical and nursing personnel \\"vanished from the cities\\" in France, leaving an absence of care for the civilian population. A population of 400,000 \\"war orphans\\" added to the scope of the problem. After he returned from France in 1919, the Detroit Free Press published a full-page story on Cooley's efforts under the headline, \\"CHILDREN OF FRANCE ARE FOREVER HIS DEBTOR.\\" The Free Press wrote: > Few persons realize that it was a modest, slow speaking Detroit doctor who > was in a great measure responsible for much of the work that was done for > those children of France. This unostentatious man is Dr. Thomas B. Cooley, > child specialist of note. He returned from France scarcely a month ago and > immediately put off his togs of khaki which bore a major's insignia and > settled back into private life and practice as simply as if he had but come > home from a summer vacation. In addition to providing the children of France with medical care, the Children's Bureau also established camps, barracks and temporary hospitals. Cooley's projects in France included the establishment of a school of children's public health, transformation of the Edith Cavell hospital from a military hospital to a pediatric hospital, and creation of a model boarding home to house the war orphans. In the 19th arrondissement of Paris, the poorest district in the city, Cooley led a concentrated effort to deliver services to the children. He recalled, > The first thing that was necessary for us to do was to open dispensaries. > ... But still there was that shortage of nurses. It wasn't enough to have > children brought to the dispensary when they were taken back to unsanitary > homes, homes where mothers failed to understand even the first elements of > child care and feeding. We needed some agency which would go into the home > to see that the physician's instructions were carried out in the best > possible manner. Thus we hit upon the plan of training French women as > visiting housekeepers. Cooley established a training school for the visiting housekeepers in a vacant house owned by a Protestant church in Paris. There, Cooley oversaw the training of the women in the basic elements of hygiene, dietetics and sanitation. The Children's Bureau also opened a pre-natal clinics where classes were taught in dietetics and English, and a kindergarten opened. Cooley received the cross of the Legion of Honour in 1924 from the government of France. Hematology and Cooley's anemia In 1921, after returning from France, Cooley became the head of pediatric service at the Children's Hospital of Michigan, a position he held for 20 years. Cooley developed a sub-specialty in hematology and childhood anemias. Cooley is most remembered for his findings with respect to a form of childhood anemia involving peculiar bone changes. Cooley noted similarities in appearance and clinical course of four children of Greek and Italian ancestry. The children had severe anemia combined with massive hepatosplenomegaly, bone deformities and severe growth retardation. Cooley called the disorder \\"erythroblastic anemia,\\" but it became popularly known as Cooley's anemia. Cooley presented his findings to the American Pediatric Society in 1925.W. W. Zuelzer, Thomas B Cooley (1871-1945), Pediatric profiles, Borden S. Veeder, editor (The CV Mosby Co, 1957). The American Journal of Diseases of Children called Cooley's work \\"one of the outstanding contributions to hematology by an American.\\" In their treatise on hematology of infancy and childhood, Nathan & Oski wrote: \\"More lasting and far more important, of course, was the contribution made to pediatric hematology ‚Äì and indeed to medical science as a whole ‚Äì by Thomas B. Cooley of Detroit in 1925, when he salvaged from this wastebasket the distinct entity known as thalassemia.\\"Nathan and Oski, p. 5. In 1936, Cooley also became a professor of pediatrics at the Wayne State University College of Medicine. He was also a charter member of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a member of the American Pediatric Society; he served as president of both organizations. In 1941, at age 70, Cooley became the emeritus chief of pediatric service at Children's Hospital and an emeritus professor at Wayne State. Cooley was described as an articulate, well educated, highly intelligent man who read four languages and \\"maintained a global correspondence.\\" He undertook his work without formal training in hematology and with minimal equipment: > His equipment consisted of a monocular microscope of ancient vintage, a > staining rack, a rather small card file, and -- in an otherwise vacant room > upstairs intended for the affairs of the Child Research Council of the > American Academy of Pediatrics -- a couch on which he took siestas and did > much of his thinking.Nathan and Orski, p. 6. Nathan & Oski summarized Cooley's approach and influence: > Cooley's influence extended well beyond the field of hematology. ... He was > one of the founders of the Academy of Pediatrics and, long before the time > was ripe, saw the role of pediatrics in terms of preventative medicine. > Politically he was a liberal, scientifically a radical, personally a > patrician. Combined with a rather haughty expression, an irrepressible wit, > and an utter lack of reverence for established authority, these traits were > bound to earn him enmities on the part of the town and gown alike, but his > enemies respected him and his friends admired him. He was well ahead of his > time, a lucid thinker and a giant in the history of pediatric hematology. Family and death Cooley was married to Abigail Hubbard in December 1903.Burke A. Hinsdale and Isaac Newton Demmon, History of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1906), pp. 354. The couple had a daughter, Emily Holland Cooley, and a son, Thomas McIntyre Cooley II. Cooley lived in a tasteful house in Detroit's Indian Village neighborhood and owned a summer cottage on the coast of Maine. Cooley died in October 1945 in Bangor, Maine.

Pre-history The London suburb of Thornton Heath sits at the base of the southern slopes of the Norwood Hills in a glacial valley which was formed during the last ice age. The river Graveney, a tributary of the river Wandle, is the remnant of the original waterway. Pre- Roman, Roman, and Saxon history Signs of a Neolithic settlement, including flint axe-heads, were discovered and recorded in the area now known as Thornton Heath Pond during 19th century excavations to build a tram terminus for the developing suburb. The London to Sussex road was originally a Roman construction which passed via Thornton Heath to Croydon along a section still called Roman Way. Parts of the original structure were said to have been visible close to the Thornton Heath area as late as 1800. Another Roman road, from a settlement two miles (3 km) to the west joined at the horse-pond in west Thornton Heath, and this became a junction around which the early hamlet grew. When Thornton Heath High Street was being laid in the 19th century, to the east of the Pond area, hoards of coins were found spanning the Roman occupation of the area from 69 to 138 AD. There is no other record of human habitation in the Roman period. An ancient matrix for suburban growth can be found in Thornton Heath's old byways. The four lanes that crisscrossed the valley in Saxon times survived to form principal routes of ribbon development in the 19th century, their names surviving the passage of time: Green Lane, Whitehorse Lane, Colliers Water Lane, and Bensham Lane. A hoard of Saxon, Frankish and oriental coins was found by navvies cutting the railway in the 1860s. Perhaps this was an indication of early commerce‚Ä¶ or crime. These discoveries demonstrate how urban development can reflect a continuing cycle of settlement. Medieval history Bensham Lane retains the area's ancient name, \\"Benchesham\\", the history of which had repercussions on the 19th-century suburb. In the medieval era it was one of seven boroughs paying tribute to the See of Canterbury at Croydon. The first mention of it comes shortly after the Norman conquest when the tithes of Benchesham were passed to Rochester Monastery. On at least two occasions the monks of Rochester had to prove it belonged to them and not to their Kentish rivals. Confirmation was made in a charter of 1145 which ended: \\"Those who presume to tamper with this charter shall suffer eternal damnation with the traitor Judas\\", and again in 1199, when it was said to have belonged to the monks: \\"for a very long time\\". With further claims and disputes over the years, the area was much valued, and Benchesham belonged to a line of illustrious owners, including a knight of the garter, a lord mayor of London, two Bishops of London, an Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry V, Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I. There was a manor house at Benchescham, and the road that led from the original gate is still called Bensham Manor Road, but there are no records of feudal courts or other privileges. In the late 13th century Benchescham was divided into northern and southern districts (possibly because the monks of Rochester had given up their claim, or possibly owing to a local stand-off during the Barons Wars in 1264). North Benchescham became \\"Northborough\\" and then Norbury (some local histories claim the name derives from being the \\"north borough of Croydon\\" when actually it is from its situation as the north part of the borough of Benchescham, i.e., old Thornton Heath). Norbury was bought by the powerful Carew family in whose possession it remained for over 500 years (except for a short time in the 16th century when Nicholas Carew was executed and the land seized by Henry VIII). While the rest of the district was being developed in the 19th century, the Carew land remained farmland. The southern part of the borough (for a while known as Suthbenchesham) was leased to Walter Whitehorse, shield bearer to Edward III and Parliament's first \\"Black Rod\\". Bensham Manor was renamed Whitehorse Manor in his honour, and is remembered today in Whitehorse Manor School, which stands on the site. In 1511, there is the first mention of a tract of common land forming the southernmost part of Norbury and extended along the Sussex road to the Pond: \\"Thornton Heathe\\". The heath itself consisted of 36 acres (146,000 m2): this was the common grazing land for the manor of Norbury. 17th and 18th century history Until the arrival of the railway, Thornton Heath was focused on an area 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south west of the manor house, at the locality on the main Sussex road A23 known as Thornton Heath Pond. Between the manor house and Pond was an isolated farmhouse. Eventually it would become the site for the railway station and the main expansion hub. The curious history of this farmhouse seems to reflect the two principal activities that dirtied the hands of the locals in the early modern period: coal and crime. The colliers of this area burnt wood from the Norwood Hills in kilns cooled by water from the river Graveney which runs through the district. It was a main supply of charcoal to London (when the railway station first opened it was named Colliers Water). Smoke and high prices made the Thornton Heath colliers unpopular. With their dark complexions, they were often portrayed in the popular imagination as the devil incarnate. The first recorded inhabitant of the farmhouse was the aptly named Frank Grimes, who caricatured as Grim, became a regular in Restoration theatre. It is said his grave was still visible in the 1890s, before the farm and the manor house were demolished in the High Street's widening scheme. In the 18th century, the farmhouse became known as Dick Turpin's cottage, as the most notorious of all highwaymen is said to have lived here as a guest of his aunt. The cottage was subsequently believed to have been in the possession of the infamous John Gilpin, subject of a ballad by Cowper. The Turpin legend reflected the lawless nature of the area at the time, which attracted all manner of banditry. However, retribution wasn't far away. The plot of land at the Pond became known as Hangman's Acre. Immense gallows loomed on John Ogilby's Britannia maps of 1675, and were still present in a later edition in 1731. Indeed, the district appears simply as \\"Gallows Green\\" on maps from 1690 to 1724. A coaching inn was built here in the mid-18th century, also providing a court and cells. Croydon Parish records note the executions: \\"highwayman, executed Aug 14, 1720\\"; \\"six highwaymen, all hanged Mar 31, 1722\\"; \\"four highwaymen, all hanged Apr 27, 1723\\". There were fortunates too, a local contemporary news report notes: \\"a man escaped death when the noose broke and he ran off through Thornton Heath\\". Around the coaching inn a small hamlet developed, but it was isolated and there was no indication of any further development. So the pre-19th-century picture of Thornton Heath is of a desolate valley with lonely farmsteads sheltering desperate outlaws, with the hangman's noose the only recognised authority. The 18th century also saw the beginning of a classic form of suburban ribbon development in south London. Continuous avenues of housing which characterised main roads and provided the main communications link between city and suburb. Referred to in this period by Daniel Defoe as a \\"monster\\", London expanded along the Sussex road (now the A23), swallowing the villages of Kennington, Brixton and Streatham in the process. Thornton Heath lay in its path as it made the push towards Croydon: \\"large and full of citizens from London, which makes it so populous.\\" To Thornton Heath's advantage was its position on the Sussex road. Early improvements to this route made full use of the gravel pits in the Thornton Heath area. In 1619 Sir William Walters left land near Thornton Heath to provide gravel to mend the ways between London and Croydon. Defoe wrote in the 1720s: \\"the great Sussex road, which was formerly insufferably bad, is now become admirably good; and this is done at so great an expense, that they told me at Strettham, that 1 mile between the two next bridges south of that town (Thornton Heath) cost a thousand pounds repairing‚Ä¶ the materials are very near hand, and very good all the way to Croydon\\". Early 19th-century development Generally, growth and expansion was limited in Thornton Heath for three reasons. Firstly, the 1797 enclosures meant that just 23 persons between them owned 300 workable plots, and the Carews retained almost a quarter of the farmland. Secondly, the impact of the Industrial Revolution: in 1803, the horse-drawn Surrey Iron Railway opened (the world's first public railway), connecting Croydon with Wandsworth. Six years later the Croydon Canal linked with the Surrey Docks in Rotherhithe. These two man-made avenues bordered Thornton Heath to the west and east respectively, and were physical barriers to expansion. Thirdly, the Norwood hills to the north formed a natural barrier. With Croydon to the south, Thornton Heath was effectively squeezed into just over 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2) of land. Its size and shape limited, but as any further development of Croydon would naturally lean towards London, its future as a suburb inevitable. After the government enforced land enclosures of 1797, the crucial plots in Thornton Heath's future development belonged to John Bennington and Thomas Farley. Bennington had Colliers Water Farm where the station would later develop, and it was his son who was happy to sell to the railway company. Farley, a member of various local boards, owned much of the Pond area. It had been the original intention of the enclosures to divide and rail-in land to improve agricultural yield. However, Farley converted allotments of land and sold them as freehold property. As a result, by 1818, the hamlet around the Pond had become a considerable village containing 68 houses. Little-by-little, the ribbon development along the Sussex road continued to form in short unconnected strands, but towards Croydon rather than London. Referring to this period, J.C. Anderson (1882) estimated that between the Pond and Broad Green were not more than three houses and a handful of cottages. Surrey magistrate Thomas Cole had a number of \\"neat villas\\" here. In the caption to an engraving of one such villa in 1817, this area of Thornton Heath was still described as \\"a rural bijoux\\". In contrast, William Cobbett (Rural Rides; 1830) commented: \\"London to Croydon is as ugly a bit of country as any in England\\". The Highways Surveyors Board controlled Croydon's roads from 1836. The Sussex road was a priority as it came from London. The composer, Samuel Coleridge Taylor, living near the Pond remembered: \\"All the manifold traffic of this main road from London to Brighton rattled and rumbled by with brief intermission all through the 24 hours.\\" But most roads in the Thornton Heath area were not given proper surfaces until development was almost complete. The road from the Pond to the station was not \\"tarmaced\\" until the trams arrived in 1900 when the High Street was also widened. And as late as 1904, Green Lane, the other link between Thornton Heath and Streatham, was still described as: \\"a rural road impassable to vehicles.\\" (1861‚Äì1911) Suburban expansion During the 50-year period 1861‚Äì1911, Thornton Heath saw a complete transformation from isolated rural outpost to integrated metropolitan suburb. Firstly, a new railway station sited in the eastern farmlands enabled that immediate area to evolve around a central point. Then, in the late 19th century, the western part of Thornton Heath, which lay directly on the main London-Sussex road, demonstrated a classic form of suburban ribbon development. In the process, it became the final piece in an urban chain linking two major centres, London and Croydon, completing the greatest metropolitan expansion in the world at that time. Meanwhile, within the district itself, the initial aspiring middle-class enclave was switching to host a working-class population. So Thornton Heath combined elements of growth that have been defined as typically singular by the eminent suburbanologist H. J. Dyos (Victorian Suburb: 1966): railway development alongside ribbon development, a dependency on two urban centres, and working-class enclaves developing alongside middle-class enclaves. There are also other unusual aspects regarding location and space that don't quite fit the generic mould marking it as an exceptional model of suburban development. (1861‚Äì1911) Railway expansion Transport, and the railway in particular, had a huge impact on the development of Thornton Heath. The junction at the Pond was always going to command attention as a development core, due to the level of traffic that passed along the Sussex road. But it was the railway in the eastern district that became the more important catalyst to growth. An act was made in 1837 to drain the Croydon canal and convert the basin into the first proper suburban line from the City. As most of the cutting work was already done, it opened within two years. In 1851, the newly formed London and Brighton railway company planned to link London's West End to this line as part of a new service to the south coast. The most obvious place for a junction with the City's line was about respectively to the north of Croydon and to the east of Thornton Heath, where the existing track split into the Brighton line and the Epsom line. The added advantage here was that a connection would form a commuter arc around south London between the West End and City. As a fairly level landscape is required for traction, and to avoid time-consuming and expensive cuttings, viaducts and tunnels, the most direct route was along the valleys of the Wandle and Graveney, via Wandsworth and Streatham, and straight through the eastern district of Thornton Heath. There was also a long-term objective of the railway company. According to Dyos, as London expanded, empty areas became less risky as an investment proposition. Lines were frequently in advance of their potential traffic, so stations were often planted like seeds, quite literally in fields, to foster growth. The only other station originally built on the line between Victoria and Croydon was at Streatham, and that was also situated in isolated farmland from the Sussex road developments. Dyos said stations were sometimes so off the beaten track that they were given unfamiliar place names. Indeed, Thornton Heath station was originally christened Collier's Water after the local farm, and Streatham Common was originally known as Greyhound Lane. Stations in deserted areas sat like advertisements of things to come. Objections from local inhabitants or authorities were at a minimum and land agents could promote exclusivity. John Bennington, who owned Collier's Water farm where the railway station was built, obviously saw the benefits that the railway line would bring in turning his inherited farmland into prime development plots. Not surprisingly, he was also one of the chief supporters of the railway in local politics. He even wrote a guide-book for prospective migrants: \\"The prettiest branch of railway for suburban views outside the metropolis\\". It was published by the investment company behind the London and Brighton railway. It is quite possible that he persuaded them to name the station after his farm. If the railway company's long-term strategy was a risk, it paid off in Thornton Heath. The area around the station blossomed and within ten years was larger and more of an attraction than the development along the Sussex road. The main reason for success was a combination of cheap tickets and location. The Cheap Trains Act instituted in 1883 provided \\"workmen's tickets\\" for early commuter trains. Over two million tickets were issued in 1893 alone. According to Dyos: \\"The most liberal provision was made on the London-Brighton railway.\\" In 1898, the company agreed to run extra trains specifically from Thornton Heath to Victoria, at 5:52am, 7:09am and 7:14am, and two more to London Bridge. Further services exclusive to Thornton Heath were introduced in 1903. The station sat at the optimum midpoint between Victoria and London Bridge. Workmen's returns were 4d to Victoria and 5d to London Bridge. For eleven years no other outer suburban station could offer cheaper aggregate fares to the City and West End. In 1894, all workmen's returns to London were set at 4d, an extra saving for Thornton Heath commuters. By 1898, there were thirty-five trains daily from Thornton Heath to Victoria, twenty-two to London Bridge and twenty-one to Croydon. Again, no other outer suburban line station could match this service. Aside from commuter services, the weekend adventurer could take advantage of fast and simple connections from Thornton Heath. The whole of Kent was within one change at London Bridge. A five-minute journey and a change at East Croydon brought Sussex and the south coast into the mix. Brighton could be reached in less than an hour. A twelve-minute ride to Clapham Junction opened up south east London, Hampshire, and the south west of England. Thornton Heath indeed, according to Dyos, possessed a \\"capital train service.\\" In 1903, the London-Brighton company took advantage of the spacious route between Thornton Heath and Balham in order to quadruple the lines and build a larger station. The most popular form of transport between Thornton Heath and Croydon was the tram. It was quicker and cheaper (1d) than the train. The Croydon tram system had its headquarters at Thornton Heath Pond (the bus garage stands on the site today). The first horse trams at Thornton Heath ran in 1879 and terminated at the junction of the High Street and Whitehorse Road (as buses still do today). The Times noted how the tram was following the train in the lead set by Thornton Heath and it neighbours: \\"Large numbers of housing are springing up in every direction and the very great facilities these districts enjoy of frequent and rapid access by railway to the metropolis has made them by far the most popular residential districts in the neighbourhood of London.\\" In 1901, the first electric tram outside the LCC ran between Thornton Heath Pond and Norbury. A branch line was built to Thornton Heath station in January 1902, making it the first suburb in London to have its own dedicated electric tramline branch. The later tramway extension to Streatham in 1909 provided Thornton Heath's passengers with access to the LCC network. Motor buses were introduced between Thornton Heath and Croydon in 1905 (fare 1d). The railways seemed to establish themselves as a natural migration method within the suburbs. Local resident and diarist Richard Gowlland wrote: \\"Mr Lake has offered to buy a house for us if we will go and live down his line.\\" (Gowlland, R and J: My Dearest Birdie; 2007). As the great railroads were opening up America in the mid-nineteenth century, a similar thing was happening in south London: \\"The lines which penetrated these more distant areas were as much the pioneers of human settlement as the trans-continental lines of North America\\", was Dyos's analogy. The Victorian Architect magazine (1883) saw it too: \\"The house-hunter in the suburbs of London is like the pioneer on the American prairie.\\" (1861‚Äì1911) Housing development A conservative calculation for Thornton Heath's population immediately before the railway station opened (1862) would be 1,200. This figure is based on the development along the Sussex road (A23). Local inhabitant Edgar Browne, son of Charles Dickens\\" illustrator \\"Phiz\\", notes that there were some 200 houses in the district about this time, and it has been calculated by Dyos that there were roughly six people per house in the Croydon area in this period. It was not until 1871, when the ecclesiastical district of St Paul was proposed, that the population of Thornton Heath was truly measured at 3,189. Around the station, the small-holdings of Josiah Humphries and Mary Coates were sold by their inheritors and went to form the initial central development. The 1881 census records 983 houses in the parish of St Paul's. In 1888, 1,000 houses were reported under construction in this area. Meanwhile, the north eastern district was late in developing. In the 1830s, prospector John Davidson Smith bought the Whitehorse Manor from John Cator to sell off as 500 smaller plots. He then speculated on an ancient spring on the slope of the Norwood Hills. He commissioned the architect Decimus Burton to build the Beulah Spa pleasure gardens which were a popular attraction for 20 years. Thousands came from all over the south east to sample the waters. The area developed a reputation as a beauty spot, attracting much speculative attention. However, most of the south eastern area remained rural, with gypsy camps reported on the Whitehorse farm up until the 1850s. In the northern district the clay based soil meant that bricks were in plentiful supply and they were much used in local building. The Brickfields were let for two years in 1854, with half a million bricks up for sale and enough clay dug for a further million. Part of the northern district at Green Lane had been given by Archbishop Grindal to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he had been master. The college suddenly became eager to sell in the 1890s when the land value rose after adjacent development. Apparently it is: \\"the only place where Pembroke has enjoyed that unearned increment through the spread of housing, which has helped to finance so many colleges.\\" Despite all the advantages of location and local materials there was an element of risk for developers in Thornton Heath. The principal means of financing construction was through building societies. They pooled resources to build houses for their subscribing members, which could then be leased or mortgaged. There was a greater advantage in freehold than leasehold, but it was more expensive. Freehold societies were similar to building societies, usually seeking freehold plots for the wealthy. However, in the late 1860s, the Englishman's Freehold Land Society was building affordable working class housing in Thornton Heath. Unfortunately, as Dyos notes, these institutions left behind few records. The cheapest procedure for a builder was to lease land from the owner or society then build property on the plot which he could rent or lease at his discretion. In south London, speculative developers took advantage of easy credit in return for perceived long-term gain. It was in their interest to get the construction done quickly. The short-term risk was that any delay, such as problems with infrastructure or third party suppliers, and it was the developer who lost out. There was a long-term risk for developers, too, as landowners could increase the rent when leases were renewed to cash in on surrounding development. Speculators also had to negotiate a number of peaks and troughs in the industry. Knowing the optimum time to invest was key. Indeed, success could be largely a matter of chance. The Thornton Heath and District Building Society opened in 1881 enthusiastically bought farmland near the Pond to lease to speculators, but with no immediate scope for development, they found themselves literally clutching at straws, and bankrupt just a year later. In 1887, a Parliamentary select committee in 1887 examined how plots in the suburbs were being cut up for letting purposes. A landholder gave evidence: \\"I had an opportunity to buy (seven acres of) land close to Thornton Heath station. Of course, it brings me no income at all. Neither is the land worth anything until something is built upon it.\\" The Improved Villa and Cottage Homes Building Company was formed in 1887 for the purposes of building local artisan dwellings under a mortgage system. In 1889, it bought of land at Thornton Heath for ¬£2,000. (This may have sounded a good deal. Twenty years previously the Board of Health had bought from John Bennington for ¬£3,000.) However, the company had no spare capital to carry out construction. They tried to sell the land but found the value had been overestimated. The original vendor bought back at a knock down price, but the firm went bankrupt in 1892. The failure of another speculative builder in 1901 was attributed to losses in work at Thornton Heath and the inability to let houses when completed. There were also knock-on effects as a result of failed speculation: in 1898, the debts of one Thornton Heath builder caused the bankruptcy of a solicitor. Then there were the more obvious pitfalls: a Thornton Heath builder paid a distributor 32s for a thousand bricks to be delivered by truck. But they had been pilfered and the builder was charged for receiving stolen goods. And there were factors not so obvious: in 1903, the LCC determined to buy a tract of land between Thornton Heath and Croydon described as \\"practically out in the fields\\" in order to build a large number of cottage dwellings for Irish immigrants. But they were advised that by building these houses, Croydon Council would take advantage of the need to provide shops and amenities to serve the residents, and the adjacent areas would become valuable. The recommendation was that the LCC should try to buy this surrounding land as well, to accommodate the advantage for itself. The development never took place. An eight-roomed semi in Thornton Heath could be rented for ¬£33 per annum in 1871, about half the average yearly wage. A prospective middle-class resident might try to buy such a house for ¬£800. Raising such money usually meant applying to the bank or building society, but private loans were an option, too. Richard Gowlland wrote: \\"I propose to buy a house: Cooper's eldest brother offered to lend me the money for the purpose at four per cent. This is really an offer not to be refused. It is cheaper than borrowing money from a building society. Their terms are really a little over five per cent.\\" Rents and prices fell towards the final years of the period, reflecting the higher density development and a recession. An eight-roomed house in 1907 could be rented for less than ¬£22 per annum. The same houses were for sale at ¬£650 on an eighty-nine year lease. Flats were not in proportion price-wise. Rent of a three-room flat cost 7s per week in 1908, or a four-room flat 8s per week. (1861‚Äì1911) Architecture There were no large estate developers operating in Thornton Heath until the early twentieth century, and few landholding companies made their presence felt because of the limited space. On the perimeter there were strings of villas, but after the separate Pond and station developments had been established, infilling of the area in between took place. Here, the different displays of textbook patterns show the suburb was favoured by one-road-at-a-time piecemeal builders. Thornton Heath seemed to be limited in the range of housing designs. Developers built villas while the district retained exclusivity, and in 1868, The Builder noted the \\"wholesome and rational style of building which is now dotting over the district between Camberwell and Croydon\\". An 1876 guide to the suburbs reported: \\"Lines of villas are fast encircling the town of Croydon, the neighbourhood of which being pleasant and picturesque and within easy reach of the city\\". \\"Villadom\\" didn't have a sustained impact in Thornton Heath, and from the mid-1870s onwards, as space became an issue, developers converted to uniform semi-detached and terraced, and even terraced made-to- look semi-detached. Some residents were not keen on downsizing. Residents, the Brownes had already knocked two semis into one. The Gowllands tried to hide their disappointment in their new Thornton Heath home: \\"She is very dissatisfied with the size of the rooms.\\" \\"It is a very tiny house; our only fear is that we shall be at a loss to know how to dispose of our numerous presents.\\" \\"If the dining room were a little larger it would be all we could desire.\\" There didn't seem to be much choice. Between proud villa and compact semi was a gap that developers didn't seem to account for, as the Gowllands noted again: \\"The houses all about us are very small or very large.\\" However, an honesty about Thornton Heath's working-class architecture appealed to some \\"From Streatham to Croydon (we see) dwelling houses of a small and unpretending class‚Ä¶ This is one of the social revolutions of the age\\" (Building News 1900), and the style by the end of the period is summed up thus: \\"Still many good houses in their own grounds but large estates are being rapidly covered with smaller houses and shops ‚Äì the majority of which are of good appearance.\\" In later years, commentators were not so kind on the aesthetics of the area. N. Pevsner singles out Thornton Heath for special attention in his introduction to the survey of Surrey (1971): \\"Continuous building did not spread over the county of London boundary until after World War One, except between London and Croydon where Thornton Heath has a desperate kind of mid-nineteenth-century character.\\" And regarding the larger houses on the slopes of the Norwood hills, D. Olsen (1976) remarks: \\"the mass- produced villas failed ludicrously to be baronial castles or ducal hunting lodges.\\" (1861‚Äì1911) Health A wide prevalence of disease in the Croydon district prompted a Parliamentary report into drainage in 1853. The district had a higher than average mortality rate of 28.1 per 1000 in 1848. A report to the Board of Guardians in 1848 reported: \\"the whole of the houses of Thornton Heath has no drainage, and cesspools contain the vilest compounds\\". Two cases of smallpox were recorded. Another report revealed that only the area up to the Pond was included in drainage plans. A civil engineer records that it was suggested to him that Thornton Heath was too small to waste effort on sewerage. Complaints were made by Thornton Heath residents that Croydon's effluvia was being directed toward them: \\"sundry nuisances and small pox, fever and diarrhea were rife\\". There were also complaints of the supply of \\"thick water\\" to the district. However, it should be stressed that during this period Thornton Heath was still largely rural, and aside from the hamlet around the Pond, there was no indication it would develop into a residential suburb. Moreover, there was little distinction over boundaries. Thornton Heath was just the western edge of Croydon. Perhaps the most important contribution of the Local Board of Health was the implementation of systematic water supply, drainage and sewerage. It was Edwin Chadwick, a leading government advisor on sanitation, who personally administered the rectification of the sanitation problem. Croydon subsequently became known as \\"Chadwick's model\\". He oversaw the construction of a new pumping system and a sewerage farm. The water supply, which was thought to be disease-ridden as it was supplied from under ground, was temporarily replaced by a supply from the Lambeth Water Company. When the remedies had been completed it was hailed as a complete success: \\"Drainage and pumpage combined with water works have almost banished typhus from towns like Croydon and reduced the death rate by a third.\\" Indeed, by 1867 the death rate had fallen to 16.6 per 1,000. However, a report into the cholera epidemic of 1866 revealed that water-borne disease was still claiming lives in Thornton Heath. Thornton Heath became the destination for Croydon's dead, sick and needy. The first task of the new Croydon Burial Board was to ease the overcrowding of existing parish burial grounds. Queen's Road was designated for the location of the borough cemetery. It was opened in 1861 with separate plots for differing denominations. An adult burial here cost 15s. Later, a second larger cemetery opened on the western side of Thornton Heath. A new union workhouse was opened in 1865 on a site of on Queen's Road, and the inmates of the old parish workhouse at Waddon transferred. Many seeking poor relief were forced to live here. The 1881 census records 765 inmates, mostly local. It must have been a tough regime. In 1875 there were 126 deaths recorded in the workhouse and a further twenty-two deaths in the adjacent \\"Abandoned Mothers and Infants Home\\". The workhouse later became Queen's Road Hospital. Mayday University Hospital began as the Workhouse infirmary and is now one of the largest hospitals in south London. Queen's Road became known locally as \\"Death and Poverty Row.\\" The Surrey Orphanage and Home for Girls was sited in Thornton Heath in 1874. The Poor Law hospital then moved to Thornton Heath, opening as the Croydon Union Infirmary with 435 beds. By 1899 it was admitting 11,000 patients a year. At one point the famous Bethlehem mental institution was due to be moved to Thornton Heath, before St Thomas's Hospital bought an alternative site at Lambeth. There may have been little abject poverty in Thornton Heath, and Croydon in general had comparative immunity from slumdom. But there were cases of deprivation as the suburb grew. In 1891, the wife of Baptist minister Charles Spurgeon: \\"opened a soup kitchen at Westwood, and distributed coals freely among the people in order to give some relief to the poor of Thornton Heath\\". The death-rate was roughly about the same as Croydon, but infant mortality could be very heavy. In 1900 it was almost three times higher than Croydon. Records give no account of why this should be. Edgar Browne noted: \\"Large families were the rule, and considered a blessing, not an inconvenience, with mothers devoting much of their time tending to the latest ‚Äúhardy annual‚Äù. One family had 18 children.\\" There were a number of cases of criminal neglect of children heard in the Croydon courts, often ending with parents in prison and children in a workhouse. (1861‚Äì1911) Civil amenities and employment Despite its early brushes with poor sanitation, the Croydon Local Board of Health was a progressive assembly, and introduced public baths, parks, and a fire brigade. Thornton Heath had developed at the right time to reap the benefits of a modern system of urban government. In 1881, the vestry of the newly established St Paul's church published Thornton Heath's first official population return as a separate parish, but this was a fleeting glimpse of the old parochial system. Just two years later, in 1883, Croydon received a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough. The Borough of Croydon was divided into six wards (Central, East, South, South Norwood, Upper and West) each returning six councillors. These, together with 12 aldermen and a mayor formed the borough council. Thornton Heath was split at the railway line between the West Ward and the Upper Ward. That Croydon's public works generally became a better organised affair was largely facilitated by the 1888 Local Government Act, under which Croydon became an autonomous county borough and usurped any remaining vestry power. Housing, education, hospitals, welfare, electricity and roads were now fully under council control. Thornton Heath's location did present some inconsistencies. Between 1888 and 1904, the borough had no control over water supply further than 2 miles (3 km) north of the Town Hall. The south, west and east areas of Thornton Heath were now covered by the Croydon Water Board with a local filtered supply, and the north area by the Lambeth Water Company, although the CWB could use its own supply for flushing, cleaning and other sanitary purposes in any part of the borough. In 1904, the corporation took over responsibility for that part of the system previously administered by the Lambeth Water Company but continued to pay for supply in that area. Sewage disposal was split three ways, the western area used Beddington Farm, the eastern area used South Norwood Farm and the northern area shared the LCC sewage system. The western area's gas was supplied by the Croydon Gas Company and the eastern area by the South Suburban Gas Company. From 1891, an alternating current of electricity was provided by the British Houston company based at Waddon. In 1898, the council took over these works and switched Thornton Heath to a direct current. In 1901, the first electric lights were used in the High Street, followed by the electrification of the tram. Thornton Heath's fire fighting volunteers were formed in 1871 and based in the eastern district at Beulah Road. Before incorporation their expenses weren't even covered by the rates. After incorporation there were eight paid firemen based at Thornton Heath, one of three stations in the borough. A police station was opened in 1887 and officers came under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police. The Croydon Schools Board was a \\"surprisingly harmonious affair between board and vestry\\", according to Morris. It was formed just after the 1870 Education Act. Before this, a Thornton Heath child would have been lucky to attend junior group- teaching from a governess or clergyman. The first schoolhouse in Thornton Heath was a pub which became a temporary classroom by day. By the end of the period there were five schools that served the district: Beulah, Ecclesbourne, Whitehorse, Winterbourne and Wildbore (later West Thornton). Each school averaged around 300 pupils giving a total of 1,500 children being schooled up to the age of eleven. There were no secondary schools in Thornton Heath, and that situation remains today. The nearest was the Borough Secondary Grammar Schools. The Borough Secondary School (Boys) opened in September 1904 and the Girls in 1909. The passing of the Technical Education Act in 1890 allowed councils to fund the creation of polytechnic colleges. In 1892 a branch opened in Thornton Heath and there was a high demand for places. There were around 350 students at the centre by the end of the period. The most popular courses in 1902 were cooking, plumbing, elocution and German. This information from a local newspaper, may reveal something about the suburban outlook of this time: proficiency in cooking and plumbing made for a healthier home, elocution could help you \\"get on\\", and the study of German may suggest civil service and teaching positions were sought after. Community farms supplied much local work in Thornton Heath from 1861 to 1881 but there seems to have been plenty of other opportunities: \\"Industry in any profession would secure a livelihood, openings were not difficult to find and competition was not severe,\\" claimed Edgar Browne. Indeed, locals may have been able to pick and choose. Jess Gowlland, a newcomer to the suburb wrote in 1877: \\"I have been dreadfully troubled lately having found it impossible to get a general servant.\\" There was, of course, demand for labour in the building trade. One builder was arrested for \\"selling\\" site administration jobs. Little else was offered in the situations vacant columns apart from positions for young adults: \\"Smart girl required as maid\\"; \\"Lad wanted to make himself useful\\". Most of the migrant population came to live, and to take advantage of Thornton Heath's position as ideal commuter country. The main voice for complaint in Thornton Heath was the rate-payers association (THRPA). When the Church took up the rallying call of the free libraries campaign in 1886, a public meeting in Thornton Heath supported a motion rejecting free libraries, or at least church involvement in them. A threatened rate addition of a penny in the pound prompted the formation of the THRPA. According to J.N. Morris (1992), they were a key indicator in suburban settlements of the dissatisfaction in the provision of service. They were powerful lobbies and members could get elected to boards or the council. The THRPA was often used as a political tool: the tramways bill, allowing Croydon Council to buy the existing lines prior to electrification, was eased through after ratepayers were encouraged to vote yes. They could also be unpopular: residents often complained about the inadequate supply of water from the only well in the vicinity at Selhurst. Yet in 1906, fearing a rate increase, the THRPA voted two to one against a council scheme to sink a new well. They also earned a rebuke from the Thornton Heath Echo after the new clock tower was erected with mainly public subscriptions: \\"The Ratepayers Association, though well off in funds, gave nothing towards the clock.\\" The Clocktower, completed in 1900, still stands at the junction of Thornton Heath High Street and Parchmore Road, on a site previously called Walker's Green. (1861‚Äì1911) Leisure Thornton Heath was blessed in all things leisure. There were four football clubs in the district, Croydon Athletic, Croydon Common, Crystal Palace and Thornton Heath Wednesday. Croydon Cricket Club played matches near the Pond. Walking was popular as the area was renowned for its beauty. A recreation ground opened to the public in 1884, followed in 1900 by Grange Wood of , purchased by the council for ¬£22,000. The library opened in the High Street in 1895 (records show that of the 1,302 books that were borrowed one week in that year, 1,130 were fiction). A swimming baths opened next door in 1897 at a cost of ¬£8,064. There were all manner of clubs and societies: cycling, photography, art, music, and the ancient order of druids met every Wednesday at the Prince of Wales pub. By 1911, Thornton Heath had over 100 stores in three parades, the High Street, Beulah Road and at the Pond. In 1910, the Electric Palace cinema opened in the High Street. It was open daily from 2pm to 11pm and seats were 3d or 6d. By August there were \\"massive crowds\\" attending In The Time Of The Pharaohs. Thornton Heath also had 26 pubs listed in 1903, one for every 540 people. The pond was a place for public relaxation, but had become a hazard by the late 19th century, a parcel mail coach having notably come to grief in it in 1891. To commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897, a large fountain was placed in the middle of the pond and railings were erected around it. In 1953 the pond was drained and is now a major roundabout on the London to Brighton route (the A23 road). In 1975, due to sporadic incidents of vandalism, the decision was made to fill in the pool as well. In January 2003, a new water feature (funded by Croydon Council's Smarter Croydon initiative) was put in place, although this was soon removed. Thornton Heath Pond remains a name principally for traffic bulletins. (1861‚Äì1911) Religion As early as 1852, the Vicar of Croydon invited particular attention to be paid to the \\"growing district of Thornton Heath, a large district 1.5 miles north of Croydon not provided for\\", as part of the grand ecclesiastical plan to build 600 new churches in the growing metropolitan areas. Yet a parish was not proposed until 1868. The temporary church of St Paul was erected later that year. An ecclesiastical district was assigned to the church in 1871. Not all parishioners were keen on it: The Gowllands wrote: \\"Our church is not very attractive du reste. It is necessary to whip up all the piety one possesses to induce one to go to church at all.\\" In the western and northern districts the Wildbore School hall used for Anglicans services from 1871 became St Jude's in 1904. The Warwick Road mission built on the border of Norbury in 1889 became St Stephen's in 1909. There was also strong representation from non- conformists, Baptists, Congregationalists, Free Evangelicals, Methodists, Primitive Methodists, United Methodists, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics all had their own churches in the district by 1905. There were also two further missions in the West Thornton area and the Salvation Army in the High Street. All the same, the locals seemed to delight in their nickname as the \\"Heathens\\". (1861‚Äì1911) Social aspects In Thornton Heath's early years, as Edgar Browne tells us: \\"Class distinctions were strongly marked and servants strictly controlled.\\" The neighbourhood was populated with a number of professionals: \\"We have neighbours ranging from the very rich to parsons, doctors, lawyers, authors, artists.\\" Certainly, the older western district reflected a wealthier past. A few years later, residents of the eastern district took a different view. Richard Gowlland wrote: \\"We have made friends with the parson and his wife. They are commonish people. There seems indeed to be a great dearth of decent people about us. We couldn't have hit upon a more barren neighbourhood than this in this respect.\\" The Cheap Trains Act had a big impact on Thornton Heath. The Liberals in Croydon were accused of diminishing the town's attractiveness by encouraging working-class enclaves through their support of workmen's fares. It was possible that the encouragement of subsidies saw the suburb with middle-class credentials develop working-class characteristics. However, is likely to have been combined with the limited size of the district. Developers quickly saw that ten small terraced houses were far more profitable than two large villas. The work of the Englishman's Freehold Land Society was an indicator of this thinking, as was the later LCC estate. But there was still a group of residents in Thornton Heath that displayed middle-class leanings. The Primrose League, representing working-class conservative ethics, was \\"scorned as an outlet for middle-class snobbery\\" (Coetzee, F., Parliamentary History, 16, 1997), but there were frequent and crowded meetings at the Thornton Heath branch, at which high-profile Tory MPs were regular guests. J. R. Moore (Urban History 30/2 2003) claims there was a general defection of urban support to the Conservatives at this time. Meanwhile, McManus and Ethington (Urban History 34/2 2007) claim the challenge to academics is to disentangle the aspiring middle-class myths such as Diary of a Nobody from the realities of suburban life. But this kind of suburbia did exist in Thornton Heath, as proved by the Gowlland collection of letters. Edwardian demise of a Victorian suburb The peak of Thornton Heath's population in the early 20th century was 15,000, which was reported in the Thornton Heath Echo in 1902 with an editorial proudly proclaiming: \\"enough to show continued progress of the district. We have the makings of a very fine suburb.\\" But the start of the 20th century saw a petty rivalry between Thornton Heath and Croydon. It started when the council organised a carnival to celebrate the dawning of the 20th century and to raise funds for the Croydon Hospital (situated in Thornton Heath). However, unlike the other districts in the borough, Thornton Heath was not invited as a separate entity and had to take part under the banner of Croydon. Stung by the \\"insult\\", the district responded by organising its own carnival, spurred on by the proprietors of the Echo. In June 1900, a spectacular event took place attracting many visitors from the surrounding districts. It was huge success, and raised more money towards the hospital fund than the Croydon carnival. A few days later, to compound Croydon's embarrassment, Princess Christian toured through Thornton Heath after a visit to the hospital, snubbing Croydon itself. Praise came from national newspapers: The Times, possibly unaware of the carnival of the previous week, congratulated the district at the elaborate scale of decorations for an impromptu royal visit. Meanwhile, The Telegraph declared; \\"At one time Thornton Heath was considered the village and Croydon the town, now the case is considered vice versa.\\" And the Echo beamed: \\"Thornton Heath is no longer one of Croydon's infants. It has not only learnt to walk, but run.\\" Ironically, it was Thornton Heath's own \\"suburb\\" that put paid to any delusions of grandeur. The settlement at Norbury had been growing steadily since the 1880s. In 1904, a new newspaper, the Norbury News and Thornton Heath Chronicle proudly proclaimed: \\"Norbury has passed Rubicon of newspaper ruraldom.\\" It then demanded that the THRPA become the Thornton Heath and Norbury Ratepayers Association. Next it proposed that the council petition Parliament to split the existing West Ward, with the resulting new sector to be christened \\"Norbury Ward\\" to officially recognise the area. Sure enough, in 1905, prompted by the growing electorate of the Thornton Heath district, the old West Ward was divided. A new \\"North Ward\\" was formed which took in Thornton Heath to the west of the railway line but included all of Norbury, In 1909, St Paul's parish lost a section of its population count to the new church of St Stephen on the Norbury border. Thornton Heath was shrinking. Norbury had broken away and formed its own suburb. Looking back at the history one can see that the district had come full circle: Bensham begat Norbury; Norbury begat Thornton Heath; Thornton Heath begat Norbury. In the early years of the 20th century, a general depression hit Thornton Heath's residents. Croydon had always been expensive for rates since their introduction, but in 1906 they went up to 7s/8d, compared to 6s/6d in Bromley, the most expensive year of the period. There were rent increases too. Unemployment rose and a number of suicides were reported. Charity was encouraged. Hundreds, then thousands of poor children were given aid over the Christmas periods between 1906 and 1909. By 1908, Thornton Heath was officially recognised by government as 'a largely working class suburb'. It was also being referred to as the \\"poorer district of Croydon\\". Thornton Heath would grow once more, but would always have closer associations with urban inner London rather than a suburban outer idyll. Suburban anonymity Despite its seemingly prime location, Thornton Heath remains to some degree terra incognita for most Londoners, an uncharted landscape for historians, and suffers from an acute form of that metaphysical suburban trait: anonymity. If a defining factor of a suburb is in the relationship with its urban centre, as suggested by Dyos, then Thornton Heath led a double life, as it felt the influence of not one urban centre, but two. And two \\"monsters\\" at that, juxtaposed today at the point where Europe's largest city and Europe's largest town, 7.2 miles (11.6 km) south of central London, and 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Croydon. By playing \\"piggy in the middle\\", Thornton Heath struggled to establish a recognisable identity. In its early development it had no official status as a ward, village or town. It was a vague area between other places. As the Victorian development progressed this identity problem was compounded by another factor in its location: in Croydon, it was said, \\"geographic elevation was a good guide to social elevation\\". (F. Coetzee, Parliamentary History, 1997.) Thornton Heath's valley status meant the community endured a sense of inferiority to those on the wealthier higher slopes. Furthermore, nestling, as it does, behind the Norwood hills, the suburb hides from London's gaze, one of the few parts of the sprawl unseen even from today's tallest structures in the central metropolis.

In 1813, she married George Gordon, Marquis of Huntly, afterwards the 5th Duke of Gordon. She was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church but left it and joined the Free Church of Scotland in 1846.  Biography  Gordon was born in London on 20 June 1794. Her father, Alexander Brodie, was of the Clan Brodie from the north of Scotland. Carefully educated, the heiress of great wealth, and possessed of a handsome figure and a bright, joyous disposition, she married George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly, on 11 December 1813. He was 25 years older than herself. Her position gave her access to the best society, but revelations of unblushing vice in high quarters distressed her, and led her to study the Bible for solace under her grief. She became a most earnest believer, and after a time made a complete renunciation of the world. Becoming Duchess of Gordon in 1827, at the age of 33, she deliberately began a life of earnest devotion. She became interested in schools, chapels, and other Christian undertakings among her own people, and when in 1836 the death of her husband, with whom she had lived in much affection, made her independent, her devotion became more intense than ever. Huntly Lodge, her residence, was situated in Strathbogie, one of the chief fields of the well- known conflict between the church and the civil courts previous to 1843, when the disruption of the Church of Scotland occurred. The duchess was an Episcopalian, but her sympathies were with those who were in conflict with the civil courts, though she was not disposed to identify herself with their movement. In 1846 her views changed. Believing that the Church of England was not constituted in accordance with the mind of the Lord, because it had no discipline, she left it after a long mental conflict, and joined the Free Church of Scotland. The leaders of the Free church, such as William Howels, were her personal friends, and often visited her house and held religious meetings under her roof. She came to occupy among evangelical Christians in Scotland the position that in former years had been held by the Countess of Leven and Viscountess Glenorchy. Her death took place somewhat suddenly at Huntly Lodge on 31 January 1864, in her seventieth year. References  Further reading  *Stuart, A. Moody (1865).

Jefferson's memoir provided detailed information on life at Monticello. In it, he also attested to Thomas Jefferson's fathering the children of Sally Hemings, affirming Madison's account. In 1998, a DNA study showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of Eston Hemings, the youngest son. Early life and education Israel Gillette was born into slavery; he estimated about 1797. His enslaved parents were a woman known as Jane and Edward Gillett. Together, Edward and Jane had thirteen children, all of whom bore their father's surname Gillette.\\"Edward and Jane Gillette\\", African American Family Histories, Monticello, accessed 14 August 2011 During his years as a slave at the Monticello estate, Gillette served in a number of capacities, starting as a waiter at the family table at about the age of eight years. Of his service to Mr. Jefferson, he said: \\"For fourteen years I made the fire in his bedroom and private chamber, cleaned his office, dusted his books, run of errands and attended him about home\\". He and his older brother Gilly \\"... were both retained about the person of our master as long as he lived.\\" He added, \\"Frequently, gentlemen would call upon him on business of great importance, whom I used to usher into his presence,\\" and \\"sometimes I would be employed in burnishing or doing some other work in the room where they were.\\" Among the visitors was the Marquis de Lafayette, who had served in the Revolution. Of that occasion Israel Jefferson recalled: > In those times I minded but little concerning the conversations which took > place between Mr. Jefferson and his visitors. But I well recollect a > conversation he had with the great and good Lafayette, when he visited this > country in 1824 and 1825, as it was of personal interest to me and mine. It was during this frank discussion that Lafayette expressed his concerns about the continuation of slavery in the now independent United States of America. In the book Friends of Liberty, Gary Nash and Graham Russell Gao Hodges describe this conversation: > \\"Speaking openly in the presence of Israel, Jefferson's slave who waited on > their tables and stood postilion on his master's carriage, Lafayette > lectured Jefferson about the retired president's continued ownership of > slaves and his unwillingness to speak out as a revered American leader on > the subject. 'No man could rightfully hold ownership of his brother man,' > Lafayette gravely maintained. He had come from France to fight for American > independence because he believed they were fighting for a great and noble > principle ‚Äì the freedom of mankind.\\" The account continues, \\"Now, decades > later, he was grieved that instead of all being free, a portion were held in > bondage. Rebuked, Jefferson contended that slavery should be extinguished > but that the proper time had not yet arrived.\\"Gary B. Nash and Graham > Russell Gao Hodges, Friends of Liberty; Thomas Jefferson, Tadeusz > Kosciuszko, and Agrippa Hull. A Tale of Three Patriots, Two Revolutions, and > A Tragic Betrayal Of Freedom In The New Nation, New York: Basic Books, pp. > 239‚Äì240 Sold from Monticello In 1829, three years after Jefferson's death, Gillette was among the 130 slaves sold from Monticello to settle Jefferson's debts. He was sold to Thomas Walker Gilmer. Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Jefferson's oldest grandson and executor of the late President's estate, supervised the sales, which broke up many of the slave families of Monticello. Elected to the Virginia House of Delegates that same year, Gilmer was later named Speaker. He went on to be elected the 28th Governor of Virginia, and later to the 27th and 28th U.S. Congress. In 1844 Rep. Gilmer was appointed by President John Tyler to be U.S. Secretary of the Navy. Gillette later said that Gilmer asked him then to go with him to the capital as his servant, but he would have had to leave his wife behind. Gillette \\"demurred,\\" as he put it, not refusing but saying he preferred to gain his freedom. Having originally paid $500 for Gillette in 1829, Gilmer agreed in 1844 to let Gillette purchase his freedom for the same price. Gillette had served him for 14 years. Secretary Gilmer was accidentally killed on board the newly commissioned warship U.S.S. Princeton when one of its two large guns the \\"Peacemaker\\" exploded during a test firing while on a ceremonial tour on the Potomac River with 400 guests aboard. He had been in his new post for just over one week. President John Tyler was also onboard, though unhurt. Israel believed that he himself would most assuredly have been killed alongside his former master had he accompanied him to Washington because, as he said, \\"... it would have been my duty to keep very close to his person.\\" It was the unfortunate fate of another fellow slave by the name of Armistead, who was likewise obliged to be aboard ship at the time, to also perish in the explosion. In order to avoid the Virginia law requiring freedmen to leave the state within 12 months after manumission, Gillette was purchased in his wife's name. He later recalled that it was not until they left Virginia for Ohio that he felt truly free. On registering as a free black in Ohio, a clerk suggested that he take the name of his master, the president Jefferson, which he did. Marriage and family Gillette married twice. His first wife, Mary Ann Colter, a fellow slave with whom he had four children, died young. Their children were sold from Monticello before his own purchase, and he lost touch with them. About 1838, while still held by Gilmer, Gillette met and married Elizabeth (Farrow) Randolph, a free woman of color and widow with ten children. As her mother Martha Thackey was white, Elizabeth was born free, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem. After he bought his freedom, Jefferson and Elizabeth decided to leave Virginia. They migrated with their family to the free state of Ohio, where they settled in Cincinnati. Upon arrival in Ohio, the Jeffersons renewed their marriage vows. They had been married about 35 years at the time of his memoir. The North, literacy and land In Cincinnati, Jefferson learned to read and write. He worked as a waiter in the city but shifted to work on steamboats, where he earned much more money. The river boats traveled extensively on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. After living and working 14 years based in Cincinnati, he and his wife owned a farm together in Pike County. They became members of Eden Baptist Church, where Jefferson served as a deacon and treasurer. After the American Civil War and emancipation of all slaves, his brother Moses Gillette (1803-after 1880) migrated to Ohio with his family and settled near him. During those years, Jefferson returned more than once to Monticello to visit. At the nearby Edge Hill plantation, around 1866 he encountered the elderly Thomas Jefferson Randolph, reduced to poverty as he had lost all his property during the Civil War. (In 1829 Randolph had published the first collection of President Jefferson's writings.)Jefferson Randolph, Thomas, Memoir, Correspondence And Miscellanies: From The Papers Of Thomas Jefferson. \\"Life Among the Lowly\\" Jefferson had been a close childhood friend of Madison Hemings, a son of Sally Hemings at Monticello. Madison, his brother Eston Hemings and their families also moved to Pike County, Ohio. In the year 1873, Hemings and Jefferson, then both established, older men, were both interviewed by the journalist Samuel F. Wetmore, who published their memoirs successively in the Pike County Republican under the feature title: \\"Life Among the Lowly.\\" Hemings said that he and his siblings were children of Thomas Jefferson, and that their mother had been his concubine. (The liaison had first been reported in the early nineteenth century, in what became known by historians as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy.) In his 1873 memoir, Jefferson corroborated Hemings' statement of being the \\"natural son\\" of Thomas Jefferson: > I know that it was a general statement among the older servants at > Monticello, that Mr. Jefferson promised his wife, on her death bed, that he > would not again marry. I also know that his servant, Sally Hemmings (sic), > (mother to my old friend and former companion at Monticello, Madison > Hemmings,) was employed as his chamber-maid, and that Mr. Jefferson was on > the most intimate terms with her; that, in fact, she was his concubine. This > I know from my intimacy with both parties, and when Madison Hemmings > declares that he is a natural son of Thomas Jefferson, the author of the > Declaration of Independence, and that his brothers Beverly and Eston and > sister Harriet are of the same parentage, I can as conscientiously confirm > his statement as any other fact which I believe from circumstances but do > not positively know. Jefferson noted that Sally Hemings and her four children had been freed at the death of Thomas Jefferson, as well as others in the Hemings family. Thomas Jefferson Randolph, the president's eldest grandson, disputed Israel Jefferson's statement in an angry attack published in the Pike County Republican, December 25, 1873. He accused Israel Jefferson of \\"calumny\\" and adding to a political attack, and denied both that his grandfather had the relationship, and that he had freed Hemings and her children. (Note: Some facts are verifiable: Randolph's mother gave Hemings her time, an informal, discreet kind of freedom that enabled her to live in Charlottesville with her two sons; Thomas Jefferson freed two of her sons by name in his will of 1826, which was public, and had allowed the other two to \\"escape\\" earlier in 1822 when they came of age, which was known by his overseer Edmund Bacon, who wrote about it in his own memoir, and was observed by some of his neighbors at the time.) Earlier in the 1850s, Randolph had told the historian Henry Randall that his late uncle Peter Carr was the father of Sally Hemings' children, although his uncle had been married and Randolph was violating a social taboo by naming him. Randall passed on the family story in an 1868 letter to the historian James Parton. In his 1874 biography of Thomas Jefferson, James Parton first published the Peter Carr paternity account; it was taken up by succeeding historians through the mid-20th century.Annette Gordon-Reed, Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy, 1999, with revised foreword discussing the 1998 DNA data. Jefferson-Hemings controversy Until the late 20th century, historians generally discounted the testimony of Hemings and Israel Jefferson in favor of the denials of the president's recognized descendants. Following additional late 20th-century historical analysis by Annette Gordon-Reed, among others, and a DNA study in 1998 that disproved the Carr claim and showed a match between the Jefferson male line and an Eston Hemings' descendant, the scholarship has changed dramatically. Many historians now accept that Thomas Jefferson had a long-term relationship with Sally Hemings and fathered all her children.\\"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\\", People of the Plantation, Monticello, accessed 14 August 2011. Quote: \\"Based on the documentary, scientific, statistical, and oral history evidence, the TJF Research Committee Report on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (January 2000) remains the most comprehensive analysis of this historical topic. Ten years later, TJF and many historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison, and Eston Hemings.\\" In 2012, the Smithsonian Institution and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation held a major exhibit at the National Museum of American History: Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty; it says that \\"evidence strongly support[s] the conclusion that Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings' children.\\"Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty, 27 January 2012-14 October 2012, Smithsonian Institution, accessed 23 March 2012. Quote: \\"The [DNA] test results show a genetic link between the Jefferson and Hemings descendants: A man with the Jefferson Y chromosome fathered Eston Hemings (born 1808). While there were other adult males with the Jefferson Y chromosome living in Virginia at that time, many historians now believe that the documentary and genetic evidence, considered together, strongly support the conclusion that Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings's children.\\" Other historians continue to dispute these conclusions, suggesting that Randolph Jefferson, the president's younger brother, or other Jeffersons could have been the father. They were never seriously proposed as alternatives until after the DNA study results were known.Alexander Boulton, \\"The Monticello Mystery-Case Continued\\": reviews of The Jefferson-Hemings Myth: An American Travesty; A President in the Family: Thomas Jefferson, Sally Hemings and Thomas Woodson; and Free Some Day: African American Families at Monticello ; in William & Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 58, No. 4, October 2001. Quote: \\"Past defenses of Jefferson having proven inadequate, the TJHS advocates have pieced together an alternative case that preserves the conclusions of earlier champions but introduces new \\"evidence\\" to support them. Randolph Jefferson, for example, had never seriously been considered as a possible partner of Sally Hemings until the late 20th century, when DNA evidence indicated that a Jefferson was unquestionably the father of Eston.\\" See also *Thomas Jefferson and slavery *Sally Hemings *Madison Hemings *Eston Hemings *Harriet Hemings *Isaac Jefferson *List of slaves References Bibliography *Nash, Gary B.; Hodges, Graham R.G.

History Lao pop music started forming itself in the late 1980s, when Laos started benefiting from an economic growth that has lasted till nowadays. Before the reforms implemented by the government, the entertainment industry was completely limited due to the tight censorship and the widespread poverty, which prevented the music scene from flourishing. From the 1970s to the late 1980s, the strictly patriotic songs, sponsored by the communist government, and the traditional Mor Lam genere were the only generes available to listen. At the start of the 1990s decade, the Lao music scene started transformating. The first private music labels started emerging in Vientiane, the capital city, and some live music pubs appeared. However, these labels, at first, were financially weak and had a very limited capacity to promote their artists. Although at first the traditional Lao music, was still the most popular genere, the foreign influence of Korean K-Pop music, Japanese J-Pop music, and the pop music made in the neighbouring Thailand started being felt, not only in the fashion trends, but also in the local musical scene. From the start of the 2000s, Lao pop saw a dramatic increase of popularity due to the growing strength of the mainly Vientiane based music labels such as Lao-Pride Records, KPY Entertainment, Indee Records and Muanson Media. Lao pop gained local and international spotlight through Alexandra Bounxouei, who is considered to be the first Lao pop princess. Other Lao artists popular with the younger generation include Cells, L.O.G, Overdance, Princess, Caramel, Pull-T Club, Super One, Genii, Xtreme, Dozo, Tik Keoprasert, MAY, Annita, and Aluna.Aluna inspires youth to follow their dreams From the mid 2000s, Lao Pop started benefiting itself from the growing number of musical events held in the country. For example, in 2008, was held from first time, the first edition of the Lao Music Awards, which was broadcast live by the Lao National Television. In this event, the most outstanding Lao Pop, rock and Mor Lam singers are awarded in its different categories. Since then on, this gala has been held almost annually in the National Cultural Hall of Vientiane. Apart from this event, other kinds of shows also encouraged the growth of the local music scene. Lao pop today embraces a wide variety of styles that are mainly based in Vientiane, the capital of Laos. There are also a number of Lao artists from Luang Prabang, Laos. Popularity Lao pop is popular in Laos and has recently penetrated neighboring markets. There is also a growing fan base in the United States, France, and Canada.

Early life Henrietta Gordon, was the youngest daughter of Lord John Gordon, created Viscount of Melgum and Lord Aboyne in 1627, by Sophia Hay, fifth daughter of Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll. She was born about 1628. Her father was the second son of George Gordon, 1st Marquis of Huntly, by his wife, the former Lady Henrietta Stewart, eldest daughter of the first Duke of Lennox. He was burned to death at Frendraught in October 1630; and, his widow dying on 22 March 1642, Henrietta was left an orphan. She had been brought up a Roman Catholic, and, her guardian and uncle George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly, being a Protestant, her mother on her deathbed commended her to the care of her father confessor, Gilbert Blackhall. He went to Paris in the hope of obtaining instructions from Henrietta's grandmother, the Dowager Marquise of Huntly (also Henrietta, n√©e Stewart of Lennox). The marquise, however, pleading poverty, took no step to have the child brought to Paris, as Blackhall thought she should be; and so he applied to Anne of Austria, and obtained from her a letter, under the joint sign-manual of herself and the king, praying the Marquis of Huntly, who had assumed the guardianship of Henrietta (with the intention of having her educated in the Protestant faith), to permit Blackhall to escort her to France. Blackhall therefore went to Scotland, and, after delays, obtained the charge of Henrietta, and took ship with her from Aberdeen on 26 July 1643. In Paris, Henrietta was presented to the queen by her second cousin, Ludovic, fifth son of Esm√© Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (better known as Monsieur d'Aubigny), and was sent to the convent of the Filles de Ste. Marie, Rue St. Antoine, to learn French. After remaining there a year she was placed under the charge of Madame de Brienne, who found it more convenient to send her to the convent of Charonne, where she objected to the rule and ways of the mother superior, and meagre diet of the convent. Blackhall accordingly induced the queen to have her removed to the convent of St. Nicolas de Lorraine, where she remained from 8 January to 10 August 1647, when she was transferred to that of Fervacques in the Faubourg St. Germain. Here she resided till 20 January 1649, when, the Fronde having raised an insurrection in the streets of Paris, she was by the queen's orders brought to St. Germain-en-Laye under the escort of Monsieur d'Aubigny. French court Too proud to enter the service of the Princess de Cond√©, which the queen proposed to her, and neglected by Madame de Brienne, she subsisted for some time on the charity of Mesdames de Ferran and de la Flotte. At length, however, she was admitted to the queen's household in the capacity of supernumerary maid of honour, and after two years' probation was accepted as maid of honour. She figures in the M√©moires of Mademoiselle de Montpensier, who represents her as in 1658 high in the favour of Philippe, duc d'Orl√©ans, known as Monsieur, who devoted a great part of his time and thought to her dress. She is said to have had liaisons with Cl√©rambault and Bouvron. On the marriage of Monsieur with the Princess Henrietta of England she was appointed lady of the bedchamber to Madame, and after the death of Madame she served Philippe's second wife, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, sometimes called la seconde Madame, in the same capacity. From a letter of Mademoiselle de la Fayette, written in December 1672, it appears that Henrietta was on bad terms with her new mistress. After this date we hear no more of her. She seems to have been generally unpopular, and Blackhall gives her a character for ingratitude.

Although Test Match Sofa is not illegal the ECB has argued that its operation is in principle in contravention of the Board's authority to control UK broadcasting rights - especially radio rights which have been sold to the BBC. Despite this, an almost identical operation, Guerilla Cricket, began broadcasting commentary of England v India Test matches in July 2014 and has continued, with a line-up very similar to that of Test Match Sofa, into the winter with coverage of the Pakistan v Australia series from the UAE and the 2015 Ashes series. Furthermore, ahead of the 2017-18 Ashes, Norcross joined Test Match Special's commentary team. In addition, when they lost out to TalkSPORT for the broadcast rights to England‚Äôs 2018 tour of Sri Lanka, the BBC produced The Cricket Social for the tour, starring Norcross and the rest of the Test Match Special team in a format similar to Test Match Sofa‚Äôs.The Cricket Social makes a promising debut by boldly making the sport itself utterly incidental by Dave Tickner The Independent Guests on the show have included cricketers John Barclay, Martin Bicknell, Iain O'Brien, Rikki Clarke, John Emburey, Laurie Evans, Graeme Fowler, Angus Fraser, Ed Giddins, Greg Matthews, Tim Murtagh, Ollie Rayner, Shaun Tait and Claire Taylor.

Founded in 1999, the company owns and operates Trip.com, Skyscanner, Qunar, and Ctrip, all of which are online travel agencies. Founded in 1999, it is currently the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China and one of the largest travel service providers in the world. History The company was founded by James Liang, Neil Shen, Min Fan, and Qi Ji in June 1999. The company was listed on the NASDAQ in 2003 through a variable interest entity (VIE) based in the Cayman Islands in a Merrill Lynch-led offering, raising US$75 million from the sale of 4.2 million American depositary receipts at $18 each. It appreciated 86% to close at $33.94 per ADR in its first day of trading. The stock traded at a peak of $37.35 on its first day of trading, making it the first company since the November 2000 IPO of Transmeta to double its price in the first day of trading. In 2006, about 70% of the company's sales came from just four cities in China: Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. On August 6, 2014, Priceline.com, announced that it will invest $500 million in the company to broaden the companies‚Äô options in China. Priceline and Ctrip, which have had a commercial partnership since 2012, will increase their cross-promotion of each company's hotel inventory and other travel services, the companies said in a statement. In May 2015, Booking Holdings (formerly The Priceline Group) announced it would be investing an additional $250 million in the company. In November 2016, the company acquired Skyscanner for ¬£1.4 billion. That same month, Jane Jie Sun became the CEO of Ctrip. She had joined the company in 2005. On November 1, 2017, Ctrip acquired Trip.com, rebranding it as its global brand website. In February 2018, Ctrip launched TrainPal, an online ticketing platform featuring split ticketing, in the United Kingdom. Accredited by the National Rail of the UK, TrainPal mainly provides services for the UK, and other European countries. In September 2019, Ctrip completed a share exchange with Naspers and became the single largest shareholder of MakeMyTrip.

In 1803, when eighteen years of age, he was appointed assistant-surgeon in the army, and soon after joined the 91st Highlanders, accompanying the regiment to Germany in 1805. He saw service also in the Peninsula, and escaped shipwreck in the Douro (one of seven survivors) while in charge of invalids from Sir J. Moore's army. He became surgeon to the 2nd battalion 89th regiment, and afterwards to the 4th regiment (King's Own), along with which he joined the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula, was present at Salamanca, Vittoria, Badajoz, San Sebastian, and Burgos, and was promoted to the rank of staff-surgeon. Having been badly wounded in crossing the frontier into France, he was brought home and was invalided for a year. He resumed duty at Chelsea Hospital as staff-surgeon, had charge of a hospital at Brussels, after the Battle of Waterloo, and joined Wellington's staff in Paris, where he was promoted to be physician to the forces. After the peace he was chosen by Sir J. MacGrigor to be professional assistant at the medical board of the war office, and spent the remaining 30 years of his life in that administrative capacity.

She was married about 1763 to her cousin, Captain James Grant of Carron, near Elchies, on the Spey. Grant being unfortunate, sold Carron in 1786 or 1787 to Robert Grant of Wester Elchies, and in 1790 he died within Holyrood. Mrs. Grant was afterwards married to Dr. Murray, a Bath physician, and she died in Bath about 1814. A portrait of her was at Castle Grant. Roy's Wife, Mrs. Grant's only known production, instantly became popular. Its allusions bear upon persons and places on the Aberdeen border of Mrs. Grant's native county. There are fragments of a legendary lyric with several of the same references, but Roy's Wife superseded those, besides appropriating to itself the old Ruffian's Rant to which it was sung. Writing to Thomson in 1793 and 1794, Robert Burns referred to the song, and himself makes a little English experiment to the same tune, in a conciliatory address to Mrs. Riddel. As in these letters Burns calls the air 'Roy's Wife,' while his 'Ladie Onlie,' written for Johnson's 'Museum' in 1787 is set to the tune 'The Ruffian's Rant,' we get an approximate date for the appearance of Mrs. Grant's song.

Twenty episodes were initially ordered, but the order was later extended to 22 episodes. The series stars Valerie Bertinelli, Wendie Malick, Jane Leeves, and Betty White. After being on hiatus since March 23, 2011, Hot in Cleveland returned on June 15, 2011 to air the remaining 12 episodes of season 2 ending on August 31, 2011. Plot The second season picks up 24 hours after the storm and Elka's arrest on hiding stolen property. While in jail, Elka reveals that her late husband was involved with a crime family after she recognizes a fellow inmate named Diane. But that isn't the only revelation coming from Elka, for it turns out that she also had a tryst with Rick, the neighbor and The Plain Dealer columnist who tried to seduce Melanie in the first season. In addition, Max's son is running for political office and Elka realises that dating Max could affect his chances because he doesn't want the publicity, so she breaks up with Max. Because of these events, Elka could face more legal problems, prompting her lawyer to suggest that she be declared incompetent so she won't stand trial, which proves to be a disaster because her lawyer becomes a chick magnet for Melanie, Joy and Victoria. Max dates and prepares to marry another woman, but Elka fights back and both Elka and Max became a couple again. However, Elka's romantic problems take on a lot more problems when Max decides to leave for Florida and asks her to come with him. After deliberating on it, she agrees, but when she sees his shrine to his late wife, she concludes that Max is not ready to marry again and consequently breaks things off with him for good, returning home to face her trial with the support of the girls. She is later found guilty and flees the house to avoid her sentencing, leaving a goodbye note for the girls. Meanwhile, Joy learns that her son has decided to not see her just yet, but that's the least of her problems: She just learned that the INS plans to deport her back to England, so she must find a way to get a green card... which is where Rick comes in. Although she does accept his offer of \\"marriage\\" (knowing that Rick still plans to be a \\"player\\"), this unusual relationship and Rick's plan to use this ruse to bed other women would be ruined when Rick tried to smooth talk their immigration lawyer. On top of that, she tells Elka after being arrested by Pete for taking money in a rummage sale drug deal (she sold a guy Victoria's \\"chill pills\\") that she was a shoplifter as a teenager. Her love life also takes a weird turn when she finds out a guy she thought was into her really just wants Joy to babysit his son while he dates a different woman, which gives Joy the idea of wanting to have another child. She also had a past relationship with actor Michael E. Knight, whom she despises because he never called after a one-night stand she had with him. This revelation and the fake wedding could also mean more problems for the eyebrow specialist and her attempts to stay in the United States. But thanks to a last-minute deal from the governor's wife, oddly after she accused Joy of being a hooker during Elka's trial, Joy is given a green card to stay in the country, and negotiates for Elka to be cleared of all charges as well once she is brought home from masquerading as a nun in the west. During a panic situation where the girls are scared about a criminal whom Victoria wooed under Joy's name possibly breaking into their house, Joy accidentally shoots a man by tossing Elka's gun; which is loaded and instantly shoots the leg of the man, who turns out to be her long-lost son, Owen, to whom she reluctantly introduces herself. At first, Owen wants nothing to do with Joy based on her crazy life, but he eventually relents and the two build up a mother-son relationship. As Joy mulls over her options to conceive at a fertility clinic, she ends up having casual sex with Rick, who turns out to be a sperm donor at the clinic. When Melanie finds out about this, she urges Joy to end it with Rick. Melanie, on the other hand, can't forgive her cop- boyfriend Pete for arresting Elka, but the two do kiss and make up, although his mother has made it known that she does not like Melanie. To add insult to injury, Melanie also finds out that Hank, the married plumber she met back in the first season, is Pete's older brother and still has feelings for her. Elka blurts out information on Melanie's past exploits with Hank at a bar, which simultaneously ends Melanie's relationship with Pete while costing Hank his marriage after his wife witnessed it all. She later finds another guy, a doctor named Aaron. In addition, Melanie visits her home in Los Angeles as it is locked up in legal limbo, and pines for the good days she and her family had in that residence. She is finally able to sell the home while realizing she must move on. Financial problems are also taking a toll on Victoria, who has just learned that her financial advisor was arrested on embezzlement charges and as a result, is now broke and has her assets frozen, leaving her trying to get herself out of debt and hopefully keep her sanity. An example of that comes when she shows up at a bar with a very old, wheelchair-bound billionaire, but he collapses during their first night out and demands to be taken home. In addition, she learns at a movie audition that she will be playing Melanie Griffith's mother, which results in the two having a cat fight (that is caught on tape), and later manages to land a job on All My Children alongside rival actress Susan Lucci in the wake of Victoria winning a Daytime Emmy award over Lucci in the first season. Unfortunately, Lucci seeks revenge by screwing with Victoria during their scenes together, which is thwarted by Joy threatening to sue the producers. She finally lands a regular job as a feature reporter at a local news station, despite the role initially being a bad fit for her. Whilst discussing hooking up with friends with no strings attached, Elka starts a casual fling with an old friend, Fred, but she falls in love with him as the relationship quickly becomes serious and decides to propose to him. She changes her mind, but when Fred falls down a well and is subsequently rescued, he then asks Elka to marry him. The season finale revolves around Elka trying to find a sign from her late husband that it is okay to marry Fred, while Joy and Victoria learn that they married each other in Canada during an alcohol-induced stupor on the night of Elka's bachelorette party. But on the day of the wedding, Elka is shocked when not only Max arrives to stop the wedding, but also another man named Bobby proclaims that neither Max nor Fred can marry her, as he is her \\"dead\\" husband, leaving the season on a cliffhanger.

No live wires are exposed. Padmounted transformers in Taiwan. A padmount or pad- mounted transformer is a ground mounted electric power distribution transformer in a locked steel cabinet mounted on a concrete pad. Since all energized connection points are securely enclosed in a grounded metal housing, a padmount transformer can be installed in places that do not have room for a fenced enclosure. Padmount transformers are used with underground electric power distribution lines at service drops, to step down the primary voltage on the line to the lower secondary voltage supplied to utility customers. A single transformer may serve one large building, or many homes. Pad-mounted transformers are made in power ratings from around 15 to around 5000 kVA and often include built-in fuses and switches. Primary power cables may be connected with elbow connectors, which can be operated when energized using a hot stick and allows for flexibility in repair and maintenance.  Design  Pad-mount transformers are available in various electrical and mechanical configurations. Pad-mount transformers operate on medium-voltage distribution systems, up to about 35 kV. The low-voltage winding matches the customer requirement and may be single-phase or three-phase. Pad-mount transformers are (nearly always) oil-filled units and so must be mounted outdoors only. The core and coils are enclosed in a steel oil-filled tank, with terminals for the transformer accessible in an adjacent lockable wiring cabinet. The wiring cabinet has high and low voltage wiring compartments. High and low voltage underground cables from below enter the terminal compartments directly. The top of the tank has a cover secured with carriage bolt-nut assemblies. The wiring cabinet has sidewalls on two ends with doors that open sideways to expose the high and low voltage wiring compartments. Pad-mount transformers have self protecting fuses consisting of a bayonet mount fuse placed in a high voltage compartment, with a back-up high energy current limiting fuse in series to protect against secondary faults and transformer overload. The bayonet mount fuse protects against secondary faults and transformer overload and is a field replaceable device. The backup current limiting fuse operates only during transformer failure, therefore it is not field replaceable. These transformers also serve the conventional low voltage fusing requirements. The use of polymeric cable and load break elbows enable switching and isolation to be carried out in the HV chamber in what is known as a \\"dead front\\" environment, i.e. all terminations are fully screened and watertight. Single- and three-phase pad-mounted transformers are used in underground industrial and residential power distribution systems, where there is a need for safe, reliable and aesthetically appealing transformer design. Their enclosed construction allows the installation of pad-mount transformers in public areas without the need of protective fencing. In residential areas, pad-mount transformers are usually located on street easements and supply multiple households. While most traditional pad-mount transformer are fixed on a concrete 'pad', today small single-phase designs are also available with the transformer already mounted on a 'polypad' base so that they can be mounted on hard ground, connected, and switched on.

Financial management is nowadays increasingly referred to as \\"Strategic Financial Management\\" so as to give it an increased frame of reference. To understand what strategic financial management is about, we must first understand what is meant by the term \\"Strategic\\". Which is something that is done as part of a plan that is meant to achieve a particular purpose. Therefore, Strategic Financial Management are those aspect of the overall plan of the organisation that concerns financial managers. This includes different parts of the business plan, for example marketing and sales plan, production plan, personnel plan, capital expenditure, etc. These all have financial implications for the financial managers of an organisation. The objective of the Financial Management is the maximisation of shareholders wealth. To satisfy this objective a company requires a \\"long term course of action\\" and this is where strategy fits in.  Strategic planning  Strategic planning is an organisation‚Äôs process to outlining and defining its strategy, direction it is going. This led to decision making and allocation of resources inline with this strategy. Some techniques used in strategic planning includes: SWOT analysis, PEST analysis, STEER analysis. Often it is a plan for one year but more typically 3 to 5 years if a longer term view is taken.  Component of a financial strategy  When making a financial strategy, financial managers need to include the following basic elements. More elements could be added, depending on the size and industry of the project. Startup cost: For new business ventures and those started by existing companies. Could include new fabricating equipment costs, new packaging costs, marketing plan. Competitive analysis: analysis on how the competition will affect your revenues. Ongoing costs: Includes labour, materials, equipment maintenance, shipping and facilities costs. Needs to be broken down into monthly numbers and subtracted from the revenue forecast (see below). Revenue forecast: over the length of the project, to determine how much will be available to pay the ongoing cost and if the project will be profitable. ALWAYS SURE  Role of a financial manager  Broadly speaking, financial managers have to have decisions regarding 4 main topics within a company. Those are as follow: * Investment decisions - Regarding the long and short term investment decisions. For example: the most appropriate level and mix of assets a company should hold. * Financing decisions - concerns the optimal levels of each financing source - E.g. Debt - Equity ratio. * Liquidity decisions - Involves the current assets and liabilities of the company - one function is to maintain cash reserves. * Dividend decisions - Disbursement of dividend to shareholders and retained earnings.  Decision making  Each decisions made by financial managers must be strategic sound and not only have benefits financially (e.g. Increasing value on the Discounted Cash Flow Analysis) but must also consider uncertain, unquantifiable factors which could be strategically beneficial. To explain this further, a proposal could have a negative impact from the Discounted Cash Flow analysis, but if it is strategically beneficial to the company this decision will be accepted by the financial managers over a decision which has a positive impact on the Discounted Cash Flow analysis but is not strategically beneficial.  Investment decisions  For a financial manager in an organisation this will be mainly regarding the selection of assets which funds from the firm will be invested in. These assets will be acquired if they are proven to be strategically sound and assets are classified into 2 classifications: * Long term assets - also known as Capital Budgeting for financial managers. * Short term assets/current assets. * Profitability Management.  Long term assets: capital budgeting investment decisions  Financial managers in this field must select assets or an investment proposals which provides a beneficial course of action, that will most likely come in the future and over the lifetime of the project. This is one of the most crucial financial decisions for a firm.  Short term assets investment decisions  Important for short term survival of the organisation; thus prerequisite for long term success; mainly concerning the management of current assets that‚Äôs held on the company‚Äôs balance sheet.  Profitability management  As a more minor role under this section; it comes under investment decisions because revenue generated will be from investments and divestments.  Evaluation  Under each of the above headings: financial managers have to use the following financial figures as part of the evaluation process to determine if a proposal should be accepted. Payback period with NPV (Net Present Value), IRR (internal rate of return) and DCF (Discounted Cash Flow).  Financing decisions  For a financial managers, they have to decide the financing mix, capital structure or leverage of a firm. Which is the use of a combination of equity, debt or hybrid securities to fund a firm's activities, or new venture.  Decision making  Financial manager often uses the Theory of capital structure to determine the ratio between equity and debt which should be used in a financing round for a company. The basis of the theory is that debt capital used beyond the point of minimum weighted average cost of capital will cause devaluation and unnecessary leverage for the company. The equation of working out the average cost of capital can be found on the right. Where: Re = cost of equity thumb|245x245pxWeighted Average Cost Of Capital. Rd = cost of debt E = market value of the firm's equity D = market value of the firm's debt V = E + D E/V = percentage of financing that is equity D/V = percentage of financing that is debt Tc = corporate tax rate  Liquidity and working capital decisions  The role of a financial manager often includes making sure the firm is liquid ‚Äì the firm is able to finance itself in the short run, without running out of cash. They also have to make the firm‚Äôs decision in investing into current assets: which can generally be defined as the assets which can be converted into cash within one accounting year, which includes cash, short term securities debtors, etc. The main indicator to be used here is the net working capital: which is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. Being able to be positive and negative, indicating the companies current financial position and the health of the balance sheet. This can be further split into:  Receivables management  Which includes investment in receivables that is the volume of credit sales, and collection period. Credit policy which includes credit standards, credit terms and collection efforts.  Inventory management  Which are stocks of manufactured products and the material that make up the product, which includes raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, stores and spares (supplies). For a retail business, for example, this will be a major component of their current assets.  Cash management  Concerned with the management of cash flow in and out of the firm, within the firm, and cash balances held by the firm at a point of time by financing deficit or investing surplus cash.  Dividend decisions  Financial managers often have to influence the dividend to 2 outcomes: The ratio as which this is distributed is called the dividend-pay out ratio. * Distribute to the shareholder in the form of dividends * Retain in the business itself This is largely dependent on the preference of the shareholders and the investment opportunities available within the firm. But also on the theory that there must be a balance between the pay out to satisfy shareholders for them to continue to invest in the company. But the company will also need to retain profits to be reinvested so more profits can be made for the future. This is also beneficial to the shareholders for growth in the value of shares and for increased dividends paid out in the future. This infers that it is important for management and shareholders to agree to a balanced ratio which both sides can benefit from, in the long term. Although this is often an exception for shareholders who only wish to hold for the short term dividend gain.

The protagonists of the lyrics, Junichiro and Ishtar, are a modern version of Fando y Lis (first work of Alejandro Jodorowsky) chasing the legendary city called Tar on a David Lynch‚Äôs Lost Highway. The sound is the soundtrack to this imaginary film. The presence of electro-clash beats, lysergic desert rock guitars and the unusual use of the voice sometimes played from a busted grammophone give a decadent sound, in which the figures appear faded and where the substance is tinged with noir and the mind is lost forfeited in a thick consistency sensory tunnel where the end is distant and blurred. Metal Wave - Interview The voice is used as an instrument that fits the metric and the tone with the mood of the texts. Pi Greco explored the research on the voice of Demetrio Stratos and the cut-up method of William Burroughs. Puns and variations of the pronunciation are used to create a grotesque effect and to reveal hidden words or concepts: there are dialogues hidden in the mix and hidden messages encrypted in the playing time of songs.

From Melbourne, Goulstone moved on to Queensland, and lived for about three years in a small place called Darling Downs, where he ran his own business. However, he had to leave the locality on account of his health. On 11 May 1860 Goulstone arrived in Sydney, having sailed from Brisbane on the ship the Telegraph of Sydney.New South Wales State Mariner Records Just over a week later on 19 May he married Mary Sayer Cox.New South Wales Marriage Certificate Registration Number 1860/000983 Their first child, Newton Henry Goulstone, was born on 1 July 1861, at Belgrave Terrace, Sydney.Colony of New South Wales Birth Certificate Register Number 1410 On 5 August 1861 Goulstone started work at the head office in Sydney of the Bank of New South Wales.Bank of New South Wales 'Register of Officers' and ‚ÄòBoard Minutes‚Äô Sometime between August and January the family moved to Auckland, New Zealand and on 4 January 1862, Goulstone was appointed as the Acting Accountant, Bank of New South Wales, Auckland, at a salary of ¬£300 per annum.

Within six months, virtually the entire illiterate population of Tirurangadi was in her class. Though her work deteriorated her physical condition, she moved forward, garnering support from both the public at large and the authorities. In June 1992, state authorities and officials visited her classroom and were surprised to see a child of 8 studying alongside an 80-year-old woman. Upon receiving her complaints about the lack of basic infrastructure at her village, the District Collector sanctioned roads, electricity, telephone and water connection for her village. The one-and-a-half km road was aptly named Akshara (word) Road. She later started a volunteer organisation, Chalanam (motion), and continues to serve as its President. It runs six schools for the physically disabled and for mentally retarded children. The organisation also promotes health awareness, and runs schools, health clubs, continuing education programmes, training for women, and rehabilitation of the physically disabled. Its activities also include inspiring public awareness against alcoholism, dowry, family feuds, superstition and communalism. It also established small-scale manufacturing unit for women, a women's library and a youth club in the educationally backward village of Vellilakkadu. Her efforts played an important part in eliminating illiteracy in Kerala. She also involved herself in the \\"Akshaya: Bridging the Digital Divide\\" project that made 'Malappuram the first E-Literate district in India. Personal struggles After the polio about paralysed her below the waist, she continued to move around in a wheelchair. But a few years later in 2000, she was diagnosed with cancer making things much more difficult for her. She successfully underwent chemotherapy at Amala Hospital, Thrissur. While at the hospital, she counselled other patients and instilled hope in them for their future. In 2002, she went for the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca and performed the Hajj, fulfilling her longtime dream.http://thatsmalayalam.oneindia.in/news/2002/02/22/wo-hajj.html By 2004, she had returned to her work, but another tragedy struck her. She slipped on the floor of her bathroom breaking her spinal vertebral column, bringing her movements to a virtual halt. She was partially paralysed below the neck. Later, due to the non-functioning of muscles, she had to resign to a life with urine bag. As she lay on the waterbed, trying to cope up with the pain and inability, she started writing her memories on pages of notebooks using colour pencil. Despite the odds, she still continues her work alongside 100 other volunteers at Chalanam with continued determination.

He decided the European Cup in 2009 for himself and secured his starting place for the 2010/11 World Cup after Andr√© Lange's retirement. Although he was ranked below fellow German drivers Karl Angerer and Thomas Florsch√ºtz, he dominated the difficult track in Whistler in a surprise victory in the two-man bobsled with his brakeman Andreas Bredau in his World Cup debut. At the following World Cup stop in Calgary, he celebrated his maiden victory in the four-man race with his pushers Makarow, Bredau and Poser. On February 20, 2011 he won silver in two-man at the World Championships K√∂nigssee, finishing 0.18 seconds behind Alexsandr Zubkov from Russia. His crowning event was the four- man World Championships on February 27, 2011, where he finished first and became World Champion. In March 2014 Machata received a 5,000 Euro fine and a one year ban from the Bob- und Schlittenverband f√ºr Deutschland (BSD) after lending a set of bobsled runners to Russian bobsledder Alexander Zubkov in exchange for a fee. In October 2015 the BSD announced that Machata had retired from competition.

By time Wight published Bourne's book, he was primarily a publisher, and became part of a monopoly for printing law books in 1599. He published many of the first printed English law books, including Fulbeck (1600), discussing study methods for law students, techniques for arguing a case, and suggestions for further reading. Pulton (1600), also published by Wight the same year, was the first book to attempt to summarise English criminal law. Fulbecke (1602) was one of the first books on international law. Saint German (1604) was first published in Latin in 1523, and attempts to describe English law through a dialogue between a churchman and a student of English common law. It ponders the nature of law, its religious and moral standards, and jurisdiction of Parliament. Manwood (1598) summarises the laws of the forest, known as Carta de Foresta; this was of key interest to English gentlemen, and went through numerous reprintings. Kitchin (1598) described manorial law, land law, and agrarian law. Wight published copies of the \\"Yearbooks\\", notes by law students which were the earliest English legal reports dating back to the eleventh century.Holdsworth, A History of English Law V: 357‚Äì377; Marvin, Legal Bibliography (1847) 756.

A New Account of the Tales of the World, also known as Shishuo Xinyu (), was compiled and edited by Liu Yiqing (Liu I-ching; ÂäâÁæ©ÊÖ∂; 403‚Äì444) during the Liu Song dynasty (420‚Äì479) of the Northern and Southern dynasties (420‚Äì589). It is a historical compilation of many Chinese scholars, musicians, and artists during the 2nd-4th centuries.  Content  The book contains around 1,130 historical anecdotes and character sketches of around 600 literati, musicians and painters who lived in the Han and Wei‚ÄìJin periods (2nd-4th centuries). Chapter 19, for instance, has 32 stories about outstanding women. It is thus both a biographical source and a record of colloquial language. The original text of the book was divided into eight volumes of juan (Âç∑ \\"scroll\\"), though current editions generally span ten volumes.Endymion Wilkinson. Chinese History: A New Manual. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph Series New Edition; Second, Revised printing March 2013, ), p. 732.NJ Museum  Historical accuracy  Although most of the anecdotes and personalities are attested in other sources, traditional Chinese bibliographers did not classify Shishuo Xinyu as history but as a novel / \\"minor talk\\" (Â∞èËØ¥ xiao shuo), a term that was later used to refer to fiction. Some attribute this to its use of colloquial language as well as how it did not follow the historical conventions of the Twenty-Four Histories. The mixture of literary and vernacular styles set the scene for the later tradition of informal Chinese literature. The 20th-century Chinese novelist Lu Xun also spoke highly of the book's aesthetic merits.Shitong, see Liu Zhiji  Translations  The text has been translated in full into English, with the Liang dynasty (502‚Äì557) commentary by Liu Xiaobiao (ÂäâÂ≠ùÊ®ô), in Richard B.

The system was used between 1863 and 1874. Background Testing at Battersea Sir Rowland Hill of the General Post Office commissioned two engineers to investigate the feasibility of a pneumatic tube-based system between the General Post Office and the West District Central Post Office.The International Year Book. Dodd, Mead & Company, 1899 In 1855 and 1856 they reported favourably but there would be significant cost. The scheme was not progressed. In 1859 Thomas Webster Rammell and Josiah Latimer Clark proposed an underground tube network in central London \\"for the more speedy and convenient circulation of despatches and parcels\\".Atmospheric Railways, Charles Hadfield, 1967. The company was founded in 1859 with offices at 6 Victoria Street, Westminster. Capital of ¬£150,000 was sought through 15,000 shares at ¬£10 each. The company's directors were its chairman Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, deputy chairman Mark Huish, Thomas Brassey, Edwin Clark, the Hon. William Napier, John Horatio Lloyd, William Henry Smith and Sir Charles Henry John Rich. With initial funding of ¬£25,000 (¬£ in ), the company tested the technology and constructed a pilot route at the Soho Foundry of Boulton and Watt in Birmingham.The Atmospheric Railways, Francis Howard Clayton, 1966 The first full-scale trial was at Battersea during the summer of 1861.Wells Journal - Saturday 3 August 1861 A single tube was installed, 452 yards long, with curves of up to radius and gradients of up to 1 in 22. narrow gauge track was cast inside the tube. Wheeled capsules were fitted with vulcanised rubber flaps to make an air seal. Power was provided by a 30 horse-power steam engine with a diameter fan. Single capsules weighed up to 3 tonnes, and achieved speeds up to 40 mph (60 km/h). Operation First dispatch of mail bags through the pneumatic tube from the district office in Eversholt Street to Euston Station. Illustrated London News, 28 February 1863 A permanent line of narrow gauge was constructed between Euston railway station and the North West District Post Office in Eversholt Street, a distance of approximately a third of a mile. The line was tested from 15 January 1863, and operation started on 20 February 1863. A capsule conveying up to 35 bags of mail could make the short journey between terminals in one minute. Thirteen journeys were operated each day, with a daily operating cost of ¬£1 4s 5d. The Post Office was charged a nominal fee for use of the service, presumably to encourage them to accept the technology.\\"Pneumatic Dispatch\\". Alfred E. Beach. American News Company. New York. 1868. A journalist made a report on the first scheme at Euston: The company sought to develop further lines within London, and attempted to raise an additional ¬£125,000 (¬£ in ), of capital. The prospectus proposed a network of lines between \\"points so important that it is unnecessary to dwell upon the magnitude of the traffic that must naturally arise between them\\". The first line was to have been a route linking the Camden Town and Euston (Square) stations of the London and North Western Railway. receipt for purchase of 18 shares in the Pneumatic Desptach Company at @ ¬£1 each Work started on a narrow gauge line from Euston to Holborn in September 1863.Atmospheric Railways, David and Charles Hadfield, 1967. The tubes were constructed by the Staveley Coal and Iron Company.Gentleman's Magazine. Volume 218 The first 'trains' ran on 10 October 1865 after a demonstration in which the chairman, Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, travelled from Holborn to Euston in one of the capsules. Another line from Holborn to Gresham Street via the General Post Office on St Martin's le Grand was under construction in 1865. By the time of the 1866 financial crisis caused by the Overend, Gurney and Company collapse, a ‚Öú mile tube from Holborn to Hatton Garden had been constructed. Total expenditure so far was ¬£150,000 (¬£ in ).

Capsules from the General Post Office reached Newgate Street within 17 minutes, at speeds of up to 60 mph. The Post Office made several trials of the system, but there were not substantial time savings to be made, and by 1874, the Post Office abandoned its use, and the company went into liquidation in 1875.Mails under London, L.C. Stanway. 2000 The Edinburgh Evening News reported in 1876 that the trucks containing the parcels continually stuck in the tunnels, and this was the reason for the failure of the company.Edinburgh Evening News - Monday 2 October 1876 In late 1921, an agreement was reached between the Pneumatic Despatch Company and the Postmaster General for the sale (for ¬£7,500) of the remaining infrastructure of \\"the tube\\" to the Postmaster General. The agreement recognised that \\"the Company has not for many years past worked the tube and the same is not now in working order\\" and that various persons had made unauthorised breaches in the tube as originally constructed. The agreement was confirmed by the Post Office (Pneumatic Tubes) Act 1922,12 & 13 Geo. 5. Chapter 43. which also repealed enactments from 1859, 1864 and 1872 authorising the company.

Description  The Geezer Bandit is suspected to be a white male between the ages of 60‚Äì70 years old who is between 5'10\\" and 6'0\\" and between 190 and 200 lb with an average build and, judging from footage and eyewitness accounts, he is left-handed.  Modus operandi  The Geezer Bandit comes into the bank like a normal customer, approaches the teller with a leather case, and then draws a revolver from the case and demands money from the teller by handing the teller a note. A teller who was one of the 13 people to have direct contact with the Geezer Bandit stated on America's Most Wanted that she was given a note that read, \\"Give me $50,000 or I will murder you.\\"  Theories  The man appears to be in his mid- to late seventies; however, some members of law enforcement have stated their beliefs that he may not be an elderly man. One theory is that the man is a master of disguise and is using a silicone mask. The string of robberies started in August 2009 in San Diego, California. The FBI has started to question makers of special effects masks to get insight into the Geezer Bandit robberies. This comes in part after a white male in Ohio pleaded guilty to robbing banks in a mask that made him look like a black male. Interest in realistic theatrical disguise also increased after a young East Asian man was able to board a plane from Hong Kong to Canada wearing the mask of an elderly white male. John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted, believes the Geezer Bandit is actually a young person in disguise due to surveillance footage of his latest robbery, which showed him running abnormally fast for an elderly person after a dye pack exploded in the money bag he had.

Copycat An apparent copycat of the Geezer Bandit made an appearance in an attempt to replicate the robbery tactic. In an attempt to pull off a robbery, the fake Geezer Bandit was not careful in his getaway, and ended up in police custody. The police do not believe he is the real Geezer Bandit. Fanbase The Geezer Bandit has a following that has started several Facebook pages showing support for him and his crime spree. Several news media outlets have reported that many people are trying to capitalize on the fan draw of the Geezer Bandit by making \\"Geezer Bandit\\" T-shirts imprinted with a picture of the felon from surveillance images of his robberies. On the February 5, 2011, episode of America's Most Wanted, one fan-made shirt read: :GEEZER BANDIT :is my name :GETTIN' AWAY :is my game  Theme Song  A song called \\"Nothing to Lose\\" written and performed by Paul King was written after he heard about a bank robber in Florida in 2004 that was the first Geezer Bandit.

He signed the strips RB. Fuller.McMaster, Jane. \\"Fuller's Oaky Doaks At 15-Year Mark\\". Editor & Publisher, 1950.  Biography   Early life and education  Born in Capac, Michigan,Who's Who in American Art Fuller was the oldest child of six children born to Louise and Arthur Fuller. The Fuller family lived in Richmond, Michigan, where his father was a druggist. He was 16 when he sold his first cartoon to Life for $8. In the following mail, he received a letter from Life requesting the return of the $8 because they had previously used that gag. He did send back the $8. However, he soon sold Life another cartoon and followed with contributions to the New York World's Fun supplement in 1910.Marschall, Rick. \\"When Knights Were Bold But Moreso the Damsels... Oaky Doaks\\", Nemo, the Classic Comics Library 20 (July 1986). Fuller studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and went to work as a staff artist for the Chicago Daily News. While he was at the Daily News, he received $100 for the first color picture ever published by Life. That triggered a desire to work in magazine illustration, and he moved to New York, where he lived at 17 Livingston Street. After a 1914 trip to England, Fuller and his wife Alexa lived at 217 East 16th Street in Brooklyn. By 1920, the couple and their children Robert and Elizabeth were living at 170 Ames Avenue in Leonia, New Jersey.  Magazine cartoonist  For years he contributed cartoons to Puck, Judge, Collier's, Harper's, Liberty, Ballyhoo, College Humor and The New Yorker. He had his own feature, Fuller Humor, in Judge during the 1920s. With the collapse of Judge and other humor magazines, Fuller's freelance markets were diminishing, so he considered doing a comic strip. AP Newsfeatures offered him a detective strip, but Fuller wanted to take a humorous approach.Scoop, January 14, 2006. Oaky Doaks In 1935, Fuller had a syndicate offer to take over a top humor strip because it was believed the creator was planning to leave. However, Fuller had a tough decision to make, since AP Newsfeatures was auditioning several artists to draw Oaky Doaks, scripted by the syndicate's comics editor, Bill McCleery. Fuller recalled that AP handed him several pages of Oaky Doaks script to look over. He walked to the Roosevelt Hotel, where he sat in the lobby reading the script. When he finished, he had made his decision; he saw the comic possibilities of Oaky Doaks, and he also would have the opportunity to do a strip displaying his name as the artist. Oaky Doaks was launched on June 17, 1935, many months before the start of Prince Valiant. For two years, Fuller and McCleery collaborated (with no credit given to McCleery as scripter). Fuller eventually took over the writing as well as the art, along with other writing by M. J. Wing.Horn, Maurice. The World Encyclopedia of Comics, Chelsea House, 1984. The Oaky Doaks Sunday strip, which began in 1941, was initially drawn by Bill Dyer (who also worked on The Adventures of Patsy) and later by Fuller. Oaky Doaks visited Camelot in the 1940s, but he later went to the Kingdom of Uncertainia, where he remained until the strip ended in 1961. Fuller was also an accomplished watercolorist and a member of the Leonia, New Jersey art colony.Mattingly, Paul H. Suburban Landscapes. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001. He drew Oaky Doaks from his home in Tenafly, New Jersey, where his studio, painted light green and curtained in gold, overlooked his back lawn. In 1950, he reflected: Oaky Doaks came to an end when the comics division of AP Newsfeatures folded in 1961.

The population in 2011 was 2,915,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 10.07 km2.Eurostat Part of the suburban beltway of Angra, the ecumenical parish (S√£o Pedro) was established by King John VI, who granted it a charter on 6 September 1825, but its borders and administrative organs were confirmed by act of the Civil Governor of Angra ten years later on 26 November 1835. However, according to the testament of Pero Anes do Canto, its establishment as a parish dates back to the 15th century. Terra Ch√£ was the centre of guerrilla activity during the Liberal Wars, as well as a support centre during World War II and later in the Portuguese Colonial war. The role played by the local Hospital Militar da Terra Ch√£ during these periods was instrumental in driving development in the region. History Early settlement Parochial church of Nossa Senhora de Bel√©m da Terra Ch√£ Imp√©rio do Esp√≠rito Santo do Terreiro The earliest document refers to the \\"Charc√£o\\", which is a toponymic derivative of charco (meaning: \\"a standing pool of water, which is not too deep, but filled with a mixture of unfiltered particulates\\"). This may have been a reference to wetlands, probably the first and only native water sources. Initially, the area around the present parish was a source of firewood for many of the residents of the town or settlers along the southern coast. Early colonists to the area that is now Terra Cha (then part of the parish of S√£o Pedro da Angra) were helped by a source of potable water. Ground water from many aquifers in the area, and a sloping landscape, along with the construction of many cisterns, provided a steady source of water, facilitating the colonization of the region (as evidenced from records which refer to the \\"town\\" of Terra Ch√£ during the first century).Greg√≥rio, Rute Duas (2001), p.24 Over time, these small pockets of settlement began to take shape, supported by reliable sources of water and the cultivation of vineyards and orchards. The earliest recorded reference to Terra Ch√£ da Silveira is in the testament of Pero Anes do Canto, who owned lands in this region between 1482 and 1515.Canto, Ernesto de (1883), p.21 His lands covered a large area that extended along the coast, in the parish of S√£o Mateus da Calheta, up to Silveira on the periphery of Angra, and into the interior, to the base of Charc√£o (\\"the cone\\"). Medieval period After 1572, Terra Ch√£ was integrated into the religious parish of S√£o Pedro de Angra, created after the division of the rural areas of the parish of S√© whose lands extended to the northwest in the direction of the island's interior plateau. Consequent to the 1580 Portuguese succession crisis,Sebasti√£o √Ålvares, a rich Angrense merchant, and his wife Gr√°cia Fernandes built a primitive chapel to fulfil their vow to the Virgin of Bel√©m. The legend associated with this vow is linked to the garrison of French troops that was presumably stationed on Terceira to support Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato. On one particular occasion, a group of French soldiers assaulted the home of Sebasti√£o √Ålvares but the family survived without injury. As gratitude for divine intervention from the assault, the wealthy merchant constructed a chapel where, today, the parochial church of Nossa Senhora de Bel√©m is erected. However, the date inscribed on the front fa√ßade of the church (1570), apparently the date of its founding, conflicts with the religious promise made by Sebasti√£o √Ålvares in 1574. In 1674, during the structuring of island administration, Terra Ch√£ was elevated to the status of a religious parish within S√£o Pedro de Angra, with its seat in the Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Bel√©m (still today the centre of parochial life). Even for its small population, the chapel was diminutive and did not permit large services. For this reason, there was a desire for a spacious temple, which made Jo√£o Moniz Corte Real) (a descendant of the original founder) cede lands around the chapel to construct a new church in its place. However, the beginning of the Liberal Wars, in which Corte Real was an important contributor, delayed the building of the new church, and it was only on 21 November 1846 that the cornerstone was placed. The lack of funds slowed its construction throughout the following years, and only in 1857, did the first services occur. Being a densely forested zone with a labyrinth of small roads between its orchards and the residence of a Miguelist supporter (Jo√£o Moniz Corte Real), Terra Ch√£ became a place of refuge for absolutist sympathizers after Liberals took power in the city of Angra. Liberal Wars During the Liberal Wars, a local absolutist resistance movement took shape in Terra Ch√£ against the Liberals, using tenets of guerrilla warfare. It became the centre of the resistance movement during the war. Two guerrillas from Terra Ch√£ became celebrated: Boi Negro () and Rasgado (). Terra Ch√£ was so well known for its guerrillas that Francisco Louren√ßo Valad√£o J√∫nior referred to Terra Ch√£ as the alfobre de guerrilhas (). Some of the events of the guerrilla war are reflected in the toponymic names of the localities in the parish, including Casas Queimadas () and Guerrilhas (). Casas Queimadas was named for an event where the home of Andr√© Machado Lemos, who lived with his family in a ranch along Caminho dos Regatos, was burned down. In 1828, a liberal emissary who travelled to Doze Ribeiras was attacked by a group of guerrillas attempting to seize a dispatch he was carrying. The Liberal took refuge in the home of Andr√© Lemos, and the soldiers attempted to burn down the home with all its contents and occupants. In the end, good sense prevailed on the part of the guerrillas who saved Lemos' family. Consequently, the home was referred locally as the casa queimada: the area name evolving from the place name over time. World War II and Hospital Militar da Terra Ch√£ During World War II, Terra Ch√£ was the centre of hospital services that were established to provide support to the Portuguese Expeditionary Forces, English military forces and American soldiers. The evolution of the Hospital Militar da Terra Ch√£ and its role during the war started when it was constructed in front of the parochial church and became functional on 6 October 1943. The primary purpose of the hospital was to support the Portuguese Expeditionary Forces stationed on the island of Terceira, and English servicemen who disembarked. The hospital facility was further extended to American soldiers who used the installations at Lajes Field. In 1946, with the redeployment of Portuguese Expeditionary and English military forces from Lajes (substituted by the aforementioned American military), the Terra Ch√£ Military Hospital fell under the administration of Air Base No.4, receiving on 9 September 1946 the designation Hospital Militar da BA4 (Terra-Ch√£). This title remained until 13 August 1972, when under Decree No.296/72 14 August,Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 296/72, de 14 de Agosto. the Portuguese Armed Forces reorganized the health care system () and rationalized various other administrative functions. At that time, the hospital was designated the N√∫cleo Hospital Especializado da For√ßa A√©rea 2 (NHEFA2) (). It was the only Portuguese Air Force hospital between 1946 and 1975, when it was de-activated under Decree 525/75, 25 September,Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 525/75, de 25 de Setembro and Air Force services were concentrated in Lumiar, Lisbon, eventually becoming the Air Force Hospital. By the middle of the 1960s, the hospital in Terra Ch√£ was used by military servicemen injured and evacuated from operational theatres of the Portuguese Colonial Wars in Africa. Hundreds of servicemen passed through the institution, which was important in altering the social structure of the parish. Its ranks were visited by notable medics who collaborated with the staff at the hospital in Angra. Among these was the military doctor Viriato Garrett, who arrived in Terceira in 1941 with ensigns from the militia, and who worked almost exclusively at the Angra Hospital since its founding. His activity as surgeon was particularly intense after 1957, when he joined the ranks of the Portuguese Air Force (FAP). He was promoted to Medical Captain and stationed at Air Base No.4, where he remained until the closing of the institution, becoming director of the Hospital after 1966. Following the war, during the 1960s, it served to treat defence forces returning from the Portuguese Colonial Wars in Africa. Following the closure of the Hospital in 1966, the military hospital building served as a refuge for displaced colonial troops ( as they were referred) returning from the independent colonies. But by 1976, the building was transferred to the newly established Instituto Universitario dos A√ßores () to serve as its Angra Campus. In 2004, the campus was transferred to new facilities in Pico da Urze, and the building transformed into a technological park affiliated with the university.

Geography The centre of Terra Ch√£ is situated northwest of the municipal seat, along the southern part of the island of Terceira. Located to the south of Angra do Hero√≠smo, the island capital, the parish of Terra Cha parish, was considered one of the most prosperous regions of the island in the 19th century due to its rich fertile lands and notable country houses of the nobility of the region. An area of irregular flat land, it is one of the few landlocked parishes on Terceira and in the Azores, with no discernible natural limits, situated at the base of the Serra do Charc√£o (an area locally designated on the southwest flanks of the Caldeira de Guilherme Moniz Massif). Without any coastal frontiers, it is delimited by its borders with the parishes of S√£o Mateus da Calheta and S√£o Pedro; to the west, northwest and north by the parish of S√£o Bartolomeu de Regatos; and northeast and east by Posto Santo and Santa Luzia. Physical geography A view of Terra Ch√£, as seen from the Miradouro das Veredas, with the flank of Serra da Santa B√°rbara on the right The territory was formed by mostly basaltic magma within the last 100,000 years. Fissural eruptions around the area of Pico da Bagacina produced fluid lava that flowed to the coast of the island. The accumulation of successive flows produced a planar landscape with a surface covered in clinker geology. This layer was a combination of lightly dense lapilli and pyroclastic deposits that originated from the small cones in the immediate vicinity of the parish, namely Pico da Urze and Pico da Boa Hora. As a consequence of the genesis, the soils are exclusively arid or semi-arid regosols, with a predominance of sedimentary basalts resulting in the easy degradation of clinker topography, known more commonly as biscoitos (in the Azores) or breccia. The exceptions to this occur along the flanks of Charc√£o and the upper altitudes around Veredas and Matela, zones of older rock (greater than 3 million year), composed of trachybasalt and trachyte that correspond to the formation of the Guilherme Moniz-Cinco Picos volcanic complexes. This zone, which follows a visible contour in the transition to the flatter parts of the parish, corresponds to the coast of the proto-island of Terceira and is marked by weathering, presented by some boulder formations typical of trachybasalt evolution of the landscape. It is covered primarily by pyroclastic trachytes, derived from the great eruptions after the post-caldera eruptions in the Serra da Santa B√°rbara, and local activity around Matela, where a dense layer of pumice affected hydrothermal circulation. These local soils are more evolved, deep, and primarily andosols. This genesis and geomorphology in Terra Ch√£ resulted in two types of landscapes: * A planar region (where the population is located) with a gentle incline of less than 3% that extends toward the north- northwest direction between the extreme south of Canada de Bel√©m and the area around Pico da Bagacina. Soils are poor in this region, essentially breccia, very porous and, for that reason, deprived of functional water courses. This is an area of little agricultural value, but still, occupied at its lower limits by orchards and pasture which include Eucalyptus globulus and Pittosporum undulatum that have survived since the middle of the 20th century. The higher altitudes constitute poorer, semi-natural lands that have been used traditionally for the raising of bulls; * A minor region, in the northeast of the parish, that corresponds to the western flank of the Guilherme Moniz massif (Charco) and a plateau in the area of Veredas/Matela, which has an accented relief, composed of p≈´mex and soil, that is easily transportable and of relative agricultural value. The region itself, due to its altitude and sloping landscape does not support settlement, but its soils are arable and occupied by a majority of the better pasturelands in the region. In areas with steeper inclines or that have experienced significant hydrothermal circulation (around Matela primarily), there exist patches of forest dominated by Cryptomeria japonica, as well as a stand of old-growth laurissilva forest. Human geography The urban structure is a mixed pattern of use, with a linear alignment typical of older rural Terceirense areas established around historical roads. Its roadways flow from the Port√µes de S√£o Pedro towards Boa Hora and link the city of Angra to Doze Ribeiras, in addition to the settlements in the southwest and west of the island (the old Caminho de Cima, today the Estrada Municipal E.M.501). Onto this network are natural patches of relatively urbanized settlements, constituted of recently constructed residential zones (mostly built after the 1980 earthquake) and of a markedly suburban character. This structure has resulted in the following nuclei: *Boa Hora ‚Äì a settlement located along a road from Angra, that splits off to the west (in the direction of Doze Ribeiras) and to the north (towards Pedregal on the way to Posto Santo, Veredes and the centre of the island). It is an old centre, with many historic buildings that were homes to important burgher families of Angra. It has its own Imp√©rio to the Holy Spirit, site of annual festivals and community life; *Bel√©m ‚Äì the oldest place and most centrally located parish, developed linearly along the Caminho de Cima (Estrada Municipal E.M.501), and including access to Bel√©m-Largo da Igreja-Caminho de Bel√©m-Terreiro-Dois Caminhos. This settlement is the centre of the parish, site of the parochial Church of Nossa Senhora de Bel√©m, the Imp√©rio do Esp√≠rito Santo de Terreiro and parish seat for a number of institutions, including Junta de Freguesia, Casa do Povo, primary school and kindergarten, Campus of the University of the Azores (the old Military Hospital Air Base No.4) and the recreational centre. Various manors punctuate this agglomeration, giving it a distinct character along the urban periphery; *Bairro da Terra Ch√£ ‚Äì situated south of the parochial church and west of the Canada de Bel√©m, it includes the residents in the Canada de Bel√©m and Canada do Rolo, which grew from the neighbourhood () constructed to house residents after the 1 January 1980 earthquake, and subsequently improved and expanded. Today it is a principal residential nucleus of the parish, with Imp√©rio and community centre, but functions as more of a bedroom community of Angra, whose population are largely recent transplants. The Canada de Bel√©m is the older nucleus, having evolved linearly along the main road that connects the parish church along the Caminho do Meio and Caminho de Baixo (in S√£o Mateus da Calheta), having its own Imp√©rio since 1959; *Fonte Faneca ‚Äì another nucleus of a linear character, it developed along the road that splits into Dois Caminhos and extends into the interior of the island. It is an older consolidated agglomeration, although there has been a great deal of growth over the past decade, due to the improved accessibility to Angra; *Ladeiras e Guerrilhas ‚Äì concentrated along the roadway between Dois Caminhos and the parish frontier with S√£o Bartolomeu de Regatos, in addition to the area in Caminho de Cima (between Dois Caminhos and Guerrilhas), this locality includes the higher altitude Canada da Francesa, adding a suburban character to the zone. Being the more elevated part of the parish, it includes scrub and forests of Eucalyptus and Incense, and was traditionally inhabited by woodsmen and shepherds tending to wild cattle. The parish of Terra Ch√£ has an extensive number of farms, which have historically been the place of residence and holiday homes of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy of Angra do Hero√≠smo. The estates of these landlords were made up of a house, large yards with manicured gardens, orchards, vineyards, pastures and water fountains. Example of these properties include Solar dos Corvelos, Quinta de Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, Quinta da Boa Hora, Quinta das Casas (Quinta de Santa Luzia), Quinta dos Sim√µes, Quinta dos Prazeres, Quinta de Nossa Senhora da Guia and Quinta Viana, in addition to other estates along Canada do Fisher (Pedregal), the Quinta do Loura (Quinta do Boi Negro) and √Årvore Grande (Canada de Bel√©m). Demographics The first census in Terra Ch√£ was conducted in 1864. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\" } Demographically, the parish of Terra Ch√£ (as with other communities on the island of Terceira) was marked by emigration, first to Brazil, then to the United States and finally to Canada. Also, the 1 January 1980 earthquake, which caused major damage on the island, triggered a wave of resettlements into Terra Ch√£. The effect of this demographic shift into the parish, caused by the resettlements into the Bairro da Terra Ch√£, are visible in the numbers after 1991 when the population of the parish almost doubled. It is located at an average elevation of 23 metres () above sea level.Statistics from INE (2001); geographic detail from Instituto Geogr√°fico Portugu√™s (2010) Economy Close to town and situated in an area of poor land, the economy of Terra Ch√£ has always been based on three sectors, which have been alternating in dominance over time. These are the cultivation of land and forestry activities (first, with the supply of firewood and timber to the city, then with the cultivation of vineyards and orchards), wild cattle grazing and bullfighting, and finally the service sector (which in recent decades has increased dramatically), especially tourism and hotel services. The provision of kindling and wood, from the forests of the parish and from the hinterland of the Serra de Santa B√°rbara, was an important economic activity until the last part of the 20th century, making Terra Ch√£ a principal community of woodsmen on the island. The fabrication and provision of axes and sawmills, which reached appreciable dimensions, occupied an important part of the population of the parish. Wood would be transported by bull carts to the centre of Angra for sale, or prepared in artesian sawmills located in the hinterlands, before being sent to town to be used in construction, or carpentry. Soil conditions, which did not permit easy cultivation, did allow the growth of grape fields in the lower parts of the parish and intermediary orchards. Although the area was humid, and not adequate for wine production, the cultivation of large tracts between Canada do Rolo and Boa Hora, and by manors around the Canada and Caminho de Bel√©m persisted. The presence of vineyards explains the structure of lands (their preponderance in small parcels and limited by hedgerows) and the existence of small buildings that acted as wine cellars. The decline of the wine culture began in the first decades of the 19th century, in part caused by problems in preserving plants infected by powdery mildew, but also by the growth in the lucrative exportation of oranges to the United Kingdom. A good part of the vineyards were transformed into orange orchards. This transformation, and the resulting prosperity, gave origin to the construction of opulent manors. In addition to the orange, the orchards of Terra Ch√£ also served a variety of fruit to the city of Angra, and the ships that docked in its ports. The loss of the orange's competitiveness in the Azores (due to falling prices in England) and the concordant appearance of citrus diseases, forced the end of the lucrative business, causing most orchards to begin cultivating other fruits, sawmilling or reverting to the production of low-grade vineyards for public consumption. By the middle of the 19th century, the orange business had almost completely disappeared. The appearance of a chestnut industry then influenced the economy of Terra Ch√£, with the cultivation of extensive pasturelands with Viana Chestnut, which transformed itself into an emblem of the region, even to this day. Another important area of activity in Terra Ch√£, which gave the parish the sobriquet title of terra dos pastores (), was the raising and breeding of wild cattle. In the higher altitudes, above the Charc√£o and around Pico da Bagacina, there developed a lucrative bull-breeding business pioneered by a few rural gentry from Angra. These promoters and provisioners of animals for the island's traditional bullfighting () contracted men from the parish to raise their animals, attaining a notoriety on the island's bullfighting scene. The bull-breeding industry attained a level of sophistication at the beginning of the 20th century, through the influence of the Corvelo and Barcelos whom conquered the market for the purposes of Terceiran bullfighting. These cattle families would regularly transport their animals to holding pens through the streets of the village. The cattlemen would direct them down the Canada dos Pomares, Canada do Loural, Canada do Negro, Atalho das Lajes and Caminho do T√≠o Patr√≠cio, before they would be used in the traditional events. After an intense period of emigration to the United States and Canada, which reached its peak in the 1960s, the 1980 earthquake profoundly altered the socio- economic balance of the parish, destroying the social veil that had existed. The construction of the Bairro da Terra Ch√£ in lands that were originally intended for the Universidade dos A√ßores, for re-settlement of displaced families who had lost their homes in the earthquake, almost doubled the resident population in the parish. As a consequence, the locality assumed a position of suburban bedroom community to Angra, with the majority of its population employed in the construction sector. Today, the economy of Terra Ch√£ is dominated by salary jobs in the urban area of Angra, causing the disappearance of the last vestiges of rural life that persisted.

While his date of birth cannot be confirmed, there is some mention of a Cecco Pierri working with the painter Paolo di Lazzarino in 1350. If this was a reference to di Pietro, then his date of birth can be placed around 1330.‚ÄúCecco Di Pietro in Dizionario Biografico ‚Äì Treccani‚Äù, n.d. http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/cecco-di- pietro_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ He was active starting from around 1370 and died sometime before 1402. Cecco is seen as an important figure in Trecento art because of his development of a style that incorporated elements of Pisan painting along with those of the Sienese School.  Life and work  Early documents indicate that some of Cecco di Pietro's first work as an artist was restoring frescoes. He is first mentioned in notices from around 1370 as having worked at the Campo Santo with five other painters working on restoring frescoes in the area. He is next mentioned in notices from 1372 concerning the restoration of the Story of Job fresco in the Campo Santo with Francesco Volterra.van Marle, R., and C. van Marle. The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting. The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting. M. Nijhoff, n.d. https://books.google.com/books?id=nMExAAAAMAAJ. Records regarding his pay from the time show that it was a small sum of money when compared with other artists of the day, indicating that he was still inexperienced and learning the craft of the Pisan school from Volterra. Following the restoration of the Story of Job, there is another notice of Cecco di Pietro being hired in 1379 to restore the Inferno from a trio of frescoes by Buonamico Buffalmacco which were also located in the Campo Santo and were apparently damaged by some untrained apprentices in a previous restoration attempt. Of the restoration of the Inferno, most scholars only attribute the 2nd circle of Hell and two figures to the side of the Devil as the portions restored by Cecco, with the other restoration work carried out by a separate unknown artist. Cecco continued to receive a number of local commissions painting many altarpieces. One such altarpiece is the Polyptych of Agnano, executed between 1386‚Äì1395 for the church and convent at Agnano, and is considered one of Cecco's most important pieces. He continued to work in the fresco style until his death around 1402Multiple Sources from Crowe and Shapley as well as Galerie G.Sarti ‚ÄúCecco Di Pietro, Gallery Giovanni Sarti‚Äù, n.d. http://www.sarti- gallery.com/site/paintings/artists/ceccodipietro/index.html?viewartist=59.  Style  Polittico di Agnano, Palazzo Blu, Pisa During his career Cecco worked in themes common to other artists of the Trecento period. Much of the artwork produced by Cecco was of the Virgin and Child such as The Virgin and Child With Donors in 1386, which was part of a polyptych that has since been separated and its various pieces are located in different museums around the world. In documents from 1380 we see that Cecco was referred to as anziano or ‚Äúelder‚Äù in Italian. This classifies him as a representative of the ‚ÄúSan Simoncino di Porta‚Äù parish that he belonged to in Pisa. Initial evaluations by early art historians looked on Cecco di Pietro's work as not being historically or technically significant.Sir√©n, Osvald. ‚ÄúTrecento Pictures in American Collections-V.‚Äù The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 15, no. 75 (June 1, 1909): 197‚Äì196. Additionally, some early art historians did not critically consider the Pisan School as a whole.Crowe, Joseph Archer. A History of Painting in Italy Umbria, Florence and Siena, from the 2nd to the 16th Century. London England: J. Murray, 1908. Later Cecco's work has been reevaluated, and is now seen as one of the Pisan masters with his own unique style. His style evolved over his career, starting first as an example of the Pisan School of painting and eventually developing into a hybrid of Sienese and Pisan styles. Cecco's greatest influence from the Pisan school was in his use of punches, a decoration trend where the artist would punch shapes and patterns out of metal to be incorporated in the painting that was very popular in Tuscany during the Trecento.Frinta, Mojm√≠r S. ‚ÄúAn Investigation of the Punched Decoration of Mediaeval Italian and Non-Italian Panel Paintings‚Äù The Art Bulletin Vol. 47, No. 2 (Jun., 1965), pp. 261-265 https://www.jstor.org/stable/3048260Frinta, Mojm√≠r S. ‚ÄúA Seemingly Florentine Yet Not Really Florentine Altar-Piece.‚Äù The Burlington Magazine 117, no. 869 (1975): 527‚Äì535. His earlier work such as The Madonna and Child with Donors is more naturalistic when compared with his later works, where his figures take on a more elongated and ethereal appearance similar to the Sienese style at the time. This is seen most prominently in the depiction of the head of the child.Crowe, Joseph Archer. A History of Painting in Italy: Umbria, Florence and Siena, from the 2nd to the 16th Century. London, England: J. Murray, 1908. p. 164 Another work that clearly displays this shift towards more ethereal figures is the recently restored Virgin and Child Playing with a Gold Finch.. In this painting the Madonna's face and neck have taken on a longer more drawn appearance, and the fingers of the Madonna are long and slender. It is unknown what exactly brought about this shift in Cecco's style but there is some work that suggests that Sienese painter Luca di Tomm√® may have been an influence. Whether through direct mentorship or Cecco's admiration of his work, there are many similarities between works of Tomm√® and later works of Cecco. These similarities can be seen between Cecco's Polpytch of the Crucifixion from 1386 and a similar scene by di Tomme from 1366. Cecco created many works in this hybrid style which presents an example into the shifting styles of painters at the start of the Italian Renaissance.

Critics agree that in this, Tyler's 18th novel, the author again treads familiar territory by setting her novel in Baltimore and by following the life of an inconspicuous man who has never realised his full potential. Plot summary On the surface, Liam Pennywell leads an ordered, decent life. Once widowed and once divorced, with three grown-up daughters, he has just been dismissed from his teaching job and, for lack of funds, has moved to a smaller apartment on the outskirts of Baltimore. Toying with the idea of retiring altogether rather than going job hunting at his age, Pennywell is assaulted by a burglar on the very first night he stays at his new place. When he wakes up in hospital with a bandaged head, he cannot remember a thing about the attack. The loss of memory disturbs him more than the crime itself. In a neurologist's waiting room he observes 38-year-old Eunice accompanying an ageing entrepreneur to his doctor's appointment and finds out that she is working for him as a \\"rememberer\\" or, as she herself puts it later, the old man's \\"external hard drive.\\" Intrigued by this occupation, Pennywell contrives a chance encounter with her, and eventually they strike up a relationship with each other. Complications in their love affair arise when his youngest daughter, 17-year- old Kitty, decides to move in with him, obviously because she expects to be enjoying more freedom than if she stayed with her mother; and when his middle daughter Louise makes a habit of dumping his four-year-old grandson Jonah at Pennywell's apartment for him to babysit. On top of that, Eunice turns out to be a married woman who, after Pennywell has found out, still does not want to let go of him. In the end the police arrest the burglar‚Äîa juvenile delinquent whose mother has the cheek to ask Pennywell to serve as a character witness at her son's forthcoming trial. By then, Pennywell has made up with his eldest daughter Xanthe, who was bearing an old grudge against her father, has got rid of Eunice, and has got settled in at his new apartment. Also, he has started working as a zayde for Jewish preschool children. Title The novel takes its title from a discussion Pennywell has with his grandson about whether Noah was steering his ark, or just bobbing up and down in the flood. \\"Noah didn't need to figure out directions, because the whole world was underwater and so it made no difference,\\" he tells Jonah. ‚ÄúThere wasn't anywhere to go. He was just trying to stay afloat.\\" Reviews * William Boot: \\"Do I Have to Read Noah's Compass?\\", www.thedailybeast.com (23 January 2010). * Kathleen Byrne: \\"Families, They Suck You Up\\", The Globe and Mail (29 January 2010). * Elizabeth Day: \\"Anne Tyler's Noah's Compass, The Observer (16 August 2009). * Kathryn Harrison: \\"The Memory Thief\\", The New York Times (3 January 2010) BR10. * Yvonne Zipp: \\"Noah's Compass\\", The Christian Science Monitor (5 January 2010). * Links to more reviews at www.reviewsofbooks.com.

Lewis (c. 1974) is an American actor and comedian best known for portraying Junior Bevil in the 1993 comedy film Cool Runnings.Interview with Cool Runnings Star Rawle D. Lewis AKA Junior Bevil on YouTubeScriptcat's tips, tricks & tactics Vol. 12 \\"Attracting talent.\\" Guest Rawle D. Lewis (Cool Runnings) on YouTubeCool Runnings at The New York Times Early and personal life It was originally presumed that Lewis was born in Jamaica. However, Lewis later revealed in an interview for the 229th issue of Empire, \\"So I had lied on my resume. I was born in Trinidad, so I said I had done all this acting in Trinidad, 'cos I figured, who the hell's going to figure that out?\\" Despite this, Lewis stated on that same interview that he was from the Caribbean. Lewis confirmed in another interview that part of his family is of Jamaican descent. According to Reap Mediazine, Lewis is originally from New Jersey. Lewis moved to Los Angeles in high school and did his first stand-up set at the age of seventeen. He described himself as being a ‚Äúpretty shy guy in high school\\". A friend of his suggested he try stand-up comedy. Lewis almost considered quitting stand-up due to being embarrassed by his debut performance, in which heckling occurred. However, fellow comedian D.L. Hughley encouraged him not to quit. Lewis resides in Los Angeles. Today, Lewis travels all over the world for about three months of the year performing stand-up. Of the countries he has traveled into include Senegal, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, and Guatemala. He has even visited Jamaica. Cool Runnings At first, Lewis was not supposed to have auditioned as the producers originally wanted A-list stars to have portrayed the four leads. According to Lewis, \\"I came in to this film at first to coach the players in the authentic accents, but then I was asked to do a screen test -- so here I am.\\" He later said in another interview, \\" I was helping them cast the movie.\\" At the time, Lewis had been participating in play which was viewed by a casting director for Cool Runnings. Liking his performance, the casting director later called Lewis and said, \\"Hey, we're working on this movie about the Jamaican bobsled team and we want to make sure these guys have a good Jamaican accent. Can you do a good Jamaican accent?\\" Lewis agreed to audition and on November 1992, he won what became his most recognized role, Junior Bevil. Lewis claims he gets recognized for the film at least three or four times a week. The same applies in his recognition outside of the United States: \\"For some reason, English people recognise me a lot more than people from other European countries. And probably it's primarily because it's in the English language. But also, in France, the movie's called Rasta Rockett, and so that's what I get on the street. Especially a lot of people from Senegal, they yell out at me, 'Rasta Rockett!' That is bizarre, I never expect that.\\" His performance in the film was recognized by Hartford Courant film critic Malcolm Johnson, who wrote in his review that Lewis had \\"bright but cringing eagerness.\\" Despite his stardom with the film, Lewis once told Entertainment Weekly, \\"Sometimes I forget I‚Äôm in it.\\" Later career In 1996, Lewis appeared in the parody comedy film, Spy Hard. He mentioned in the Empire interview how Leslie Nielsen \\"was already like 70, at least, and he was still so funny,\\" during the making the film. Lewis found Nielsen \\"brilliant\\" to work with. Lewis appeared in the film Driven, which was also released that same year.Rawle D. Lewis filmography at The New York Times He also played a security guard in the 2001 film, K-PAX.Hollywood.comK-PAX cast at The New York Times Lewis attempted to write, produce and direct a film titled Bulletheads.

He worked as a guide for Vladimir Arsenyev who immortalized him in his 1923 book Dersu Uzala. The book was adapted into two feature films, with the version by Akira Kurosawa being the better known.  Life  The Russian explorer Arsenyev started his expeditions to the forests of the Far East in the area of Ussuri in 1902. He described numerous species of Siberian flora and the lifestyle of native ethnic people. When Arsenyev met the trapper Uzala he hired him as a guide for his journeys.David Prynn and G. H. Harper: Amur Tiger. G H Harper, 2004, , page 11 Uzala earned the respect of Arsenyev and his team. When Uzala's eyesight and other senses began to fade with age, Arsenyev offered to take him to the city where he lived. Uzala discovered that he was not permitted to chop wood or to build a hut and fireplace in the city park, nor was he allowed to shoot within the city limits. In the spring of 1908 he asked Arsenyev for permission to return to the woods. As a parting gift, Arseniev gave him a new rifle. Shortly afterward, Dersu Uzala was murdered. It was speculated that his murderer wanted his new rifle.  Cultural references  Memorial stone for Uzala in Korfovsky Monument for Uzala in Arseniev In 1923 Arseniev released his book Dersu Usala, which later was released under the alternate U.S. titles With Dersu the Hunter and Dersu the Trapper.

The second film was filmed in 1975 by Akira Kurosawa. Uzala was played by Maxim Munzuk. The film won the Golden Prize and the Prix FIPRESCI at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival and the 1976 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.

Structure of The Encyclopedia The author has observed certain methodical principles in structuring this Encyclopedia which he believes must be adhered to for any desired achievement connected to any work. Below are a few of the things which he followed in producing The Hussaini Encyclopedia: \\\\- In view of facilitation, classification and good order, every section is divided into main chapters, and each chapter is divided into subsections. All materials are headed, numbered and marked which could assist the task of the reader, researcher and critic. For avoiding ambiguity, all texts are marked by phonetic signs when necessary. \\\\- In The Hussaini Encyclopedia each volume is followed by some selected verses from the Quran which give praise to Allah, his Messenger (Mohammed), and his family (Ahlul Bayt). Each volume is also followed by Hadiths narrated from both sects of Islam which relate to the Cause of Imam Al-Hussain. \\\\- Every important chapter or section is coupled with a three-line rhyme-prose supplication that consists of praising The Creator, praying for the Seal of prophets and saying Peace be Upon Him and on his noble family. These lines amount to about a hundred different supplications on a single subject. \\\\- Each chapter or section has an introduction, and each chapter or section ends up with a conclusion where a summary of topics is states. Each volume ends with a concise summary of topics from that volume. These informative conclusions have been worked by scholarly personalities of different ethnic, religious and sectarian identities. \\\\- The information in the Encyclopedia is of reviewed work and comes free of prejudice. It's not set from an assumption and then supporting evidence searched for. \\\\- Anything of uncertainty has been explained in the margins where plenty of space is left for text and commentaries.http://en.hcht.org/?part=menu&inc;=menu&id;=50 List of Printed Volumes Volumes published so far by the Hussaini Encyclopedia Volume of The Hussaini Encyclopedia :1.

According to Diodorus Siculus,Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 5.62.3‚Äì4 she and Parthenos were put in charge of watching after their father's wine but fell asleep while performing this duty, and while they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swine their family kept. When the sisters woke up, they saw what had happened and, in fear of their father's wrath, threw themselves off a cliff. Apollo, who was in love with Rhoeo, would not let her sisters die and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus, where both received divine honors; Molpadia's name was changed to Hemithea upon her deification. PartheniusParthenius, Erotica Pathemata 1 makes Hemithea mother of Basileus by Lyrcus; in his version of the story, Hemithea apparently had this name since birth and nothing is said of her deification; however, Staphylus and his daughters' home is located in Bubastus, right where Hemithea came to be worshipped in Diodorus' account. * Hemithea, also known as AmphitheaStephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v.
