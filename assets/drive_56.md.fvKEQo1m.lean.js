He conducted early electrical treatment of patients at King's College Hospital and he was mainly instrumental in creating the Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases. Biography Born in Lippe-Detmold, Germany, on 31 March 1833, Althaus was the fourth and youngest son of Friedrich Althaus and Julie Draescke. His father was general superintendent of Lippe-Detmold, a Protestant dignity equal to the Anglican rural dean; his mother was a daughter of the last Protestant bishop of Magdeburg. He received his classical education at the University of Bonn, and began his medical studies at G√∂ttingen in 1851 continuing in Heidelberg and graduated M.D. at Berlin in 1855, with a thesis de Pneumothorace. He then visited Sicily with Professor Johannes Peter M√ºller to study zoology.D'A. Power, \\"Althaus, Julius (1833‚Äì1900)\\", rev. Caroline Overy, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 accessed 16 Feb 2013 He worked under Professor Jean Martin Charcot in Paris. National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic Althaus moved to London, where as an assistant to Robert Bentley Todd he carried out the treatment of patients at King's College Hospital using electricity. In 1866, he was largely responsible for creating the Hospital for Epilepsy and Paralysis. This facility in Regent's Park later became the Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases and it is now part of National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. In 1877, Althaus unsuccessfully tried to rename the disease multiple sclerosis \\"Charcot's disease\\" after the disease's first descriptor, Jean-Martin Charcot. He gave two lectures on spinal cord sclerosis in 1884 and noted that the meaning of the term \\"sclerosis\\" varied from country to country. Althaus was the physician at the Hospital for Epilepsy and Paralysis until 1894, when he was appointed to the honorary office of consulting physician. Althaus married Anna Wilhelmina Pelzer in June 1859, and had two sons and a daughter, of whom the latter survived him. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1860. At the time of his death he was a corresponding fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine, and he was awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy. He died in London on 11 June 1900 as the result of damaging his knee in Switzerland on holiday the year before which was complicated by gout, followed by gastroenteritis and peritonitis. Althaus and his wife were the centre of a social circle and they were both musically talented. Althaus has been called a cultural polymath and he was a talented linguist which allowed him to understand the latest developments in neurology on an international basis. He was greatly interested in the therapeutic effects of electricity. Works Following Althaus' death, an obituarist described him as \\"a voluminous writer, and published many books and papers on various aspects of nervous disease.\\" A modern biography called this an understatement, acknowledging his works in the wider field of medicine throughout his lifetime. Some of his works include: * A treatise on medical electricity, theoretical and practical, and its use in the treatment of paralysis, neuralgia, and other diseases, 1859. * The spas of Europe, 1862. * On paralysis, neuralgia, and other affections of the nervous system: and their successful treatment by galvanisation and faradisation, 1864. * On epilepsy, hysteria and ataxy; three lectures, 1866. * Diseases of the nervous system, their prevalence and pathology, 1877. * On infantile paralysis and some allied diseases of the spinal cord: their diagnosis and treatment, 1878. * Functions of the brain; a popular essay, 1880. * On failure of brain power: its nature and treatment, 1882 (5 editions). * On sclerosis of the spinal cord: including locomotor ataxy, spastic spinal paralysis, and other system-diseases of the spinal cord: their pathology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, 1885, translated into German, Leipzig, 1884, and into French by J. Morin, with a preface by Prof. Charcot, Paris, 1885. * Influenza: its pathology, symptoms, complications, and sequels; its origin and mode of spreading; and its diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, 1892.

Harrison was part of the England team that won the Grand Slam during the 1914 Five Nations Championship. Personal history Harrison was born in Solihull, England in 1889 to Edward James and Laura Harrison and was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham. He was married to Katie Deeley of Box, Wiltshire. He died at home at Ivor Court in Marylebone in London in 1940 at the age of 51. He was buried at East Finchley Cemetery.CWGC casualty record Rugby career Harrison came to note as a rugby player when he represented the Royal Marine Artillery team based in Woolwich. An imposing forward player, he was selected for both the Army and Royal Navy teams before representing the United Services. The United Services was made up of servicemen from the Royal Navy and played against the biggest clubs from all over Great Britain. It was while Harrison was playing for United Services that he was selected to play at international level, gaining his first cap for England in the 1909 Home Nations Championship. Harrison was the only new cap brought into the England squad, to face Scotland at Richmond. England lost 8‚Äì18, and Harrison was dropped for the rest of the campaign. The 1914 England team vs Scotland. Harrsion is sat third from left Although out of favour at international level, Harrison was still in demand. In 1911 he was selected to play for invitational touring team the Barbarians, joining the side on their Easter tour of Wales. He was re-invited to join the Barbarians in 1914, to play a forces team from Shoreham Camp. Harrison was given the honour of captaining the Barbarians to 16‚Äì13 victory, his opposing captain being Edgar Mobbs. 1914 also saw Harrison back in favour with the England selectors, and in February he was back in the national team to face Ireland as part of the 1914 Five Nations Championship. England had won the opening game of the tournament against Wales, and Harrison retained his place when they narrowly beat Ireland at Twickenham. He then faced Scotland for the second time, this time away from home at Inverleith. Harrison was given conversion duties during the match, an unusual tactic for a forward, and successfully kicked two goals which prove decisive in a narrow 16‚Äì15 win for his England team. With three victories over the other Home Nations, England had won the Triple Crown, leaving recent inductees France as the only obstacle to stop England taking the Championship and the Grand Slam. Harrison was again selected, but kicking duties were now given to John Greenwood. England won convincingly, making Harrison a Grand Slam winning champion. He may have been selected for further England games, but the outbreak of the First World War ended all international competitions. Harrison continued to play rugby during the war, and again captained the Barbarians in a 1915 encounter with a South African Services XI. In 1922, he took part as a referee in the international encounter between France and Scotland in the 1922 Five Nations Championship. Whilst playing in the Navy, Harrison was known by the nickname, \\"Dreadnought\\". Military service Harison was a career soldier and joined the British armed forces after leaving school. He served in the Royal Marines Artillery and by 1908 he had reached the rank of lieutenant. During the First World War he was initially stationed in German South-West Africa, where he served as a commander of a South African siege battery. He was first Mentioned in Despatches during the African campaign and by 1915 he had been promoted to temporary major. In 1916 he and his battery were stationed in France, and during action in Pozi√®res he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His DSO citation reads: On 29 July 1916 he was caught in a gas attack and declared unfit to return to the Front. He returned to Britain, where he served as a gunnery instructor at Lydd from 1917 to 1918. He returned to active duty in October 1918, and served in the Heavy Artillery division of the XI Corps at the Western Front. After the First World War, Harrison remained with the British military, becoming adjutant of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich from 1919 until 1921. He transferred from the Royal Marines to the British Army's East Yorkshire Regiment in 1924 and was brevetted lieutenant colonel in 1927. He then spent some years serving in different posts in Asia. He served in Singapore from March 1923 until April 1924, where he was General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) before being posted to British Malaya until 1925 as GSO 2. Between 1925 and 1928 he served as a GSO2 in the War Office. He was posted to India in 1930, becoming an instructor at the Staff College, Quetta, achieving the full rank of lieutenant colonel in 1932. That same year he was given a role in the Imperial Defence College and from 1932 until 1935 he commanded the 1st Battalion of the Green Howards.

Bessent had a reputation for the strength of his convictions, holding onto his investment theses even when they differed from those of George Soros. In August 2015, it was announced that Bessent would be leaving Soros Fund Management to start his new firm, Key Square Group, with $2 billion of George Soros's money.

Bessent founded Key Square Group with Michael Germino, who had been the Global Head of Capital Markets at SFM. A number of the pair's former colleagues from SFM followed them to Key Square. Key Square received a $2 billion anchor investment from George Soros. By the end of its first quarter of operation, Key Square was managing $4.5 billion from a close-knit group of trusted investors. The firm was oversubscribed at launch, and had to turn away some capital. At the end of 2017, Key Square's assets were $5.1 billion. Bloomberg in May 2018 reported that Key Square had mostly outperformed rival macro managers and continued to generate significant investor interest. As part of a pre-arranged deal, the firm gradually returned the Soros capital as it took in other assets. Its investors include Australia's sovereign wealth fund.

Introduced in 2013, it is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS). From 1958 to 2010 a train of the same name linked Basel or Z√ºrich with Vienna (see history below). The name of the train alludes to the fact that it crosses the Alps. Transalpin was also the Ancient Roman word meaning \\"behind the Alps\\", and referring to the region of that name in northern Switzerland. Route The train takes 9 h 34 min from Z√ºrich to Graz (9 h 35 min in the other direction) and stops at Sargans, Buchs SG, Feldkirch, Bludenz, Langen am Arlberg, St. Anton am Arlberg, Landeck-Zams, Imst-Pitztal, √ñtztal, Innsbruck, Jenbach, W√∂rgl, Kirchberg in Tirol, Kitzb√ºhel, St. Johann in Tirol, Saalfelden, Zell am See, Schwarzach-St. Veit, St. Johann im Pongau, Bischofshofen, Radstadt, Schladming, Stainach-Irdning, Liezen, Selzthal, St. Michael in Obersteiermark, and Leoben. In Buchs SG (border checkpoint) and Selzthal the train changes its direction of travel. Train formation In the timetable period 2014/2015 the EC Transalpin is composed of one first class open panorama coach of the SBB CFF FFS, the other coaches are of the √ñBB, including a dining car and a combine baggage car with first class seats, allowing to transport bicycles. In second class, both compartment coaches and open coaches are offered.Train composition EC 163 and EC 164 on vagonweb.cz Between Z√ºrich and Buchs, the train is usually pulled by a locomotive of SBB CFF FFS class Re 420. Between Buchs and Graz, a locomotive of √ñBB class 1016 or 1116 is used, with another locomotive of the same class added in front between Buchs and Innsbruck. History Class 4010 with the Transalpin at Basel SBB, 1970.|alt=A Class 4010 with the Transalpin at Basel SBB, 1970. The Transalpin was first introduced in 1958, it was operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS). For most of its life, it ran between Wien Westbf in Vienna, Austria, and Basel SBB in Switzerland. In 1987, it was designated a EuroCity train.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (May 31 - June 30, 1987 edition), pp. 472, 475. UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. In 2008, it was cut back from Basel SBB to Z√ºrich HB, Switzerland. It was discontinued in June 2010, and replaced by a Railjet service.Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable (May 2010 edition), pp. 89, 583. UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. From 1 June 1958 until 13 June 2010, the Transalpin was a showpiece of the √ñBB and the SBB. Introduced the year after the Trans Europ Express (TEE) network was set up in 1957, it had both first- and second-class accommodation, and therefore did not meet the \\"first class only\\" requirements to be a TEE. Throughout its history, the Transalpin ran daily in both directions. Until the 2000s, it was always one of the fastest railway connections, with the fewest intermediate stops, in its area of operation. The initial train numbers of the Transalpin were TS 11/12, and its original route was Wien Westbf to Z√ºrich HB. In 1959, the route was extended to Basel (SBB station). When it became a EuroCity train, in 1987, its train numbers became EC 62 westbound and EC 63 eastbound. To save time and the need for the train to reverse direction during its journey, the Transalpin did not stop at Salzburg Hauptbahnhof initially, but ran via the curve from Elixhausen to Salzburg-Gnigl, and stopped at Salzburg Aigen. Even today, this curve, which is now used mainly by goods trains, is known by the name Transalpin- Schleife (Transalpin curve). In 1969, the route was changed. From then onwards, the Transalpin ran from the Western Railway at Salzburg Hbf to W√∂rgl via the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB)‚Äìowned Rosenheim‚ÄìSalzburg and Rosenheim‚ÄìKufstein railways, instead of along the previous route via Bischofshofen and Zell am See (Gisela railway).Bufe (2009), p 44.\\"Stop Press\\" (changes taking effect). Cook's Continental Timetable (June 1969 edition), p. 107; also pp. 322, 326‚Äì327. Thomas Cook Publishing. As the Transalpin had no scheduled stops in Germany, it was operated there as a so-called Korridorzug or \\"privilege train\\", a train in which (in the period before the Schengen Agreement) the passport and customs checks that would otherwise be required were not applicable. Until the construction of the \\"\\" in 1982, the train had been reversed at Rosenheim. In 1975, a writer for Fodor's travel guides described the Transalpin as \\"one of the best trains in Europe for mountain scenery\\". In 1980, a trip on the Transalpin from Z√ºrich to Vienna was featured in \\"Changing Trains\\", the final episode in Series 1 of Great Railway Journeys of the World, a BBC TV travel documentary. The \\"Changing Trains\\" trip, which formed part of a longer journey from Paris to Budapest, was also described in the book published to complement the TV series. In the book, Eric Robson, the presenter and author of \\"Changing Trains\\", commented that the Transalpin, as of 1980, was simply the best train that the √ñBB had to offer, \\"... the star of this single main line to the east.\\"Robson (1981), p. 180 When the EuroCity network was launched on 31 May 1987, the Transalpin was among the previously existing international express trains to be redesignated as EuroCity trains. In June 2010, the Transalpin was replaced by the \\"Railjet 162\\" and \\"Railjet 163\\", which run to approximately the same timetable.Mauerer (2009), p 628. In the timetable period 2013/2014, five pairs of Railjets connect Z√ºrich and Vienna. =Route (historic)= In 2009/2010 the route of the Transalpin was as follows: *Wien Westbf ‚Äì Wien H√ºtteldorf (√ñBB EC 163 only) ‚Äì St. P√∂lten Hbf ‚Äì Linz Hbf ‚Äì Salzburg Hbf ‚Äì Innsbruck Hbf ‚Äì Landeck-Zams ‚Äì Bludenz ‚Äì Feldkirch ‚Äì Buchs ‚Äì Sargans ‚Äì Z√ºrich HB The train reversed its direction at Buchs SG. In the westbound EC 162, the first-class cars were marshalled at the front of the train from Buchs to Zurich, and in the eastbound √ñBB-EC 163, they were at the front of the train from Buchs to Vienna. This arrangement meant that at the two termini, both of which were terminal stations, the first-class cars were always closer to the station concourse. At times when there were interruptions on the Arlberg line due to railway construction work, or as a consequence of natural disasters ‚Äì such as avalanches and debris flows, or between August and December 2005 after storm damage ‚Äì the Transalpin was substantially diverted between Salzburg and Bregenz via M√ºnchen Hbf and the Bavarian Allg√§u railway. =Train formation (historic)= Initially, the Transalpin was operated by a four-member fleet of four-car electric multiple units, which had been procured specifically for the purpose. The Class 4130 was a development of the Class 4030, but had a higher capacity and top speed, and its control car was equipped with a kitchen. In 1965, the √ñBB replaced the Transalpin's Class 4130s with three six-car multiple units, which, again, had been procured specifically for the purpose. alt=Interior of an SBB-CFF-FFS panorama car. In May 1977, the Class 4010s were replaced with a locomotive-hauled train formation (consist).Thomas Cook International Timetable (May 22‚ÄìJune 30, 1977 edition), p. 515. UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. On the first day of the new arrangement, 21 May, the Transalpin consisted of an √ñBB Class 1042 electric locomotive, five √ñBB Schlieren coaches, one DB WR√ºmh restaurant car (ex- Rheingold) and six additional √ñBB Schlieren coaches. From the following day, 22 May 1977, the train, now operating as Ex 462/463, was made up of 12 √ñBB Z1 (Eurofima) coaches, one WR√ºmh and three DB RIC coaches. On the ascending grades of the Arlberg railway, the eastbound locomotive-hauled train often received assistance from a pilot or banking locomotive. In the 1990s, an SBB- CFF-FFS first-class panorama car was added to the train. In some of the annual schedules, the train received an additional SBB Am or Apm first class coach and the restaurant was an internationally equipped SBB WRm of the EWIV family.

It had offices in 8 cities, namely New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Pune. In 2013, the firm had nearly 600 lawyers including 85 partners. The firm split into two different law firms in May 2015 - Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas. Founding AMSS was started in 1917 by Amarchand Shroff, the grandfather of Shardul S. Shroff and Cyril Shroff, who are the present Managing Partners. They took charge in 1994 after the death of their father, Suresh. Although Shardul was 39 and Cyril 35, they were easily accepted as the firm's future. They had been part of the practice for around a decade and it was a small operation of 25-30 lawyers. The firm serves some of the largest corporations and financial institutions domestically and internationally, including clients such as Vedanta Resources, Reliance Industries, GMR Group and Morgan Stanley. It has received national and international acclaim for successful representation of its clients before legal institutions and government agencies, winning advocacy in litigation, and guiding business transactions. In addition, members of the firm regularly participate in several legal reforms committees and policy initiatives of the Government of India. The firm‚Äôs clientele includes several leading Indian and international business houses, transnational corporations and financial institutions. Partnership Structure Most of the firm‚Äôs equity was held by the Shroff family‚ÄîCyril, Shardul and their respective wives, Vandana and Pallavi, who are also practising senior partners in the firm, and family matriarch Bharati Shroff. The rest of the profits are shared with 18 non- family equity partners in a modified lockstep model. Partners on the seven- stage ladder accrue points over time, subject to satisfying the requirements to pass two ‚Äúgateways‚Äù at three years and five years. We trained our lawyers on financial statements and basics of accounting, we cross staffed across teams (such as real estate, M&A;, private equity etc.). These steps helped us to be first off the blocks,‚Äù Cyril Shroff on the business development and associate management fronts. Change of Reign In 1980 elder son of Suresh Shroff, Shardul Shroff took over the charge of the Delhi office. Suresh Shroff died in 1994. Cyril Shroff, younger son of Suresh Shroff, took over the Mumbai office in 1995. Following the death of the matriarch Bharati Shroff, the Shroff brothers had a public fallout due to ownership disputes. Their mother had willed her entire partnership interest to Shardul Shroff, contrary to the family framework agreement. Following directions of the Bombay High Court and several rounds of mediation, the firm was split between the two brothers. The firm run by Cyril Shroff came into existence on 11 May 2015 and was named as Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.

Their role is particularly important in the research setting, especially when the authors are not native English speakers but are required to publish in English for international communication. The work of language professionals falls within the language industry.  Activities  The writing support provided by language professionals may involve teaching specific writing skills, translating documents into the desired publishing language, editing drafts at various stages of completion, guiding the creation of a new document, and--in some cases--writing for authors. Thus, the services offered by language professionals include language teaching (especially the teaching of academic writing), translation, author editing, developmental editing, and writing (medical writing and technical writing). These activities differ in functional terms but share a common goal, namely helping authors produce quality papers for publication.  Business characteristics  Language professionals may be self-employed (freelance or small entrepreneurs) or employed at universities, research institutes and companies that generate scientific-technical documentation. They may also work indirectly through a translation or editing agency (although the presence of an intermediary may hinder the development of a direct, professional relationship with the author- client). Their services are provided in classroom, distance or one-on-one settings. They may offer only one type of service or combine several services to best serve a particular author group; often they specialize in a subject area in which they have prior training or work experience. By adopting the label language professional, those who offer writing support services emphasize that they are dedicated to running a service business (or, if employed, they adopt an entrepreneurial spirit) and that their conduct is guided by professional values and ethics. As professionals, they work with confidence and use specialized knowledge and skills to find tailored solutions for each client's request. Language professionals have also been called professional language consultants, as outlined by Mediterranean Editors and Translators: \\"Professional language consultants distinguish themselves by the quality of their product, by a strong sense of business ethics, and [by] a high level of professional organization.\\" Another term sometimes used is language service provider, while the related, but broader literacy broker includes \\"editors, reviewers, academic peers, and English-speaking friends and colleagues, who mediate text production in a number of ways\\".  Ethical working practices  The language professional facilitates the writing process without interfering with the authors' ownership of and responsibility for the published document. He or she does not substitute the authors' role in conceiving the document and producing the content: she is not a ghost writer. She is familiar with issues of publication ethics and adheres to publishing guidelines, especially those of the Committee on Publication Ethics and, in the medical field at least, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. In particular, the work of the language professional does not cross the boundary into authorship. Rather, it is becoming increasingly common (especially in the biomedical sciences) for the language professional's contribution to a paper to be recognized in the paper's acknowledgements section. Continuing professional development Given that language professionals are called on to solve problems that cannot be standardized, they engage in educational activities to keep up with new developments in, for example, publishing standards, tools and technology, didactic methods and ethics. Educational opportunities and materials, including conferences, training workshops and publications, are offered by the numerous membership associations open to linguists, editors, translators and writers. Examples of associations providing continuing professional development activities are EATAW, the Council of Science Editors, the European Medical Writers Association, the European Association of Science Editors, the Society for Editors and Proofreaders and Mediterranean Editors and Translators, the first association to specifically aim to bring together different types of language professionals.

It has since been applied to other antimicrobial peptides including LL-37. It utilizes a method of enumerating bacteria called quantitative growth kinetics, which compares the time taken for a bacterial batch culture to reach a threshold optical density with that of a series of calibration curves. The name VCC has also been used to describe the application of quantitative growth kinetics to enumerate bacteria in cell culture infection models. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) can be done on 96-well plates by diluting the antimicrobial agent at varying concentrations in broth inoculated with bacteria and measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration that results in no growth. However, these methods cannot be used to study some membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, which are inhibited by the broth itself. The virtual colony count procedure takes advantage of this fact by first exposing bacterial cells to the active antimicrobial agent in a low-salt buffer for two hours, then simultaneously inhibiting antimicrobial activity and inducing exponential growth by adding broth. The growth kinetics of surviving cells can then be monitored using a temperature-controlled plate reader. Quantitative growth kinetics VCC calibration curves The method of enumeration of surviving cells used by VCC is termed quantitative growth kinetics (QGK). It relates the kinetic time taken for the turbidity of a bacterial batch microbiological culture in a well of a 96-well microplate to reach a threshold difference in turbidity to a 10-fold dilution series of calibration growth curves. Quantification of the number of viable cells is done using a process mathematically identical to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), except with QGK cells, rather than copies of PCR products, grow exponentially. The time taken to reach the threshold is called the \\"threshold time\\", Tt, which is equivalent to the QPCR value \\"cycle time\\" or Ct. There are at least five processes that cause delays in threshold times in VCC assays: 1\\\\. Adhesion, causing cells to stick to the microplate and possibly form biofilms. Unless these cells happen to be directly in the light path, their growth will not affect optical density readings. 2\\\\. Cohesion, causing cells to aggregate into clumps of various sizes instead of a homogeneous suspension of individual cells undergoing binary fission. Cohesion can cause imprecision and fluctuations in Tt. Cohesive clumps may also be adhesive, leading to both imprecision due to cohesion and inaccuracy (increased Tt) due to adhesion. 3\\\\. Bacteriostatic activity, causing cells to become unable to enter exponential growth even though they are not killed. Transient bacteriostatic activity can cause lag times, increasing Tt. 4\\\\. The metabolic lag phase of bacterial growth. Such a lag phase would be expected to occur in the assay as cells growing slowly or not at all during the initial exposure to antimicrobial peptides in the low-salt buffer are shifted to exponential growth upon addition of twice-concentrated rich media. If this metabolic lag phase increases in the presence of the antimicrobial peptide, it could be considered a form of transient bacteriostatic activity in category 3, above, although other sources of transient bacteriostatic activity, such as a delay due to the time required for the repair of damaged cell structures such as cell walls or cell membranes, are possible. 5\\\\. Bactericidal activity, or killing. Fewer surviving cells cause a delay in Tt as the survivors take longer to produce the same amount of turbidity through exponential growth. If all other processes causing increases in Tt are negligible, the VCC assay becomes a bactericidal assay and Tt can be used to enumerate viable bacteria by QGK. In this simplified case, VCC \\"virtual survival\\" results are equivalent to the \\"survival\\" results of a traditional colony count bactericidal assay. Bacteria VCC was initially employed to quantify the antibacterial activity of peptides against six strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Commonly, a standard Gram- negative and Gram-positive quality control strain are compared. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 have been used as the standard Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, respectively. VCC has also been applied to Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Antimicrobial peptides The initial virtual colony count study measured the activity of all six human alpha defensins concurrently on the same 96-well plate: HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, HNP4, HD5, and HD6. Subsequently, mutated forms of some of those six defensins were studied by VCC. A conserved glycine in a beta bulge in HNP2 was replaced with a series of D-amino acids resulting in VCC activity proportional to side chain hydrophobicity and charge. VCC showed that N-terminally acetylated and/or C-terminally amidated HNP2 activity is proportional to electrostatic charge. VCC results were again proportional to charge for a series of salt bridge-disrupting mutants, suggesting that the salt bridge is not required for HNP2 function. VCC measured the importance of N-terminal natural and artificial pro segments of the propeptide HNP1, dramatically altering activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Enantiomer forms of HNP1, HNP4, HD5 and the beta defensin HBD2 composed entirely of D-amino acids suggested differing mechanisms of defensin activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. VCC results of dimerization-impaired monomer and tethered dimer forms of HNP1 demonstrated the importance of dimerization. Replacing the conserved glycine with L-alanine resulted in subtle VCC differences. Comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis of HNP1 and HD5 demonstrated the importance of bulky hydrophobic residues. These studies have recently been expanded to include additional beta defensins, theta defensins, and the human cathelicidin LL-37 and related peptides. Safe and effective pipetting technique VCC users are cautioned to transfer cells in a small volume such as 10 microliters beneath a larger volume such as 90 microliters, similar to the QGK calibration curves shown above and the calibration curves reported in the initial VCC publication, but unlike the experimental procedure used to test defensin activity in that same paper. The improved pipetting technique was described in 2011 in the study of the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) pathogen Bacillus anthracis. The original method published in 2005 involved the transfer of 50 microliters of cell suspensions to 50 microliters of liquid, which generates froth, bubbles and turbidity that is incompatible with a turbidimetric method when cells are transferred directly to the bottoms of the wells beneath the phosphate buffer solutions. Avoiding this problem by adding cell suspensions as droplets from above can cause aerosols that result in cross-contamination. Bioaerosols of hazardous bacteria can also pose safety risks that can be reduced by conducting experiments within a biosafety cabinet.

She won an Indonesian major literary prize, the Khatulistiwa Literary Award, in 2012 for her third novel, Maryam.Tale of Ahmadi Refugees Wins Literary Award The Jakarta Globe At the age of 28, she is the youngest ever to win this prestigious award. Her novels were shortlisted three years in a row by the award's judges. Okky has published 10 books since 2010, and is known for her exquisite portrayals of the social and political conditions in Indonesia, focusing her writing on resistance against injustice and the struggle for freedom and humanity in her five novels, one short story collection and a series of children's novels.. Her 10th book is a non-fiction titled Genealogi Sastra Indonesia: Kapitalisme, Islam dan Sastra Perlawanan (Genealogy of Indonesian Literature: Capitalism, Islam and Critical Literature), which tracks the origins of Indonesia's novels today. It was published online in December 2019 and can be freely downloaded from her website www.okkymadasari.net.https://okkymadasari.net/read/genealogi-sastra- indonesia-kapitalisme-islam-dan-sastra-perlawanan Okky's novels have been translated into English, German and Arabic. Her first novel Entrok, an epic about life under totalitarian and militarism during the Indonesia's New Order era, has been translated into English and was published in July 2013 under the title of The Years of the Voiceless. Her three subsequent novels, 86, Maryam and Pasung Jiwa, have also been translated into English under the title of 86, The Outcast and Bound respectively. Pasung Jiwa also has been translated in German under the title Gebunden in 2015. The novel has also been available in Arabic as it has been published in Egypt since 2019. Since 2018, Okky has begun writing children novels, and subsequently publishing three children novels of Mata Series, titled Mata di Tanah Melus (2018), Mata dan Rahasia Pulau Gapi (2018) and Mata dan Manusia Laut (2019). The final of the series called Mata di Dunia Purba is currently being written. Okky was born on October 30, 1984 in Magetan, East Java, Indonesia. She graduated from Gadjah Mada University‚Äôs International Relations Department in 2005 with bachelor's degree in Political Science. She has chosen to become a journalist and writer ever since her graduation. In 2012, she pursued a master's degree in sociology with the University of Indonesia, and graduated in July 2014 with a thesis titled Genealogi Novel Indonesia: Kapitalisme, Islam dan Sastra Perlawanan (Genealogy of Indonesian Novels: Capitalism, Islam and Critical Literature).. The thesis was published as book in December 2019 and can be freely downloaded and printed from Okky's official website www.okkymadasari.net. Starting August 2019 Okky has been working on her PhD thesis on cultural censorship in Indonesia's post totalitarian era with the National University of Singapore (NUS) under a full scholarship from the university. Novels Okky's novels consistently attempt to raise issues around human rights and freedom, describing struggles against any form of repression. Okky is a realist, with all of her novels attempting to portray the face of Indonesia. While she tells mostly about Indonesia and its people, the issues she carries in her novels showcase basic and universal humankind's problems. Her novels have won nationwide praises, with Apsanti Djokosujatno, one of Indonesia's prominent literary critic from the University of Indonesia, claiming that they are already categorized as canon and will become classic. She goes further to dub her as the next Pramoedya Ananta Toer.¬ª Entrok : Sebuah Novel Multifaset - okky madasari Okky's first novel, Entrok (2010), tells a story about how Indonesians live under the ruthless dictatorship of Suharto's regime and how they struggled to survive under oppression of the military's dominance.Unveiling sexuality and social insanity The Jakarta Post Her second novel 86 (2011) vividly describes the prevalent corruption within the country and especially among its civil servantsNovel documents one woman‚Äôs steep decline and rampant bribery The Jakarta Post The novel was shortlisted as top five in the Khatulistiwa Literary Award in 2011. Her third novel Maryam (2012) which describes how Ahmadis are violently thrown away from their own home and homeland with the government turning won the 2012 Khatulistiwa Literary Award. The novel has been translated into English under the title of The Outcast, and it's available in bookstores since March 2014. Pasung Jiwa is her fourth novel, released in May 2013. It addresses individual struggle to break free from his or her own individual limitation as well as the containment of norm, tradition, religion, state and economic dominance of the few rich. The novel was shortlisted by the Khatulistiwa Literary Award in 2013. Pasung Jiwa has also been translated into English under the title of Bound in July 2014 and translated into German under the title Gebunden. Five years later, it was translated into Arabic and published in Egypt. Her fifth novel, Kerumunan Terakhir, was published in May 2016. In this novel Okky tries to capture how digital phenomena and social media take over people's lives, with new generation confusing reality with virtual activities. The novel was then translated into English under the title of The Last Crowd. Short Story Collection In 2017 she published her first anthology of short stories titled Yang Bertahan dan Binasa Perlahan (Resisting and Fading Away), summing up various issues influential to Indonesia, and summarizing her short story writing within a decade. Short stories in the collection show consistency in Okky's interest and focus on human struggle to cop with limitation and conflicts, turning a real life daily events into exciting chronicles of life. This underrated collection also confirms Okky's unique story telling and range in mastery of issues, from very personal and private life of an individual to conflict in families to political corruption and religious hypocrisy in Indonesia. Children's Novels Inspired by her daughter's nightly before- sleep request for story telling, she embarked on writing novels for children in early 2018, and finished her first children's novel, Mata di Tanah Melus (Mata in the Land of Melus) in the middle of the same year. The novel tells a story about adventure of 12-year-old Matara and her mother in a fantasy world in Belu, East Nusa Tenggara. The novel becomes the first of children adventure series, called Mata Series, and has been well received either by the public and literary critics, with one analyst praising it as a progressive work important to Indonesia's children literature. Encouraged by the good reception, Okky quickly wrote the second of the series, titled Mata dan Rahasia Pulau Gapi (Mata and the Secret of Gapi Island), which is based on Okky's trip to Ternate Island. In this novel Matara and her new friends are trying to help save the great legacies of Ternate Island, with Okky mixing the crucial place of the island in the world history, including it as a center of global trade and describing it as the place where British great naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace once lived and corresponded with Charles Darwin, and the imaginary world and miracles on the island. Again, the novel has been greatly welcome. In early 2019 Okky published the third novel of the series titled Mata dan Manusia Laut (Mata and the Sea People) based on their trip to Wakatobi Island in Southeast Sulawesi. In this novel, Matara hangs out with her friends from Bajo (Bajau) community, who live on the sea in several places in Southeast Asia. This novel has also been warmly received. The fourth and the final book of the series, called Mata di Dunia Purba (Mata in the Old World) is currently being written. Each of the three books has become bases for various academic and thesis writing, with different aspects of the book being raised as important part for children., Non-Fiction Book In December 2019, based on her Master's thesis, Okky published her first non-fiction book titled Genealogi Sastra Indonesia: Kapitalisme, Islam dan Sastra Perlawanan (Genealogy Indonesian Literature: Capitalism, Islam and Critical Literature) in the form of digital book in her official website www.okkymadasari.net.https://twitter.com/okkymadasari/status/1201706544250834944 The book, Okky's 10th published book and can be freely downloaded and printed from the website, has been enthusiastically received by the public, causing the website to temporarily crash as so many people download it at the same time in the first day of its launch. Many people appreciate Okky's willingness to provide the book freely, praising it as rare move and greatly helping ordinary people to have access to literature works previously inaccessible. The book has received very positive review from critics, with one stating that it is a welcomed effort to seriously discuss again Indonesian literaturehttps://www.jawapos.com/minggu/buku/29/12/2019/menelusuri-arus- utama-sastra-indonesia/ while other claiming that the book is the first attempt since Ariel Heryanto, now a professor at Monash University in Australia, in 1985 with his book Perdebatan Sastra Konstektual (Debating Contextual Literature), which elaborates idea of Sastra Kontekstual from Arief Budiman, one of Indonesia's greatest thinkers, to really discuss Indonesian literature seriously and comprehensivelyhttps://alifya.id/2019/12/30/wacana/melacak-sastra-perlawanan/. Views and Opinions Okky has written a number of essays on various issues for Indonesian and international media and publication. While her novels and short stories have clearly reflected her interests and focus, her essays further confirm her position and commitment on issues like democracy, militarism, human rights, censorship, feminism, state abuse of power. elite domination, religious hypocrisy and protection of minority. In her essay for Griffith Review titled Islam, Capitalism and Literature in 2015, she describes penetration of Islamic fundamentalist teachings into fiction, especially novels, without nobody seemingly aware of it, criticizing publisher's ignorance in this regard and stating that the publishing companies pay no attention to the contents as these so-called Islamic novels do sell millions of copies.https://griffithreview.com/articles/islam-capitalism-and-literature/ She then warns the death of serious and critical literature and the wider and wider penetration of fundamentalist teachings among young Indonesians. She followed this essay by writing article on the same issue for Jakarta Post in subsequent year, titled Questioning Islamic Label of Books and Films, criticizing the misuse of Islam in the literary, art and cultural products for mere sales and stating instead that the books and films are not Islamic at all.https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2016/11/24/questioning-islamic-label- of-books-and-films.html Also on issue of fundamentalist penetration as wearing of hijab is becoming common across Indonesia, Okky criticizes it in her Jakarta Post's article in July 2018 as a force for uniformity, citing the fact that the authorities actually require students to wear hijab in school, and stating that those not wearing hijab are facing bullying and threats.https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/07/24/hijab-avoided- subject-on-childrens-day.html Okky also criticizes rising women's activism driven by strict and fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, stating that such a morally based activism is arbitrary, and is often against public interests.https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/12/22/political- mothers-at-their-best-and-worst.html Okky is also very active in fighting against blasphemy law in many of his writings, blasting it as legalizing and legitimizing hatred, violation against basic human rights and stupidity.https://www.jawapos.com/opini/06/11/2016/langit-makin-mendung/ She demands the law be changed or even eliminated altogether.https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/08/15/we-are-neither- kecebong-nor-kampret-now.html On Freedom of expression, censorship and omission in the Indonesian history, he argued the government to honest, open up and solve various past human rights abuses and killings, including 1965 massacre,https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/10/09/those-massive- lies-in-the-national-curriculum.html and abduction of activists around 1998 movement against Suharto, especially Wiji Thukul case.,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/01/31/wiji-thukul-a-film-alone- wont-be-enough.htmlhttps://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2016/08/11/wiji-thukul- from-solo-to-locarno.html She demanded the revision of the national curriculum to include what was actually happened during the 19965-1966, and arguing Indonesian authorities to officially acknowledge and admitted the massacre, and apologize to the victims. On issues of the region, she believes that rather than politics and economic, a true and genuine bond of people in Southeast Asia through the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) can only be achieved through cultural and literary exchanges.https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2016/08/03/the-illusion-of- asean-and-how-literature-can-help.html She also writes about Australian intellectual contribution to Indonesia, praising Australian scholars for grooming the country's critical minds.https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2016/09/07/australia-indonesia- cultural-relationship-those-who-shaped-our-critical-mind.html In various interviews, Okky has clearly positioned herself on many issues. More than just appealing to the masses or attracting wide readership, she believes that writing is a way of fighting for the advancement of humanity. In her novels, she also consistently tries to voice problems within the society, including discrimination, oppression and unjust treatment by the state or the ruling elites. In several interviews and speeches, Okky stated that she reads Karl Marx and is influenced by the spirit of his human liberation ideas and also Michel Foucault for his inspiration for her critical thinking,https://seleb.tempo.co/read/777188/sentuhan-pemikiran-foucault-di- novel-terbaru-okky-madasari but above all she believes in individual freedom and human creativity. For her, ultimate freedom can only be achieved through freeing individual creativity. While her views have been very clear in her novels, speeches and interviews, she actively voices the need for her generation to take side with the unprotected minority and weakest part of the society as well as joining street rallies to condemn use of violence by the state, police and mass organizations. She is fiercely against religious-based organizations that take the law into their hands, and use their power to oppress the weak minority groups in Indonesia. Academic Beside writing fiction, Okky is now seriously venturing into academic world with main interests and focus on the Sociology of Literature, the Sociology of Knowledge, power and knowledge production, religion as ideology and power, freedom of expression and censorship, critical view on education, history and the construction of literature. Doctoral Program Okky is currently a PhD candidate with the Malay Studies Department of the National University of Singapore (NUS) under a research scholarship from the university since 2019. Apart from receiving NUS Research Scholarship, she was also awarded the Dean's Fellowship, a very prestigious award of the NUS, and will only be offered to the top incoming PhD studentshttps://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/research/scholarship/sch-dpf.html She is now doing her PhD thesis on cultural censorship in Indonesia after the fall of Suharto as she believes that rather than disappearing censorship in post Suharto has been more frequent, especially in the Joko Widodo presidency.https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/majalah/2015/11/151116_majalah_sensor_sekitar_kitahttps://www.indonesiana.id/read/92021/begini- momok-lembaga-sensor-di-mata-mereka She has been expressing how proud and honored she has been to be with the Malay Studies Department, which she says among the first, if not the first, to seriously develop social theories by using local and indigenous sources of knowledge as opposed to just be dependent on Western sources.https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oZN0-AVsJ/ Bachelor and master's degree Okky graduated from Gadjah Mada University's International Relations Department in 2005 with bachelor's degree in Political Science. In 2012, she pursued her master's degree in sociology with the University of Indonesia, and graduated in July 2014. Iowa International Writing Program In 2017, Okky was selected by the US government to represent Indonesia for the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, US, from August to October 2017, where she engaged in various programs with local community, including speaking about Indonesia's culture to local and international audience. That year, the legendary program celebrated its half a century anniversary.https://www.vice.com/en_asia/article/vbbjkj/how-to-break-into- america-as-a-writer NUS Resident Writer/Visiting Fellow From January to June 2018, Okky was invited as resident writer and visiting fellow by the National University of Singapore.She delivered speeches about literature and society in front of Singaporean audiences at various venues, including schools, art center, communities. Global Activism European Speeches In 2017, Okky was invited to speak at the Berlin Literature Festival in Germany on literature and about her works as well as about Indonesia in general.https://www.literaturfestival.com/autoren-en/autoren-2017-en/okky- madasari A year before Okky was invited by University of Warwick in United Kingdom to speak about the role of culture and literature in forging ASEAN prosperity and unity.http://warwickaseanconference.com/conference-2016/speakers/ In 2015, she was invited by the Austrian government to speak at the Islam and Women's Contemporary Literature in Hittisau, Austria. In October that year, okky was one of Indonesian writers featured at the Frankfurt Book Fair, where Indonesia was the guest of honor. In 2014, Okky was invited to speak about literature and society at the Douarnenez Film Festival in France. Iowa International Writing Program In 2017, Okky was selected by the US government to represent Indonesia for the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, US, from August to October 2017, where she engaged in various programs with local community, including speaking about Indonesia's culture to local and international audience. That year, the legendary program celebrated its half a century anniversary. Southeast Asian Engagement Okky has been invited to speak at Singapore Writer Festival, Philippine Literary Festival and Kuala Lumpur Book Fair. She co-founded the ASEAN Literary Festival in 2014, and is the program director of the festival. In 2019, Okky was nominated for Southeast Asia's Women of the Future Awards for her contribution in advancement of the region's culture.https://awards.womenofthefuture.co.uk/seasia/ ASEAN Literary Festival Okky in 2014 co-founded (with Indonesian journalist Abdul Khalik) the ASEAN Literary Festival with aims among others to introduce ASEAN writers and their works to the global world while providing medium for writers to exchange ideas and works so that they are familiar with each other in helping shape the so-called ASEAN community. The first ASEAN Literary Festival took place in Jakarta in March, 2014. The festival quickly becomes one of the region's most important annual cultural events. In the 2016 festival, the Indonesian police were trying to ban the festival by withdrawing the permit it had previously issued due to protests from militant organisations against the festival's insistence to prominently feature discussions of LGBT and 1965 Communist massacre issues. But with public support and the organizers' persistence, the festival prevailed, and gained even more wide coverage and popularity subsequently. Judging Experience Okky has become judge for a number of international and local literary competition and events, including Singapore Book Prize, Golden Point Award (an award for manuscript held by Singapore's National Arts Council) and Khatulistiwa Literary Award.https://newnaratif.com/journalism/the-survival-of-malay-fiction-in- singapore/share/xuna/2e0a791950a53842e60d83295368cdff/ Expert Witness In her commitment to freedom of expression and fighting against censorship as well as protection of minority, Okky has become an expert witness for students of University of Sumatera Utara in a recent censorship case in Sumatera Utara Administrative Court against the university's rector who dissolved the whole editorial team of a student press, Suara USU, because of the publication of a short story.https://tirto.id/sidang-gugatan-suara-usu-okky-madasari-cerpen- bukan-pornografi-ejaa, https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2019/12/05/trials-of-fiction-we-lose- the-battle-again.html Personal life Okky is married to Abdul Khalik, a journalist with English-language newspapers in Indonesia (The Jakarta Post, 2003-2012, and Jakarta Globe, 2012‚Äìpresent).

Etymology \\"AnutpƒÅda\\" means \\"having no origin\\", \\"not coming into existence\\", \\"not taking effect\\", \\"non-production\\".Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, AnutpƒÅda * \\"An\\" also means \\"not\\", or \\"non\\" * \\"UtpƒÅda\\" means \\"genesis\\", \\"coming forth\\", \\"birth\\" Usage in Buddhist tradition The Buddhist tradition uses the term \\"anutpƒÅda\\" for the absence of an origin or sunyata (voidness). AnutpƒÅda means that dharmas, the constituting elements of reality, do not come into existence. Ati≈õa: Chandrakirti, in his Yuktisastikavrrti, states: According to Nakamura in his study of Advaita Vedanta, the Buddhist paramƒÅrtha, \\"highest truth\\", is identified with anutpƒÅda The term paramƒÅrtha is a synonym for tattva, tathata, sunyata, animitta, bhutakoti and dharmadhatu. One who understands sunyata, anutpada and dependent arising, has realized the ultimate truth and gains nirvana. Nagarjuna: AnutpƒÅda is one of the important features of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ Sutras and Madhyamaka. The term is also used in the Lankavatara Sutra. According to D.T Suzuki, \\"anutpada\\" is not the opposite of \\"utpada\\", but transcends opposites. It is the seeing into the true nature of existence, the seeing that \\"all objects are without self-substance\\". Another well-known use is in Bankei's \\"Unborn\\". Influence on Gaudapada Gaudapada- karika characterizes Brahman-Atman Absolute with the concept of \\"AjƒÅtivƒÅda\\". It is a fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada. In Gaudapada-Karika, chapter III, verses 46-48, Gaudapada states that Brahman never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself: According to Gaudapada, the Absolute has no origin, and is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is aja, the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered Maya (unreal, changing, transitory), and not ontologically independent reality. Gaudapada's concept of \\"ajƒÅta\\" is similar to Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy. The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term \\"anutpƒÅda\\" for the absence of an origin or ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ. But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna. Gaudapada's perspective is based on the Mandukya Upanishad. According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (paramƒÅrthatƒÅ) the phenomenal world is mƒÅyƒÅ, changing and not what it seems to be.M Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 25, 160-161Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, , page 119 The Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism.RD Karmarkar, Gaudapada's Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of \\"Brahman, Atman or Turiya\\" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.

The episode premiered on February 16, 2013 on The Hub. In the episode, the destinies and cutie marks of Twilight Sparkle's friends get switched around, forcing Twilight to create a magic spell of her own in order to correct it. The title itself is a reference to the Beatles' 1967 album Magical Mystery Tour. Part of the episode focused on Twilight Sparkle becoming a princess and transforming into an alicorn. The Hub heavily emphasized the event while promoting the episode in a coronation-themed advertising sweepstakes campaign, which included a special concert event featuring Miss America 2013 winner Mallory Hagan, and a nine-episode marathon which preceded the episode's premiere. Plot Twilight Sparkle awakens one morning to find that her friends' cutie marks and duties around Ponyville have swapped: Rarity's creativity in doing Rainbow Dash's weather control causes havoc around town; Rainbow is unable to tame Fluttershy's animals, who run wild around her cottage; Fluttershy's attempts to throw Pinkie Pie's parties disappoint the residents of Ponyville, who become grumpy and tetchy; Pinkie has difficulties working on Applejack's farm, where her apple trees are now bare and blackened; and Applejack's dressmaking skills are awful, forcing her to close Rarity's boutique. Twilight's friends are unaware of the change, believing that they are following their true destinies despite them being unskilled with their tasks. Twilight remembers that Princess Celestia had earlier sent her the notebook of unicorn wizard Star Swirl the Bearded, believing that Twilight has the skill to make sense of the incomplete spell on the last page. However, when Twilight first read the spell, it inadvertently switched around the Elements of Harmony, affecting their respective bearers. Realizing that she is responsible for her friends' condition, and with no counter-spell to fix it, Twilight cries in her bedroom, blaming herself for her friends' misery and Ponyville's resulting desolation. However, inspired by Spike's compassion, Twilight realizes that if she shows her friends their true destinies and reminds them of what they mean to each other, she may be able to reverse the spell. One by one, she shows each of her friends what their true calling is, encouraging them to help each other fix things. Each friend regains her original cutie mark with the help of her respective Element, and Ponyville is quickly restored to normal. Twilight realizes that friendship is a factor Star Swirl never accounted for, and is able to complete the spell. Upon doing so, the Elements worn by her friends activate on their own, engulfing Twilight in a bright light and causing her to disappear. Twilight awakens in an ethereal place where she is greeted by Princess Celestia, who congratulates her and declares that Twilight is ready for a new stage in her life. Twilight undergoes a transformation and returns to Ponyville as a winged unicorn known as an alicorn. Her friends are amazed and happily welcome her change, while Celestia announces that Twilight is no longer her student, but a princess who has demonstrated leadership and other positive attributes during her stay in Ponyville. Twilight becomes concerned that she has no idea what to do now as she is no longer Celestia's student, but Celestia promises that they will all help each other to learn. Twilight is officially crowned in a grand celebration in Canterlot, and she thanks her friends for being there to help her. Production On the topic of Twilight's ascension to becoming a princess, writer Meghan McCarthy explained that Twilight had been embarking on a journey since the first episode of the series that would eventually lead to this outcome. McCarthy explained that the title of princess in Equestria has to be earned by sharing their gifts with others, and that \\"every little girl wants to be a princess, and not everybody can get to be a princess‚Äîbut you can live up to the ideals that should come along with being a princess.\\" McCarthy noted that, despite Twilight's new role and the new challenges she will face, her personality will remain the same. McCarthy considers the episode as the first part of a story arc that would continue with the two-part season four premiere episode \\"Princess Twilight Sparkle\\", which premiered on November 23, 2013. When asked of what was stopping Twilight from casting the spell, Larson responded that the script \\"didn't include Starswirl's unfinished spell\\" and that \\"it was heavily altered from his final script.\\" =Featured songs= The episode is primarily a musical. The show's composer Daniel Ingram created seven songs with episode's writer, M.A. Larson who wrote two songs. Ingram wrote most of the songs' lyrics for \\"I've Got to Find a Way\\", \\"A True, True Friend\\", \\"Celestia's Ballad\\", \\"Behold, Princess Twilight Sparkle\\", and, with assistance from Larson, \\"What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me\\". The lyrics for both \\"Morning in Ponyville\\" and \\"Life in Equestria\\" were written by Larson. Under the title \\"Find a Way\\", a full version of the song \\"I've Got to Find a Way\\" is included on the album \\"Songs of Ponyville\\". # Morning in Ponyville ‚Äì Rebecca Shoichet # What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me ‚Äì Ashleigh Ball, Andrea Libman, Shannon Chan-Kent and Kazumi Evans # I've Got To Find a Way ‚Äì Shoichet # A True, True Friend ‚Äì Shoichet, Ball, Libman, Chan-Kent, Evans and Ensemble # Celestia's Ballad ‚Äì Nicole Oliver # Behold, Princess Twilight Sparkle ‚Äì Choir # Life in Equestria ‚Äì Shoichet and Ensemble Promotion On February 9, 2013, The Hub held a \\"Coronation Concert\\" in Los Angeles to promote the episode, hosted by Miss America 2013 winner Mallory Hagan. Despite stating that she was more of a Strawberry Shortcake fan growing up, Hagan felt honored to participate in the event since she supported the series' aim to teach lessons about friendship and acceptance, considering it \\"a great way to show little girls that they can be empowered by trying to reach their goals.\\" The premiere of \\"Magical Mystery Cure\\" on The Hub was also preceded by a marathon of previous Friendship is Magic episodes. Hasbro also released new merchandise later in the year featuring Twilight Sparkle's new princess form. Broadcast and reception \\"Magical Mystery Cure\\" premiered on The Hub on February 16, 2013. The premiere had the highest ratings on all demographics and outperformed its key competitors, such as Disney XD and Cartoon Network. The show also earned year-to-year time period delivery gains among Kids 2-11 (+111%), Girls 2-11 (+80%), Kids 6-11 (+187%), Girls 6-11 (+177%), Adults 18-49 (+139%), Women 18-49 (+216%), Adults 25-54 (+116%) and Women 25-54 (+184%). Ed Liu of ToonZone (now Anime Superhero) considered the episode felt \\"rushed and perfunctory\\", having nearly two separate stories that would have been told better across two separate episodes, and considered that the large number of songs was a contributing factor towards this. While Liu did not consider it a poor episode of the series, he felt the show had done better with emotional conclusions in previous seasons. Daniel Alvarez of Unleash the Fanboy also acknowledged that the musical format took away time from the story element, but otherwise considered it a \\"very grand episode\\". The episode, and its composers, Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews, received the 2013 Leo Award for \\"Best Musical Score in an Animated Program or Series\\". The revelation that Twilight Sparkle would become an alicorn was announced several weeks before the episode's premiere, though this had been rumored months before based on photos of upcoming toy lines from Hasbro. The \\"brony\\" fanbasewhich encompasses older viewers who had grown to appreciate the serieshad mixed reviews to this announcement, with a significant fraction considering it a \\"jump the shark\\" moment for the show. Shaun Scotellaro of the fan site Equestria Daily considered this a normal reaction to any changes to the show by the fans, but considered that because many of the older fans connect with Twilight Sparkle as a bookish nerdy character, changes such as this would be dramatic. McCarthy and others on the production team have further countered these complaints, with McCarthy stating that \\"What we didn‚Äôt want to do was change who [Twilight] is as a character, because she‚Äôs certainly someone that everyone‚Äôs proud to know and love\\", while Tara Strong, the voice actress for Twilight, claimed that the episode is \\"a birth of a new era for Twilight, but not the end of what makes the show so wonderful\\". Home media release The season 3 finale is part of the \\"Princess Twilight Sparkle\\" Region 1 DVD by Shout! Factory which was made available in stores on April 30, 2013. Along with the season finale, the DVD also includes the episodes \\"Games Ponies Play\\" (Season 3, Episode 12), \\"Magic Duel\\" (Season 3, Episode 5), \\"MMMystery on the Friendship Express\\" (Season 2, Episode 24), and \\"Lesson Zero\\" (Season 2, Episode 3).

The painting measures and is now owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Background  Aurora Borealis is based on two separate sketches.Truettner, W. H. (1970). \\"The Genesis of Frederic Edwin Church's Aurora Boreolis\\". Art Quarterly, XXXI, Fall 1968, pp. 266‚Äì83. The first incident was an aurora witnessed by Church's pupil, the Arctic explorer Isaac I. Hayes. Hayes provided a sketch and description of the aurora borealis display he witnessed one January evening. Coinciding with Hayes' furthest northern movement into what he named Cape Leiber, the aurora borealis appeared over the peak. Describing the event, Hayes wrote: > The light grew by degrees more and more intense, and from irregular bursts > it settled into an almost steady sheet of brightness... The exhibition, at > first tame and quiet, became in the end startling in its brilliancy. The > broad dome above me is all ablaze... The colour of the light was chiefly > red, but this was not constant, and every hue mingled in the fierce display. > Blue and yellow streamers were playing in the lurid fire; and, sometimes > starting side by side from the wide expanse of the illuminated arch, they > melt into each other, and throw a ghostly glare of green into the face and > over the landscape. Again this green overrides the red; blue and orange > clasp each other in their rapid flight; violet darts tear through a broad > flush of yellow, and countless tongues of white flame, formed of these > uniting streams, rush aloft and lick the skies.  Description and influences  The iconography of the painting suggested personal and nationalistic references. The peak in the painting had been named after Church during Hayes's expedition. Aurora Borealis incorporated details of Hayes' ship, drawn from a sketch he brought back upon returning from his expedition. Contrasted with Church's earlier painting of the north, The Icebergs (1861), the intact ship highlights Hayes' achievement in navigating this space, as well as the state of the nation in navigating the contentious historical moment. Presenting the ship's safe passage through the dark Arctic environment, Church suggested optimism for the future; a tiny light shines out from the ship's window. Charles Millard describes Church's paintings as \\"large in scale and size, sharply horizontal in format\\" and \\"dramatic in subject, but yielding in execution, and tend[ing] to exploit both value contrast and continuous tonal transition.\\" Church's works, including Aurora Borealis, were completed using small touches of pigment built together through thin applications, leaving the viewer unaware of fracture between strokes. These works are also built around the tones of \\"ochre, brown, gray going to blue or green, and green\\" at the expense of the full value of color.  Exhibition  Completed in New York that winter, Aurora Borealis was exhibited publicly in London in 1865 as a triumvirate with two paintings by Church of Ecuadoran volcanoes: Cotopaxi (his 1862 painting of an eruption) and Chimborazo (his 1864 reprise of the dormant mountain that had been the subject of his 1858 masterwork Heart of the Andes).  Reception and legacy  Rainy Season in the Tropics, 1866. Created at the end of the American Civil War, Aurora Borealis (1865) was believed to depict the portent of a simultaneously triumphant and desolate Union victory, its meaning amplified in relation to later works, including The After Glow (1867) and other works. Aurora Borealis (1865) was associated with Rainy Season in the Tropics (1866) for two reasons. First, the two paintings marked the completion of the arctic-tropical sequence created with The Heart of the Andes (1859) and The North, also known as The Icebergs (1861). These pairings drew together popular attention on exploration of the arctic North and the tropical South. The second association between Aurora Borealis and Rainy Season in the Tropics was established through their compositions and \\"in their luminosity\\", where each suggested a \\"renewed optimism in natural and historic events\\".

Founded in 1826 through lottery subscription and constructed the following year, it became part of the public school system in 1876 and was closed in 1929. The school building survives and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 5, 1972. It presently houses the town historical society and chamber of commerce. Construction The school building was constructed in two phases. The original building was a five bay, two and half story structure topped with an octagonal belfry (since converted into a closed cupola). The exterior walls are brick covered in stucco, the result of a trip to Philadelphia by a trustee sent to investigate the possibility. An annex was constructed around 1872, also of brick but painted rather than stuccoed. Both the annex and the original portion feature round-headed dormers to light the attic. There are three rooms on each floor and a central hall in the original section. This layout remains unchanged though the interior has been updated considerably over the years to accommodate the various tenants. History The academy had its genesis in an 1824 petition by a group of local farmers and merchants to the general assembly, asking that they be allowed to hold a lottery to construct a building for \\"an academy and elementary school, and also a room for public worship.\\" The petition was granted to allow $6000 to be raised; this was amended the following year to $10,000. The lottery was sold in May 1825, and an initial six acre land purchase was made in November; one tenant refused to vacate, however, and William Crawford, one of the trustees of the nascent academy, donated an adjacent two acre lot the following May. The cornerstone was laid in August, and the school finally opened in October 1827. The school operated as a private academy until 1876. In that year the building was leased to the two local public school districts, and the private academy was abandoned. Two years later the public schools were consolidated into a single Middletown school district, centered on the old academy building. Classes continued to be held there until 1929, when a new public school building was opened in the town. Eventually the academy trustees sold the building to the federal government, which planned to build a post office on the property. Popular reaction led to the formation of the St. Georges Hundred Historical Society, which took possession of the building in 1945. The town purchased the property in 1960, and over the years used it to house offices, a library, a police station and a meeting hall.

According to the charity, Global H2O has funded over 30 projects in Northern Uganda, helping 60,000 people to obtain clean drinking water from the production of standard United Nations designed boreholes (deep wells with hand pumps). It now operates in the UK, Germany and USA for fundraising purposes. It has also partnered with the Royal Order of Saint Lazarus in Ireland to deliver clean drinking water to the impoverished of Northern Uganda Global H2O is not politically oriented, not religion oriented, all volunteer, with the goal for efficient investment of donor funds (at least 80% of funds must be allocated to projects) Mission Water in Uganda According to the official charity web site (www.globalh2o.org), the mission statement is as follows: \\"Our goal at Global H2O is to provide clean water sources to communities through construction of wells, rain harvesting facilities, and spring boxes. We contract with organizations in developing countries to identify where we can significantly improve lives in a short period of time, with minimal expense and complexity. A $20 donation provides clean water to one person for the rest of his or her life. The water problem is vast, but the solution is simple and effective.\\" A Clean Water Initiative Wilde discovered the water crisis during an expedition in the Himalaya on Cho Oyu, the world's sixth highest mountain. According to his web site (www.jamesdewittwilde.com), James fell ill with dysentery and it was during these moments of agony during the descent that he \\"understood\\" the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene issues (WASH). Using PR from his 7 Summits campaign and thanks to the help of Sage Business Solutions, Modry Design Studio, and Great Outdoor Provision Company, he secured the initial funding and key fundraising software for Global H2O. Global H2O's first well As a result of funding provided for his Everest expedition in 2010, Wilde decided to self fund his expedition and use the sponsors funds to finance the very first water project in 2010. He was accompanied by Madara Repse, a professional photographer/ journalist, who in turn shot the photos which have become the face of the company today. The project which was completed in February 2010 is still in use today, and Wilde makes a point of visiting it every time he is in Northern Uganda. Wilde's vision which was immediately shared by his partners, Chris Wooten and David Simons was to build an all volunteer team with a clear focus on efficiency of allocation of donations to projects. The company commits as part of its policy to ensure that at least 80% of all donations make their way into projects. The current level is 91% according to their web site. The tenets were quickly developed to include non affiliation to religion or politics and to demonstrate all work completed on behalf of the donors. The company grew rapidly during the ensuing two years adding affiliated Limited Liability Companies in Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The company has seen 350% donation growth on average per year since its inception across all affiliates. Madara Repse & Global H2O Board Members and Executive Committee During this time, Chris Wooten joined the board as Chief Marketing Officer and Davis Simons became Administrative Officer. Later, the board grew to include Michael Sosnowy as Chief Financial Officer and Stefanus van der Merwe as Chief Operating Officer and David Humphrey as non-executive voting member. Later, Executive Committee Members joined as the international affiliates grew within the organisation. David Humphrey (Head of Germany & now permanent Board Member), Virginia Anne Newton (Head of Fundraising) and Rob Shaw (Head of the United Kingdom) are all part of the decision team. The South Sudanese Refugee Crisis in Uganda In 2014, Global H2O undertook an initiative together with its supplier Sub Saharan Drilling U LTD to install 20 wells in three different refugee camps in Uganda. Phase one consisted of eight wells which were installed in the Kiryandongo and Rwamwanja Camps- four in each. These were funded thanks to donations from Stop Hunger Now (a Raleigh, North Carolina based charity focused on hunger relief via donated meals) Christ Church and the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina. Phase two consists of 12 wells and 10 latrines which will be built in the Lamwo installations near the South Sudanese border. These were funded thanks to donations received from Knorr Bremse Global Care, Tantris Restaurant (Thanksgiving 2014), STI Consulting and B.telligent. These wells and latrines will be completed by May 2015. Phase three which is currently in the funding stage, involves a much larger investment of over $1 million. Annual fundraisers The core events currently occur in Munich, Germany, Charlotte and Raleigh North Carolina. Thanksgiving (Munich, Germany) The Thanksgiving event, sponsored by the Eichbauer family (owners of the world-famous Tantris Restaurant in Munich), takes place every year on Thanksgiving with all proceeds from the food and drinks benefitting the charity. Thanksgiving Fundraiser Oktoberfest (Raleigh, North Carolina) In Raleigh, the US team has created Oktoberfest in a response to the well established Thanksgiving event. Silent auctions, beer, sausages, pretzels and great music from the Little German Band help the team to also create a fun atmosphere for helping the people in Uganda. NODA Grand Prix (Charlotte, North Carolina) Lastly, in the hope to bring the sporting community into the fray, the NODA Grand Prix was created and has become a huge success. All ages and types of racers gather in the spring in Charlotte to compete for prizes or simply for fun... all for the benefit of Global H2O. Christmas (Dublin, Ireland) The Royal Order of the Hospitaller of St Lazarus of Jerusalem in Dublin has invited Global H2O the last two consecutive years to be their international charity of choice. Moving Mountains The story of Global H2O is captured in the recently published Autobiography of James Wilde, Moving Mountains. The book contains details of Wilde's climbing background and how it transformed into the idea to form a charity focused on bringing clean drinking water to those in need. According to the charity, the proceeds of all books sold are going to benefit the charity directly.

(Musgum also is spelled as Moosgoum.) The dwellings were built in a variety of shapes, such as tall domed or conical dwellings or huts, some with a reverse-V shape, and others with geometric designs. Musgums are an example of earth structures. Of simple design, they are constructed of mud, thatch, and water by local residents using few tools. Resembling the shape of beehives or shells, they are also known as \\"cases obus\\". They are adobe structures, a variant of cob, and are in the catenary arch form, which can bear maximum weight with the minimum use of building materials. The dwellings also are described as \\"beehive type\\" because of their dome shape. They are considered to be an important architectural style of Cameroon, although not in fashion in the present day. History The houses were built with earth, following a traditional practice before the advent of cement. These structures are no longer popular, however, as they are considered to be outdated. Very few Musgums build them now. Architecture Traditional huts of the Musgum people Musgum huts, rain season Musgum Huts Traditional hut The Musgum people in Cameroon constructed their mud houses with compressed sun-dried mud. Earth is still used as a building material and appears environmentally more acceptable for low cost housing, as cement production releases large amounts of carbon emissions. Mud is laid over a thatch of lashed reeds. They are compared to adobe structures or variants of cob structures, which are made from sand, clay, water, and some kind of fibrous or organic material such as sticks, straw, and/or manure. Although of simple design, they are well planned from a utility viewpoint. The houses were built with geometric designs. They were built in the shape of a shell in inverted-‚ÄúV‚Äô or conical form. Ronald Rael, an architect and author of the book entitled Earth Architecture, has observed that the Musgum houses are of \\"a catenary arch‚Äîthe ideal mathematical form,\\" which can withstand the load of the building with minimum use of material. Because of the inverted form of an arc of a chain, the domes are slim and work on the principle of compression providing rigidity to the structure without any twisting or bending moments. The geometric patterns on the exterior face of the domes provide a foothold for workers who stand on them during construction and also during subsequent maintenance. The exterior design and large height of the structures (nearly ) keeps the houses cool inside on hot summer days. A small circular opening at the top of the huts also helps with air circulation and is used as an escape hatch if subjected to flooding. This circular opening, a few inches in diameter, also known as a smoke hole, is closed with a slab or a pot during the rains to prevent water entering the house. Entrance is provided by a single door, which is narrow up to knee level, but widens at shoulder level, and is said to resemble a keyhole. Musgums form part of a complex of housing units, granaries, and a central courtyard enclosed within a thatched compound wall. The walls are connected to provide access. The exterior surfaces are grooved so that rain water can drain easily. The complex also is protected with fencing. Space is provided for expansion of the dwelling units for each new wife or daughter-in-law or, for additions to the family. The technique adopted during construction is called the mud coil pottery technique. In this method, the mud layers are placed spirally with each lift of about 0.5 m. Each lift is allowed to dry before the next one is added. The walls are thicker at the base, gradually thinning out toward the top, thereby contributing to the structure's stability. The relief lines are created as the construction proceeds upward in the \\"V\\" shape or with straight line grooves to facilitate quick and easy draining of water when it rains.

By combining a digital television solution (a television, set-top box, personal video recorder or other type of receiver) with a speech synthesis engine, blind and partially sighted people are able to access information that is displayed to other users visually on the screen and therefore can operate the menus and electronic program guides of the receiver. User need Using an audiovisual medium involves obvious problems for certain groups of people with disabilities, notably individuals with sight or hearing loss. These problems can be split between interface accessibility barriers and impediments in using the content itself. Text-to-speech in television products is a feature that addresses interface accessibility barriers for blind and partially sighted people who are unable to use in the standard visual interface even where this has special features such as large fonts, magnifiers, adjustable colour schemes, etc. Digital television solutions are often more complicated products compared to their analogue ancestors. The ability to navigate many menus, to see on-screen program information and to browse electronic program guides or on-screen content listings to find out what is available to watch ‚Äì these are all essential to using digital TV. Policy makers across the world have recognized the importance of access to (digital) television: * Recital 64 of the EU‚Äôs Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS) states: \\"The right of persons with a disability and of the elderly to participate and be integrated in the social and cultural life of the Community is inextricably linked to the provision of accessible audiovisual media services.\\" * The initial report of a European Commission study \\"Measuring progress of eAccessibility in Europe\\" refers to television as one of a set of fields \\"that are now essential elements of social and economic life\\". * The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities makes specific reference to television access services in Article 30(1) (\\"Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport\\"): \\"States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to take part on an equal basis with others in cultural life, and shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities: [...] b. Enjoy access to television programmes, films, theatre and other cultural activities, in accessible formats\\". History Text-to-speech software has been widely available for desktop computers since the 1990s and Moore‚Äôs Law increases in CPU and memory capabilities have contributed to making their inclusion in software and hardware solutions more feasible. In the wake of these trends in information technology, text-to-speech is finding its way into everyday consumer electronics. In addition to text-to-speech solutions for computers, there are now talking watches and clocks, calendars, thermometers, kitchen aids and many other products. Talking books have also been around for some time, and GPS navigation systems have become widely used as well. Organisations representing blind and partially sighted people are long- standing supporters of text-to-speech technology in consumer electronics. In the UK, the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has been arguing for speaking radio and television products since the early years of the century and has supported manufacturers in creating such solutions. The Digital TV Group, the UK Industry association for Digital TV, first discussed the topic in 2007 and subsequently brought the industry together to write a technical specification for Text to Speech in the horizontal market in 2009. This formed part of the UK Government BERR Usability Action Plan. When complete, this was submitted to Digital Europe for ETSI standardisation and also published as a White Paper. Subsequently this was incorporated in the U-Book - UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines, including Text to Speech. In 2010, two talking products for digital television came onto the market in the UK. The Sky Talker is an add-on for the Sky set top box. It provides talking features for programme and channel information and play back control. The Sky Talker is operated through the standard Sky remote control. In the same year, the Smart Talk Freeview (terrestrial digital broadcasting) set-top box was also launched onto the UK market. This is a Goodmans branded Freeview set top box, developed by a partnership between Harvard International Ltd and the RNIB. It was the first complete talking solution for digital television in the UK, including speaking of the Electronic Programme Guide, menus and providing spoken assistance during setup. In Japan, both Panasonic and Mitsubishi Electric have been producing television and Blu-ray products since 2010. According to information compiled by the Japanese blindness organisation Lighthouse for the Blind there are some 70-odd products from Mitsubishi and a similar amount from Panasonic with talking features. Around 2011, in Spain a talking, Linux-based, set-top box solution using the free Festival text-to-speech engine, was distributed to blind and visually impaired people free of charge by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. This product is however no longer available. In 2012, Panasonic launched its Voice Guidance solution on the UK market. This is a set of talking features for their 2012 Viera range (and beyond). Voice Guidance announces on-screen information and the most important menus and has support for reminders, recording and playback functions. It is available for Freesat and Freeview receivers. In creating its solution, Panasonic took into account advice from RNIB experts. Also in 2012, TVonics, a former UK digital video recorder maker, launched its talking PVR solution, a twin-tuner Freeview HD recorder based on the Ivona TTS engine which is widely lauded by disability groups for its high quality voice. The TVonics solution was essentially a software addition for its existing platform and can be deployed as a software upgrade to customers of existing products. TVonics went into administration in June 2012. The RNIB acquired the core DVR IP including the text-to-speech system. The TVonics brand was bought by Peterborough-based Pulse-Eight. Features of text-to- speech for television As a primary purpose of text-to-speech in television products is to render these accessible to blind and partially sighted people, talking features ideally should cover all television operations, from the initial setup, over basic and advanced receiver functions to programming and playback. In practice, there are significant technical challenges, in particular with regard to dynamic information, interactive applications, catch-up and on-demand functions in Connected TVs and dialogue handling that mean that none of the current text-to-speech products cover 100% of all features through their talking interface. The main principle in developing text-to-speech solutions for digital television products should be to create a talking interface that achieves functional equivalence of what a sighted user can do using the default (visual) interface. Specifically, the intention is that a person operating the solution via the text-to-speech system gets the same feedback and can perform the same tasks as someone doing this via the default interface (commonly the screen in combination with a remote control). =List of possible text-to-speech enabled features= * Initial set up and configuration (for Connected TVs this could include the network configuration, including authentication to the home network). * Power cycle control (on, off, standby). * Announcing the currently showing channel and programme, plus the list of available channels. * Assistance and feedback for basic receiver functions such as change channel and volume control. * Speaking the Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) and assisting the user in navigation of the EPG and other lists of services and content, including browsing on-demand and catch-up content and previously recorded or downloaded content as well as user customisable lists (favourites etc.). * Spoken feedback for reporting and changing the state of access services (in particular Audio Description, see Support for Audio Description/Video Description). * Talking features in support of playback and recording, including managing the recording schedule. * Notification of pay-per-view and other restricted content, restrictions and conditions and control over these functions, including the authorisation mechanism. * Feedback and control for on-screen information banners, dialogues and menus (including modal and other out-of band prompts). Interaction with interactive services and widgets. * Customisation of the talking features (see Customisation of talking features). * Speaking of on-screen manuals and help pages. =Customisation of talking features= Different consumers have different profiles of abilities and preferences. This is also true for blind and partially sighted people using text-to-speech enabled television products. In addition, novice users tend to require more guidance in the early stages of using a product, whereas more advanced users will prefer to be able to navigate the system as efficiently as possible. Consequently, the text-to- speech part of a talking television solution should allow user control and customisation options over its functions: * Users should be able to set the volume level of the text-to-speech output independently of the main television sound level. * Users should also be able to adjust properties such as text-to- speech voice type, pitch and output speed. * Good implementations also allow the verbosity of what is spoken to be adjusted, from very verbose (usually for novice users) to only the bare essentials (useful for advanced users very familiar with the system). =Support for Audio Description/Video Description= As blind and partially sighted users are the main target group for text-to-speech in digital television, particular attention should be given to supporting those features of the product that are of most value to this consumer group. In particular, the ability to control the Audio Description/Video Description related settings of the product is of great importance to these users in those countries where such services are available. Audio Description/Video Description provides an additional narrative describing visual actions or elements that a blind or partially sighted person would not see, but which are important in order to follow the story. Typically, the narration includes characters, scene changes, on screen text and other visual clues not otherwise included in the default sound stream. Talking features in the product should support in full the menus and other controls relating to Audio Description/Video Description (which also includes advertising the availability of this access service for content when browsing the Electronic Programme Guide and other content inventories).

This White Paper has since been subsumed into the publication UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines (known as the U-Book). The same White Paper was also used as the basis for a discussion between disability user groups and DigitalEurope, a European industry body for manufacturers of consumer equipment, on the topic of text-to-speech for television. The DigitalEurope work stream led to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) setting up a project group (IEC 62731) to create an International Standard for text-to-speech in digital television. The first edition of the standard, IEC 62731:2013 was published officially as an International Standard in January 2013. The Standard does not dictate implementation, but provides a functional description on how a text- to-speech enabled television product should behave and what should be spoken when.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ellesmere, the archdeaconry of Salop, and the diocese of Lichfield. Its benefice is united with those of St Martin, Little Ness, and St John the Baptist, Ruyton-XI-Towns. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The church originated as a collegiate church in the Saxon era, and is recorded in the Domesday Book. The nave and the tower of the present church date from the 13th century, and the chancel from the early part of the following century. The upper part of the tower was either added or rebuilt during the 17th century. The south porch was described as being \\"nearly new\\" in 1824. In 1852 the chancel was re-roofed, and the church was partly restored in 1880. The vestry was added in the late 19th century.

History  During the preparatory process of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesberg, South Africa, in 2002, the governments of Italy and Switzerland, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) embarked on an effort to organize a new partnership to strengthen cooperation and more effectively address the needs of mountain peoples and environments around the world. As a result, the International Partnership for Sustainable Development of Mountain Regions, known as the Mountain Partnership, was launched.  Membership  The Mountain Partnership currently has 370 members, comprising governments, intergovernmental organizations and major groups from civil society, NGOs and the private sector. The following governments are currently members of the Mountain Partnership. * Afghanistan * Algeria * Andorra * Argentina * Armenia * Austria * Azerbaijan * Bangladesh * Bhutan * Bolivia * Burundi * Cameroon * Chile * Colombia * Costa Rica * Cuba * Democratic Republic of Congo * Dominican Republic * Ecuador * Ethiopia * France * Georgia * Ghana * Guatemala * Guinea * India * Indonesia * Iran * Italy * Jamaica * Jordan * Kenya * Kyrgyzstan * Lesotho * Liechtenstein * Macedonia * Madagascar * Malawi * Mexico * Monaco * Morocco * Nepal * Pakistan * Papua New Guinea * Peru * Philippines * Romania * Serbia * Slovakia * Slovenia * Spain * Sri Lanka * Swaziland * Switzerland * Togo * Tunisia * Turkey * Uganda * Ukraine * Venezuela * Yemen  Organization  The Mountain Partnership is supported by a secretariat based at the FAO in Rome, Italy. The secretariat plays a facilitating role, connecting institutions and helping members develop joint activities to protect mountain regions.  Work  The work of the Mountain Partnership is spread out among four pillars, namely: advocacy, communications, brokering initiatives and capacity development. The Mountain Partnership works to bring global attention to achieving sustainable development in mountain regions and to promote the inclusion of mountain issues in United Nations declarations and other international documents. Members also engage in disseminating awareness with regards to challenges faced by mountain peoples and environments. Furthermore, the Mountain Partnership‚Äôs role is to ‚Äúfacilitate contacts between countries and institutions and creating conditions for partnerships, technical cooperation and resource mobilization at all levels‚Äù. The scope of the Mountain Partnership is for members to cooperate in order to facilitate, promote and implement initiatives at all levels. The Mountain Partnership‚Äôs main principles are ‚Äúparticipation of all members, accountability, responsiveness, consensus, transparency and flexibility‚Äù. Its Secretariat is crucial for the creation of an enabling environment for main actors to cooperate towards the obtainment of common aims. In 2012, its members lobbied for sustainable mountain development to be included in The Future We Want, the final outcome document of the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, resulting in the inclusion of three paragraphs relating to mountains. The partnership also encourages the development of policies and laws that give local mountain communities a voice in decision-making and organizes conferences, training sessions, workshops and communications materials on sustainable development in mountain areas worldwide. On 11-13 December 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization hosted the Fifth Global Meeting of the Mountain Partnership during which more than two hundred members participated. For this meeting, members renewed their commitments to protect mountains and their environments, to better the life of mountain peoples and to empower them. In addition, a four-year Governance and Strategy and two-year work plan were endorsed. Thanks to advocacy efforts of the Mountain Partnership members, mountains are mentioned in three targets under two of the 17 goals issued by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals in its outcome document. * By 2020 protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes * By 2020 ensure conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements * By 2030 ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, to enhance their capacity to provide benefits which are essential for sustainable development.

Oral legends relate that Gihanga introduced foundational elements of the African Great Lakes civilization, including fire, cattle, metalworking, hunting, woodworking and pottery.Herbert, p. 170 He is described as possessing talents in leadership, technology and religion. It is said he ruled Rwanda from his palace in the forest of Buhanga, an area that retained its forbidden and sacred status until the government opened it to the public in 2004.Auzias and Labourdette, p. 120 No concrete evidence exists to indicate that Gihanga lived,Adekunle, p. 50 although many Rwandans believe that he was a living king.Vansina, pp. 56-57 Legend tells that Gihanga was the product of the marriage of two lineages. His paternal great-great-grandfather was Kigwa (\\"Descended from Heavens\\"), said to have come down to Rwanda from the heavens to form the royal line, while his mother's side descended from an ancestor named Kabeja. His father, Kazi, was a blacksmith from whom Gihanga learned the art. Over the course of his childhood, he is said to have lived in several locations, including the eastern village of Mubari and his maternal uncles' village of Bugoyi in the northwest. Predominant colonial influenced oral accounts set the reign of Gihanga and the establishment of the Kingdom of Rwanda in the 11th century.Auzias and Labourdette, p. 38 According to Rwanda's oral history, several smaller clans may have existed during Gihanga's reign, including those of the Singa, Gesera, Zigaba and Rubanda clans.Ki-Zerbo, p. 207 According to legend, Gihanga was succeeded by a son named Kanyarwanda Gahima (a word signifying Rwanda itself),Vansina, p. 10 who is said to have unified Gatwa, Gahutu and Gatutsi, the ancestors of the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi castes respectively.Gatwa, p. 17 A religious practice arose in honor of Gihanga in the northwestern and northern parts of central Rwanda, and was many centuries later re-introduced to the royal court by Ruganzu Ndori, a remarkable historic king who further strengthened the Nyiginya Kingdom of Rwanda in the 16th century. Elements of the religion included the fire of Gihanga which was kept continually burning nonstop for centuries at the royal court at a site known as \\"the place where the cattle are milked\\", and was said to have been continually burning since Gihanga's reign. Gihanga's fire was extinguished at the end of the reign of Yuhi V Musinga in 1932 on the orders of the Belgian governors; The sending of tributes from the royal court to a site at Muganza in Rukoma said to be Gihanga's tomb; and royal court's keeping of a herd of cattle, said to be descended from Gihanga's own herd. These cattle were managed by the Heka family of the Zigaba clan, who lived near the tomb and provided the court with some of its most respected and powerful ritualists. Another family of ritualists, the Tega of the Singa clan, similarly drew their prestige from the fact that one of their ancestors, Nyabutege, had reportedly revealed the principle of the dynastic drum (Kalinga) to Gihanga.

The Papacy was hostile towards Bosnia due to the growing independence and strength of the Bosnian Church, labelled heretical by the Roman Catholic and Serbian Orthodox Church. Pope Innocent III sent a legate to Ban Kulin in 1203, receiving the Bosnian ruler's formal submission. In practice, nothing changed. Popes Honorius III and Gregory IX preached a war against Bosnia, culminating in the unsuccessful Bosnian Crusade in 1235. The relations between the Holy See and Bosnia eventually improved. Pope Pius II even sent a crown to be used at the coronation of King Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá in 1461. Two years later, however, the independent Kingdom of Bosnia was put to an end by the expanding Ottoman Empire. The Holy See recognized the independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1992, a month after the country's independence referendum. Beginning on 20 August 1992, the Holy See was among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, a multiconfessional country with three constituent peoples: the mostly Muslim Bosniaks, the mostly Orthodox Serbs and the mostly Catholic Croats.  Concordat  The signing of the concordat with Bosnia and Herzegovina was prevented in June 2007 by Serb members of the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who complained that the country's relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church should be regulated first. The Bosniak Deputy Chairman of the House of Peoples, Sulejman Tihiƒá, emphasized that the concordat would be an international convention unlike the agreement with the Serbian Orthodox Church, a religious community rather than a state, but his efforts to stress the importance of the country's international relations with the Holy See were ignored by the Serb members. The concordat was finally ratified by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 20 August 2007, recognizing the \\"public juridical personality of the BiH Catholic Church\\" and granting \\"a number of rights, including the recognition of Catholic holidays\\".  State visits  Izetbegoviƒá and Zubak greeting John Paul at the airport in April 1997 Pope John Paul II planned to visit Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the Bosnian War in 1994. The Bosnian Serb leaders, who besieged the city, said they would not guarantee his safety, and the visit was cancelled. Pope John Paul II paid a state visit in April 1997, following the end of the war. Momƒçilo Kraji≈°nik, the Serb member of the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, refused to welcome John Paul at Sarajevo International Airport on 12 April, saying that Orthodox Christians do not recognize popes. The Muslim member and Chairman of the Presidency, Alija Izetbegoviƒá, was there to welcome the Pope, however. The visit went ahead despite police discovering a cache of 23 land mines planted alongside the former Sniper Alley, through which John Paul was supposed to be driven; Izetbegoviƒá offered to accompany his guest along the route \\"as a gesture of solidarity against terrorist threats\\". On 14 April, the Pope met with all three members of the Presidency, including Kre≈°imir Zubak and Momƒçilo Kraji≈°nik, addressing them jointly before individual meetings with each. Members of the Presidency, namely Mirko ≈†aroviƒá, Sulejman Tihiƒá and Dragan ƒåoviƒá, paid a state visit to the Holy See on 21 March 2003, with the Serb Chairman ≈†aroviƒá inviting Pope John Paul II to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina once again. The Pope's subsequent visit to the now Serb Orthodox- dominated Bosnian city of Banja Luka, on 22 June, \\"was one of the coolest welcomes\\" he had ever received. Pope Francis celebrating a mass at the Ko≈°evo City Stadium in June 2015. The most recent papal visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina took place on 7 June 2015, when Pope Francis travelled to Sarajevo, continuing his trips to largely-Muslim countries. He met with members of the Presidency ‚Äì Chairman Mladen Ivaniƒá, Dragan ƒåoviƒá and Bakir Izetbegoviƒá ‚Äì at the presidential palace.

It can be described as a molecule of ethane () with one extra proton (hydrogen nucleus), that gives it a +1 electric charge. Ethanium is one of the simplest carbonium ions (after methanium ). It was first detected as a rarefied gas in 1960 by S. Wexler and N. Jesse. It easily dissociates into ethenium and molecular hydrogen . Production Ethanium was first detected by infrared spectroscopy among the ions produced by electrical discharges in rarefied methane or ethane gas. Ethanium can also be produced by irradiating methane containing traces of ethane with an electron beam at low pressure (about 2 mmHg). The electron beam first creates methanium and methenium ions. The former rapidly transfer their proton to ethane: : + ‚Üí + The latter reaction is also observed when , or ions are injected into ethane at somewhat lower pressure. Stability and reactions At about 1 mmHg and 30 ¬∞C, ethanium dissociates very slowly to ethenium and , across an energy barrier of about 10 kcal/mol; the decomposition is considerably faster at 92 ¬∞C. The decomposition has been claimed to be nearly athermal but with 8 kcal/mol of free energy due to increase of entropy. Structure Like its \\"unsaturated\\" relatives ethenium and ethynium , the ethanium ion was conjectured to have (at least momentarily) a proton bound simultaneously to the two carbon atoms, and the electrical charge evenly spread between them, as in other non-classical ions. The alternative \\"classical\\" structure would have the charge and the extra hydrogen bound to only one of the two atoms, i.e. a methylated methanium ion. Earlier calculations had predicted that the energies of the two forms should be 4 to 12 kcal/mol lower than the dissociated state + , and they should be separated by a slightly positive energy barrier. Gas- phase infrared spectroscopy by Yeh and others (1989) has shown that both forms are stable. The bridged structure has the lowest energy, 4 to 8 kcal/mol lower than the classical one. Refined calculations by Obata and Hirao (1993) predict that the most stable form has three orthogonal planes of symmetry (C2v) with the two subgroups in the eclipsed configuration (unlike ethane, whose ground state has the staggered configuration). Four \\"bottom\\" H atoms lie on a plane opposite to the bridging H atom and the other two \\"top\\" H atoms. The approximate computed distances are C‚ÄìC 0.211 nm, C‚ÄìH 0.124 nm (bridging), 0.107 nm (bottom) and 0.108 nm (top); the C‚ÄìH‚ÄìC angle at the bridge is about 116 degrees, the H‚ÄìC‚ÄìH angles are 116 degrees (bottom-bottom) and 114 degrees (bottom-top). However, there are other configurations with near-minimum energy, including one where the two subgroups are slightly staggered (with Cs symmetry), another where one of the carbons of a ion is loosely bound to an molecule 0.250 nm away.

A driveway alarm system is often integrated as a component of a system which automatically performs a task or alerts home owners of an unexpected intruder or visitor. Driveway alarms can be a vital component of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency, and other useful systems. Overview A driveway alarm always consists of two components, a sensor and receiver. The sensor is used to detect people or vehicles on the driveway and the receiver is the device which alerts the user or owner to this detection. Wireless driveway alarms consist of three components, the sensor, receiver and a transmitter which sends the wireless alert signal to the receiver. A driveway alarm may be connected to a burglar alarm that is used to alert the home owner or security service after it detects an intruder. Such a driveway may also trigger a security camera. Driveway alarms have found great application in domestic and commercial applications, especially in retail drive thru applications. Some of the more popular residential or commercial applications include motion- activated outdoor lighting systems, motion sensor street lamps and motion sensor lanterns. Sensors Three types of sensors are commonly used in driveway alarm systems: ;Passive infrared: Senses heat and motion. These sensors detect both vehicles and people but are prone to false alarms from animals. ;Magnetic probe: Uses a magnetic coil to detect moving metal nearby. Will only alarm when a vehicle moves by and are generally more costly than the passive infrared units. ;Rubber hose: When pressure is applied on top of the hose air is pushed up the hose triggering an alarm. Common in commercial applications. Wireless and wired systems Driveway alarms come in both wired and wireless packages. Infrared and rubber hose systems are generally sold as wireless units while magnetic probe systems are equally available as hard wired and wireless systems. Choosing between wireless or wired systems is typically decided by the environment the unit is being installed in. The most common driveway alarms sold are wireless infrared units.

The museum is dedicated for the history of Indonesian National Awakening. History=The building= The facade of the building in the 1920s. The building of the museum was constructed from 1899 to 1901. In March 1902, the building was officially opened under the name of STOVIA, the colonial medicine school for the Javanese and other native people. Students were obliged to live in the dorm until the completion of the 10 years study. Original layout of the school In 1920, because of the increasing number of students, studies were conducted in a new building (now the Medicine facility of the University of Indonesia). The building was then used as a MULO school (equivalent to junior high school), AMS (equivalent to senior high school) and school for pharmacist assistants. During the Japanese occupation, the building was used by the Japanese to contain the Dutch war prisoners. After the independence of Indonesia, the building was used as temporary residences for the KNIL and their families. =The museum= Due to the building relation with the birth of Budi Utomo on May 20, 1908, whose day are officially Day of National Awakening since 1948, the building was restored by the government of Jakarta on April 1973. The building was officially made a heritage building by then President Suharto on May 20, 1974 under the name of Gedung Kebangkitan Nasional (\\"The Building of National Awakening\\"). The previous occupants were moved to Cengkareng area. The building was initially made into four museums: Budi Utomo Museum, Museum of Women, Museum of Pers, and Museum of Health and Medicine. On February 7, 1984, the four museums were converged into the Museum of National Awakening. Collection The building collects 2,042 items related to the Indonesian National Awakening including original furniture of the school building, medical equipment, medical costumes, weapons, photographs, paintings, sculptures, dioramas, miniatures, sketches and maps.

It grows especially on outcrops, rocky hillsides and along cliffs fringing water courses and may rarely grow up to 10 m tall, and acquire a leafy spreading crown. Description The elliptic-oblong, leathery leaves of about 7 to 10 cm long, are carried on long petioles, and are often noticeably folded along the midrib. The leaf sides are almost parallel and clear net-veining is visible on the lamina. Leaves are brittle and have a characteristic smell when broken or bruised. The leaves are toxic and cause nervous disorders or even deaths in cattle. The small, smooth figs are carried on short stalks and measure about 4‚Äì6 mm in diameter. They are massed along the branchlets in the leaf axils, and change from white to yellowish-red and spotted as they ripen. The figs are eaten by birds and mammals. =Similar species= It may be confused with the similar but deciduous Ficus ingens which grows in similar habitat. The latter has somewhat larger, white to purple figs, and deep red fresh foliage. The Wonderboom fig is sometimes deemed a race of Ficus cordata, i.e. F. c. subsp. salicifolia (Vahl) C.C.Berg, though the latter species has yellowish sessile figs and a more westerly distribution. Distribution and habitat Trees of the Wonderboom grove It occurs in the Saharo-montane woodlands of the Tassili n'Ajjer, the Hoggar, A√Ør and Tibesti mountains, the Kerkour Nourene massif and at Elba mountain in the Red Sea Hills. It is widespread in the eastern Afrotropics, from southern Arabia and Socotra to the KwaZulu-Natal midlands of South Africa. The Wonderboom grove The species is named after the Wonderboom grove in Pretoria, that has spread from a central bole that was carbon dated to about 1,000 years old. The Wonderboom is an extraordinary specimen for its size and structure, and its drooping branches are continuing to root and form new trees. Their branches reach about 23 metres into the sky, and one of the boles has a girth of 5¬Ω metres. Ecology The pollinator wasp is Platyscapa awekei Wiebes., while non- pollinating wasps include Otitesella serrata Mayr and O. pseudoserrata van Noort.

It is an analog of fentanyl with around one quarter of its potency. One of the first mentions of this drug can be found in document written by The College on Problem of Drug Dependence, where it is mentioned as N-butyramide fentanyl analog.The College on Problem of Drug Dependence , Foreword to the Drug Evaluation Committee (DEC) Analgesic, Stimulant, and Depressant Drug Indices This document also states that the article describing its clinical effects (analgesic studies, Œº-, Œ¥-, Œ∫-opioid receptor binding, and in vitro measures of drug efficacy, antinociceptive, and narcotic properties) was published in 1987. It is an agonist for the Œº-opioid receptors.Utilization of a radioreceptor assay for the analysis of fentanyl analogs in urine Mario Enrique Alburges Butyrfentanyl has no current legitimate clinical applications; however, it is being sold as designer drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea, and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. Pharmacokinetics Butyrfentanyl binds to the opioid receptor. During the studies of in vitro inhibition of specific [3H] fentanyl binding to the opioid receptor, the order of analogues was: (¬±)-cis-3-methylfentanyl > fentanyl = alpha-methylfentanyl > butyrylfentanyl > benzylfentanyl. The studies in inhibition studies on binding affinity achieved the same order of analogues. It means that butyrfentantyl is a less potent opioid-agonist than fentanyl. On the other side, during in vitro studies of cross-reactivity with the fentanyl antibody between fentanyl and the fentanyl analogs examined, revealed order: fentanyl = butyrylfentanyl > (¬±)-cis-3-methylfentanyl > benzylfentanyl > alpha-methylfentanyl. High cross- reactivity may be the effect of the shape of the molecule - the shape of butyrfentanyl is closest to the original fentanyl molecule, which makes it easy to bind by fentanyl antibodies. The opioid receptor affinity of fentanyl and its analogs was determined from their inhibitory potency in a binding assay with [3H] fentanyl as the radioligand. The Ki value for butyrfentanyl was Ki=32 ¬± 4.1 nM. Comparing to fentanyl's Ki (Ki=1.06 ¬± 0.15 nM), butyrfentanyl's ability to displace [3H] fentanyl is low and it requires high concentrations of the drug.

He was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, a physician and a member of the Society of Friends (popularly known as Quakers), and originally wanted the college to promote the ideals of the Quaker religion and the advancement of women's education. In 1878 he paid $53,500 for forty acres in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. In 1879, Taylor had begun to give physical shape to his idea for a women's college. He was involved in the planning of the practical and conceptual aspects of the new institution, including the selection of a site, an architect, and a landscape designer. Among the practical considerations for the final site selection were the location's healthfulness and proximity to the railroad, Haverford College, and Philadelphia. The original campus, a small segment of the Thomas-Humphries Tract and part of a larger property deeded by William Penn to Edward Pritchard and Co. in 1682, comprised thirty-two acres between Merion, Roberts, Gulph and Yarrow roads. By 1893, the Board of Directors had expanded from the Quaker focus to make the college non-denominational.

Biography Having previously worked as a cashier at a cinema in Rome, 17-year-old Mariani was crowned Miss Italy of 1953 in the Tyrolean resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo. After winning the pageant she began her career as a film actress, playing herself in the opening segment of producer/director Alfredo Guarini's portmanteau film We, the Women (1953). Although in demand due to her beauty, she was eager to improve her acting skills, and attended both the Experimental Center of Cinematography and acting school. She began taking on challenging roles and working with artistically adventurous directors. Her most significant role was in director Luchino Visconti's 1954 film Senso, in which she worked alongside Alida Valli and Farley Granger, playing the small but important part of Clara, a young prostitute. Marcella Mariani in Senso (1954) Her promising career was prematurely ended by her death in a plane crash, which occurred on the slopes of Monte Terminillo, in the province of Rieti, Italy, as she returned from hosting a film festival in Belgium. Traveling from Brussels to Rome, the DC-6 passenger liner crashed due to errors made by the crew in poor weather conditions. Heavy wind and snow prevented searchers from reaching the crash site for over a week. All 29 passengers and crew were believed to have died on impact. Mariani, who had turned 19 a few days earlier, was taken to Rome, where she was buried.

Education Lemuel (Lem) Davis earned his master's degree in electrical engineering (M.S.E.E.) from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering (B.S.E.E.) from the University of South Alabama. Career Davis's career contributions are primarily in the field of computer animation systems. His career highlights include winning an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Scientific and Engineering Award in 1991 for his work at Walt Disney Studios with the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) team. CAPS was a significant advancement in the field of animation, as it was the first digital ink and paint system used in animated feature films. Michael Eisner later wrote, \\"This new technology, Lem argued, had the potential to revolutionize animated movies, both by creating efficiencies and by giving artists a new range of creative capacities that were the equivalent of moving from writing by hand to using a personal computer.\\" As a lead architect of the CAPS team, Davis worked as a technical director on Disney's first fully computer-animated short film, Oilspot and Lipstick. Davis is credited with the concept of the experimental film, in which two junkyard dogs fall in love and are menaced by a monster made of junk. It debuted at the 1987 SIGGRAPH Conference and was shown again in 1988 at the NCGA Video Showcase. As part of the CAPS team, Davis worked on The Little Mermaid (1989) and The Rescuers Down Under (1990). The CAPS system was in use until 2003. In 2000, Davis won the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers Journal Award along with Arjun Ramamurthy and Franz Herbert for their article, \\"Achieving Color Match Between Scanner, Monitor, and Film: A Color Management Implementation for Feature Animation.\\" During Davis's time at Disney, he contributed to the animated films The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Rescuers Down Under (1990) as Digital Production System Developer. At Warner Bros. Studios, Davis contributed to the animated films Balto (1995) as Director of Technology, Quest for Camelot (1998), The Iron Giant (1999) as Technology Supervisor, and Osmosis Jones (2001) as Technology Manager. He later worked for Laika, Inc. as they produced Coraline (2009). Davis currently lives in San Diego, California.

He left the full-time faculty (keeping a voluntary faculty appointment as Associate Clinical Professor in the Departments of Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery) in January 2018 to found his new practice, Jenkins NeuroSpine. He continues his research, and clinical activities with the NY Jets, the NYPD, and the Retired Players Program of the NFL. Neurotect, LLC. He started a company, called Neurotect LLC to develop the technology for prevention of spinal or orthopedic injuries, or to facilitate the extraction of accident victims trapped in a vehicle. This company is working with his team and other collaborators to bring these safety devices to the market, with an eye on reducing the need for, or severity of, neurosurgical treatment for these accident victims. Academic Research Dr. Jenkins conducts his research at the Icahn School of Medicine and it is related to neurosurgery and spinal surgery. His clinical research focuses on developing new techniques to treat various conditions, managing post-operative pain, developing or advancing procedures that preserve motion, and stem cell injections for spinal cord injuries. His scientific research focuses on treatments for spinal cord injury-acute and delayed intervention. This includes surgical techniques to restore function lost below the level of injury. His current research includes minimally invasive surgery for metastatic disease to the spinal bones, assessment of mobility recovery after spinal surgery using wireless technology, a prospective study for minimally invasive surgery for spine metastases, spine surgery outcomes research, mindfulness meditation for spine surgery pain, and InVivo‚Äôs clinical study of its investigational Neuro-Spinal Scaffold in patients with acute spinal cord injury. He has published and presented nationally and internationally on the subjects of spinal cord injury, spinal tumors, and minimally invasive spinal surgery as well as on general spinal surgical outcomes. He is a member of multiple research groups, but is known for his work in three main areas in addition to general outcomes research: *Spinal Tumors: Dr. Jenkins pioneered a new and minimally invasive way of performing spinal tumor surgery one that reduces the risks and increases the benefits when compared to open standard surgical treatments for tumors of the spine. Dr. Jenkins developed, with the Radiation Oncologist Dr. Jamie Cesaretti, an implantable device to protect the spinal cord from damage from radiation therapy given to patients with spinal tumors. This device would allow for higher doses of radiation to the tumor while protecting the spinal cord. *Spinal Cord Injury: Dr. Jenkins is the director of the Mount Sinai Neurosurgery Spinal Cord Injury Laboratory, and in that capacity is also collaborating with Dr. Avraham Dilmanian of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stonybrook University in developing novel treatments for spinal cord injury(ref Dilmanian articles). Dr. Jenkins is currently the Principal Investigator at Mount Sinai for the InVivo clinical trial for Complete Traumatic Acute Spinal Cord Injury as well as the principal surgeon for the StemCellsInc clinical trial for Stem Cell Transplantation in Cervical Spinal Cord Injury. He was honored by the Alan T.

The painting depicts an injured soldier of the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War (1861 to 1865) waiving an improvised flag of surrender.Silkenat, David. Raising the White Flag: How Surrender Defined the American Civil War. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2019. The soldier is accompanied by black man and a woman holding an infant: the black man is presumed to be the soldier's slave, and the woman and infant are presumed to be his wife and child. Imagery and interpretation Smithsonian curator Eleanor Jones Harvey included Surrender of a Confederate Soldier in her 2012 exhibition The Civil War and American Art. In her catalog for the exhibition, Harvey asserts that the painting is part of a genre of images, painted in the Union states of the North, that showed the dignified surrender of the Southern soldiers as a way of depicting the emotional trauma of their defeat, the uncertainty of their social and economic future, and the possibility of a peaceful long-term reconciliation between the North and South. The artist served in the Union army and was a Medal of Honor recipient.

OSCAR 3) is the third amateur radio satellite launched by Project OSCAR into Low Earth Orbit. OSCAR 3 was launched March 9, 1965 by a Thor-DM21 Agena D launcher from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Lompoc, California. The satellite, weighing 16.3 kg, was launched piggyback with seven United States Air Force satellites. The satellite employed no attitude control system. OSCAR III linear transponder lasted 18 days. More than 1000 amateurs in 22 countries communicated through the linear transponder. The two beacon transmitters continued operating for several months. Project OSCAR Project OSCAR Inc. started in 1960 with radio amateurs from the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California, many of whom worked at TRW and defense industries, to investigate the possibility of putting an amateur satellite in orbit. Project OSCAR was responsible for the construction of the first Amateur Radio Satellite, OSCAR-1, that was successfully launched from Vandenberg AFB in California. OSCAR-1 orbited the earth for 22 days, transmitting a ‚ÄúHI‚Äù greeting in Morse Code. Project OSCAR was responsible for launching 3 other amateur radio satellites during the 1960s: OSCAR 1, OSCAR 2, and OSCAR 4 In 1969, AMSAT-NA was founded by radio amateurs working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and in the Baltimore-Washington DC region, to continue the efforts begun by Project OSCAR. Its first project was to coordinate the launch of Australis-OSCAR 5, constructed by students at the University of Melbourne. Today, over fifty years later, Project OSCAR still exists as part of the San Jose (CA) Amateur Radio Club. Its mission is ‚ÄúTo initiate and support activities that promote the Satellite Amateur Radio Hobby‚Äù. The primary goal is to reach out and provide logistical support, training and in some cases equipment to amateur radio associations, schools and the public at large. Firsts Oscar III was an upgrade from the earlier Oscar I and Oscar II amateur satellites, three years earlier. Improvements included: * Oscar 3 was the first true amateur satellite relaying voice contacts in the VHF 2 meter band through a 1 W 50 kHz wide linear transponder (146 MHz uplink and 144 MHz downlink). * First amateur satellite to operate from solar power and relay signals from Earth. * First usage of beacon transmitters, separate from the main communications system (linear transponder). * Early Bird, also known as Intelsat I, the world's first commercial communications satellite, would be launched 28 days later.

The book is named after his hometown of Palo Alto, California, and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, the stories describe life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who spend most of their time indulging in driving drunk, using drugs and taking part in unplanned acts of violence.

History  Allen Eaves (MD, PhD, FRCPC), a hematologist and cancer researcher, co- founded the Terry Fox Laboratories (TFL) in Vancouver with his wife, Connie Eaves, in 1981. Unsatisfied with commercially available cell culture reagents, Allen Eaves‚Äô research group at the TFL began making their own media for culturing hematopoietic stem cells. Eaves eventually began to sell the media to other research groups around the world. Production ultimately warranted building a designated clean room, which the TFL did not have the funding to provide. Instead, Eaves purchased the business from the TFL, creating an independent company with a loan from Western Economic Diversification and a mortgage on his house. STEMCELL Technologies Inc. was launched on July 2, 1993.http://www.eurostemcell.org/commentanalysis/meet-allen-eaves-academic- biologist-turned-ceo In its first year, STEMCELL employed eight people and, selling only cell culture media for growing hematopoietic stem cells, generated $1 million in sales. The company has since seen steady annual growth. STEMCELL has gradually expanded their product portfolio to include immune cell isolation tools as well as products that support research using pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. The company also sells tissue-specific products for use in neural, mammary, prostate, pulmonary, pancreatic, and intestinal cell lineages. STEMCELL's bioengineering division develops labware and instruments and offers custom assay services.

It was an expansion determined mostly by trial and error, represented mostly by new tactics, new procedures, and new technology, though rarely by specialized aircraft types. The mission type branched out into many sub-types, including new electronic forms of reconnaissance. In sharp contrast with the case during the pre-war years, by 1945 air reconnaissance was widely recognized as a vital, indispensable component of air power. Pre-war situation In the interwar years, reconnaissance languished as a mission type and tended to be overshadowed by routine aerial mapping. This was despite the growth (in the United States and Britain) of a doctrine of strategic bombardment as the decisive weapon of war. Experience would soon prove that bombing was completely ineffective unless accompanied by intensive aerial reconnaissance. In the 1930s, gradual technical progress in the leading air nations led to advances particularly in photogrammetry and cartography, but failed to be translated into a capable operational reconnaissance capability. The various parties went into the new war with mostly the same cameras and procedures they had used when exiting the last one. Stereoscopic imaging using overlapping exposures was refined and standardized for mapping.Babington Smith, 78; Stanley, 268 et passim Color photography from the air was introduced in 1935 in the United States, but did not find widespread application.Goddard, 240 Experiments with flash bomb photography at night were carried out pre-war, but did not lead to an operational capability until later in the war.Goddard, 127‚Äì131 e.a. In the United States, apart from the case of small army-cooperation observation planes, the emphasis was almost completely on aerial mapping conducted by long-range bombers. In Germany, the Army Chief, Werner Freiherr von Fritsch, noted that in the next war, whoever had the best air reconnaissance would win ‚Äì and thereby won himself a perfunctory mention in almost all subsequent works on the topic.Babington Smith, 6 Yet in all countries, initial doctrines were focused on battlefield observation, which assumed a relatively static front, as it had been in the previous war.Kreis, 81, e.a. Strategic reconnaissance in its embryonic form began with the flights carried out over Germany by Australian businessman Sidney Cotton just before the outbreak of war in Europe. On behalf of first French and then British intelligence, Cotton outfitted civilian Lockheed Electras with hidden cameras and was able to snap useful footage during business trips. Cotton pioneered (for the British) the trimetrogon mount and the important innovation of heated cameras, fogging being the bane of high-altitude photography.Leaf, 14‚Äì38 However, a multi-lens trimetrogon had been used in the 1919 U.S. Bagley mapping camera, and Germany had heated optics during the Great War.Goddard, 25 Early Western reconnaissance Sidney Cotton's work found only grudging approval with the Royal Air Force, but eventually his work was incorporated into No. 1 Photographic Development Unit (PDU) at RAF Heston and then RAF Benson, a unit from which most later British air reconnaissance developed. (It soon was renamed 1 PRU, R for reconnaissance.)Leaf, 18 Key to the RAF's intellectual ascendancy in reconnaissance was the establishment of the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) at RAF Medmenham. Priority tasks of this unit were to prepare target folders and to chart Axis air defenses. In short order, it began to evaluate the effectiveness of bombing.Ehlers See Photo interpretation. At first Britain used a handful of hastily modified Spitfires (PR 1) and some medium twins (Bristol Blenheims) for photographic reconnaissance, supplemented by in-action footage shot from regular bombing aircraft. At this time the RAF still used the vintage F8 and F24 cameras, later adding the larger F52. The F24 became especially useful in night photography.Stanley, Staerck Thanks to bomb damage assessment (BDA) the complete failure of precision daylight bombing soon became apparent, the vast majority of bombers not even coming close to their targets. This resulted in heavier demands on reconnaissance for before-and-after photography; and the documented poor results (as well as heavy losses) led to a shift to night-time area bombing.Ehlers Britain was far behind Germany in optics, and at one time 1 PRU took two Zeiss Ikon cameras with 60 cm lenses from a lost Ju 88 and used them for high-altitude photography.Leaf, 48 By 1941, the RAF had a capable reconnaissance arm (1 PRU) centered at RAF Benson, supported by a nascent infrastructure in interpretation and analysis. The Combined/Joint Intelligence Committee (CIC) ensured centralized tasking for critical objectives. The RAF led this field by far, and in 1941 several American observers from both the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) and the U.S. Navy were sent to England to investigate RAF reconnaissance methods.Goddard. See also Arnold, Henry: Global Mission. General Arnold was one of the fact-finders in Britain in spring 1941. Unlike the case in the previous war, French reconnaissance was now comparatively ineffective on all levels, and entirely lacked a strategic perspective. Most aircraft allocated to the mission type were obsolete. Large numbers of open-cockpit Mureaux 115/117 and light twin Potez 630 series were assigned to Army cooperation according to observation doctrines from the previous war. However, the new and scarce Bloch 174 twin distinguished itself by its high performance. Noted writer and reconnaissance pilot Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry flew this aircraft before the fall of France.St. Exupery: Flight to Arras, 1942. Italian reconnaissance over Ethiopia 1936 high-oblique Italian reconnaissance photo over Qortem Zer'a in Tigray Region, Ethiopia The Istituto Geografico Militare acquired aerial photographs to sustain its war effort against Ethiopia in the mid 1930s. The aerial photographs over Ethiopia in 1935-1941 consist of 8281 assemblages on hardboard tiles, each holding a label, one nadir-pointing photograph flanked by two low-oblique photographs and one high-oblique photograph. The four photos were exposed simultaneously and were taken across the flight line. A high-oblique photograph is presented alternatively at left and at right. There is approx. 60% overlap between subsequent sets of APs. One of Ermenegildo Santoni‚Äôs glass plate multi-cameras was used, with focal length of 178 mm and with a flight height of 4000-4500 metres above sea level, which resulted in an approximate scale of 1:11,500 for the central photograph and 1:16,000 to 1:18,000 for the low-oblique photos. The surveyors oriented themselves with maps of Ethiopia at 1:400,000 scale, compiled in 1934. The flights present a dense coverage of Northern Ethiopia, where they were acquired in the context of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Several flights preceded the later advance of the Italian army southwards to the capital Addis Ababa. As of 1936, the aerial photographs were used to prepare topographic maps at 1:100,000 and 1:50,000 scales.Recovery of the aerial photographs of Ethiopia in the 1930sIGM, L‚ÄôIstituto Geografico Militare in Africa Orientale, 1885 - 1937, Istituto Geografico Militare, Roma, 1939 German reconnaissance capabilities Ju 88A over France, 1942 Despite a considerable technological and numerical head start, Germany gradually neglected aerial reconnaissance, at least relative to Britain. The reason, grounded in history and geography, was that Germany had no strategic bombing doctrine and viewed air power as an auxiliary of land armies. Numerous Aufkl√§rungs (up-clearing, i.e. reconnaissance) units were established for marine and ground support purposes, but while this was effective in the tactical sense, the intellectual investment in interpretation, analysis, and strategic estimation lagged. From the German perspective, this was defensible considering that about 90% of the action lay in large land-battles in the East, and an expensive long-range air capability would have been unlikely to effectively change the outcome.Hooton Leading up to the war, the United States developed an indigenous high-quality optics capability led by Bausch & Lomb of Rochester, N.Y.; however this company had been allied to Germany's Zeiss-Jena. Nonetheless, the American reconnaissance expert, then-captain George William Goddard, said that he much coveted German technical leadership, specifically as represented by Carl Zeiss Jena optical works, and he was pleased to briefly occupy that facility at the end of the war. But the German Air Force, expecting a quick victory, did not build an integrated reconnaissance and interpretation capability as a core national security asset like the Anglo Allies did.Goddard, 340-41 Blohm & Voss BV 141 Before 22 June 1941, German reconnaissance was far predominant in frequency with many daily sorties throughout the region. Leading up to the invasion of France, concentration was on ports, forts, railways and airports, using mostly Do 17Ps and He 111Hs, already vulnerable types, and rapid conversion to Ju 88D, later Ju 88H followed. Losses were on the order of 5‚Äì10%. A regular daily weather reconnaissance was kept up over the North Sea. Maritime reconnaissance from France and Norway reached well west of Ireland to the coast of Greenland using Focke Wulf Fw 200 and various multi-engine seaplanes.Hooton,197‚Äì201 Germany used the LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin airship for sigint sorties targeting RAF radar stations in 1939. German units were divided into Fernaufkl√§rer (long- distance), Nahaufkl√§rer (tactical, subordinate to Army command), Nachtaufkl√§rer (night photography), and maritime and special units. Command structure and unit designations changed incessantly. Each staffel (squadron, roughly) had a Bildgruppe of interpreters, who would telephone urgent intelligence to nearby headquarters. Film and analyses would go to Fliegerkorps (higher-level) staff later; eventually top-level staff at Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) headquarters at Zossen near Berlin would receive the products for filing and possibly strategic integration.Hooton, 199; Babington Smith A Ju 86P high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, with Jumo 207 turbocharged diesel powerplants. Germany emphasized tactical reconnaissance and invested considerably in both modified aircraft ‚Äì primarily Ju 88s and Ju 188s ‚Äì and in dedicated types such as the asymmetric Blohm & Voss BV 141 (20 built) and the twin-boom Fw 189 Uhu (nearly 900 produced). This Nahaufkl√§rung was primarily successful on the Eastern Front where immediate results were desired, and these units were directly under Army field command. For special demanding tasks a high-altitude photographic reconnaissance aircraft, the pressurized Ju 86P was available in very small numbers, but it could not survive after 1943. Also pressurized, the Ju 388L could reach 45,000 feet and much higher airspeeds than the Ju 86P but only 50 examples were built late in the war and few saw operational service. Fighters, often with dual oblique cameras in the rear fuselage, were pressed into service for reconnaissance where their speed was necessary, and performed well in this role. Overall, however German reconnaissance against well-defended England was relatively ineffective.Stanley Prior to Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the USSR, the German Air Force did carry out an extensive pre-strike aerial observation of European Russia. This was possible partly because Soviet air opposition was weak, and because of the Soviet leadership's conviction that Germany would not attack. The Luftwaffe maintained air superiority in the East until late in the war, but simply could not bring enough resources to bear for air power to be decisive.Hooton Axis partners, Italy and Japan, successfully performed long-distance reconnaissance prior to meeting stiffening opposition in 1942. Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the Philippines prior to 7 December 1941.Stanley Other countries A damaged and abandoned Po-2 forced to land in Ukraine, and subsequently captured by German troops, 1941. The Soviet Union had no advanced reconnaissance resources, but emphasized visual observation and reporting over the battle space. Open- cockpit biplanes such as the Po-2 were very useful for this, especially at night. The Soviets had virtually no interest in long-range air power or strategic reconnaissance, and had no advanced optics capabilities. However, they learned a lot about the discipline from the Americans when the U.S. Army Air Forces operated from three Ukrainian bases in 1944 (Operation Frantic). This operation included a photo-reconnaissance detachment which shared all results with the USSR. At the same time, Americans learned that Soviet photoreconnaissance capabilities were embryonic.Hansen, 354‚Äì387 Japanese reconnaissance was characterized by institutional rivalry between the Army and the Navy. The latter standardized on the Yokosuka Suisei (Judy) and Nakajima C6N (Myrt) multi-seat aircraft. The Army, which encountered little air opposition in China, used a variety of aircraft types and cameras. Italy entered the war in 1940 with a very large number of obsolete observation aircraft, mostly open-cockpit biplanes assigned directly to Army commands. Initially, some strategic surveillance was carried out by three-engined bombers, and Italian aircraft ranged from Nigeria to Abyssinia to Bahrein (one flew to Japan and back). Italian reconnaissance could not survive in contested airspace. Neutral countries seemingly remained in the World War I mindset of trench observation. While aerial photography was allocated to tactically inferior aircraft, and aerial mapping advanced considerably, there was no concept of strategic reconnaissance and little thought given to analysis and interpretation. Surprisingly, this was even the case in the United States, where the Air Corps had staked its future on the doctrine of strategic bombing. Up to 1940, the USAAC‚Äôs interest in reconnaissance was centered in one small office at Wright Field, Ohio, headed by the controversial Captain George William Goddard. He was responsible for most of the technical advantages adopted by the USAAC during the early war years. The extensive O-series of aircraft, such as the Douglas O-38 and its descendants, were typically low and slow and used for direct Army liaison, artillery spotting, and observation. The OA series of observation amphibians were mostly Army variants of better known Navy types, such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina. These were in practice more utility aircraft than dedicated reconnaissance platforms. In December 1941, complacency and inadequate leadership led to the failure to detect the Japanese task force north of Hawaii from the air.numerous investigations of Pearl Harbor reached this conclusion, which is still preferred to alternative theories. Also, the Americans labored under the handicap that much equipment was assigned to Britain as fast as it could be produced. American contribution By 1941, prompted by the British experience, Americans began to understand the need for a much expanded air reconnaissance concept. The F-series, which denoted photographic reconnaissance, was then led by the F-3A, a modified A-20 Havoc. Thanks in large part to the advocacy of the Director of Photographic Intelligence, the also very controversial Colonel Minton Kaye, a run of 100 Lockheed P-38s were set aside for modification to F-4 standard, incorporating the trigonometric mount that both Kaye and Cotton had pioneered prior to the war. Despite the promising performance of the F-4, there were so many technical problems with the early versions that the model was largely rejected by its crews when it did reach combat zones. The RAF rejected the P-38, as well.Goddard, 297, 299 The first U.S. operational reconnaissance experience was gained in the Australian theater. The top name to emerge was that of Colonel Karl Polifka, an extremely aggressive pilot who developed many of the tactics that would later become standard. Operating from Port Moresby to Rabaul, his F-4-equipped 8th PR squadron encountered serious problems reducing it at one time to one aircraft, but the valuable experience gained was shared by Polifka when he returned to the U.S. in 1943.Hansen, 275-7 When the United States and Britain invaded French North Africa in November 1942, the hastily improvised reconnaissance capability was quickly checked by reality. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, led the American reconnaissance assets and in February joined with RAF units in the multinational Northwest African Photographic Reconnaissance Wing (NAPRW). At that point the Wing had found the F-4 unsatisfactory, the F-9 or B-17 Fortress unable to survive over enemy territory, and the new British de Havilland Mosquito to be the most promising reconnaissance platform. British squadrons in the Mediterranean took over the slack left by the Americans. Numerous other technical and tactical problems virtually brought American reconnaissance to a halt; but it rebounded swiftly, and by the time of the invasion of Sicily in July (Operation Husky), a very credible joint capability existed, the NAPRW comprising South African, Free French, and New Zealand units as well as RAF and USAAC units. By that time, new F-5 models of the Lightning were becoming available, and they were found to be far more reliable and capable. However, this period marked the beginning of a year-long struggle by the USAAF, led especially by Colonel Roosevelt, to acquire the Mosquito and to also develop a brand new reconnaissance aircraft ‚Äì a quest that would result in the ill-fated and scandal-ridden Hughes XF-11.Hansen The RAF continued to display leadership in the field, and now took on the role of on-the-job mentor to the Americans. Spitfires and Mosquitos were found to be the best reconnaissance platforms, as everyone now realized that speed, range, and altitude were essential to survival and good photographs. Second-line photographic aircraft (such as Bostons, Blenheims, Marylands) were relegated to less contested skies. The RAF turned Medmenham into the Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU), inviting the Americans to participate on a joint basis, and continued to spin off new squadrons with high-performance reconnaissance aircraft based both in the British Isles and in the Mediterranean. Other RAF units operated in the Far East, often with slightly less capable aircraft such as Hawker Hurricanes and B-25 Mitchells. A very large fraction of RAF reconnaissance was consumed in tracking German capital ships. This endeavor even included stationing photo detachments at Vaenga air field on the Kola Peninsula. When the British returned home, their reconnaissance aircraft were given to the Soviets.Leaf During this period Wing Commander Adrian Warburton built a reputation as a daring and productive reconnaissance pilot; and Wing Commander D. W. Steventon undertook many important missions, inc. some of the first overflights of the German experimental site of Peenemunde on the Baltic coast.Leaf, 99‚Äì103 The interpreters at ACIU gained recognition for their expertise, F/O Constance Babington Smith, MBE and Sarah (Churchill) Oliver being among the noted names.Babington Smith A scientific approach to reconnaissance developed, topped by the involvement of the Prime Minister when particularly notable results were discussed, such as the discovery of German jet fighters in test. The RAF also early developed the standard three-phase interpretation procedure: first phase required immediate response (such as advancing columns of armor sighted); second phase required 24- hour handling (such as concentrations of landing crafts in ports); and third phase was for long-term analysis (such as industrial targets like coal gasification plants). Also, the distinction between strategic and tactical reconnaissance became clear, and sub-specialties like weather reconnaissance, radar photography, and bomb- damage assessment (BDA) became current. Both sides developed programs of regular weather reconnaissance in the Atlantic. In addition, the technique widely known as ‚Äúdicing‚Äù ‚Äì extreme low-altitude photography at high speed ‚Äì came to be adopted by the Allies for special work.Hansen, 280‚Äì281 Colonel Roosevelt pioneered night photography over Sicily. Flash bombs had to set off at very precise timing in order to capture the image, and in time the Edgerton D-2 Flash System came into wide use, this involving capacitor discharge at precise intervals.Goddard, 329‚Äì330 Also, infrared film began to be used at the end of the war.Goddard, 236 It was generally agreed that the Mosquito, designated F-8 by the Americans, was the best platform ‚Äì apart from its performance, it offered the use of another operator in the glazed nose, which made both navigation and the very delicate selection of camera controls to match speed and altitude easier than in the single-seat F-5 Lightnings. Nonetheless, the Americans began to standardize on F-5s and F-6 Mustangs in order to promote an indigenous capability and break away from the RAF's tutelage.Keen, Kreis Endgame 325th Reconnaissance Wing yearbook cover, published in 1945. By D-day, the U.S. 8th and 9th Air Forces had an immense reconnaissance wing in Colonel Roosevelt's 325th Reconnaissance Wing. It commanded two groups, the 25th Bombardment Group at RAF Watton and the 7th PRG at RAF Mount Farm (other units supported tactical reconnaissance for the 9th Air Force). The seven squadrons of the 325th provided routine weather recon, pathfinder-services, BDA, chaff and other electronic services, radar photography and night missions, as well as special operations in support of inserted agents. In Italy, the Mediterranean Allied Photographic Reconnaissance Wing under Colonel Polifka provided similar services, and using staging bases in the Ukraine these units together could provide full, regular coverage of the shrinking Axis territory. The RAF maintained a similar large number of reconnaissance squadrons, dominated by Spitfires and Mosquitos; however, in the Far East and the Middle East, less capable types tended to be allocated to reconnaissance and army cooperation. For example, in Iraq during the 1941 Nazi coup, the RAF relied on Hawker Audax biplanes. What had begun with one PRU in 1940 eventually amounted to several dozen squadrons worldwide. Because of a singular devotion to victory through strategic bombing, the USAAF placed extraordinary emphasis on reconnaissance. As an example, the need to destroy German petroleum, oil and lubricants facilities required careful monitoring to decide not only what to hit, but when and how much ‚Äì and then when to hit them again. This led to an emphasis on long-term surveillance, and also to centralized analysis correlating photography with other sources (such as agents on the ground). Although the RAF usually preferred area bombing, it promoted a similar reconnaissance emphasis, for example in the celebrated discovery, coverage, and analysis of the Peenemunde rocket range which culminated in an important August 1943 raid. The Axis had no comparable strategic capability and most Axis air resources were consumed in support of massive ground battles. In general, Western reconnaissance aircraft were unarmed, not only to maximize performance, but to emphasize the objective of bringing back pictures, not engaging the enemy. They also usually flew singly or in widely spread pairs. In special circumstances it was necessary to bring along fighter escorts; this phenomenon arose again in the last months when the hitherto sovereign Mosquito began to be picked off by Me 262 jets. Selected heavy bombers carried film cameras and cameramen. The 8th Air Force‚Äôs 8th Combat Camera Unit thus documented much of the air war, and these films are much more frequently shown today than are the static images of regular reconnaissance. D-Day constituted the single biggest photo-recon job in history. One who was there reported that at the ACIU, 1,700 officers and enlistees studied 85,000 images daily. There were 12,000 Allied aircraft in the air over the region that day.Brugioni, 23‚Äì26 If the invasion was counted as a major reconnaissance success, the Ardennes offensive (known in America as the Battle of the Bulge) in December was a major failure. Post-battle investigation maintained that the problem lay not in obtaining airborne evidence, but in integrating the numerous disparate data points into a coherent picture. Also, by then the Germans had learned to move by night and under cover of seasonal bad weather when possible. These countermeasures, also including going underground and exploiting snow cover, came to represent some of the limitations of overhead reconnaissance even in conditions of overwhelming air superiority.Babington Smith, 255‚Äì257 German reconnaissance languished in the west because radar-aided air defenses there made survival unlikely. Apart from the ubiquitous Ju 88s, the Heinkel He 177s proved valuable as a reconnaissance platform but that type was extremely troubled mechanically. In effect, the Luftwaffe was unable to carry out regular surveillance of critical targets like the British Isles prior to the invasion of June 1944; indeed, one German aircraft was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to overfly Dover in order to report on a fake invasion build-up there.Goddard, 331 (However, Brugioni maintains that Germany did conduct sufficient flights to estimate the time and place of the invasion.)Brugioni After this, a few jets became available: Arado Ar 234 allocated to Sonderkommandos, but although they were uninterceptable the results brought back seems to have added little value to the German war effort. A version of the very advanced Dornier Do 335 was assigned to recon duties. Reconnaissance was more successful in the East, and the Germans did carry out large-scale photographic mapping, some of which would later benefit the western Allies. The Luftwaffe also successfully deployed night photography with flash bombs, as amply documented by the BDA of the annihilating German attack on the USAAF in the Ukrainian SSR in June 1944.Hansen, 372‚Äì375 At sea, Germany had a considerable early lead in long- range aircraft, chiefly represented by the Fw 200 Condor. This was a converted airliner unsuitable for the rigors of combat. As a Fernaufkl√§rer, the large Ju 290 had the necessary range, but it was produced in low numbers and was very vulnerable. Seeaufkl√§rer and Kustenflieger groups used seaplanes of many different types with considerable success in coastal areas, especially from Norway. By 1942‚Äì43 the Condor menace was subsiding, and German long-range aircraft had great difficulty surviving in the Atlantic. They were much more effective in Northern Norway against the Arctic convoys. Germany adopted armed reconnaissance as an expediency at these long ranges.Hooton Finally, the industrial centers arrayed against the Axis ‚Äì in the United States and the Urals and Siberia ‚Äì were simply out of reach of strategic reconnaissance. As always it was at the tactical level that the Germans excelled, and short-range aircraft were able to hold their own in the East until fuel, pilots, and even aircraft became depleted. Experts generally hold that the top German leadership failed to understand air power, and Hitler has been especially blamed for lacking the strategic perspective that the West Allies adopted.Hooton But since the industrial mismatch was insurmountable, it is doubtful what difference a greater German emphasis on strategic reconnaissance and commensurate bombardment would have made. The Allies were slow to allocate very long ranged aircraft to maritime duties. They needed long-range maritime surveillance to hunt submarines just as the Luftwaffe needed it to hunt convoys. Stung by catastrophic losses, in April 1943 the United States finally allocated sufficient numbers of VLR (very long range) aircraft to suppress submarines. This was an important factor in defeating the U-boat offensive that spring. Maritime versions of the B-24 served effectively in this maritime patrol role.The USAAF in World War II (official history) The Soviet Union had virtually no in-depth reconnaissance capability and relied overwhelmingly on human intelligence (humint). By the time of the brief U.S.-Soviet shuttle bombing program in the summer of 1944, the Americans noted that Soviet reconnaissance did not venture far past the front, and that photographic technology was far inferior. At Poltava, the U.S. reconnaissance detachment shared all imagery as well as tactics and technology with their Soviet counterparts, enabling the latter to comprehend American operations and develop an indigenous capability. Besides, for strategic intelligence the Soviets had thoroughly infiltrated both Allied and Axis governments at the most sensitive levels.Hansen, 366‚Äì370; Stanley, 186 In the Pacific, long range was at a premium, and both fleet and army aircraft soon reflected an overwhelming American advantage. The U.S. Navy, prompted by the intelligence failure at Pearl Harbor, invested in long-range patrol aircraft like the ubiquitous PBY Catalina. However, from early on the Allies had a tremendous unseen advantage in signals intelligence and cryptography, being able to read Axis codes. This led to economies in reconnaissance. Perhaps surprising considering her small industrial base, Japan may have built the finest and most beautiful reconnaissance aircraft of the war. These included several superb platforms such as ‚Äúthe Japanese Mosquito‚Äù, the unarmed Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\"; and the extreme-long-range Kawanishi H8K \\"Emily\\", widely considered the best flying boat of the war. These aircraft reached as far as Ceylon. The Navy's standard Nakajima C6N \\"Myrt\\" was also an extremely capable reconnaissance platform from 1944 on. But it does not appear that Japan had the overall industrial capability nor made the intellectual investment necessary to run a competitive reconnaissance branch. From 1943, the Japanese were virtually always on the defensive, while new long-range, high-altitude U.S. aircraft climaxing with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress (F-13 in the reconnaissance role) provided overwhelming American coverage of the Home Islands from mid-1944. Cameras Aircraft usually carried several different camera configurations in one bay. A common installation was the trimetrogon: one vertical, and one oblique to each side. Often one aircraft carried several different camera-lens configurations for special purposes. The British found that a rearwards-facing camera could overcome some of the jitter from sideways movement, and that very low-level photography (called dicing) benefitted from an almost side-ways camera view. Most surveillance was conducted from extremely high altitudes, requiring long-focus optics, as reflected in ‚ÄúGoddard‚Äôs Law‚Äù: In photo-reconnaissance there is no substitute for focal length.Goddard; Stanley In the United States, the primary aerial cameras were the K-series and naval F-series produced by Fairchild. Inventor Sherman Fairchild had developed the K-3 in 1919 based on experience from the Great War. His work would dominate the field for decades, including in the form of foreign copies. Initially many cameras still used German Zeiss and Schneider optics. The U.S. K-17 (9x9 inch image) with several different lenses was especially ubiquitous. For mapping, a six-inch lens was standard. The less common K-18 (9x18) was used for high altitude. K-19s were used at night, and the small K-20s (4x5) for low-level obliques. Although standardized on 9X9 inch plates, several similar camera types came into use. The period saw a rapid development of longer focal lengths in order to enable high-resolution high-altitude photography. 12, 24, 36 and ultimately 60-inch lenses came into use. The Americans also produced and used British cameras (F24 as K24). The old James Bagley T-1 mapping camera and its multi-lens descendants were still used strictly for aerial mapping. The Navy used variants of the Fairchild series.Stanley In Britain, the small F24 (5x5 image) and the derivative but much larger F52 (8.5x7) aerial cameras dominated, the former being used mostly for night photography with the aid of flash bombs. Up to 40-inch lenses were fitted. These cameras had shutter-in-focal-plane, whereas U.S. cameras standardized on shutter-between-lenses, claiming this reduced distortion.Staerck, 12‚Äì14 Exposures typically required the use of a cockpit- mounted intervalometer, set by reference to speed, altitude, and interval so that the pilot or observer could obtain the correct exposures by keying a switch. Great flight precision was needed especially for exposures for stereography and cartography in general. While German optics were superior, experts noted that standard German reconnaissance cameras, though excellent, were heavy and not optimized for aerial use. Leica seemed to be the main camera manufacturer while optics production was concentrated at ISCO G√∂ttingen (Schneider) and Zeiss. The bulky Rb30 (Reihenbild) and its variants were in common use. This required at least two men for handling and produced 12x12 (32 cm) images. It was supplemented by smaller hand-held cameras, Hk13 (Handkamera) and Hk19, which also could be fitted into the rear fuselage of single-engine fighters. In general, the focal length in cm was indicated by the first number and the plate size by the second, thus Rb50/30. As an example, the Do 17P carried Rb 20/30 + Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 + Rb 50/18 cameras as well as defensive guns. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit. Other configurations arose as needed.Stanley, 172‚Äì176 e.a. Japanese cameras were a mixture of domestic and imported/copied types. The Navy often used copies of the American Fairchild K-8 and K-20, and also a copy of the U.S. Navy's F-8. The Army used small, usually handheld Type 96, 99 (K-20), and 100. Konica and Nikon were the main manufactures. Some German cameras were also used. As Japanese reconnaissance aircraft were multi-seat, the rear observer usually operated the cameras. Japan trained only a relative handful of officers as photo interpreters.Stanley Legacy Because of their initial disregard for reconnaissance, all belligerents shared in the failure to develop and field a dedicated, survivable air reconnaissance platform, although they belatedly recognized the need therefore. As a result, nearly all recon aircraft were converted combat aircraft, and the proposed dedicated U.S. types (F-11 and F-12) were canceled after the peace. Soon after the war, the CIA did develop such a dedicated aircraft, the U-2. From 1945 aerial reconnaissance became a critical, high-priority component of national security in both the U.S. and Britain. The results obtained from reconnaissance were controversial. Bomb Damage Assessment (BDA) generally revealed less damage than bombers estimated, and even the BDA was found to be inflated after ground truth could be established. The tendency to overestimate both threat and damage was endemic to the field.Ehlers Questions arose over why German reconnaissance had been ineffective. Babington Smith noted that the Zossen image library was soon discovered in a barn in Bad Reichenhall near Berchtesgaden, and that the square-foot sized photographs were impressive. But interrogations revealed that the interpreters were poorly trained, did not use stereoscopes, and ‚Äúit was a horrible warning as to what photographic intelligence can become if it is based on the wrong concepts, and staffed almost entirely by uninspired plodders.‚ÄùBab. Smith, 257-9 The failure of the Axis to measure up in reconnaissance cannot be ascribed to technical deficiency or indifference. Despite many efforts in this direction, it also cannot be wholly ascribed to top-level stupidity, since the Axis had no monopoly on this either. As in many other aspects of the war, it instead highlighted that reconnaissance must be viewed and developed holistically, as a national (or multinational) capability integrating many advanced resources, scientific, industrial, and intellectual; it also requires a centralized management tying it in with other intelligence specialties and related disciplines like targeting. In these matters, once aroused, the Anglo powers together had the required heft and persistence; the opposition simply was not nearly as strong or as mentally adjusted to a protracted global conflict.Ehlers One of the top objectives of Allied occupation was the center of optical excellence in Jena; Colonel Goddard said that U.S. bombers had orders to spare Jena. In June 1945 the Americans under Goddard evacuated most of the top scientific staff to the West; however, Soviet troops moved the physical plant to the USSR, enslaving the remaining high-value workers there.Goddard, 345 As soon as the war ended, the USAAF in Europe used existing resources in an all-out effort to map Europe from the air before diplomatic considerations would make it difficult. Similar efforts were made elsewhere. The United States got access to a limited amount of German coverage of the European part of the Soviet Union, and soon began a costly and technically ambitious program to obtain pictures of the rest. From 1946, the focus was no longer just on photography, but on signals intelligence and especially on new air sampling methods to detect and analyze nuclear fall-out. The extremely close operating relationship between the RAF and the USAAF (USAF from 1947) would survive the war, and the tactics, technology, terminology and in general the shared intellectual infrastructure in aerial surveillance and analysis would transition into the Cold War, becoming embodied in the National Reconnaissance Office by 1960. By then, no other country, including the Soviet Union, had national technical means for reconnaissance remotely rivaling those the RAF-USAF founded during the war.Brugioni See also *Aerial reconnaissance in World War I ReferencesBibliography *Col.

The company was founded using left-over funds from the short-lived Glasgow Repertory which had folded in 1914. Its first director was Andrew P. Wilson. The Scottish National Players performed early plays by James Bridie, such as The Sunlight Sonata and Brandane's The Glen is Mine, as well as an ill-fated production of Neil Gunn's drama The Ancient Fire.

Sometimes criticised for its conservatism, Scottish National Players notably turned down Joe Corrie's early masterpiece In Time o' Strife in 1927. On the other hand it was instrumental in touring drama around local communities throughout Scotland. The company also provided drama for BBC Radio in Scotland in the 1920s. In the early 1930s, James Bridie, as one of the board members, attempted to push Scottish National Players to professionalise.

The language was initially developed in support of DARPA Agent Markup Language with a goal of explaining how automated theorem provers (ATP) derive conclusions from a set of axioms. Information, inference steps, inference rules, and agents are the three main building blocks of the language. In the context of an inference step, information can play the role of antecedent (also called premise) and conclusion. Information can also play the role of axiom that is basically a conclusion with no antecedents. PML uses the broad philosophical definition of agent as opposed to any other more specific definition of agent. The use of PML in subsequent projects evolved the language in new directions broadening its capability to represent provenance knowledge beyond the realm of ATPs and automated reasoning. The original set of requirements were relaxed to include the following: information originally represented as logical sentences in the Knowledge Interchange Format were allowed to be information written in any language including the English language; and inference rules originally defined as patterns over antecedents and conclusions of inference steps were allowed to be underspecified as long as they were identified and named. These relaxations were essential to explain how knowledge is extracted from text through the use of information extraction components. Enhancements were also required to further understand motivation behind the need of automated theorem provers to derive conclusions: new capabilities were added to annotate how information playing the role of axioms were attributes as assertions from information sources; and the notion of questions and answers were introduced to the language to explain to a third- party agent why an automated theorem prover was used to prove a theorem (i.e., an answer) from a given set of axioms.

The Devereux, along with the Baskervilles and Pichards, were prominent knightly families along the Welsh marches at the beginning of the twelfth century, and linked to the Braose and Lacy lordships of the region.Brock W. Holden. Lords of the Central Marches. (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2008). page 92 William Devereux's descendants would later give rise to the Devereux family of Hereford, and the Devereux Viscounts of Hereford and Earls of Essex. Career Following the Norman conquest of England, William Devereux was granted lands along the Welsh Marches in Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Gloucester as a member of the retinue of Walter de Lacy. Shortly after the Battle of Hastings rebellion broke out along the Welsh marches. Devereux probably participated in efforts to counter the attacks of Eadric the Wild and the Welsh on Hereford. In 1069, Walter de Lacy countered an attack and then led a retaliatory raid into Wales. Eadric the Wild burned Shrewsbury, but unsuccessfully besieged its castle. Late in 1069 King William led the local forces in defeating Eadric the Wild at the Battle of Stafford, and forcing his submission in 1070. In 1075 the Revolt of the Earls broke out against King William‚Äôs rule. It was led by Roger de Breteuil, earl of Hereford; Ralph, earl of East Anglia; and Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria. Walter de Lacy, and probably William Devereux as part of his retinue, played a critical role in preventing the earl of Hereford‚Äôs forces linking up with the other rebels, which lead to the collapse of the revolt. William Devereux probably would have attended the king as he spent Christmas of 1080 at Gloucester. Devereux would have been expected to participate in king William‚Äôs movement into Wales in 1081, which may have been a military raid to quell local resistance. William Devereux‚Äôs son, Walter Devereaux, began training as a knight about 1084 in the retinue of Walter de Lacy. Following Walter de Lacy‚Äôs sudden death on 25 March 1085, the allegiance of the family was transferred to Walter de Lacy‚Äôs son, Roger de Lacy. At Domesday in 1086 William Devereux held lands along the Welsh Marches.Anna Powell-Smith, Open Domesday, accessed March 18 2012, William Devereux Lyonshall was held by William's son, Walter Devereux, and Lyonshall Castle was constructed at the direction of his overlord, Roger de Lacy during the early 1090's.

Areas where civilians lived were demarcated as Civil Lines. Later most of the prominent North Indian cities, including Bareilly, adopted this name for their commercial areas. The civil lines of Bareilly was settled between the old city and the cantonment in the late nineteenth century; only British officers used to live in the area then. Apart from the cantonment, the police lines and the railway station were also located to the south of the civil lines, While the district prison was to its west and the circuit house was situated to its north-east, where several upper class bungalows were built. A few years later, the Company Garden (now Gandhi Udyan) was constructed towards its east.

Its aim, directly inspired by the example of Dublin's Abbey Theatre (which had brought its first tour to Glasgow in 1907 with plays by JM Synge and WB Yeats), was to break Scotland's theatrical dependence on London. Over the previous thirty years, Scottish theatrical activity had been increasingly dominated by touring London companies using transport by rail to bring their productions north, a situation that had effectively contributed to the demise of the country's own stock theatre companies, which had had growing success in the mid-nineteenth century. Starting with a season at the Royalty Theatre, Glasgow which commenced on 5 April 1909, Wareing created seasons of international European and English-language drama. Glasgow Repertory was, for example, the first theatre in Britain to produce a play by Chekhov (The Seagull). It was however less successful in its aim also to produce native Scottish drama, though its company did mount some productions of new Scottish work. One of the ironies of the company's existence was its rejection in 1910 of Graham Moffat's Scots Language comedy The Causey Saint which, under the title Bunty Pulls the Strings, went on to become the box office smash hit of London's West End in 1911 and continued to win outstanding success on international tour. Glasgow Repertory folded in the autumn of 1914 with the theatre closures which took effect in Britain in the weeks immediately after the start of World War One; this even though the company, in its final season, had broken even for the first time in financial terms. Although short-lived, the practical legacy of the Glasgow Repertory was important. The company's residual funds were used in 1921 to establish the Scottish National Players, and memory of its 'national' aspirations continued to inspire a growing movement for Scottish theatrical revival in the inter-war years. When James Bridie eventually established Citizens' Theatre in 1943, his principal direct model was Arthur Wareing's Glasgow Repertory.

In 1904, Catalino was one of the few literate people in the community, and was appointed as Justice of the Peace in Jagna. However, he kept this position only for two years. He then became involved in local politics, and was elected as the first Mayor of the municipality of Jagna. He had five siblings: Agust√≠n, Catalina, Jos√©, Mar√≠a and Vicenta. The family provided three provincial governors (Filomeno, Agust√≠n, and Jos√©) ‚Äì the only family to do so in the history of Bohol. =Early training= As a child, Filomeno lived with his uncle, Rev. Fr. Filomeno Orbeta, a disciplinarian who was the parish priest in a neighbouring town, receiving instruction in both religion and basic schooling. When he was old enough, he went to the Seminario de San Carlos in Cebu City to study for priesthood. The revolution interrupted his studies and he was sent back to his family in Jagna. When the revolution ended, he returned to school to resume his studies. In college, he joined both the student organization and the debating team, where in an inter-class competition, he won the coveted Gorordo Gold Medal for excellence in oratory. The following year, he teamed up with Jos√© Briones of Cebu (who was later elected a Representative and Senator) to represent their school in an oratory competition against University of Santo Tomas in Manila. They won a pair of gold medals. He then completed his training as a priest, graduating with the highest honors. =Change of heart= At the time of his graduation, he was still two years younger than the required age for ordination. He decided to take on law, and enrolled at the Colegio de Derecho on Manila, where he obtained his bachelor's degree. During this period Filomeno fell in love with a woman, choosing to leave the priesthood, a decision that upset his parents.

Early life Born January 19, 1733 in the Colony of Virginia to William and Ann Person.Thomas Person, Stephen B Weeks, North Carolina Booklet, vol. IX, no. 1 (July 1909), 16-35 He married his cousin, Johanna Philpot; the two had no children, and his nephew William Person Little was adopted as his heir. General Thomas Person spent most of his life in service to Granville County, North Carolina. Pre-Revolution career In 1756, after several years working for Earl Granville as a surveyor, Thomas Person was recommended for the position of Justice of the Peace for Granville County. By the year 1762, he had become the county's sheriff. After his election to represent Granville County in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1764, Thomas Person would find himself on the side of the disaffected colonials in the War of the Regulation. When the Battle of Alamance ended in defeat for the Regulators, Governor William Tryon issued a series of amnesty proclamations for combatants and rioters, from which Thomas Person was specifically excluded,Proclamation by William Tryon Concerning a Pardon for Rioters, June 11, 1771 even though he was not present at the battle. Person was held for three weeks in Hillsborough but was eventually released without trial, due either to lack of evidence or his personal friendship with Edmund Fanning. In spite of his issues with Governor Tryon, Representative Person continued to serve in the state General Assembly until the beginning of the American Revolution, when he was named to the extra-legal North Carolina Provincial Congress. This body would eventually \\"concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring independency.\\" Revolutionary war service On May 4, 1776, Person was commissioned a Brigadier General in command of the Hillsborough District Brigade of the North Carolina militia. His service consisted mostly of raising troops and collecting supplies rather than fighting on the field, and he turned over command the following year to John Butler, who would lead the unit in the Battle of Guilford Court House. Person spent the rest of the war serving on the North Carolina Council of State.Ordinances of the Provincial Congress of North Carolina December 20, 1776 Anti-Federalist After the war ended, Thomas Person became a leader of North Carolina's Anti-Federalists. They opposed the ratification of the United States Constitution on the grounds \\"that the Senate would become a bastion of aristocratic privilege, that an imperial president would overawe a complacent Congress, and that an intrusive federal court system would engender costly and oppressive litigation\\".North Carolina History Project The Antifederalists: North Carolina's Other Founders Though there was broad support for the anti- federalists in North Carolina (outside of the wealthy coastal regions),Encyclopedia of North Carolina Anti-Federalists the ratification by 11 of the other colonies and the formulation of the Bill of Rights made it clear that ratification was inevitable by the end of 1789. Nevertheless, at the Fayetteville Convention in 1789, Thomas Person would vote Nay.

He was involved in the Manhattan Project, and was later director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Early life and education Larson was born in Cloquet, Minnesota, in 1909.Who was who in America - Marquis Who's Who, Marquis Who's Who Staff - Google Books As a teenager he was involved in church groups and the local YMCA, and occasionally acted as a substitute minister at nearby parishes. In his primary education, Larson was selected for a class that combined both seventh and eighth grades which meant he entered high school a year younger than his peers. In high school he created his own telegraph network between his neighbors' houses by collecting discarded parts from the Bell telephone company. He had not intended to attend university as very few high school graduates in his home town did so. Larson studied chemistry and chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1932, and obtained a Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, studying blood clotting. Larson designed a glass electrode in order to measure the acidity of flowing solutions, while at UC, Berkeley. His later work focused on isotopes produced by a cyclotron, invented by his future colleague, Ernest Lawrence. His study of the behavior of ions in electric fields gave him a good understanding of electrochemistry, which he would later come to use in the Manhattan Project. From 1939 to 1942 Larson chaired the Chemistry Department at the College of the Pacific, where he continued his cyclotron research, which led to his recruitment into the Manhattan Project. Y-12 National Security Complex Larson was senior chemist from 1942 to 1945 on Ernest Lawrence's team that oversaw the construction and operation of the Y-12 National Security Complex. The plant used electromagnetic isotope separation to produce most of the uranium-235 for Little Boy, the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Larson suggested and oversaw improvements to the plant that increased the yield of the process. Uranium atoms were buried in the walls of the stainless steel receivers by the calutrons, then recovered chemically. Larson's solution was to copper-plate the receivers, which increased the yield as more atoms could be more easily recovered from copper than stainless steel. In 1948, Larson became the director of the Y-12 Complex. Oak Ridge National Laboratory In 1950, Larson was appointed Director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He oversaw a US$20 million (US$255 million in 2013) expansion of the laboratory, the creation of three nuclear reactors at the site, and a partnership with the US Navy to design nuclear-powered ships. He also began an experiment into nuclear-powered aircraft. He served as Director until 1955. Union Carbide In 1955, Larson left Oak Ridge, Tennessee to become vice president of the National Carbon Division of Union Carbide Corporation. He returned to Oak Ridge from 1961 to 1969, as president of Union Carbide Nuclear Division, when the company was tasked with management of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He oversaw management of the laboratory, the Y-12 Plant and the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and was also responsible for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Atomic Energy Commission Larson was appointed commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission thanks to his reputation as a \\"knowledgeable and judicious administrator\\". He served as commissioner from 1969 to 1974, a time of great uncertainty for the nuclear industry. He commissioned a series of public hearings on nuclear reactor safety, especially concerning emergency cooling. The AEC turned to Larson's former employer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to aid in the formation of reactor regulations.

All three men served as the Prime Minister of Bengal in British India and after independence two of them also served as Prime Minister of Pakistan. The monument was designed by architect S.A.K. Masud Ahmad (Former Chief Architect, Govt. of Bangladesh) and was established in 1963 during East Pakistan. The style of architecture of the monuments is an interpretation of Islamic Arcs. History The Mausoleum of three leaders was established in the year 1963. It was designed by architect S.A.K. Masud Ahmad. The three political leaders are A.K. Fazlul Huq, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Khawaja Nazimuddin. The three leaders died on different dates but were all buried in the same area as all three of them had contributed significantly to East Pakistan and were all involved politically. A.K. Fazlul Huq was a very well known politician who was famous for his leadership qualities. One of his most important contributions was being involved with the Bengali Language Movement. He also presented the Lahor Prostab (Lahore Resolution) in 1940. Fazlul Huq along with Huseyn Suhrawardy had engaged in many political acts such as forming the United Front in the 1954 elections, with which they had gained victory by winning the most seats. Huseyn Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq had also worked together to control the government of East Pakistan. However, it was rumored that Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq had rivalry between them which had caused Fazul Huq to step down from politics. Suhrawardy was known to be the founder of the Bangladesh Awami League. He was also known to contribute significantly to the growth and development of East Pakistan. Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1956 but resigned in 1957. Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin served as the second Governor-General of Pakistan from 1948 to 1951 and also served as the second Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1951 to 1953. Suhrawardy had served as the Minister of Labor and also the Minister of Civil Supplies under Khawaja Nazimuddin. Even with all these achievements, it was rumored that these three political leaders had a rivalry with each other in terms of success. However, despite their rivalry, three of the political leaders were buried under the same roof of the mausoleum of the three leaders. Site The Mausoleum of three leaders is located in Suhrawardy Udyan in Shahbagh across from the Doyel Chattar near the University of Dhaka.

She painted portraits, landscapes and religious scenes. She was born in Philadelphia but lived and worked abroad most of her life in Britain. Merritt worked as a professional artist for most of her adult life, 'living by her brush' before her brief marriage to Henry Merritt and after his death.  Life  Ophelia, 1880, National Gallery of Art Anna Massey Lea was born in 1844 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of an affluent Quaker couple, Joseph Lea and Susanna Massey, and the eldest of six sisters. She studied anatomy at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. In 1865, the family moved to Europe, where she took art lessons from Stefano Ussi, Heinrich Hoffman, L√©on Cogniet and Alphonse Legros. They moved to London in 1870 to escape the Franco- Prussian War, and in 1871 she met Henry Merritt (1822-1877), a noted art critic and picture conservator,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Merritt, Henry who would become her tutor and later, her husband. They married 17 April 1877 but he died 10 July the same year. She had no children and did not marry again. Merritt spent the rest of her life in England, though with frequent trips to the United States, with exhibitions and awards in both countries, becoming a celebrated artist. She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1894-95 she painted the walls of St Martin's Church, Blackheath village, using a new technique of painting on dry plaster using silicone-based paints to counter the effects of damp. The paintings are of scenes from the life of Christ. She died in England on 5 April 1930, in Hurstbourne Tarrant, Hampshire.  Love Locked Out  Love Locked Out (1890), Merritt's best known painting. Merritt painted her best-known work, Love Locked Out, in 1890, in memory of her husband who had died in 1877 just three months after their wedding. She had hoped to have the image, a portrayal of Cupid standing before a locked door,Love Locked Out on the website of Tate Britain done in bronze as a monument, but could not afford it. Merritt initially resisted allowing the painting to be copied despite innumerable requests, because she feared the subject would be misinterpreted: \\"I feared people liked it as a symbol of forbidden love,\\" she wrote in her memoir, \\"while my Love was waiting for the door of death to open and the reunion of the lonely pair\\". Though Merritt was already a recognized working artist, she had intended to end her professional career after her wedding, but she returned to painting after her husband's death. Although she was American, Love Locked Out was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1890 and became the first painting by a woman artist acquired for the British national collection through the Chantrey Bequest. Thoughts on women in the arts In 1900, Merritt wrote that she felt she had not faced much if any discrimination because of her gender, but noted the social pressures which could inhibit a female artist's career, concluding: > The chief obstacle to a woman's success is that she can never have a wife. > Just reflect what a wife does for an artist: Darns the stockings; keeps his > house; writes his letters; visits for his benefit; wards off intruders; is > personally suggestive of beautiful pictures; always an encouraging and > partial critic. It is exceedingly difficult to be an artist without this > time-saving help. A husband would be quite useless. Portrait of her husband, Henry Merritt, 1877 During the 19th century there were a significant number of women who became successful, educated artists, a rarity before that time, except for a few like Angelica Kauffman and Louise √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun (1755-1842).Annette Stott. \\"Floral Femininity: A Pictorial Definition\\". American Art. The University of Chicago Press. 6: 2 (Spring, 1992). p. 75. The emerging women artists created works with a different perspective than men, challenged the limited concepts of femininity and created a genre of floral-female paintings, in which \\"the artist placed one woman or more in a flower garden setting and manipulated composition, color, texture and form to make the women look as much like flowers as possible.\\" The approach was not used for portraits. Its form of feminine representation has largely gone unrecognized by American art scholars and conservative society ignored in response to the burgeoning \\"New Woman\\" beginning in the late 19th century.Annette Stott. \\"Floral Femininity: A Pictorial Definition\\". American Art. The University of Chicago Press. 6: 2 (Spring, 1992). p. 61. Merritt created flower-feminine paintings, noting floral-feminine symbolism employed by male artists like Charles Courtney Curran and Robert Reid, she said that she saw \\"flowers as 'great ladies' noting that 'theirs is the langour of high breeding, and the repose and calm of weary idleness.\\"Annette Stott. \\"Floral Femininity: A Pictorial Definition\\". American Art. The University of Chicago Press. 6: 2 (Spring, 1992). p. 62. Merritt also pursued more traditional techniques and subject matter that were in line with what male artists pursued at the time. For example, she taught herself etching and produced a Shakespearean-influenced etching of Ellen Terry as Ophelia.

He is best known as the founder and figurehead of the Transition movement, which he initiated in 2005. Hopkins has written four books on environmentalism and activism. Biography= Early family life and background (1968‚Äì1996) = Born in Chiswick, London, Rob grew up in London until the age of 12, when he moved to Wiltshire, attending St John's School, before then moving to Bristol where he went to the Bristol Waldorf School for 2 years, followed by Henbury School to do A'Levels. This was followed by an Art Foundation course at Bower Ashton Art College, also in Bristol. From 1988, he spent two and a half years living at Istituto Lama Tsong Khapa, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Tuscany, Italy, working as the House Manager. From here he then spent a year travelling in India, Pakistan (including a visit to the Hunza Valley), China, Tibet, Hong Kong and then back to India where he met Emma, who has been his partner since then. They settled in Bristol, where Rob did a degree in 'Environmental Quality & Resource Management' at the University of the West of England, and also undertook his Permaculture Design Course. = Ireland (1996‚Äì2005) = With students at Kinsale FEC, July 2005. In 1996, Rob and his young family moved to south west Ireland, to West Cork. He initially worked with An Taisce West Cork, writing and illustrating a booklet called 'Woodlands for West Cork!'. He began teaching permaculture, initially as short courses, and building up to running full design courses, initially as an evening class. Together with another family, he and Emma set up Baile Dulra Teoranta, a charity, with the intention of creating an ecovillage project. In 1999, with another family, they bought The Hollies, a farm near Castletown, Enniskeane. After a few years, they were granted the first planning permission for an ecovillage development. In 2001, he started and taught the Practical Sustainability course at Kinsale Further Education College, initially as a one-year course, and later as the first 2-year Permaculture course in the world. Between 2003 and 2005, the students built the 'Wooden O Theatre', an amphitheatre using local materials. The Hollies ran a series of courses in natural building and built two new cob houses, using local and natural materials. In October 2004, Rob and Emma's house was destroyed in a fire. In 2004, he became aware of the concept of peak oil, and set his students the task of applying permaculture principles to addressing this challenge. The output of this student project was the ‚ÄòKinsale Energy Descent Action Plan‚Äô, which was uploaded to the college website. Much to the surprise of the authors, it was downloaded by interested parties around the world. In July 2005, Kinsale FEC hosted Fuelling the Future, a conference on peak oil and solutions to it. =Transition Town Totnes (2005‚Äìpresent)= TTT graphic by Wordsmith One.In 2005, Rob and his family moved to Totnes, England, and there co-founded, with Naresh Giangrande, Transition Town Totnes, the first official Transition Town.

She was a powerful political figure in Scotland during the youth of King James V, and her wealth and influence attracted misogynous comment from her faction's enemies. Family background Isobel Hoppar was the daughter of an Edinburgh merchant Richard Hoppar. Katrine Hoppar who married Andrew Moubray of Moubray House in Edinburgh was probably her niece. Her family connections are shown in a 1510 transaction when Katrine Hoppar's father William Hoppar, Isobel's husband John Murray of Barony and the royal secretary Adam Otterburn husband of Eufamia Moubray were witnesses together.Protocol book of John Foular (Scottish Record Society, 1941) nos. 548-9.

When James V reached his majority and escaped from the Douglases in 1528, he began to take revenge on the Douglas family. Archibald and Isobel lost the Forrester house, and the lands she held near Peebles. On Saturday 5 September 1528 the Earl of Angus shouted over the Tweed to the Earl of Northumberland's steward Roger Lassells that he should expect them and the young Earl of Huntly as refugees at Norham Castle. If his family was forced into exile, Lassels would provide a chamber at Norham for Margaret Douglas, and Isobel Hoppar would wait on her.State Papers of King Henry the Eight, vol. IV, part. IV (London, 1836), pp. 509-510. Margaret was delivered to England at Norham in October.

The English diplomat Thomas Magnus noted that Isobel was a powerful character in the Douglas family dynamic. He wrote, sharing the opinion of the 'common voice' recorded by Adam Abell, that Isobel \\"totally ordoured\\" Kilspindie, and in turn Kilspindie and George Douglas had brought the Earl of Angus to his troubles; > \\"the Erle of Angus was ...

During 2003 Swanson sent Shana's father Peter Madoff two regulatory requests, although by the time of the second request Swanson's responsibility for the examination had been transferred to a different Assistant Director at the SEC. In March 2004, SEC lawyer Genevievette Walker-Lightfoot, who was reviewing Madoff's firm, raised questions to Swanson (Walker-Lightfoot's boss's supervisor) about unusual trading at a Bernie Madoff fund; Walker-Lightfoot was told to instead concentrate on an unrelated matter. Swanson and Walker-Lightfoot's boss asked for her research, but did not act upon it. In February 2006, Swanson was emailed by Assistant Director John Nee that the SEC‚Äôs New York Regional Office was investigating a complaint that Bernard Madoff might be running ‚Äúthe biggest Ponzi scheme ever.‚Äù In April 2006, Swanson began to date Shana Madoff. Swanson reported the relationship to his supervisor who wrote in an email \\"I guess we won't be investigating Madoff anytime soon.\\" In 2006, the SEC's New York Enforcement Office, of which Swanson was not a part, closed its investigation of Bernie Madoff. On 15 September 2006, Swanson left the SEC. On 8 December 2006, Swanson and Shana Madoff became engaged.\\"Unlikely Player Pulled Into Madoff Swirl\\", by Stephen Labaton, December 18, 2008, The New York Times In 2009, after the scandal broke, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz investigated, and concluded that there was no evidence that Swanson's romantic relationship with Shana Madoff influenced the closing of the SEC investigation of Madoff.\\"Report Details How Madoff‚Äôs Web Ensnared S.E.C.\\", by David Stout, September 2, 2009, The New York Times He did conclude, however, that: \\"Swanson's communication with Shana during the period of time he was engaged in a cause examination of her uncle and father's firm, created the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.\\" The September 29, 2007, wedding between Swanson and Shana Madoff was attended by Lori Richards, the SEC's Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations, who oversaw the Division in which Swanson worked at the SEC. In 2008, Bernard Madoff spoke at a business roundtable meeting of his \\"very close\\" relationship with an SEC lawyer, and chuckled: \\"my niece even married one\\". In April 2009, Richards recused herself from the Madoff investigation. Ameriprise Financial Subsequent to working at the SEC, Swanson was a Vice President of regulatory strategy at Ameriprise Financial, a financial services company based in Minnesota. BATS Swanson is the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, an electronic stock exchange that is the third-largest stock exchange in the United States, which he joined as General Counsel in January 2008. He was hired in part to assist the exchange in its effort to obtain exchange status from the SEC.

Detention dams are commonly used to reduce the damage caused by flooding or to manage the flow rate through a channel. Detention dams can also be constructed to replenish groundwater and trap sediment. Detention dams are one of three classifications of dams: storage dams, diversion dams, and detention dams. Storage dams store water for extended times for irrigation, livestock, municipal water supply, recreation, and hydroelectric power generation. Diversion dams raise the water level to redirect the water to a designated location. The diverted water typically supplies irrigation systems or reservoirs. Purposes People build detention dams for purposes that include: flood control, flow rate restriction, subsurface water replenishment, and sediment trapping. Detention dams are common in flood prone areas for flood control. A detention dam is built at an elevation above the flood prone zone. Flood water collects in the basin above the dam and is released at a flow rate the flood zone and channel can accommodate. Channels can include dikes, canals, streams, drain pipes, and rivers. The basin above a flood detention dam should remain at the lowest water level to prevent overtopping. Overtopping is when the water level behind the dam exceeds the dam crest height. The dam crest is the top edge of the dam. Overtopping is caused by extreme flooding or severe waves. The severe waves can be a result of high winds, landslides, and earthquakes. The detention dam design must take into account the probability of overtopping occurring and be designed accordingly. Detention dams built to restrict flow rate regulate the amount water released into channels. Detentions dams used to replenishment the subsurface water or groundwater hold surface runoff to allow the ground to absorb the water. Groundwater is water that has drained into an aquifer due to the force of gravity. An aquifer is layers of permeable soils and rocks below the earth's surface that allow water to accumulated between the rocks and soils. Debris dams are a type of detention dam used to collect sediment to prevent it from flowing into areas where large sediment buildup may be damaging. Design Detention dams have two basic designs. The detention dam can be made from concrete or masonry, usually with a metal reinforcing substructure. The concrete or masonry style dam commonly has a cross sectional shape similar to a right triangle with the sloping face pointing downstream and the perpendicular face pointing upstream. Detention dams can also be made from rock or earth to form a gravity embankment style dam. The cross sectional shape of an earth and rock gravity embankment style dam closely resembles an equal lateral triangle with the angled sides facing upstream and downstream. Modern detentions dam designs incorporate safety factors that account for and compensate for the probability of failure. =Flood Detention Dam Design= Flood detention dams are commonly used as part of a flood or storm water detention system. Flood detention systems combine detention basins, detention dams, and channels to efficiently collect and regulate runoff. Detention facilities not only regulate the amount of released water, but control release water quality. Systems monitor runoff to prevent contaminates and debris from damaging lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Flood detention dams are constructed methodically. Engineers analyze watershed topographical data, hydrological records, and geological structure for the area to determine the most effective locations flood detention dams. The analyzed watershed topographical data, hydrological records, and geological structure display the potential storage capacity, environmental impacts, and physical limitations of the area. This produces models that simulate the effectiveness of possible flood detention dam locations and designs. The general design for a flood detention dam has a cross sectional shape of a trapezoid, where the longer of the parallel sides is the base of the dam, and the angled sides face upstream and downstream. The flood detention dam has an opening at the top to release the flood water at a controlled rate that the channels below can accommodate. Flood detention dam models help determine the necessary dam height and overflow opening size to prevent over-topping. Disadvantages Detention dams can cause injury and damage if they are not built and maintained correctly. Poorly maintained and older detention dams can pose a reliability threat because they may not meet the current structural safety and hydraulic requirements. For example, a detention dam in a populated area that does not conform to the current structural safety and hydraulic requirements has a high probability of failing. If severe flood were to occur, the nonconforming detention dam could be overtopped and breached resulting in injury and damage of the surrounding populated area below the detention dam. Examples=Sediment Detention Dam Example= The area of Fifteenmile Creek, Wyoming was flagged by the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management in the 1960s because the area was in need of an aggressive sediment control system. Over the course of 10 years, US$2 million was spent to construct 34 sediment detention dams, 110 reservoirs, and 21 spreader dikes to manage the sediment issue. The sediment control system was intended to reduce the amount of suspended sediment in the Bighorn River. The high sediment concentration in the Bighorn River was largely attributed to the drainage from the Fifteenmile Creek erosion. The control system was intended to reduce the sediment amount by 25%. However, 20 years after installation the control system was analyzed and uncovered that the detention dams had been improperly maintained, resulting in sediment detention failure. In addition to poor maintenance, the functional lives of the detention dams were shortened because of the location and climate. As a result, people who live downstream of the Bighorn River have to cope with the effects of the sediment. The high amounts of sediment released from the failed detention dams and control system have increased the cost to filter municipal water due to suspended sediment in the Bighorn River. The high sediment deposits have also damaged fisheries and reduced the amount of water that can be stored in a downstream reservoir. =Flood Detention Dam Example= In San Antonio, Texas, the Olmos Creek detention dam was constructed as a flood detention dam. Even though the Olmos Creek detention dam‚Äôs primary purpose was as a flood detention dam, the dam also acts as debris or sediment detention dam to trap pollutants from entering regional the water supply. The Olmos Creek detention dam is unique because it is located in an urban area with a large floodplain and the area around the detention dam is used as a recreational and wildlife area. As a result, the Olmos Creek detention dam is a multipurpose facility that can handle large floods, trap pollutants, and provide a recreational and wildlife area for the community.

All the courses are tuned in unison, with no octaves. It is tuned D3 D3, G3 G3, B3 B3, E4 E4. It has a floating bridge and a metal tailpiece. The instrument body is often carved from a single block of wood.  The Macedonian tambura  The Macedonian tambura has 4 steel strings in 2 doubled courses. It is tuned A A , D D (or another pitch but at the same relative intervals of a fourth) when playing melodies based on A tonic upon A drone. It also may be tuned G G , D D (or another pitch but at the same relative intervals of a fifth) when playing melodies based on G tonic upon G drone. Sometimes octave strings are used on the lower course. It has a floating bridge and a metal tailpiece. The instrument body is more often made from staves like a lute. Playing technique It is played with a plectrum, playing short tones which are plucked from the top down, while playing long tones with fast tremolo. For solo playing or to accompany a singer, they are played in the traditional manner, which is to play a melody on the highest course whilst using the other course or courses as a drone. The more modern way, which is more used in orchestras or other groups, is to play single line melodies using all courses. Form Both varieties of tambura have a long, narrow neck with 18 or 20 frets. The frets are nowadays always arranged in the normal Western 12 note scale, although in the past the Farkas system was also used. The Bulgarian tambura's body is rather shallow and flat, whereas the Macedonian tambura has a much more rounded, bowl-like body.

The beating nearly killed Sumner and it contributed significantly to the country's polarization over the issue of slavery. It has been considered symbolic of the \\"breakdown of reasoned discourse\\" and the use of violence that eventually led to the Civil War. Background In 1856, during the \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" crisis, Sumner denounced the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act in his \\"Crime against Kansas\\" speech, delivered on May 19 and May 20. The long speech argued for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state and went on to denounce the \\"Slave Power\\"‚Äîthe political arm of the slave owners: Sumner then attacked the authors of the Act, Senators Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Butler of South Carolina, saying, Sumner was alluding that Butler was Don Quixote and slavery was his Dulcinea. In addition, Sumner mocked Butler's speaking ability, which had been impeded by a recent stroke: According to Manisha Sinha (2003), Sumner had been ridiculed and insulted by both Douglas and Butler for his opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, with Butler crudely race- baiting Sumner by making sexual allusions to black women, like many slaveholders who accused abolitionists of promoting interracial marriage. Sexually charged accusations were also part of the abolitionist lexicon. According to Hoffer (2010), \\"It is also important to note the sexual imagery that recurred throughout the (Sumner's) oration, which was neither accidental nor without precedent. Abolitionists routinely accused slaveholders of maintaining slavery so that they could engage in forcible sexual relations with their slaves.\\" Douglas said during the speech that \\"this damn fool is going to get himself killed by some other damn fool.\\" Representative Preston Brooks, Butler's first cousin once removed,The relationship between Brooks and Butler is often reported inaccurately. \\"In reality, Brooks's father Whitfield Brooks, and Andrew Butler were first cousins.\\" was infuriated. He later said that he intended to challenge Sumner to a duel, and consulted with fellow South Carolina Representative Laurence M. Keitt on dueling etiquette. Keitt told him that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing, and that Sumner was no better than a drunkard, due to the supposedly coarse language he had used during his speech. Brooks said that he concluded that since Sumner was no gentleman, he did not merit honorable treatment; to Keitt and Brooks, it was more appropriate to humiliate Sumner by beating him with a cane in a public setting. Day of the attack Congressman Laurence Keitt advised Brooks and was with him when he assaulted Sumner Two days later, on the afternoon of May 22, Brooks entered the Senate chamber with Keitt and another ally, Congressman Henry A. Edmundson. They waited for the galleries to clear, being particularly concerned that there be no ladies present to witness what Brooks intended to do. He confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. \\"Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine,\\" Brooks calmly announced in a low voice. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head. The force of the blows so shocked Sumner that he lost his sight immediately. \\"I no longer saw my assailant, nor any other person or object in the room. What I did afterwards was done almost unconsciously, acting under the instincts of self-defense,\\" he recalled later. Congressman Henry A. Edmundson also advised Brooks and was with him during the assault on Sumner Lithograph of Preston Brooks' 1856 attack on Sumner; the artist depicts the faceless assailant bludgeoning Sumner Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk, which was bolted to the floor. His chair, which was pulled up to his desk, moved back and forth on a track; Sumner either could not or did not think to slide his chair back to escape, so it pinned him under his desk. Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner rose to his feet and ripped the desk from the floor in an effort to get away from Brooks. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood. He staggered up the aisle and, arms outstretched, vainly attempted to defend himself. But then he was an even larger and easier target for Brooks, who continued to beat him across the head, face, and shoulders \\"to the full extent of [my] power.\\" Brooks didn't stop when his cane snapped; he continued thrashing Sumner with the piece which held the gold head. Sumner stumbled and reeled convulsively, \\"Oh Lord,\\" he gasped \\"Oh! Oh!\\" Near the end of the attack, Sumner collapsed unconscious, although shortly before he succumbed he \\"bellowed like a calf\\" according to Brooks. Brooks grabbed the falling Sumner, held him up by the lapel with one hand, and continued to lash out at him with the cane in the other. Several other Senators and Representatives attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Edmundson, who yelled at the spectators to leave Brooks and Sumner alone, and Keitt, who brandished his own cane and a pistol, and shouted, \\"Let them be!\\" and \\"Let them alone, God damn you, let them alone!\\" Senator John J. Crittenden attempted to intervene, and pleaded with Brooks not to kill Sumner. Senator Robert Toombs then interceded for Crittenden, telling Keitt not to attack someone who was not a party to the dispute, though Toombs also indicated later that he had no issue with Brooks beating Sumner, and in fact approved of it. Representatives Ambrose S. Murray and Edwin B. Morgan were finally able to intervene and restrain Brooks, at which point he quietly left the chamber. Murray obtained the aid of a Senate page and the Sergeant at Arms, Dunning R. McNair. As Sumner regained consciousness they were able to assist him to walk to a cloakroom. Sumner received first aid and medical attention, including several stitches. With the aid of Nathaniel P. Banks, the Speaker of the House, and Senator Henry Wilson, Sumner was able to travel by carriage to his lodgings, where he received further medical treatment. Brooks also required medical attention before leaving the Capitol; he had hit himself above his right eye with one of his backswings. The cane Brooks used was broken into several pieces, which he left on the blood-soaked floor of the Senate chamber. Some, including the cane's gold head, were recovered by Edmundson, who gave the portion with the head to Adam John Glossbrenner, the House Sergeant at Arms. This portion of the cane eventually ended up at the Old State House Museum in Boston; it was worked to smooth the edges and finish, and then put on display. Southern lawmakers made rings out of the other pieces Edmundson recovered from the Senate floor, which they wore on neck chains to show their solidarity with Brooks, who boasted \\"[The pieces of my cane] are begged for as sacred relics.\\" Aftermath Old State House in Boston The episode revealed the polarization in America, which had now reached the floor of the Senate. Sumner became a martyr in the North and Brooks a hero in the South. Northerners were outraged. The Cincinnati Gazette said, \\"The South cannot tolerate free speech anywhere, and would stifle it in Washington with the bludgeon and the bowie-knife, as they are now trying to stifle it in Kansas by massacre, rapine, and murder.\\" William Cullen Bryant of the New York Evening Post, asked, \\"Has it come to this, that we must speak with bated breath in the presence of our Southern masters?... Are we to be chastised as they chastise their slaves? Are we too, slaves, slaves for life, a target for their brutal blows, when we do not comport ourselves to please them?\\" Thousands attended rallies in support of Sumner in Boston, Albany, Cleveland, Detroit, New Haven, New York, and Providence. More than a million copies of Sumner's speech were distributed. Two weeks after the caning, Ralph Waldo Emerson described the divide the incident represented: \\"I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom.\\" Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The Richmond Enquirer editorialized that Sumner should be caned \\"every morning\\", praising the attack as \\"good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences\\" and denounced \\"these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate\\" who \\"have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission.\\" Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. One was inscribed \\"Hit him again.\\" Representative Anson Burlingame publicly humiliated Brooks by goading him into challenging Burlingame to a duel, only to set conditions designed to intimidate Brooks into backing down. (As the challenged party, Burlingame, who was a crack shot, had the choice of weapons and dueling ground. He selected rifles on the Canada side of Niagara Falls, where U.S. anti-dueling laws would not apply. Brooks withdrew his challenge, claiming that he did not want to expose himself to the risk of violence by traveling through Northern states to get to Niagara Falls.) Brooks also threatened Senator Henry Wilson, Sumner's colleague from Massachusetts. Wilson called the beating by Brooks \\"brutal, murderous, and cowardly,\\" and in response Brooks challenged Wilson to a duel. Wilson declined, saying that he could not legally or by personal conviction participate, and calling dueling \\"the lingering relic of a barbarous civilization.\\" In reference to a rumor that Brooks might attack him in the Senate, Wilson told the press \\"I have sought no controversy, and I seek none, but I shall go where duty requires, uninfluenced by threats of any kind.\\" Wilson continued to perform his Senate duties, and Brooks did not make good on his threat. Historian William Gienapp has concluded that Brooks' \\"assault was of critical importance in transforming the struggling Republican party into a major political force.\\" Southerners mocked Sumner, claiming he was faking his injuries. They argued that the cane Brooks used was not heavy enough to inflict severe injuries. They also claimed that Brooks had not hit Sumner more than a few times, and had not hit him hard enough to cause serious health concerns. In fact, Sumner suffered head trauma that caused him chronic, debilitating pain for the rest of his life and symptoms consistent with what is now called traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder; he spent three years convalescing before returning to his Senate seat. Brooks claimed that he had not intended to kill Sumner, or else he would have used a different weapon. In a speech to the House defending his actions, Brooks stated that he \\"meant no disrespect to the Senate of the United States\\" or the House by his attack on Sumner. Brooks was arrested for the assault. He was tried in a District of Columbia court, convicted, and fined $300 ($ in today's dollars), but received no prison sentence. A motion for Brooks' expulsion from the House failed, but he resigned on July 15 in order to permit his constituents to ratify or condemn his conduct via a special election. They approved; Brooks was quickly returned to office after the August 1 vote, and then re-elected to a new term of office later in 1856, but he died of croup before the new term began. Keitt was censured by the House. He resigned in protest, but his constituents ratified his conduct by overwhelmingly reelecting him to his seat within a month. In 1858, he attempted to choke Representative Galusha Grow of Pennsylvania (Republican) for calling him a \\"negro driver\\" during an argument on the House floor. An effort to censure Edmundson failed to obtain a majority of votes in the House. In the 1856 elections, the new Republican Party made gains by use of the twin messages of \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" and \\"Bleeding Sumner\\", because both events served to paint pro-slavery Democrats as extremists. Though the Democrats won the presidential election and increased their majority in the House of Representatives because the Constitution's requirement to count slaves for purposes of apportioning Congressional districts and the Electoral College gave Democrats an advantage, Republicans made dramatic gains in elections for the state legislatures, which enabled them to make gains in the U.S. Senate elections, because senators were chosen by the state legislatures. The violence in Kansas and the beating of Sumner helped the Republicans coalesce and cohere as a party, which set the stage for their victory in the 1860 presidential election. During the 1856 lame duck session of Congress, Brooks made a speech calling for the admission of Kansas \\"even with a constitution rejecting slavery\\". His conciliatory tone impressed Northerners and disappointed slavery's supporters.

Painted in 1865, the concluding year of the American Civil War, the work depicts four African American Union Army teamsters sitting on the sunny side of a Sibley tent. The painting is in the collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco-(De Young) Its dimensions are 33.7 cm (13.27 in.) x 44.5 cm (17.52 in.) From November 2012 to September 2013, the painting was on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Background Early in his artistic career, Homer apprenticed to a lithographer creating images for sheet music and other publications. After the apprenticeship ended, he began making illustrations on a regular freelance basis for the magazine Harper‚Äôs Weekly. When the Civil War began, Harper's made him an artist-correspondent with the Army of the Potomac. Over the next few years, the artist directly witnessed and recorded life in the Union Army. Homer made many sketches that served as the basis for illustrations for the magazine. Toward the end of the war, he began using them for his own paintings, including The Bright Side. The work is acknowledged as Homer's transition from illustrator to painter. Its subject matter and small size mark the piece as illustration, while its style points to Homer's future as a realist painter. Description Although they received far less pay and suffered higher mortality rates than their white counterparts, nearly 190,000 African Americans, both free and fugitive, served as Union soldiers. Some worked as teamsters driving mule- and horse-drawn wagons in exposed supply trains targeted by Confederate raiders. If captured, the teamsters were frequently enslaved or executed. The year after his death, the following description of The Bright Side appeared in the catalog for a retrospective of Homer's work. ‚ÄúFour Negro teamsters are lying in the sun against the side of a tent. The man at the right wears a battered high hat, a military coat, and top boots, and holds a whip in his left hand; beyond his raised knee is the head of the second figure in a peaked military cap. The next one wears a red shirt and broad-brimmed gray hat, and his hands are clasped back of his head; the farthest one, with arms folded, wears a broad-brimmed military hat. In the opening of the tent is the head of another [N]egro with a broad-brimmed hat; a corn-cob pipe is in his mouth. Beyond, at the left, are commissariat wagons with rounded canvas tops, and near by (sic) are unharnessed mules. In the distance is the camp. In the immediate foreground, at the right, part of a barrel shows.‚Äù Critical Reception In 1856, Homer was elected to the National Academy of Design. That year, he sent three paintings to the academy's Fortieth Annual Exhibition in New York City. Critics thought The Bright Side to be his strongest work of the three, in terms of both subject matter and execution. According to the critic for The Evening Post, the work possessed a ‚Äúdirect style and faithful observation of nature.‚Äù He also found in the painting ‚Äúa dry, latent humor and vigorous emphasis of character..‚Äù Today, Homer's reputation as one of America's greatest realist painters coincides with the critic's view of him as an artist quite capable of rendering a truthful scene. The description of the piece as humorous is less understandable, since Homer rarely injected levity into his work. Although, art historian Jennifer A. Greenhill argues that levity is a popular trope in Homer's paintings. However, in light of 19th century white male thinking, many viewers, including some art critics, saw the painting as a stereotypical reference to the perceived inherent laziness of dark-skinned people. Interpretation and Controversy Scholars have long debated the painting's meaning and whether it was Homer's intention to reinforce prevailing stereotypes of African Americans. The painting's title further adds to the confusion. The Bright Side is an obvious reference to the sunny side of the tent on which the teamsters rest. Some argue it may also allude to the Union \\"side\\" that promised freedom for enslaved people of color. Another interpretation, based on the painting's alternative title Light and Shade, suggests Homer is making a disparaging pun about color at the expense of his subjects. A fourth analysis describes the title as \\"ironic\\" because the men are former slaves freed as Union soldiers marched south. The teamsters are now in essence the property of the army, but on the \\"bright side\\", they are no longer bound in the cruel servitude that triggered the Civil War. A current interpreter of Homer's oeuvre describes the painting as being of \\"special note.\\" The\\" four black Union teamsters relax outside a tent, from which another pokes his head, clenching a pipe in his teeth and glaring at us. Here are men of rangy dignity, defying any objectifying gaze. Certainly, no contemporary white artist looked with clearer eyes than Homer did at formerly enslaved Americans. A Union man, he was hardly neutral, but his first allegiance was to truth.\\" Another critic saw \\"The Bright Side\\" as referencing the Antebellum \\"uncertainty and ambivalence many white Americans felt about the prospect for an integrated society.\\" Provenance The Bright Side has had the following owners: *William H.

Life He was born the eldest son of Charles Dalbiac of Hungerford Park, Berkshire. In 1793 he joined the 4th Light Dragoons as a cornet and was promoted to lieutenant in 1794, captain in 1798, major in 1801, and lieutenant-colonel in 1808. He was posted to Portugal with his regiment in 1808 to act as second lieutenant-colonel to Lord Edward Somerset. In July 1809 he led the left wing of the 4th Light Dragoons in a charge at the battle of Talavera. He served throughout the Peninsular campaign, taking command of the regiment, in the absence of Lord Edward Somerset, at Campo Mayor in March 1811 and Los Santos in April 1811. In 1805 Dalbiac had married Susanna Isabella, eldest daughter of Lieutenant-colonel John Dalton, of Sleningford Hall, Ripon, Yorkshire. She went out to nurse him when he fell ill with a fever and stayed on by his side, famously at the Battle of Salamanca. In that battle on 22 July 1812 the 4th Light Dragoons, the 5th Dragoon Guards and the 3rd Light Dragoons were under the command of Major-general Le Marchant and took part in a charge in which the general was killed. Susanna went onto the battlefield to help the wounded. After the battle of Salamanca Dalbiac returned with his wife to England and never saw active service again. He was promoted colonel in 1814. In 1814 Susanna gave birth to her only daughter, Susanna Stephania, and in 1815 the Dalbiacs bought Moulton Hall, near Richmond, North Yorkshire, but when their daughter married James Innes-Ker, 6th Duke of Roxburghe in 1836 they were obliged to sell the house to finance her dowry. From 1822 to 1824 he was brigadier-general commanding the Goojerat district of the Bombay army and was promoted major-general in 1825 and made a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH) by William IV. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1838 and made colonel of the 3rd Dragoon Guards in 1839. He was transferred to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the 4th Light Dragoons, in September 1842. He was elected M.P. for Ripon in 1835, sitting until 1837. He died in London in 1847. Works Dalbiac wrote a catechism for young and non-commissioned cavalry officers and was a disciple of the writer Izaak Walton. He was also the author of A Few Words on the Corn Laws: Wherein are Brought Under Consideration Certain of the Statements which are to be Found in the Third Edition of Mr. McCulloch's Pamphlet Upon the Same Subject, published in 1841.

Although typically an uncontested divorce, military divorces are different because they require additional requirements to be fulfilled. Divorces occur less frequently than within the civilian population. They present a special set of challenges that make military divorces more complicated than a typical divorce. For example, The Federal Service Members Civil Relief Act of 2003 requires any person seeking a divorce to state that their spouse is or is not currently a member of the United States armed forces. This is meant to prevent spouses from seeking divorces from service members who would be unable to attend divorce proceedings. A common challenge presented by military divorce is jurisdiction - where the divorce should be filed if the service member isn't at home. A divorce may be filed at home or where the military member is stationed, both in the United States or abroad. Calculating military income Calculating the income of a member of the military requires specific knowledge and expertise, as service members are paid in a number of ways, including basic allowances for housing, expenses, and their basic pay. Division of military retirement as an asset upon divorce A servicemember who has served 20 years is entitled to receive a military retirement. Per the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act. State courts may but are not required to divide a servicemember‚Äôs ‚Äúdisposable retired pay‚Äù upon dissolution, according to that court's domestic relations laws. Jurisdiction over a service member is a prerequisite for dividing a military retirement. This jurisdiction is more than simply personal jurisdiction through service of process ‚Äì it requires either residence within the state not due to military orders, domicile in the state, or the service member‚Äôs consent.10 U.S. Code ¬ß1408(c)(4) ‚ÄúDisposable retired pay‚Äù is defined as the gross retired pay minus (A) payments back to the United States for prior military retirement overpayments and for recoupments required by law resulting from entitlement to retired pay, (B) court-martial forfeitures, (C) pay waived to receive disability payments from the Veterans Administration (VA), and (D) the Survivor Benefit Plan premium costs for a spouse or former spouse paid pursuant to court order.10 U.S. Code ¬ß1408(a)(4) \\"While the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act does not specify a minimum duration of marriage in order to divide retirement, former spouses who wish to receive their share of the retirement directly from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service must have at least 10 years of marriage overlapping the military service.10 U.S. Code ¬ß1408(d)The Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation contains a section entitled ‚ÄúFormer Spouse Payments from Retired Pay‚Äù which sets forth all of the requirements to receive direct payment from DFASBlack & Graham, LLC Military Divorce Guide re: VA Disability/Indemnity for VA Waiver: http://www.military-divorce- guide.com/va-disability-divorce/indemnity-va-waiver.htm DFAS: If retirement pay is determined to be at least partially a marital asset, DoD Regulation 7000.14-R Para 290601(C) (backed up by 10 USC 1447-1455) requires that division orders specify a dollar amount of award or a percentage of retirement pay with no offsets or set asides. The only way to specify the correct percentage when there have been promotions after the divorce is via the DFAS Hypothetical Method or the Dual Coverture Value (DCV) Method (which is also called the \\"Area Method\\" (AM) because of the way it shows on an area diagram). The first involves a sequential process and the second involves a formula based on your circumstance, and handles many more circumstances of life, and correctly handles Reserve military members. All three methods give the same result, and 6 years after they were published, the promotion enhancement set- aside was embodied in Federal law with NDAA 2017 Sec 641. More than 20 attorney guides, whitepapers, and spreadsheet calculation aids are available from 10+ years of research in this area by a PhD analyst. If a military member is promoted after divorce, the promotion enhancement due to retirement would be a non-marital asset as recommended by a Department of Defense report to Congress about the USFSPA law. Courts have struggled to understand how to implement this. The result is that many times the military member's promotion enhancements, due to sole effort after the divorce, are divided to the ex- spouse. The Area Method is a straightforward method to equitably divide retirement pay in this situation for an Active Duty or Reserve retirement. For Reserve military officers, a retention benefit program was implemented providing possible early retirement if certain types of duty is done after January 28, 2008. This benefit does not cause the amount of retirement checks to increase, but it can cause an increase to the number of retirement checks to be paid prior to age 60. If a marriage was entirely prior to January 28, 2008, all of the extra checks should equitably belong to the military member, and a division order needs to state this. If a marriage was entirely after January 28, 2008, all of the extra checks should be divided in the same manner as the payments at age 60 and beyond.

Effect of VA disability payments A Supreme Court decision prohibits states from dividing VA disability payments. However, this does not preclude a state from ordering indemnity payments from a retiree who waives retired pay to receive VA disability after a decree of dissolution has issued. In the State of Michigan, an Appellate court has ruledKing v. King, 149 Mich. App. 495; 386 N.W.2d 562; 1986 Mich. App. LEXIS 2490 that any offset or indemnity is in violation of the Federal intent of preserving value for the military member, and hence offsets or indemnities are not allowed. Quoting three paragraphs from the King decision, \\"The substantive question in this case is whether the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 USC 1401 et seq., and the supremacy clause of the federal constitution, US Const, art VI, [**564] prevent a state court from treating a military disability pension as a distributable marital asset.\\" ‚ÄúThe court concluded that the trial court was precluded from considering the ex-husband's military disability pension as a marital asset and had improperly awarded the ex-wife one-half the value of the ex-husband's military disability pension. The court agreed with the ex-husband that his military pension could not be considered \\"directly or indirectly\\" in the distribution of the marital property.‚Äù \\"[***7] [**565] In McCarty, the Supreme Court clearly held [*500] that a retirement pension could not be distributed as a marital asset. In a footnote, the Court noted that this prohibition is not to be circumvented by an \\"off-setting award\\". 453 U.S. 228-229, fn 22. Although McCarty has been overruled by 10 USC 1408, its rationale applies here since 10 USC 1408 does not allow distribution of a disability pension. Thus, we agree with defendant that his military pension may not be considered \\"directly or indirectly\\" in the distribution of the marital property. Cf. Kendall v Kendall, 106 Mich App 240, 243-244; 307 NW2d 457 (1981).\\" Tax issues Servicemembers have different rules and regulations with regards to taxes that make child support a more complicated process. Because some military income and deployment benefits are not taxable, a court must decided to levy obligations based on pre-tax income or post-tax income.  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act  The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act protects military servicemembers from being sued while on duty and up to one year following service. This may present a challenge for the plaintiff when suing a member of the military for child support or other financial support.

In November 2017, he announced that he would run to represent Hawaii's 1st District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ing is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.  Early life  Ing was born and raised in Hawaii. Ing attended Kamehameha Schools Maui, Maui Community College, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and American University in Washington D.C. Ing served as UH student-body president, as a neighborhood board member, and has worked in various capacities with Hawaii's business, government, and the non- profit sectors prior to assuming public office. Ing's father died when Ing was a child. Ing worked as a harvester in the pineapple fields as a young teenager.  Hawaii State House of Representatives Ing was elected to serve the 11th House District (South Maui: Kihei, Wailea, Makena) as a first-time candidate in 2012. Ing won the Democratic primary election, and overtook three opponents, carrying 43% of the vote. Ing then defeated Republican incumbent George Fontaine in the general election with 61% of the vote to the incumbent's 35%. Ing was re-elected in the 2014 primary and general elections. In 2016, Ing faced Primary challenger, Deidre Tegarden, an aide to former Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie. Ing prevailed with 61% of the vote to his opponent's 34%. = Marriage equality and LGBT rights= In November 2013, then-Governor Neil Abercrombie convened a special election for the purpose of conducting public hearings to consider the adoption of a law that would legalize marriage for same-sex couples in Hawaii. Ing supported the legislation, delivering a speech during the final floor vote in the House in which he spoke about how the murder of Matthew Shepard impacted him as a young man and led to his eventual recognition of the need for equal rights for LGBT Americans despite his Christian background. = Same-day and automatic voter registration = In 2013 and 2014, Ing introduced a bill to provide for a same-day voter registration law. With the support of Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, and Faith Action for Community Equity (FACE), the revised bill passed and was signed into law on July 1, 2014. The law has allowed voters to register and vote during a single visit at all early-polling places in Hawaii starting in 2016, and at all polling places on election day starting in 2018. =Mark Zuckerberg's quiet title action= In 2016, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg purchased 700-acres of beach front land on the island of Kauai. Zuckerberg initiated quiet title and adverse possession lawsuits against a number of Native Hawaiian families who held \\"Kuleana\\" land rights within his 700-acre Kauai property. Ing called for mediation and community outreach and quipped that \\"in Hawaii... we don't initiate conversation by filing a lawsuit against our neighbors.\\" Ing argued that the legal mechanisms Zuckerberg attempted to use were predatory by nature as they have been used historically to \\"displace Native Hawaiians from their ancestral lands.\\" Zuckerberg ultimately dropped the lawsuits and offered an apology. = 2016 arrest = In January 2016, Ing was cited for failure to produce proof of insurance for a vehicle he owned. On July 16, he failed to appear in court in this case and was subsequently arrested. A subsequent court date was scheduled. = Campaign spending violations = On June 20, 2018, the Hawaii Campaign Spending Commission approved a $15,422 administrative fine based on allegations that Ing filed inaccurate reports during the period of 2011 to 2016. One commissioner sought to refer the matter to criminal prosecution, the other four commissioners disagreed and voted that the violations were not criminal and did not require prosecution, stating \\"there are not enough good politicians\\" and that criminal prosecution would have been fatal to Ing's political career. On July 20, 2018, Ing fired his accountant after determining his accountant inadvertently filed the wrong version of his campaign finance report on July 15. The original report, which was quickly corrected on July 16, identified a $262,830 cash balance. The corrected report corrected the balance to $100,847. The accountant confirmed his mistake in a subsequent release.  Campaign for Hawaii's first congressional district  In November 2017, Ing announced his intention to run for Hawaii's 1st congressional district, where incumbent Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa was retiring to challenge Governor David Ige in the Democratic primary for Governor of Hawaii. Ing's candidacy received widespread attention and support from the left, receiving the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, Justice Democrats, Our Revolution, the Democratic nominee for New York's 14th congressional district Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Congressman Ro Khanna and Washington Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. He received attention for his campaign ads and his pledge for universal housing. Ing finished fourth in the Democratic primary, won by former Congressman Ed Case. He drew 7,531 votes, or 6.3%.  Thirty Meter Telescope advocacy  In 2019, Ing began advocating against the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island.

Early life  Conrad Wise Chapman was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Europe where his father, John Gadsby Chapman, was working as an artist.  Career  In 1861, Chapman returned to America and enlisted in Company D, Third Kentucky Infantry, Confederate. He was wounded in Shiloh along with seeing action in Mississippi and Louisiana, before a transfer to the 46th Virginia Infantry at the request of his father to Henry Alexander Wise. Over the next 10 months, he also served with the 59th Virginia Infantry, known as the Wise Legion or Wise Brigade, with both the 46th and 59th at Chaffin's Farm on the James River in Henrico County.Later in the war, it would be the site of the Battle of Chaffin's Farm. In September 1863, the Wise Brigade was ordered south to take part in the defence of Charleston, South Carolina. Chapman was commissioned to create thirty one paintings of the city's defenses by Brig. Gen. Thomas Jordan, chief of staff to commanding Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard. This was part of a campaign by Beauregard to increase support for his ideas about the defense of the harbor in the Confederate government. Chapman served in the city from early September 1863 to March 1864. He intended to paint the entire series in Charleston, but having received word of his mother's illness, Chapman was granted furlough in April 1864 and left for Rome, Italy to visit his family. It is there that he painted 25 works‚Äîwith five also done by his father‚Äîfrom sketches he made in Charleston. Chapman created art while he was on active duty during the war. While there were several artists on the Union side who captured the war in painting, who were also active, this was not the case on the Confederate side. His works may be the only set of battle subjects painted by a Confederate artist during the war. After the end of the American Civil War, unable to reconcile to the Confederacy's loss, Chapman traveled to Mexico where he painted a series of views of the Valley of Mexico. He also spent time in France and England. In 1898, his entire collection of paintings went on view at the Union League Club in New York, where they attracted attention, but no buyers. He then moved his family to Richmond where the following year he sold 31 paintings to then Confederate Memorial Literary Society, which later became the Museum of the Confederacy and is now the American Civil War Museum.

Early life Barnes was born on November 20, 1912 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She was the daughter of James Hunter Neal and poet and folklorist Lois Diantha Mills (1889-1939). Her last name is that of her first stepfather, Wellington Barnes, founder of the Dixie-Portland Cement Company, who died in 1927. Her mother later married musicologist and Vanderbilt University professor George Pullen Jackson. Barnes attended the Girls' Preparatory School in Chattanooga, the Ward-Belmont School for Girls in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Gardner School in New York City. Career Barnes was only sixteen years old when her debut novel, Schoolgirl, was published in 1929. Based on Barnes' own experience at a boarding school for girls, the novel detailed the sexual experimentation, including lesbianism, of Naomi Bradshaw and her fellow students. The scandalous novel was a best seller internationally and got Barnes expelled from the Gardner School when her principal read it. Barnes and dramatist Alfonso Washington Pezet adapted the novel for the stage and it debuted at the Ritz Theatre on Barnes' eighteenth birthday. Starring Joanna Roos as Bradshaw, it was considered a flop and ran only 28 performances. Paramount Pictures purchased the film rights for $30,000, but the novel never made it to the screen. Paramount also signed Barnes to acting and writing contracts, but she never wrote for or acted in films. Her second novel, Beau Lover (1930), is told entirely in second person singular. She followed this up with Mother, Be Careful! (1932), which satirized Hollywood, and Young Woman (1934), which also featured Naomi Bradshaw. In 1940, she sponsored a lecture series by the architect Claude F. Bragdon which were later collected and published as The Arch Lectures (1942). The next year she studied with esotericist P. D. Ouspensky. With her husband she collaborated on the unproduced play A Passionate Victorian, about actress Fanny Kemble. In 1946, Barnes published her final novel, Time Lay Asleep, about a large family in the southern United States. In that book, Barnes experimented with chronological, psychological, and symbolic elements in a way that has been compared to the work of William Faulkner. Personal life Barnes became the second wife of writer and diplomat Hamilton Fish Armstrong in 1945. After a long separation, Barnes and Armstrong divorced in 1951. Later that year, Barnes left the United States for Austria permanently. Following a series of breakdowns in 1952, she received insulin shock therapy and psychotherapy treatment. Death Barnes died in Salzburg, Austria, in 1980.

Biography Bella Clara Fackenthal, the only child of a corset manufacturer, was born in New York in 1874. For a short time she attended the Hewitt School, where she became interested in topics such as opera and theater, and developed a lifelong passion for learning in general. However, because her father disapproved of women being able to attend college, she did not pursue further formal education. In 1900 she married Ian Nathan Landauer ‚Äî a first-generation German immigrant, successful fabric importer and salesman\\"Bella C. Landauer, Collector, was 85,\\" \\"New York Times,\\" 1960 ‚Äî and they had two children, born in 1902 and 1906 respectively. During World War I she served in the American Volunteer Field Service (AFS Intercultural Programs), but suffered ill health as a result, and in 1923 her doctor recommended that she follow less taxing pursuits. This recommendation, along with her eclectic interests, eventually led to her pursuing a career as a collector. Her first purchase was a portfolio of bookplates bought for $100 from a picture framer. It eventually emerged that this had been stolen, by which time Landauer's collection was well-established. As she built her bookplate collection, Landauer endeavoured to learn more about the field from other notable collectors. Among these was William E. Baille,, \\"The Baille Collection of Bookplates,\\" \\"Bulletin of the Metropolitan of Art\\" who was initially suspicious when Landauer expanded her interests to include the collection of manufacturing trade cards, but was eventually convinced of its historical value to future researchers. Despite lacking a formal education in advertising and commercial art, Landauer understood how collecting examples of early advertising would prove valuable, and this soon became her primary focus. She also began collecting wine bottle labels, funerary advertisements, aeronautical sheet music, and other forms of graphic and advertising art, focusing mainly on 19th century material.James J. Heslin, \\"Bella C. Landauer (pages 180-189),\\" \\"Keepers of the Past,\\" 1965 Landauer's collection of ephemera ‚Äî particularly her trade cards ‚Äî grew substantially as she sought material exemplifying various aspects of advertising. In 1926, following a move to the Drake Hotel, she gave her already significant collection of over 100,000 trade cards to the New York Historical Society, where she was made an unpaid honorary curator and continued to collect, catalog, and conduct research on the collection. She also donated duplicates from her collections, along with additional ephemera, to the Drawings and Prints department of the Metropolitan Museum of Arthttp://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/journals/1/pdf/1512886.pdf.bannered.pdf and the Harvard University Library. As her interests expanded, Bella turned her attention to other forms of sheet music, aeronautical history and theater programs. Landauer's interest in aeronautics was initiated by her son becoming a pilot. She responded by joining the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences (now known as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics), which became the first organisation to host her historically significant collection of over 1,000 pieces of sheet music. This collection covers the history of aeronautics and aviation from its beginnings to the early 20th century, and includes one of the earliest examples of aeronautical sheet music ever published: Chanson sur le Globe Aerostatique, a musical homage to the earliest balloon flights made by the Montgolfier brothers and printed in 1785.E.J. Doherty, \\"The Bella C. Landauer Collection of Aeronautical Music in the Archives of the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences, Rockefeller Center, New York,\\" \\"Flying and Popular Aviation,\\" February 1942 The collection is now part of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries' National Air and Space Museum Library, and is known as the Bella C. Landauer Collection of Aeronautical Sheet Music. Throughout her life, Landauer not only collated and shared numerous significant collections of advertising, graphic arts, and commercial printing material, but also researched and published extensively in these fields. Moreover, she acted as an adviser to several colleges on the history of commercial art and printing. She believed that advertising and commercial art were a reflection of the times in which they were created, and never more so than in the 19th century. Her work focused largely on New York City ‚Äî as the center of American advertising (and as her lifelong home) ‚Äî but her interests were international, as her collections of aeronautical sheet music, trade cards, and other ephemera reflect. Landauer continued collecting and researching until her death in 1960.

It was painted in Washington, D.C. and is now owned by the New York Public Library, on permanent loan to the New-York Historical Society. Johnson also created two versions of the painting in the 1870s, now owned by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.https://high.org/collections/negro-life-at- the-south/https://www.high.org/collections/old-kentucky-home-negro-life-at- the-south/ The painting Negro Life at the South is considered Johnson's masterpiece, and it gained attention at its first exhibit among more than 800 works at the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1859. There were numerous accounts in newspapers. The first review noted the painting was set in Washington, DC, but it soon became popularly known as Old Kentucky Home, after Home Journal used this title in a feature article about it. Subsequent coverage mostly overlooked that Johnson's painting was of an urban \\"back street\\" scene from Washington, D.C., believed to be next to the home of Johnson's father. The painting is a domestic scene behind a dilapidated house; to the right is a house in better condition. On the left in the foreground is a young couple courting, of which the woman is light-skinned; in the middle, a banjo player makes music while a boy watches, and an adult woman dances with a child, as others look on. At the right edge, a young white woman in a refined white dress is stepping over a threshold into \\"black life in the interior of a city block.\\"John Davis, \\"Eastman Johnson's Negro Life at the South and Urban Slavery in Washington, D.C.\\", Art Bulletin, March 1998, at JSTOR, accessed 26 January 2014 Behind her is another black figure. The white woman may represent Johnson's sister. An adult black woman looks out an upstairs window as she steadies a small mixed race child sitting on the partially collapsed roof. The darkest skin belongs to the woman dancing with the child in the middle foreground. The skin color variations, with nearly each individual shown as a different \\"person of color\\", reflected African-American society, but may also have been intended to invite the viewer to contemplate the mixed racial ancestry of those portrayed. Several elements hint at or symbolize relations to an unseen, wealthier white male‚Äîthe mulatto children, the ladder from the Negro quarters leaning against a larger house next door (although not near any door or window) and, symbolically, the rooster high in the tree near the taller house and hen on the Negroes' house roof. and the white cat, a tomcat perhaps, crawling in the bedroom window. Its seemingly contradictory elements have implications that have been interpreted at length.Patricia Hills. \\"Painting Race: Eastman Johnson's Pictures of Slaves, Ex-Slaves, and Freedmen\\", In Teresa A. Carbone and Patricia Hills, ed., Eastman Johnson: painting America, 1999, Brooklyn Museum of Art. The painting was interpreted by both proponents and detractors of slavery as supporting their position. Southerners associated it with plantation life and noted that the Negroes seemed cheerful in their leisure time. Northerners might concentrate on the top half of the painting, with the dilapidated roof representing the degradation of slavery and the light-skinned woman and child suggesting a theme of miscegenation.Eleanor Jones Harvey. 2012.

It depicts two young African-American women in a cotton field. > Stately, silent and with barely a flicker of sadness on their faces, the two > black women in the painting are unmistakable in their disillusionment: they > picked cotton before the war and they are still picking cotton afterward. It is oil on canvas, 24 1/16 x 38 1/8 in. (61.12 x 96.84 cm). The painting is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). Background Early in his artistic career, Homer apprenticed to a lithographer creating images for sheet music and other publications. After the apprenticeship ended, he began making illustrations on a regular freelance basis for the magazine Harper‚Äôs Weekly. When the Civil War began, Harper‚Äôs made him an artist-correspondent with the Army of the Potomac. Over the next few years, the artist directly witnessed and recorded life in the Union Army. Homer made many sketches that served as the basis for magazine illustrations. Toward the end of the war, he began using them for his own paintings. The first of these to use African American subjects is a work called \\"The Bright Side.\\" The piece is acknowledged as Homer‚Äôs transition from illustrator to painter. Its subject matter and small size mark the piece as illustration, while its style points to Homer‚Äôs future as a realist painter. After the war, the artist's interest in painting the lives of former slaves led him to return visits to Petersburg, Virginia, where he had spent time during the Civil War's final siege. From 1874 to 1876, Homer made studies for and may have painted a series of watercolors and paintings of the life of rural African Americans. Because of his realistic portrayals and sensitivity towards his subjects, the painter is known as ‚Äúfirst American consistently to paint African Americans without the prevailing attitudes of condescension and sentimentality.‚Äù \\"The Cotton Pickers\\" is considered to be Homer's most outstanding painting depicting the post-war period. In 1876, the year the painting was made, Federal troops were being withdrawn from the South as Reconstruction came to an end. During this period, the focus of the Federal Government shifted from aiding its vulnerable new citizens, to helping rich industrialists fight labor unions. In the post-war years preceding ‚ÄúThe Cotton Pickers,‚Äù African- Americans had hopes of vast improvements in their lives. This optimism, however, was short lived, as continued racism and a harsher form of black codes, the Jim Crow Laws would soon be implemented. Description In \\"The Cotton Pickers\\", Homer employs a palette of browns and silvery grays on a canvas that measures approximately 24 by 38 inches. The piece offers a realistic view of two female \\"slave-like\\" workers. The women are presented from a low vantage point, filling the canvas and dominating the composition. They are dressed in humble clothing, cotton blouses and long skirts. The colors are blurred and dim with little contrast in shadow and texture, except for the background which appears much lighter than the women. The darker colors with which the pair are painted establish the work's entire atmosphere. Judging by the light, the scene is set in early morning. As the women have nearly filled their basket and sack, they have probably been working since before dawn. Both are silent with vivid expressions. The painter renders the pair with a combination of black and white physical characteristics. Neither woman is picking cotton. The unhappy one on the left, holding a bushel basket, stoops to brush a plant with her hand. The woman on the right, gunny sack slug across her shoulder, stands erect gazing into the distance, a poignant image of inner life and aspiration. Her demeanor might be interpreted as one of defiance or hatred. While the figures are painted as powerful and heroic, they are also portrayed as individuals. Far into the distance, Homer places a low blue-green mountain range bordered on the left by a forest and on the right by a single pine rising high above the pale field. Analysis Homer's contemporaries praised the artist as the first to see the possibilities of untapped subject matter. In contrast to the caricatures painted of African Americans during and after the Civil War, Homer's representation of rural workers in heroic terms drew upon a popular European style of the time. These elements are well represented in the work of French artists Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and Jules Breton. Homer similarly portrayed his laborers with respect and sympathy as graceful majestic figures, as well as unmistakably American subjects. \\"The Cotton Pickers\\" has been called \\"the artist‚Äôs most monumental painting of the figure; that it should also be of African American subjects is remarkable.\\" The women's slavery past is imprinted on their faces as is their future in an inevitable cycle of labor. Though the master-slave relationship was undone by the Emancipation Proclamation, slave-holding ideologies remained intact for many more years. The vast expanse of land portrayed in \\"The Cotton Pickers\\" is likely part of a large farm or plantation, indicating that the two figures are common wage laborers. No progress from the women‚Äôs labor is visible, although their basket and sack are full. The boundless nature of the field suggests that the work will never be finished. To emphasize the concept of a never-ending endeavor, Homer places the cotton plants so the viewer cannot see the laborers‚Äô legs, providing an illusion that the pair are unable to move or escape from bondage. The field hands are isolated in terms of color, which suggests their isolation in life. The foreground color is dense and heightened, while the background is much lighter and less intensified. The background is perceived as light and weightless, against which the darkly- painted laborers are viewed as still bound to the epoch of slavery. Despite this, the women give the impression of looking forward with thoughtfulness and determination. They stand erect, emanating the force of will to handle their difficult circumstances. In painting the background, Homer may even offer the promise of a better future. From left to right, the horizon progresses from a single tree to a forest, which might be interpreted as \\"one hope turning into a unified force of change.\\" According to a contemporary art historian, by depicting the women as mulattoes with characteristic Caucasian features such as light skin and fine facial bone structure, Homer indicates they are of mixed race parentage. Increase in the mulatto population from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century resulted from the sexual abuse of enslaved black women by their Southern planter masters. \\"The Cotton Pickers\\" presumes the women's fathers were white plantation owners. During Homer's time, mixed- blood heritage was thought to be an obstacle to black Americans' advancement. Individuals fearful of threats to white racial purity theorized that mulattos were \\"doomed to biological eradication and could not reproduce beyond a few generations.\\" Unable to sustain this heritage, \\"the mulatto would be denied a place in America‚Äôs future\\" and the world of the powerless mixed-race individual would be one in which major change for the black community could never occur. Homer's portrayal of the women as mulattoes may characterize them as having limited potential for successful futures. Reality, however, often proved quite different. Because many mulattos were born to wealthy white fathers, they often received special treatment both within the black community and from slave holding relatives. A fellow scholar and critic concludes that in \\"The Cotton Pickers\\", \\"Homer creates a gap between the specificity of the realistic details and the mysterious evocativeness of the expressions and oblique glances that makes the uneasy relationship of consciousness to ordinary life the subject of the painting.\\" His figures \\"look out of the frame space, beyond the physical world defined by their paintings... beckoning the \\"viewer to look beyond social valuations and depictions...to an appreciation of an intangible, gentle sublimity in which the individual consciousness participates, separated from the group or the social task at hand and not communicable in effects of light and color.\\" The result is a conception of the individual as in some sense 'all dressed up with no place to go' with a consciousness that potentially will not be expressed or translated into worldly roles, actions, or identities.\\" Provenance \\"The Cotton Pickers\\" was first exhibited in 1877 at the Century Club, where Homer was a member. The painting was well received. At the initial showing, it was purchased by a wealthy cotton spinner who took the painting to England. For years, the work was relatively unknown in America. From 1911 to 1944, the piece was owned by Dr. Charles B. Guinn of Carthage, Missouri. Wildenstein & Co. held the painting from 1944 to 1947, at which time it was sold to James Cox Bandy II. Upon his death, Bandy's wife inherited the work and held it until 1977. LACMA acquired the painting in the same year.

The satellite was launched piggyback with three United States Air Force satellites on a Titan IIIC launch vehicle. The satellite was regular tetrahedron, 48 cm on each side. It had four independent monopole antennas and like OSCAR 3 contained a tracking beacon transmitter and a communications repeater. It was powered by a solar cell array and batteries. The launch vehicle suffered a partial failure and placed OSCAR IV in an unplanned 161 km √ó 33000-km orbit preventing the planned coverage. OSCAR IV was built by the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California. It had a 3 watt 10 kHz wide linear transponder (144 MHz uplink and 432 MHz downlink). The satellite remained in operation for 85 days, until March 16, 1966. The satellite eventually re-entered Earth's atmosphere on April 12, 1976. Only 12 two-way communications were established through the linear transponder, but one on December 22, 1965 was the first direct satellite communication between the United States and the USSR. Project OSCAR Project OSCAR Inc. started in 1960 with the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California and radio amateurs who worked at TRW and other California defense companies, to investigate the possibility of putting an amateur satellite in orbit. Project OSCAR was responsible for the construction of the first Amateur Radio Satellite OSCAR-1, that was successfully launched from Vandenberg AFB in California . OSCAR 1 orbited the earth for 22 days, transmitting the ‚ÄúHI‚Äù greeting you see in Morse Code above. Project OSCAR was responsible for launching of 3 other amateur radio satellites during the 1960s: OSCAR 1, OSCAR 2, and OSCAR 3. In 1969, AMSAT-NA was founded by radio amateurs working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the Baltimore-Washington DC region, to continue the efforts begun by Project OSCAR. Its first project was to coordinate the launch of Australis-OSCAR 5, constructed by students at the University of Melbourne. Today, over fifty years later, Project OSCAR still exists as part of the San Jose (CA) Amateur Radio Club. Its mission is ‚ÄúTo initiate and support activities that promote the Satellite Amateur Radio Hobby‚Äù. The primary goal is to reach out and provide logistical support, training and in some cases equipment to amateur radio associations, schools and the public at large. Firsts Oscar IV was the first attempt for a High Earth Orbit (HEO) or GeoStationary Earth Orbit (GEO) amateur radio satellite, later categorized by AMSAT as Phase 3 and Phase 4. Improvements included: * First higher power (3 Watt) 10 kHz wide linear transponder (144 MHz uplink and 432 MHz downlink), due to higher planned orbit. * First direct satellite communication between the United States and the USSR. * Successful development of innovative workaround procedures for satellite usage, based on launch vehicle partial failure.

His current research focuses on the distribution of determinants of human behaviour between the physical space, mental space, and social space. He has published a book on this topic, entitled \\"Installation Theory: The Societal Construction and Regulation of Behaviour\\".http://www.cambridge.org/installationtheory This work provides researchers and practitioners with a simple and powerful framework to understand, analyse, and change behaviour. Informed by a wide range of empirical evidence, it includes an accessible synthesis of former theories (ecological psychology, activity theory, situated action, distributed cognition, social constructionism, actor-network theory and social representations). Lahlou's work defines \\"installations\\" as the familiar, socially constructed, apparatuses which elicit, enable, scaffold and control - and make predictable - most of our 'normal' behaviour. From shower-cabins or airport check-ins to family dinners, classes or hospitals. Installations consist of a set of components that simultaneously support and socially control individual behaviour. Installation Theory describes their threefold structure with a model enabling systematic and practical analysis of their components The components are distributed over the physical space (affordances), the subject (embodied competences) and the social space (institutions, enacted and enforced by other subjects). These components assemble at the time and place the activity is performed. Installation Theory details the mechanisms of their construction, resilience and evolution. Installation Theory is designed to inform intervention on social systems for behavioural change and business model betterment.‚Äù  Publications  Books and special issues by Saadi Lahlou * (2017) LAHLOU, S., Installation Theory.

The goal is to establish in Berlin-Dahlem, a site with a strong history in plant science research, an internationally visible plant science centre, including the Botanical Garden Berlin-Dahlem, one of the world's largest botanical gardens and collections. The Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences covers a wide spectrum of plant science disciplines, provides a platform for interdisciplinary collaborative research initiatives and supports a variety of outreach activities. Members of the Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences are involved in teaching plant biology at different levels including programs for the general public.  Idea and Vision  The Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences is a new modern centre for plant sciences at Freie Universit√§t Berlin. As a Freie Universit√§t Berlin research focus area, it is supported by funds from the university‚Äôs future development strategy (International Network University) that proved so successful in the Excellence Initiative launched by the federal and L√§nder governments. The Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences brings together different research areas, largely separately previously, and provides them with a platform to open up new research fields. It comprises a wide spectrum of plant sciences including molecular and cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, plant physiology, developmental biology, systematics and taxonomy, plant geography, ecology and pharmaceutical biology. Founding the Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences in June 2009 implemented a close and productive cooperation between these disciplines. The Berlin-Dahlem location was already the site of an internationally renowned plant science centre in the early 1900s. The centre is building on this historical foundation. Research aims to play its part in a comprehensive understanding of plant diversity, preserving that diversity and facilitating the sustainable use of plant resources. Since sustainability is also a main concern in promoting the new generation of scientists in this area, the Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences sets out to promote young scholars and researchers as they start their career. At present, seven independent groups of young scientists are conducting research here. Doctoral students currently can study at the Plant Sciences graduate school under the umbrella of the Dahlem Research School. One of the key objectives is to create and leverage synergies. The concentration of resources in research and collections in the southwest of Berlin is unique throughout Germany. As a result, the Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences is also an important hub for plant research networked on the regional, national and international levels. Through the links between research groups with an organismic orientation and those working in molecular biology, as well as partner institution cooperations in the region and across the world, the Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences is set to become a centre with a strong national and international profile.  Main Research Areas DCPS focuses on two scientific leitmotifs: ‚ÄúFunction and Diversity‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlant and Environment‚Äù. The research findings from both areas are transferred to practices supporting sustainable use and the protection of plant diversity. Here, the spectrum ranges from the development of genetic resources (Applied Plant Sciences) to the management of varied eco-systems. Public relations and communication tools are also used to present the findings in a more accessible form to a broader audience. Function and Diversity research aims to produce new insights into the evolutionary development of the morphological and functional diversity of plants. The evolution of new traits and the mechanisms of genome evolutions are studied by combining comparative genomics with phylogenetic, biochemical and molecular techniques. The topics addressed include the evolution and function of signal transfer processes in plant cells, the role of the numerous plant secondary metabolites, the uptake and utilization of nutrients as well as the development of morphological features. This work is based on the rapidly growing information available from genome sequencing. In the meantime this goes far beyond the model plant Arabidopsis, previously the focus of much research, and opens up numerous approaches capable of contributing to a better understanding of gene functions and the evolution of biological diversity. The close links to the newly established Berlin Consortium for Genomics in Biodiversity Research play a significant role in research into genome sequence and structure. In the Plant and Environment field of research, the focus is on plant functions and adaptive reactions in the context of constantly changing environmental conditions. This complex topic requires a transdisciplinary approach to understand the context (phylogeny, plant geography, ecology) as well as the mechanisms (physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology). Together with its regional partners, the Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences covers the broad spectrum of expertise required here. The research concentrates on plant reactions to such abiotic stress factors as light intensity, extremes of temperature, lack of water and nutrients, as well as plant biotic interactions with other organisms, for example, insects or fungi. The research groups are working on such diverse themes as, for instance, the responses of plants to pathogens, plants‚Äô cellular memory for environmental stress, the role of root architecture in fungi colonisation and its significance for crop yields and the mechanisms of neighbouring plants to communicate with each other.  Structure and Networking  The core of the DCPS is built around plant scientists at the Institute of Biology and the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum, which is part of Freie Universit√§t Berlin‚Äôs Central Services, as well as the pharmaceutical biology research groups from the Institute of Pharmacy. These different fields of study are all located on Freie Universit√§t‚Äôs campus in Berlin-Dahlem. Since Freie Universit√§t Berlin also has experts from many different fields, interdisciplinary cooperation projects can be established in a straightforward way. For example, when implementing research projects on environmental themes, it is essential to include geoscientists, legal specialists and political scientists. Computer scientists and mathematicians are vital in effectively processing the vast amounts of data available. Complex issues and facts to be disseminated to a broad audience are prepared together with specialists in education and teaching methodology.

The phase plug is shown in dark purple. In a loudspeaker, a phase plug, phasing plug or acoustical transformer is a mechanical interface between a speaker driver and the audience. The phase plug extends high frequency response because it guides waves outward toward the listener rather than allowing them to interact destructively near the driver. Phase plugs are commonly found in high-powered horn loudspeakers used in professional audio, in the mid- and high-frequency bandpasses, positioned between the compression driver diaphragm and the acoustic horn. They may also be present in front of woofer cones in some loudspeaker designs. In each case they serve to equalize sound wave path lengths from the driver to the listener, to prevent cancellations and frequency response problems. The phase plug can be considered a further narrowing of the horn throat, becoming an extension of the horn to the surface of the diaphragm. History An electromechanical driver of the sort later used in loudspeakers was invented by German industrialist Werner von Siemens in 1877 but no practical amplification existed to create the loudspeaker until 1921. Various loudspeaker designs were produced in the 1920s, including General Electric engineers Chester W. Rice and Edward W. Kellogg mating an acoustic horn to the speaker driver in 1925. In 1926, Bell System engineers Albert L. Thuras and Edward C. Wente modified the horn loudspeaker by inserting the first phase plug between the driver and the horn. This phase plug directed sound waves into the horn throat from the center of the diaphragm and from a ring around the perimeter of the diaphragm, by way of center hole and annular slot, for the purpose of improving \\"the transmission characteristics\\" of the loudspeaker \\"at the upper portion of the sound frequency range.\\" \\"Acoustic Device\\". Edward C. Wente, assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories. Applied for on August 4, 1926. Patent awarded on April 2, 1929. Based on their joint research, the two engineers were awarded consecutive U.S. patents: Thuras filed a patent for a novel electrodynamic diaphragm design, and Wente filed a patent for the first phase plug. \\"Electrodynamic Device\\". Albert L. Thuras, assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories. Applied for on August 4, 1926. Patent awarded on April 2, 1929. The principles laid out by Thuras and Wente have influenced every subsequent phase plug design. Compression drivers Two types of dome-type phase plug: one with radial slits and one with concentric ring slits, also called annular or circumferential In horn loudspeakers, the phase plug serves to carry sound waves out from all areas of the compression driver diaphragm through the compression chamber to the horn throat such that each pulse of sound reaches the throat as one coherent wave front. With a successful implementation, high-frequency performance is extended higher. The phase plug is a complex and expensive element of the compression driver. Its manufacture requires fine tolerances. Phase plugs are machined in metals such as aluminum, or cast in hard plastic or Bakelite. Meyer Sound Laboratories chose a lightweight plastic because of its resistance to temperature and humidity. Many variations exist in phase plug design, but two types have evolved to match two major diaphragm types: dome and ring. Dome-based diaphragms are similar to the 1920s Thuras/Wente patents, and are still in common use today. Phase plugs that interface with dome-type diaphragms include a wide variety: designs with radial slots, designs with concentric annular ring slots, and hybrid designs with a combination of annular and radial slots. Altec engineer Clifford A. Henricksen reported on the differences between radial and \\"circumferential\\" types of phase plugs at Audio Engineering Society conventions in 1976 and 1978. The radial design is easier to produce, but it does not differentiate between sound waves from the perimeter of the diaphragm and sound waves from the center. At high frequencies, the diaphragm does not act as a perfect piston; instead, it displays rippling, modal properties related to its stiffness and density. Because of the speed of wave propagation through the diaphragm material, the center of the diaphragm moves slightly later than the perimeter. Radial slots in the phase plug do not correct for this small time difference, which affects the highest frequencies. Concentric circular slots may be able to correct for the diaphragm's rippling behavior but the positioning of the slots is critical. Circular slots may allow resonances to build up between the diaphragm and the phase plug‚Äîresonances which cause wave cancellations and a corresponding reduction in frequency response at the resonance frequency. The less common ring diaphragm is a later development intended to minimize the problems related to wave propagation through the diaphragm material. This design requires a radically different shape of phase plug, but radial slots and concentric rings may still play a part. The combined area of the phase plug slots is typically about one-eighth to one-tenth of the area of the diaphragm. This gives a pressure-to-volume velocity change ratio in the range of 8:1 to 10:1, which serves to match the impedance of the diaphragm to the horn throat. A larger slot area admits more sound wave energy but also reflects more energy backward onto the diaphragm. A smaller slot area traps more wave energy between the phase plug and the diaphragm. In researching the diaphragm/phase plug interface, David Gunness found that only half the wave energy, at best, travels directly from the diaphragm through the phase plug slots and out to the listener. The other half (or more) causes cancellations within the space between the diaphragm and the phase plug, or causes temporal anomalies (time smear) upon leaving the phase plug later than the direct sound. To minimize the problem, Gunness modeled the behavior mathematically and used digital signal processing to apply a polarity-reversed version of the undesired wave behavior to the original audio signal. Hosted by EAW.com Woofers Horn-loaded woofer showing a phase plug in black Phase plugs may be placed in front of woofer cones, especially in horn-loaded loudspeaker designs. In the same fashion as compression driver phase plugs, the intent is to minimize higher-frequency wave interference near the driver. In this case, \\"high frequency\\" is relative to the intended bandpass; for example, a cone woofer might be expected to reproduce 550 Hz energy near the top of its intended range, however, the wavelength of 550 Hz is approximately twice the diameter of the woofer, so wave energy at that frequency traveling laterally from one side to the other will be out of phase and will cancel. With a phase plug in the center, such lateral wave energy bounces off of the obstruction and is reflected outward toward the listener. Phase plugs for woofer cones are typically solid plugs positioned over the woofer's central dust cap, or in the center of the woofer, replacing the dust cap.

Since it was established in 1850 as a cattle market, the fair and the fairground in which it is held have become popular attractions for the people of Algeciras and the surrounding towns of the Campo de Gibraltar. It has moved several times since its establishment and is now held in the Las Colinas area, where Algeciras's Las Palomas bullring is also located. History Poster advertising the first fair, held in 1850 Roundabout of the Tambourine outside the fairground, representing the 1945 fair The Royal Fair was established under a royal warrant in June 1850 as a cattle show held in the area known as El Calvario, to the north of the city in the direction of San Roque. The area was devoid of buildings at the time and was the starting point of a popular pilgrimage known as Los Pinos. According to the poster and various contemporary writers, the first fair included fireworks, ship regattas, horse performances and even a bullfight called the toro de la veta, which was banned a few years later. In addition to the entertainments and the cattle show, goods and craftworks from all parts of the Campo de Gibraltar could be bought at the fair. The fair soon became very popular both in the city and neighboring towns. Some of the temporary stalls erected for the annual show became permanent fixtures, which citizens of Algeciras visited on summer evenings. Seven years after the first fair was held, Algeciras's first permanent bullring was constructed in its vicinity but had to be torn down after a few years because of problems with its construction. The La Perseverancia bullring was built to replace it in 1866. In 1877 a promenade called the Alameda de la Feria was constructed and had to be extended in 1914 to accommodate the number of people using it.Delgado G√≥mez (2003), p. 188Delgado G√≥mez (1989), p. 127 The site of the fair was moved in 1957 to a field north of the Parque Mar√≠a Cristina, due to pressure from development on its former location in El Calvario. The fairground was entered through the park grounds, which were illuminated at night to facilitate drivers and horse riders. Current fairground In 1967, the Royal Fair moved again, once more due to the demands on land in Algeciras, to a then-undeveloped area on the outskirts of the city next to the Carretera de M√°laga, in the area called Las Colinas. The old fairground was completely built over, as was a large part of the park, which had the Avenida de Francisco Franco (now the Avenida de las Fuerzas Armadas) built across its western side.Torremocha Silva (1985), p. 431 The new Las Palomas bullring was built adjacent to the fairground in 1967; it would eventually replace La Perseverancia, which was demolished in 1976. The fair's new location was heavily criticised at the time, as it was thought by many to be too far from the city, but the continued expansion of Algeciras has meant that it is now surrounded by built-up areas within the city limits.Delgado G√≥mez (1989), p. 76 The fair is regarded as the most important festival in the area and, according to the mayor of Algeciras, is \\"a landmark not only in the Campo de Gibraltar, but in [the whole of] Andalusia\\". It is normally held over ten days in June with one of its days being a local holiday. Due to the city's economic problems, the 2013 fair was three days shorter than usual as a cost-cutting measure.

Early life and education Nazih was born in Tabriz in 1921. However, there is another report giving his birth year as 1920. He held a law degree, which he received from the University of Tehran in 1944. Until 1953 he attended the University of Geneva for doctoral study in law, but he returned to Iran without completing his study. Political activities and career After graduation Nazih served as a judge in Iran for four years before pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Geneva which he did not complete, and therefore, he returned to Iran in 1953. He was one of the central council members of the National Resistance Movement and a supporter of then prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh during the 1950s. He joined the foundation of the Liberation Movement of Iran or Freedom Movement, which was led by Mahdi Bazargan, in 1961. Nazih founded the Association of Iranian Jurists and served as its director from 1966 to 1978. He was one of the lawyers of Seyyed Mahmoud Taleghani together with Ahmad Sayyed Javadi in 1977. The same year Nazih significantly contributed to the formation of the Iranian Committee for the Defense of Freedom and Human Rights. He was also among the prominent figures who supported the 1979 revolution. However, he did not support the Assembly of Experts that drafted Iran's new constitution. On the other hand, he was appointed by then prime minister Mahdi Bazargan as head of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) on 17 February 1979. Nazih was a critic of Ayatollah Khomenei and stated on 28 May that the Ayatollah's remarks on labelling on those who opposed to the religious leadership enemies of the revolution were not acceptable. The members of the Revolutionary Council, Mohammad Beheshti and Mohammad Mofatteh, argued that since Nazih criticised Khomeini with this statement, he should be sacked. In addition, Ayatollah Khomeini's son-in-law Shahabuddin Eshraqi initiated a campaign against him in July 1979. They accused Nazih of being a CIA agent. On 28 September 1979, Nazih was relieved from office by prime minister and also, forced underground. Nazih announced that he wanted to be tried by a panel, including Mahdi Bazargan and Khomeini. Ali Akbar Moinfar, who would also become the first oil minister, succeeded Nazih as the head of the NIOC. Later the case against Nazih was dropped by the prosecution. Exile Nazih fled Iran and settled in France in autumn 1979, and there he took refuge. He also left the Freedom Movement in 1979. In exile, he formed the Front for the National Sovereignty of Iran in 1983. Later he headed the Council for the Preparation of a Transition Government in Iran, which had been formed in Germany in 1992. The group launched a publication with the editorship of Nazih in Germany. Death In his later years, Nazih suffered from Alzheimer's disease and died in Paris in September 2012.

Common names include alpine bur cucumber,Sicyos macrophyllus. USDA Plants Profile. largeleaf bur-cucumber, and 'anunu.Sicyos macrophyllus. USFWS Species Assessment and Listing Priority Assignment Form. This is a perennial herb producing vines up to 15 meters long and 4 centimeters thick. They are supported with tendrils. The stems are slightly hairy and have black spots. The leaves are lobed. They are hairless on the upper surface and hairy underneath. The flowers are greenish yellow and the fruit is round. This plant can be found on the island of Hawaii at elevations between 1200 and 2000 meters. It lives in wet  ª≈çhi ªa lehua- dominated forest and subalpine forests dominated by mƒÅmane and naio. It occurs in Hawai ªi Volcanoes National Park. There are approximately 24 to 26 individuals of this species in existence. It is not a federally listed endangered or threatened species, but the United States government made it a candidate for protection in 1990. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service considers the plant \\"highly threatened\\" and the threats are considered \\"imminent\\". However, it does not consider emergency listing necessary as of 2010. Habitat destruction is a main cause of the species' decline. Feral pigs, sheep, and cattle destroy native plants and cause erosion of the hilly habitat. They are also vectors for the seeds of introduced species of plants, including several types of noxious weed. Cattle will also consume S. macrophyllus directly. Another threat to the species is competition from alien plant species. The worst offenders are fountain grass, kikuyu grass, and German ivy. Alien species smother other vegetation, compete for resources, pose a fire hazard, and prevent the establishment of other species' seedlings. Some even release allelopathic chemicals that prevent other plants from growing. The National Park Service is attempting to prevent the extinction of this species. It has erected fences around some of the few individuals that survive today. It also tries to control invasive plants. The National Tropical Botanical Garden has some seed samples.

The wood frame school was built in 1928 to serve Benton County School District 105. The school served the rural area around the Glade community; it was built during a period of economic transition for the area, which had historically been an orchard farming community but was turning to grain farming and animal husbandry. In the 1960s, the creation of Beaver Lake separated the school from areas across the White River. The origin of Coal Gap School is unknown but the Benton County school supervisor's office records indicated that directors are listed as early as 1887. Land for the school was given for the price of one dollar by Edd Jennings to be used as a school, according to courthouse deeds. Years ago, a two-story version, was moved several yards south where it became a barn. The second floor never became the lodge that was intended. On January 20, 1949, both Coal Gap and Garfield agreed to dissolve Coal Gap School District No. 105 and annex it to the Garfield School District No. 114. Less than two months later, on March 5, 1949, the Garfield School District was dissolved and annexed to Rogers School District No. 30. Junior and senior high students from Glade and Garfield were to be bused into Rogers and the elementary grades remained in Garfield Schools. The school house was the center of the community and with its closing, students traveled through Prairie Creek to go to Rogers Schools, but as Beaver Lake rose the route was changed and the students rode to Garfield and then to Rogers to attend school. Because it was so far, the students were dismissed an hour early to make the long trip home. Coal Gap School was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1992.

Plot  Michael Williams, a documentary filmmaker for the BBC, is working on a project involving depictions of Satan and demonic-inspired deaths in works of art. His wife perished in what was ruled an accidental fire, and he now raises his preadolescent daughter, Emily, with assistance from a devoted governess, Jill, both of whom are still haunted by the death. Michael's obsession with a specific painting sends him to Italy, and his family doctor suggests he take his daughter and governess along to help them recover. While packing for the trip, Emily finds a medallion that he had bought for his wife on a previous trip, and in turn he allows her to keep it. On arriving in Italy, they are met by American production manager Joanna, who soon becomes romantically drawn to Michael. When Michael meets with art historian and self-professed psychic Countess Cappelli, she begs him to not inquire further about the painting, but to no avail. After an initial shoot at an abandoned gallery where the painting resides, the developed film shows what seems to be an ectoplasmic presence the crew had not seen when they shot it. When Michael and Joanna return late at night to figure out why this happens, Emily has a nightmare of them in danger, and concurrent with her hysterics, a statue falls, almost killing the couple; the rubble reveals a double-edged sword and a duplicate of the medallion Emily wears, previously hidden inside. Emily's behavior in general becomes more unpredictable, such as taking up smoking and playing piano when she previously had little skill, and unpleasant, particularly towards Joanna. The Countess warns of danger to everyone based on these discoveries and a tarot reading, but Michael dismisses her worry. Joanna, sensing that governess Jill has also harbored feelings for Michael, tries to foster conviviality by taking everyone out for an afternoon of play in a cliffside park. The initially pleasant outing turns tragic when an unseen assailant pushes Jill off the cliff to her death in rapid water below. Michael and Emily return to England for Jill's funeral, with the Countess begging them not to return. Emily also asks not to be taken back to Italy, but Michael is intent on finishing his documentary and solving the mystery of the painting. In their absence, the Countess returns to the gallery and discovers someone has painted over elements of the painting that revealed a young girl resembling Emily possessing the sword and the medallion, and has a vision of Michael pounding on the doors of the gallery. She also has a vision of a girl from another time playing piano, and hiding letters in its body. She uncovers an abandoned piano, and finds the letters still there. Returning to Italy, Michael asks Joanna to stay with them to keep watch on Emily. He meets with the Countess once more, and she shows him the letters, which detail how the girl in her vision, named Emilia, succumbed to a demonic possession and killed her family. She urges him to get to Emily if he hopes to save her. Meanwhile, Emily, in full throes of a possession spurred by the medallion, tries to kill Joanna by starting a fire in her bedroom with heating oil. Michael arrives in time to stop the fire, but Emily runs off during his save of Joanna. Emily gets into the gallery, and is horrified to discover that it is she who is responsible for the death of both her governess and her mother; she takes the sword and stabs the painting in manic terror. Michael finds her, and Emily runs to embrace him, seemingly unaware she holds the double-edged sword, which kills both of them.

The work lasted for over a year. After all delays and scandals, including clashes between the lawmakers, on June 27, 1996, Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz offered to work without breaks until full adoption. Having spent almost 24 hours in continuous work in the session hall, Ukrainian lawmakers eventually passed the document with 315 votes in its favor. The centuries of people's lawmaking predated the Constitution of Ukraine in its current form. There was the Russkaya Pravda, the legal code of Kyivan Rus, the Cossack and hetman constitutions, including the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk (one of the first constitutional documents in Europe), the Constitution of the Ukrainian State of 1918. The effective Basic Law of Ukraine has been amended several times. The adoption of the Constitution in 1996 marked the beginning of the formation and development of Ukraine as a new democratic and independent state.

In 1913 he undertook musical studies at the Conservatoire de Paris under teachers Andr√© Gedalge and Eug√®ne Cools, from whom he learned counterpoint and fugue, before taking up composition studies with Charles Koechlin, who had taught such diverse musicians as Poulenc, Milhaud (members of the group Les Six) and Cole Porter. He obtained a position as director of vocal studies at the school in Cannes, later transferring to Deauville, and finally to Aix-les-Bains. In 1923 he co-founded the School of Arcueil, with fellow musicians, Henri Sauguet, Maxime Jacob, and Roger D√©sormi√®re. The four were devotees of the music of Erik Satie, who was living in Arcueil at the time. The musicians of this group dedicated themselves to the musical goals of clarity, simplicity, and a commitment to French musical tradition, including French humor, which they felt was typified by Satie's music. The group was short-lived, and did not long survive Satie's death in 1925.

She belonged to the pioneer generation of the first public theatre in Norway, the theatre of Christiania Offentlige Theater in Oslo in 1827. She is the first Norwegian actress known by name of this theatre, the first in Norway and thereby also the first professional native actress of her country. Life Erike Kirstine Kolstad was the daughter of the procurator Erich Kolstad and Birgitha Maria Walseth. She married the actor Poul Jensen Boiflin (1797-1841) in 1829. Kolstad reportedly made her debut at the stage of the carpenters guild in Trondheim. On 30 January 1827, the first professional theatre, the Str√∂mberg Theatre, was inaugurated by Johan Peter Str√∂mberg in Oslo. Str√∂mberg, an actor from Sweden, had the ambition to create native Norwegian actors in a country where theatre until then had been performed only by travelling foreign theatre companies, and his theatre was inaugurated by a ballet performed by the Norwegian dancers Henriette Hansen and Andrine (Randine) Christensen, followed by the play Hustrun, translated from Die deutsche Hausfrau by August von Kotzebue, where the main roles were performed by Kolstad and Poul Jensen Boiflin. Kolstad and Boiflin are described as the leading actors of the theatre during its very first years. She was described as a talented comedy actor and a soubrette. Kolstad was engaged at the theatre until her death in 1830. After these very first years, however, the theatre's staff was mainly composed of Danes until the 1850s.

Life Born at Florence into a noble local Ghibelline family, he was appointed Archbishop of Bologna in 1240, but the appointment was not confirmed since he was considered too young. On 28 May 1244, he was made a cardinal by pope Innocent IV, with the titulus of Santa Maria in Via Lata. He exerted a major role within the Roman Curia, as it was important in his action against Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in favour of the Guelph cause. As bishop of Bologna, he commanded the Guelph army of the Bolognese and their allies against the Ghibelline cities of lower Lombardy, roughly corresponding to present day Emilia-Romagna. After Frederick's defeat at Parma on 18 February 1248, Ottaviano was ordered by pope Innocent IV to recapture the papal possessions in the Po valley. This mission proved difficult, however, as Ottaviano did not have enough money to pay an army - he thus sought help from local forces, but Guelphism in the Romagna was not yet sufficiently organised. The cardinal thus turned to Bologna, a city with a solid Guelph tradition. The army led by Ubaldini succeeded in recapturing all the cities in Romagna from Imola to Rimini for the Papal States between May and June 1248, forcing even Ghibelline Forl√¨ to recognise the papal legate. At the battle of Fossalta (26 May 1249) the cardinal captured Frederick's son Enzo of Sardinia, whom he imprisoned in the Palazzo Re Enzo in Bologna. In 1251, following a seriously- damaging Florentine attack on the family castle at Montaccianico near Sant'Agata Mugello, Ottaviano decided to rebuild it bigger and stronger, with two curtain walls more than three metres thick in places, as shown by recent archaeological digs in the \\"Montaccianico Vive\\" project. In July 1258, Manfredi supported Ottaviano's attempted Ghibelline coup in Florence.Re Di Sicilia Manfredi in Dizionario Biografico ‚Äì Treccani Between 1268 and 1271 he took part in the famously long Viterbo conclave, which finally led to the election of pope Gregory X. His nephew was archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini. Contemporary writers indicate Ottaviano was a strong supporter of the Ghibelline cause - he said of himself \\"I can say, if I had a soul, I lost it for the Ghibellines\\". For this Dante Alighieri places Ottaviano in the Epicurean (i.e. atheist) circle of hell, alongside Farinata degli Uberti and Frederick.

She belonged to the pioneer generation of the first public theatre in Norway, the theatre of Christiania Offentlige Theater in Oslo in 1827. This being the first public stage in Norway, she may be regarded as the first native professional ballet dancer in Norway: the first ballet dancer in Norway was likely the foreign born Christina Doreothea Stuart. Biography Henriette Hansen was born in Christiania, (now Oslo), Norway. She was the daughter of tradesman Christopher Hansen and Gunhild Jensdatter. In Norway, professional theatre was long managed by travelling theatre companies from Denmark and Sweden. In 1827, the first public theatre, which was to be the Christiania Theater, was opened in Oslo by the Swedish actor Johan Peter Str√∂mberg (1773‚Äì1834). Str√∂mberg had the ambition to create Norwegian actors. On the inauguration of the Str√∂mberg theatre on 30 January 1827, a ballet was performed by the Norwegian dancers Henriette Hansen and Andrine (Randine) Christensen, who were described as the foster children of Str√∂mberg, followed by the play Hustrun, translated from Die deutsche Hausfrau by German dramatist August von Kotzebue (1761‚Äì1819). The main parts is believed to have been played by Erike Kirstine Kolstad (1792-1830), and her colleague Boiflin. Henriette Hansen was given very good critic for her talents both within singing, dancing and acting. However, she left the stage in 1831 after her marriage to dramatist and judge Henrik Anker Bjerregaard (1831‚Äì1842).

He had a long and prestigious naval career, gaining his own command by the last stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. He took part in a number of famous naval battles during his career, such as the Battle of the Saintes, the Glorious First of June and the Battle of Tory Island, where he received the sword of the French commodore, Jean Bompart. His record also includes extensive operations in the West Indies and the Baltic Sea, followed by the expedition to New Orleans in 1815.  Early life and service during the American Revolutionary War  French ship C√©sar blows up at the Battle of the Saintes. Charles Dashwood was born on 1 September 1765 in Vallon Wood, Somerset, England, where his family resided for three hundred years. His father was Mr. Robert Dashwood and his mother was Hon. Mary Sweeting. He was baptized on the day of his birth at Bicknoller.Marshall, p.450 At the age of thirteen, Dashwood entered the Royal Navy, being appointed as a midshipman on 9 January 1779, and embarking on board the 74-gun ship HMS Courageux, commanded by Captain Lord Mulgrave.O'Byrne, p.263 After serving some time with the Channel Fleet, from March 1780 to January 1782 he embarked successively on board the frigate HMS Southampton and on HMS Grafton, both under the orders of Captain Garnier, under whom he witnessed the Action of 9 August 1780, where the Southampton narrowly escaped to a Franco-Spanish fleet. Returning from Jamaica to England with Garnier in the Grafton, he embarked on board HMS Formidable, flagship of Sir George Rodney, acting as aide-de-camp during the Battle of the Saintes, where the French fleet was beaten thanks to the innovative tactic of \\"breaking the line\\", giving Britain a weapon to wield at the Treaty of Versailles, and restoring the status quo that the British had in the West Indies to that of 1776. An eyewitness account of the battle was written by him.Valin, pp.93‚Äì97 During the heat of the battle, Rodney asked Dashwood to make him a glass of lemonade, the ingredients for which were at hand. Not having anything to stir it with but a knife that was already discoloured by the cutting of the lemon, George Rodney said, on Dashwood presenting it to him: \\"Child, that may do for a midshipman, but not for an admiral. Take it yourself and send my servant to me.\\"Marshall, p.451  French Revolutionary Wars  After the American Revolutionary War, Dashwood was employed as master's mate on board the sloop HMS Cygnet until he was sent to the 50-gun fourth-rate HMS Bristol. He served on the latter until she was put out of commission in 1786. After being paid off in 1787, Dashwood joined the packet-service at Falmouth, where he remained for two years. Shortly afterwards he was appointed commander of a merchant vessel, cruising between London and Jamaica until the renewal of hostilities against the French Republic in 1793. HMS Brunswick fighting Achille and Vengeur du Peuple simultaneously at the Battle of the Glorious 1 June 1794, by Nicholas Pocock. In early March 1794, he was appointed as a junior lieutenant aboard HMS Impregnable, flagship of Rear-Admirals Benjamin Caldwell and Andrew Mitchell. He distinguished himself in the Glorious First of June, at which British Admiral Richard Howe attempted to destroy a large French fleet protecting a convoy. The convoy escaped the British, but seven French ships were taken and the rest driven back to France. Impregnable was heavily engaged in the action and suffered severe damage. During the course of the engagement, Dashwood had to lash the fore top-sail yard which had been shot in the slings, to the cap, whereby the ship was enabled to wear in pursuit of the enemy.James & Chamier, p. 159 For this action he was promoted, on 20 June 1794, to the rank of full lieutenant. Dashwood's next appointments were from 13 August 1796 to late 1798; first on board HMS Defiance and then on board HMS Magnanime frigate of 48 guns. On the former he resisted a mutiny, while on the latter he assisted in the capture of the 36-gun French frigate La D√©cade, on 24 August 1798, off Cape Finisterre. He was also present at the Battle of Tory Island, where the French squadron under Jean Bompart was defeated off the coast of Ireland. During the course of the engagement, Charles Dashwood captured the 74-gun Le Hoche, and later received the sword of the French commodore.James & Chamier, p.129 He was superseded by an officer of HMS Canada, bearing Sir John B. Warren's broad pendant, and was appointed in command of La Coquille, one of the frigates captured that day, which he sailed into Belfast and then to Plymouth. She was accidentally burnt on 14 December, and several of her crew, along with three women, perished.Urban, p.637 He continued serving on board Magnagnime and after contributing to the capture of some privateers, on 2 August 1799 he was promoted to the rank of commander, and appointed captain of the 18-gun ship HMS Sylph. The following year, Dashwood's command was employed on operations within gunshot distance of the French batteries in Brest harbour, and on one occasion, during a foggy night, he rescued the British frigate HMS Alcmene, after she had become grounded and began drifting among the rocks. On 31 July, while stationed off the north-coast of Spain, Dashwood beat off the 44-gun French frigate L'Art√©mise; after a vigorous action of an hour and 29 minutes. On 28 September, about 40 leagues to the north of Cape Pinas, he discovered a large ship, apparently of similar force to her former opponent. After exchanging broadsides and conducting several tacks, at 7:30 pm the Sylph succeeded in placing herself on the weather bow of the frigate, and the engagement commenced, which continued for two hours until the enemy escaped, having inflicted heavy damage on Sylphs sails and rigging.Allen, Vol II, p.58 After beating the enemy twice, Dashwood, on rejoining the fleet off Brest, was congratulated by Admiral William Cornwallis who recommended to the Board of Admiralty that he be promoted, albeit with no effect. Dashwood had repeatedly hailed the enemy to ascertain her name and nation, but received no answer. In consequence of not being able to tell the name of the enemy ship, his promotion was delayed, as it evidenced in the following letter from the Earl of St. Vincent, replying to Cornwallis' recommendation of Dashwood's application for a post commission: > I have read your official letter with all the attention such a recital > merits; but until the Board receive official information of the force, and > the nation to which the vessel belongs, which the Sylph was engaged with, > and adequate judgement cannot be formed of the merits of the > action.Marshall, p.454 Dashwood was finally promoted to Post-captain on 2 November 1801, and was given command of the 20-gun sloop HMS Bacchante on 28 November 1803. Aboard that ship he convoyed a fleet from Oporto and then proceeded to the West Indies, where he captured, on 3 April 1803, the Spanish schooner La Elizabeth, of 10 guns and 47 men. On 14 May 1805 he also took El Felix, a Spanish letter- of-marque of six guns and 42 men. He later wrote an account of the capture to Rear-Admiral James Dacres: > Bacchante, off the Havana, May 14, 1805. > Sir, I beg to acquaint you, that the Spanish schooner le Felix, a Letter of > Marque, pierced for ten guns, but only six mounted, with a complement of > forty-two men, commanded by Francisco Lopes, laden with coffee and bees wax, > from the Havana to Vera Cruz, was this day captured by His Majesty's Ship > under my Command, after a Chase of four hours. She sailed the preceding > evening, and was permitted to do so from her very great superiority of > sailing, and is the first Vessel that has quitted that anchorage since the > Embargo was laid on. > I have the honour to be, &c.; C. DASHWOOD, Captain.Clarke & McArthur, Vol > 14, p. 72  Napoleonic Wars  On 5 April 1805, as Bacchante was cruising off Havana, Dashwood received information that there were three French privateers lying in the harbour of Mariel, located to the westward and defended by a tower nearly 40 feet high, on the top of which were placed three long 24-pounders, and round its oval numerous loop-holes for musketry. Dashwood endeavoured to cut them out. Accordingly, in the evening, he dispatched on that service two boats, containing about 35 seamen and marines, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Oliver, with directions to attack and carry the fort prior to entering the harbour. When the boats pushed off, the tower fired at them. Seeing that no time was to be lost, the British marines rushed to the foot of the tower and scaled it. It was defended by a Spanish captain and 30 soldiers, who were quickly over powered after suffering casualties of two killed and three wounded. The privateers had already left the harbour, but Oliver, determined not to quit the harbour empty-handed, captured two schooners laden with sugar, which were brought away.James & Chamier, p.28, Vol IV. While commanding HMS Franchise, a frigate of 36 guns, Dashwood saw action in the West Indies, where he captured the Spanish schooner El Carmen and the Dutch armed vessel Brutus.Marshall, Vol II, p.457 In January 1806 Dashwood received information that several Spanish vessels had anchored in the Bay of Campeche and he determined to try to capture them. On the night of 6 January, having anchored about from the town of Campeche, Dashwood dispatched three of Franchise's boats, under the command of three lieutenants. Because of the distance they had to row, the British did not reach the Spanish vessels until 4:00 am on the 7th, by which time the moon had risen, their approach had been observed and the Spaniards alerted. As the boats pulled in, the British parties became exposed to the fire of two Spanish brigs of war, a schooner and seven gun- boats. After about 10 minutes of hand-to-hand fighting, Dashwood's boarding parties had captured the Spanish national brig Raposa, which mounted 12 guns. The prize was pursued by the other Spanish vessels, which continued to fire on them until they withdrew.Allen, p.157 British warships fire upon Copenhagen. On 1 August 1807, he parted in company with Commodore Richard Keats' squadron and sailed to the passage of the Great Belt, in order to intercept any ships carrying Danish troops crossing from Holstein to Zealand.James & Chamier, Vol IV, p.286 Accompanied by HMS Magicienne, Dashwood also escorted a convoy of 109 ships from Jamaica, and accompanied James Gambier on his expedition against Copenhagen in August and September 1807. After this expedition, in 1808 he returned to the West Indies with a convoy, and served successively under the orders of John Duckworth and Vice-Admiral James Dacres. On 17 November 1808 Dashwood rendered an essential service to the Spanish patriots. A squadron under his orders, consisting of the former HM Ships Franchise, Daedalus, Aurora, Reindeer and Pert, blockaded the city of Santo Domingo by taking possession of the town of Saman√°, where the French were erecting batteries for their permanent establishment. In the harbour he found two French schooner privateers, √âchange and Guerrier, each of five guns and upwards of 100 men,The Annual Biography and Obituary, p.448 and three trading vessels, all of which were taken.Brenton, p.253 An English ship and a Spanish one were also recaptured while in the act of entering the port. After this brief action, he handed the port over a Spanish force under Don Diego de Lira, and a couple of weeks later he sailed to Port Royal, in Jamaica, with his captures.Marley, p.373 Dashwood also captured Le Hazard, a French privateer of four guns and 40 men off Scilly. In January 1809, he captured L'Iphig√©nie, a French letter-of-marque pierced for 18 guns. On 22 September 1809 Captain Dashwood presided a court martial to try Joseph Fountain, Master of HMS Polyphemus.Byrn, p. 162 Dashwood's next command was the 36-gun frigate HMS Belvidera, which he obtained in January 1810, and held that command until March.Windfield, p. 168 He was then appointed to HMS Pyramus, a 36-gun frigate fitting for the Baltic station. Cruising on those latitudes, Dashwood captured a Danish privateer, giving notice of his feat: > Sir, I beg to acquaint you, that the Danish three-masted schooner privateer > Norsk Mod, of six guns, four swivels, 28 men, and of 100 tons burthen, > commanded by Mathias Bergt, was captured at two o'clock this morning by the > Pyramus. ‚Äì This privateer had left Arundel only six hours, and sailed for > the express purpose of annoying the very large convoy that sailed yesterday > from Gottenburgh for England. I have the honour to be, &c.; C. DASHWOOD, > Captain.The European Magazine, p.306  Later service  During the winter of 1811, Dashwood commanded a squadron of 10 sloops and smaller vessels, in order to collect and bring home the remnant of Rear-Admiral Robert Reynold's convoy that had been prevented from passing through the Skagerrak by bad weather. On this occasion, he availed himself of a strong S.S.W. wind, and boldly pushed through the Malm√∂ Channel, instead of the Great Belt as ordered, saving the remaining of ships from destruction.Ross, p.267 The Battle of New Orleans. In the Baltic, amidst the context of the Anglo-Swedish War, Dashwood received notice that the Swedes were fitting out eight sail of the line and five frigates at Karlskrona.Voelcker p.189 The British consul in Sweden, a man named Smith, passed on to Dashwood a request from the Swedish government that those ships not be molested. Dashwood gave orders to his crew to respect the Swedish flag, and also informed Swedish Admiral Puke that there should not be misunderstanding between the two nations, as war between the United Kingdom and Sweden existed only on paper. Early in the spring, he was sent with his squadron to provide protection to the island of Anholt, which was threatened by the Danes. No action followed, though, as the Danish attempt to occupy the island was abandoned on the appearance of Dashwood's fleet.Ross, p.273 Afterwards Dashwood took eight American merchantmen,Clarke & McArthur, Vol 28 p.249 and on 15 June 1812, he captured the Hope, a merchant ship off the north of Gothland.Williams, p.186. On 14 August 1812 he was appointed captain of HMS Cressy of 74 guns, and given a piece of plate by the officers of HMS Pyramus.Marshall, p.458 After serving in the North Sea under Admiral Sir William Young, Dashwood escorted a convoy to the West Indies, whence he returned with another of equal importance. At the review of the fleet at Spithead, in the summer of 1814, he steered the Royal barge. Afterwards he took part, commanding HMS Norge of 74 guns, in the Battle of New Orleans, where he assisted Admiral Pulteney Malcolm in the debarkation of the army, being reported by Sir Alexander Cochrane. He was also present at the Battle of Lake Borgne, where a few gunboats of the Norge, in company with other small vessels, captured five American gunboats. In 1815, when at anchor in Port Royal, his ship was struck by lightning, which broke the main-topgallant-mast in three pieces, shivered the maintop-mast and brought the mizentop-mast and topgallant-mast down on to deck.Pollock, p. 501 In 1821 he was given command of HMS Windsor Castle of 74 guns, and HMS Impregnable, of 104 guns, as Cochrane's flag-captain. He recommissioned Windsor Castle on 4 January 1822, as part of the guard-ships in Hamoaze. In 1825 he was put onto half-pay, and was made a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830. He assumed the rank of vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. Charles died while at service, on 21 September 1847. Consequently, on 22 September 1847, the Admiralty promoted him posthumously to the rank of admiral.  Family  In 1799, Dashwood married Elizabeth de Courcy, the daughter of Lord Kingsale, John de Courcy. They had three children. His two eldest sons, Charles Robert and John De Courcy, were commissioned into the Royal Navy. His youngest son, Francis, became a captain in the Bengal Horse Artillery.The Annual Register, p. 327.

He was knighted on 20 April 1825, and made a Grand Cross Tower and Sword on 30 March 1825, conferred to him when the King of Portugal went on board HMS Windsor Castle, while at anchor on the Tagus, in May 1824. Dashwood was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath of Maxwelton on 4 July 1840.Townsend, p.82 *b. The real name and force of this ship, still remains unclear. *c.

Until the employment of Laura Gundersen in 1849, however, the theatre employed almost exclusively actors from Denmark and Germany, in large because Norway did not yet have an established theatre school and trained actors. Str√∂mberg had the ambition to create Norwegian actors, but upon the foundation of the first theatre in Norway there was not trained Norwegian actors, which made it necessary to employ Danish actors. Among the first mentioned were Christiane Hansen and Jens Lang B√∏cher, both hired in 1827 and described as greatly talented students. During the 1830s, she was described as the leading lady of the stage and popular among both the public and the critics and compared to the famous Mademoiselle Mars in Paris. She was described as considerable talent as well as a sympathetic personality, and particularly praised for her good taste in regard to her costume. The theatre critic signature \\"R.\\" remarked that as he could not find enough praise for her and was afraid to boor his readers by trying, he customarily gave her the critic \\"Madame B√∏cher acted as usual\\"- that is to say \\"excellent in all aspects\\".Blanc, Tharald H√∏yerup: Christiania theaters historie 1827-1877, J.W. Cappelen Christiania After her performance as Susanna in the Marriage of Figaro, a viewer commented in Christianias Aftenblad that: :\\"he had not seen any one above her, hardly any one alongside her. Correct declamation, loveable naivety, some afected coqettry to hid the finest virtue, a tasteful costume [...] united in the creation of a skillful actress in full grandeur.\\"Blanc, Tharald H√∏yerup: Christiania theaters historie 1827-1877, J.W. Cappelen Christiania However, she was not given all praise - while considered terrific in comedy, she was not regarded to be of much use in tragedy or as a singer (for that Augusta Schrumpf (1813‚Äì1900) was her parallel in the theatre). Among her parts where Luise Miller in Kabale og Kj√¶rlighed Maria in Correggio and Valborg in Axel og Valbor. She retired from the stage in 1837 and left Norway for Denmark with her spouse in July of that year. ReferencesOther sources * Blanc, Tharald H√∏yerup: Christiania theaters historie 1827-1877, J.W.

She exhibited 54 works at the Royal Scottish Academy between 1886 and 1919. Early life and education Mrs. Blair with her Dogs The grave of the Cameron family, Dean Cemetery Mary Margaret Cameron was born on 9 March 1865 in Portobello in Edinburgh, the third of six children of Mary Brown Small and Duncan Cameron. Her father was associated with the Edinburgh printing and stationery firm of Macniven and Cameron and the inventor of the \\"Waverley\\" pen-nib. Her father also owned The Oban Times newspaper. Her mother was a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean of Perthshire. Cameron was the younger sister of Flora Macaulay ‚Äì widow of the Rev Robert Blair ‚Äì who was editor of The Oban Times newspaper until her death in 1958, aged 99. Cameron first began her art education at the age of 16 through the Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh, winning prizes from the age of 17. She took classes at the Edinburgh Veterinary College to perfect her understanding of animal anatomy, and developed a particular skill for depicting horses. This reflected her early interest in unusual subject matter, and was helped by her ability to use her own horse as a model.  Spain  In 1900, Cameron travelled to Madrid in Spain to study the work of 17th-century Spanish painter, Diego Vel√°zquez. She fell in love with the country, its people and culture. She painted many Spanish scenes, violent and masculine topics such as battlefields, horse racing and particularly bullfights, and lived for a time in Madrid and Seville. She generated controversy in her native Scotland over her realistic portrayal of the sometimes brutal bullfighting scenes.  Career  Cameron was a member of the Edinburgh Ladies' Art Club and the first exhibition of the Society of Scottish Artists, she was later involved with the Royal Scottish Academy, (RSA) but in 1901, when women could exhibit at RSA but not become members, her application was nominated with Pheobe Anna Traquair and Christina Paterson Ross, but no women were elected until 1938, Josephine Haswell Miller. Cameron had three other failed attempts. She exhibited 56 works at the RSA between 1886 and 1919. Her painting, Portrait de Mme. Blair et ses borzois received a \\"Mention Honorable\\" at the Paris Salon in 1904. The winning portrait depicted her sister Flora with her two Russian Borzoi dogs at either side. The painting, along with one of Cameron's Spanish paintings, was published in the book Women Painters of the World (1905). Cameron held four solo exhibitions between 1908 and 1913 in Edinburgh, London and Paris, with a critic praising her \\"power, ease and fearlessness\\". In addition to being a talented artist, Cameron was also a capable linguist, and spoke French and Spanish fluently. She also had a good knowledge of German and Italian, and knew enough Russian to read and translate it. On 30 June 1905 Cameron married Alexis Millar, a horse dealer and jobmaster from Edinburgh, at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London. Mary Cameron died at Turnhouse, a hamlet to the west of the Edinburgh, on 15 February 1921, and is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave lies in the obscured southern terrace, towards the east end. Legacy Cameron has a small number of paintings in the British national collections. A portrait of Cameron at work in her studio, by John Brown Abercromby, is held by the National Gallery of Scotland. She has been described as a 'trailblazer\\" for women artists and gender equality.

Life Born in Mugello to the powerful family of the counts of Pila, Ruggieri was the son of Ubaldino and the nephew of cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini. He began his clerical career in the archepiscopal curia of the archdiocese of Bologna, then in 1271 the Ghibelline inhabitants of Ravenna made him archbishop of Ravenna-Cervia, in rivalry to another prelate appointed by the Guelphs. The conflicts between them convinced the pope to exclude them both from the office. In 1278 he became archbishop of Pisa, a city then governed by the Guelphs Ugolino della Gherardesca and Nino Visconti. Ruggieri initially settled the conflict between the two tried to promote Ghibellines, but soon (posing as Nino's friend) played them off against each other in an attempt to finish off them both. He led the revolt which finally deposed count Ugolino and the Gualandi, Sismodni and Lanfranchi families. According to contemporary chroniclers, followed by Dante, he captured Ugolino by deception - it is definite that he imprisoned him, his two sons and his two grandsons in the Torre della Muda, where they died. Probably for this reason, or for betraying the Visconti, Dante places Ruggieri in hell. Even Pope Nicholas IV rebuked Ruggieri for his behaviour and sent him a condemnation of his treatment of Ugolino and the Guelphs, but the pope's death prevented him acting on these and saved Ruggieri from punishment. After Ugolino's death in 1289, Ruggieri had himself nominated as podest√† of Pisa, but was unable to sustain the conflict with the Visconti and had to forfeit the office. He continued to live in his archdiocese, retaining the title until his death in 1295 in Viterbo, where he had recently moved. His tomb in the cloister of the monastery attached to the church of Santa Maria in Gradi Viterbo (now the headquarters of the Tuscia University) is now lost. Ruggieri in Dante Gustave Dor√©, Ugolino biting archbishop Ruggieri Ruggieri appears in canto XXXIII of Dante's Inferno, in the second band of the ninth circle, in Antenora, where traitors are punished. In punishment for sentencing four innocents to die alongside the guilty, Dore' has Ugolino gnawing Rugieri's skull for all eternity - he says nothing in the poem.

He was also artistic director of the National Theatre in Belgrade (1877 and 1880-1893), a member of the Serbian Learned Society and Serbian Royal Academy. Biography Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin was born in ≈†abac, then part of the Principality of Serbia, on the 12 of July 1841 to Sava and Jelisaveta Popoviƒá. His father was a respected teacher, writer, and judge in the town of Sabac, and a loyal friend of the ruling Obrenoviƒá dynasty. In 1842, however, he lost his post suddenly when Mihailo Obrenoviƒá III, Prince of Serbia was deposed. Sava first went to Zemun and then to Irig, where his wife Jelisaveta and their four children (Paul, George, Milorad, and Katica) soon joined him. (Their fifth child, Danica, was not born yet). Sava managed to secure a job as a clerk in Irig. There his youngest son Milorad grew up and completed his elementary education. For his secondary education, Milorad attended the Gymnasium Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj in Novi Sad and the Gymnasium of Karlovci before going to Belgrade's Grandes √©coles. In Novi Sad Milorad Popoviƒá got the nickname \\"≈†apƒçanin\\", in other words, the man from ≈†abac, which he would eventually adopt as his pen name, nom de plume. It was the exposure to Novi Sad and Sremski Karlovci that he became acquainted with the ideas of Serbian patriotism and Slav reciprocity. ≈†apƒçanin was inspired by a burning enthusiasm for the greatness and welfare of Serbia (then divided by two empires) and worked in the same reformatory direction as all other contemporary intellectuals of his. He was also politically engaged, sympathizing with the ideas of the United Serbian Youth, among whom were Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, Stojan Novakoviƒá, Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá, ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá, Laza Kostiƒá, Ljubomir Nenadoviƒá, Laza Lazareviƒá (his future brother-in-law), Milan Miliƒáeviƒá, Milovan Gli≈°iƒá, and others. In the meantime, ≈†apƒçanin's family fortune had changed somewhat by then. In 1858 Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá I, Prince of Serbia was restored as prince for the last two years of his life. Milo≈°'s son, Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá III, once again took over the throne, now vacated by the death of his father in 1860, and Sava Popoviƒá and his family were back in ≈†abac. ≈†apƒçanin's father (Sava) was named to the post of district judge by Prince Mihailo himself. Not long after, Sava died almost the same year that ≈†apƒçanin graduated from the School of Divinity of Belgrade's Grandes √©coles. Upon graduation, he became a secretary of the Ecclesiastical Court in ≈†abac. A poem was written by Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin which appeared in Stojan Novakoviƒá's literary magazine Vila came to the attention of the Serbian prince. ≈†apƒçanin was called to Belgrade in 1866 by Mihailo Obrenovic III, Prince of Serbia, to fill a clerical post in the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, and became a prominent member of the brilliant circle which included Ljubomir Nenadoviƒá, writer and director of the Ministry of Culture, playwright Milovan Gli≈°iƒá, short story writer and physician Laza Lazareviƒá, writer Janko Veselinoviƒá. In Belgrade, ≈†apƒçanin enjoyed the continued favor of the Obrenoviƒá court. There, in 1866, he married Milka Lazareviƒá, Dr. Laza Lazareviƒá's sister, with whom he had four children, however, two died in early childhood. He remained there for the rest of his life, except for the absence of one year when he went abroad to study the educational systems of other European countries. He became the intimate of Laza Lazareviƒá, his brother-in-law, historian Stojan Novakoviƒá, Ljubomir Nenadoviƒá, and Milovan Gli≈°iƒá who convinced him to become the secretary of the newly founded National Theatre in Belgrade in 1868; from then on the artistic world became his chief occupation, and he produced many poems and articles as editor-in-chief of Domaƒçica, with pronounced political tendencies, his object being to point out the evils of foreign interference and domination in Serbia and to reawaken national feeling. The last years of the 1870s were embittered by the war with Turkey (1876-1878), on which Serbia had felt compelled to embark in accordance with the terms of the treaty of alliance with Russia. At the time ≈†apƒçanin worked for the press department at the Army's General Headquarters. His life was mainly that of a thinker and a writer. He was a strenuous advocate of reform, especially in the teaching of sciences and the arts; and supported the claims of modern languages to a place in the curriculum. ≈†apƒçanin labored to raise the standard of instruction in grade school and high schools in Serbia. With Milan Miliƒáeviƒá and Stevan Popoviƒá (the father of Du≈°an Popoviƒá (1877-1958)) he became involved in reforming the educational system in Serbia. He left Belgrade in 1870 and went abroad to study other countries' teaching practices and improve on them as well. He spent a year in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In Germany, he visited Berlin, Leipzig, Gotha, and Weimar. In Weimar, he befriended Joca Simiƒá, a famous Serbian actor living and working there. Saviƒá was a protegee of Heinrich Laube and Adolf von Sonnenthal. (The paths of the two would meet again when ≈†apƒçanin became the artistic director of the National Theatre for the second time.) At the time the Serbian legislature, effecting in 1870 the passage of a bill, framed and introduced by distinguished Serbian educators, which provided for \\"the better supervision of the common schools\\" in Serbia. Of this board he was secretary, and during this worked indefatigably to reorganize and reform the common school system of the principality (which was working towards its independence), thus earning a national reputation as an educational reformer. He was a commissioner (nadzornik) of public schools in Serbia, and his administration was marked by a decided step in educational progress. He died in Belgrade on the 14th of February 1895. Theatre He believed that literature and the arts and music should have a social and national purpose and that it should be written and performed for the people with an original script, artistic backdrop, choreography, music, and dance. He was the artistic director of the National Theatre in Belgrade in 1877 and in 1880-1893. As a poet, short story writer, educational reformer, he exerted a major influence on his era. In Belgrade, ≈†apƒçanin made acquaintance with Milovan Gli≈°iƒá, who is reported to have encouraged his dramatic ambitions and to have given him the benefit of his own experience as a playwright. While at the National Theatre in Belgrade in 1877 he made a translation in blank verse of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven\\" but forestalled by other activities, it was published only five years later (1882). Some 29 new Serbian plays and 152 foreign, translated works were produced and performed during Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin's tenure, according to his own report on the 10-year work of the National Theatre in Belgrade, from 1880 to 1890. He was a mentor to many young Serbian playwrights, namely Branislav Nu≈°iƒá (1864-1938), Dragutin Iliƒá (1858-1926), Milo≈° Cvetiƒá (1845-1905), and others. Individuals like Laza Kostiƒá, Janko Veselinoviƒá together with Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒáanin constituted the intellectual and literary core of the National Theatre in Belgrade. That management was entrusted collectively with the task of upgrading theatrical programs along with the Western European model. Milorad P. ≈†apƒáanin, who led the National Theatre for almost 15 years, tried to encourage Serbian writers to produce new plays with both singing and dance (musicals). Early on, however, ≈†apƒáanin produced national folk songs, written for the romantic and heroic plays by established Serbian authors such as Markova sablja (Marko's Sabre) by Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá; Seoba Srbalja (The Migration of The Serbs) by ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá; Du≈°an silni (Dushan the Mighty) by Milorad ≈†apƒáanin; and others. Besides Du≈°an silni, he wrote and produced Milo≈° u Latinima, in one-act; Bogomili, a drama in four acts; Trnova kruna, a drama in five acts; and Gospoƒëica kao seljanka (A Madam Like a Peasant Woman), a comedy in four acts, based on Pushkin's work. Politics His political activism for a Serbian national revival dealt through his participation in many publications, most notably Vila, Danica, Javor, Otad≈æbina, Strazilo, Domaƒçica, and other publications. He came into politics with the Progressive Party, led by Milutin Gara≈°anin, son of Ilija Gara≈°anin, and Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá. The Progressive Party sprang from a group of young conservatives, imbued with Western liberalism. Their better known regional leaders were Milan Piroƒáanac, Milan Miliƒáeviƒá, ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá, historian and magazine publisher Stojan Novakoviƒá, poet Milan Kujund≈æiƒá Aberdar, and poet Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin. He retired from active politics but resumed his involvement after the renewal of the constitutional order. Short stories and novels The most important of which are: Hasanaga, Deda, Monah Denaƒëija, Dvadeset sest, Poremeƒáen plan, Surgun, chronicles of the times he lived; they give a general account of scenes and events, most of which he had witnessed and experienced. Sanjalo, a novel, with the main character being Grgur the Serbian poet, and through him, the writer speaks just as eloquently as though he's reciting poetry. S Drine na Ni≈°avu is a travel book that reads more like a novel since the writer focuses on what the travelers have to say. Poems He is best known for epic poems he wrote, particularly Kraljevo Zvono, Zadu≈æbina cara Lazara, Nevjesti ljuti, Monaha, etc., interesting as a picture of his personal experiences and of contemporary morality. His success as a poet was coeval with his earliest publication of a poem called Pesma (The Poem). On leaving academia with but slender means of support, he devoted himself to letters, and in 1863 published his first volume of verse Pesma in Belgrade, which was followed by Zubori i Vihori in 1866. ≈†apƒçanin's life was steadily devoted to literary production. He printed other volumes of verse, among which the epic poem Nevestu Ljutice Bogdana (1886) received unstinted praise from his peers. Later, several of his historical plays in verse were produced at the National Theatre in Belgrade and on other stages; and from 1879 onwards a stream of prose followed from his pen, including studies of village, town and city life, sketches of well-known persons, and a series of tales, most of which were republished in his collected works. He also wrote travel books--S Drine na Ni≈°avu‚Äîbeing the most popular. Throughout a life spent mainly in Belgrade, ≈†apƒçanin's genial character and cultivated mind won him the friendship of the chief men of letters of his time. He was also intimate with playwright Gli≈°iƒá, Joca Saviƒá, and other famous actors. In 1868 he was made a member of the Serbian Learned Society and became an honorary member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1892. The best of his lyrical work, excelled for finish and intense sincerity, is his Kraljevo zvono, and had he chosen to dedicate himself to lyric poetry only, he might possibly have ranked with the best of Serbia's modern poets; as it is, he is a very considerable poet who affects the dramatic form. In his later writings ≈†apƒáanin deals with modern society, its vices, ideals, and perils; yet in many essentials, he is a manifest disciple of German writers of his era. His reputation with his contemporaries was high, both personally and as a writer, though he had no ambition to be known as the latter. As an author, his writings are trenchant and clear, and interesting, especially if one reads the social and political allusions between the lines. After 1890 he concentrated on publishing collection of his articles on aesthetics, politics, lectures, and poetry, and also worked to complete his bibliography. ≈†apƒçanin was a leading personality in the Serbian national movement for more than thirty years. He wrote more than 20 books, among which were Pesme (1863), Pripovetke in three tomes (1877/1879), Ljudi starog kova, and Zadu≈æbina (1893). Among his works there is a drama about Petar Dojƒçin. Literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá said ≈†apƒçanin's opus will at least ensure for him an honorable place in the history of modern Serbian literature.

The term was created by economic historian Karl Polanyi as part of his substantivist approach. Polanyi argued that in non-market societies there are no pure economic institutions to which formal economic models can be applied. In these cases economic activities such as \\"provisioning\\" are \\"embedded\\" in non- economic kinship, religious and political institutions. In market societies, in contrast, economic activities have been rationalized, and economic action is \\"disembedded\\" from society and able to follow its own distinctive logic, captured in economic modeling. Polanyi's ideas were widely adopted and discussed in anthropology in what has been called the formalist‚Äìsubstantivist debate. Subsequently, the term \\"embeddedness\\" was further developed by economic sociologist Mark Granovetter, who argued that even in market societies, economic activity is not as disembedded from society as economic models would suggest. Karl Polanyi According to Polanyi, in non- capitalist, pre-industrial economies livelihoods are not based on market exchange but on redistribution and reciprocity. Reciprocity is defined as the mutual exchange of goods or services as part of long-term relationships. Redistribution implies the existence of a strong political centre such as kinship-based leadership, which receives and then redistributes subsistence goods according to culturally specific principles. Economic decision-making in such places is not so much based on individual choice, but rather on social relationships, cultural values, moral concerns, politics, religion or the fear instilled by authoritarian leadership. Production in most peasant and tribal societies is for the producers, also called 'production for use' or subsistence production, as opposed to 'production for exchange' which has profit maximisation as its chief aim. This difference in types of economy is explained by the 'embeddedness' of economic (i.e. provisioning) activities in other social institutions such as kinship in non-market economies. Rather than being a separate and distinct sphere, the economy is embedded in both economic and non-economic institutions. Exchange takes place within and is regulated by society rather than being located in a social vacuum. For example, religion and government can be just as important to economics as economic institutions themselves. Socio-cultural obligations, norms and values play a significant role in people's livelihood strategies. Consequently, any analysis of economics as an analytically distinct entity isolated from its socio-cultural and political context is flawed from the outset. A substantivist analysis of economics will therefore focus on the study of the various social institutions on which people's livelihoods are based. The market is only one amongst many institutions that determine the nature of economic transactions. Polanyi's central argument is that institutions are the primary organisers of economic processes. The substantive economy is an \\"instituted process of interaction between man and his environment, which results in a continuous supply of want satisfying material means.\\" Mark Granovetter Economic Sociologist Mark Granovetter provided a new research paradigm (neo-substantivism) for these researchers. Granovetter argued that the neoclassical view of economic action which separated economics from society and culture promoted an 'undersocialized account' that atomises human behavior. Similarly, he argued, substantivists had an \\"over-socialized\\" view of economic actors, refusing to see the ways that rational choice could influence the ways they acted in traditional, \\"embedded\\" social roles. Granovetter applied the concept of embeddedness to market societies, demonstrating that even there, \\"rational\\" economic exchanges are influenced by pre-existing social ties. In his study of ethnic Chinese business networks in Indonesia, Granovetter found individuals' economic agency embedded in networks of strong personal relations. In processes of clientelization the cultivation of personal relationships between traders and customers assumes an equal or higher importance than the economic transactions involved. Economic exchanges are not carried out between strangers but rather by individuals involved in long-term continuing relationships.

It was published by Little, Brown and Company in 2012.

Summary The broad humor that runs throughout this heavily illustrated story from Patterson and Grabenstein masks personal pain, demonstrating resiliency in the face of tragedy. Wheelchair-bound middle-schooler Jamie has recently moved in with his aunt‚Äôs cheerless family, including‚Äîa bit too conveniently‚Äîschool bully Stevie, Jamie‚Äôs new ‚Äúadoptive brother.‚Äù Despite Jamie‚Äôs desire to be treated like an ordinary kid (one of the more important themes the authors emphasize) and a dark, lingering unknown (only late in the novel does Jamie reveal the reason for his paralysis and his parents‚Äô absence), humor abounds. Much of it derives from Jamie‚Äôs comedic aspirations (he calls himself a ‚Äúsit-down comic‚Äù), which are fueled by his friends‚Äô reactions to his one-liners and the encouragement of his warmhearted uncle. Park‚Äôs wisecracking cartoons (not all seen by PW) play an integral role in the storytelling, laying bare Jamie‚Äôs fears, triumphs, and sense of humor. Characters *Jamie Grimm is the disabled protagonist of the story. He enters the Planet's Funniest Kid Comic Contest and wins the Long Island competition, then moves on to the state competition and wins. Next, he will go to the Regionals in Boston. He was involved in a serious car accident two years prior that killed his parents and his younger sister, Jenny, and left him paralyzed from the legs down, and puts him in a wheelchair. He is later relocated from his home in Cornwall in Upstate New York to his aunt and uncle's family (who he nicknamed \\"the Smileys\\" because they never smile, even when Jamie makes a joke) in Long Beach. * Suzie Orolvsky (also known as \\"Cool Girl\\") is a girl that Jamie carries her books for. They become good friends and she kisses Jamie at night in the light of the full moon. It is stated that Jamie and Gaynor both have feelings for her. She eventually had to move away to Chicago. * Stevie Kosgrov is Jamie's adoptive brother and bully. He often makes jokes at his expense saying Jamie is successful because he is disabled. * Uncle Frankie is Jamie's other uncle. He owns Frankie's Good Eats by the Sea Diner and is shown to be very talented with yo-yo tricks. * Joey Gaynor is one of Jamie's best friends. He has long hair, a nose ring, and several tattoos. He is said to be obsessed with girls. * Jimmy Pierce is one of Jamie's best friends. He is said to be nerdy, has glasses, and wears this black hat with a flat top and broad rim. He is a total brainiac and knows everything. * Gilda Gold is Jamie's girlfriend and admirer. She is shown to be a Boston Red Sox fan. * Shecky is a kid from Schenectady who competes in the New York finals. He tells distasteful and usually insulting jokes, and is overconfident and arrogant. His catchphrase after telling a joke is \\"Ba-Boom. Nailed it!\\". * Judy Nazemetz is a girl from Manhattan who competes in the New York finals. She is Jamie's friend and apparently has a contract with Disney to become the next Hannah Montana.

He served as Clerk of the Privy Council, Member of Parliament for Downton and Southampton, and English member of the Council of State of the Netherlands, and on many diplomatic missions for the English government.Wikisource:Wilkes, Thomas (DNB00) Personal life Little is known of Wilkes' early years. He may have been a native of Sussex. Apparently he spent eight years in Continental Europe on the Grand Tour after 1564, before he became a probationer-fellow at All Souls College, Oxford in 1572, where he graduated B.A. in February 1573 (N.S.). Wilkes married Margaret Smith, daughter of Ambrose Smith (a London Mercer) and Joan Coe, about 1578, with whom he had a daughter. After her death in 1596 he remarried with Frances Savage, daughter of Sir John Savage. Career Shortly after graduation, and still a probationer of All Souls, he joined the embassy of dr. Valentine Dale to France as Dale's secretary. (This caused some difficulty with the College that had to be resolved by Sir Francis Walsingham). In 1574 Queen Elizabeth instructed him to secretly contact the Prince de Cond√© and the Duke d'Alen√ßon, who had been arrested by the French Queen-mother, Catherine de Medici, to reassure them of her support. Catherine found out and tried to apprehend Wilkes. When he managed to escape to England Queen Elizabeth ordered him to resolve the diplomatic incident or never come back. He returned to France and managed to convince Catherine of his innocence which allowed him to remain in France as an English diplomat. In February 1575 he was tasked with a mission to the Elector Palatine to convince him to send an army into France to aid the Huguenots under the Prince de Cond√©. Wilkes followed this army on its campaign in France until the Peace of Monsieur in 1576. He returned to England highly recommended by both Cond√© and Alen√ßon. He became a Clerk of the Privy Council in July 1576, which office he would hold intermittently till his death. Soon afterward he was awarded the office of Queen's printer, which he quickly sold to Christopher Barker to augment his income of 40 pounds a year. Later he would receive similar privileges as a reward, which he often quickly sold on. Examples are the salt monopoly for the English east coast he received in 1585 and the lease of Downton rectory, that he eventually sold on to the Raleigh family. In 1577 Wilkes was sent to Spain and The Netherlands in connection with an attempt to intervene in the Dutch Revolt. He was to assure king Philip II of Spain of Elizabeth's good intentions and to convince him that the new governor-general in the Habsburg Netherlands, Don Juan would best be recalled. Though he was received cordially at the Spanish court, his advice was not taken. On the return voyage he visited both Don Juan and the Prince of Orange in the Netherlands to receive their respective views and report back to Elizabeth. In 1579 an arrangement was made for a six-monthly rotation of the clerks of the Privy Council, Wilkes' turns being May‚ÄìAugust and November‚ÄìDecember, but he was available for special commissions during the remainder of the year. In his capacity of clerk of the Privy Council Wilkes undertook many tasks, big and small. In 1581 for instance, he engaged in the interrogation under torture of the Jesuit priest Edmund Campion in this context, and in 1583 he investigated the conspiracy of Arden, Somerville and Hall. In the mid-1580s Wilkes embarked on a career as a Member of Parliament. In 1584 he was returned by Downton and in 1586 Southampton offered him a seat, though he had himself reelected by Downton that year (possibly because he was about to be sent abroad again). Southampton elected him in 1589 and 1593, however. Apparently he did not attend the first three Parliaments he was elected to (or no activity is known), but in 1593 he was put on several committees, among which the subsidy committee. In 1586 Wilkes was sent to the Dutch Republic to accompany the Earl of Leicester and keep an eye on him. Wilkes maintained a secret correspondence with the Queen's Secretary of State and spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham, in which Leicester was known as Themistocles, that grew increasingly critical of the policies of the Earl. In 1587 Wilkes was appointed to the Dutch Council of StateOn the basis of the Treaty of Nonsuch the English government could appoint two members of the Council. as the successor to Henry Killigrew. In his capacity of member of the Council he addressed the States of Holland with a \\"Remonstrance\\" in which he defended the policy of the Earl to oppose the Regenten and promote the democratic (and extreme Calvinist) factions with an appeal to popular sovereignty \\"by default of a legal Prince.\\" This prompted the States to a response, written by Fran√ßois Vranck, that would become an important ideological statement of the principles of the (largely unwritten) \\"constitution\\" of the Dutch Republic. Though Wilkes' approach was rejected, his intervention thus occasioned an important development in the founding of the Dutch Republic. Meanwhile, relations with Leicester (who had become aware of the criticism behind his back from Wilkes and his colleague Lord Buckhurst) grew increasingly tense and in June, 1587, Wilkes returned to England without permission from the Queen, who had him imprisoned for a while in the Fleet Prison. Though he was soon released his disgrace lasted for two years. Only in August 1589 was Wilkes able to take up his work as clerk of the Privy Council again (apparently he was even briefly considered as Secretary of State after the death of Walsingham in 1590. In the last years of his life he was often sent on important diplomatic missions. So was he employed in a mission to France in March‚ÄìJuly 1592 during which the new king Henri IV (formerly the Prince de Cond√©) knighted him for his services (his was therefore a foreign knighthood). At the end of this mission he managed to conclude an alliance with France despite the conversion of the king to Catholicism. In September, 1594 he was entrusted with a mission to Brussels to obtain from the government of the Spanish Netherlands the extradition of a number of people implicated in the conspiracy of the Queen's physician, dr. L√≥pez, but this mission was aborted for diplomatic reasons. Death In February 1598 Wilkes was sent on another diplomatic mission to France with Sir Robert Cecil. Before he left for France he made his will, which shows that despite (or maybe because of) his sale of the offices he had been awarded, he had not been able to amass a great fortune. He left only small bequests to his infant daughter and servant, the residue of the estate going to his new wife. Wilkes was already ill (possibly of an accident) when Cecil and he landed at Dieppe. Wilkes died from his illness a few weeks later, on 2 March 1598 (N.S.) in Rouen. Besides the Remonstrance referred to above, Wilkes left A Briefe and Summary Tractate shewing what apperteineth to the Place, Dignity, and Office of a councellour of estate in a Monarchy or other Commonwealth, dedicated to Sir Robert Cecil, as a work of political philosophy.

Young is an Intel executive. He was a manager of the design for an oscillator used in Intel microprocessors (dubious claim, please cite proper reference since this was a common achievement of university and industry ) Young has written 50 research papers, and has 71 patents in switched capacitor circuits, DRAM, SRAM, BiCMOS, x86 clocking, Photonics and spintronics.  Biography  Born in Melbourne, Australia, Young received his bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Melbourne, Australia. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1978, where he did research on MOSFET switched- capacitor filters.  Technical career = Early career, analog MOS integrated circuits and switched capacitor filters = Young obtained his PhD from University of California, Berkeley in 1978, working with David A. Hodges, developing the first switched MOS capacitor circuits which later developed into analogue MOS switched capacitor filters. = Intel BiCMOS for Logic and SRAM = Young started at Intel in 1983 with the development of circuits for the world's first 1 Mb DRAM in 1 Œºm CMOS in 1985, and first 64 K SRAM in 1 Œºm CMOS. This was also the first military qualified SRAM under the VHIC program. At 600 nanometre node, Intel adopted BiCMOS for logic requiring the development of a BiCMOS SRAM for cache and a new family of standard logic circuits.The BiCMOS logic family employed the npn devices in the pull-up path of the BiCMOS gate, to form a low power CMOS logic family with high capacitive drive capability. Intel's BiCMOS technology was enabled by an innovative triple diffused npn transistor. This led to a highly manufacturable low cost process due to minimum number of additional process steps. In contrast, other companies employed BiCMOS to implement emitter-coupled logic for microprocessors, which consumed much more power. The BiCMOS circuits were developed for the Pentium processor family and its follow-on generations, Pentium Pro, Pentium II processor family. = Pentium era and clock scaling = Young developed the original Phase Locked Loop (PLL) based clocking circuit in a microprocessor while working on the 50 MHz Intel 80486 processor design. He subsequently developed the core PLL clocking circuit building blocks used in each generation of Intel microprocessors through the 0.13 Œºm 3.2 GHz Pentium 4. The successful introduction of GHz clocking contributed to massive improvements in computing power. The 486DX2 architecture showing on board PLL and clock 390x390px The integration of an on-chip PLL enabled the clock rates to exceed the off chip interconnect I/O rate in DX2. This led to the integration of an on-chip cache, paving the path for the first microprocessor with 1 million transistors. The clock rate scaling ushered by Intel and AMD ended as the thermal power dissipation of processors reached 100 W/cm^2. By the end of the race for clock speed, the clock rates had increased by a factor of more than 50. Intel subsequently shifted to multi-core era with modified Intel Core architecture and concurrent improvements in cache sizes to take advantage of the continued success of Moore's law. = Interconnects and photonics = In 2001, as single end signalled aluminium interconnects reached the technology scaling limits, Young and co-workers quantified the migration to repeated electrical interconnects for mainstream microprocessors. = Beyond CMOS computing = He oversaw Dr. Dmitri Nikonov et al. for a uniform bench marking to identify the technology options in spintronics, tunnel junction and photonics devices.

Originally assigned to carry passengers and mail between London and Australia, she was later assigned to routes between London and British India. On 16 March 1912 the ship collided in the Strait of Dover with the Pisagua, a German-registered four-masted steel-hulled barque. As a result Oceana sank off Beachy Head on the East Sussex coast, with the loss of 17 lives. Construction Commissioned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company from the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast as Yard No.201, the vessel was launched on 17 September 1887, and handed over from fitting out after running trials on 26 February 1888. The ship had a beam of , four masts, two funnels and a single propeller. Her three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine produced , giving her a top speed of . She had accommodation for 250 first class passengers and 159 second class, and 4,000 mtons cargo capacity. Operations Oceana made her maiden voyage from London on 19 March 1888, sailing to Melbourne and Sydney via Colombo, Ceylon. After upgrading and refitting in 1904, she began her last voyage on this passage on 12 May 1905, after which she was placed on the London to Bombay route. Author Mark Twain traveled from Sydney to Ceylon aboard Oceana in 1895 as part of his travels described in Following the Equator. He remarked of the ship: This 'Oceana' is a stately big ship, luxuriously appointed. She has spacious promenade decks. Large rooms; a surpassingly comfortable ship. The officers' library is well selected; a ship's library is not usually that . . . . For meals, the bugle call, man-of-war fashion; a pleasant change from the terrible gong. Mark Twain, Following the Equator, Ch. 37 Sinking Pisagua after the collision with Oceana On 15 March 1912 Oceana finished loading for her next trip to Bombay in the Port of Tilbury, under the command of Captain Thomas H. Hyde, RNR. Aboard were 41 passengers, a complement of 220 crew and a pilot. She was also carrying ¬£747,110 worth of gold and silver ingots: ¬£3 million at 2010 values. The next day she was proceeding west through the Strait of Dover at nearly full speed. The sea was calm although there was a strong headwind. In the opposite direction approached the Pisagua, a 2850-ton German-registered four-masted steel-hulled barque. Commissioned, owned and operated by F. Laeisz of Hamburg, she was on her way from Mejillones, Chile to Hamburg with a cargo of nitrate, sailing under full sail at a speed of almost . The two ships sighted each other when they were about a apart. The captain of Pisagua burnt a warning flare, which was seen by the crew and senior officer on duty on the bridge of Oceana, who then gave the order to turn to port. The pilot from Tilbury and for the Strait of Dover, Mr Penny, who was board Oceana in the charthouse, came to the bridge and realized that this manoeuvre would not be enough to avert a collision. He called \\"hard to port\\", but before Oceana could get out of the course, Pisagua struck Oceana amidships, making a gash in her side. The collision was off of Beachy Head. The pilot ordered the immediate closure of all the watertight bulkhead doors on Oceana, whilst the captain ordered all crew and passengers to their boat stations to stand by to abandon ship. Sending out an immediate distress signal, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway passenger ferry attended the scene, while two other paddle steamers and RMS Ruahine stood by. While awaiting rescue, the crew tried to lower one of the lifeboats, but it crashed into the sea and capsized, resulting in the loss of seven passengers and ten crew. Sussex managed to take on board 241 of the remaining passengers and crew. Although listing, Oceana was taken in tow by the Newhaven tug Alert, stern first, at 08:00. But by 10:00 she had developed an adverse list, enough to raise her propeller out of the water. Captain Hyde and the crew who had stayed aboard to help the tow now abandoned ship to the Alert, and watched from the tug as she sank in less than 20 minutes. Oceana sank close to the seaside resort town of Eastbourne in shallow water, settling on the sea bed with her masts and the tops of her funnels showing out of the sea at low tide. Pisagua drifted off leeward after the collision, but managed to survive with severe damage to the bow and foremast. Towed to Dover for immediate sea-going repairs, she was then towed to Hamburg where she was condemned. She was rebuilt as a whale factory ship and operated by S√∏ren L. Christensen,. On 12 February 1913, Pisagua was stranded at Low Island, South Shetland Islands. Although insured for NOK 318,000, she was subsequently condemned and written off at a loss to her owners. After the sinking, P&O; sued Laeisz, claiming damages for the loss of Oceana. Judgement was given that Pisagua was not at fault, due to a combination of factors, including that Oceana was obliged to give way to Pisagua under the \\"steam gives way to sail\\" rule. The subsequent Board of Trade Inquiry, which reported on 13 July 1912, reached similar conclusions, suspended the chief officer's certificate of competancy for six months and censured the master. Bullion salvage The day after the collision and ship's sinking, P&O; agreed with the insurers' salvage team to send divers to recover the gold and silver ingots. Divers initially entered the Captain's cabin and opened his safe, to recover the keys to the ship's five strongrooms. This enabled them to open three of the five strongrooms, while the other two were opened with a lump hammer and cold chisel. The salvage operation lasted ten days. A notable history item of the day, the salvage operation was filmed by George Albert Smith of Brighton, using his new and innovative \\"Kinemacolor\\" system, the first successful colour motion picture process. Wreck In July 1912 the Royal Navy blew up the wreck as it posed a danger to shipping. Oceana is today a popular wreck diving site. east from Newhaven at , at low tide the wreck lies in less than of water, upright and standing above the sea bed. Resting on an even keel on a gravel seabed, the bows are upright and mostly intact. Her superstructure has collapsed, but her sides are vertical and complete with portholes. Divers can see inside the engine room from above to see the four boilers and the triple-expansion steam engine. Being close to the shore, the wreck attracts a large amount of sea life. Divers have found single gold and silver ingots since, the last being recovered in 1996. The ship was carrying a memorial plaque to 800 men of the 1st Nottingham Regiment who had died in India from 1819 to 1838, mainly from local diseases. The plaque was recovered by divers Geoff and Jamie Smith from the Tunbridge Wells Sub-Aqua Club in August 2009, and after restoration and preservation presented to 2nd Battalion the Mercian Regiment in October 2009. It is currently displayed in the regimental museum in Nottingham Castle.

Established in 1968, the school was merged in 1982 with Dover Heights Girls High School to form Dover Heights High School, which was subsequently merged in 2003 with Vaucluse High School to form Rose Bay Secondary College. History Dover Heights Boys High School traces its origins back to the Bondi Public School located in Wellington Street Bondi. Until 1944, Bondi Public served as both a primary and high school. In 1944, high school girls were moved to the new Dover Heights Home Science High School in Hardy Street Dover Heights. Post primary boys continued on at Wellington Street - to be known as Bondi Junior Technical School, 1942‚Äì63, and Bondi Junior High until 1969 when it was moved to a new building in Blake Street which was Dover Heights Boys' High School. Thus the Wellingtion Street school returned to the original name of Bondi Public School, becoming once again a primary school only. As Bondi Junior Technical School, it only catered for boys from 1st to 4th form (year 7 to year 10), the Principal being Mr Cook. Late in 1967 Mr Doyle became the Principal. Since Mr Doyle was well placed in the education department, he pushed for a selective boys high school and in 1968 had the school renamed Bondi Boys High School. Mr Doyle was once asked why the senior girls from Dover Heights Girls High and senior boys from Vaucluse Boys High could not move to the Blake Street site, and instead move the junior boys to Vaucluse. His response was that the school would be a selective school for boys in the area only. Construction of the Blake St site commenced at the beginning of that year and completed for the start of the school year in 1969, when it was officially opened. During the 1970s it was known for applying corporal punishment beyond a reasonable measure, although during the period 1967 to 1972 this form of punishment was being phased out, with Masters only being able to administer such punishment. From 1971 onwards this was left to the Deputy Principal and Principal The school's demise in 1982 was the result of falling enrolments. The likely reason for this was the changing demographics of nearby suburbs such as Bondi, Bronte and Clovelly which were originally working-class and thus a ready source of students for the state school system. The baby-boomer years (1945-1964) no doubt placed much pressure on the school system in the area and this may explain the reason for Dover Heights Boys' High School and Vaucluse Boys' High School (opened 1969 and 1960 respectively) coming into being. However, the 1970s saw these working-class families move to the more affordable western suburbs of Sydney and this, quiet naturally had a detrimental effect on local state-school populations. In 1982 the school was merged with Dover Heights Girls High School to form the Dover Heights High School on the campus of the girls' school. At the same time, Vaucluse Boys' High School became co-educational and renamed Vaucluse High School. The old Dover Heights Boys High School site was then offered for sale to Moriah College. This caused some controversy at the time and the sale did not proceed. From 1986 to 1995, this site was occupied by Dover Heights College of TAFE. It is now the site of the Kesser Torah, a Jewish day school. =Former Principals= * F.A. Doyle * L.J. Bailey * M.A. Field * G.

The QCR is not commonly used in the practice of statistics; rather, it is a useful tool in statistics education because it can be used as an intermediate step in the development of Pearson's correlation coefficient.  Definition and properties  To calculate the QCR, the data are divided into quadrants based on the mean of the X and Y variables. The formula for calculating the QCR is then: : q=\\\\frac{n(\\\\text{Quadrant I})+n(\\\\text{Quadrant III})-n(\\\\text{Quadrant II})-n(\\\\text{Quadrant IV})}{N}, where \\\\text{n(Quadrant)} is the number of observations in that quadrant and N is the total number of observations. The QCR is always between ‚àí1 and 1. Values near ‚àí1, 0, and 1 indicate strong negative association, no association, and strong positive association (as in Pearson's correlation coefficient). However, unlike Pearson's correlation coefficient the QCR may be ‚àí1 or 1 without the data exhibiting a perfect linear relationship.  Example  Category 5 Hurricanes showing the relationship between wind speed (X) and pressure (Y). The blue and green lines represent the means of the X and Y values, respectively. The Quadrants have been labeled. The points have been jittered to reduce overlap of observations. The scatterplot shows the maximum wind speed (X) and minimum pressure (Y) for 35 Category 5 Hurricanes. The mean wind speed is 170 mph (indicated by the blue line), and the mean pressure is 921.31 hPa (indicated by the green line). There are 6 observations in Quadrant I, 13 observations in Quadrant II, 5 observations in Quadrant III, and 11 observations in Quadrant IV. Thus, the QCR for these data is \\\\frac{(6+5)-(13+11)}{35}=-0.37, indicating a moderate negative relationship between wind speed and pressure for these hurricanes.

The species is known from a Late Oligocene to Early Miocene location in southern Mexico. Unlike the coeval extinct species Hymenaea mexicana and Hymenaea protera which are placed closer to the living species Hymenaea verrucosum of Africa, H. allendis is closer in relation to the neotropical species of Hymenaea. History and classification Hymenaea allendis is known from a solitary fossil flower which is an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Mexican amber. The specimen is currently housed in the Eliseo Palacios Aguilera Paleontological Museum in Chiapas, Mexico. Mexican amber is recovered from fossil-bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico. The amber dates from between 22.5 million years old, for the youngest sediments of the Balumtun Sandstone, and 26 million years old for the oldest La Quinta Formation. This age range straddles the boundary between the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene and is complicated by both formations being secondary deposits for the amber; the age range is therefore only the youngest that it might be. The fossil was examined by paleobotanists Laura Calvillo-Canadell and Sergio Cevallos-Ferriz of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and Lourdes Rico-Arce of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, United Kingdom; Calvillo-Canadell, Cevallos-Ferriz and Rico-Arce's description of the species was published in a 2010 article in the Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology. The etymology of the chosen specific name allendis is in reference to the town Simojovel de Allende which is located within the amber mining area. When described, H. allendis was the second Hymenaea species to be identified from fossils found in Mexican amber. The first species was Hymenaea mexicana, which was described by Poinar and Brown 2002, and which was to be the source for the resin which Mexican amber is derived from. Both H. protera, found in Dominican amber, and H. mexicana are placed closer to the single living old-world species, H. verrucosum, which is placed in the Hymenaea sect. Trachylobium. The smooth ovary with a small stipe and wide nectariferous disc are traits found only in the new world Hymenaea section Hymenaea. Description The flower of H. allendis is small, with a hairy long and wide pedicel and as with H. mexicana the flower is bisexual. The preserved sepals are urn-shaped, showing a distinct row of hairs along the middle of the sepal underside and a smooth upper surface. The sepals form a calyx around the wide hypanthium. The sepals of the single flower described are detached which may be the result of an early caducous condition, which makes the total number of sepals born uncertain. Preserved stamens which were dislodged from the flower during entombment in the resin show two rows of bilocular anthers on their upper surfaces. The possibly elliptic-ovate petals distinguish the species from the living species Hymenaea courbaril.

Built in 1731, it is the oldest bridge in New Jersey. Spanning the Green Brook, it connects Bound Brook (Somerset County) and Middlesex Borough (Middlesex County) in northern central New Jersey. It also carried the Great Road Up Raritan, laid out in 1681, which was created by an act of the assembly of the Province of East Jersey.National Register of Historic Places Database, Road Up Raritan Historic District Registration Form http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=0 In 1764, the colonial highway, west of what is now Lambertville on the Delaware River and east of Elizabethtown Point on Newark Bay, was christened Old York Road. The highway represented the shortest route between Philadelphia and New York City (reached by ferry). It was built shortly after the King's Highway and called a variety of names, but it was most prominently known as the Upper Road when the Assunpink Trail was widened.New Jersey Historic Road Survey, New Jersey Department of Transportation, 2011 The bridge allowed farmers, plantation owners, and all those west and north of the Raritan River a direct route to the colonial ports of New Brunswick and Raritan Landing. Since the early 1870s, the Old Stone Arch Bridge has been buried up to the parapets, due to the construction of a railroad embankment. Description The bridge, supposedly made from locally quarried rough-hewn masonry and stone, is a classic, 3-arch edifice. The center span is approximately 17.9 feet wide with two side arches that are approximately 12 feet 6 inches and 12 feet 3 inches, to the west and east respectively. Only a sign, often hidden behind weeds, wild bushes and large trucks or trailers that park alongside it, identifies what lies beneath. The roadway between the exposed south and non-visible north parapet, which may at some point have been widened, is approximately 26 feet in width. It is about 79 feet 6 inches long, more than the Pennypack Creek Bridge. Only the south parapet and a varying-sized spandrel, 4 feet in the center and 6 feet at each end, are visible. This is believed to indicate that prior to the original roadway's flattening, it was a typical humpback or camelback bridge.National Register of Historic Places Continuation Sheet. Application for listing of Old Stone Arch Bridge. A concrete barrier was installed several years ago to protect the south parapet. The novelty of the bridge remains additionally reinforced by the fact that the first bridges in New Jersey, constructed within colonial times, were a few logs dropped across a stream with sawn timbers fastened to them to provide a flat, relatively even surface, with the occasional inclusion of a handrail. Most were funded by local municipalities.New Jersey Historic Highway Roadway Study, New Jersey Department of Transportation, January 2011New Jersey Historical Bridge Survey‚Äù New Jersey Department of Transportation, Bureau of Environmental Analysis, and The Federal Highway Administration, New Jersey Division (September 1994) Today in New Jersey, almost exclusively in the central and northern portions of the state in or close to mountainous terrain where stone is abundant, numerous stone arch bridges exist. The large majority of these were constructed between the 1820s and early 1900s. There are few in the southern portions of the state, perhaps resulting from smaller quantities of congestion and less abundant stone.

From there it followed a variety of existing roads southwest toward the Delaware River; further evidence that the highway was known by that name was provided in 1936 by Cornelius C. Vermeule in his Raritan Landing That Was, 1675‚Äì1875 (1936) which provided a road map he drew to recreate the route.See also Harold E. Pickersgill and John Patrick Wall History of Middlesex County, New Jersey, 1664-1920, These routes were accompanied at the time via the modern road known as State Route 27, south of Princeton, New Jersey, which originally extended to Salem; designated the \\"Old Salem Road\\", the portion of the route which crossed the bride carries the name today, though the route possesses several additional names, including the \\"Asapink Trail,\\" \\"Upper Road,\\" \\"Old Dutch Road\\" and the \\"Lincoln Highway\\". It was originally known as \\"Lawrie's Road\\" or \\"Lower Road\\"; the third member constituted what is a portion of today's River Road, extending from Piscataway to Bound Brook. As early as the late 17th century, starting in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, a highway, known as Old York Road, began from Philadelphia to New Hope on the Delaware River across from one of the major ferries to New Jersey.New Hope, PA, Coryell‚Äôs Ferry In the Revolution The highway was conceived by a petition to Governor Charles Gookin and his council in 1691 by the Cheltenham settlers, asking that a road be built between the Delaware River and Philadelphia, resulting in a 1711 survey.Anne de Bennevile Maears, The old York road; and its early associations and biography 1670-1870 (Harper & Brothers, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 1890) From 1711 to 1772 it was constructed and ran from Central Philadelphia to Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth) Point. The main road still exists under a variety of other names, but a large portion still has that name in Pennsylvania and New Jersey from Lambertville to HillsboroughJames and Margaret Cawley. Along The Old York Road, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, NJ (1965) It was formally accepted and authorized after a 1762 road survey conducted by Somerset County that ended with its eastern terminus in that county as \\"to middle of Bound Brook Stone Bridge\\".Emogene Van Sickel, The Old York Road and its Stage Coach Days (1936) and New Jersey State Archives Being the shortest route from Philadelphia to New York City, Old York Road was selected by the Swift Sure Stagecoach line, a stagecoach company which was granted a franchise via the 2 states.Emogene Van Sickle The Old York Road and Its Stage Coach Days, D. H. Moureauu Publisher, Flemington, NJ 1936 It ran well into the middle of the 19th century, until the development of efficient railroad lines. The Old Stage Inn on Front Street and Park Avenue in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, built in 1737, was one of the original taverns and stage coach stops, known as \\"ordinaries\\", where mail was dropped off and passengers could receive food, drink, additional perishables and rest for the duration of the night; it currently remains in business south of U.S 22, with a memorial marker on a small boulder next to a flagpole on Front Street just in front of the inn.  Impact of the Raritan Landing  The Old Stone Arch Bridge needed to be built in the first place for no greater reason than the fact the Green Brook presented an uncrossable obstacle for hunters, farmers, tradesmen and all other travelers between northwest New Jersey and all points west who chose to follow the major east‚Äìwest river in the state. The old highway is memorialized in Hunterdon County, NJIn the early 18th century, traveling along the northern bank of the Raritan westward from Somerset County required crossing the Green Brook, which divided above its confluence with the Raritan River it from Middlesex County. Unlike many other rivers and waterway crossings in the colonies, and New Jersey in particular, there was no established ferry. So it was literally impossible to cross the brook without taking an extremely long and time-consuming northern bypass. This became particularly a problem because of the emergence of the ports of New Brunswick and Raritan Landing across from each other on the river. Raritan Landing emerged as a vital port community during the 1720s. It was situated at the farthest inland point on the Raritan River that could be navigated by merchant ships of the day. In its heyday, the landing was the center for local trade and, along with New Brunswick, served as a hub for imports and exports to and from the Raritan Valley. By the 1740s, there were approximately 70 structures and more than 100 inhabitants. By the end of the Revolutionary War it had become insignificant, after being ravished by the invading British armies and overshadowed by New Brunswick, where the river was deeper.Cornelius C. Vermeule Raritan Landing That Was, The History of a River Port from 1675 to 1875, originally read before the New Brunswick Historical Club on April 17, 1930 Burial The Old Stone Arch Bridge is obscurely located along what is no more than a rough road driveway to a warehouse occupied by trucking company. The third oldest-span stone arch bridge that carries the historic Kings Highway over Stony Brook between Princeton and Lawrenceville was built in 1792, and although after the colonial era, it is part of an early and important regional thoroughfare. The Somerset County Cultural and Heritage Commission, the Board of Chosen Freeholders in the county and their site coordinator, Thomas d'Amico, commissioned a feasibility study that included excavating portions of the structure that were buried in the early 1870s, when the second of three railroad lines passed via Bound Brook.French & Parrello Associates, P.A, Consulting Engineers ‚ÄúReport Feasibility Study for the Rehabilitation of Bridge No. HO 711 Historic Stone Arch Bridge (Circa 1731) The results were that they found the bridge, despite its burial for greater than approximately 140 years; the portion of the brook it spanned it, which flowed into the Raritan River approximately 100 yards to the south, was at that same time redirected, allowing for the formation of dry ground beneath the bridge.  Rediscovery and proposed unearthing and preservation  The bridge additionally remained significant for approximately 140 years prior to its burial; however, its significance ended when, during the early 1870s, it was superseded as the premiere land route across the Green Brook via newly constructed railroads. However, it is planned for memorialisation as the central point of what has been suggested to be the Old Stone Bridge Park by the borough.Bound Bridge Redevopement Plan, 2012 Until recently even its approximate date of construction remained uncertain, but state records have now been found that validate its approximate building date, with the provincial legislature authorising the construction of a bridge within the area in 1727 and 1728: \\"There shall be a Bridge built over the Bound-Brook, in the most commodious place on the North-East-Side of the Road, as it now lies from Piscataway, in the County of Middlesex, up Raritan River\\".Laws of the Royal Colony of New Jersey, Vol. 2, New Jersey State Library, Archives and History Bureau, Trenton, New Jersey) Construction of this bridge reportedly had not begun by 1730, when the legislature passed a supplementary act to clarify the intent of the earlier law regarding the Bound Brook bridge: ‚ÄúWhereas the Bridge to be built over Bound Brook... has hitherto met with Obstructions, arising from Mistakes concerning the Meaning and Intention of the said [1727/28] Act: ... That as soon as conveniently may be after the Publication of this Act, there shall be a Bridge built over the Bound Brook, on the most commodious Place on the North East Side of the Road now used, as it lies from Piscataway, in the County of Middlesex, up Raritan River, which Road, as the same is now [utilised], shall be deemed and taken for the Road or High-way and good and sufficient Causeways laid... one Third Part at the Expence [sic] of the County of Middlesex. ..The other two Third Parts thereof at the Expence [sic] of the County of Somerset.‚Äù No records have been discovered to prove exactly when the bridge was actually constructed, though all evidence points to 1731. 450px A legislative act of 1760 regulating roads and bridges clearly references this arrangement, stating: \\"two Stone Bridges and a Causeway have been built near the Mouth of Bound-Brook\\" The second stone bridge referenced in the act was located at the eastern end of the causeway. This structure extended over the tail race for the neighboring gristmill. The exact construction date of the gristmill is unknown; however, it is believed to predate the bridges and causeway. A 1766 map of Somerset County depicts the gristmill on the Raritan Road, upstream from the causeway, and attributes it to \\"Fields.‚Äù Michael Field, a miller and merchant in Bound Brook, was most likely the operator of the gristmill on Green Brook. Field did not then own the property, but the land had belonged to his family as early as the 1720s. The gristmill was likely built either during the tenure of Michael's father, Jeremiah (1729-1747), or his brother, also Jeremiah, prior to 1765Hunter Research, Newark, NJ Hunter Research was commissioned by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been analyzing the problem and gradually attempting to resolve the borough's catastrophic historic flooding disasters to write a brochure entitled \\"Saving Bound Brook. Where the Green Brook Meets The Raritan\\" was also commissioned to analyze creating a large historic district about a decade ago. It considered and proposed including the bridge, another at the end of the long-destroyed causeway that spanned the new leg of the Green Brook that flowed into the Raritan and a few other structures on the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the National Park Service. That bridge, a ‚ÄúWarren-truss‚Äù iron bridge typical of many that were built, some of which still survive in New Jersey was built in 1894. It replaced a wooden ‚Äúkings post‚Äù crossing that replaced the second stone bridge only a decade before. The company speculated that the kings post bridge only lasted such a short period of time because it was not made to last long being made of wood and because of that was not particularly study. It also theorized that since along this route a trolley service began around the same time operated by the Brunswick Traction Company a larger, stronger structure was needed.Evaluating The National Register of Historic Places Eligibility of Three Bridges and A Railroad Spur, June 2002, Hunter Research, Trenton, NJ. In 1932, with the construction of a larger, more modern bridge financed by both counties along East Main Street which became Lincoln Avenue at its eastern end in Middlesex Borough in Middlesex County, all road traffic was diverted to that bridge. About the same time the trolleys went out of service. The Warren- truss bridge due to wear, probable flooding and what appears to be lack of proper maintenance was considered a hazard and was closed. For all intents and purposes this ended the 301-year life of the original historic Philadelphia to New York City highway that crossed the bridge as that portion of the creek is again impassable as it was before 1731.Evaluating The National Register of Historic Places Eligibility of Three Bridges and A Railroad Spur, June 2002, Hunter Research, (Trenton, NJ) =Role in the Revolutionary War= Even before all of the information above came to light, the Old Stone Arch Bridge that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 as a national landmark. It achieved that recognition in large part because as most of the small, descriptive sign states, it played an important role in the war. In 1777 a force of British soldiers that had marched under color of darkness during the middle of the night from New Brunswick and surprised the much smaller contingent of American troops and rag-tag militia members in the Battle of Bound Brook. Legend or at least the diary of one of the British soldiers stated that they were held at bay due to 'murderous fire\\" from their enemy who were positioned in a garrison near the bridge. This minor skirmish apparently lasted no more than \\"eight to ten minutes\\" according to his diary when the Americans abandoned their position as more British reinforcements appeared. Future If the cultural and heritage commissions and Somerset County and the Borough of Bound Bridge produce a conclusive decision in association with governing bodies within the region, the bridge and a Stone Bridge Park when the bridge is unearthed and restored will be the highlight of a Raritan River Park that will extend the length of that county along the north banks of the River. The combined plans call for an ambitious greenway and park along the entirety of the northern banks of the river within that county and the Borough of Bound Brook Bridge will have and enjoy its historic river front restored, which will necessitate the rerouting of the southern railroad line and removing the embankment that has been a barrier with the riverfront and downtown Bound Brook for over 140 years.

Dedman on November 11, 1957, and construction began on Brookhaven Country Club in the Farmers Branch suburb of Dallas. Legendary golfer and famous Texan, Byron Nelson, served as the chairman of the advisory board during construction. Brookhaven held an open-house in 1959 to show off the 26,000 square foot informal wing. In 1965, ClubCorp expanded to include city clubs, similar to country clubs but without golf courses. By the 1970s, ClubCorp served as the management consultant for more than 50 private clubs. In 1971, The University Club of Houston opens (Texas) near the Galleria complex and is the world's first indoor climate-controlled tennis complex. In the 1970s ClubCorp offered reciprocal privileges, meaning a member of any ClubCorp club could attend other clubs. In 1975, they bought 13 additional clubs, including the Inverrary Country Club, home to the PGA Tour. In 1976, ClubCorp Realty is formed to develop residential communities around country clubs. In 1981, ClubCorp acquired Firestone Country Club in Akron, OH, from the Firestone Family. Shortly after, in 1984, the company bought golf courses, hotels and other properties in Pinehurst, North Carolina. After acquiring Pinehurst Resort, ClubResorts was founded for the management of destination golf and conference resorts. Resort Guests are treated as \\"Members for their Stay.\\" They also bought Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California and Indian Wells Country Club in Indian Wells, California, Gleneagles Country Club in West Plano, Texas, Stonebriar Country Club in Frisco, Texas and Las Colinas Country Club in Irving, Texas. They also bought The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia in 1993, Barton Creek, Austin, Texas and Daufuskie Island off Hilton Head, South Carolina. In 1986, ClubCorp began publishing Private Clubs magazine as a vehicle for communicating to members. In 1998, Private Clubs earned the distinction of having the most affluent audience in America. In 1998, ClubCorp entered into an agreement for Golden Bear International, Jack Nicklaus's company, to design 36 new golf courses, co-owned and operated by ClubCorp. In 1999, they partnered with the American Golf Corporation to buy 45 properties from Cobblestone Golf for $393 million. It also became ClubLink Corp.'s largest shareholder for $32.5 million; ClubLink Corp. owned 23 golf courses in Canada. It has also partnered with PGA European Tour to build more golf courses outside the United States. In 2014, ClubCorp acquired Sequoia Golf Holdings, Inc. for $265 million, expanding its portfolio by 30 percent. The 50 owned-and-operated clubs included The Woodlands Country Club, home of the Champions Tour's Insperity Invitational. In March 2017, ClubCorp announced the acquisition of the Rockville, Maryland-based club, Norbeck Country Club. The acquisition was the third of the year. Timeline 1957: Robert H.

Advances in physically based animation are often motivated by the need to include complex, physically inspired behaviors in video games, interactive simulations, and movies. Although off-line simulation methods exist to solve most all of the problems studied in physically-based animation, these methods are intended for applications that necessitate physical accuracy and slow, detailed computations. In contrast to methods common in offline simulation, techniques in physically based animation are concerned with physical plausibility, numerical stability, and visual appeal over physical accuracy. Physically based animation is often limited to loose approximations of physical behaviors because of the strict time constraints imposed by interactive applications. The target frame rate for interactive applications such as games and simulations is often 25-60 hertz, with only a small fraction of the time allotted to an individual frame remaining for physical simulation. Simplified models of physical behaviors are generally preferred if they are more efficient, easier to accelerate (through pre-computation, clever data structures, or SIMD/GPGPU), or satisfy desirable mathematical properties (such as unconditional stability or volume conservation when a soft body undergoes deformation). Fine details are not important when the overriding goal of a visualization is aesthetic appeal or the maintenance of player immersion since these details are often difficult for humans to notice or are otherwise impossible to distinguish at human scales. History Physically based animation is now common in movies and video games, and many techniques were pioneered during the development of early special effects scenes and game engines. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan famously used particle systems in the Genesis explosion scene to create the visual effect of a flaming shockwave engulfing a planet. Despite being released before physics engines were a common feature in games, System Shock incorporated rigid body physics in its engine and was widely considered innovative for this feature and the novel sense of interaction it afforded players. Valve later developed Half-Life and used rigid body physics to create environmental puzzles for the player, such as obstacles that could not be reached without stacking boxes. Half-Life 2 featured a more advanced physics engine that incorporated constrained systems such as pulleys or levers with more environmental puzzles to showcase these features. Physics engines are now much more common in games, and their frequent appearance has motivated research in physically based animation by companies such as Nvidia. Physically based animation in games and simulations Physically based animation is common in games and simulations where users have the expectation of interaction with the environment. Physics engines such as Havok, PhysX, and Bullet exist as separately developed products to be licensed and included in games. In games such as Angry Birds or World of Goo, physically based animation is itself the primary game mechanic and players are expected to interact with or create physically simulated systems in order to achieve goals. Aspects of physics puzzle games exist in many games that belong to other genres but feature physically based simulation. Allowing physical interaction with the environment through physically based animation promotes non-linear solutions to puzzles by players, and can sometimes results in solutions to problems presented in games that were not deliberately included by level designers. Simulations used for purposes other than entertainment, such as military simulations, also make use of physically based animation to portray realistic situations and maintain the immersion of users. Many techniques in physically based animation are designed with GPGPU implementations in mind or can otherwise be extended to benefit from graphics hardware, which can be used to make physically based simulations fast enough for gaming. GPU time is often reserved for rendering, however, and frequent data transfers between the host and device can easily become a bottleneck to performance. Physically based animation in movies Simulations can be performed offline (as in apart from when they are viewed) in the development of special effects for movies. Speed is therefore not strictly a necessity in the production of special effects but is still desirable for reasonably responsive feedback and because the hardware required for slower methods is more expensive. However, physically based animation is still preferred because slower, more accurate methods can be costly and limiting. The physical accuracy of small details in a special effect are not meaningful to their visual appeal, restrict the amount of control that artists and directors can exert over behavior, and increase the monetary cost and time required to achieve results. It is necessary to be able to dictate the high level behavior of physically inspired effects in movies in order to achieve a desired artistic direction, but scripting physical behaviors on the level of small details can be unfeasible when fluids, smoke, or many individual objects are involved. Physically based animation generally affords more artist control over the appearance of simulated results and is also more convenient when desired effects might bend or defy physics. Sub Topics=Rigid Body Simulation= Simplified rigid body physics is relatively cheap and easy to implement, which is why it appeared in interactive games and simulations earlier than most other techniques. Rigid bodies are assumed to undergo no deformation during simulation so that rigid body motion between time steps can be described as a translation and rotation, traditionally using affine transformations stored as 4x4 matrices. Alternatively, quaternions can be used to store rotations and vectors can be used to store the objects offset from the origin. The most computationally expensive aspects of rigid body dynamics are collision detection, correcting interpenetration between bodies and the environment, and handling resting contact. Rigid bodies are commonly simulated iteratively, with back-tracking to correct error using smaller timesteps. Resting contact between multiple rigid bodies (as is the case when rigid bodies fall into piles or are stacked) can be particularly difficult to handle efficiently and may require complex contact and shock propagation graphs in order to resolve using impulse-based methods. When simulating large numbers of rigid bodies, simplified geometries or convex hulls are often used to represent their boundaries for the purpose of collision detection and response (since this is generally the bottleneck in simulation). =Soft Body Simulation= Soft bodies can easily be implemented using spring-mesh systems. Spring mesh systems are composed of individually simulated particles that are attracted to each other by simulated spring forces and experience resistance from simulated dampeners. Arbitrary geometries can be more easily simulated by applying spring and dampener forces to the nodes of a lattice and deforming the object with the lattice. However, explicit solutions to these systems are not very numerically stable and are extremely difficult to control the behavior of through spring parameters. Techniques that allow for physically plausible and visually appealing soft bodies, are numerically stable, and can be configured well by artists were prohibitively expensive in early gaming history, which is why soft bodies were not as common as rigid bodies. Integration using Runge-Kutta methods can be used to increase the numerical stability of unstable techniques such as spring meshes or finer time steps can be used for simulation (although this is more costly and cannot make spring meshes stable for arbitrarily large forces). Techniques such as shape matching and position based dynamics address these problems with interactive games and simulations in mind. Position based dynamics is used in mainstream game engines such as Bullet (software), Havok, and PhysX. Unconditional stability and ease of configuration are particularly desirable properties of soft body simulations that can be difficult to achieve with spring-mesh systems, although they are still often used in games because of their simplicity and speed. =Fluid Simulation= Computational fluid dynamics can be expensive, and interactions between multiple fluid bodies or with external objects/forces can require complex logic to evaluate. Fluid simulation is generally achieved in video games by simulating only the height of bodies of water to create the effect of waves, ripples, or other surface features. For relatively free bodies of liquid, Lagrangian or semi-Lagrangian methods are often used to speed up the simulation by treating particles as finite elements of fluid (or carriers of physical properties) and approximating the Navier-Stokes equations . It is uncommon to simulate bodies of fluid in games, although surface features may be simulated using similar methods and fluid simulations may be used to generate textures or height-fields to render water in real-time without real-time simulation (this is commonly done for large bodies of water in games). Fluid simulations can be computed using commodity graphics hardware through GPGPU, and height fields can be efficiently computed that result in wave-like behavior using Lattice Boltzmann methods. Alternatively, surface features and waves can be simulated as particles and a height field generated from the simulated particles in real-time. This also allows for efficient two way interaction between the fluid and floating objects. =Particle Systems= Particle systems are an extremely popular technique for creating visual effects in movies and games because of their ease of implementation, efficiency, extensibility, and artist control. The update cycle of particle systems usually consists of the three phases: generation, simulation, and extinction. These phases respectively consist of the introduction of new particles, simulating them through the next timestep, and removing particles that have exceeded their life-span. The physical and visual attributes of particles are usually randomized on generation with the range and distribution of attributes controlled by the artist. Particle systems can further be made to generate particle systems themselves to create more complex and dynamic effects, and their high-level behavior can be choreographed through a framework of operators as in the canonical Sims paper. Early games that rendered systems of particles suffered from clipping artifacts when particles partially intersected geometry in the environment, and this artifact was especially noticeable for large particles (which were often used to stand in for smoke). Soft particles address these artifacts through careful shading and manipulation of the transparency of particles, such that particles become more transparent as they approach surfaces. =Flocking= In physically based animation, flocking refers to a technique that models the complex behavior of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects using virtual forces. These virtual forces simulate the tendency for flocks to center their velocities, avoid collisions and crowding, and move toward the group. In these simulations, individual members of the flock (sometimes called boids, short for bird-oid) act without collaboration using only information about the position and velocity of their peers to create the illusion of synchronized, group behavior efficiently. Flocking can be used to efficiently approximate the behavior of crowds of humans as well, and methods based on flocking are often used for crowds of NPCs in gaming. Unreal and Half-Life were among the first games to implement flocking, which was used to model the behavior of birds and flying creatures present in outdoor levels. =Physically Based Character Animation= Characters in games and simulations are traditionally animated through methods such as keyframing that define animations through compositions of smaller, static motions sequenced to convey more complex behavior. Visually, these static methods cannot easily convey complex interactions with the environment and make lifelike character motion difficult to accomplish. Techniques in physically based character animation achieve dynamic animations that respond to user interaction, external events, and the environment by optimizing motions toward specified goals given physically based constraints such as energy minimization. The adoption of physically based character animation, as opposed to more static methods, has been slow in the gaming industry due to the increased cost and complexity associated with its use. Physically based character animation has been used in the Skate (video game) series of video games, and in the independently developed first- person shooter StarForge.

Forest conservation involves the upkeep of the natural resources within a forest that are beneficial for both humans and the ecosystem. Forest conservation acts to maintain, plan, and improve forested areas. Forests provide wildlife with a suitable habitat for living along with filtering groundwater and preventing runoff. History Around the year 1900 in the United States, Gifford Pinchot lead a movement of conservation. Gifford Pinchot made conservation a popular word in its application to natural resources. Throughout the next two decades, forestry professions became widespread. Following World War I, forestry became a cooperation between private landowners, the states, and the federal government. On March 21, 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a message to the United States Congress to strengthen the United States forest resources. In the following days, congress enacted the establishment of emergency conservation work. This project consisted of twenty five thousand men working on forest protection by planting trees, watershed restoration and erosion control. About 2.2 billion seedlings were planted which marked a start of conservation in the United States. In 1935, the Natural Resources Committee was created to understand, plan and use natural resources. Following World War II, the first Smokey Bear symbol appeared on a poster to represent a fire prevention cooperation. The Smokey Bear icon soon became one of the best advertisement icons in the United States. When people started to realize that the resources were not unlimited within the forests, conservation efforts began to start. Forest types There are many different types of forests. The many types of forests are categorized by climate and location. 98% of forest cover in the United States is natural with the remaining 2% being plantation land. 33% of the United States is made up of forests. Out of the 33% of the U.S. covered by forests, 37% make up subtropical forests. 48% make up temperate forests. The remaining 15% consist of boreal forests. =Boreal= Boreal forests are found in the northern regions of the United States. Canada is made up of boreal forests. These forests have long cold winters and short cool summers. Precipitation can reach over 200 centimeters per year typically in the form of snow. Because of the cold climate in the boreal forests, the growing season is 3 months long. Boreal forests are made up of evergreen trees, mosses, and lichens. Mosses are a plant species that thrive in areas that are moist. Mosses can tolerate dry periods as well by holding water and moisture in the dead leaves and cells. Lichens are organisms in the form of fungal filaments. Algae is a form of lichen in the boreal forests. =Temperate= Temperate forests are forests with high levels of precipitation. The yearly precipitation rate is between 20 and 60 inches in the form of rain or snow. Temperatures in temperate forests range from -22 degrees Fahrenheit to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperate Forests within the United States are found on the Eastern region. Temperate forests are able to support a variety of species due to the large amount of rainfall. Mosses and lichens dominate the forest floor with medium size trees above such as dogwood trees. The top canopy is covered by larger trees such as maple trees, Birch trees, and Walnut trees. =Sub-tropical= Subtropical forests are found in the United States along the southern border states. These forests are made up of evergreen species and deciduous species. Evergreens are plant species that retain their leaves year round while deciduous trees lose their leaves annually. The consistent warm climate along with consistent rainfall promote more plant growth than any other environment in the United States. Forest threats Deforestation is a threat to forests according to foresters. Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests and woodlands. Deforestation is brought about by commercial logging, conversion of woodlands to agricultural land, and the felling of trees for firewood and building material. Commercial logging is that harvest of timber products for the profit that is gained from selling the product. Illegal logging is a threat to forests. Illegal logging is the harvest of timber for economic gain without permission. This method is a threat because it impedes plans and upkeep of a forest. Forests are lost to urban development and building projects. When forest are cleared for these reasons, it creates problems that foresters are concerned with. When heavy machinery is used to clear forests or develop land, the soil becomes compacted. When the soil is compacted, the soil particles are packed tightly together. Soil compaction results in water supply not being absorbed by tree roots and can be deadly to the growth of trees. Soil compaction also can create flooding. Compacted soil can not filter the groundwater into the soil, therefore water can build up on the surface creating flooding as a result. Species extinction is another threat to our forests. With the removal of forests, animal and plant species suffer. Animal species can not survive without the adequate needs of their lifestyle. Animals need cover, food, and safe areas for the reproduction process. Altering their environment disrupts the life cycle of animal species and they are oftentimes not able to adapt. Food sources are lost to deforestation. Animal species tend to consume plant life to maintain themselves. With the removal of forests this can result in animals not being able to find food in order to survive. Unmanaged recreational use is also a threat to forests. Unmanaged recreational use is the use of the forested lands by the public at an uncontrolled rate. As recreational use as increased among forests, foresters have noticed an increase in land management that is needed. Invasive species threaten forests ecosystems. Invasive species are any species that is not native to that ecosystem and economic harm along with harm to the environment. Invasive species cause disruptions in the function of the ecosystem. These species not only affect the plants within a forest, but they can affect the animals within an ecosystem as well. The financial impact cause by invasive species is 138 billion dollars per year with economic loss and control costs. Techniques Techniques of forest conservation are used to improve forested areas and to make the available resources sustainable. =Afforestation= Afforestation is a proactive method used to improve forests. Afforestation is the planting of trees for commercial purposes. The supply of wood and wood products from afforested areas has prevented the over use and destruction of natural forests. Instead of taking resources from existing natural forests, afforestation is a process used to plant trees and use them as resources instead of naturally existing forests. Afforestation occurs when the planting of trees is introduced to an area that previously had no trees. This creates habitat for wildlife, recreational areas, and commercial use while not causing harm to natural forests. =Reforestation= Reforestation is another method to sustain forests by improving existing forested areas. Reforestation is a method of planting trees in an existing forested area. This method is used in reaction to deforestation. When forests are removed without reestablishment they can be reforested by planting trees in the same area to rebuild the existing forest. =Selective logging= Selective logging is another method used to meet the needs of both the forests and humans seeking economical resources. Selective logging is the removal of trees within a stand based on size limitations. This technique allows for forest regeneration to occur between and after the selective harvest cycles. =Controlled burn= Although it can be threatening if it is not controlled, fire is a successful way to conserve forest resources. Controlled burn is a technique that is used to manage forests. Fire can be highly beneficial to the ecosystems within a forest. It renews the forest undergrowth and also stimulates the germination of tree species. In some species of trees, such as the Sequoia, seedlings remain dormant until broken by fire. As a result, these species can not reproduce without fire. =Wildlife management areas= State departments of natural resources and conservation develop, maintain, and manage public lands across the nation. Special regulations and rules apply on all wildlife management areas across the United States. Wildlife management areas are accessible to the public for many recreational uses. Hunters and campers enjoy the land to harvest wild game on a legal basis. Hunting is permitted on wildlife management areas but there are rules and regulations. A valid hunting license is required, and often a wildlife management area land use permit is also required. Along with public use of the wildlife management areas, State departments of natural resources provide necessary management to upkeep the land. The management techniques within a wildlife management area include developing habitat for wildlife along with conserving the natural land resources. Land resources within a wildlife management area are conserved by not allowing the harvest of tree species or alteration of the land in any way.

An aqueduct is a watercourse constructed to carry water from a source to a distribution point far away. In modern engineering, the term aqueduct is used for any system of pipes, ditches, canals, tunnels, and other structures used for this purpose. The term aqueduct also often refers specifically to a bridge carrying an artificial watercourse. Aqueducts were used in ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, and ancient Rome. In modern times, the largest aqueducts of all have been built in the United States to supply large cities. The simplest aqueducts are small ditches cut into the earth. Much larger channels may be used in modern aqueducts. Aqueducts sometimes run for some or all of their path through tunnels constructed underground. Modern aqueducts may also use pipelines. Historically, agricultural societies have constructed aqueducts to irrigate crops and supply large cities with drinking water. Etymology The word is derived from the Latin (water) and (led, guided). Ancient aqueducts Although particularly associated with the Romans, aqueducts were devised much earlier in Greece and the Near East and Indian subcontinent, where peoples such as the Egyptians and Harappans built sophisticated irrigation systems. Roman-style aqueducts were used as early as the 7th century BC, when the Assyrians built an 80 km long limestone aqueduct, which included a 10 m high section to cross a 300 m wide valley, to carry water to their capital city, Nineveh. =India= Ancient Indian aqueduct in Hampi The Indian subcontinent is believed to have some of the earliest aqueducts. Evidence can be found at the sites of present-day Hampi, Karnataka. The massive aqueducts near river Tungabhadra supplying irrigation water were once long. The waterways supplied water to royal bath tubs. =Oman= In Oman from the Iron Age, in Salut, Bat, and other sites, a system of underground aqueducts called falaj or qanƒÅts were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping horizontal tunnels. There are three types of falaj: *Daudi (ÿØÿßŸàŸàÿØŸäÿ©) with underground aqueducts *Ghaili (ÿßŸÑÿ∫ŸäŸÑŸäÿ© ) requiring a dam to collect the water *Aini (ÿßŸÑÿπŸäŸÜŸäÿ© ) whose source is a water spring These enabled large scale agriculture to flourish in a dry land environment. =Persia= Scheme of a qanat, an underground form of aqueduct popular in ancient Persia In Persia from early times a system of underground aqueducts called qanƒÅts were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping tunnels. This technique: *taps into subterranean water in a manner that delivers water to the surface without need for pumping. The water drains relying on gravity, with the destination lower than the source, which is typically an upland aquifer. *allows water to be transported long distances in hot dry climates without losing a large proportion of the source water to seepage and evaporation. =Petra, Jordan= Nabataean aqueduct in Petra, Jordan Throughout Petra, Jordan, the Nabataean engineers took advantage of every natural spring and every winter downpour to channel water where it was needed. They constructed aqueducts and piping systems that allowed water to flow across mountains, through gorges and into the temples, homes, and gardens of Petra's citizens. Walking through the Siq, one can easily spot the remains of channels that directed water to the city center, as well as durable retention dams that kept powerful flood waters at bay. =Greece= On the island of Samos, the Tunnel of Eupalinos was built during the reign of Polycrates (538-522 BC). It is considered an underground aqueduct and brought fresh water to Pythagoreion for roughly a thousand years. =Roman= The multiple arches of the Pont du Gard, in Roman Gaul. Its lower tiers carry a road across the river, and the upper tiers support an aqueduct conduit that carried water to Nimes Roman aqueducts were built in all parts of the Roman Empire, from Germany to Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where they totalled over . The aqueducts supplied fresh water to public baths and for drinking water, in large cities across the empire, and set a standard of engineering that was not surpassed for more than a thousand years. Bridges, built in stone with multiple arches, were a distinctive feature of Roman aqueducts and hence the term aqueduct is often applied specifically to a bridge for carrying water. =South America= Underground aqueducts of Cantalloc, Nazca, Peru Near the Peruvian town of Nazca, an ancient pre- Columbian system of aqueducts called Puquios were built and are still in use today. They were made of intricately placed stones, a construction material widely used by the Nazca culture. The time period in which they were constructed is still debated, but some evidence supports circa A.D. 540‚Äì552, in response to drought periods in the region. The Guayabo National Monument of Costa Rica, a park covering the largest archaeological site in the country, contains a system of aqueducts. The complex network of uncovered and covered aqueducts still functions well. The aqueducts are constructed from rounded river stones, which are mostly made of volcanic rock. The civilization that constructed the aqueduct system remains a mystery to archaeologists; it is suspected that Guayabo's aqueducts sat at a point of ancient cultural confluence between Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas. =North America= When Europeans saw the Aztec capital Tenochtitl√°n, early in the 16th century, the city was watered by two aqueducts. One of these, Chapultepec Aqueduct, built circa 1420, was rebuilt by the Spanish almost three hundred years later. Originally tracing part of its path over now-gone Lake Texcoco, only a fragment remains in Mexico City today. =Sri Lanka= Extensive usage of elaborate aqueducts have been found to have been used in ancient Sri Lanka. The best example is the Yoda Ela or Jaya Ganga, an long water canal carrying excess water between two artificial reservoirs with a gradient of 10 to 20 cm per kilometer during the fifth century AD. However, the ancient engineering methods in calculating the exact elevation between the two reservoirs and the exact gradient of the canal to such fine precision had been lost with the fall of the civilization in 13th Century.http://www.srilanka.travel/yoda-ela Modern aqueducts Modern aqueducts are a central part of many countries' water distribution infrastructure. The United States' aqueducts are some of the world's largest. The Catskill Aqueduct carries water to New York City over a distance of 120 miles (190 km), but is dwarfed by aqueducts in the far west of the country, most notably the 242-mile (389-km) Colorado River Aqueduct, which supplies the Los Angeles area with water from the Colorado River nearly 250 miles to the east and the California Aqueduct, which runs from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Lake Perris. The Central Arizona Project is the largest and most expensive aqueduct constructed in the United States. It stretches 336 miles from its source near Parker, Arizona to the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson. An aqueduct in New Zealand, \\"the Oamaru Borough Race\\", was constructed in the late 19th century to deliver water (and water-power) about 50 km from the Waitaki River at Kurow to the coastal town of Oamaru. In Spain, the Tagus-Segura Water Transfer system of aqueducts opened in 1979 and transports water from north to south. In China, the South‚ÄìNorth Water Transfer Project aims to connect the Yangtze River basin to Beijing through three separate systems. The project will reuse part of the Grand Canal of China. Design=Open channels= The simplest aqueducts are small ditches cut into the earth. Much larger channels may be used in modern aqueducts, for instance the Central Arizona Project uses wide channels. A major factor in the design of all open channels is its gradient. A higher gradient allows a smaller channel to carry the same amount of water as a larger channel with a lower gradient, but increases the potential of the water to damage the aqueduct's structure. A typical Roman aqueduct had a gradient of about 1:4800.Mays, L. (Editor), Ancient Water Technologies, Springer, 2010. p. 119 Artificial rills Freiburg, Germany. An artificial rill, part of the Falaj water transportation system, at Al Ain Oasis, in the Abu Dhabi Emirate.A constructed functional rill is a small canal or aqueduct of stone, brick, concrete, or other lining material, usually rectilinear in cross section, for water transportation from a source such as a river, spring, reservoir, qanat, or aqueduct for domestic consumption or agricultural irrigation of crop land uses. Rills were traditionally used in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climate cultures of ancient and historical eras; and other climates and continents worldwide. They are distinguished from a 'water ditch' by being lined to reduce absorption losses and to increase durability. The Falaj irrigation system at the Al Ain Oasis, in present-day Abu Dhabi Emirate, uses rills as part of its qanat water system. Sometimes in the Spanish language they are called Acequias. Rills are also used for aesthetic purposes in landscape design. Rills are used as narrow channels of water inset into the pavement of a garden, as linear water features, and often tiled and part of a fountain design. The historical origins are from paradise garden religious images that first translated into ancient Persian Gardens. Rills were later exceptionally developed in the Moorish (Spanish) Gardens of Al-andalus, such as at the Alhambra in Granada; and also in other Islamic gardens, cultures, and countries. Early 20th century examples are in the Maria Louisa Park gardens in Seville, Spain; and at the Casa del Herrero gardens in Montecito, California. =Tunnels= Aqueducts sometimes run for some or all of their path through tunnels constructed underground. A version of this common in North Africa and Central Asia that has vertical wells at regular intervals is called a qanat. One historic example found in Syria, the Qanat Firaun, extends over 100 kilometers. =Pipes= The Los Angeles Aqueduct Modern aqueducts may also make extensive use of pipelines. Pipelines are useful for transporting water over long distances when it needs to move over hills, or where open channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation, freezing, pollution, or environmental impact. They can also be used to carry treated water. Uses Historically, agricultural societies have constructed aqueducts to irrigate crops. Archimedes invented the water screw to raise water for use in irrigation of croplands. Another use for aqueducts is to supply large cities with drinking water. It also help drought prone areas with water supply. Some of the Roman aqueducts still supply water to Rome today. In California, United States, three large aqueducts supply water over hundreds of miles to the Los Angeles area. Two are from the Owens River area, and a third is from the Colorado River. In modern civil engineering projects, detailed study and analysis of open-channel flow is commonly required to support flood control, irrigation systems, and large water supply systems when an aqueduct rather than a pipeline is the preferred solution. In the past, aqueducts often had channels made of earth or other porous materials but significant amounts of water are lost through such unlined aqueducts. As water gets increasingly scarce, these canals are being lined with concrete, polymers, or impermeable soil. In some cases, a new aqueduct is built alongside the old one because it cannot be shut down during construction.

It is one of France's top tourist attractions and a World Heritage Site. Aqueduct of Vanvitelli, Italy, built by Luigi Vanvitelli. It is a World Heritage Site and one of the finest examples of an aqueduct in Europe. Aqueducts or water bridges are bridges constructed to convey watercourses across gaps such as valleys or ravines. The term aqueduct may also be used to refer to the entire watercourse, as well as the bridge.\\"aqueduct\\", Britannica CD 2000 Large navigable aqueducts are used as transport links for boats or ships.

A modern version of an aqueduct is a pipeline bridge. They may take the form of tunnels, networks of surface channels and canals, covered clay pipes or monumental bridges. Ancient bridges for water Mathur Aqueduct, India Although particularly associated with the Romans, aqueducts were likely first used by the Minoans around 2000 BCE. The Minoans had developed what was then an extremely advanced irrigation system, including several aqueducts.Minoan Aqueducts: A Pioneering Technology, ancient.eu In the seventh century BCE, the Assyrians built an 80 km long limestone aqueduct, which included a 10 m high section to cross a 300 m wide valley, to carry water to their capital city, Nineveh.Thorkild Jacobsen and Seton Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Oriental Institute Publication 24, University of Chicago Press, 1935] =Roman Empire= Bridges were a distinctive feature of Roman aqueducts, which were built in all parts of the Roman Empire, from Germany to Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where they supplied water to public baths and for drinking. Roman aqueducts set a standard of engineering that was not surpassed for more than a thousand years. Ancient Indian aqueduct in Hampi Modern aqueducts=Navigable aqueducts= Navigable aqueducts, also called water bridges, are water-filled bridges to allow vessels on a waterway to cross ravines or valleys. During the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, navigable aqueducts were constructed as part of the boom in canal-building. A notable revolving aqueduct has been made on the Bridgewater Canal. This allowed vessels to cross at high and low levels while conserving water that would be lost in the operation of locks.

Hawad deploys a method he calls furigraphy (a play on the word calligraphy) to create space in his poetry and to illuminate certain themes. Common themes of his work include thirst, movement, wandering, anarchy, and political themes related to Tuareg politics in the region. He is married to H√©l√®ne Claudot-Hawad, a Tuareg scholar and translator of Hawad's poetry into French. He has published a number of poems, epics, and other literary works primarily in French, but translations have increased in recent years with an Arabic translation of Testament nomade by prominent Syrian poet Adunis. Life and work Hawad was born in 1950 in the A√Ør region in what is today Niger. Although born in what is now Niger, Hawad refuses to identify with this state. He was born into a family of the Ikazkazan Tuareg, who are part of the larger Kel Ayr Tuareg group. He recounts many crossings over the Sahara and the Sahel on camel back while he was growing up with his brothers and father. In his early adult life, he was part of a growing number of Tuareg who moved away from Tuareg lands to work as a day laborer with stretches of unemployment which first introduced him to Tuareg politics. He married H√©l√®ne Claudot-Hawad and relocated, in \\"chosen exile\\", to France before the Tuareg revolutions in the early 1990s. =Literary works= Hawad has published a number of literary works from the mid-1980s to the present. Many of these are books of poetry, but others also combine literary forms similar to mythical epics, lyrical prose, and novels. At the same time, he writes polemical, political essays in many of the prominent newspapers in France and Niger. To compose his poetry, he delivers the poems aloud in his native tongue of Tamazight and records the presentation before he and his wife translate the poems into French for publication. This process is aimed to capture the transition in literature from oral recitations of the nomadic lifestyle into the individualized ideas of modern authorship. Themes common in his early work were issues related to life in the desert: primarily thirst, hunger, and constantly moving. While retaining these themes, his later work began to directly engage with the politics of Tuareg nationalism and oppression by the governments of Mali and Niger. Chaos and wandering are also themes which run throughout his work and he uses these themes to connect Tuareg nomad life with other struggles around the world. Although he identifies with the Tuareg people, his poetry and politics embrace anarchy and are focused primarily on resistance to oppressive forces. Christopher Wise writes that \\"his poetry, like his politics, militates against political affiliations of any sort, with the possible exception of Western anarchist traditions as well as military movements like the Zapatistas in Mexico.\\" The politics of his poems are interpreted as a response to attempts in the French media to make the Tuareg exotic or efforts to make the area a site for tourism. =Furigraphy= A unique component of the written poems is the inclusion of altered Tifinagh, the written form of Tamazight, characters in a form of calligraphy. Although the characters are rooted in Tifinagh writing, Hawad changes them to remove any specific meaning and simply to create space within the poems. He calls this practice furigraphy (furigraphie in French). His experiments with furigraphy in his poetry led Hawad to produce a number of art works building from the altered characters. Hawad's furigraphy locates him within a wider movement to maintain and protect Tifinagh characters in the Tuareg diaspora communities. List of works The following is a list of works produced by Hawad (all were first published in French). *Caravane de la soif et de l'√©garement (1987) *Chants de la soif et de l'√©garement (1987) *Testament nomade (1987)- translated into Arabic by Syrian poet Adunis *L'Anneau-Sentier (1989) *Froissevent (1991) *Yasida (1991) *La danse fun√®bre du soleil (1992) *Buveurs de braises (1992) *Sept fi√®vres et une lune (1995) *Le coude gri√ßant de l'anarchie (1998) *Les haleurs d'horizon (1998) *Notre horizon de gamelles pour une gamelle d‚Äôhorizons (2001) *D√©tournement d'horizon (2002) *Sahara.

The Bradley Foundation of Columbus, Georgia, acquired the property from Bradshaw's estate and in 1949 presented it to the University of Georgia as a home for its president. With the help of donations from the Bradley Foundation, the Georgia Board of Regents acquired the property in the early 1940s. The University of Georgia restored the house and grounds; Cooper, Bond, and Cooper were the architects in charge of remodeling, and Hubert B. Owens, A.S.L.A., designed the rear gardens. The front yard was refurbished in 1965. The house is one of the oldest buildings in Athens, Georgia.

Today it may be extirpated from the state of Florida.USFWS Species Assessment and Listing Priority Assignment Form. United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Georgia aster is a robust rhizomatous perennial herb producing colonies of woody stems up to long. The thick, dark green leaves are up to long by wide. They are oblong to lance-shaped with smooth or serrated margins. The flower heads are borne on rough-haired, glandular peduncles. The bracts are linear to lance-shaped. The flower heads are relatively large, up to 5 to 6 centimeters across. Each ray floret is up to 2 centimeters long. The florets are purple and have been described as \\"dark purple\\" to \\"lavender violet to dark reddish purple\\". The disc florets at the center are white and purplish. This plant blooms in October and November. The Georgia aster grows in oak-pine woodlands. The local region was once covered in a post oak-savanna, and this species was a member of this ecosystem. This type of plant community depends on natural disturbance, such as wildfire. Today this type of plant community has been largely destroyed or degraded by fire suppression and the removal of certain large grazing mammals. The Georgia aster is therefore a relict species of this historic ecosystem, and grows in remaining woodlands. 146 populations are estimated to remain. Threats to the survival of the species include elimination of habitat disturbance such as fire. Other threats include road construction and herbicide application.

In addition to its core research agenda, the Centre runs several key projects and has a number of formalised partnerships with academic and research institutions in Papua New Guinea. = Papua New Guinea Budget Project = Together with PNG's National Research Institute, the Development Policy Centre completed the Promoting Effective Public Expenditure Project (PEPE) to better understand how PNG allocates its public funds, and how funds are provided to and used by those responsible for delivering basic services. In 2012, 360 primary and health care clinics across eight provinces were surveyed. Many of these facilities has also been prior surveyed in 2002. In 2014, the final report of the project was published . It found that PNG‚Äôs primary schools have rapidly expanded over the last decade, however there were fewer services provided by health clinics. = Partnership with PNG‚Äôs National Research Institute = Following the success of the PEPE project, the Centre has renewed its partnership with the PNG‚Äôs National Research Institute. Together, they are continuing collaborative research on public resource management, fiscal and macroeconomic policies, and effective service delivery in Papua New Guinea. = Partnership with the University of Papua New Guinea = Devpolicy has had a strong and deepening relationship with the University of Papua New Guinea, in particular the School of Business and Public Policy. This partnership includes the co-hosting of the annual PNG Update conference, and initiatives to strengthen research and teaching of economics and public policy at UPNG, such as academic placements and exchanges. = Femili PNG ‚Äì The Lae Case Management Centre = The Development Policy Centre provides pro-bono institutional support to Femili PNG, a local NGO based in Lae, Papua New Guinea, that runs a Case Management Centre. Femili PNG‚Äôs Case Management Centre works to assist survivors of family and sexual violence to access the services they need. It began operations in mid-2014. = Australian and New Zealand Aid Stakeholder Surveys = In 2013, the Centre launched the Australian aid stakeholder survey, and repeated the survey in 2015, expanding it to cover New Zealand. The survey is designed to obtain feedback on the effectiveness of the Australian and New Zealand aid programs, and provide suggestions for their improvement. A full report of the 2013 survey and the 2015 survey results was published, and it identified several areas where the Australian aid program could make improvements. = Greg Taylor scholars = The Centre offers fellowships named after Greg Taylor AO (former Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund for both Australia and Papua New Guinea, and secretary of various Australian Government Departments) for research on economic development related to PNG or the Pacific a period of two to three months. The Development Policy Centre invites applications from students already studying at The Australian National University or elsewhere in Australia, and from emerging economics scholars in the Pacific and PNG. = Other research = Other key areas of work for the centre include infrastructure maintenance and funding in PNG and the Pacific, Australian aid and public opinion, analysis of the Papua New Guinean economy, corruption perceptions in Papua New Guinea, and work on global issues such as a climate change and development financing. Funding In November 2012, the Centre attracted a philanthropic donation from the Harold Mitchell Foundation,Harold Mitchell Foundation .

The 11 known mass graves in Celje itself and 14 in the immediate vicinity include some of the largest mass graves in Slovenia.Plut- Pregelj, Leopoldina, & Carole Rogel. 2010. The A to Z of Slovenia. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, p. 283. Background After the end of the war, the remaining German-speaking portion of Celje was expelled. The new communist government took advantage of existing anti-tank trenches, dug around Celje by the retreating German army, by using them as mass graves. They were filled with Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian militia members that had collaborated with the Germans, as well as civilians that had opposed either the national liberation movement or the communist revolution during the war, civilians of German descent, or simply individuals accused or suspected of anti-communism. The purpose was to physically eliminate any potential political opposition, on the pretext of collaboration with the enemy. The Yugoslav National Army executed more than 80,000‚Äîmostly Croat, German, and Slovene‚Äîprisoners in the Celje area, without any judicial process. The bodies were buried in hidden mass graves in Celje; the exact number is still not known. At the nearby concentration camp at Teharje, some 5,000 Slovenians, hundreds of them minors, were murdered within two months after the end of the war, again without trial. Furthermore, refugee trains carrying German civilians from the Rann triangle area were halted near Celje on 5 August 1945 and their passengers sent to a concentration camp at Teharje. After the camp was closed in 1950, the local authorities established a large industrial dump over the graveyard there, concealing the evidence of killings under a mound of toxic waste. In the mid-1970s, 30 years after crimes, the local authorities built preschools, schools, apartment blocks, halls and other structures on top of the mass graves. In 1991, when it became possible again to discuss the facts pertaining to the massacre, the Slovenian government decided to build a memorial to the victims of Teharje. List of mass graves Eleven mass graves are located in the city of Celje itself: *The Selce 1 Mass Grave (), also known as the Selce Electrical Substation Mass Grave (), is located on at the eastern edge of the electrical substation in the Selce neighborhood. It contains the remains of 50 to 100 victims murdered in an Informbiro purge in January 1948. *The Selce 2 Mass Grave () is located between the second and third poles on the power line from the Selce electrical substation. It contains the remains of victims murdered in the nearby forest in 1946 and 1947. *The City Cemetery 1 Mass Grave () is located in a grassy area in the southern part of the city cemetery. It contains the remains of six unknown victims discovered during excavation work for the Slovenijales factory in the Medlog neighborhood. *The City Cemetery 2 Mass Grave () is located at the northeast edge of the city cemetery, behind the cross by the cemetery wall. It contains the remains of victims disinterred from the city park and the city itself and reburied in 1945. *The City Cemetery 3 Mass Grave () is located in the city cemetery, above the path leading from the retaining wall near the First World War graves of German soldiers to the southwest edge of the section. It contains the remains of victims disinterred from the city park and the city itself and reburied in 1945. *The Blessed Spring Mass Grave () is located in the Selce neighborhood. It contains the remains of victims shot and buried here in 1946 and 1947. *The Zgornja Hudinja Mass Grave () is located in a former anti-tank trench in a meadow east of Fran Ro≈° Primary School in the Zgornja Hudinja neighborhood. Field excavations in September 1997 indicated that it contains the remains of at least 37 men and three women, a mix of Usta≈°a soldiers and civilians. *The Klukec Mass Grave () is located in Spodnja Hudinja neighborhood of the city, on the east side of a building. The remains of multiple unknown victims were found here during excavation work on 20 August 1996 and were disinterred three days later. *The Sunny Park Mass Grave () is located below and east of an embankment in the north-central part of the city. It contains the remains of 50 to 100 German prisoners of war that died of disease in July and August 1956 in the nearby Lazaret building. *The Tuma Street Mass Grave () is located on the northern edge of Celje in the Lahov≈°ek Woods along Tuma Street (). It contains the remains of four German prisoners of war and two local men murdered in June 1945. *The Babno 19B Grave () is located on the northwest edge of a field at the farm at Babno 19B, about 15 m from the Su≈°nica Canal. It contains the body of a Croat soldier that fled from the Lipovski Travnik prison camp. Locals found the body in June 1945 and buried it at the site.

Co-citation Proximity Analysis or CPA is a document similarity measure that uses citation analysis to assess semantic similarity between documents at both the global document level as well as at individual section-level.Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 \\"Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) ‚Äì A new approach for identifying related work based on Co- Citation Analysis\\" in Birger Larsen and Jacqueline Leta, editors, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI‚Äô09), volume 2, pages 571‚Äì575, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), July 2009.Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel. \\"Method and system for detecting a similarity of documents\\". Patent Application, Oct 27, 2011. 2011/0264672 A1. The similarity measure builds on the co-citation analysis approach, but differs in that it exploits the information implied in the placement of citations within the full-texts of documents. Co-citation Proximity Analysis was conceived by B. Gipp in 2006Bela Gipp, 2006. \\"Doctoral Proposal: (Co-)Citation Proximity Analysis ‚Äì A Measure to Identify Related Work\\" and the description of the document similarity measure was later published by Gipp and Beel in 2009. The similarity measure rests on the assumption that within a document‚Äôs full-text, the documents cited in close proximity to each other tend to be more strongly related than those documents cited farther apart. The figure to the right illustrates the concept. The CPA approach to document similarity assumes the documents B and C to be more strongly related than the documents B and A, because the citations to B and C occur within the same sentence, whereas the citations to B and A are separated by several paragraphs. The advantage of the CPA approach compared to other citation and co-citation analysis approaches is an improvement in precision. Other widely used citation analysis approaches, such as Bibliographic Coupling, Co-Citation or the Amsler measure, do not take into account the location or proximity of citations within documents. The CPA approach allows a more granular automatic classification of documents and can also be used to identify not only related documents, but the specific sections within texts that are most related. Method of calculation The CPA similarity measure calculates a Citation Proximity Index (CPI) for each set of documents cited by an examined document. Cited documents are assigned a weight of \\\\frac{1}{2^n}, where n stands for the number of levels between citations. Beginning at the lowest level, levels may be defined as citation groups, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and finally the entire document or even journal. There are several variations of the CPA algorithm. *Basic-CPA ‚Äì fundamental concept of CPA as described above *Extended-CPA ‚Äì considers the tree structure and order of citations within citation groups *Multidimensional-CPA ‚Äì uses additional information such as the impact factor *Hybrid-CPA ‚Äì combines the CPI with other similarity measures, for example text-based measures. This boosts performance especially for documents with insufficient citation information. Performance The CPA similarity measure builds upon the co-citation document similarity approach with the distinctive addition of proximity analysis. Therefore, the CPA approach allows for the calculation of a more granular resolution of overall document similarity. CPA has been found to outperform co-citation analysis, especially when documents contain extensive bibliographies and in cases where documents have not been frequently cited together (i.e. have a low co-citation score).M. Schwarzer, M. Schubotz, N. Meuschke, C. Breitinger, V. Markl, and B. Gipp, \\"Evaluating Link- based Recommendations for Wikipedia\\" in Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), New York, NY, USA, 2016, pp. 191-200. Liu and Chen found that sentence-level co-citations are potentially more efficient markers for use in co-citation analysis in comparison to the loosely coupled article-level only co-citations, since sentence-level co- citations tend to preserve the essential structure of the traditional co- citation network and also form a much smaller subset of all co-citation instances.Shengbo Liu and Chaomei Chen, 2001 \\"The Effects of Co-citation Proximity on Co-citation Analysis\\", The 13th Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI), July 4‚Äì7, 2011 Durban, South Africa. An analysis by Schwarzer et al. showed that the citation-based measures CPA and co-citation analysis, have complementary strengths compared to text-based similarity measures. Text-based similarity approaches reliably identified more narrowly similar articles out of a test collection of Wikipedia articles, e.g. articles sharing identical terms, while the CPA approach outperformed CoCit at identifying more broadly related articles, as well as more popular articles, which the authors claim to likely also be of higher quality.

Intertidal Invertebrates of California. pp. 119. Stanford University Press. . Description Astropecten armatus is a dorsally flattened starfish, which grows to a diameter of about . The disc is quite small and the five arms are slender and pointed, slightly turned up at the tips. The madreporite is very close to the edge of the disc. The central surface of both disc and arms is smooth. The arms have conspicuous marginal plates with a fringe of upward pointing spines and another of downward pointing ones. Further rows of spines line the ambulacral grooves. The tube feet are pointed and do not have suckers. The colour of the aboral (upper) surface is yellowish brown, dull pink or grey and the starfish blends in well with the colour of the substrate. The oral (under) surface is pale yellow or ivory. Distribution and habitat Astropecten armatus is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean on sandy or soft gravel seabeds, often semi-submerged in the sediment. Its range extends from San Pedro Bay in California (USA) to Ecuador. Off the western coast of Mexico, it is the most abundant starfish on suitable substrates, at all depths between . Biology Astropecten armatus is an agile starfish. It can \\"glide\\" across the surface of the sand with its mobile tube feet. If turned upside down it can right itself with a flip and if several are stacked on top of each other, they will quickly disperse. It is a predator and primarily feeds on the olive snail (Olivella biplicata). It can consume these at the rate of one each day but, when they are less plentiful, it will turn to other food sources and eat sand dollars and sea pansies (Renilla reniformis) and scavenge on dead fish.

Jean-Baptiste Andr√© Guillot (9 December 1827 ‚Äì 6 September 1893) was a nurseryman and rose hybridizer in Lyon, France, son of nurseryman and rose hybridizer Jean-Baptiste Guillot (10 December 1803 ‚Äì 18 April 1882). Jean-Baptiste the son is known as Guillot Fils, and Jean-Baptiste the elder as Guillot P√®re. Guillot Fils is best known as the creator of the rose 'La France', considered to be the first hybrid tea rose, introduced in 1867. Biography Jean-Baptiste Guillot (P√®re) opened a rose nursery in the La Guilloti√®re area of Lyon in 1829, and Jean-Baptiste Andr√© (Fils) grew up working in the nursery from the age of 14. Guillot P√®re was the first nurseryman in Lyon to concentrate on the propagation of roses, produced new hybrids himself, and propagated and introduced new hybrids created by others, primarily Hybrid Perpetuals and Teas. Guillot Fils, while working for his father, pioneered the propagation of rose rootstocks from seed rather than cuttings. The roses used for rootstocks at that time were the wild species Rosa canina, the dog rose, and Rosa rubiginosa, the sweetbriar or eglantine. In 1850, Guillot Fils married Catherine Berton. He started his own nursery in 1852, in the Montplaisir district of Lyon. Their son Pierre Guillot was born on November 13, 1855. Pierre began working in the family business in 1884, under the name Guillot and Son. Pierre took over management in 1892. Guillot Fils was an Honorary Member of the (Royal) National Rose Society in London. One of his roses had been chosen by the Society of Horticulture of Lyon as being worthy of the name 'La France'. Guillot Fils died in 1893, leaving Pierre in charge of a thriving business with an international reputation. Contributions Guillot Fils revolutionized the production of rose rootstocks through the use of seed propagation, rather than rooting cuttings. He created two new classes of roses, the hybrid tea and the polyantha. He created the first Tea rose with anything like a true yellow color, 'Mme. Hoste', which was later used as the pollen parent for the still-popular yellow tea rose 'Lady Hillingdon'. His pink Tea rose 'Catherine Mermet' was a popular florist rose in the late 19th century. His nursery is still in operation in the 21st century, and still hybridizes new rose varieties. Partial List of Guillot P√®re and Fils Cultivars Rosa 'La France' *'Mme. Brevy' (1848) *'Mme.

Football career Bedingfield was born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear and represented South Shields Schools before moving to Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. After a spell with Rushden he joined Aston Villa in June 1898. His only first-team appearance for Villa came on 26 November 1898 at Sheffield Wednesday. Bedingfield scored the equalizer for Villa a minute after Tommy Crawshaw had given Wednesday the lead on 20 minutes. After two goals from Willie Dryburgh, Wednesday were 3‚Äì1 up when the referee Arthur Scragg called a halt on 79 minutes because of the failing light. The Football League ruled that the match had to be finished so the remaining eleven minutes of the match were played on 13 March 1899, when Bedingfield was replaced by Billy Garraty. Despite Villa's best efforts, they were unable to score but instead Fred Richards managed to scramble another goal for Wednesday in the final minute. Although Wednesday won this match, they were relegated at the end of the season while Villa were champions. Bedingfield left Villa in August 1899 to join Queens Park Rangers of the Southern League. In his one year at Kensal Rise, Bedingfield was the club's top scorer with 21 goals in all competitions. His goals included one against Wolverhampton Wanderers of the First Division in the FA Cup First Round replay. The goal came in extra time after a goalless 90 minutes, when he burst past the Wolves back line two minutes into the second period to slam the ball home past Tom Baddeley in the Wolves' goal. In the Second Round, Q.P.R. met fellow Southern League club Millwall Athletic and lost 2‚Äì0. Bedingfield moved to Portsmouth, another Southern League club, in the summer of 1900, where he was to remain for two years before dropping out of professional football.

From 1986 to 1990, he was Head of the Tourism and Sport Division, Commonwealth Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Tourism. From 1990 to 2000, he was Executive Director of the Australian Sports Commission (ASC). Sport Whilst working in the Australian Government Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, he played a role in the establishment of the new Australian Sports Commission as the government authority responsible for all sports development in Australia. He became Executive Director of the Australian Sports Commission in 1990 replacing Ron Harvey. He took over the ASC at a time when it had just completed the merger between the ASC and the Australian Institute of Sport and the Senate Inquiry into Drugs in Sport. In 1993, Australia won the right to host the 2000 Sydney Olympics and Paralympics. This resulted in the Australian Government announcing the Olympic Athlete Program (OAP) in 1994.

Even the name of the hill where it is situated also says the same thing, \\"Deuduar\\" means \\"Gate of God\\". Proper excavation of the temple & cave may still reveal many more secret in future.

Voters selected candidates for all local positions: a town mayor, vice mayor and town councilors, as well as members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, a vice-governor, a governor and a representative for the lone district of Marinduque in the House of Representatives. In this election, a number of provincial-level officials sought reelection, including incumbent governor Carmencita Reyes and incumbent congressman Lord Allan Jay Velasco. Background=Congressional election= Incumbent congressman Lord Allan Jay Velasco, who was first elected in the 2010 election, is running for a second term. Although he ran under the Lakas‚ÄìCMD ticket in 2010, for this election he is running under the National Unity Party (NUP). His challenger is Regina Ongsiako Reyes, the daughter of incumbent governor Carmencita Reyes, running under the Liberal Party. However, Reyes was ordered disqualified by the First Division of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) over her citizenship status. In its ruling, the Comelec cited the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003, claiming that Reyes was still an American citizen and she had failed to renounce her citizenship. In addition, the ruling notes that Reyes did not submit sufficient evidence that she had been resident in Marinduque for at least one year, citing documents which point to her term as Provincial Administrator. The ruling was affirmed by the Comelec en banc on May 14, 2013. But Commission on Election Chairman Sixto Brillantes in his dissenting opinion pointed that the evidence presented by Velasco's camp is a double hearsay and inadmissible since it was never sworn nor authenticated by the issuing officer and it was taken in an internet blog of unknown blogger. Despite this, Reyes continued to sit as representative of Marinduque, with the Reyes camp claiming that it is the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), and not the Comelec or the Supreme Court, that should have jurisdiction over the case. On September 11, 2014, Gabriela Representative Luzviminda Ilagan said that the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal voting 4-3 finally decided that they (HRET members) will uphold the exclusivity of jurisdiction over any protest or contest in the result of election of any House of Representatives members. With this development, the Commission's and the Supreme Court's respective decisions will be no longer in effect. Thus, Representative Regina Ongsiako Reyes was the seating Congresswoman of the Lone District of Marinduque but did not finish her 3-year term as she was later removed from her post and replaced by Velasco in February 2016. =Gubernatorial election= Incumbent governor Carmencita Reyes is running for a second term, having assumed the governorship after defeating then-incumbent Jose Antonio Carrion in the 2010 election, alongside her running mate, vice governor Antonio Uy Jr. Although she was a guest candidate of the Liberal Party the previous election, having run as a member of the party-list group Bigkis Pinoy, for this election she is running as the Liberal Party candidate. Reyes' running mate is doctor Romulo Bacorro. Uy has since left the Liberal Party and has decided to run for governor under the NUP, the party of Congressman Velasco. However, he does not have a running mate; instead, the NUP is endorsing Melecio Go of the Nacionalista Party for the position of vice governor. Go is currently a member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for the province's first district, and was elected in 2010 as an independent. Carrion was seeking to retake his seat after losing the previous election to Reyes. Though he ran under the Lakas‚ÄìCMD ticket in 2010, for this election he is running under the banner of the Nationalist People's Coalition. His running mate is Jose Alvarez, who previously sat as a member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for the province's first district. Results=Provincial elections= Parties are as stated in their certificate of candidacies. Gubernatorial election Carmencita Reyes is the incumbent.

Despite being disqualified by the Comelec en banc, Regina Ongsiako Reyes was proclaimed anyway by the Provincial Board of Canvassers on May 15, 2013, although the camp of Lord Allan Jay Velasco attempted to stop the proclamation. Edwin Villa, the provincial election supervisor and head of Marinduque's Provincial Board of Canvassers, has since been replaced by Val Mendoza, the provincial election supervisor of Romblon, although it is unclear whether Mendoza assumed the position.

The first attempt was launched in 1628, and the second in 1629; both were unsuccessful. Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, managed to repel the sieges and beat off all of Sultan Agung's attacks. Prelude In the Indonesian Archipelago the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) first established their base of operation in Amboina. To expand their trading network, the Dutch asked for the permission of the Sultanate of Mataram, then the rising power in Java, to build lojis (trading posts, most consisting of a fort and warehouses) along Java's northern coast. The second ruler of Mataram, Raden Mas Jolang, allowed one such settlement to be built in Jepara in 1613, perhaps in hope that the company will be a powerful ally against his most powerful enemy, the city state of Surabaya. After the VOC under their most renowned governor general Jan Pieterszoon Coen had wrested the port of Jacatra (Jayakarta) from Sultanate of Banten in 1619, they established a town that would serve as the Company's headquarter in Asia for the next three centuries. As part of the Company's security policy the Javanese people were made to feel unwelcome in Batavia, as the Dutch feared an uprising should they formed the majority of the city's population. To meet labor needs, Batavia instead imported large numbers of workers and slaves from other parts of the archipelago, such as the Maluku Islands and Bali. Notable among these attempts were Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe voyage to bring 1,000 Chinese immigrants to Batavia from Macao; however, only a small fraction of the 1,000 survived the trip. In 1621, another attempt was initiated and 15,000 people were deported from the Banda Islands to Batavia; on this occasion, only 600 survived the trip. Having been established for almost a decade, Batavia, the first major Dutch settlement and trading post in Java, had naturally begun to draw hostility from the surrounding Javanese kingdoms. The European port and settlement was considered to be a foreign threat by the native polities. The sultans of Banten aspired to retake the port city and also to close down a major trading rival. However they could not afford to launch a campaign of a scale capable of retaking the port. Instead the Bantenese could only launch occasional small scale raids on Dutch interests outside of the city walls. Meanwhile, in the east, Mas Jolang died in 1613 and was succeeded by his son Sultan Agung, who was to become the greatest of Mataram's rulers. Relationship with the Company became more tense, with Agung early in his reign (1614) specifically warning a Dutch embassy that peace with him would be impossible to maintain if they were to try to conquer any part of Java, over which he was determined to become sole ruler. In 1618 a misunderstanding resulted in the VOC's loji in Jepara being burnt by Agung's regent, with three VOC personnel being killed and the rest arrested; this in turn caused a reprisal by the Dutch fleet in the same year and the year after that destroyed most of the city. Nevertheless, relationship between the two parties remained mixed; like his father Agung desired the company's naval assistance against Surabaya and in 1621 he made overtures of peace, which the Company reciprocated with embassies in the three following years. The Dutch, however, declined his request for military support. With the fall of Surabaya to his forces in 1625, Agung saw no further need to tolerate the foreign presence in what he saw as his rightful domain. First siege (22 August-3 December 1628) The map of Batavia circa 1627. On the left facing north is Batavia Castle. Agung might have started his plans for the conquest of Batavia as early as 1626. Aside of his aversion of the Dutch, it was a natural stepping stone for the conquest of Banten, the last major independent Javanese state. As preparation for this he made an alliance with Cirebon although in practice she was treated as a vassal of Mataram. In April 1628 Kyai Rangga Tapa, the regent of Tegal was sent to Batavia to propose a peace treaty with certain conditions on Mataram's behalf. The Dutch however, declined this proposal as well. For Agung, this was the last straw and he put his plan of attacking Batavia into motion. He sent two forces, one by sea under Tumenggung Bahureksa, the regent of Kendal, and another overland under Prince Mandudareja. malangbangs, at the 1628 siege of Batavia. Compare the size with the moored East Indiaman. On August 25, 1628, the vanguard of Agung's navy arrived in Batavia. The Mataram naval armada brought extensive amount of supplies, including 150 cattle, 5,900 sacks of sugar, 26,600 coconuts and 12,000 sacks of rice. As a ruse de guerre they initially asked for permission to land in Batavia to trade, however the size of the Mataram fleet caused the Dutch to be suspicious. The next day the Dutch allowed the cattle to be delivered, with the condition that only one Mataram ship at a time may dock. One hundred armed guards watched the landing from Batavia Castle. On the third day three more Mataram ships arrived, claiming that they were there to ask for a travel permit to trade with Malacca. The Hoge Regering became increasingly alarmed at the sudden increase in Mataram ship arrivals, and moved more artillery pieces to Batavia Castle's two northern bastions. Finally in the afternoon twenty more Mataram ships arrived and began to openly unload their troops north of the castle, causing the alerted Dutch to pull all personnel back into the castle and open fire on the incoming Javanese. To deny shelter for the invading army, Coen had most of Batavia's bamboo shack suburbs burnt. On August 28, 1628, 27 more Mataram ships entered the bay but landed quite far from Batavia. On the south of Batavia the vanguard of the overland Mataram force began to arrive, with 1,000 men starting to apply pressure upon Batavia's southern flank. On August 29 the first of many Mataram attacks was launched against Fort Hollandia, located southeast of the city. One hundred twenty VOC troops under the command of Jacob van der Plaetten managed to repulse the attack and the Javanese suffered heavy losses. Several company ships also arrived from Banten and Onrust island, landing an additional 200 troops and increasing Batavia's garrison to 730 men. The main part of the overland Mataram army arrived in October, bringing their total troop strength to 10,000 men. They blockaded all the roads running south and west of the city and tried to dam the Ciliwung river to limit the Dutch's water supply. This was of little use though, as repeated Mataram escalade attacks against the Dutch fortification resulted in nothing but heavy losses. Even worse, the Mataram commanders had not prepared for a long siege in an area devoid of local logistical support, and by December the army was already running out of supplies. Angered by the lack of success, on December 2 Sultan Agung sent his executioners to punish Tumenggung Bahureksa and Prince Mandurareja. The next day, the Dutch discovered that their opponent had marched home, leaving behind 744 headless corpses of their men. Second Siege (May‚ÄìSeptember 1629) The Siege of Batavia as part of Sultan Agung's campaign (1613-1645) After the debacle of the first siege, Agung realized that the main hurdle to the conquest of Batavia was logistical, due to the immense distance (some 300 miles) his forces had to cross from their supply bases in Central Java. He decided to establish numerous rice farming villages ran by Javanese farmers on the northern coast of Western Java, from Cirebon to Karawang. This sparked the first wave of Javanese migrations to this previously sparsely populated area, resulting in the vast ricelands that characterized the area from Cirebon to Indramayu, Karawang, and Bekasi that still exist today. By May 1629, Mataram was ready to launch its second attack on Batavia. The second invasion again consisted of two forces; the Sundanese army of Dipati Ukur, the regent of Priangan, a vassal of Mataram, and the main Javanese army led by Adipati Juminah, altogether some 20,000 strong. The original plan called for Ukur to wait for the main army to rendezvous with him in Priangan and to depart together in June, however lack of supplies forced Ukur to start his advance upon Batavia immediately. When Juminah arrived in Priangan, he was angered at the apparent insult Ukur had done to him. The angered Mataram officials and troops created havoc in Priangan, pillaging and raping local women. Hearing the news from his wife, the angered Ukur promptly withdrew from the campaign, going as far as killing a number of Mataram officials attached to his force. From the example of Tumenggung Bahureksa and Prince Mandurareja, Dipati Ukur knew that Sultan Agung would not tolerate failure, much less betrayal, and hence he decided to rise in rebellion against Mataram instead. With lack of supplies and plagued with malaria and cholera that hit the region, the Mataram troops that arrived at Batavia were exhausted. Mataram troops established an encampment located south of Batavia in an area now known as Matraman (derived from \\"Mataraman\\"). The Mataram forces besieged Batavia and disrupted Batavia's water supply by polluting the Ciliwung River, causing a cholera plague in Batavia. During this second siege Jan Pieterszoon Coen suddenly died on 21 September 1629, most likely because of this cholera outbreak. With internal problems among their commanders, and plagued with illness and a lack of supply, Mataram forces were finally forced to retreat. Aftermath The Dipati Ukur withdrawal from the campaign and his rebellion weakened the Mataram hold on Priangan that created instability in West Java for several years. The Dutch however managed to firmly establish themselves in Java. The Batavia campaign failure had led Sultan Agung to shift his conquering ambitions to the east and attack Blitar, Panarukan and the Blambangan in Eastern Java, a vassal of the Balinese kingdom of Gelgel. Because of Sultan Agung's harsh discipline against failure, large numbers of Javanese troops refused to return home to Mataram. Many of them decided to marry local women and settle down in northern West Java villages. This created the rice farming villages on the Pantura (pantai utara: north coast) region of West Java, spanning Bekasi, Karawang, Subang, Indramayu and Cirebon. The migration and settlement of the Javanese to Northern West Java created a distinctive culture, that later developed to be quite different from the highland Sundanese and Central Javanese counterparts. In the following decades, the VOC successfully expanded their influence by acquiring Buitenzorg and the Priangan highlands, and also Mataram's north coast ports such as Tegal, Kendal and Semarang through concessions in Mataram's expense. This was possible primarily due to internal problems within the Mataram court, plagued with succession disputes and struggle for power. Some of the former Mataram encampments became place names in Jakarta today, and can be identified by their originally Javanese names, such as Matraman, Paseban and Kampung Jawa.

Background  Genpei war Hana-wachigai) or (Shipp≈ç-ni-hanakaku), The Crest of the Izumo Genji clan Genpei war Sasaki Yoshikiyo was born as the 5th son of Sasaki Hideyoshi, who was the head of the Sasaki clan of Uda- Genji (Uda-Gen clan), based on Sasaki-no-sho, Gamo-gun Manor in ≈åmi Province. His father Hideyoshi Sasaki, who fought against the Taira clan in the H≈çgen (1156) and Heiji Wars (1160). As a result, Hideyoshi was defeated in the Heiji war. Hideyoshi was deprived of his feudal estate, and moved away to Sagami Province. Shibuya Shigekuni who was a samurai of Sagami had been respecting Hideyoshi's bravery. That is why he sheltered Hideyoshi in his territory and had his daughter marry Hideyoshi. Sasaki Yoshikiyo was born in Sagami in 1161 as the 5th son of Sasaki Hideyoshi. His mother was a daughter of Shibuya Shigekuni. Although Yoshikiyo had four elder brothers, they were by different mothers. Yoshikiyo grew up in Sagami, and married a daughter of ≈åba Kagechika.  Early military career  When Minamoto no Yoritomo (head of the Genji clan) raised an army for order to overthrow the Taira clan (Heike) in 1180, Yoshikiyo's step brothers sided with the Yoritomo. Shibuya Shigekuni who was Yoshikiyo's maternal grandfather sided with the Taira clan, and Oba Kagechika who was his father-in-law became the head of the Tairas' army. Shigekuni's longtime kindness made Hideyoshi unable to make up his mind. As the result, although he sided with the Tairas officially, he sided with Yoritomo in fact. His son Yoshikiyo also worried about the same problem, but he decided to side with the TAIRA clan finally. Yoshikiyo, who was on the Tairas' side, won the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which turned out to be the first fight of a series of wars. On the other hand, Yoritomo, who was on the Genji side, won the Battle of Kise-gawa, which broke out the next. Yoshikiyo surrendered to Yoritomo side, and after that, he sided with the Minamotos and fought in the Genpei War. In 1185, The Tairas were overthrown in Battle of Dan-no-ura. After the war ended, his four elder step brothers were praised about their distinguished military services by Yoritomo, and they got their own feudal estate. But since only Yoshikiyo had been on the enemy side at first, he just could not get any prizes. However, he kept on working seriously without blaming to this. In 1221, the J≈çky≈´ War broke out. He sided with Bakufu (Kamakura Shoguneto) and won a victory in this war. His distinguished military services and his old achievements were praised by Bakufu and he became the governor of both Oki Province and Izumo Province.  The end of his life  Since he became the governor of Oki and Izumo he emigrated to Izumo. In 1242, Yoshikiyo died at age 81.Since his posterity prospered at the place, the person in future generations called him \\"founder of Izumo Genji\\".

It combines restriction enzymes and bisulfite sequencing to enrich for areas of the genome with a high CpG content. Due to the high cost and depth of sequencing to analyze methylation status in the entire genome, Meissner et al. developed this technique in 2005 to reduce the amount of nucleotides required to sequence to 1% of the genome.Alexander Meissner, Andreas Gnirke, George W. Bell, Bernard Ramsahoye, Eric S. Lander and Rudolf Jaenisch. 2005. \\"Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing for comparative high-resolution DNA methylation analysis\\". Nucleic Acids Res. 33(18):5868-77 The fragments that comprise the reduced genome still include the majority of promoters, as well as regions such as repeated sequences that are difficult to profile using conventional bisulfite sequencing approaches.Gu H, Smith ZD, Bock C, Boyle P, Gnirke A, Meissner A. 2011. \\"Preparation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing libraries for genome-scale DNA methylation profiling.\\" Nat Protoc. 6(4):468-81. . An outline of the protocol for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing Overview of protocol #Enzyme digestion: First, genomic DNA is digested using a methylation- insensitive restriction enzyme. It is integral for the enzymes to not be influenced by the methylation status of the CpGs (sites within the genome where a cytosine is next to a guanine) as this allows for the digestion of both methylated and unmethylated areas. MspI is commonly used. This enzyme targets 5‚ÄôCCGG3‚Äô sequences and cleaves the phosphodiester bonds upstream of CpG dinucleotide. When using this particular enzyme, each fragment has a CpG at each end. This digestion results in DNA fragments of various sizes. # End repair and A-tailing: Due to the nature of how MspI cleaves double stranded DNA, this reaction results in strands with sticky ends. End repair is necessary to fill in the 3‚Äô terminal of the ends of the strands. The next step is adding an extra adenosine to both the plus and minus strands. This is referred to as A-Tailing and is necessary for adapter ligation in the subsequent step. End repair and A-Tailing is done within the same reactions, with dCTP, dGTP and dATP deoxyribonucleotides. To increase the efficiency of A tailing, the dATPs are added in excess in this reaction. # Sequence adapters: Methylated sequence adapters are ligated to the DNA fragments. The methylated adapter oligonucleotides have all cytosines replaced with 5‚Äômethyl-cytosines to prevent deamination of these cytosines in the bisulfite conversion reaction. To sequence reactions using Illumina sequencers, sequence adapters hybridize to the adapters on the flow cell. # Fragment purification: The desired size of fragments is selected for purification. Different sizes of the fragments are separated using gel electrophoresis and are purified using gel excising. According to Gu et al., DNA fragments of 40-220 base pair are representative of the majority of promoter sequences and CpG islands # Bisulfite conversion: The DNA fragments are then bisulfite converted, which is a process that deaminates unmethylated cytosine into a uracil. The methylated cytosines remain unchanged, due to the methyl group protecting them from the reaction. # PCR amplification: The bisulfite converted DNA is then amplified using PCR with primers that are complementary to the sequence adapters. # PCR purification: Before sequencing, the PCR product must be free of unused reaction reagents such as unincorporated dNTPs or salts. Thus, a step for PCR purification is required. This can be done by running another electrophoresis gel or by using kits designed specifically for PCR purification. # Sequencing: The fragments are then sequenced. When RRBS was first developed, Sanger sequencing was initially used. Now, next generation sequencing approaches are used. For Illumina sequencing, 36-base single-end sequencing reads are most commonly performed. # Sequence alignment and analysis: Due to the unique properties of RRBS, special software is needed for alignment and analysis.Chatterjee A, Rodger EJ, Stockwell PA, Weeks RJ, Morison IM. 2012. \\"Technical considerations for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing with multiplexed libraries.\\" J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012:741542. Using MspI to digest genomic DNA results in fragments that always start with a C (if the cytosine is methylated) or a T (if a cytosine was not methylated and was converted to a uracil in the bisulfite conversion reaction). This results in a non-random base pair composition. Additionally, the base composition is skewed due to the biased frequencies of C and T within the samples. Various software for alignment and analysis is available, such as Maq, BS Seeker, Bismark or BSMAP. Alignment to a reference genome allows the programs to identify base pairs within the genome that are methylated. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing Protocol Advantages=Enrichment of CpGs= RRBS uniquely uses a specific restriction enzyme to enrich for CpGs. MspI digestion, or any restriction enzyme that recognizes CpG's and cuts them, produces only fragments with CG‚Äôs at the end. This approach enriches for CpG regions of the genome, so it can decrease the amount of sequencing required as well as decrease the cost. This technique is cost-effective especially when focusing on common CpG regions. =Low sample input= Only a low sample concentration, between 10-300 ng, is required for accurate data analysis. This technique can be employed when there is a lack of precious sample. Another positive aspect is that fresh or live samples are not required. Formalin-fixed and paraffin- embedded inputs can also be used. Limitations=Restriction enzyme= In the specific protocol steps, there are also some limitations. MspI digestion covers the majority, but not all the CG regions in the genome. Some CpG‚Äôs are missed. Missing CpG‚Äôs can also occur since this protocol is only a representative sampling of the genome. Some regions thus have lower coverage. Other variations of this protocol use alternative enzymes. =PCR= During the PCR portion of the protocol, a non-proofreading polymerase must be used as a proof-reading enzyme would stop at uracil residues found in the ssDNA template. Using a polymerase that does not proof-read can also lead to increase PCR sequencing errors. =Bisulfite sequencing= Bisulfite sequencing only converts single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Complete bisulfite conversion requires thorough denaturation and absence of re-annealed double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Easy protocol steps have been shown to drive complete denaturation. Ensuring the usage of small fragments via shearing or digestion, fresh reagents, and sufficient denaturing time is crucial for complete denaturing Warnercke, P.M. Stirzaker, C., Song, J., Grunau, C., Melki, J.R., Clark, S.J. 2002. \\"Identification and resolution of artifacts in bisulphite sequencing.\\" Methods. 27: 101-107. Another suggested technique is to carry out the bisulfite reaction at 95 ¬∞C although DNA degradation also occurs at high temperatures. In the first hour of bisulfite reaction, it is predicted that less than 90% of the sample DNA is lost to degradation Grunau,C., Clark,S.J. and Rosenthal,A. 2001. \\"Bisulfite genomic sequencing: systematic investigation of critical experimental parameters.\\" Nucleic Acids Res., 29, E65‚Äì65. A balance between high temperature and low temperature is required to ensure complete denaturation and decreased DNA degradation. Usage of reagents, like urea, that prevent dsDNA from forming can also be employed. With contamination of dsDNA, it can be difficult to accurately computate the data. When an unconverted cytosine is observed, it is challenging to differentiate between lack of methylation and an artifact. Significance The significance of this technique is it allows for the sequencing of methylated areas that can't be properly profiled using conventional bisulfite sequencing techniques. Current sequencing technologies are limited in regards to profiling areas of repeated sequences.Bock C, Tomazou EM, Brinkman AB, M√ºller F, Simmer F, Gu H, J√§ger N, Gnirke A, Stunnenberg HG, Meissner A. 2010. \\"Quantitative comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation mapping technologies.\\" Nat Biotechnol. 28(10):1106-14. This is unfortunate in regards to methylation studies, as these repeated sequences often contain methylated cytosines. This is especially limiting for studies involving profiling cancer genomes, as a loss of methylation in this repeated sequences is observed in many cancer types.Ehrlich M. 2009. \\"DNA hypomethylation in cancer cells\\". Epigenomics. 1(2):239-59. . RRBS eliminates the problems encountered due to these large areas of repeated sequences and thus lets these regions be more fully annotated. Applications=Methylomes in cancer genomics= Aberrant methylation has been observed in cancer.Veersteeg, R. 1997. Aberrant methylation in cancer. American Journal of Human Genetics. 60:751-754. In cancer, hypermethylation as well as hypomethylation has been seen in tumors. Since RRBS is highly sensitive, this technique can be used to quickly look at aberrant methylation in cancer.Smith, Z.D., Gu, H., Bock, C., Gnike, A., & Meissner, A. 2009. High-throughput bisulfite sequencing in mammalian genomes. Methods. 48: 226-232. If samples from the patient's tumor and normal cells can be obtained, a comparison between these two cell types can be observed. A profile of the overall methylation can be produced quite rapidly. This technique can rapidly determine the overall methylation status of cancer genomes which is cost and time effective. =Methylation states in development= Stage-specific changes can be observed in all living organisms. Modifications in overall methylation levels via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing can be useful in developmental biology. Comparison with other techniques Results compared between RRBS and MethylC-seq are highly concordant with one another.Harris, Alan et al. 2010. ‚ÄúComparison of sequencing-based methods to profile DNA methylation and identification of monoallelic epigenetic modifications‚Äù Nature Biotechnology 28:1097-1105. Naturally, MethylC-seq has a greater genome-wide coverage of CpGs compared to RRBS, but RRBS has a greater coverage on CpG islands. One of the other most commonly used techniques for profling methylation is MeDiP-Seq. This technique is done by immunopreciptiation of methylated cytosines and subsequent sequencing. RRBS has a greater resolution compared to this technique, as MeDip-Seq is limited to 150 base pairs compared the one nucleotide resolution of RRBS. Bisulfite methods, such as used by RRBS, were also found more accurate than enrichment based, such as MeDip-Seq. The data obtained on RRBS and the Illumina Infinium methylation are highly comparable, with a Pearson correlation of 0.92. The data for both platforms are also directly comparable as both use an absolute measurement of DNA.

The indictment in Alabama was dismissed after it was determined the books did not violate state law. The publicity from Randall Terry's efforts was linked to an increase in sales of the books. In 2005 a man from Surrey, England was charged with being in possession of 19,000 images of children, including images from The Age of Innocence. The man stated in his defence that all of the images were sold by websites including W H Smith, Tesco, Waterstones and Amazon.com. Nevertheless his collection of images was ruled to be in the level 1 indecency category, though the ruling did not mention The Age of Innocence. Following the conviction W H Smith decided to stop selling The Age of Innocence from their website. A spokesman for Hamilton stated \\"We are deeply saddened and disappointed by this (...). We have known for some time that the law in Britain and the US‚Äîour two biggest markets‚Äîis becoming tighter each year. But the fact remains that the courts still have to decide on each case.\\" The Guardian originally reported that it was a \\"landmark ruling\\" against Hamilton's photographs. However, they later clarified that this was incorrect; there was no landmark ruling. Rather the defendant had pleaded guilty to specimen charges. A policeman in Surrey was forced to make a formal apology after he stated that anyone owning a book by Hamilton containing images of naked children could now be charged. A senior police officer later confirmed no official ruling on Hamilton's work had been made. In 2010 a man was convicted of level 1 child pornography for owning four books, including The Age of Innocence as well as Still Time by Sally Mann, which he purchased from a bookstore in Walthamstow, London. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 2011, with the judge calling his conviction \\"very unfair\\" and criticising the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for prosecuting him. The judge concluded that \\"If the [CPS] wishes to test whether the pictures in the books are indecent, the right way to deal with the matter is by way of prosecuting the publisher or retailer‚Äînot the individual purchaser.\\" References 1995 books Books of nude photography ","title":"The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)"},{"id":"38541834","text":"Sekolah Menengah Sains Rembau (; abbreviated SEMESRA) is a co-educational secondary school situated in the district of Rembau and among fully residential schools (Sekolah Berasrama Penuh) in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Established in 2009, the school is widely known as SEMESRA. In the recent PMR examination (2013), the school managed to produce 108 straight A's students with GPS 1.0535 to become the third best school in Negeri Sembilan. On 30 October 2014, SEMESRA was awarded with the Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi or High Performance School title, a title awarded to schools in Malaysia that have met stringent criteria including academic achievement, strength of alumni, international recognition, network and linkages. History Sekolah Menengah Sains Rembau, Negeri Sembilan (SEMESRA) was established on 1 October 2009. On 5 January 2010, the first Principal, Dato' Haji Azam bin Md Atan registered for duty as the Super Principal of SEMESRA. He was assisted by the Vice Principals; Tn Hj Baharudin Husin (Academics), Tn Hj Azman Awang (Student Affairs), and Pn Roslina Aziz (Co-curriculum). The institution's first intake of students was on 16 November 2009 when 130 Form One students registered. Now, the school caters to more than 800 students. As one of the elite residential schools in Malaysia, one of SEMESRA's main purposes is to produce future leaders with first-class mind and multi-talented skills. To ensure that this mission is achieved, there are more than 50 well-experienced and skilful teachers teaching in SEMESRA. Being a green horn among the well-established schools in Malaysia has not stopped SEMESRA from achieving success in both the curricular and co-curricular fields. Each success has been the result of co- operation, teamwork, effort and perseverance from the teachers and students. After Dato' Haji Azam officially retired in April 2011, the successor, Puan Norzila Idris took realm as the new Principal. She was the perfect fit to continue the task of thrusting SEMESRA into a greater level, which was evident by the many changes that had been brought forth upon her taking office. Student selection is divided into two. For entry into Form One, selection is based on the achievement in the Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR). For entry into Form Four, the students are selected based on their excellent results in the Penilaian Menengah Rendah (PMR) nationwide. These two entry selections also take the co-curricular factors into consideration. The selection process is made by the Ministry of Education, as per all Malaysian public residential schools (SBP). Intakes for Form One may cater for over 150 boys and girls, while new intakes of Form Four students may be around 50 to 60 boys and girls (at most). Enrollment for each academic year is divided into three intakes. In the year 2011, SEMESRA students sat for their first public examinations, with Extrovert 0913 batch sat for PMR while Valedictorian 1011 batch sat for SPM. The first SPM result sat by Valedictorian 1011 managed to place SEMESRA in the 7th spot nationwide, with a remarkable GPS of 1.3006 among other elite schools in the SPM 2011 ranking. In the year 2012, with a GPS of 1.0408, 119 out of 150 students managed to get straight A's in the PMR 2011 examinations, allowing SEMESRA to be ranked in the 9th spot nationwide and became the second best school in Negeri Sembilan that year. Due to its outstanding performance in many aspects, SEMESRA was awarded Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi award on 30 October 2014. Location The new campus is located opposite to a housing area, Taman Desa Permai Kundur, some 7 km from the North-South Expressway (Pedas-Linggi exit), 12 km from the Rembau town, and 38 km from the town of Seremban. Activities=Co-Curriculum= Apart from results in academic, the school also actively participates in co- curricular activities. The school teams excel regularly in cadets, chess, public speaking, choral speaking, choir, drama and debates, with records in winning the district- and states-level competitions. Some of the sports teams also managed to record considerable feats, particularly in athletics, and rugby. Other popular sports in SEMESRA are archery, football, netball, basketball, hockey, tennis, petanque, cricket, badminton, futsal and volleyball. Some of these teams have names on their own; such as Ryders/Storm (Basketball), Lycans (Rugby) and Valiant (Netball). =Internationalisation= The school‚Äôs internationalisation initiative is one of the school's main annual agenda, aimed to expose the students beyond the campus ground, particularly to the different learning environment. Through this initiative, SEMESRA forged ties and agreements with various foreign educational institutions, apart from going for humanitarian missions. In 2011, the school‚Äôs delegation flew to Lombok, Indonesia and visited several educational institutions, whereby the delegation signed MoU with them. In the same year, some students also went to Cambodia and Vietnam for a humanitarian mission. The following year, SEMESRA paid visits to several schools in Padang, Indonesia. This year (2014), the school delegates went to visit Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Apart from that, SEMESRA students also participate in student-exchange programmes, Japan-East Asia Network of Exchange for Students and Youths (JENESYS) which is held every year. This opportunity is opened to students who take Japanese as their third language, allowing them to be exposed to the environment in Japan. Symbols The motto is Tekun Bersatu Berjaya Terbilang while the school official colours are white, black and maroon. The school flag is a white flag with four-coloured stripes (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) representing the four houses which accommodate the students, with the school emblem placed at the centre of the flag. The main symbol commonly associated to the school is the Islamic geometry motives, which are seen in the school emblem, school building architectures, and the official sarongs and sampings (worn by students every Friday). Houses There are two hostel blocks which houses the boys and girls each. Each hostel is supervised by teacher-wardens who live in the warden‚Äôs unit in the same building. To look after the discipline and the well being of the students in the hostels, the warden is helped by prefects appointed from the more senior students. Each floor of the hostel is further divided into \\"Houses\\" named after the four Undang Luak of Negeri Sembilan, each indicated by a colour: Kelana Petra (Blue), Akhirul Zaman (Red), Johan Pahlawan (Green) and Lela Maharaja (Yellow). The house system promotes the spirit of co-operation among boys and girls in the same house and provides competition in games, athletics, cleanliness (3K), academics and debates. All these account for the scores obtained by each house, of which the house with the highest score will be awarded as the best house of the year.

Installations made of Pate de verre, sculptures and glass panels are presented worldwide.  Life  Ursula Huth grew up with three siblings in Laupheim, Germany. At the age of 16 she taught herself on the enamelling technique. First she concentrated on the design with clear enamels. From 1972 until 1979 she studied painting and glass design at State Academy of Fine Arts, Stuttgart (Germany) under H.G. von Stockhausen as well as Art History at Stuttgart University. It was Stockhausen who introduced the material glass to her, prompting her to say \\"There I could bring my enamels out of the cellar into the light.\\" She experienced the dissolution of the traditional linkage between stained glass and architecture in favour of the ‚Äòautonomous panel‚Äô.Peter Schmitt in: LWL-Industriemuseum: Glasland - Ursula Huth, 2009, , p.13 After she finished her studies the Studio Glass Movement reached Europe. A scholarship of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) made it possible for her to pursue her study from 1980 until 1982 at Rhode Island School of Design in Providence and she graduated with a Master in Fine Arts. There Dale Chihuly had been in charge of its glass program for ten years. Ursula Huth learned how to handle hot glass. Later on she taught at the Pilchuck Glass School. Influenced by the American Studio Glass Movement Huth creates sculptures made of glass in technical diversity by using pictorial and graphic instruments. Already during the late 1970s the compositions deviate from the strong scheme to a free split of space with a spontaneous transformation, amongst others through etching, engraving, sandblasting as well as black and coloured enamels. Coincidental an approach takes place to graphic themes which symbolically recur and are completed by further archaic symbols and naive appearing scribbles. Huth studied with Chihuly at the Rhode Island School of Design, fusing images on glass and experimenting with pate- de-verre techniques. Eventually developing her stained glass technique with designs that look as though they are drawn freehand, balanced with the control needed to work with the glass.. For her pictures Ursula Huth uses multiple flashed glass, which is made especially in the Glass factory Lamberts in Waldsassen (Germany) according to her requirements. Her work as an artist is inspired by several trips and work studies to India, Indonesia, Japan and Nepal. There she faced traditional work and tried ancient techniques. All those experiences are still part of today's work. Since 1994 Ursula Huth is married to Christoph Klett, who is also an artist. She is living and working in T√ºbingen (Germany).  Lectureships  Since 1979 until today Ursula Huth has taught at professional schools and universities. That function led her to Australia, Belgium, France, Great Britain, India, Ireland, Japan, Scotland, Swizzerland, Ukraine and to the United States.

Born in Tarutung, Dutch East Indies, he took up journalism at an early age and by age 20 had led two publications. After a time working in Medan, he went to the capital at Batavia (now Jakarta) with Adam Malik. After dabbling in politics and advertising, he established Antara together with three other reporters, heading the agency for a year between 1938 and 1939. Although he remained active as a reporter after leaving the agency, his health failed quickly and he died in a sanatorium near Yogyakarta. Early life and career Sipahoetar, an ethnic Batak, was born in Tarutung, Tapanuli, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) on 26 August 1914. A nationalist, he took up an interest in journalism while young. Together with his friend Adam Malik he established a branch of the Indonesian Party (Partindo) in Pematang Siantar around 1932; during this time he also established the short-lived magazine Sinar Marhaen and led the daily Zaman Kita together with Arif Lubis. Both publications had folded by 1934, and Sipahoetar became a correspondent with the Medan-based Pewarta Deli. He soon grew dissatisfied with this position and followed Malik to Batavia (now Jakarta), the colony's capital. There he became involved with the underground nationalist movement; one of its leaders, Djohan Sjahroezah, found him a job at a Dutch-owned advertiser named Arta. Antara While with Arta, Sipahoetar also wrote for various local publications, covering politics and crime. This included Tjaja Timoer, under Soemanang Soerjowinoto. Soemanang, pleased by Sipahoetar's writing, invited him to collaborate. Both were dissatisfied as the existing Indies' news agency, Aneta, gave little space to local news. After several months of preparations, their new agency Antara was formally established on 13 December 1937. Soemanang, as the senior reporter, was made editor-in-chief, while Sipahoetar became a senior editor; Malik also joined the agency as a senior editor. After Soemanang left the agency in 1938, Sipahoetar was elevated to managing editor. Meanwhile, he left Partindo to join the anti-fascist Indonesian People's Movement (Gerindo) under Amir Sjarifuddin. The movement helped him establish a new magazine, Toedjoean Rakjat, in 1938. Around 1939 Sipahoetar fell ill with a lung disease and he returned to Sumatra to rest. He was briefly replaced as managing editor of Antara by Alwi Soetan Osman, an employee of the Indies' Ministry of Justice, before long-time Antara employee Pandoe Kartawigoena took up the position. Later life Sipahoetar returned to Batavia after he felt healthy again, although he remained in poor physical condition. He remained politically active and continued writing for various publications, including the Chinese- owned newspaper Keng Po and the Indonesian-backed Kebangoenan. For his political activities the Dutch government arrested Sipahoetar. He was imprisoned first in Sukabumi, then in Garut and Nusakambangan. After the Japanese occupied the Indies in early 1942, Sipahoetar and his fellow political prisoners were freed and returned to Batavia to reopen Antara. However, the occupation government wanted the agency liquidated. Ultimately the company was renamed Yashima on 29 May and absorbed into the D≈çmei Tsushin news agency three months later. After his return he wrote a short biography of the nationalists Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, and Sartono. The book, titled Siapa?: Loekisan tentang Pemimpin2 (Who?: Pictures of Leaders), is credited by the Indonesian journalist Soebagijo I.N. as the first biography written in Indonesian. Sipahoetar left Domei soon afterwards because his lung disease had resurfaced. He went to Sukabumi to recuperate. There he married his nurse, Jetraningrat Kartadiwiria, in 1947. By May of that year he and his family had left for Yogyakarta, first going by train from Sukabumi to Jakarta, then joining Hamengkubuwono IX on a trip to the new capital. Sipahoetar spent the remainder of his life at a sanatorium in Pakem, north of the city, where he died on 5 January 1948. Sipahoetar was interred in Yogyakarta in a ceremony that was attended by numerous political figures, including Sjarifuddin ‚Äì by then prime minister. In 1978 his body was exhumed and moved to Tanah Kusir Cemetery in Jakarta; the reinterment was attended by government ministers Ismail Saleh and Malik.

The Highland Land League founded in 1909 was a left wing political party active in Scotland in the early twentieth century. It was separate from, although a conscious imitation of, the late 19th century Highland Land League. It was founded in Glasgow, in 1909 as a political party. This organisation was a broadly left-wing group that sought the restoration of deer forests to public ownership, abolition of plural farms and the nationalisation of the land. Also they resolved to resolutely defend crofters facing eviction by their landlords and they supported home rule for Scotland. During the First World War (1914 to 1918) politicians made lavish promises about reform which would follow the war, and of course many croftsmen lost their lives in the war itself. After the war the words of politicians did not translate into action, but croftmen returning from the war were in no mood to accept government inaction. Land raids began again. At this time the Easter Rising was recent history in Ireland, as was the Communist revolution in Russia.

He was from the Banu Kilab branch of the Qaysid tribes. Shemr was originally an Alid ally and fought against Mu'awiya at the Battle of Siffin, but later defected to Umayyads. When Ziyad ibn Abih arrested the pro-Alid Hujr ibn Adi on the charge of treason in 671, Shemr was among those who testified against Hujr. In 680, Husayn ibn Ali, a grandson of Muhammad and son of caliph Ali, sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to Kufa in response to calls from the pro-Alids to overthrow the Umayyads. Shemr, along with various other tribal notables, aided the governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad in quelling the rebellion. Shortly afterwards, Husayn arrived in Iraq and was intercepted in the desert of Karbala outside of Kufa. After Ibn Ziyad consented to a peace proposal from Husayn, Shemr reportedly opposed the proposal and convinced Ibn Ziyad to subdue Husayn with force. Shemr was subsequently sent to Karbala with orders to either force Husayn into submission or to kill him in case of refusal. A day before the battle, Shemr offered safe conduct to three paternal brothers of Husayn, including Abbas ibn Ali, whose mother, Umm ul-Banin, was from the tribe of Shemr. The offer was declined because Husayn was not offered any safe conduct. On the battle day (10 October), Shemr commanded the left wing of the Umayyad army. Upon the orders of the commander of the army, Umar ibn Sa'd, Shemr set on fire the tents of Husayn's companions, and was intent on burning Husayn's personal tent before being prevented by his own comrades. After an almost day-long sequence of skirmishes and duels, most of Husayn's companions were killed, but the Umayyad soldiers hesitated to kill Husayn. Shemr encouraged them to kill him: \\"Shame on you! Why are you waiting for the man? Kill him, may your mothers be deprived of you!\\" Shemr then led the final assault. Some accounts name him as the one who ultimately killed and decapitated Husayn, while other accounts name Sinan ibn Anas. He then attempted to kill Husayn's surviving son Ali Zayn al Abidin, but was prevented by Ibn Sa'd. Afterwards, Shemr led the escort carrying the heads of the dead to Kufa. Later he accompanied the prisoners to Syria. He is reported to have regretted his actions later in his life. During the rule of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, who had seized Kufa in October 686, Shemr was among the agitators who attempted to topple Mukhtar. After the rebellion was defeated, Shemr escaped to Sadama, a place between Kufa and Basra. Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr ruled Basra at the time and Shemr wrote him a letter requesting assistance. The letter was intercepted by Mukhtar's soldiers led by Abu Amra Kaysan. With his location thus exposed, Shemr was found and killed. Other variants suggest that he was wounded and sent to Mukhtar, who then killed him. Shia traditions relate that Shemr's body was then torn to pieces by wild dogs.  Depiction  Shemr is depicted usually wearing red with a long feathered cap in the passion plays during the Shia mourning remembrance of Ashura.

There are currently many different workflow systems. Some have been developed more generally as scientific workflow systems for use by scientists from many different disciplines like astronomy and earth science. All such systems are based on an abstract representation of how a computation proceeds in the form of a directed graph, where each node represents a task to be executed and edges represent either data flow or execution dependencies between different tasks. Each system typically provides a visual front-end, allowing the user to build and modify complex applications with little or no programming expertise.

It intersects at Rrogozhine (SH7, SH3) and runs towards Elbasan. It then crosses the border with North Macedonia at the Ohrid lake and then runs north to Tetovo mainly as a 2-lanes single-carriageway. The section between Ohrid and Kicevo will be upgraded to a motorway. A2 motorway runs between Tetovo and Skopje, and A1 motorway between Skopje and Kumanovo. Between Kumanovo and Radomir, Bulgaria, it runs again as a 2-lanes single-carriageway. From Radomir to Pernik it is upgraded to a 4-lane dual-carriageway. Close to Pernik, the route joins Lyulin motorway (A6) for about 20 km to the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. After passing through the Sofia Ring Road, the route joins Trakia motorway (A1) for to Burgas, bypassing Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora and Yambol on the way.

From Lin to Kiƒçevo new construction will be required, almost all in North Macedonia. At the moment progress on this link is small, being mainly aspirational. On the eastern side of North Macedonia the mothballed, 31 km long, line from Kumanovo-Beljakovce is being restored and upgraded \\\\- work on this started in 2014. Construction of a new line, approximately 34 km long, from Beljakovce to Kriva Palanka began in 1996 but was abandoned due to lack of financial resources in 2004. Considerable earthworks and structures are, therefore, already in existence but currently do not reach Kriva Palanka. Entirely new construction will be needed in the area of Kriva Palanka to the Bulgarian border (24 km) plus a short length (~1 km) in Bulgaria. A total of approximately 88 km of track must be restored or built in a region whose morphological features make access difficult. Once in Bulgaria, the existing line from Gyueshevo, extant since 1910, will be used. From Gyueshevo the track runs broadly northwards to Sofia then uses the main line through Burgas to Varna.

He worked mainly on summation theory. He taught various courses on mathematical analysis, functional analysis and algebra in University of Tartu and he has written several university textbooks. Biography Gunnar Kangro was born on November 21, 1913 in Tartu as the third and youngest child of a construction engineer and a building contractor. After graduating from Tartu Secondary Science School (Tartu Reaalg√ºmnaasium) in 1931 he was admitted to the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of Tartu University to study mathematics. After graduating the university in 1935 and finishing the compulsory service in Estonian Defence Forces he was appointed as junior assistant in the Laboratory of Mathematics and Mechanics in Tallinn Technical Institute (currently Tallinn University of Technology). He defended his Master's thesis in 1938 under the supervision of professor Hermann Jaakson in Tartu University. In 1940 he got a scholarship for doctoral studies from Tartu University. In July 1941, Kangro was drafted to the Red Army. He served until February 1942, when he was sent to Chelyabinsk Agricultural Mechanisation Institute. At the end of 1943, he was transferred to Moscow University, where he continued his research towards a Doctor's degree. Kangro returned to Estonia in autumn 1944, and from November onwards he started teaching at Tartu University. In 1947‚Äì48 he was the dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. He defended his Doctoral thesis in July 1947 and became a professor in 1951. In 1952‚Äì1959 he was the head of the Chair of Geometry, from 1959 until his death in 1975 he was the head of the Chair of Mathematical Analysis. Research In his Doctoral thesis he created a new theory of convergence, which generalized Borel theory of summation, and applied this to study problems connected to convergence of complex power series. He defined new summation methods and used them to characterize properties of the sum of power series and its analytic continuation. The star-shaped summability domains of power series obtained by these new summation methods enabled him to get results extending the applications of Borel summation methods in function theory. In the 1950s, he laid the basis on systematic treatment of summability factors together with German mathematicians Alexander Peyerimhoff and Wolfgang Jurkat. He combined ideas of modern functional analysis with classical analysis. Together with his student Simson Baron he started to describe the summability factors for double series. Considering applications to orthogonal series and Tauberian theorems, Kangro created a theory of summability with speed based on functional analysis, which helped him to solve several problems in function and summability theory. In addition to laying the basis for the new theory he also pointed out main directions for applications. This work was interrupted by his unexpected death in 1975. Teaching After the war Kangro had a great influence on modernizing the teaching of mathematics in Tartu State University. His courses on algebra and mathematical analysis reflected the changes taking place in these areas in the first half of the 20th century: function theory of polynomials was replaced by abstract algebra, mathematical analysis was based on axiomatic methods and set theory. His course on functional analysis became a starting point for a new research direction in numerical methods in Tartu. Kangro's main contribution was raising a new generation of mathematicians. He has supervised 23 Candidate's theses in mathematics. In addition to mathematical analysis he has also contributed to development of algebra, numarical methods and geometry in Estonia. Notable is his initiative in reorganization of mathematical higher education in University of Tartu in the 1960s in connection with increased need for computer experts.

The tree was used as a fire lookout for roughly ten to fifteen years from c. 1930 to c. 1940.

Here the star denotes convolution, Lp is Lebesgue space, and :\\\\|f\\\\|_p = \\\\Bigl(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} |f(x)|^p\\\\,dx \\\\Bigr)^{1/p} denotes the usual Lp norm. Equivalently, if p, q, r \\\\ge 1 and \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} + \\\\frac{1}{r} = 2 then : \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} f (x) g (x - y) h (y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\le \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} \\\\vert f\\\\vert^p \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} \\\\vert g\\\\vert^q \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{q}\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} \\\\vert h\\\\vert^r \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{r} =Generalizations= Young's convolution inequality has a natural generalization in which we replace \\\\mathbb{R}^d by a unimodular group G. If we let \\\\mu be a bi-invariant Haar measure on G and we let f,g:G\\\\to\\\\mathbb R or \\\\mathbb C be integrable functions, then we define f*g by : f*g(x)=\\\\int_G f(y)g(y^{-1}x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y). Then in this case, Young's inequality states that for f\\\\in L^p(G,\\\\mu) and g\\\\in L^q(G,\\\\mu) and p,q,r\\\\in[1,\\\\infty] such that : \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} = \\\\frac{1}{r} +1 we have a bound : \\\\lVert f*g\\\\rVert_r\\\\le\\\\lVert f\\\\rVert_p\\\\lVert g\\\\rVert_q. Equivalently, if p, q, r \\\\ge 1 and \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} + \\\\frac{1}{r} = 2 then : \\\\int_G \\\\int_G f (x) g (y^{-1}x) h (y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y) \\\\le \\\\left(\\\\int_G \\\\vert f\\\\vert^p \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\left(\\\\int_G \\\\vert g\\\\vert^q \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{q}\\\\left(\\\\int_G \\\\vert h\\\\vert^r \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{r}. Since \\\\mathbb{R}^d is in fact a locally compact abelian group (and therefore unimodular) with the Lebesgue measure the desired Haar measure, this is in fact a generalization. Applications An example application is that Young's inequality can be used to show that the heat semigroup is a contracting semigroup using the L2 norm (i.e. the Weierstrass transform does not enlarge the L2 norm). Proof=Proof by H√∂lder's inequality= Young's inequality has an elementary proof with the non-optimal constant 1. We assume that the functions f,g,h:G\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} are nonnegative and integrable, where G is a unimodular group endowed with a bi- invariant Haar measure \\\\mu. We use the fact that \\\\mu(S)=\\\\mu(S^{-1}) for any measurable S\\\\subset G. Since \\\\textstyle p(2 - \\\\frac{1}{q} - \\\\frac{1}{r}) = q(2 - \\\\frac{1}{p} - \\\\frac{1}{r}) = r(2 - \\\\frac{1}{p} - \\\\frac{1}{q}) = 1 : \\\\int_G \\\\int_G f (x) g (y^{-1}x) h (y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y) = \\\\int_G \\\\int_G \\\\left(f (x)^{p} g (y^{-1}x)^q \\\\right)^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{r}} \\\\left(f (x)^p h (y)^r \\\\right)^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{q}} \\\\left(g (y^{-1}x)^{q} h (y)^r \\\\right)^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{p}}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y) By the H√∂lder inequality for three functions we deduce that : \\\\int_G \\\\int_G f (x) g (y^{-1}x) h (y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y) \\\\le \\\\left(\\\\int_G \\\\int_G f (x)^{p} g (y^{-1}x)^q \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y) \\\\right)^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{r}} \\\\left( \\\\int_G \\\\int_G f (x)^p h (y)^r \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y) \\\\right)^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{q}} \\\\left(\\\\int_G \\\\int_G g (y^{-1}x)^{q} h (y)^r \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(y)\\\\right)^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{p}}. The conclusion follows then by left-invariance of the Haar measure, the fact that integrals are preserved by inversion of the domain, and by Fubini's theorem. =Proof by interpolation= Young's inequality can also be proved by interpolation; see the article on Riesz‚ÄìThorin interpolation for a proof. Sharp constant In case p, q > 1 Young's inequality can be strengthened to a sharp form, via : \\\\|f*g\\\\_r\\\\le c_{p,q} \\\\|f\\\\|_p\\\\|g\\\\|_q. where the constant cp,q < 1. When this optimal constant is achieved, the function f and g are multidimensional Gaussian functions.

At the age of 13, she was afflicted with polio and spent two years in a hip-to-shoulder cast. She attended Indiana University in Bloomington. In the mid-1950s, she married Joseph Warner; a son resulted from the marriage, which ended after only a few years. In 1982, she married NYPD officer Joseph \\"Joe\\" Arthur Knedlhans, which lasted until her death from breast cancer.

Other film appearances included Wake Me When It's Over in 1960 with Ernie Kovacs, Dick Shawn, Jack Warden, and Don Knotts, and 1961's fictionalized biography The George Raft Story starring Ray Danton, Jayne Mansfield, Julie London, and Frank Gorshin. Moore also guest-starred on the American television dramas Perry Mason in \\"The Case of the Capering Camera\\" in 1964 and Run for Your Life episode \\"The Rape of Lucrece\\" starring Ben Gazzara in 1968. She was a lifetime member of both the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists After her film career ended, Moore turned to business pursuits. She owned a San Francisco portrait photography studio in the 1970s and in the mid-1980s she returned to New York City to run The Chocolate Garden, a candy shop at 79th Street and Third Avenue.

It was created in 2010 for a campaign created to draw tourists to the region after the Kyushu Shinkansen line opened. Kumamon subsequently became nationally popular, and in late 2011, was voted top in a nationwide survey of mascots, collectively known as yuru-chara, garnering over 280,000 votes. Following his success in the contest, Kumamoto earned (, , ) in merchandising revenue for the first half of 2012, after having only earned (, , ) throughout all of 2011. Kumamon enjoys tremendous popularity throughout the world.  Economic impact  In just two years, Kumamon has generated US$1.2 billion in economic benefits for his region, including tourism and product sales, as well as US$90 million worth of publicity, according to a recent Bank of Japan study. Sales of Kumamon items have reached ¬•29.3 billion in 2012, up from ¬•2.5 billion in 2011. The Bank of Japan also estimated that Kumamon generated in revenue during a two-year period starting from 2011.  Success  A large part of Kumamon's success can be attributed to its cuteness. The unusual marketing strategy of free licensing is also behind Kumamon's commercial success, since the Kumamoto prefecture grants usage rights for free to anyone as long as their products promote goods and services from the prefecture. Furthermore, in 2018, the Kumamoto prefecture decided to allow foreign businesses to use Kumamon, aiming to expand Kumamon to the world. https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/01/04/business/kumamoto-prefecture- decides-allow-foreign-firms-use-kumamon-bear-brand/#.W7qsixNKiYU Cultural impact This mascot has a minor cameo in the 2014 video game Yo-Kai Watch 2, and made an appearance in Yo-kai Watch: The Movie, following the main characters (Whisper, Nate, and Jibanyan) around. It also gained internet popularity when images of Kumamon, usually around large fires, were captioned with \\"Why? For the glory of Satan, of course!\\". The Kumamoto Prefecture has taken this well, but has more carefully restricted official photography of the mascot. BTS member Suga is a well known fan of Kumamon, with a video of him meeting the mascot for the first time going viral.
