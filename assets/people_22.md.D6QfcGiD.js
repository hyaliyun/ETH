The airport is located in the village of Hasvik on the island of S√∏r√∏ya. In 2012, Hasvik Airport had 7,629 passengers, making it the third-least busy airport operated by the state-owned Avinor. The airport consists of a runway and is served by Wider√∏e with Dash 8-100 aircraft. Planning started in 1972 for an airport to serve air taxi and air ambulance services. The original gravel runway opened on 17 May 1973, allowing Norving to operate flights with their Britten-Norman Islanders. The airport was upgraded with a longer runway and a larger terminal in 1983, allowing Norving to start scheduled services to Alta and Hammerfest. Wider√∏e took over the routes in 1990, at first using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. The runway was asphalted in 1995, allowing Wider√∏e to introduce the Dash 8. The airport was nationalized two years later. History The first aircraft in Hasvik was an emergency landing carried out en route to Svalbard in the early 1970s. The plain where the aircraft landed, located near the village, became the site of the airport. The regional airline Norving took the initiative in 1972 to construct a simple airfield at Hasvik; they hoped to finance along with the municipality, the National Insurance Administration and the local chapter of the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps.Melling: 92 In addition to being able to operate an air taxi service and land air ambulances, locals hoped that the construction would be a first step to becoming part of the state-financed construction of regional airports in Finnmark. However, Hasvik was not selected as one of the original regional airports.Melling: 105 Passengers disembarking aircraft at Hasvik Airport The initial airport consisted of a gravel runway and a spartan terminal consisting of no more than a shack. The airport opened on 17 May 1973 and Norving started an air taxi service using the eight-passenger Britten-Norman Islander. Grants of 3.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) were issued from the state in 1981, which was supplemented with funding from Norving, the National Insurance Administration, Kommunalbanken and local interests. The new facilities opened in early 1983, consisting of a larger terminal and control tower and a lengthening of the runway‚Äîalthough it retained the gravel surface. The upgrades cost NOK 5.8 million; they allowed Norving to operate a daily scheduled taxi route to Hammerfest and Alta, and for the first time Hasvik was able to receive same- day newspapers. The flights corresponded with Scandinavian Airlines System's Oslo-flights at Alta Airport.Melling: 106 Norving operated at the airport until 1990, when the route was taken over by Wider√∏e, who initially used the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). Along with B√•tsfjord Airport and Vard√∏ Airport, Svartnes, Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Wider√∏e articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway. Wider√∏e stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would no longer be able to serve the airport. Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995, subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997. The runway lights were upgraded in 2008 and 2009, followed by the installation of the Global Positioning System-based landing system SCAT-I. Avinor wants to extend most short airports to 1200 m by year 2030, because they see a lack of aircraft types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways. Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports. There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats. Land reclamation in order to expand the airfield could be considered, however it is economically unviable. Facilities Hasvik Airport has a simple terminal building with a capacity for 20 passengers per hour. It has a asphalt runway aligned 11/29. The tarmac has a place for one airliner. There is a harbor southeast of the runway which limits any expansion. The airport is located two minutes drive from the village center; free parking is available. Airlines and destinations View of Hasvik Airport, with Wider√∏e Dash 8-100 aircraft on take-off roll The airport is served by Wider√∏e, who operates flights based on a public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. All flights are operated using 39-seat Dash 8-100 aircraft. Flights are flown to Troms√∏ and Hammerfest and can continue to other villages and towns in Finnmark. In 2014 the airport served 7,629 passengers, 1,272 aircraft movements and handled 0.2 tonnes of cargo. Hasvik is the third-least busy airport operated by Avinor, ahead of Berlev√•g Airport and Fagernes Airport, Leirin.

Perhaps best known as an essayist, who dealt with both historical and political matters, he also authored a number of books on a variety of subjects. An exile from the Nazi regime, deeply concerned with the lessons offered by the Weimar Republic, he taught at the New School for Social Research and then at the City College of the City University of New York until his death in 1980. Biography Born in 1907 in Berlin, Pachter joined the German Youth Movement as a teenager and, following a split in its ranks, the German Communist Party (KPD) in 1926. He enrolled in the history department at the University of Berlin and, by 1928, found himself expelled from the KPD. He then joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD), where he worked under Rudolf Hilferding at the legendary journal, Society, and finished his dissertation in 1932 on ‚ÄúThe Proletariat Before 1848.‚Äù He would remain a libertarian socialist for the rest of his life. By the end of 1933, Pachter had been forced to flee to Paris where he took odd jobs, taught at the Universite Populaire, agitated for creating a ‚Äúpopular front‚Äù of all antifascist forces, and ultimately served as a publicist for the POUM, a mixed group of Trotskyist and socialists that served the loyalist cause during the Spanish Civil War. Briefly a member of the anti-Nazi underground in which he helped edit probably the first resistance journal, Proletarian Action, he wound up in the Gurs prison camp, before coming to the United States in 1940. Soon enough he was working for the Office of Strategic Services, and part-time for the Institute for Social Research at Columbia University, before becoming a founding member of Dissent and entering the academy. Theoretical contributions Henry Pachter understood Marxism as a critical method capable of questioning its political employment from a historical and materialist standpoint that emphasized the ability of the working class (rather than a party) to control its destiny. He never viewed it as a ‚Äúscience‚Äù or a form of economics guaranteeing the inevitable victory of the proletariat. In this respect, his intellectual lineage derived from Karl Korsch and the libertarian socialism associated with Rosa Luxemburg. His writings were primarily inspired by his political commitments: a work on the Weimar Republic and the Spanish Civil War; a study of economic policy under Mussolini and another dealing with the fascist use of language; the character of authoritarian political parties; foreign policy; the role of reform, and the meaning of socialism. In Pachter‚Äôs view, socialism exhibited a fundamental tension between its need to engage the world even as it projects a vision of society as it should be. That tension prevented Pachter from identifying socialism with any movement or party. Indeed, as he once put the matter: ‚ÄúOne cannot have socialism; one is a socialist.‚Äù Works * Socialism in History: Political Writings of Henry Pachter, ed.

Prior to 1 October 2008 the bridge was referred to as the upper Forth crossing while the name was chosen.BBC news report, 1 October 2008 Background Clackmannanshire Bridge (left) over the River Forth The increasing levels of traffic using the existing Kincardine Bridge led to a public inquiry being held into options to ease traffic flow over the Forth and around the small town of Kincardine. The Kincardine Bridge was the main access across the river for heavy goods vehicles during stormy weather when the Forth Road Bridge would not allow high sided vehicles to cross during strong winds. In 2000 proposals were put forward for a number of alternatives, one of which was a new crossing running north-northwest of the existing bridge, bypassing the town of Kincardine altogether. In 2005 the new crossing was given the go-ahead, and construction began in June 2006, with the sod-cutting ceremony performed by the Scottish Transport Minister, Tavish Scott, accompanied by the Earl of Elgin who as a boy had performed the ceremony for the Kincardine Bridge. The bridge was officially opened by Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond on 28 November 2008. At the ceremony, Salmond said: \\"This is a world-class infrastructure project which will cut journey times, improve central Scotland connections, and provide a unique gateway to Clackmannanshire, Fife and Falkirk\\". Description The final cost of the project was ¬£120 million and it was designed to accommodate about 20,000 vehicle movements per day.News Herald Scotland The bridge deck is long, weighs and sits on 25 piers which are each filled with of concrete. Naming The bridge is positioned in an area where three council area boundaries converge. The north approach road to the bridge leaves from Clackmannanshire, the bridge itself standing in Fife, and the south approach to the bridge is within Falkirk. This means that the span of the bridge is within Fife; however, it can only be accessed by travelling through either Clackmannanshire or Falkirk council areas. Due to this unique situation a minor row over naming broke out between those local authorities with a vested interest. Clackmannanshire Council voted to suggest \\"Clackmannanshire Bridge\\" - even though two other councils, Fife and Falkirk, are involved and no part of the bridge would be inside the Clackmannanshire area. Fife Council responded with \\"Kingdom Bridge\\" (referring to the historic kingdom of Fife). Other suggestions included \\"Wallace Bridge\\" after Sir William Wallace. Following a public consultation, the Scottish Government announced on 1 October 2008 that the name Clackmannanshire Bridge was to be adopted.

The highway runs for as a two-lane road from an intersection with U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) in the Greene County town of New Baltimore to a junction with NY 32 in the town of Bethlehem just south of the Albany city limits. NY 144 closely parallels the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87 or I-87) and the west bank of the Hudson River as it heads across Albany County. The Thruway and NY 144 connect at exit 22 about south of Albany in Bethlehem. NY 144 was originally designated as part of NY 10 in the mid-1920s and as part of US 9W from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 144 was assigned to what is now US 9W between New Baltimore and Albany. The alignments of US 9W and NY 144 were flipped in the mid-1930s, placing the latter on a routing that extended north from Bethlehem to downtown Albany. NY 144 was truncated to its present length in the late 1960s. Route description NY 144 northbound approaching the Albany County line in the town of New Baltimore NY 144 begins at an intersection with US 9W in the town of New Baltimore, just north of US 9W's junction with County Route 51 (CR 51). The route heads northeastward through New Baltimore as a two-lane rural roadway, crossing CSX Transportation's West Shore Line before intersecting with a service road that connects to the New Baltimore Travel Plaza on the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY 144 passes by a stretch of homes alongside the Thruway and crosses over the toll road, at which point the road enters a residential but wooded area of the town. This stretch leads to the hamlet of New Baltimore, located on the west bank of the Hudson River. In the residential center of the community, NY 144 intersects with the northern terminus of CR 61 (River Road). At this junction, NY 144 makes a turn northward, following the riverbank out of the hamlet. Continuing northward, NY 144 heads through gradually less developed areas as it crosses the Greene‚ÄìAlbany county line and enters the town of Coeymans. It crosses Hannacrois Creek just north of the county line on its way into the nearby hamlet of Coeymans, where the route becomes known as Main Street. NY 144 runs north‚Äìsouth through the small residential community, intersecting with the eastern terminus of NY 143 (Church Street) and passing over Coeymans Creek before exiting the area and becoming River Road. Outside of Coeymans, NY 144 heads northward along a strip of land bounded by Coeymans Creek to the west and the Hudson River to the east. It serves a large industrial complex and passes under a long pipeline connection in an otherwise undeveloped and wooded area before trending to the northwest toward the nearby New York State Thruway. NY 144 comes within of the Thruway's northbound lanes before turning back to the northeast. The two highways remain close for the next , with both roads continuing to traverse wooded areas of the town of Coeymans. NY 144 serves a handful of isolated housing tracts before passing over a railroad line and under the Berkshire Connector of the Thruway, which terminates just west of the overpass at Thruway exit 21A. Past the connector, the amount of development along NY 144 slowly increases as the highway crosses into the town of Bethlehem. Here, the route intersects the eastern terminus of NY 396 (Maple Avenue) just east of Selkirk and finally connects to the Thruway at the toll road's exit 22, located just north of the NY 396 junction. After the Thruway exit, the freeway heads off to the north while NY 144 takes a slightly northeasterly track toward Cedar Hill and Wemple, two small riverside hamlets about apart on opposite sides of Vioman Kill. NY 144 approaching the long pipeline cover in the town of Coeymans North of Wemple, the sporadic residences along the highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY 144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY 144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY 32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany‚ÄìRensselaer, where the NY 144 designation terminates. NY 32 continues northward from this point on NY 144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany. History The first piece of NY 144 brought into the state highway system began with the portion of NY 144 between Selkirk and Greene County line as SH 508\\\\. A long stretch of highway, SH 508 was to cost $41,000 (1907 USD) to reconstruct to state standards. The contract was let on September 5, 1907 to the Elmore and Hamilton Contracting Company to put new limestone on the top course of the new roadway and approved stones for the bottom. Work commenced in June 1908 and was completed three months later. Most of modern NY 144 was originally designated as part of NY 10 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY 10 joined what is now NY 144 at Coeymans and followed it north through Bethlehem to Albany, where NY 10 continued into the city on modern NY 32. When U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927, all of NY 10 south of Albany became part of US 9W. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US 9W was realigned through the towns of New Baltimore and Coeymans to use modern NY 144 instead. At the same time, the portion of what is now US 9W from New Baltimore to Albany was designated as NY 144. The alignments of US 9W and NY 144 north of New Baltimore were flipped in April 1935. Initially, NY 144 entered Albany, overlapping with NY 32 along South Pearl Street to US 20 in the downtown district. It was truncated to its current northern terminus south of Albany in the late 1960s.

While Gwynne did not take a stance on whether The Protocols were authentic or not, he did claim that \\"the Jewish Bolsheviks\\" in Russia were \\"carrying out almost to the letter\\" the program outlined in The Protocols.

He was the original founder of Microwave Communications Inc., better known as MCI Inc.Skrzycki, Cindy (1993) \\"Jack Goeken: Visionary Link to MCI's Unspoken Past\\", Washington Post, June 28, 1993 Goeken was an unwitting monopoly-buster, but his technological innovations made him one of the most significant inventors of the late 20th century. Founding of MCI According to various press reports and the book \\"On the Line\\" by Larry Kahaner, Jack Goeken founded MCI in the 1960s so that he could expand his radio-repair business. He reasoned that if he could set up a microwave repeater system between Chicago and St. Louis, he would be able to sell more radios to truckers. When Goeken tried to apply for a license to establish his repeater system, he learned that AT&T; had a monopoly on such communications, and that he would be denied a license. Goeken, being a tenacious entrepreneur, challenged against what he believed to be an injustice using the court system.Hooper, Larry (2000) \\"Jack Goeken: Telecom Entrepreneur\\", ChannelWeb, November 8, 2000, retrieved 2010-01-20 Eventually, the lawsuit he filed would lead to the breakup of AT&T; and usher in an era of competition for the telecommunications industry. Other companies MCI made Goeken a multimillionaire, and he used his personality and wealth to found many other innovative companies, including the FTD Mercury Network (flower delivery), Airfone (later sold to GTE), In-Flight Phone Corp., and many others. Mr. Goeken established Goeken Group Corporation as the vehicle to manage his business ventures. After selling Airfone Corp. to GTE Corp., Goeken alleged that GTE breached their contract by not allowing him to run the company as he saw fit, and he asked a court to void his non-compete agreement. A court agreed, and Goeken then founded In-Flight Phone Corporation in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, with the intent of competing with GTE Airfone, which held a monopoly on air-to-ground telecommunications.Mary Peterson Kauffold (1992) \\"John Goeken has kept failure at a long distance\\", Chicago Tribune, Apr 19, 1992 In 1990, the FCC approved Goeken's plan to share the Airfone frequencies, and solicited applications for and subsequently issued licences to several companies to operate digital Terrestrial Aeronautical Public Correspondence (TAPC) services. In-Flight Phone Corp. was awarded one of these licenses, and Goeken was clear to compete with GTE Airfone. In-Flight Phone Corporation attracted more than $200 million from investors, and Goeken set out to build the first nationwide digital air-to-ground telecommunications network, capable of delivering static-free telephone calls, internet service and information services, to airplane seats. The company successfully competed for service contracts with USAir and other airlines. In 1996, Goeken sold In- Flight Phone Corp. to MCI Corp.

The park is a historical destination as well as a recreational destination. Visitors to the park can cross a covered bridge and observe a restored and operating grist mill. The park is also home to Holman Lake a popular fishing lake in Perry County and several hundred acres are open to hunting. Little Buffalo State Park is a mile southwest of Newport just off Pennsylvania Route 34. History Little Buffalo State Park is named for Little Buffalo Creek which runs through the park. The creek and the nearby Buffalo Ridge are named for the bison that are believed to have once roamed the ridge and valley region of Pennsylvania. Humans have lived in what is now Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first settlers were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi- permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000 BC and 1500 AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrow, and ornaments. Perry County was part of the Albany Purchase of 1754 when the colonists purchased a large tract of land from the Iroquois League of Six Nations. Settlement of the area did not begin in force until after the American Revolution. The early settlers cleared the land for farming. Much of this land is still farmed today. John Koch, one of the first to farm the area in the 1790s, opened the Blue Ball Tavern in 1811. This tavern served travellers on the Carlisle Pike between Carlisle and Sunbury. The tavern offered food, drink, and a sleeping loft. It became a gathering spot for locals as they discussed the news and gossip of the day. The Blue Ball Tavern served as a rest stop for messengers who travelled between Carlisle and Sunbury during the War of 1812. Rumor has it that the tavern was where the plans for the creation of Perry County were made in 1821. The tavern was closed in 1841. A farmhouse was built in 1865 on the foundation of the tavern. Some recycled boards and hardware from the tavern were used in the construction of the farmhouse which currently houses the Blue Ball Tavern Museum and a library that are operated by the Perry County Historical Society. The early days of the Newport area are tied to the charcoal industry. Before the discovery of coal, charcoal was used to fire the furnaces of the iron furnaces. The demand for charcoal was great. One iron furnace could consume of forest in one day. Massive charcoal furnaces were built near Newport to meet these needs. The charcoal was created by stacking timber around large hearths. The hearths were fired by a collier. The collier tended the hearths for 10 to 14 days until the charcoal was ready. The charcoal was then sent to the Juniata Iron Works which was in operation until 1848 when all the wood in the surrounding area had been consumed. Reminders of the charcoal industry are visible today at Little Buffalo State Park. Large circular areas of mostly barren land are located at the sites of the former furnaces and pieces of charcoal can still be found in the woods of the park. The land was not left to waste after the Juniata Iron Works was shut down in 1848. Farmers stayed on the land and it was actively farmed until the 1960s. William Shoaff bought of land and a gristmill from the Juniata Iron Works in 1849 after it had been shut down. The local farmers brought their crops to Shoaff's Mill until the 1940s. The mill has since been restored and is back in operation. Visitors to the park can observe the milling of cornmeal, cracked corn and the grinding of apples for apple cider. Little Buffalo State Park was opened to the public in 1972. The effort to create the park was led by Allan W. Holman, Jr. Holman was a member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and represented the area. Holman Lake is named in his honor. Wildlife Little Buffalo Creek and Holman Lake create an excellent habitat for a great variety of wild animals. The waters of the creek and lake are warm. This makes for an ideal habitat for crappie, sunfish and largemouth bass. The bass will eat just about anything in the lake. They prey on ducklings, crayfish, frogs and even other fish. Holman Lake has a very large population of yellow perch. The population of the yellow perch has been managed by the stocking of walleye, muskellunge, and channel catfish. This large population with such a tremendous variety of fish has made Holman Lake a very popular fishing lake. Holman Lake is a designated \\"Big Bass Lake\\". This means that the only fish anglers are allowed to keep must be at least 15 inches long with a daily limit of 4 bass. The fish population draws birds to the waters of Holman Lake. Bald eagles and osprey do not nest at Little Buffalo State Park, but they do fish the waters. Great blue heron and green heron wade in the shallows of the lake in search of fish, frogs and crayfish. Wood ducks make their home at the lake along with mallards and Canada geese. The woods and field surrounding the lake are the home of the once rare bluebird. These birds became endangered due to the loss habitat. They nested only in tree cavities. People have helped the bluebird by constructing birdhouses that mimic the woodpecker holes that bluebirds would naturally use to build their nests. Turkeys and ruffed grouse live in and thrive in the forests of Little Buffalo State Park. The streams and lakeshores of Little Buffalo State Park are the home to the nocturnal hunter the mink. The park is also a habitat for woodland mammals such as the white-tailed deer, red and gray squirrel, rabbits, chipmunks, and black bear. Little Buffalo State Park has a population of snakes and turtles. The red spotted newt lives near the lake. This amphibian is often confused with a lizard. It is five inches (127 mm) long and is green with red spots. These newts are numerous because they are not eaten by the many fish of the lake. The skin of the newt secretes a mild toxin that makes it unpalatable to fish. Recreation Holman Lake in the fall Little Buffalo State Park offers many recreational opportunities for visitors to the park. Picnics There are two picnic areas at Little Buffalo State Park. Both areas have a view of Lake Holman and are largely shaded by oak, maple and ash trees. The Main Picnic Area is close to the swimming pool. It shares a first-aid station, shower area, and food concession with the pool. The picnic area is also the location of a playground, horseshoe pits, two pavilions, restrooms, picnic tables and grills and a boat rental station. The East Picnic Area is near the historical covered bridge and farmhouse. It has restrooms, picnic tables and grills, a horseshoe pit, a pavilion, an environmental interpretive center and the Moore Performing Arts Pavilion. Swimming The park includes swimming pool that has two slides and a sprayground. Holman Lake Holman Lake is open year-round to fishing and boating. It is a \\"Big Bass Lake\\"; only bass or longer may be kept, with a daily limit of four per angler. The lake has a native population of largemouth bass, catfish and panfish. It is stocked with brook, brown and rainbow trout. The high population of yellow perch is controlled by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission by stocking muskellunge and walleye. All of these fish are targeted by recreational fisherman on a year-round basis, from shore, boat and during the winter months on the ice cover. Electric- powered, gas-powered, and non-powered boats are permitted on the waters of Holman Lake with current registration from any state. Although gas-powered boats are permitted, the engine(s) are not allowed to be used. They must be powered by an electric motor or rowing. The lake is open in the winter for ice skating and ice fishing. Hunting Hunting is permitted on about of Little Buffalo State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and eastern cottontail. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.

Early records were pressed in Louisville, Kentucky, but because of their poor quality Nathan set up his own record-pressing plant in 1944 on the premises at 1540 Brewster Avenue in Cincinnati, the home of King Records for the next 25 years. He also set up a recording studio at that site and made his own distribution arrangements across the Midwest rather than relying on national companies. He set up the Queen label to record R&B; artists in 1945, but it was soon absorbed into the King label. Over the years, King assimilated many other smaller labels, including DeLuxe, and set up several subsidiaries, such as Federal. The company's talent scouts found many future recording stars. Early signings to the King label or its subsidiaries included Bull Moose Jackson, Lucky Millinder, Tiny Bradshaw, Earl Bostic, Eddie \\"Cleanhead\\" Vinson, Wynonie Harris, the Dominoes, Little Willie John, Bill Doggett, and Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, whose song \\"Work with Me, Annie\\" was one of the label's biggest successes. Nathan successfully recorded country performers, such as the Delmore Brothers, the Stanley Brothers, Moon Mullican, Cowboy Copas and Grandpa Jones, and also gospel singers. He actively encouraged white performers to record R&B; songs and black performers to record country songs, not as an attempt at integration but as a way of maximising his song publishing revenue. Nathan said: > We saw a need. Why should we go into all those towns and only sell to the > hillbilly accounts? Why can't we sell a few more while we're there? So we > got in the race business. According to his citation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: > In the process of working with black R&B; and white country artists, Nathan > helped effect a cross-pollination of the two worlds, thereby helping lay the > groundwork for the musical hybrid known as rock and roll. In 1956, the talent scout Ralph Bass signed James Brown to King, where Brown recorded \\"Please, Please, Please\\". Nathan reportedly commented at the time, \\"That's the worse piece of crap I've heard in my life. It's someone stuttering on a record only saying one word ...\\". However, the record was a success. Nathan and Brown had a volatile relationship over the years,Biography by Steve Kurutz at Allmusic.com. Retrieved 26 July 2013 but Brown later said of Nathan, \\"I would be telling a lie if I said I would be a world star without the help of men like Mr. Nathan. He was the first one willing to take a chance on me.\\" Brown continued to record for King, despite occasional lawsuits between the two and Nathan's initial refusal to fund Brown's album Live at the Apollo, recorded in 1962, which was one of his most successful and influential, reaching number 2 on the US album chart. King Records was noted as one of the first racially integrated companies in the US record business and as \\"one of the few recording companies to make a record from start to finish, all under one roof.\\"International Bluegrass Music Museum: Syd Nathan.

Retrieved 26 July 2013. However, King's impact declined in the 1960s, after Nathan was implicated in the payola scandal. In addition to credits received in his own name, Nathan used the pseudonym Lois Mann for song publishing and copyrights in order to obtain a share of the songwriting royalties, a common practice among record company owners. Syd Nathan, Sydney Nathan, and Lois Mann are credited with writing 202 songs, including \\"Annie Had a Baby\\", \\"I'll Sail My Ship Alone\\", \\"Signed Sealed and Delivered\\", and \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\". Nathan had long-standing health issues, and heart problems began to emerge during his fifties. He died of heart disease, complicated by pneumonia, in Miami, Florida, in 1968 at the age of 63. He was buried at the Judah Touro Cemetery, in Cincinnati. Legacy Nathan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Bluegrass Hall of Fame in 2007. In the James Brown biopic Get on Up, Nathan is portrayed by the actor Fred Melamed.

History Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Drawing of the Tuskulƒónai Manor in 1848 In the area on the right bank of the Neris River opposite the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Antakalnis, the Royal Manor, so called Derevnictva (Polish: Derewnictwo), was established in the middle 16th century by the King Sigismund Augustus in order to supply vegetables and meat to Vilnius Castles. The manor was held by the kings Sigismund III Vasa and W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, nobleman M. Pieg≈Çowski, the Wo≈Çowicz family, Grand Hetman of Lithuania Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, as well as the Tyzenhaus family (since 1741). The manor was named Tusculanum after a resort area near Rome in the place of the ancient Roman city of Tusculum by Lateran monks, who owned the central part of the manor in the middle 18th century after it was partitioned into the folwarks of Tuskulƒónai (or Tuskulionys), based on the kernel of the old royal manor, and Derevnictva.

In the mid-19th century the main palace was transformed into a guesthouse by prominent doctor and public activist Julian Titius that became a cultural center in Vilnius, often visited by Stanislaw Moniuszko and J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski. Summary of the book Tuskulƒónai: egzekucij≈≥ aukos ir budeliai (1944-1947) by S.

During excavations that took place between 1994 and 1996 in its territory, the remains of 706 bodies were found; 40 were identified. The area had been used to hide the bodies of Lithuanian residents ‚Äì mostly resistance fighters against the Soviet occupation, Nazi collaborators and Armia Krajowa soldiers ‚Äì who had been executed between 1944 and 1947 by the NKGB and MGB in the Vilnius' KGB Palace prison near Luki≈°kƒós Square (now Museum of Genocide Victims). The remains from the mass grave were placed in a columbarium built underground, beneath an artificial hill, and consecrated in 2004. The area surrounding the Tuskulƒónai Manor was referred to as Tuskulionys (; Vilnius City Plan. Year 1904 Vilnius City Plan. Year 1935 ) until World War II.

Much of the mountain, including the summit is included in the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape World Heritage Site, and a labyrinth of coal mines, including Big Pit National Coal Museum lies under the mountain. Geology The hill is formed from a succession of Carboniferous age sandstones and mudstones, notably the Pennant Sandstone, outcrops of which occur in places around the margins of its plateau-like top. The stone has been worked in places for building stone and a number of abandoned small quarries may be seen. The lower slopes of the hill are in the Coal Measures and have been intensively worked for coal with considerable areas of landscaped opencast workings evident along its northeastern side. Coity Mountain is likely to have stood above the ice during the last ice age as, unlike in surrounding valleys, there is no glacial till to be found on its slopes. There are areas of peat and accumulations of head and many small landslips adorn its steeper slopes.British Geological Survey 1:50K geological map sheet 232 'Abergavenny' & explanatory memoir Access A number of public rights of way cross the mountain though none traverse the summit.

The road is also frequently closed in winter due to snowfall or landslides. The Pass is well known for the Ponderosa cafe at its highest point and the scenic views along the road. Both the cafe and the pass itself are extremely popular with cyclists & motorcyclists. There are many walks and routes in the immediate area that are popular with hikers, and there are a number of campsites nearby.

Introduction By the beginning of the 20th century, growing confrontations between the working class and their employers caused suspicion and animosity both within, and against the workers. Striking workers had taken militant action which culminated in the Haymarket Riot in Chicago; the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886 was crushed, destroying the Knights of Labor, coincident with the birth of the conservative American Federation of Labor. In the western United States the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) inherited the mantle of militant unionism, challenging capital in strikes from Cripple Creek to Canada. Many communities sought to limit the spread of union philosophy by revoking rights granted by the United States Constitution, particularly the freedom of speech granted by the First Amendment. Industrial Workers of the World In 1905 the WFM and other unions, together with socialist, and anarchist groups met in Chicago to form the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in what came to be called the \\"First Continental Congress of the working class.\\" The immediate purpose of the IWW was to unite all working people into one worldwide union, regardless of race, creed, sex, skill, or national origin. The ultimate goal was abolition of the wage system, replacing wage labour with worker cooperatives. The Wobblies, as IWW members were called, frequently engaged in creative tactics, including soapboxing. The IWW orators spoke to workers about bosses, corruption, exploitation, and the unfairness of capitalism. Championing such a direct challenge to capital, members of the IWW faced persecution and prejudice in North America, and throughout the world. In many American cities, from Pennsylvania to California, IWW members found their right to public speech interfered with by local ordinance or police harassment. Thus began the free speech fights of the IWW. From approximately 1906, the San Diego General Membership Branch of the IWW focused on various small industries, including cigar making and lumber. In 1910 the IWW attempted to organize Mexican workers of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company. A successful strike led to the formation of a public service union, which was disbanded when many of the Mexican workers left to participate in the Mexican Revolution. Events leading to the fight One of the most brutal and significant of the free speech fights occurred in the Stingaree neighborhood of San Diego, home to the city's \\"undesirables.\\" The San Diego Common Council had passed an ordinance to curb Wobbly soapbox orations, resulting in the San Diego free speech fight in which the IWW clashed with law enforcement and vigilantes who were incited to violence by local newspapers. Germania Hall incident The San Diego free speech fight began on February 1, 1912, but confrontation with the San Diego's \\"old guard\\" began as early as 1910. On November 10, 1910, Local 13 of the IWW held a meeting to celebrate the martyrs of the Chicago Haymarket Riot. The police closed down the Wobbly meeting place, Germania Hall, before the event could take place. In response, the IWW took their grievances to the streets and began their soapbox free speech campaign. Afterwards, Wobblies who spoke \\"on the soapbox\\" were jailed, \\"fingerprinted, photographed in jail and then released.\\"Miller pp.215-16. In response to the Germania Hall incident, the IWW shifted their efforts to a form of soapbox oratory in order to win over a diverse spectrum of the working class, focusing on gaining converts through their speeches. The fifty members of the IWW refocused their efforts to Heller's Corner at the corner of 5th and E Streets, in the center of the Stingaree. The Stingaree contained a m√©lange of ethnic groups: ranging from whites, white immigrant, blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese, most of which were members of the working class. The Stingaree and Heller's Corner were symbolic hubs for the San Diegan prejudices against different races and lower classes. The Stingaree was home to everything different and unknown that went against the \\"mission\\" ideal in San Diego, including: saloons, shops, cheap hotels, gambling houses, opium dens and prostitutes. The square block at the corner of Fifth and E Streets was home to more than just debauchery, as it also was the central location for a variety of \\"soapbox orators\\" including the Salvation Army, Socialists, Holy Rollers, and the Single Taxers. The situation was relatively peaceful and there were no violent run-ins with the police, until after the Germania Hall incident.Miller p.188. Ordinance prohibiting free speech The free speech fight officially began on January 8, 1912, when the San Diego Common Council passed Ordinance No. 4623, which called for a restricted zone of 49-square blocks (more than that which was requested by San Diegans) in the middle of San Diego, encompassing all of \\"soapbox row.\\" The ordinance came as a result of a recommendation given by the San Diego grand jury and a petition signed by eighty-five prominent citizens and property owners who had hoped to prohibit free speech in a seven-square block zone centered around 5th & E. The meetings blocked traffic, it was officially argued, and that necessitated an ordinance for \\"the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety and one of emergency.\\"Miller p.216. The initial punishment for violating the ordinance was punishable by a $25 to $100 fine and/or thirty days' imprisonment. Prior to passage of the ordinance, the Wobblies, Single Taxers, and Socialists had signed a 250-person petition in which they called for an allowance of unrestricted free speech. This effort countered the petitions previously submitted by the San Diego Grand Jury and the high powered San Diegan citizens, but to no avail. There was a period of uncertainty, during which the council delayed its decision. The council may have simply been searching for affirmation from the general public in order to avoid widespread conflict and dismay throughout the city. Some council members \\"believed that a referendum would show that the majority of San Diegans favored speaking anywhere at anytime.\\"Miller p.218. The council finally found a reason to pass the ordinance on the evening of January 6, 1912. The Socialists and Single Taxers were holding a soapbox event on the streets when an off-duty constable and real estate man, R.J. Walsh drove his car into a crowd at the closed-off soapbox row. With his horn blaring, he attempted to disrupt the orators.See Bill Haywood's letter of April 9, 1913, to The New York Times, available online at NYT archive. His car was mobbed and its tires were slashed. The police intervened and two days later the San Diego Common Council passed Ordinance 4623 with an emergency clause that called for the immediate cessation of public free speech rights, sidestepping the customary twenty-day implementation wait period. The free speech fight had officially begun. Opposition to the ordinance The California Free Speech League was created on January 16, 1912, with the support of Socialists, Wobblies, church groups, the AFL and other trade unions. The League attempted to take a legal stand against the free speech restrictions by holding up the Constitution and defending the rights of non-property owning peoples. The League also hired E.E. Kirk as an attorney to provide some legal leverage against the law and its enforcement. After the passage of free speech restrictions, the Wobblies and other groups began testing the ordinance. At a typical IWW street meeting the police left the Wobblies undisturbed and merely relegated themselves to traffic and pedestrian direction. Indeed, the Wobblies and the Socialists believed that they had already won back their free speech rights. But law enforcement was simply adhering to a generally accepted 30-day grace period after the ordinance was enacted. Once the grace period was over, forty-one people were arrested during a parade and demonstration consisting of 5,000 protesters. Those arrested were jailed for twenty-four hours, held initially on a misdemeanor charge. But the prosecutors decided the violators had conspired to break the law, and thus tried the prisoners under a felony charge of conspiracy. The Wobblies and other soapbox speakers then moved their orations out of the restricted zone. But the council passed an ordinance which gave police the ability to arrest anyone that disrupted traffic throughout San Diego. Jail conditions and civil disobedience The increase in arrests led to the rapid filling of the San Diego jails, causing overcrowding and the rapid decline of prison conditions, increasing Wobbly anger toward law enforcement. The reports about jail conditions were conflicting, but the general trend seems to show that the Wobblies and other pro-free speech detainees were treated badly. The jails filled up so quickly that the police used their sobering rooms or drunk tanks for housing inmates. These tanks had no beds and the arrested were forced to sleep on vermin infested concrete floors. Moreover, police brutality and aggression were rampant, while beatings and other abuses were relatively common throughout the ordeal. Sixty-three- year-old Michael Hoy died on March 28 after the police beat him and withheld medical attention. These events coincided with the plan of the Free Speech League to \\"glut the jails and then to demand individual jury trials which would clog the courts and bring the legal machinery to a standstill.\\"Shanks 29. This especially appealed to the IWW, so much so that they called for 20,000 Wobblies to converge on San Diego in order to bring the system to a halt. There were 50 members of local 13 in 1912, but roughly 5,000 Wobblies came to San Diego to participate in the free speech fight. District Attorney Utley tried to offer a compromise to the Wobblies, promising to free the men originally arrested for conspiracy if the IWW ceased its public speaking in the restricted zone. The IWW declined the offer on principle even through its attorney, E.E. Kirk, recommended that they accept the compromise. The arrests continued. The IWW then protested against the detainment and the prison conditions in front of the city jail. Five thousand protesters turned out, and the police indiscriminately blasted people, including women and children, with fire hoses. Vigilantes The increase in arrests left Police Chief Keno Wilson with a dilemma; he wanted to punish the protesters, but simultaneously faced overcrowded jails and stockades. After local newspapers began editorializing vociferously against the protesters and their tactics, groups of vigilantes began transporting arrested Wobblies and free speakers to the county line. The vigilantes began patrolling trains that were inbound from the north, and would grab Wobblies and invited speakers before they could get to the city. The vigilantes then proceeded to \\"reeducate\\" the speakers on patriotism as this brutal first hand account notes: > They were drunk and hollering and cursing the rest of the night. In the > morning they took us out four or five at a time and marched us up the track > to the county line ... where were forced to kiss the flag and then run a > gauntlet of 106 men, every one of which was striking at us as hard as they > could with their pick ax handles. They broke one man's leg, and everyone was > beaten black and blue, and was bleeding from a dozen wounds.Miller 225. These incidents occurred quite frequently, but there was no significant outcry from the middle class citizens of San Diego. The state of California finally intervened, as Governor Hiram Johnson was flooded with demands for an inquiry into the arrests and vigilantism in San Diego. Governor Johnson sent Colonel Weinstock to act as an investigative commissioner. By all accounts Weinstock was an impartial judge of situation, and he concluded that the arrests and free speech restrictions were unlawful, but that the Wobblies were wrong in their pursuance of an activist stance. Moreover, Weinstock likened the situation to Czarist Russia and suggested the Attorney General take action, but he did not. Although Weinstock's presence caused a temporary cessation in violence, the situation was once again aroused when Joseph Mikolash, a Wobbly, was killed by police in the IWW headquarters in San Diego on May 7. The Wobblies reportedly employed firearms against the police in the incident, which led to the discovery of a small arms cache in the IWW headquarters. This increased the public's hostility toward the IWW and toward Weinstock's report, which had defended the Wobblies' constitutional right to free speech. Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman came to San Diego for Goldman to give her speech \\"An Enemy of the People\\" on May 15, 1912. When the two arrived at the train station the same women that allegedly needed protection from the soapbox orators yelled \\"Give us that anarchist; we will strip her naked; we will tear out her guts.\\"Miller 194. Mayor of San Diego James E. Wadham offered a warning, but no help to the two activists. Reitman was abducted by vigilantes from his hotel room and tortured. He later recalled, > They tore my clothes off. They knocked me down, and when I lay naked on the > ground, they kicked and beat me until I was almost insensible. With a > lighted cigar they burned the letters I.W.W. on my buttocks; then they > poured a can of tar over my head and, in the absence of feathers, rubbed > sage-brush on my body. One of them attempted to push a cane into my rectum. > Another twisted my testicles. They forced me to kiss the flag and sing The > Star-Spangled Banner. When they tired of the fun, they gave me my underwear > for fear we should meet any women. They also gave me back my vest, in order > that I might carry my money, railroad ticket, and watch. The rest of my > clothes they kept. I was ordered to make a speech, and then they commanded > me to run the gauntlet. The Vigilantes lined up, and as I ran past them, > each one gave me a blow or a kick. Then they let me go.Reitman, as quoted by > Emma Goldman, Living My Life, v.1, pp. 494-501. Reitman had not been a member of the IWW, although he was a supporter. Emma Goldman then returned to Los Angeles after being misled into thinking that the Vigilantes had not harmed Reitman but simply put him on a train for Los Angeles. Reitman was released a day later and arrived in Los Angeles badly beaten. By the fall of 1912, the soapbox row had been abandoned. The vigilantes ended their terror campaign, for they had brutalized, driven out, or‚Äì some believe‚Äì possibly murdered anyone who stood up for the right of free speech in San Diego. This was quite a different result from what the IWW had experienced in its other free speech fights around the country. The Wobblies did not return to San Diego until 1914. In song From the July 11, 1912, edition of the IWW's Little Red Songbook, the first stanza of \\"We're Bound For San Diego\\": :In that town called San Diego when the workers try to talk, :The cops will smash them with a sap and tell them \\"take a walk\\", :They throw them in a bull pen and they feed them rotten beans, :And they call that \\"law and order\\" in that city, so it seems.A recording of the song is available online at \\"History in Song\\" , by Manfred Helfert. The bonus track \\"Tar and Sagebrush\\", from Anti-Flag's new album, The Bright Lights of America, is a folk punk interpretation of Ben Reitman's description of his torture.

It was the first album to be credited to Ian Dury & the Blockheads rather than Ian Dury alone, although Dury had used the full band name for the \\"What a Waste\\" 7\\" single of 1978. The album was released in the wake of the chart-topping hit single \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\", and reached number two in the charts, behind ABBA's Voulez-Vous. Do It Yourself sold around 200,000 copies, and was Dury's second Platinum album (after its predecessor New Boots and Panties!!). Background and recording Like New Boots and Panties!! before it, much of Do It Yourself was written at Dury's home, no longer a flat near the Oval cricket ground, but now a rented home in Rolvenden, Kent. Even though he declined point blank his management's attempts to get him to dust off and re- record old Kilburn & the High Roads songs like \\"England's Glory\\" Dury did resurrect one old song, \\"Sink My Boats\\", the very first song he and Chaz Jankel wrote together. In fact, a number of other songs pre-date the rehearsal and songwriting sessions for Do It Yourself; the instrumentals for \\"Quiet\\", \\"This Is What We Find\\" and \\"Uneasy Sunny Day Hotsy Totsy\\" were all arranged by Blockheads members while they were still in their band Loving Awareness. The recording session at Dury's house that also produced \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\" was used to demo some of the new songs. These demos, later released on Edsel Record's 2-CD re-issue of the album, were for \\"This Is What We Find\\", \\"Inbetweenies\\", \\"Quiet\\" and \\"Uneasy Sunny Day Hotsy Totsy\\", along with the first version of \\"Duff 'Em Up and Do 'Em Over (Boogie Woogie)\\", a song that would remain unreleased but would eventually become the song \\"Oh Mr. Peanut\\" on the next album, Laughter. Do It Yourself was recorded in The Workhouse Studios on the Old Kent Road, the same place where New Boots and Panties!! had been recorded two years earlier, under the production of Jankel and Latham, though Latham's credit was as 'recording engineer'. In keeping with Dury's policy of not including singles on albums, \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\" was omitted, and no singles were released from the album either (his next British single would be \\"Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3\\"). Most retrospective interviews with band and management bemoan this. and nearly all suggest the opening track \\"Inbetweenies\\" as the ideal choice of single; \\"Inbetweenies\\" was released in Europe, backed with \\"Dance of the Screamers\\". The lack of singles on the album did not greatly affect its chart performance. Packaging Do It Yourself was released on 18 May 1979 with an unusually large publicity drive; in addition to widespread print advertising in the music press, Stiff Records released the album with at least 34 known alternative sleeves, each one featuring a different Crown Wallpaper design. Each sleeve has the Crown catalogue number for the particular wallpaper design in the bottom left hand corner. Crown also wallpapered all of the sets for the Blockheads' subsequent promotional tour. The numerous sleeves greatly helped sales, and there were reports of ‚Äòcompletist‚Äô fans travelling to different towns and even importing more sleeves that were only released abroad. In addition, Stiff commissioned a wide variety of promotional merchandise, with various badges, combs, watches, paint brushes, paints pots, bags, clocks and wallpaper distributed. The sleeve and all the promotional material were the creations of graphic designer Barney Bubbles, who also created the Blockheads' 'clockface' logo. A number of the promotional items designed by Bubbles can be seen in the booklet for Ian Dury & the Blockheads' final album Ten More Turnips from the Tip.

Previously it had been reissued by Demon Records, once without bonus tracks, then again by Repertoire with \\"Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick\\", \\"There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards\\", \\"Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3\\", \\"Common As Muck\\", \\"I Want To Be Straight\\", \\"That's Not All\\" (the A and B sides of the three singles released around the time of Do It Yourself and the 12\\" extended mix of \\"Reasons To Be Cheerful\\" as bonus tracks. Edsel changed the bonus tracks, removing \\"I Want To Be Straight\\" and its B-side \\"That's Not All\\" and replacing them with \\"What A Waste\\". This is, in fact, a more fitting set of bonus tracks, as \\"I Want To Be Straight\\" was released nearly a year after Do It Yourself and features a different Blockheads line-up (including Dr. Feelgood's Wilko Johnson), the same line-up that plays on the album Laughter (Edsel's re-issue of Laughter includes both tracks), whereas \\"What A Waste\\" was played by the original Blockheads line-up that plays on Do It Yourself. Edsel's current re-issue also features a bonus disc that includes the demos recorded at Dury's house in Kent and 10 tracks recorded on the Stiff's Live Stiff's tour in 1977. These songs are different from the three included on the LP of the tour released the previous year.

It can reach over 25 meters in height, and it is not uncommon for climbing trees to be planted nearby to make harvesting the fruit and leaves both easier and safer. Indigenous people use the fibers of young leaves to weave into products such as nets, hammocks, bags, and other fabric and textile products. In most places where this fiber is used, the sale of products woven from these fibers to tourists is a major source of income, though there is great geographic variation in abundance and income received for products made from these fibers. In addition to the fibers, it is believed that the fruit and liquid endosperm within the seeds can help with fever reduction.

He was also an expert in its casting and manufacture. Biography Driver began his career as a draughtsman in the office of Frank Foster, Engineer to the Commissioners of Sewers, in London. In 1852, he was employed by Liddell and Gordon as a draughtsman, and he completed designs for bridges and stations for the Midland Railway on their Leicester and Hitchin Railway. His original case of drawing tools with a monogrammed lid 'ChD 1855' has been passed down through the family. Starting in 1857, he worked under Robert Jacomb-Hood in the Engineer's Office of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway including work on designs for their London Bridge terminus. In 1866, he created designs for the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line stations. In 1867, he designed for Box Hill & Westhumble railway station on the new Leatherhead to Dorking line. In 1862, he designed the Slade drinking fountain in Kennington Park for Felix Sladehttps://www.kenningtonpark.org/park-monuments. In 1863, he submitted designs for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork and although his design was admired, he lost out to William Burges. After 1864, he assisted civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette with designs for the landing stages and masonry of the Thames Embankment including work on the dolphin lamp standard, and for the pumping stations at Abbey Mills and Crossness. These innovative facilities reduced diseases, such as deadly cholera epidemics, by moving raw sewage and polluted effluent downstream of London for discharge into the Thames. In 1869, he began work for the Crystal Palace company designing and building the Aquarium, Orangery, and repairing the Water Towers. He also pioneered the use of ornamental tile work in industrial interiors. Based on the success of the Crystal Palace Aquarium, Driver won a contract in 1872 with the Council of the Vienna Exhibition to design a permanent aquarium in Vienna. In 1872, Driver completed the Horton Infirmary at Banbury in Oxfordshire. Beginning in 1873, he worked with Sir James Brunlees and Alexander McKerrow on designs for King's Lynn Bridge, Clifton and other stations. He was also the architect for the piers at Llandudno, Nice, and Southend-on-Sea Obituary, The Builder v.79, 10 Nov 1900, p. 423-4 Starting in 1882, he assisted Sir Douglas Fox and Francis Fox with designs for Preston Fishergate Hill railway station and for Southport railway station and others on the Cheshire lines extension. From 1888, he worked with Edward Woods in preparing designs for Mercado Central de Santiago, and for stations on the Buenos Aires and Ensenada Port Railway. From 1894 to 1895, he was on the design teams for stations on the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway. Luz Station, S√£o Paulo, Brazil He designed the West Pier Pavilion at Brighton, and was the architect for the stations (including the \\"Station of Light\\" in S√£o Paulo, Brazil) on the S√£o Paulo Railway.Soukef Jnr, A. 2000. Cem Anos Luz, Luz Station. Dialeto, Sao Paulo He was also responsible for Dorking Town Hall, Dorking Waterworks, Dorking Union, and many shops and residences in Dorking; Banbury Hospital; the late Sir Tatton Sykes and Ellesmere Memorials ; and the Mark Masons‚Äô Hall in Great Queen Street . He also enjoyed painting oils and water colours, some of which survive today. He died on 27 October 1900 and is buried in West Norwood Cemetery. He left an estate of about one million pounds, a massive sum for the year 1900. References * Paul Dobraszczyk, writing in the Architectural History journal, 2006.

He is known only by his works. *In 1109 he compiled an ecclesiastical history in four volumes, up to the death of Charles the Great (814). In the following year he made another edition of the work in six volumes, arranging the contents in a better manner, adding notes, especially of a theological nature, and omitting a few things, bringing it up to 855. It appeared in print for the first time at M√ºnster, in 1638, edited by Bernhard Rottendorf. This contains also a letter to Ivo of Chartres and a preface to King Louis the Fat. Selections can be found in Migne, Patrologia Latina, CLXIII. This work relied on an abbreviated chronicle of the kings of France (Historia Francorum Senonensis, 688‚Äì1034). *A chronicle of the kings of France (Historia regum francorum monasterii Sancti Dionysii) from Pharamond, the legendary first king, to the death of Philip I of France in 1108 (MGH SS 9, 395-406). *A book narrating the \\"modern acts of the Frankish kings\\" (Modernorum regum francorum actus), covering time from 842 to 1108 (MGH SS 9, 376-395).

He served in the Virginia Senate, the 23rd United States Congress, and for 25 years as judge and President of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. He supported Virginia's secession during the American Civil War, and all his surviving sons joined the Confederate States Army, the two youngest dying in the conflict. Early and family life Allen was born at Woodstock, Shenandoah County, Virginia to lawyer James Allen (1762-1844) and his wife, the former Jane Steele (1758-1826), daughter of Rev. John Steele (1715-1779; the \\"Fighting Parson\\" of Carlisle, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania). His father would represent Shenandoah county in the Virginia House of Delegates as well as become the local circuit court judge. John J. Allen studied at Washington College in Lexington, Virginia and at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, then read law with his father.Dorothy Davis, History of Harrison County West Virginia (American Association of University Women, 1970, corrected 1972) p. 159 He married Mary Elizabeth Payne Jackson (daughter of John George and Mary Payne Jackson) on November 11, 1824. Their children included Mary J. Allen Watts (1825-1855), Jane S. Arthur (1831- ), John J. Allen Jr. (1831-1898), Eveline S. Allen Wood (1833-1909), Robert Edwin Allen (1836-1883), Henry Clay Allen (1838-1889), James Madison Allen (1840-1959), George Jackson Allen (1843-1862), and Baldwin Allen (1845-1862).1850 U.S. Federal Census for District 8, Botetourt County,Virginia family 1457 Career Allen was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1818, and opened his first office at Campbell Courthouse, Virginia in 1819. He soon moved to Clarksburg, the seat of Harrison County where he practiced law in the surrounding counties for seventeen years, after 1830 (until his election as judge) in partnership with Gideon D. Camden, who also later became a circuit judge. In 1828, voters from the trans-Appalachian counties of Kanawha, Logan, Mason, Cabell, Randolph, Harris, Lewis and Wood elected Allen to represent them in the Virginia Senate. However, he did not serve a full four year term, because the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 led to a reorganization of districts. His growing district was split, and William McComas came to represent Kanawha, Mason, Cabell, Logan and Nicholas Counties, and John McWhorter representing Harrison, Lewis and Wood Counties (although both members continued to serve on a part-time basis). In 1832, Allen successfully ran for election to the U.S. Congress, and was a member of the 23rd United States Congress, serving for a year from March 4, 1833 to March 4, 1835. In the 1834 election, voters in Harrison, Lewis and Preston counties elected Allen as their Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney (state prosecutor). He served for about a year before Virginia's General Assembly elected him as Judge for the seventeenth Circuit in 1836. Allen then moved to Botetourt County where he held his first court. In December 1840, the Virginia General Assembly elected Judge Allen to the Supreme Court of Appeals. In 1851 his fellow judges elected him as the court's President during another reorganization. Prelude and American Civil War After Abraham Lincoln's election in November 1860, Judge Allen called a mass meeting in Botetourt County on December 10, 1860. He presented a resolution that he had drafted extolling Virginia's contributions to the nation's founding and condemning the north for \\"pharisaical fanaticism\\" concerning slavery and urged calling a convention to consider secession. The meeting overwhelmingly approved his document (except for 2 unnamed dissenters), which came to be called the \\"Botetourt Resolutions.\\"http://www.civilwarcauses.org/botet.htm Allen's sons (and his eldest daughter's widower husband) volunteered for Confederate army service. While the three eldest Allen boys and their brother in law William Watts survived the conflict (and Henry Clay Allen survived the Battle of Gettysburg), the year 1862 proved disastrous for the family. Capt. John J. Allen St. lost an arm as a result of a wound sustained at the Battle of Malvern Hill, Master sergeant George Jackson Allen died in the Seven Days' Battle and Private Baldwin Allen died of typhoid fever after his artillery unit was assigned to Tennessee. Death and legacy Allen resigned from the Court in April 1865 and retired to private life at his home,Beaverdam, near Fincastle, the Botetourt County seat. He was buried at Lauderdale cemetery in Botetourt County after dying in 1871. Nearly three years later, his eldest son, James J. Allen Jr., won election as Botetourt County's delegate. Though he served but a single term, his middle brother Henry Clay Allen began the first of his four terms representing the family's ancestral Shenandoah County in 1875. John James Allen would then follow his father's path and become a circuit judge in Botetourt County for the rest of his career, and H.C. Allen would become the body's speaker in 1877-1879 before becoming a judge in Shenandoah county.Leonard pp. xv, 517, 523, 525, 527, 567 References ¬∑ Category:1797 births Category:1871 deaths Category:People from Woodstock, Virginia Category:Jackson family of West Virginia Category:National Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia Category:Virginia state senators Category:Justices of the Virginia Supreme Court Category:County and city Commonwealth's Attorneys in Virginia Category:Virginia circuit court judges Category:People from Botetourt County, Virginia Category:People from Campbell County, Virginia Category:People from Harrison County, West Virginia Category:Politicians from Clarksburg, West Virginia Category:Virginia lawyers Category:West Virginia lawyers Category:19th-century American lawyers Category:Dickinson College alumni Category:Washington and Lee University alumni ","title":"John J.

The tunnel would provide relief to an area that experiences severe flooding events which cause tens of millions in property damage and disruption to lives. The tunnel would stretch from the Wayne, New Jersey area to Newark Bay, a distance of approximately twenty miles. The course, watershed, and tributaries of the Passaic and area of prehistoric Lake Passaic, where flooding occurs regularly Origin of tunnel The Passaic River Flood Tunnel idea has its origins in the federally appointed Flood District Commission that existed from 1902 through 1936, and was assigned the task of formulating plans to alleviate persistent flooding in the Passaic River Basin. Proposed tunnel plan After several failed proposals over the decades, the modern vision of the Passaic River Flood Tunnel took shape in the mid 1980s as the State of New Jersey selected a modified Army Corps of Engineers preferred alternative: The Pompton/Passaic Dual Inlet Tunnel Diversion Plan. The major elements of the proposed project were a , tunnel and a , spur tunnel, two inlets, one outlet, at least four workshafts along the tunnel pathway, \\"natural\\" storage areas, channel modifications, ponding areas, levees, and flood walls. The outlet of the tunnel would be located in Newark Bay, 1,500 feet south of Kearny Point. The main tunnel would carry flood waters from the primary inlet at the confluence of the Pequannock, Wanaque, Ramapo, and Pompton Rivers just above the junction with the Passaic River; an area that is most prone to severe flooding in the Passaic River basin. A spur would carry floodwaters from an inlet along the Passaic River, downstream from Two Bridges, to a connection with the main tunnel beneath the borough of Totowa, New Jersey. A Floodwarning and Forecasting System would be pressed into service to establish operating signals for the tunnel. Most of the major channel modifications would be built near the two tunnel inlets. The modifications would modify several portions of the Passaic, Pompton, Ramapo, Wanaque, and Pequannock Rivers. There are also two interim projects that would be constructed prior to the construction of the flood tunnel. These two projects include major stream alterations, including channelization to the Saddle River and Ramapo River. The cost estimate for the tunnel in the late 1990s was $1.8 billion. Current status The State and Federal governments prefer to buy out properties in the Passaic River Basin that are prone to flooding, rather than embarking on a large-scale engineering and construction project such as the proposed flood-control.

When blooms the cheek with roseate, varying dyes; When modest grace exerts each power to please, And Streaming lustre radiates in the eyes. Thy past hours innocent, thy present gay, Thy future, halcyon Hope depicts without allay. Day spring of life! oh, stay thy fleeting hours! Thou fairy reign of ev'ry pleasant thought! Fancy, to cheer thy path, strews all her flowers, And in her loom thy plan of years is wrought. By thee for goodness each heart caress'd. The world, untried, judg'd by that within thy breast. Sweet state of Youth ! O harmony of foul! Now chearful dawns the day, noon brightly beams, And evening comes serene, nor cares controul, And night approaches with soft infant dreams Circling, the morn beholds th' accustom'd round, Life's smiling charities awake and joys abound. published in The Scots Magazine - Sunday 01 September 1799.

It is located 30 km from Campinas and 72 km from S√£o Paulo. With 0.76 km2, is considered the second largest amusement park in Brazil, and is part of the tourist complex SerrAzul Full Life. Hopi Hari is a fictitious country - its employees are residents (h√≥pius) - with a \\"president\\", capital, national language, among other features.

Originally, the park was to be called \\"Playcenter Great Adventure\\", as its name shows, it belonged to the Playcenter group, but due to the crisis that Brazil was in the 1990s, it was forced to sell it while still under construction, as a consequence of the reduction in visitors at Playcenter. The company GP Investments took over the works, where the park project has undergone several changes, including a name change to \\"Hopi Hari\\". Warner Bros agreement Recently, Warner Bros. Consumer Products (WBCP) and Hopi Hari, has struck a licensing agreement to bring some of the biggest franchises in the world. So far we know that the characters of the Justice League, Looney Tunes and Penelope Pitstop will be added to the attractions of the park.Warner Bros.

Characters like Tweety, Sylvester, Superman, Batman, Bugs Bunny, Aquaman, Taz, The Flash, will be in areas Infantasia (Looney Tunes characters and Penelope) and Aribabiba (the Justice League characters). What was talk in the heat of this news release was really these characters of American popular culture, \\"fit\\" in the history of Hopi Hari. The characters of Sesame Street, which now leave the scene, as were almost attached since the inauguration of the park because they had a history as strong as those of Superman and Batman, for example, that was known and was read in the park site on the history of Infantasia was that the population of children of settlers from Hopi Hari had grown and needed an area just for them. Along with the staff of Sesame Street, founded Infantasia, or were incorporated into the story of \\"country\\" sneak. Not now. Some of the most famous characters in the world, will fall by parachute in the park. However, the park is officially pronounced as telling stories of the merger will be so different. \\"[...] The entry of the Looney Tunes will be based on a new design in which Bugs Bunny is a millionaire with his inventions and goes to live in a house with Daffy Duck.

Aribabiba is in this battle will happen at each attraction. \\" Tourist and Economic importance While being close to large urban centres like S√£o Paulo and Campinas, the park has an important role for the economy and tourism in the state of S√£o Paulo and Brazil. The park is part of the complex SerrAzul Full Life which also includes Wet 'n Wild water park, Shopping SerrAzul, the Premium Outlet shopping center, the Quality Resort Hotel and Itupeva SerraAzul Farm subdivision. This complex attracts more than 5 million Brazilian tourists all year (number equal to the amount of foreign tourists to Brazil received in 2008) surpassing even tourist spots known as Christ the Redeemer, one of the Seven Wonders the modern world, and the Sugar Loaf in Rio de Janeiro, which together received only 1.9 million tourists (Brazilian and foreign) in 2008, according to RioTur. The Hopi Hari is responsible for 40% of the total of 5 million tourists - 2 million visitors are welcomed every year by the park. The park hopes to double that amount within 10 years, since hopes to attract more tourists in agreement with the Warner Bros. In 2010, Hopi Hari had a gross revenue of R $103 million, meaning an increase of 25% compared to 2009. Hopi Hari had the biggest increase among parks reporting in previous years, with close to 500,000 additional visitors, driven by a combination of the opening of several major new rides, and very strong economic growth in Brazil.

For food, one can travel to the numerous sandwich shops located throughout the park. For a more interesting eating experience, there are several small restaurants in the park, generally with a different food theme, such as the English Pub. Hop√™s (Hoplish - Hopi Hari's language) As an imaginary country, Hopi Hari has also its own language, called hop√™s (\\"Hoplish\\"). It is a humorous, often childish language mostly based on Portuguese with lexical influence from other languages, chiefly Papiamento, Boror√≥, Portuguese, English, Italian and German. Signs throughout the park are printed in both hop√™s and Portuguese and there are several places in the park where one can buy the Michaelis \\"Hoplish- Portuguese Dictionary\\" (Dicion√°rio Hop√™s- Portugu√™s).http://disfrutihari.blogspot.com/p/dicionario-hopes.html Some examples of expressions in the language include: * Tchau√≠ ‚Äì \\"goodbye\\" (from tchau) * Danki ‚Äì \\"thank you\\" * Oi√™ ‚Äì \\"hey, hello\\" (from oi) * Kuanto ki tikitaki? ‚Äì \\"what time is it?\\" (from quanto que + tick tack) * Vendinovu ‚Äì \\"come again\\" (from vem de novo) * Click click ‚Äì \\"picture; photograph\\" (onomatopoeic) * Mi k√© hang√°! ‚Äì \\"I'm hungry\\" * Bon bini ‚Äì \\"welcome\\" * Tivi la ‚Äì \\"I've been there\\" (from estive l√°) Controversies On 28 September 2007, Arthur Wolf, a 15-year-old student, suffered anaphylaxis attack while in one of the Hora do Horror' tunnels. Despite being revived after a CRA by the medical team of the park, he died hours later in the hospital. On 24 February 2012, 14-year-old Gabriella Nichimura died after falling off one of the chairs of the La Tour Eiffel. The girl fell from a height of 20 meters because she was in a seat which couldn't be utilized and was inactive for many years. Overall, eleven people, including the president of the park were indicted by the Civil Police of S√£o Paulo by culpable homicide. The park was closed for 23 days by the Brazilian Public Ministry for investigations and had to make improvements on the safety of all rides and to reduce the working hours of the employees. On the afternoon of 24 September 2014, a group of about 50 youngsters, who paid for their tickets, started a flash rob in the interior of the park, causing havoc and leaving six visitors hurt. Dozens of reports of people having their belongings stolen were left on the park's visitor answering service.

A Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad (TP&W;) train bound for Niagara Falls crossed over a trestle, weakened earlier in the day by a fire, causing it to collapse. In 2007, staff of the McLean County Museum of History wrote that \\"the Chatsworth Train Wreck probably ranks as the second- or third- deadliest U.S rail accident in the 19th century.\\"  Crash  A Harper's Weekly impression of the accident The summer of 1887 had been hot and dry. Fearing that sparks from the steam engines of the trains could ignite brush fires, the TP&W; company began performing controlled burns to prevent an uncontrollable brush fire. On the day of the accident, TP&W; crews performed a controlled burn near the site of the accident‚Äîit is suspected that failure to extinguish the fire resulted in charring of the bridge. That day, a TP&W; train carried vacationers taking advantage of a special offer to visit Niagara Falls. It had picked up passengers all along the TP&W; line as far back as Iowa, and left Peoria, Illinois around 8 p.m.: Two steam engines pulled six fully-loaded wooden passenger cars, six sleeper cars, and three luggage cars. It travelled east through Eureka and Chenoa, and did not stop at Chatsworth. Just before the accident site, the coach accelerated down a slope, reaching . The first engine successfully crossed the weakened bridge as it collapsed; the second engine crashed into the side of the hill, while each following passenger car telescoped into the next. Sleeper cars attached to the rear of the train halted just short of the bridge. The disaster immediately made national news, including almost half of the front page of The New York Times. Four days later, the TP&W; gathered together the remaining wreckage and set it on fire. The crash resulted in the increased use of steel in passenger cars.

The school is located in the Calallen Independent School District in northwest Corpus Christi, Texas, United States. The school is also known for its high athletic success in football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, and the Pride of Calallen Wildcat Band. Background Calallen's name comes from Calvin Joseph (Cal) Allen (1859‚Äì1922), a prominent early rancher. Allen owned a cattle ranch on which the Calallen Independent School District is now located. Allen donated land to the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Rail Line as right-of- way; in exchange, the railroad agreed to place a depot on Allen's property. Allen then subdivided the land adjacent to the depot and established a townsite there. The town was named Calvin until it was discovered that another community in Texas already had that name. Founded in 1910, Calallen was annexed by the city of Corpus Christi in 1970. Athletics In football, Calallen High School has played in the state semifinals twelve times and in the state finals two times. 2005 - Lost to Hebron High School 28-0. 2016 - Lost to Aledo High School 24-16.

The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley was part of the National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted. The school has occupied several structures in its history, including a small cottage on the Coonley Estate in Riverside, Illinois, and another building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It moved to Downers Grove in 1916 and became the Avery Coonley School in 1929, with a new campus designed in the Prairie and Arts and Crafts styles, landscaped by Jens Jensen, who was known as \\"dean of the world's landscape architects\\". The campus has been expanded several times since the 1980s to create more space for arts, technology, and classrooms. Avery Coonley was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, citing the \\"long-lasting influence on schools throughout the country\\" of the educational program and the design of the building and grounds. The progressive legacy is still evident in the modern curriculum, which retains many traditions and educational activities dating back to the beginning of the school. Students work a minimum of one year above their current grade level, and explore broad themes allowing them to learn across subjects and engage in creative and collaborative projects, using instructional technology extensively. Opportunities to build on classroom studies are offered through a range of extracurricular activities. Admission is competitive and an IQ score of at least 124 is required. ACS is notable for its record of success in academic competitions at the state and national levels in mathematics, science, geography, and other subjects. ACS was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education in 1988. Avery Coonley attracted national media attention in 1994 when the school was banned from competition in the Illinois State Science Fair after winning for the fourth year in a row. Although the decision was later reversed, the controversy was decried by the press as an example of the \\"dumbing down\\" of education and the victory of self-esteem over excellence in schools.  History   Founding and Cottage School (1906‚Äì1916)  Charles Whittlesey in 1894, it later became a private residence. In 1906, Queene Ferry Coonley, wife of wealthy Riverside industrialist and publisher Avery Coonley, decided to start a kindergarten program to allow children younger than five years old to attend. Queene Coonley was trained as a social worker and kindergarten teacher at the Detroit Normal School (now Wayne State University) and was impressed by the theories of Friedrich Fr√∂bel, who believed children's early education should be an extension of their lives at home. Fr√∂bel's theories captured the three main principles of what John Dewey would later call the \\"kindergarten attitude\\", which applied not just to kindergartners but to children of all ages. Dewey wrote that the primary role of the school is to train children in cooperative living, the root of all learning is the activity of the child and not external material, and directing children's spontaneous impulses towards maintaining the collective life of the school is how they become prepared for adult life. Convinced of these principles, Coonley sought to enroll her four-year-old daughter in the Riverside School, one of the few public kindergartens in the area, but was disappointed when the child was not eligible because she had not yet turned five. Coonley persuaded the director of the Riverside program, Lucia Burton Morse, and her assistant, Charlotte Krum, to help launch a new school. Morse and Krum had attended Elizabeth Harrison's Kindergarten College, which \\"championed the concept of kindergarten teaching in America and was one of the first teacher's colleges in the country to offer a four-year program culminating in the bachelor of education degree\\". There they had studied the educational theories of John Dewey and others, who stood opposed to the more traditional pedagogical practices of the day, which saw education as the business of transmitting long-standing bodies of information to new generations and inculcating moral training based on rules and standards of conduct.Dewey 1998, p. 17. Their new progressive views of education emphasized an individualized approach to education and an integrated curriculum where children learned from experience and social interaction. According to Dewey, \\"it is a cardinal precept of the newer school of education that the beginning of instruction shall be made with the experience learners already have; that this experience and the capacities that have been developed during its course provide the starting point for all further learning.\\"Dewey 1998, p. 74. These ideas laid the foundations of what would become the \\"progressive movement\\" in education. Coonley, Morse, and Krum brought these ideas with them to the new school, which Coonley described as \\"a Children's Community. Its purpose was not so much to teach what others had thought or grown-ups had done, but for the children themselves to do something.\\" The Coonley Playhouse, with its signature \\"kinder-symphony\\" windows, was built by Frank Lloyd Wright to house the Cottage School in 1912. It has been nominated as a National Historic Landmark. A small cottage on the Coonley estate served as the first school building, reflected by its original name, the Cottage School. The designer was Charles Whittlesey, who had apprenticed under Louis Sullivan. The estate's main building, the Avery Coonley House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is now a National Historic Landmark. Over the years, many of the estate's buildings would be pressed into use as classrooms and residences for teachers. As new grades were added the school grew, and in 1911 Coonley commissioned Wright to design a larger space for the students. The new building was completed in 1912 and became known as the Coonley Playhouse, and featured dozens of brightly colored art glass windows, evoking flags, balloons, and confetti in what Wright referred to as a \\"kinder-symphony\\". \\"Their bright primary colors and lively geometric designs make them some of Wright's most famous windows.\\" Two years of kindergarten were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade with other students their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive schools around the country put new educational ideas into action.Dewey and Dewey 1915, pp. 85‚Äì86, 90‚Äì91, 227. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that: > [T]hey have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in > school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him > and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild > birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where > the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the > work of caring for him.Dewey and Dewey 1915, pp. 90‚Äì91. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: \\"The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem.\\"Dewey and Dewey 1915, p. 227. The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, \\"The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing.\\"Dewey and Dewey 1915, pp. 85‚Äì86.  Junior Elementary School (1916‚Äì1929)  The Junior Elementary School in Downers Grove. The building was demolished in 1944 and the land was sold. It was later donated to create what would become Fishel Park.Portman 2008, p. 78. At the same time the Playhouse was built, Coonley agreed to build a kindergarten in the nearby town of Downers Grove, which did not have a public school. Coonley purchased land on Grove Street and commissioned the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows & Hamilton to design the building. The school, led by Lucia Morse, was launched as the Kindergarten Extension Association School in 1912. In 1916, the Cottage School was closed and a first grade program was launched at the Downers Grove kindergarten, which was renamed the Junior Elementary School. To accommodate older students, a second grade class was added in 1920 for students around seven years old, a third grade in 1926 for eight-year-olds, and a fourth grade for nine-year-old students shortly thereafter.Portman 2008, pp. 11, 17. The Coonleys moved to Washington, D.C. in 1916, and while Queene continued to devote her time and money, she left the day-to-day direction of the school to Morse. Under her direction, the Junior Elementary School built upon the educational foundations established at the Cottage School, with its focus on the active participation of the students. Drama, music, and dance were important parts of the curriculum, and nature study remained an integral component of students' activities. These ideas, and nature study in particular, were largely the creation of Colonel Francis Wayland Parker, whom John Dewey once referred to as \\"the father of progressive education\\". The Junior Elementary School was a proving ground for these principles, which called for a new way of relating to students, allowing them to freely experience their lessons on their own terms. No distinction was made between boys' and girls' activities, which included gardening, carpentry, and cooking. Coonley recalled that \\"[w]e had boys and girls. We made no distinction, boys and girls cooked, boys and girls did carpenter work, boys and girls took an equal part in all matters of government.\\" Students re-enacted history and literature, composed their own music, and spent much of their time outdoors. In 1924, Coonley and Morse helped found a journal entitled Progressive Education, in which they published their own practical experiences at the school, accompanied by articles written by leading educational theorists, including John Dewey.Brown, Finn and Brown 1988, pp. iii‚Äìviii. It became the leading professional journal of the progressive education movement and was published until 1957.  Avery Coonley School (1929‚Äì1960s)  Architectural sketch of The Avery Coonley School campus by Waldron Faulkner. Faulkner would later become one of the principal architects for the campus of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Enrollment continued to grow, and a second building was added to the Junior Elementary School campus in the late 1920s, but still larger facilities were deemed necessary to accommodate future growth and additional grade levels. Coonley chose a wooded tract in Downers Grove, adjacent to the Maple Grove Forest Preserve, as the site for the new building, and her son-in-law, Waldron Faulkner, became the architect of the new building project. Over one hundred students attended school in the opened building on September 30, 1929, and it was renamed The Avery Coonley School, in honor of Coonley's late husband, who had died in 1920. Coonley chose an unusual mascot to represent the ideals of the school. She felt a seahorse was an example of a unique creature who was also a member of a larger community‚Äîan analogy for her vision for Avery Coonley. The seahorse swims upright, from which derives the school motto: \\"Onward and Upward\\",Portman 2008, p. 55. and representations of seahorses are reflected in decorative ironwork and the weather vane on the 1929 building. Progressive education, a pedagogy promoting learning through real-life experiences, was at its zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals,Brown, Finn and Brown 1988, p. 22. and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published a profile of the Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, \\"[v]isitors from all parts of the United States and from foreign countries [came] to see the school‚Äîsometimes as many as thirty in a day.\\"Hartman 1938, p. 137. Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that > the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy > which pervades it ... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and > education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to > all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the > curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending > upon conditions.Hartman 1938, p. xvi. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: > It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of > education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of > society than the education of our generation has produced ... The method in > which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very > nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those > qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human > relations can evolve.Hartman 1938, pp. 144‚Äì145. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education. Morse died in 1940, after 34 years as director, and several years went by without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, formerly the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement took advantage of the NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education‚Äîincluding farming‚Äîand hands- on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade. Queene Ferry Coonley, founder and patron of the Avery Coonley School from 1906 to 1958. She was remembered as an advocate for women's suffrage and progressive education. Coonley died in 1958; ACS had looked to Coonley for her leadership over the years but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined over the years and Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.Portman 2008, p. 38. In 1965, the benefits of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that \\"we don't believe a child should be taught because he or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace.\\" By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become \\"conventional wisdom\\" and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's \\"bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years\\",Follett 2006, p. 39 ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000. Malach also established the Institute for Educational Research (IER) in 1964 as a center for educational experimentation. The Institute, headquartered at ACS, was a joint venture with more than thirty public school districts, which collaborated on research projects and shared in the findings. The large number of schools involved ensured that statistically significant research samples were available and multiple projects could be pursued at one time. In one of the first projects of the Institute, 36 history teachers wrote over 2,000 test questions to help demonstrate that \\"many teachers want assistance in writing better evaluation items based on behavioral objectives\\". Examples of other projects include kindergarten speech programs, elementary science programs, and speed reading in junior high school.  Gifted education (1960s‚Äìpresent)  The kindergarten reading program was the first step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education of the gifted, which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs of gifted children in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which was the first acknowledgment of the characteristics of gifted children and their specific educational needs. The report found that \\"gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs\\".Marland 1972, p. xii. The report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, \\"the stimulation of individual interests ... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks.\\"Marland 1972, p. III-15. The Gatehouse, originally the headmaster's residence, has housed the early childhood program since 1989. In 1960, ACS began screening applicants for high intellectual potential, requiring a tested IQ above 120, achievement test results one and a half grade levels above national norms in reading and math, and intensive in-person evaluations. At the same time, the teachers began adapting the curriculum to meet the goals of a gifted program, allowing even more differentiation for each student, accommodating different learning styles, and incorporating enough flexibility for all students to progress at their own pace. More accelerated classes were added, but the core of the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.Portman 2008, p. 50.  Campus   1929 building  The original 1929 construction, showing the cloister and reflecting pool. The original landscape design was restored in 2006.Follett 2006, p. 11. The campus occupies off of Maple Avenue in Downers Grove. It borders the Maple Grove Forest Preserve, created in 1919, one of the oldest forest preserves in the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County system. The preserve protects \\"the largest remaining remnant of the vast maple forest that became Downers Grove\\", and has been categorized a globally endangered ecosystem. Its black maple and upland sugar maple communities are host to many threatened and endangered plant species, and bloom with trillium, trout lilies, violets, buttercups, and wild geraniums in the spring. The forest is a refuge for a wide range of birds, including Great Horned Owls and several species of hawks, as well as a stopover for several species of migratory birds, including the Indigo Bunting, which nests there during the warm breeding season and migrates south by night in the winter. A hiking trail winds through the preserve, crossing a small creek and passing a nearby pond. The preserve is used by students in their science and nature activities. The designer of the grounds, Jens Jensen,Grese 1992, p. 47. was known as the \\"dean of the world's landscape architects\\", and \\"the father of the Chicago park system\\", for his creation of Humboldt Park, Garfield Park, the Cook County Forest Preserves, and his masterpiece, Columbus Park, in Chicago. Jensen's work became famous for his exclusive use of plants and materials native to the local region, and was characterized by his use of open spaces, flowing water, gently curving lines, and \\"council rings\\", or low circular benches where people can gather. All of these features are evident on the Avery Coonley campus, which makes use of wholly natural settings in lieu of formal gardens.Follett 2006, p. 16. The original landscaping was largely forgotten over the years and poorly maintained. A complete restoration of Jensen's landscape design was completed in 2006 as part of the ACS centennial celebration. The building was designed by Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors to the design of George Washington University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land in the style of the Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style.Follett 2006, p. 18. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II. The building surrounds a courtyard with a large reflecting pool. The classrooms are oriented outward, to provide views of the surrounding forest. There are no interior passages in this part of the building; each class area has an exit to the outside, and students pass between rooms via the covered cloister, even in inclement weather. The design is meant to reinforce the \\"home and school\\" atmosphere that dates back to the Cottage School, with child-sized classrooms, ten working fireplaces, draperies, and other home-like details. Interconnected \\"Learning Spaces\\" in the third grade classroom, designed in 1970 and patented by the school Decorative tiles designed by Henry Chapman Mercer‚Äîone of the leading figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.‚Äîare placed throughout the building.Reed 1987, p. 6. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings.Follett 2006, p. 30. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.Reed 1987, p. 111. In 1970, exploring new designs in school furniture, the Institute for Educational Research worked with the Design Department of Southern Illinois University to create a series of interconnected truncated octahedrons known as \\"learning spaces\\", which resembled an oversized beehive. Each child had his or her own semi-private space with a fold-down seat, reading light, and bookshelf. The goal was to provide private spaces where third grade (eight-year-old) children could develop good study habits, and the school found that the children spent 90 percent of their work time in their learning spaces. The structures were featured in local news stories and in Life magazine. ACS patented the invention and sold models to several local schools. The original structures are still in use in the third grade classroom in 2014. The Avery Coonley School was designated a historical site by the Downers Grove Historical Society in 2006, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, which cited the educational program along with the building and grounds for their \\"unique design and features that have exerted a long-lasting influence on schools throughout the country\\".  Recent additions  Performing Arts Center (PAC), part of the 1993 addition. Drama, music, and other performances are an integral part of the curriculum. A new wing was added in early 1980 to provide additional space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open east side of the courtyard, the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side.Follett 2006, p. 34. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.Follett 2006, p. 15. Increased enrollment in the late 1980s and the need for more space led to another addition in 1992. This addition included a new 17,500-volume library, a 16-station computer lab, and a 236-seat Performing Arts Center (PAC). Moravian tiles around the new foyer fireplace and library doors pay homage to the original building.Follett 2006, p. 35. The PAC \\"is known for its excellent acoustics\\", and hosts student productions and outside artistic groups, including the Beck Institute for the Arts, which stages musical recitals there. Avery Coonley added a full-day kindergarten program in 2005, again requiring more space, and a $4 million, middle school wing was constructed, financed through tax-exempt bonds from the Village of Downers Grove. Its cream and red bricks, hipped roof, deep eaves, and detailed brickwork harmonize with the style of the earlier building. The project added modernized math and science labs, two computer labs, and seven wireless classrooms using tablet computer technology, videoconferencing, and computer controlled overhead projectors.  Curriculum  The founding educational philosophy is still evident in the modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and a focus on the development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.Portman 2008, pp. 45, 52. ACS refers to grade levels as groups, a practice rooted in progressive education that dates back at least to the Junior Elementary School.Portman 2008, p. 79. There are three divisions of students: the early school, which includes the early childhood Program (EC) for three-year-olds and junior kindergarten (JK) for four-year-olds; the lower school for kindergarten through group four, and middle school for groups five through eight. Each class in kindergarten through group eight has 32 students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 in kindergarten, 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in the early childhood program.  Academic program  A second group student collecting sap for maple syrup in the Forest Preserve, the culmination of her study of trees As of 2009, the curriculum is accelerated for each group, which is separated by grade and age; students are instructed a minimum of one year above their current grade level. (For example, the first group is taught at a second grade level.) Students are grouped within their class to allow each of them work at the level of their ability, and they may work several years beyond their current level if they can do so. Students may join older groups to study subjects, which they are exceptionally advanced; however, age groups are usually kept together \\"for social and emotional values\\". All middle school students complete a high school level honors course in mathematics in either algebra or geometry. Students explore broad learning themes at each level that allow them to learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share with the rest of the school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair. Science studies are enhanced by nature and outdoor experiences. Students participate in nature programs sponsored by the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, such as adopting a \\"Bass in the Class\\", and monitoring the growth of macroinvertebrates in the DuPage River. Competition in regional and state science fairs and Science Olympiad is considered an integral part of the science program. All students are strongly encouraged to participate, and the seventh group students are required to do so. All students study French, which is taught by language immersion, a technique in which they only speak French during language study. All signs in the building are written in both French and English.Follett 2006, p. 38. Students begin French instruction in junior kindergarten, and continue on to study French four times a week in groups one through eight. They culminate their study with a week-long experience in Quebec in group eight, during which they only speak French. Visual art study begins with drawing and painting and then advances to more complex techniques such as sculpture, stained glass, architecture, photography, and pottery. Students learn in a variety of media, including watercolor, oil pastels, charcoal, and clay. Music study begins in the early childhood program. As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in vocal music, playing Orff instruments and recorders, dancing, and public performance. In middle school, students develop music literacy by reading and writing music, playing choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture and the history of jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance. The drama program begins in acting and dramatic writing, directing, and the technical arts in the fourth group. Students practice both rehearsed and improvised performances to create pantomimes, monologues, films, and short plays. Their theatrical work culminates in the eighth group with the performance of one-act plays the students write and direct themselves and the production of a professionally scripted full-length play. Artistically inclined students can extend their arts studies outside of class in optional activities including Art Club, Chorus, Orchestra, Tech Club, Drama Club, and the Variety Show. An Avery Coonley student with a tablet computer, assigned to older students and made available to all students beginning at age three  Technology  Avery Coonley began using computers for instruction in 1971 and offering computer programming to students as young as the fourth group in 1976. Desktop computers were brought into the classrooms to teach math, language arts, music, art, and computer programming, in 1978. Students begin learning basic keyboard and mouse skills in kindergarten and progress to multimedia presentations, data management, and software coding in the eighth group. In what ACS calls \\"one-to-one computing\\", every student in the fifth group through the eighth group receives a tablet computer, which they use to manage their daily schedules, work on class assignments, and prepare special projects. Students in early childhood and junior kindergarten have shared tablets available, and each kindergarten through the fourth group class has at least four. Students study in classrooms equipped with wireless overhead projectors, manipulate programs and presentations on touchscreen-equipped SMART board systems, and engage in self-paced classroom learning using ActiveExpression wireless response systems. Students, teachers, and parents communicate and interact online via a school-wide intranet and an extranet for parents. Sixteen dual platform iMacs were added in 2009 for computer lab work.  Traditions  The Thanksgiving Program in 1962. The most treasured of the ACS traditions, it has been performed each year since 1929. A hallmark of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes‚Äîtrees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects‚Äîthat built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s‚Äîthe Maypole dance by the fifth group dates back to the beginning of the Cottage School.Portman 2008, p. 46. The annual third group overnight nature trip to Wisconsin, dates back to 1974, and the eighth group French immersion trip began in the 1970s with trips to Paris and since the mid-1990s to Quebec.Portman 2008, p. 85. Other lower school traditions, such as the Native American Fair and class visit to the Coonley Estate, also have a long history at Avery Coonley.Portman 2008, p. 47. Middle school traditions include the alternating annual Greek and Shakespeare Fests, the sixth group World's Fair, and a seventh group trip to Washington, DC. In the annual Thanksgiving Program, the students, in identical brown capes, silently construct a large cornucopia of fruits and vegetables in a ceremony choreographed to music prepared by each class. The food is later donated to the Salvation Army. It is the most treasured of the school traditions, and has been performed every year, virtually unchanged, since 1929.  Extracurricular activities  Many of the extracurricular activities offered at ACS offer an extension of classroom subjects and an opportunity for students to pursue those studies in additional depth. Within the arts program, chorus, creative writing, drama, art, and three levels of orchestra are offered as optional activities. Students in these groups have opportunities to perform and exhibit their work throughout the year. The Book Club is available to students in groups six and above to extend the reading program. Computer Club, Creative Writing Club, Art Club, French Film Club, and Drama Club also offer opportunities to build on classroom activities. Student Council is primarily a service organization, which organizes charitable fund raising and community service opportunities in which all students can participate. Two representatives are elected from each group, one through eight, for each school year. Students may also volunteer for the Annual staff, which edits and produces the yearbook, Reflections. Intramural sports are offered to students in group five and interscholastic sports are available in groups five through eight. ACS competes in the West DuPage Elementary School Association (WDESA) Conference. Team sports include co-ed soccer and girls' volleyball in the fall, boys' and girls' basketball in the winter, and co-ed track in the spring. There are no team tryouts and all students are free to participate. ACS students participate actively in academic competitions at the state and national level, including MATHCOUNTS, Science Olympiad, and other math and science competitions, as well spelling bees, geography bees, and contests in other subjects. The Chess Club competes locally, and won the first-place trophy in the Naperville Chess Tournament in 2009.  Student body and finances  Admission is competitive and decisions are based on evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results at or above the 95th percentile (at or above 124 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting. Avery Coonley serves 378 students aged 3 through 14 as of 2010, with a nearly even ratio of males to females in each grade. ACS seeks to achieve ethnic diversity in every group, and offers limited need-based aid to families of children who would otherwise be unable to attend. The student body is \\"primarily middle- and upper-class white suburban children\\", and students \\"come from some of the most affluent families\\" in Chicago's western suburbs, but thirty percent of the students are non-white. Tuition for kindergarten through group eight was $23,950, junior kindergarten was $11,700, and early childhood $6,200 in 2018. The Annual Giving Fund makes up 3.5 percent and the Annual Auction another 5 percent of the operating budget ($5.9 million in 2008‚Äì2009).  Academic achievement  \\"Avery Coonley reports that scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, an exam given in schools across the United States, are in the top 1 percent in the nation\\", with average scores of 99 in all eight grades and all four test sections (vocabulary, comprehension, language arts, and mathematics). Avery Coonley was one of seventeen Illinois schools recognized as a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education in 1987‚Äì88 for \\"excellence in student success, school philosophy, curriculum, leadership, and climate\\". Over five percent of Avery Coonley graduates since 1989 have been admitted to the nationally recognized Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA), Illinois' public, competitive-entry, boarding school for top math and science students. Avery Coonley students have a record of top honors at the state and national level in science, math, geography and other subjects stretching back as far as 1989. In recent competitions, students won 24 Gold Medals at the 2009 Illinois Junior Academy of Science (IJAS) Science Fair, and won the Science Olympiad Jr. High State Championship. Avery Coonley won the 2009 IMSA Junior High Mathematics Competition (with four out of five first place awards) and placed second in the 2009 Illinois State MATHCOUNTS competition. In 2008, a seventh group student placed in the top 0.2 percent of competitors from around the world with a perfect score in the 24th annual American Mathematics Contest. In 2009, the seventh and eighth group Social Studies teams both placed third in the nation at the National Social Studies League contest and an ACS student won the Illinois Geography Bee, The same year, two eighth group students received perfect scores on Le Grand Concours‚Äîthe National French Contest of the American Association of Teachers of French. Of the 40 Avery Coonley students who took Le Grand Concours, 32 placed in the top ten in the nation at their grade level. Avery Coonley third group students \\"won highest honors in the WordMasters Challenge, a national language arts competition\\" in 2007, placing eighth in the nation out of more than 200 teams. Controversy erupted in 1994, when ACS won the Illinois State Science Fair team competition for the fourth year in a row, prompting the IJAS \\"to banish the school from team competition for [the] next year, on the grounds that their students were 'just too good. The incident attracted national attention and was decried as an example of the \\"dumbing down\\" of education and the victory of self-esteem over excellence in schools. The IJAS relented under pressure from the media, but eliminated the team competition altogether in future years. Avery Coonley students won 24 top individual awards the following year.

If 10 (line feed) is encountered, we're done. 46 is the decimal point ('.'), 43 and 45 are positive and negative signs ('+', '-') and 69/101 is uppercase/lowercase 'e' (to indicate a number in scientific format). As such it will recognize the following properly: 2 45 055 46. 78.1 2e5 78.3e12 69.0e-3 3e+3 but not: .3 -5 3.e2 2e5.1  Syntax  Ragel's input is a regular expression only in the sense that it describes a regular language; it is usually not written in a concise regular expression, but written out into multiple parts like in Extended Backus‚ÄìNaur form. For example, instead of supporting POSIX character classes in regex syntax, Ragel implements them as built-in production rules. As with usual parser generators, Ragel allows for handling code for productions to be written with the syntax. The code yielding the above example from the official website is: action dgt { printf(\\"DGT: %c \\", fc); } action dec { printf(\\"DEC: . \\"); } action exp { printf(\\"EXP: %c \\", fc); } action exp_sign { printf(\\"SGN: %c \\", fc); } action number { /*NUMBER*/ } # A floating-point number literal. number = ( [0-9]+ $dgt ( '.' @dec [0-9]+ $dgt )?

The syndrome is similar to Paradise Syndrome, in which the patient suffers a feeling of dissatisfaction despite having achieved all their dreams. History This phrase was coined by Dutch psychologists Ad Vingerhoets and Maaike van Huijgevoort, who presented a paper titled \\"Leisure sickness: An explorative study\\" at a meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society on March 7, 2001. Symptoms include headaches (even migraines), fatigue, muscular aches and pains, and illnesses such as colds and flus. Sufferers (and for about 3% of the population, this occurs every weekend), typically have, according to the authors, an \\"inability to transition from the work to the non-work environment, a high need for achievement and a high sense of responsibility.\\" Medical history Ad Vingerhoets, associate professor of clinical health Psychology at Tilbury University in the Netherlands, has found that this problem is caused by stress and a difficulty to switch from work to leisure activities. Ester Sternberg, a researcher of neuroendocrine immunology at the National Institutes of Health, blames this condition on hormones and stress as they affect the nervous system and immune system.

In the ensuing years, Lenz did much important work on the thalidomide syndrome. He also did work of value in clinical genetics and cytogenetics. He described a number of malformation syndromes, several of which bear his name today. He was an editor of the journal Human Genetics and published a textbook of medical genetics. Lenz studied medicine from 1937 to 1943. Besides his studies he was a group leader in Hitlerjugend, a member of National Socialist German Students' League (the Nazi students' union) and became an active member of the SA.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2005, , p. 367. A possible shift to the SS 1941 was vetoed by his SA foremen. From 1944 till 1948 Lenz worked as a physician in Luftwaffe hospitals during World War II and then in a prisoner- of-war camp in England. After stints in biochemistry in G√∂ttingen and medicine in Kiel, he became physician-in-chief of the Eppendorfer Kinderklinik in 1952 and was named to the chair of pediatrics at the University of Hamburg in 1961. Lenz became director of the Institute of Human Genetics in M√ºnster in 1965. Widukind Lenz was the son of Fritz Lenz, also a geneticist, but one of an entirely different stripe. Fritz Lenz espoused eugenics and influenced the racial hygiene policies of the Third Reich. Widukind Lenz died respected as an eminent physician and a humanitarian. He was the younger brother of mathematician Hanfried Lenz.

As the former Chief Economist and Member of the Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) Issing developed the 'two pillar' approach to monetary policy decision-making that the ECB has adopted.  Life  Issing studied economics at the University of W√ºrzburg from 1955 until 1960 with temporary studies in London and Paris. From 1960 to 1966 he worked as a research assistant at the University of W√ºrzburg. He earned his PhD in 1961 and received his postdoctoral lecture qualification (habilitation) in 1965. In 1967 Issing became director of the Institute for International Economic Relations at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and full professor at the faculty of economics and social sciences of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. In 1973 he was appointed Professor of Economics, Monetary Affairs and International Economic Relations at the University of W√ºrzburg. From 1988 to 1990 Issing was a member of the German Council of Economic Experts and in 1990 he became a member of the board of the Deutsche Bundesbank with a seat on the Central Bank Council. In 1998 Issing became a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, responsible for the Directorates General Economics and Research as well as its first Chief Economist. Since June 2006 Issing has been president of the Center for Financial Studies (CFS) at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main and from 2007 until 2018 he was an international advisor to Goldman Sachs. In October 2008 Issing chaired a German government expert group on the new financial order that drew up proposals on how to reform international financial markets (also known as \\"Issing Commission\\"). The group published six reports. In 2008 Issing was also a member of the high level group of the European Commission on financial supervision in the EU chaired by Jacques de Larosi√®re. He was a Member of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance, which was formally established by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors for the period 2017-2018.

Publications  Issing's scientific publications almost cover the whole range of recent economic policy issues. His two main research topics are monetary theory and policy and international economic relations. His most recent books are: * \\"Der Euro in st√ºrmischen Zeiten\\" about economic and monetary policy at Center for Financial Studies 2006-2015 (Vahlen, 2016) * \\"Einf√ºhrung in die Geldtheorie\\" (Introduction to Monetary Theory), fifteenth edition, Munich 2011.\\"Einf√ºhrung in die Geldtheorie\\" (Vahlen, 2011) (Translations into Chinese and Bulgarian) * \\"Der Euro.

He warned EU member states not to violate the no- bailout clause that prohibits the assumption of liability for other countries‚Äô debts. In October 2016 Issing warned that the Stability and Growth Pact was near to failure, there was no market discipline because of ECB interventions and no fiscal control mechanism from markets or politicians. The ECB had \\"crossed the Rubicon\\" and was in an untenable position, struggling to carry out its conflicting roles as agent of monetary policy, banking regulator, and Troika enforcer. Noting that the bank already held over ‚Ç¨1 trillion of bonds bought at artificially low or negative yields, so would face great losses when interest rates rise again, he warned. The reputational risk of such actions by a central bank would have been unthinkable in the past.\\" His conclusion was that in its current form the euro project was unworkable and one day would collapse.

Early life and upbringing  Nazir Ahmad was born in 1831 to a family of scholars in Rehar village, Bijnor District, U.P., India. His father, Saadat Ali Khan, was a teacher at a religious seminary, madrassa. Until the age of nine, he was home- schooled in Persian and Arabic.

Ahmad's family was greatly opposed to sending boys to educational institutions running on western lines and urged that education should be confined within the walls of the mosque. However, on a visit to Delhi College, he was offered a scholarship to complete his studies at the college. He took advantage of the opportunity and enrolled in the college in 1846. However,, he enrolled in the Urdu section of the college, as his father had said to him, ‚Äúhe would rather see him (Ahmad) die than learn English‚Äù.Pritchett, Frances W. ‚ÄúAfterword: The First Urdu Bestseller‚Äù.

P.214 During his time at the mosque at Delhi, Ahmad also discreetly arranged his own marriage to Maulvi Abd ul-Khaliq's granddaughter. Student living in the mosque helped the Maulvi Sahab with daily chores. Ahmad had to carry in his lap a little girl, who became his wife as he grew up, as his teacher was fond of his hard-working habits and good character.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh.

Retrieved 5 October 2019.  Life after Delhi College  Upon completion of his education, in 1853, Ahmad joined the British colonial administration. He began his life as a school teacher, teaching Arabic in a small school at Kunjah, in Gujarat district, in Punjab. After serving two years in Kunjah, he was appointed as deputy inspector of schools in Cawnpore, but his work there was affected by the mutiny of 1857. At the outbreak of the mutiny he rejoined his family back in Delhi. There, he witnessed the ugly experience of the year of the war.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. p.120Lal, Ruby. \\"Gender and Sharafat: Re-reading Nazir Ahmad.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 18, no. 1 (2008): 15-30. http://www.jstor.org/stable/27755909 Over time his English improved enough that he could translate English text into Urdu. The first time his acumen at translation was put to test when upon the desire of Lieutenant Governor Sir William Muir of North Western Provinces, Ahmad translated the Income Tax Act from English to Urdu. Later a board was convened to carry out the translation of the Indian penal code to Urdu. Ahmad was an important member of board and carried out a chunk of the translation himself.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. p.120-121 In recognition for his hard work and ability, the colonial government decided to give him an appointment in the revenue department, in which he first worked as a Tehsildar, and then in 1863, as a Deputy Collector.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. p.121 Ahmad garnered more acclaim from his story books. As his daughters were growing up, he realized that there were no good Urdu books focused on the education of girls. He began writing a story for his daughters. The way he in ‚Äòtrue to life‚Äô manner described the ‚Äòhouse of the family‚Äô and the ‚Äòtalks between the members of the family‚Äô captured the fascination of his girls. The girls kept pressing him to write more and more of the story. The fame of his stories spread in the neighborhood, and copies of the manuscripts were made and other girls read own their own.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. p.123 Initially, Ahmad wrote without any thought of publication. His writings were initially limited to a small social circle. It was the chance discovery of these stories by Mathew Kempson, the British Director of Public Instruction, on his visit to Jhansi where Ahmad was serving, that led to book being published. It was published under the name Mirat-ul-Urus, ‚ÄúBride‚Äôs Mirror‚Äù, in 1869.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. p.124 Mirat ul Urus won huge acclaim upon being published. When Sir William Muir, who knew Ahmad from before, saw the book, he was quite impressed by it. Two months after Kempson's visit to Jhansi, where he came across Ahmad's writing, he sent Ahmad a letter telling how his book was ‚Äòfirst of its kind‚Äô and was awarded a cash prize of 1000 rupees. At a Darbar held in Agra in 1869, Sir Williams publicly praised the book. He also gave the author a clock as personal present with the author's name inscribed on it.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. p.124-125  Life after retirement  On his return to Delhi, Ahmad undertook the task of translating the Quran to Urdu. He devoted three years to this task. Assisted by four hired Maulvis, he completely absorbed himself in this task. He translated it into idiomatic Urdu, to enable Urdu speaking people to understand the content better. He also included parenthetical phrases in the translation to make the meaning of the text more clear. This translation brought more fame to Ahmad than any of his earlier publications.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. The New School of Urdu Literature. (1898). pp. 47-61. Towards the later part of his stay in the city, Ahmad ceased to write fiction and got more involved in Sir Syed's political activities. In these political campaigns he explored his gift at oratory. He made his first public speech at the annual meeting of Tibbia College in Delhi. This is probably when he realized that ‚Äòhis tongue could wield a greater influence than his pen‚Äô, in stirring the masses. The demand of his eloquent speeches made him to travel to Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Aligarh and Lahore were also his frequent stops. He made the most speeches at the annual meetings of Mohammadan Educational Conferences. The Anjuman-i-Himayat Islam, Lahore invited him for their annual anniversary meetings and his lecture of sideline of the gathering attracted throngs of crowds. With his commendable sense of humor and eloquent recitation of verses, he could hold his audience ‚Äòspell bound for two to three hours in a stretch‚Äô.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. Famous Urdu Poets and Writers. p.127-128  Literary works   Binat-un-Nash  The novel had ‚ÄòAsghari‚Äô from Mirat-ul-Uroos as the chief character, although here Asghari is a school teacher. The idea of female education is a core theme of this books. That is done by giving lessons in general education and physical sciences through conversations between a teacher and her student. This publishing was also a great success. This was the time when Ahmad's writings became a mode of guidance for the girls of Mohammadan families.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. The New School of Urdu Literature. p.55  Taubat-un-Nashuh  It is a story of a ‚Äòpenitent sinner‚Äô, who fighting cholera out of hopelessness, turns himself to the right path of God. His wife embraces the change in her husband. However, his children, especially the eldest son, have indulged into irretractable bad manners. The author talks about how the former habits of the father led to the eldest son's being spoiled. NAhmadazir through his story highlights the importance of grooming and disciplining kids as they are growing up. Simultaneously, he stresses on the youth to heed the advice of their elders.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh. The New School of Urdu Literature. p.57  Mirat-ul-Uroos  This is the first novel written by Ahmad and it is also the first novel of Urdu literature. It is the story of two sisters, Asghari and Akbari. Asghari was younger sister and she was really intelligent, doing every thing with wisdom and intelligence. Akbari was a foolish girl, losing much because of her foolishness. Through this novel Ahmad tried to light up consciousness in girls about the discipline of house keeping. Even this novel was owned by British rule and they published it in a large number.  Last days  Despite holding a post in the British government, Ahmad still preferred the traditional Indian lifestyle, rather than living life in the more anglicized modern British lifestyle.Abdul Qadir, Sheikh.

This avoids boiling a live shellfish which may be able to experience pain in a way similar to vertebrates. The CrustaStun comprises a stainless-steel box approximately the size of a domestic microwave oven containing a tray with a wet sponge and an electrode. The shellfish is placed in the box and when the lid is closed, the wet sponge conducts the current which electrocutes the animal with a 110 volt, 2‚Äì5 amp charge. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab. The inventor of the device, Simon Buckhaven, worked for two years with scientists from the University of Bristol to develop the device which is manufactured by a company in England, at an estimated cost of ¬£2,500 (in 2009). There are claims that shellfish killed with the CrustaStun taste better than those killed by boiling.

C. Boyle. It concerns a young deaf woman who becomes the victim of a credit card fraud and identity theft. When the police are unwilling to help, the woman and her boyfriend attempt to track down the criminal themselves. Plot summary Dana Halter is an American woman in her early thirties who at the age of four suffered an infection which left her profoundly deaf. Since then, she has been able to master her life astonishingly well: she has acquired an academic degree and teaches at a school for the deaf in San Roque, likely analogous to Santa Barbara, California. Her boyfriend, Bridger Martin, is a \\"hearie,\\" a man a few years younger than herself who creates special effects for the film industry. Out of love, Martin has gone to great lengths to accommodate her disability. For example, he has taken a course in sign language. William \\"Peck\\" Wilson is an American raised in Peterskill, New York who is angry with society for failing him. Once a promising young restaurateur, he enters into a sour marriage, has a child with his wife, becomes dependent on his father-in-law's money, and is eventually dumped by his wife. Subsequently, his life takes a turn for the worse and he has to serve a short prison sentence. When he is released from jail, he moves to Marin County, California, takes up a criminal career of stealing others' identities and spending these identities' money to furnish his elaborate tastes. One such stolen identity belongs to Dana Halter, the deaf woman. Peck believes Dana is a man, and now has a driver's license and a credit card in \\"his\\" name. He lives together with an attractive Russian gold digger called Natalia and her daughter by a former lover. He has made Natalia believe that he is a physician. Peck and Natalia live a luxurious life at the expense of Dana Halter and others. After Dana Halter is put in jail on a charge perpetrated by Wilson in her name, she and Bridger Martin are irate. They decide to track down the identity thief, and a cross-country chase ensues that ends in Peterskill, New York. References External links * T.C.

Crossing lights along Route 18 spur *Route 18 Bikeway Spur - The northern trail head, completed in 2005, extends to the Wall Township municipal recreational complex along the abandoned Route 18 right-of-way. Unlike the original section, the Route 18 spur was not built on a former rail bed but rather an undeveloped limited access highway right-of-way; as result, the trail is subject to rapid changes in its grade and pathway. The Route 18 spur has electronic crosswalk warning signals at most road crossings; these crossing lights augment the standard Zebra crossing and signage found on typical trail crossings. Unlike a HAWK beacon, these lights are only amber caution flashers that do not require a motorist to stop. *Manasquan (North Main Street) - eastern trail head  History The Freehold & Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad operated under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), which abandoned the Manasquan-Farmingdale segment in 1966. Cycling enthusiast and retired radio researcher Edgar Felix lobbied the borough of Manasquan to obtain the abandoned roadbed that same year.Manasquan municipal ordinance No. 786 The following year the path was extended through the Allenwood section of Wall Township, terminating at Hospital Road in Wall Township. In 2005, the trail was extended west from Hospital Road across state park land to the public access area of Allaire State Park and north along the abandoned Route 18 right-of-way to the Wall Township Municipal Complex. Trail crossing Atlantic Avenue As of September 2011, Wall Township was seeking a $180,000 matching grant from Monmouth County to add a spur trail that would extend the Edgar Felix trail along Hospital Road to meet with the Allaire mountain biking trails. This new spur would begin where the current trail crosses Hospital road on its way to the main entrance of Allaire State Park. There is also a proposal to continue this new spur to the Howell Township border at a future date. The unimproved right-of-way for the Freehold & Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad continues west through Allaire State Park until it is severed by Interstate 195.

Industrial Commission of Ohio, 236 U.S. 230 (1915), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling by a 9-0 vote that the free speech protection of the Ohio Constitution, which was substantially similar to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, did not extend to motion pictures. Background The state government of Ohio had passed a statute in 1913 forming a board of censors which had the duty of reviewing and approving all films intended to be exhibited in the state. The board charged a fee for the approval service. The board could order the arrest of anyone showing an unapproved film in the state. Decision The Court stated: The Court described movies in some technical detail and noted their popularity but wrote that as \\"they may be used for evil, ... We cannot regard [the censorship of movies] as beyond the power of government.\\" The Court added that it would be equally unreasonable to grant free speech protection to the theater or the circus and noted that in many prior cases regarding government licensure of theatrical performances, the issue of freedom of opinion had not been raised. The plaintiff was Mutual Film Corporation, a movie distributor. Mutual had also argued that in addition to the violation of its freedom of speech, the censorship board was interfering with interstate commerce in violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause and that the government had illegally delegated legislative authority to a censor board. Those arguments were dismissed by the Court more perfunctorily.  Overturned  The decision that motion pictures did not merit First Amendment protection drove an increase in regulation of movie content, which culminated in the enforcement in July 1934 of the Production Code over all Hollywood films. The Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, was not law but an agreement between studios and theaters to self- censor, partly to avoid the patchwork of local censorship laws that existed around the country. In May 1952, the Supreme Court overturned its Mutual decision in Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson, popularly known as the \\"Miracle Decision\\" since it referred to the short film The Miracle, part of the anthology film L'Amore (1948), directed by Roberto Rossellini. The Production Code was loosened in the 1950s and 1960s and was eventually abandoned, in favor of the MPAA film rating system in 1968.

He was provost of Reichersberg Abbey and a Canon Regular. He studied at Freising, Moosburg, and Hildesheim. In 1119, Bishop Hermann of Augsburg called him as \\"scholasticus\\" to the cathedral school of that city; shortly afterwards, though still a deacon, he made him a canon of the cathedral. Gradually Gerhoh adopted a stricter ecclesiastical attitude, and eventually withdrew (1121) from the simoniacal Bishop Hermann, and took refuge in the monastery of Raitenbuch in the Diocese of Freising. After the Concordat of Worms (1122) Bishop Hermann was reconciled with the legitimate pope, Callistus II, whereupon Gerhoh accompanied the bishop to the Lateran Council of 1123. On his return from Rome Gerhoh resigned his canonicate, and with his father and two half-brothers joined the Austin canons at Raitenbuch (1124). Bishop Kuno of Ratisbon ordained him a priest in 1126, and gave him the parish of Cham, which he later resigned under threats from Hohenstaufen followers whom he had offended at the Synod of W√ºrzburg in 1127. He returned to Ratisbon, and in 1132 Conrad I of Abensberg, Archbishop of Salzburg, appointed him provost of Reichersberg, to the spiritual and material advantage of that monastery. Archbishop Conrad sent him several times on special missions to Rome; in 1143 he also accompanied, together with Arnold of Brescia, Cardinal Guido di Castello of Santa Maria in Portico on his embassy to Bohemia and Moravia. Eugene III (1145‚Äì53) held Gerhoh in high esteem; his relations with the successors of that pope were less pleasant. On the occasion of the disputed papal election in 1159 (Alexander III and Victor IV) Gerhoh sided with Alexander III, but only after long hesitation; for this action the imperial party looked on him with hatred. For refusing to support the antipope, Archbishop Conrad was condemned to banishment in 1166, and the monastery of Reichersberg was repeatedly attacked; Gerhoh himself was forced to take refuge in flight, and died soon after his return to Reichersberg. Gerhoh was a reformer in the spirit of the Gregorian ideas. He aimed particularly and zealously at the reform of the clergy; it seemed to him that this object could not be attained unless the community life were generally adopted. Works Gerhoh compiled the Annales Reicherspergenses (Annals of Reichersberg), which cover the years 921‚Äì1167. His pupil, Magnus of Reichersberg, continued them down to 1195 and later writers added material down to 1279. His reformist views and his ecclesiastical policy are set forth in the following works: *De √¶dificio Dei seu de studio et cura disciplin√¶ ecclesiastic√¶ (P.L., CXCIV, 1187‚Äì1336; Ernst Sackur, 136-202) *Tractatus adversus Simoniacos (P.L., 1335‚Äì1372; Sackur, 239‚Äì272; see also Jaksch in Mittheilungen des Instituts f√ºr √∂sterreichische Geschichtsforschung, VI [1885], 254-69) *Liber epistolaris ad Innocentium II.

Theologie X (1871), 565‚Äì606; Sackur, 503-525]. His principal work he left unfinished, Commentarius in Psalmos (P.L., CXCIII, 619‚Äì1814; CXCIV, 1-1066); it offers much interesting material for contemporaneous history. This is particularly true of his commentary on Ps. lxiv, that appeared separately as Liber de corrupto Ecclesi√¶ statu ad Eugenium III Papam (P.L., CXCIV, 9-120); Sackur, 439-92). There are also a number of polemical works and letters against the Christological views of Abelard, Gilbert de la Porr√©e, and Bishop Eberhard of Bamberg; others deal with the errors of Folmar, Provost of Triefenstein, on the subject of the Holy Eucharist. The genuineness of the Vit√¶ beatorum abbatum Formbacensium Berengeri et Wirntonis, O.S.B., generally ascribed to Gerhoh, is denied by Wattenbach. The Migne edition of Gerhoh's works is faulty and incomplete. Those of his writings which are of importance for the study of the history of that period were edited by Sackur in the Monumenta Germani√¶ Historica: Libelli de lite imperatorum et pontificum, III (Hanover, 1897), 131‚Äì525; also by Scheibelberger, Gerhohi Opera adhuc inedita (Linz, 1875).

The best known D-Day is during World War II, on June 6, 1944‚Äîthe day of the Normandy landings‚Äîinitiating the Western Allied effort to liberate western Europe from Nazi Germany. However, many other invasions and operations had a designated D-Day, both before and after that operation. The terms D-Day and H-Hour are used for the day and hour on which a combat attack or operation is to be initiated. They designate the day and hour of the operation when the day and hour have not yet been determined, or where secrecy is essential. For a given operation, the same D-Day and H-Hour apply for all units participating in it. When used in combination with numbers, and plus or minus signs, these terms indicate the point of time preceding or following a specific action. Thus, H‚àí3 means 3 hours before H-Hour, and D+3 means 3 days after D-Day. (By extension, H+75 minutes is used for H-Hour plus 1 hour and 15 minutes.) Planning papers for large-scale operations are made up in detail long before specific dates are set. Thus, orders are issued for the various steps to be carried out on the D-Day or H-Hour minus or plus a certain number of days, hours, or minutes. At the appropriate time, a subsequent order is issued that states the actual day and times. Other days such as A-Day (Battle of Leyte), L-Day (Battle of Okinawa) etc. have different meanings for the military. Other languages have terms equivalent to D-Day such as \\"Hari H\\" (Indonesian),–ß–∞—Å –ß (Russian), Dagen D (Swedish), ' (Slovenian), ' (Basque), ' (French), ' (Irish), Tag X (German), and ' (Romanian). The initial D in D-Day has been given various meanings in the past, while more recently it has obtained the connotation of \\"Day\\" itself, thereby creating the phrase \\"Day-Day\\", or \\"Day of Days\\". History Official U.S. Twelfth Army situation map for 2400 hours, 6 June 1944 The earliest use of these terms by the United States Army that the U.S. Army Center of Military History has been able to find was during World War I.\\"What does the \\"D\\" signify in D-Day, and the \\"H\\" signify in H-Hour?\\" U.S. Army Center of Military History.

In Field Order Number 9, First Army, American Expeditionary Forces, dated 7 September 1918: \\"The First Army will attack at H hour on D day with the object of forcing the evacuation of the St. Mihiel Salient.\\" D-Day for the invasion of Normandy by the Allies was originally set for June 5, 1944, but bad weather and heavy seas caused U.S. Army General Dwight David Eisenhower to delay until June 6 and that date has been popularly referred to ever since by the short title \\"D-Day\\". Because of the connotation with the invasion of Normandy, planners of later military operations sometimes avoided the term to prevent confusion. For example, Douglas MacArthur's invasion of Leyte began on \\"A-Day\\", and the invasion of Okinawa began on \\"L-Day\\". The Allies' proposed invasions of Japan would have begun on \\"X-Day\\" (on Ky≈´sh≈´, scheduled for November 1945) and \\"Y-Day\\" (on Honsh≈´, scheduled for March 1946).

It was released for the Atari ST and Amiga in 1988. Gameplay Main screen of the Dragon 32 version The 8-bit and 16-bit versions of the game have a different setting and characters but the same basic premise. In the 8-bit versions, Tanglewood is a peaceful glade under threat from a property developer and wizard named Sharck. The player controls five different animal characters who have ten days to defeat Sharck before the bulldozers move in. In the 16-bit version, the premise is that Tanglewood contains valuable minerals that have only been discovered after the protagonist's uncle Arthur acquired mining rights from an unscrupulous company. The company now want to mine Tanglewood themselves and are suing Arthur for the rights back. The player has 10 days until the court case and must find the documents to win the case. Instead of controlling animals, the player controls five remote controlled vehicles.Tanglewood review, Betty D.

In late 2001, singer Julia Johnson and producer/bassist Mark Maclaine met, and early the following year formed the band Second Person. Drummer √Ålvaro L√≥pez was recruited in mid-2004 to complete the final line up and their debut album Chromatography was released later that year. It went on to sell out of its initial white-label run in United Kingdom, USA and Australia through word of mouth and publicity generated by musical placements on documentaries and extreme sports films. The opening song \\"Too Cold To Snow\\" was later featured in the closing credits of 2006 film Dolls. The band went on to record a live DVD at The Bedford in London, score music for a number of British broadcasters (including BBC and Channel 4) and became one of the main suppliers of music for the international broadcaster: The Extreme Sports Channel. The band released their second album The Elements on 9 August 2007, it was co-produced and mixed by producer/engineer Tony Platt (Bob Marley, Iron Maiden and also credited with engineering the second biggest selling album of all time: AC/DC's Back in Black). This album gained a high media profile in Europe as Second Person were the first British band to have raised the $50,000 target on Sellaband - which allowed fans to invest directly in bands on the site.

The palace complex is about a kilometer away from the Phra Pathommachedi. The complex consists of five buildings and a Ganesh shrine. History Royal residence The Chaleemongkolasana Residence Before ascending the throne, the then Crown Prince Vajiravudh came to this city to pay homage to Phra Pathommachedi. He wished to build a palace here as a retreat and a residence during his pilgrimage trip to the stupa. He viewed the area as a strategic location. In 1907, he bought about 335 acres of land around Noen Prasart Hill (; ; \\"Castle Hill\\") from local people. Noen Prasart Hill is believed to be the site of an ancient palace. He then had Luang Phitak Manop (Noi Silapi, later Phraya Visukam Prasit) designed and supervised the construction of the palace. The construction began in 1902 by the end of Chulalongkorn's reign (1868 ‚Äì 1910). It was completed in 1911. Vajiravudh named it Sanam Chandra Palace after a natural pool nearby called \\"Sa Nam Chand\\" (; ; \\"Moon Pond\\"). In addition, the king had another plan for this palace. It was to serve not only as a retreat, but also as a stronghold during a national crisis. Here, he regularly held practices for the Wild Tigers Corps, a paramilitary troop. According to Vajiravudh's will, the palace was given to the government to be the site of military academy. However, after reign of Vajiravudh the palace has been closed and transformed to Nakhon Pathom's administrative area. Some palace halls had been dismantled and moved to National Museum in Bangkok for preservation. Silpakorn University Campus In 1965 Silpakorn University, a well known Thai university, for art and archaeology study, improved its educational program with additional new faculties and urgently need larger area to accommodate the expansion. The university and Thai cabinet approved to use the area of Sanam Chandra Palace to be the new university campus since the area was suitable since the palace was once belong to Vajiravudh, an archeologist and artist himself. Also in the palace ground has Ganesh Shrine, god of art and the symbol of university seal. Moreover, Nakhon Pathom is an important archaeological site for Dvaravati in Thailand. Restoration In 1981 Department of Fine Arts registered Sanam Chandra Palace as historical site. On December 1 st, 2003, the Committee for the Renovation of Sanam Chandra Palace chaired by Prince. Bejaratana Rajasuda, Vajiravudh's daughter, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, Nakhon Pathom Governor and Silpakorn University returned the palace including its satellite buildings to Bureau of the Royal Household following the wishes of Bejaratana Rajasuda. At present, the Bureau of the Royal Household has since opened the Bhimarn Prathom Residence including the Prayer Room in this residence, Samakkeemukamartaya Hall, Ganesh Shrine, Chaleemongkolasana Residence, Mareerajaratanabulung Residence, Thub Kwan Residence and Statue of Yalae, to the general public. Sanam Chandra Palace celebrated its 100-year anniversary from November 23, 2007 to December 2, 2007. Temporary Closing From October 1 st, 2017, Sanam Chandra Palace is temporary closing for renovation. The reopening date is still unannounced . Buildings Bhimarn Prathom Residence The first hall to be built in this palace, the Bhimarn Prathom Residence (; ) is a brick-and-cement building in western style, which was adapted to suit the tropical climate. The ventilation panes and railings around the upper floor of the building are in traditional elaborate Thai carving patterns. Located upstairs are a bed chamber, a bathroom, a dressing room, a conference room, a dining room, and a prayer room. In the prayer room sits a Buddha image in the First Sermon Attitude. The exquisite angelic congregation design on the mural in the prayer room was painted by Phraya Anusart Jitrakorn (Chan Jitrakorn). The residence frequently served as H. M. King Rama VI's private quarters (particularly before his coronation, and afterwards until 1913), his study, a reception hall, and an audience hall. Samakkeemukamartaya Hall The Samakkeemukkamartaya Hall (; ) Chaleemongkolasana Residence The Charliemongkolasana Residence is located in Sanamchandra Palace, Nakhonpathom. In 1908, this residence was built in the integration of 2 arts which are French renaissance and English half-timber. This residence was adapted for Thai weather atmosphere. At that time, the residence was named ‚ÄúYah Leh Residence‚Äù which came from the name of King Rama 6 (King Vajiravudh)‚Äôs dog. In 1915, King Rama 6 gave the name for this residence which is Charliemongkolasana residence that means ‚Äúthe auspicious residence of Charlie‚Äù. This residence was used for the residence of King Rama 6 when he met the Wild Tiger Corps at Sanamchandra Palace. The residence looks like a reddish-yellow small castle which has 2 floors and red roof-tile. The dining room and the living room are on the first floor. The study room, the royal bathroom and the royal bed chamber are on the second floor. The Yah Leh monument is located in front of this residence.

Besides hosting Tournament of Roses events, the venue hosted other events at the turn of the 20th century, such as the Southern California Horse Show Association's annual horse show. Tournament Park is best known as the site of the first eight Rose Bowl Games Its seating capacity in 1922 was 43,000, many of which were in temporary wooden bleachers that the city deemed unsafe, thus necessitating the construction of the Rose Bowl stadium, about northwest. Tournament Park hosted a handful of USC football games, chiefly against out-of-state opponents, in the 1910s and 1920s prior to the construction of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, since the park dwarfed USC's then on-campus venue of Bovard Field. Following the departure of the New Year's Day game to the new stadium in 1923, the facility's capacity was reduced substantially, though the parade route ended at Tournament Park for a number of years following the Rose Bowl's completion. Tournament Park, along with the Rose Bowl, served as the venue for Caltech's football team until the school dropped the program. The stadium site, now known as South Athletic Field, is bounded by the Fox-Stanton Track (named after former Caltech football coach Fox Stanton), and continues to serve as Caltech's track and field venue. The surrounding park, which continues under the Tournament Park moniker, contains a playground and picnic facility. The elevation of the park is approximately above sea level.

There is only one work that can be ascribed to him with certainty, the baptismal font in the parish church of Wittenberg (1457). This is decorated with figures of the Apostles. He died in 1487. Peter Vischer the Elder Peter Vischer the Elder Hermann's son, Peter Vischer the Elder (c.1455 ‚Äì7 January 1529), is the best known member of the family. He worked with the help of his five sons, Hermann, Peter, Hans, Paul. Hermann Vischer the Younger Tomb of Count Hermann VIII of Henneberg and wife Elizabeth of Brandenburg Hermann Vischer, the Younger (c.1486‚Äì1 January 1517) was the son of Peter Vischer the Elder. The tomb of Elisabeth and Hermann VIII of Henneberg in the Stadtkirche of R√∂mhild is sometimes attributed to Hermann and other times to the workshop in general. Tomb of Frederick the Wise Nuremberg Madonna attributed to Peter Vischer the Younger Peter Vischer the Younger Peter Vischer the Younger (1487‚Äì1528) was another son of Peter Vischer the Elder. Initially less well known, he has come to be seen as the equal in quality of his father with whom he worked. The tomb of the electoral prince Frederick the Wise in the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg (1521), previously thought to be by the Elder, is now thought to be by the Younger. The origin of the Nuremberg Madonna is disputed, and may not be Vischer's work at all. Hans Vischer Hans Vischer (1486‚Äì1546) was the son of Peter Vischer the Elder. Hans was thought to be an excellent craftsman but a less talented artist. He built the tomb of John the Steadfast in the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg. Brother Peter the Younger had done the tomb of John's brother Frederick the Wise at the same church. Upon the death of Peter the Elder in 1529 (Peter the Younger and Hermann had already died), the business was inherited by Peter's son Paul. He immediately sold it to his brother Hans, who completed the works in progress by his father. This included the bronze grave plate for Prince-Bishop Lorenz von Bibra of W√ºrzburg. In 1549, Hans left Nuremberg closing the chapter on the Vischers of Nuremberg. References * R.

History The Terrell Historic District is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The most notable building contained therein is the Terrell Country Store, built in 1891, once a focal point of trade and commerce in the area. The town was named after Pinckney Lawson Terrell (1853-1926), a circuit-riding Methodist preacher with ties to the nearby Rehobeth Methodist Church. The Terrell family history reports that a post office was established in 1893 at the T.F.

Later Silla  After the unification wars, the Tang Dynasty established territories in the former Goguryeo, and began to administer and establish communities in Baekje. Silla attacked the Chinese in Baekje and northern Korea in 671. The Tang Dynasty then invaded Silla in 674 but Silla defeated the Tang army in the north. Silla drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula by 676 to achieve unification of most of the Three Kingdoms. Later Silla was a golden age of art and culture, and Buddhism became a large part of Silla culture. Buddhist monasteries such as the Bulguksa are examples of advanced Korean architecture and Buddhist influence. State-sponsored art and architecture from this period include Hwangnyongsa Temple, Bunhwangsa Temple, and Seokguram Grotto, a World Heritage Site. Later Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River. \\"From what Ennin tells us, it seems that commerce between East China, Korea and Japan was, for the most part, in the hands of men from Silla. Here in the relatively dangerous waters on the eastern fringes of the world, they performed the same functions as did the traders of the placid Mediterranean on the western fringes. This is a historical fact of considerable significance but one which has received virtually no attention in the standard historical compilations of that period or in the modern books based on these sources. . . . While there were limits to the influence of the Koreans along the eastern coast of China, there can be no doubt of their dominance over the waters off these shores. . . . The days of Korean maritime dominance in the Far East actually were numbered, but in Ennin's time the men of Silla were still the masters of the seas in their part of the world.\\" Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world. Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists and contributed to Chinese Buddhism, including: Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak, a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism. Silla began to experience political troubles in the late 9th century. This severely weakened Silla and soon thereafter, descendants of the former Baekje established Later Baekje. In the north, rebels revived Goguryeo, beginning the Later Three Kingdoms period. Later Silla lasted for 267 years until, under King Gyeongsun, it was annexed by Goryeo in 935.  Balhae  Balhae and Silla in 830.

Balhae controlled the northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, much of Manchuria, and expanded into present-day Russian Maritime Province. Balhae styled itself as Goguryeo's successor state. In a time of relative peace and stability in the region, Balhae flourished in culture, especially during the long reign of the third King Mun (r. 737-793) and King Seon. At that time, Balhae was a culturally advanced country, so that even China referred to this kingdom as \\"a prosperous country of the East.\\" However, Balhae was severely weakened by the 10th century, and the Khitan Liao Dynasty conquered Balhae in 926. Goryeo absorbed some of Balhae's territory and received Balhae refugees, including the crown prince and the royal family, but compiled no known histories of Balhae. The 18th century Joseon dynasty historian Yu Deukgong advocated the proper study of Balhae as part of Korean history, and coined the term \\"Northern and Southern States period\\" to refer to this era.  Language  Due to the lack of linguistic evidence, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion for the linguistic relation between the Balhae and Silla languages. Shoku Nihongi implies that the Balhae language, a Goguryeo language, and Silla language share a close relationship: a student sent from Silla to Japan for an interpreter training in Japanese language assisted a diplomatic envoy from Balhae in communicating during the Japanese court audience. One terminology that people of Balhae used to describe \\"a king\\" is Gadokbu (transcribed as ÂèØÊØíÂ§´).

History The school was established in 1903 in Lorne Park (a community to the west of Toronto, now part of Mississauga) by Eugene Leland and his wife, and was then known as Lornedale Academy, and had eight students from Grades 1-9. By 1907, the enrollment had grown to 40 students. In 1911, Lornedale became a high school, serving grades 7-12, which led to a need for more space and equipment. The school began looking for a new site, and the present site in Oshawa (east of Toronto) was acquired. The school was renamed Buena Vista Academy, and opened in 1912. The school quickly grew. In 1914, it became a Union Conference school. In 1916, it became a junior college with fourteen grades, and its name was changed to Eastern Canadian Missionary Seminary. In 1920, the school was incorporated, leading to another name change, this time to Oshawa Missionary College. During the Depression years, enrollment decreased and some programs were discontinued, following which an improvement program was implemented in 1933. Enrollment decreased again during World War II, but following the war, the college enjoyed a period of expansion, reaching 200 students by the end of the 1950s. In 1960, the Branson School of Nursing was opened at North York Branson Hospital, a hospital which at the time was owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist church; this nursing program became affiliated with Oshawa Missionary College. In 1963, the school name was changed once more, to Kingsway College, reflecting a curriculum that included a complete academic program while decreasing the implication that the school was only a Bible college. During this time, Kingsway's choir and band rose to prominence, and began touring across Eastern Canada and New England. In 1975, the Branson school of nursing was closed due to a change in nursing education policy by the Ontario government. During the 14 years it was operational, the Branson school of nursing graduated 269 registered nurses. The closure of the nursing school led to the decision to close the remainder of the college program and merge it with Canadian Union College in Alberta, leaving Kingsway strictly a high school. There were some attempts in subsequent years to restart the nursing school, but at the present time no attempts have been successful. Enrollment rose in the 1980s to 300 students, and a number of new buildings were constructed, including the present administration building and the A.E. King Fitness Complex. In the 1990s, enrollment dropped down to 140, and financial pressures forced Kingsway to sell off some of its industries in order to survive. In 1999, the Ontario government introduced a new curriculum, which included the phasing out of OAC (grade 13) in 2002. In the 2000s, Kingsway's enrollment recovered, rising to 200 students. During this time, the Fraser Institute began its rankings of Ontario schools, and in its first ranking Kingsway was ranked the top academic high school in the Durham Region. Kingsway's basketball teams also began at this time. In 2017, enrollment reached 270 students. Academics Kingsway College is a private Christian boarding high school, that offers grade 9-12 education. Approximately half of Kingsway's students live in the dormitory, while students who live nearby have the option of attending as a day student. Kingsway's boarding students come from all across Eastern Canada, and internationally. Kingsway accepts a limited number of international students each year, especially from the United States, South Korea, and China. Kingsway is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Canada. Kingsway is accredited by the Board of Regents of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Kingsway follows the curriculum provided by the Ontario Ministry of Education, and students who graduate from Kingsway receive the Ontario Secondary School Diploma. Kingsway employs 18 teachers and 27 staff, for a student-to-teacher ratio of 15:1. Courses offered include English, math, science, French, religious studies, geography, history, music, ESL, business, accounting, law, physical education, art, computer studies, marketing, and numerous other electives. As part of the requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, all Kingsway graduates must complete 40 hours of community service prior to graduation. Elementary education from K‚Äì8 is provided by College Park Elementary School, a private school on the campus of Kingsway College. While CPES shares some of Kingsway's teachers, the elementary school operates under a completely different administrative structure, and is owned and operated by the Ontario Conference of the Seventh- day Adventist Church. School organizations The Student Association is headed by a Prime Minister, and is responsible for organizing many of the school functions, such as Mega Marathon, the fall banquet and valentine's banquet, the children's Christmas party, and Golden Unicorn. It is divided into the executive body and the senate, which is headed by the Deputy Prime Minister. The school yearbook is entitled Cedar Trails. It is released each June at the Yearbook Signing night, and has been released every year since 1946. The Cedar Trails staff is also responsible for publishing the student and faculty directory, entitled the Whozit. In Kingsway's history, there have been four student newspapers, beginning with The Studonian in 1920. The current edition, The Cedar Sentinel was founded in 1962, upon the changing of the school's name to Kingsway College. The Cedar Sentinel is published monthly, and features content produced by students, faculty, and staff. The Vox Viri Association (\\"Voice of the Men\\") was founded in 1933 as the Men's dorm club. Among its current traditions are to go to a Chinese buffet at the beginning of the year, followed by a trip to Pearson International Airport to watch planes and fancy cars. Nil Sine Numine (\\"Nothing without God's Will\\") is the Girls' dorm club, and it was founded in 1936. The club motto is \\"Deeds not words.\\" The Outdoor Club has been in existence since the early 1980s, and twice a year goes on backpacking, canoeing, and winter camping trips. Touring groups Kingsway maintains three major touring groups. These groups generally perform at local churches across Southern Ontario an average of once a month, usually for the church service. They also rotate long tours, with one group going east to Atlantic Canada, one group going west to the Great Lakes region, and one group going to any desired location each year, over either March break or the Easter long weekend. The oldest group is the Kingsway Symphonic Choir, whose founding date is unknown. The \\"Kingsway Chorale\\" - the touring portion of the choir for some seasons - and the \\"Kingsway Choir\\" were built under the direction of Ralph Coupland in the early 1960s. Under Coupland the choir became the first Kingsway group to begin extensively touring across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States. James Bingham continued to grow the choir in the 1970s, and under Bingham the choir toured with the famous New England Youth Ensemble and performed at the General Conference. The choir has produced many records and CDs, and has won several Kiwanis Music Festivals. The choir also performed at Carnegie Hall during the early 1980s. The choir is currently under the direction of Sharon Foreman. Though there have been many bands throughout the school's history, including a \\"Lornedale Band\\" which played in 1912, the current edition of the Kingsway Band was founded in the early 1960s under the direction of Jack McClarty. Much like the choir, the band is also highly acclaimed, has also recorded many CDs, and has won several Kiwanis Music Festivals throughout its history. In the 1970s, Ben Eby and Joanne (Klassen) Andersson were responsible for improving the quality of the band, taking the band to the newly opened Disney World, winning several Kiwanis titles in a row, and growing the ensemble into the streamlined touring operation that it remains today. At present, the band is directed by Andrew Brown. The Kingsway College Aerials are a gymnastics team whose mission is to promote healthy drug-free lifestyles in teens today. Founded in 1983 by Pierre Chartier, the club continues today with an annual membership between 25 and 40. The current head coach is Adam Mohns. The Kingsway Drama Club was founded in 1998 by current director Margaret Russnell. The club annually puts together a Christmas program and a spring play, which in the past has included Joseph (2003), Don't Kick the Turkeys (2004), and Sound of Music (2010). The club briefly held equal status as a touring group in the early 2000s before reverting to a normal club. Athletics Besides the Aerials, the centrepiece of the Kingsway athletics department, Kingsway also has a men's and women's varsity basketball team, called the Knights and Lady Knights respectively. Currently only the men's team is in operations. The men's basketball team competes at various tournaments, including the Cardinal Classic hosted by Andrews University. Their main rivals are the basketball team from Crawford Adventist Academy. Kingsway also has a strong intramurals program, in which the faculty regularly play with the students. Usual intramural sports include flag football, basketball, floor hockey, and soccer. The major sporting events are the Student/Faculty Football game, and the Alumni/Student Hockey game. Campus publications The Chanteclair is the weekly newsletter published by the President's office, which keeps students up-to-date on the events happening around campus. It has been published weekly for many decades. By tradition, the Chanteclair periodically hides the silhouette of an animal somewhere on its newsletter, which students may identify for a prize. The KC Contact is the alumni magazine. It is published quarterly. Work program Ever since Kingsway was founded, students have been required to work on campus as part of their education, and as a means of paying for tuition. Kingsway's work program is a philosophical choice, and it is viewed as a key part of each student's education. Today, work options include working at one of the campus industries, in the cafeteria, in janitorial, in the dormitory, as a reader, or as an office assistant. Students also have the opportunity to continue working at Kingsway during the summer. Campus industries The campus' first major industry was farming. At first, it was a poultry farm. As enrollment increased, so did the farms. Over the years the farm has included a dairy and a strawberry field, as well as a number of greenhouses. Currently, crops grown on campus are on a corn/soybean rotation, similar to the majority of farms in Southern Ontario. In 1911, the first printing press began operation. By 1920, it became the Canadian Watchman Press, housed in its own building. It employed many students throughout the last century, enabling them to afford a college education, until 1990 when it privatized and became Maracle Press. In 1921, College Woodwork was founded in the basement of the Ad Building. In 1962, it moved into its present facility, where it continued to employ a significant number of students‚Äîbeing the largest, and highest paying, on-campus student employer‚Äîas well as full-timers, producing desks, beds, and other wood furniture. In 2016, after five years of financial losses, the College Woodwork Operating Board voted to close the woodwork. In 1989, some of Kingsway's old greenhouses were repurposed as a garden centre. By 1996, Kingsway Greenhouse was privatized and has since become Oshawa's largest garden centre. The Kingsway Greenhouse continues to employ students and recent graduates of Kingsway College. Other historical industries have included a printing press known as College Press, a book bindery, a health food store, a sewing industry, a laundry, and a bakeshoppe.

The learner support offered can range from a hand in study skills for people who are re- entering education, to care and guidance for students with (ASD) and other learning disabilities. History Westminster Kingsway College on Gray's Inn Road, Kings Cross, London. The college was founded in September 2000 following the merger of Westminster and Kingsway Colleges. The Victoria centre, where the School of Hospitality first opened its doors to learners in 1910, celebrated its centenary in 2010. Based in Vincent Square, the centre houses the college's own restaurant, The Vincent Rooms, with cuisine prepared and served by second and third year professional chef students. The college provides community education, with a programme of neighbourhood learning in partnership with Camden Council and in Westminster with local organisations. The college's specialist subjects have been given to vocational training including Hospitality, Creative Media, Performing Arts, Business and Public Administration. It also provides higher education for about 250 full-time equivalent students on foundation degrees in Business, Hospitality Management, Culinary Arts, Travel & Tourism, Accounting and Public Administration. Westminster College began as a School of Hospitality in Vincent Square in 1910 when in 1908 a consultative committee which included Sir Isidore Salmon, Auguste Escoffier and Cesar Ritz was established to design training programmes in professional cookery in readiness to produce graduates that could work in London's finest hotels. The first course to be developed was the Cookery Technical Day School, which was soon to be formulated into the Professional Chef Diploma. Within a couple of years, the school had added food service to its course portfolio and a training restaurant was opened. Records show that this was in fact the UK's first Hospitality School established in 1910. The school developed during the interwar years as additional kitchens, cold rooms and larder and pastry areas were added. A two-year hotel manager's course replaced the food service course. There were plans for a 50-bedroom 'training hotel', which had begun construction in 1939. This unfortunately was stopped as a result of the outbreak of war and was never completed. Following the Second World War, the Vincent Rooms restaurant was extended, and in 1953 the Escoffier Restaurant was opened. Further kitchens were added as well as a wine cellar. The restaurants have evolved over a considerable period of time alongside the School of Hospitality and Culinary Arts at Westminster Kingsway College producing graduates who are now working in hotels and restaurants all over the world. In 1985 there was a substantial and comprehensive refit of the whole school. Before the merger, Kingsway College, previously known as Princeton College, was a large college in Camden. It received ¬£55million for redevelopment in 2009. Notable Principals included Fred Flower from 1960 to 1978. Regarded as one of the great humanist educators of his day, under Flower's leadership, Kingsway became one of the country's most diverse and thriving further education colleges, and his skill provided a framework for the development of unconventional ideas which came to powerfully influence British post-16 education. Flower sat on both the Newsom (1963) and the Taylor (1977) committees.Booth, Dick.

In the 1910 census, the village had a population of 562. It was at the time already predominantly populated by Croats, with Hungarians being a significant minority. The village was part of the ƒåakovec district () in the Kingdom of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920. It then became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the 1921 and 1931 censuses, the official name of the village was Kraljevec.

It was built by the architect Armando Brasini (1879-1965). Its construction began in 1923 with the design of a Greek cross inscribed in a circle with an articulated facade, and completed before 1936, the year in which it was made a parish church and granted to the Congregation of Missionary Sons of the Sacred Immaculate Heart of Mary, usually known as the Claretian Missionaries. A grand dome was planned, but never realized; a smaller drum was completed in 1951. In the baptistery there are modern paintings by the Armenian Gregorio Sciltian (1900-1985). Pope John XXIII elevated it to the rank of Minor Basilica in May 1959, and Pope Paul VI made it a titular church in February 1965, with √Ångel Herrera Oria as the first titular. The present titular priest is Julius Riyadi Darmaatmadja S.J., appointed in 1994.  Brief history  The construction of this church was entrusted by the Claretian Missionaries to the architect Armando Brasini after the transfer of land from the Holy See towards this purpose was accepted by their General Chapter in 1922. The foundation stone was laid in the month of July 1924. On October 21, 1934 the crypt was open for worship and the thanksgiving liturgy for the beatification of Saint Anthony Mary Claret was celebrated. On May 9, 1936 the new parish dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was inaugurated. The official opening of the church was done in the presence of the Cardinal Clemente Micara on December 7, 1952. In 1953 the Cardinal Clemente Micara celebrated in this church the Consecration of Rome to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In March 1959 the church was consecrated as a Minor Basilica. Finally, during the advent season of the year 1965 the Basilica was declared \\"Titolo Cardinalizio‚Äù. It was, and remains, the largest church, after the four great basilicas of Rome. Whoever looks at the plan of the church will be able to observe that the naves in the form of crosses are circumscribed by a hoop that forms like an aureole. It lacks the large dome foreseen in the project.  The outer portion  The church is set on a base surrounded by stairs and begins its ascent with a majestic Doric order, whose columns have a diameter of 1.50 m. which reach a height of nearly 12 m. On the main pediment it opens to a pronao surmounted by a double gable of austere form; the rhythm of this architectural order is broken only by a coat of arms of the Congregation of the Claretian Missionaries and a dedicatee as used to be found on the triumphal arches which reads in latin: TO GOD AND IN HONOR OF THE IMMACULATE HEART OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY, QUEEN OF THE PEACE, 1952. A large portico, where the three monumental doors are located gives access to the church, and on top one finds the coat of arms of the present Pope and that of the Congregation of the Claretian Missionaries. On the central door is found the motto: AVE COR MARIAE ESTO SALUS MUNDI (Hail Heart of Mary, be the salvation of the world). To the right, upwards, is an inscription regarding the inauguration of the church.  The inside of the Basilica  The basilica has a length of 94 m., is wide by 58 m. and is connected by a circular passage where four large chapels diagonally open themselves. The decoration of two of them (the Holy Sacrament and the Perpetual Suffrage) were completed by Brasini in the period between 1958 and 1963. The paintings on the nave are the works of Elena Virginia Costantinescu: The Madonna seen by evangelist Luke, Madonna seen by evangelist St. John, Maria Magdalene; and works of R. Merussi: Annunciation, Last Supper, Burial and Resurrection of the Lord. Two alternatives Ways of the Cross (2000): one is a work of Carlo Sismonda, painter and musician (2000), the other a copy of G. Vicentini.  The left corridor  Baptismal font: The Baptism of Christ (1960-1962), work of Gregor Sciltian (1900-1985) that testifies as exemplary expression of his magical realism. Also the monochrome of the angels tends to bring the viewer gradually to the greatest exploitation of the color in the Baptism of Jesus. First chapel: of the Perpetual Suffrage, decorated by the Brasini. Here one finds the Burial of the Lord (1959), work of F. M. Trombini. Altar of the Heart of Jesus, work of R. Merussi (1984). Second chapel: It is overseen by a painting of the Madonna of Pompei. The altar above is a work of the Berninian school. In the angles of the chapel there are the models of 4 Evangelists done by Brasini, originally intended to be sculpted in stone and put in the pinnacles of the facade of the Basilica. To the left is the tomb of the Cardinal Arturo Tabera, a Claretian missionary, who died in 1975. The stone, to the right, bears the dates of the consecration of Rome and of the world to the Heart of Mary (1953). At the entrance of the chapel are found two busts - to the right by Brasini, in marble, of Silvio Canevari (+1932), and on the left, that of Pious XII, in plaster, by L.M. Sibio (1969).  The main altar  Large mosaic of the Heart of Mary, patroness of the Basilica, work of the Vatican School, reproduction of the painting of the Jesuit Sebastiano Gall√©s (1870), surrounded by angels in bronze of Domenico Ponzi and by relics of saints. Behind it are seen the pipes of the church organ, of the factory of V. zo Mascioni (1954), Cuvio (Varese).  The right corridor  Altar of the Crucified One (XX s.). The inscription in latin: WE ADORE YOU, CHRIST, AND BLESS YOU BECAUSE WITH YOUR HOLY CROSS YOU REDEEMED THE WORLD. First Chapel: Mosaic of St. Joseph of the Vatican School, reproduction of a painting of Prof. Gaudenzi. To the left is the tomb of the Cardinal Arcadio M. Larraona, a Claretian Missionary, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, who died in 1973. Altar of St. Anthony M. Claret, work of R. Merussi (1984). It is followed in the intermediate space by the monument to the Martyrs of Barbastro (1992). Second Chapel: of the Blessed Sacrament, with altars and decoration by Brasini. In the stained-glass window (by J. Grau Garriga) the imagine of Saint Anthony M. Claret. On the top the inscription in latin: THIS IS THE BREAD OF ANGELS, MADE FOOD FOR PILGRIMS. WE ADORE ETERNALLY THE SACRAMENT.  The dome  The dome is an incomplete work. With its 23 m. it would have been the largest dome in Rome after that of the Vatican (42 m). The plastic model of the dome can be seen in the interior angle of the central right pillar. In the drum of the dome one reads this inscription in latin: WE ENTRUST AND CONSECRATE OURSELVES TO YOUR IMMACULATE HEART. (PIOUS XII).  The crypt  To the right corner of the entrance is the opening to the Presepe Monumentale (Monumental Crib), work of Fulgencio Mart√≠nez, situated in the older inferior crypt (11). In this crypt was the old parish before the inauguration of the Basilica. In it, among other events, were baptized a few members of the Spanish Royal Family, Mons. Oscar Romero, the martyr of El Salvador, celebrated his first Mass and was the place where Claretians celebrated the beatification of Saint Anthony Mary Claret.

Growing to tall by wide in a ball or oval shape, it is grey-green in colour with 7 to 9 prominent ribs, very long twisted spines and yellow flowers with a red centre in summer. The common name of goat's horn cactus corresponds to the species identifier capricorne (capri meaning ‚Äúgoat‚Äù and corne meaning ‚Äúhorn‚Äù) referring to the curved spines that are said to resemble a goat's horns. This species is designated as of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN as it is widely distributed in the Chihuahuan desert. Cultivation This species is grown, typically from seed, as an ornamental plant as it produces large, attractive yellow flowers with red central regions. Some cultivars bear white flecking on the plant body while others lack this feature. Though tolerant of cold temperatures, it must be grown in a warm, sheltered spot which does not freeze in winter. The soil should be poor, alkaline and very sharply drained. Alternatively it can be grown under glass in a pot with cactus compost.

Life Thornton was the son of Robert Thornton of Clapham, Surrey, a merchant who became a director of the Bank of England. He invested heavily in the Russian and Baltic trade and acquired wealth that he donated to Christian ministry causes. A devout Anglican, he espoused evangelical causes, regardless of denomination, and his extensive giving included evangelical ministries in various parts of the world. He is best known as having partly sponsored John Newton, the ex-slave ship trader who became an Anglican priest at Olney, Buckinghamshire from 1764 to 1780, giving him ¬£200 a year. In 1780, he offered Newton the living of St Mary Woolnoth, Lombard Street ‚Äì the fashionable London church where Newton became established as a noted preacher for over twenty years, and where he ended his days. He also aided Lady Huntingdon in setting up her training college with an interest-free loan. Thornton was the treasurer of a fund raised in England from 1766 to 1768 by American colonial preachers Samson Occom and Nathaniel Whitaker for Moor's School, an Indian charity school founded by Eleazar Wheelock in Lebanon Crank, Connecticut. Wheelock applied the fund to establish Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and in 1829 the school named one of its main buildings Thornton Hall. Thornton donated his own money so that Wheelock could build a mansion for the college president in 1771. It still stands at 4 West Wheelock Street. Thornton travelled extensively and contributed to churches in different parts of the country, including Holy Trinity, Clapham, which was to become the centre for the so- called Clapham Sect of Christian social reformers. On 28 November 1753 Thornton married Lucy Watson (1722-1785), daughter of Samuel Watson of Hull. They had four children, including Samuel Thornton (1754-1838) a Member of Parliament), and Henry Thornton (1760-1815), banker, economist and Member of Parliament.

By 1963, when Oudtshoorn's single-sex schools were amalgamated, the building was in such a state of disrepair that it was almost demolished. However, a petition by the school's alumni convinced the National Monuments Commission to withdraw this recommendation. The Education Department decided instead to sell the building. It was renamed in honour of Colonel CP Nel, who had bequeathed a valuable collection of antiques to the public. These antiques were transferred to the building in 1972, and the CP Nel Museum was officially opened. In 1979, the building was declared a national monument. A replica of an ostrich feather dealer's office at the museum. Present The school hall has been repurposed as the \\"Ostrich Hall\\" in order to exhibit the history of the ostrich in the Little Karoo's development. It includes in its displays a rock that has carved into it an image of running ostriches, which was discovered in the Sahara Desert. \\"Feather-boom fashions\\" are also on display. The museum also exhibits an early 20th-century pharmacy; a crockery collection; military history and weapons; musical instruments; and a garage of historical vehicles. The CP Nel Museum is one of a few secular museums in the world to house a synagogue. At the suggestion of Isidore Barron, who had been a member of the museum's Board of Trustees, the Jewish gallery was opened in 1973. This room is a reconstruction of the old St. John Street Synagogue as it was in 1896, and depicts the contribution of Oudtshoorn's Lithuanian Jewish community to the ostrich industry. The synagogue is still occasionally used for services. The ticket price includes admission to the Le Roux Townhouse, which is decorated in authentic Victorian-era furniture, and depicts a \\"feather palace\\" during the Ostrich booms. In 2014, the museum updated its material to recognise the historical forced removals of non-whites from Oudtshoorn, and made its explanatory notes available in English, Afrikaans, and Xhosa, the three official provincial languages of the Western Cape.  Architecture  The building is a specimen of late Victorian, Colonial-style architecture, and the hall is built in the New Republican style. The museum's 30-metre-high clock tower is adorned with Corinthian ornaments and is topped with a wrought-iron dome. The clock was made in England in 1902, and was transported in parts to Mossel Bay and then over the Outeniqua Mountains via ox-wagon. It had been ordered by Oudtshoorn resident Pierre Olivier in 1904, who decided to donate it to what was then the local boys' school. The clock was built into the tower in 1907. The building's sandstone facade is considered one of the finest examples of stone masonry in the Little Karoo. Willem Adriaan Cruywagen, the Minister of National Education who declared the building a national monument, gave the following reasoning for the certification: Further readinghttp://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/bldgframes.php?bldgid=3248 *Bakker, Karel A, Clarke, Nicholas J & Fisher, Roger C. 2014.

It was also the last studio album he made with The Blockheads, until 1998's Mr. Love Pants, though a live album Warts 'n' Audience was produced in 1991.  History  The Blockheads had undergone a significant personnel change since the previous album, Do It Yourself. Chaz Jankel, who played keyboards and co-wrote most of that album's songs, had left in the wake of a stressful tour. Jankel's place on guitar was taken by Wilko Johnson of Dr. Feelgood. Johnson (real name John Wilkinson) had considered retiring from the music business until he was asked by Davey Payne and Dury, old friends from their pub rock days, to join The Blockheads. The new-line up first appeared on the 'I Want To Be Straight' single, which was released before the album, and reached number 22 in the UK pop charts. Although Ian Dury was becoming harder to work with, the production of Laughter had started out as a relaxed affair, without the presence of Jankel and Dury. Rehearsals commenced in early 1980 at Milner Sound in Fulham, after keyboard player Mick Gallagher had returned from an American tour with The Clash. The group was, at that time, on hiatus after the gruelling promotional tour in support of Do It Yourself. Spurred on by recording commitments, Dury took over the rehearsals to form the basis of his new album and brought in Wilko Johnson, all without consulting the rest of the band. At that time Dury was an alcoholic, and also addicted to Mogadon, a brand of sedative. Coupled with his bad reaction to celebrity, and his bouts of depression, these addictions caused him to be cantankerous, confrontational, argumentative and controlling. Although these traits had come out during the recording of the group's previous album, they were at their peak during the record sessions for Laughter. Attempts to question Dury's judgment would cause explosions of defensiveness and aggression. He also insisted on synchronising the instruments to a click-track, which aggravated a number of the musicians, especially Wilko Johnson. To make matters worse, guitarist Johnny Turnbull suffered a head injury and was afflicted with mood swings. He eventually had a nervous breakdown. The album was preceded by the single \\"Sueperman's Big Sister\\", intentionally spelt wrong so to avoid any copyright issues with DC Comics. The 7\\" release included an exclusive track \\"You'll See Glimpses\\", while the 12\\" included the album's final track \\"Fucking Ada\\". The single, Stiff Records' 100th, employed the label for Stiff's very first (Nick Lowe's \\"Heart of the City\\") with the track names crossed out and the correct titles and artist (for \\"Sueperman's Big Sister\\") written in, as if by biro. Laughter was released the same month, November 1980, but the album was not well received by critics and its sales were mediocre. The \\"Soft As a Baby's Bottom\\" tour to support it, however, was a sell-out success. Stiff and Ian Dury parted ways afterwards and he signed a short-lived deal with Polydor Records without The Blockheads. Style A number of Laughter's songs appear to deal with Dury's personal problems and demons. Although he always denied that \\"Delusions Of Grandeur\\" was about himself, most who knew him at the time felt certain it was. Others, such as \\"Uncoolohol\\" (about alcoholism), \\"Manic Depression (Jimi)\\" and \\"Fucking Ada\\" (both about depression) also seem to make clear references to his troubles at the time. \\"Hey, Hey, Take Me Away\\" is confirmed to have been about the time he spent at Chailey's Special School while stricken with polio. In an interview years later, Dury admitted of the album: \\"I called it Laughter to cheer myself up.\\" Track listing Bonus tracks (Edsel 2-CD edition) Personnel *Ian Dury - vocals ;The Blockheads *Wilko Johnson - guitars, backing vocals *Johnny Turnbull - guitars, backing vocals *Mick Gallagher - keyboards, synthesisers *Norman Watt-Roy - bass *Charley Charles - drums *Davey Payne - saxophones, harmonica, flute ;Additional Personnel *Don Cherry - pocket trumpet *Will Gaines - tap dance on \\"Dance of the Crackpots\\" *Ray Cooper - percussion *Ivor Raymonde - strings ;Technical *Ian Horne - sound engineer, mixing *Richard Wernham - assistant engineer *Chris Killip - photography *Ray Gregory, Brain Love - album design Re-releases The album was re-released by Edsel Records in 2004 as part of a series of 2-CD Ian Dury re-issues. Previously the album had been re-issued to CD by Demon Records, initially with no bonus tracks then with the addition of \\"Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3\\" - a song that had no real relation to the album and featured a different band line-up. Edsel's 2004 re-issue replaced the track with \\"I Want To be Straight\\" and \\"That's Not All\\", both sides of the first single with the Blockheads line-up that recorded the album and \\"Superman's Big Sister's\\" B-side \\"You'll See Glimpses\\". Edsel's re-issue also included a bonus disc of mainly instrumentals mostly recorded by The Blockheads before Dury became involved with the project and three songs, including the final version of \\"Duff 'Em Up and Do 'Em Over (Boogie Woogie)\\" the song \\"Oh Mr. Peanut\\" began life as. Despite being considered of good quality, Dury and Stiff compere Kosmo Vinyl were worried it might become an anthem for football hooligans or the small percentage of yob culture that followed him and bands like Sham 69 and Dury scrapped the lyric.

This traditional style commonly used to brew tea originated in China, dating back to the 15th century, and are made from clay produced near Yixing in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu. History Archaeological excavations reveal that as early as the Song dynasty (10th century) potters near Yixing were using local \\"zisha\\" (Á¥´Á†Ç or Á¥´Ê≥• ; literally, \\"purple sand/clay\\") to make utensils that may have functioned as teapots. According to the Ming dynasty author Zhou Gaoqi, during the reign of the Zhengde Emperor, a monk from Jinsha Temple (Golden Sand Temple) in Yixing handcrafted a fine quality teapot from local clay. Such teapots soon became popular with the scholarly class, and the fame of Yixing teapots began to spread. 20th century Y√≠xƒ´ng teapots are actually made in nearby Dƒ´ngshƒÅn, also known as Dingshu, Introducing Dƒ´ngshƒÅn from Lonely Planet. on the west side of Lake Tai.Introducing Lake Tai from Lonely Planet. Hundreds of teapot shops line the edges of the town's crowded streets and it is a popular tourist destination for many Chinese. While Dƒ´ngshƒÅn is home to dozens of ceramics factories, Y√≠xƒ´ng Z«êshƒÅ Factory Number 1, which opened in 1958, processes a large part of the clay used in the region, produces fine pottery ware, and has a large commercial showroom. In addition to the better known teapots, tea pets, oil and grain jars, flower vases, figurines, glazed tiles, tables, ornamental rocks, and even ornamental waste bins are all manufactured in the community. Use with tea Five Yixing clay teapots, in styles from formal to whimsical. Yixing teapots are intended for puer, black, and oolong teas. They can also be used for green or white teas, however, the heat retention characteristics of Yixing makes the brewing process extremely difficult; and in such cases, the water must be heated to no greater than , before pouring into the teapot. A famous characteristic of Yixing teapots are their ability to absorb trace amounts of brewed tea flavors and minerals into the teapot with each brewing. Over time, these accumulate to give each Yixing teapot its own unique interior coating that flavors and colors future brewings. It is for this reason that soap is not recommended for cleaning Yixing teapots, but instead, fresh distilled water and air drying. Many tea connoisseurs will steep only one type of tea in a particular Yixing teapot, so that future brewings of the same type of tea will be optimally enhanced. In contrast, brewing many different types of tea in a Yixing pot is likely to create a coating of mishmashed flavors that muddy the taste of future brewings. Yixing teapots are smaller than their western counterparts as the tea is often brewed using the gongfu style of brewing: shorter steeping durations with smaller amounts of water and smaller teacups (compared to western-style brewing). Traditionally, the tea from the teapot is poured into either a small pitcher, from which it is then poured into a teacup that holds approximately 30 ml or less of liquid, allowing the tea to be quickly and repeatedly ingested before it becomes cooled, or into several teacups for guests. Price Prices can vary from a couple dozen to thousands of yuan. A pot was auctioned in 2010 for 12.32 million yuan. Generally, the price of Yixing teapots are dependent on such factors such as age, clay, artist, style and production methods. The more expensive pots are shaped by hand using wooden and bamboo tools to manipulate the clay into form, while cheaper Yixing pots are produced by slipcasting. References Further reading * K.S.

The remains are a scheduled ancient monument and are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. They are considered to be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire. The priory was established as an Augustinian foundation in the 12th century, and was raised to the status of an abbey in 1391. The abbey was closed in 1536, as part of the dissolution of the monasteries. Nine years later the surviving structures, together with the manor of Norton, were purchased by Sir Richard Brooke, who built a Tudor house on the site, incorporating part of the abbey. This was replaced in the 18th century by a Georgian house. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was partially demolished in 1928. In 1966 the site was given in trust for the use of the general public. Excavation of the site began in 1971, and became the largest to be carried out by modern methods on any European monastic site. It revealed the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of Saint Christopher. The priory was opened to the public as a visitor attraction in the 1970s. The 42-acre site, run by an independent charitable trust, includes a museum, the excavated ruins, and the surrounding garden and woodland. In 1984 the separate walled garden was redesigned and opened to the public. Norton Priory offers a programme of events, exhibitions, educational courses, and outreach projects. In August 2016, a larger and much extended museum opened. History Priory In 1115 a community of Augustinian canons was founded in the burh of Runcorn by William fitz Nigel, the second Baron of Halton and Constable of Chester, on the south bank of the River Mersey where it narrows to form the Runcorn Gap. This was the only practical site where the Mersey could be crossed between Warrington and Birkenhead, and the archaeologists Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis consider it likely that the canons cared for travellers and pilgrims crossing the river. They also speculate that William may have sought to profit from the tolls paid by these travellers. The priory was the second religious house to be founded in the Earldom of Chester; the first was the Benedictine St Werburgh's Abbey at Chester, founded in 1093 by Hugh Lupus, the first Earl of Chester. The priory at Runcorn had a double dedication, to Saint Bertelin and to Saint Mary. The authors of the Victoria County History suggest that the dedication to St Bertelin was taken from a Saxon church already existing on the site. In 1134 William fitz William, the third Baron of Halton, moved the priory to a site in Norton, a village to the east of Runcorn. The reasons for the move are uncertain. It may have been that fitz William wanted greater control of the strategic crossing of the Mersey at Runcorn Gap, or it may have been because the canons wanted a more secluded site. Nothing remains of the site of the original priory in Runcorn. Plan of the priory in the 12th century (left) and 13th century (right).

Asterisk denotes buildings of similar function in a different later location The site for the new priory was in damp, scrubby woodland. There is no evidence that it was agricultural land, or that it contained any earlier buildings. The first priority was to clear and drain the land. There were freshwater springs near the site, and these would have provided fresh running water for latrines and domestic purposes. They would also have been used to create watercourses and moated enclosures, some of which might have been used for orchards and herb gardens. Sandstone for building the priory was available at an outcrop nearby, sand for mortar could be obtained from the shores of the River Mersey, and boulder clay on the site provided material for floor and roof tiles. Excavation has revealed remnants of oak, some of it from trees hundreds of years old. It is likely that this came from various sources; some from nearby, and some donated from the forests at Delamere and Macclesfield. The church and monastic buildings were constructed in Romanesque style. The priory was endowed by William fitz Nigel with properties in Cheshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Oxfordshire, including the churches of St Mary, Great Budworth and St Michael, Chester. By 1195 the priory owned eight churches, five houses, the tithe of at least eight mills, the rights of common in four townships, and one-tenth of the profits from the Runcorn ferry. The prior supplied the chaplain to the hereditary Constables of Chester and to the Barons of Halton. During the 12th century, the main benefactors of the priory were the Barons of Halton, but after 1200 their gifts reduced, mainly because they transferred their interests to the Cistercian abbey at Stanlow, which had been founded in 1178 by John fitz Richard, the sixth baron. Archaeologist J. Patrick Greene states that it is unlikely that any of the Barons of Halton were buried in Norton Priory. The only members of the family known to be buried there are Richard, brother of Roger de Lacy, the seventh baron, and a female named Alice. The identity of Alice has not been confirmed, but Greene considers that she was the niece of William, Earl Warenne, the 5th Earl of Surrey and therefore a relative of the Delacy family, who were at that time the Barons of Halton. The earl made a grant to the priory of 30 shillings a year in order to \\"maintain a pittance for her soul\\". As the role played by the Barons of Halton declined, so the importance of members of the Dutton family increased. The Duttons had been benefactors since the priory's foundation, and from the 13th century they became the principal benefactors. There were two main branches of the family, one in Dutton and the other in Sutton Weaver. The Dutton family had their own burial chapel in the priory, and burial in the chapel is specified in three wills made by members of the family. The Aston family of Aston were also important benefactors. The priory buildings, including the church, were extended during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. It has been estimated that the original community would have consisted of 12 canons and the prior; this increased to around 26 members in the later part of the 12th century, making it one of the largest houses in the Augustinian order. By the end of the century the church had been lengthened, a new and larger chapter house had been built (I* on the plan), and a large chapel had been added to the east end of the church (N). In about 1200 the west front of the church was enlarged (M), a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed. It is possible that the chapel at the east end was built to accommodate the holy cross of Norton, a relic which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers. A fire in 1236 destroyed the timber-built kitchen (Q) and damaged the west range of the monastic buildings and the roof of the church. The kitchen was rebuilt and the other damage was rapidly repaired. Abbey During the first half of the 14th century, the priory suffered from financial mismanagement and disputes with the Dutton family, exacerbated by a severe flood in 1331 that reduced the income from the priory's lands. The direct effects of the Black Death are not known, but during the 1350s financial problems continued. These were party mitigated with the selling of the advowson of the church at Ratcliffe-on-Soar. Matters further improved from 1366 with the appointment of Richard Wyche as prior. He was active in the governance of the wider Augustinian order and in political affairs, and in 1391 was involved in raising the priory's status to that of a mitred abbey. A mitred abbey was one in which the abbot was given permission to use pontifical insignia, including the mitre, ring and pontifical staff, and to give the solemn benediction provided a bishop was not present. It was rare for an Augustinian house to be elevated to this status. Out of about 200 Augustinian houses in England and Wales, 28 were abbeys and only seven of these became mitred. The only other mitred abbey in Cheshire was that of St Werburgh in Chester. In 1379 and in 1381 there were 15 canons at Norton and in 1401 there were 16, making it the largest Augustinian community in the northwest of England. By this time the barony of Halton had passed by a series of marriages to the duchy of Lancaster. John of Gaunt, the 1st Duke of Lancaster and 14th Baron of Halton, agreed to be the patron of the newly formed abbey. At this date the church was long; it was the second longest Augustinian church in northwest England, exceeded only by the long church at Carlisle. Towards the end of the 14th century, the abbey acquired a \\"giant\\" statue of Saint Christopher. Three wills from members of the Dutton family from this period survive; they are dated 1392, 1442 and 1527, and in each will money was bequeathed to the foundation. alt=An abbey model seen from an elevated position from the southeast The abbey's fortunes went into decline after the death of Richard Wyche in 1400. Wyche was succeeded by his prior, John Shrewsbury, who \\"does not seem to have done more than keep the house in order\\". Frequent floods had reduced its income, and in 1429 the church and other abbey buildings were described as being \\"ruinous\\". Problems continued through the rest of the 15th century, resulting in the sale of more advowsons. By 1496 the number of canons had been reduced to nine, and to seven in 1524. In 1522 there were reports of disputes between the abbot and the prior. The abbot was accused of \\"wasting the house's resources, nepotism, relations with women\\" and other matters, while the prior admitted to \\"fornication and lapses in the observation of the Rule\\". The prior threatened the abbot with a knife, but then left the abbey. The physical state of the buildings continued to deteriorate. The records of the priory and abbey have not survived, but the excavations and the study of other documents have produced evidence of how the monastic lands were managed. The principal source of income came from farming. This income was required not only for the building and upkeep of the property, but also for feeding the canons, their guests, and visiting pilgrims. The priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording the Mersey. It has been estimated that nearly half of the demesne lands were used for arable farming. The grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside the priory lands. Excavations revealed part of a stone handmill in the area used in the monastic kitchen. In addition to orchards and herb gardens in the moated enclosures, it is likely that beehives were maintained for the production of honey. There is evidence from bone fragments that cattle, sheep, pigs, geese and chickens were reared and consumed, but few bone fragments from deer, rabbits or hares have been discovered. Horseflesh was not eaten. Although few fish bones have been discovered, it is known from documentary evidence that the canons owned a number of local fisheries. The fuel used consisted of wood and charcoal, and turf from marshes over which the priory had rights of turbary (to cut turf). The events in 1536 surrounding the fate of the abbey at the dissolution of the monasteries are complicated, and included a dispute between Sir Piers Dutton, who was in a powerful position as the Sheriff of Cheshire, and Sir William Brereton, the deputy-chamberlain of Chester. Dutton's estate was next to that of the abbey, and Dutton plotted to gain some of its land from the Crown after the dissolution; while Brereton supported the abbot against Dutton and held the lucrative position of steward of the abbey. A campaign of vilification was directed at the canons, asserting that they were guilty of \\"debauched conduct\\". Then, in 1535, Dutton falsely accused the abbot and Brereton of issuing counterfeit coins. This charge was dismissed mainly because one of Dutton's witnesses was considered to be \\"unconvincing\\". Playing into Duttons' hands was the gross undervaluation of the abbey's assets as reported to the royal commissioners of the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535; as a result of which the net annual income of the abbey was recorded, falsely, as falling below the ¬£200 () threshold that would subsequently be chosen for the first round of dissolutions in 1536, although whether this subterfuge was due to the machinations of Dutton or the abbot (or both) remains unclear. Brereton and the abbot appear to have attempted to have the dissolution cancelled subject to the payment of a fine, as was the case in large numbers of other houses in similar circumstances; but in the abbot's absence dissolution commissioners arrived unannounced at the abbey in early October 1536. There was considerable opposition, the commissioners being menaced by around 300 local people; for whom the abbot, rushing back, threw an impromptu feast complete with roasted ox. According to Dutton's account, after barricading themselves in a tower the commissioners managed to send a letter to Dutton, who arrived with a force of men in the middle of the night. Most of the rioters fled, but Dutton arrested the abbot and four of the canons, who were sent to Halton Castle and then to prison in Chester. Dutton sent a report of the events to Henry VIII; who demanded that if the abbot and canons had behaved as Dutton reported, they should be immediately executed as traitors. However, because the kings instructions had been conveyed by the Lord Chancellor in the form of letters to both Dutton and Brereton, the two faction leaders would be required to act together to effect them; with the consequence that Brereton was temporarily able to stall any such action by refusing to meet with Dutton. Events elsewhere in the country further delayed the execution and, following an intercession to Thomas Cromwell (whose own informal contacts had cast doubt on the reliability of Dutton's reports), the abbot and canons were discharged and awarded pensions. The abbey was made uninhabitable, the lead from the roof, the bell metal, and other valuable materials were confiscated for the king, and the building lay empty for nine years. The estate came into the ownership of the Crown, and it was managed by Brereton. From the evidence of damage to the tiled floor of the church, Brown and Howard-Davis conclude it is likely that the church was demolished at an early stage, but otherwise the archaeological evidence for this period is sparse and largely negative. Country house alt=A courtyard showing a range at the back that includes a tower, a stairway leading to an arched entrance, and a range of half- timbered buildings. On the left side is a towered gateway and a narrow turret; to the right is a two-storey building with battlements, and a stair turret. In 1545 the abbey and the manor of Norton were sold to Sir Richard Brooke for a little over ¬£1,512 (). Brooke built a house in Tudor style, which became known as Norton Hall, using as its core the former abbot's lodgings and the west range of the monastic buildings. It is not certain which other monastic buildings remained when the abbey was bought by the Brookes; excavations suggest that the cloisters were still present. A 17th-century sketch plan by one of the Randle Holme family shows that the gatehouse remained at that time, although almost all the church had been demolished. An engraving by the Buck brothers dated 1727 shows that little changed by the next century. During the Civil War the house was attacked by a force of Royalists. The Brookes were the first family in north Cheshire to declare allegiance to the Parliamentary side. Halton Castle was a short distance away, and was held by Earl Rivers for the Royalists. In February 1643 a large force from the castle armed with cannon attacked the house, which was defended by only 80 men. Henry Brooke successfully defended the house, with only one man wounded, while the Royalists lost 16 men including their cannonier (gunner). They burnt two barns and plundered Brooke's tenants, but \\"returned home with shame and the hatred of the country\\". alt=A house seen from an angle. The main front has nine bays, the central three of which protrude forward, and a double staircase leads to the main entrance on the first floor. Sheep graze in the foreground. At some time between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was demolished and replaced by a new house in Georgian style. The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right- angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former vaulted undercroft of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of wines and beers. The first floor was the piano nobile, containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs leading up to the main entrance.Morriss, R. in Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating. Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing.Morriss, R. in According to the authors of the Buildings of England series, the architect responsible for this was James Wyatt. Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a walled garden at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers. The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden. Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, and barrel vaulting was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its arcade.Morriss, R. in During the mid-18th century, Sir Richard Brooke was involved in a campaign to prevent the Bridgewater Canal from being built through his estate. The Bridgewater Canal Extension Act had been passed in 1762, and it made allowances for limited disturbance to the Norton estate. However Sir Richard did not see the necessity for the canal and opposed its passing through his estate. In 1773 the canal was opened from Manchester to Runcorn, except for across the estate, which meant that goods had to be unloaded and carted around it. Eventually Sir Richard capitulated, and the canal was completed throughout its length by March 1776. alt=Two brick-built arched wine bins, each divided into four sections, the lower ones being larger than the upper By 1853 a service range had been added to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the external flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed to the north of the Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.Morriss, R. in During the 19th century the estate was again affected by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this cut off the northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and the northern part of the estate could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current Sir Richard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust for the benefit of the public. Excavations and museum In 1971 J. Patrick Greene was given a contract to carry out a six-month excavation for Runcorn Development Corporation as part of a plan to develop a park in the centre of Runcorn New Town. The site consisted of a area of fields and woods to the north of the Bridgewater Canal. Greene's initial findings led to his being employed for a further 12 years to supervise a major excavation of the site. The buildings found included the Norman doorway with its Victorian addition and three medieval rooms. Specialists were employed and local volunteers were recruited to assist with the excavation, while teams of supervised prisoners were used to perform some of the heavier work. The area excavated exceeded that at any European monastic site that used modern methods. The Development Corporation decided to create a museum on the site, and in 1975 Norton Priory Museum Trust was established. In 1989 Greene published his book about the excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House. Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum, in which the findings are described in more detail. Howard-Davis was largely responsible for the post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artefacts and, with Brown, for their analysis. Findings from excavations Priory 1134‚Äì1236 The excavations have revealed information about the original priory buildings and grounds, and how they were subsequently modified. A series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site. Evidence of the earliest temporary timber buildings in which the canons were originally housed was found in the form of 12th-century post pits. Norton Priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters. The remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered. It is considered that the largest of these, because it had more substantial foundations than the others, was probably the timber-framed church; another was most likely the gatehouse, and the other buildings provided accommodation for the canons and the senior secular craftsmen. alt=A highly decorated arched Norman doorway with a further, lower, arch beyond leading to a room with a window containing stained glass. The earliest masonry building was the church, which was constructed on shallow foundations of sandstone rubble and pebbles on boulder clay. The walls were built in local red sandstone with ashlar faces and a rubble and mortar core. The ground plan of the original church was cruciform, and consisted of a nave without aisles, a choir at the crossing with a tower above it, a square-ended chancel, and north and south transepts, each with an eastern chapel. The total length of the church was and the total length across the transepts was , giving a ratio of 2:1. The walls of the church were wide at the base, and the crossing tower was supported on four piers. The other early buildings were built surrounding a cloister to the south of the church. The east range incorporated the chapter house and also contained the sacristy, the canons' dormitory and the reredorter. The upper storey of the west range provided living accommodation for the prior and an area where secular visitors could be received. In the lower storey was the undercroft where food and fuel were stored. The south range contained the refectory, and at a distance from the south range stood the kitchen. Evidence of a bell foundry dating from this period was found to the north of the church. It is likely that this was used for casting a tenor bell. A few moulded stones from this early period were found. These included nine blocks that probably formed part of a corbel table. There were also two beak-head voussoirs; this type of voussoir is rare in Cheshire, and has been found in only one other church in the county. Considerable expansion occurred during the last two decades of the 12th century and the first two or three decades of the 13th century. The south and west ranges were demolished and rebuilt, enlarging the cloister from about by to about by . This meant that a door in the south wall of the church had to be blocked off and a new highly decorated doorway was built at the northeast corner of the cloister; this doorway has survived. The lower storey of the west range, the other standing remains of the priory, also dates from this period; it comprises the cellarer's undercroft and a passage to its north, known as the outer parlour. The outer parlour had been the entrance to the priory from the outside world, and was \\"sumptuously decorated\\" so that \\"the power and wealth of the priory could be displayed in tangible fashion to those coming from the secular world\\". The undercroft, used for storage, was divided into two chambers, and its decoration was much plainer. The upper floor has been lost; it is considered that this contained the prior's living quarters and, possibly, a chapel over the outer parlour. A new and larger reredorter was built at the end of the east range, and it is believed that work might have started on a new chapter house. A system of stone drains was constructed to replace the previous open ditches. The west wall of the church was demolished and replaced by a more massive structure, thick at the base. The east wall was also demolished and the chancel was extended, forming an additional area measuring approximately by . Priory and abbey 1236‚Äì1536 The excavation revealed evidence of the fire of 1236, including ash, charcoal, burnt planks and a burnt wooden bowl. It is thought that the fire probably started in the timber- built kitchens at the junction of the west and south ranges, and then spread to the monastic buildings and church. Most of the wood in the buildings, including the furnishings and roofs, would have been destroyed, although the masonry walls remained largely intact. The major repairs required gave an opportunity for the extension of the church by the addition of new chapels to both of the transepts, and its refurbishment in a manner even grander than previously. The cloister had been badly damaged in the fire and its arcade was rebuilt on the previous foundations. The new arcade was of \\"very high quality and finely wrought construction\\". Brown and Howard-Davis state that the kitchens were rebuilt on the same site and it appears that they were rebuilt in timber yet again. Excavations have found evidence of a second bell foundry in the northwest of the priory grounds. The date of this is uncertain but Greene suggests that it was built to cast a new bell to replace the original one that was damaged in the fire. Later in the 13th century another chapel was added to the north transept. Accommodation for guests was constructed to the southwest of the monastic buildings. In the later part of the 13th century and during the following century the chapel in the south transept was replaced by a grander two-chambered chapel. This balanced the enlarged chapels in the north transept, restoring the church's cruciform plan. Around this time the east end of the church was further extended when a reliquary chapel was added measuring about by . A guest hall was built to the west of the earlier guest quarters. After the status of the foundation was elevated from a priory to an abbey, a tower house was added to the west range. This is shown on the engraving by the Buck brothers, but it has left little in the way of archaeological remains. The church was extended by the addition of a north aisle. There is little evidence of later major alterations before the dissolution. There is evidence to suggest that the cloister was rebuilt, and that alterations were made to the east range. Burials alt=Two open stone coffins lying at an angle to each other, the one in the foreground being badly cracked. In front of them is the lower part of the trunk of a tree. The excavations revealed information about the burials carried out within the church and the monastic buildings, and in the surrounding grounds. They are considered to be \\"either those of Augustinian canons, privileged members of their lay household, or of important members of the Dutton family\\". Most burials were in stone coffins or in wooden coffins with stone lids, and had been carried out from the late 12th century up to the time of the dissolution. The site of the burial depended on the status of the individual, whether they were clerical or lay, and their degree of importance. Priors, abbots, and high-ranking canons were buried within the church, with those towards the east end of the church being the most important. Other canons were buried in a graveyard outside the church, in an area to the south and east of the chancel. Members of the laity were buried either in the church, towards the west end of the nave or in the north aisle, or outside the church around its west end. It is possible that there was a lay cemetery to the north and west of the church. The addition of the chapels to the north transept, and their expansion, was carried out for the Dutton family, making it their burial chapel, or family mausoleum,Butler, Lawrence, in and the highest concentration of burials was found in this part of the church. It is considered that the north aisle, built after the priory became an abbey, was added to provide a burial place for members of the laity. The excavations revealed 49 stone coffins, 30 coffin lids, and five headstones. Twelve of the lids were carved in high relief, with designs including flowers or foliage. One lid depicts an oak tree issuing from a human head in the style of a green man, another has a cross, a dragon and a female effigy, while others have shield and sword motifs. Two contain inscriptions in Norman-French, identifying the deceased. The remaining lids have simpler incised patterns, mainly decorated crosses. The headstones contain crosses.Butler, Lawrence, in Most of the coffins were sunk into the ground, with the lid at the level of the floor, although a few were found within the walls. Only three stone coffins for children were discovered. These lay in a group, together with a coffin containing a male skeleton, in the vestibule leading to the enlarged chapter house. The most prestigious type of coffin was tapered towards the feet, with the head end carved externally to a hemi-hexagonal shape. Another sign of higher status was the provision of an internal \\"pillow\\" for the head.Butler, Lawrence, in alt=Five tapering coffin lids and a circular object. All are carved with a variety of types of decorated crosses. A total of 144 graves was excavated; they contained 130 articulated skeletons in a suitable condition for examination.Boylston, Anthea, in Of these, 36 were well-preserved, 48 were in a fair condition and 46 were poorly preserved.Boylston, Anthea, in Males out-numbered females by a ratio of three to one, an expected ratio in a monastic site. Most of the males had survived into middle age (36‚Äì45 years) to old age (46 years or older), while equal numbers of females died before and after the age of about 45 years. One female death was presumably due to a complication of pregnancy as she had been carrying a 34-week foetus.Boylston, Anthea, in The average height of the adult males was and that of the adult females was .Boylston, Anthea, in The bones show a variety of diseases and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans).Boylston, Anthea, in The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight.Boylston, Anthea, in One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet.Boylston, Anthea, in No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs.Boylston, Anthea, in The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19 skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae.Boylston, Anthea, in Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases.Boylston, Anthea, in One cranium contained a large circular lesion which may have been the consequence of trepanning.Boylston, Anthea, in Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy.Boylston, Anthea, in Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women.Boylston, Anthea, in Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.Boylston, Anthea, in Examination of the jaws and teeth gave information about the dental health of those buried in the priory. The degree of wear of teeth was greater than it is at present, while the incidence of dental caries was much lower than it is now, as was the incidence of periodontal disease. A consequence of the wear of the teeth was \\"compensatory eruption\\" of the teeth in order to keep contact with the opposing teeth. It was concluded that the people buried in the priory had few problems with their teeth or jaws. Loss of teeth was due to wear of the teeth, rather than from caries or periodontal disease.Ogden, Alan, in Country house Little archaeological evidence relates to the period immediately after the dissolution, or to the Tudor house built on part of the site. A sawpit was found in the outer courtyard. It is considered that this might date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of the abbey. The kitchens to the south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family. The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as middens. Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front,Morriss, R. in and the foundations of the north wing. The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman doorway and Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.Johnson, Nick. in Artefacts from the buildings alt=An array of tiles of differing shapes and colours A large number of tiles and tile fragments that had lined the floor of the church and some of the monastic buildings were found in the excavations.Keen, Laurence in The oldest tiles date from the early 14th century. The total area of tiles discovered was about , and is \\"the largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation\\". The site has \\"the largest, and most varied, excavated collection of medieval tiles in the North West\\" and \\"the greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in Britain\\".Keen, Laurence in The tiles found made a pavement forming the floor of the choir of the church and the transepts. The chancel floor was probably also tiled; these tiles have not survived because the chancel was at a higher level than the rest of the church, and the tiles would have been removed during subsequent gardening. A dump of tiles to the south of the site of the chapter house suggests that this was also tiled. In the 15th century a second tile floor was laid on top of the original floor in the choir where it had become worn. The tiles on the original floor were of various shapes, forming a mosaic. The tiles were all glazed and coloured, the main colours being black, green and yellow. Many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into the moist clay before it was fired; these are known as line-impressed tiles. The line-impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals, rosettes, and trefoils.Keen, Laurence in Other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees, foliage, birds and inscriptions.Keen, Laurence in In the chapels of the north transept, the burial place of the Dutton family, were tiles depicting mail, thought to be part of a military effigy, and tiles bearing fragments of heraldic designs.Keen, Laurence in The tiles from the upper (later) pavement were all square, and again were line-inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs.Keen, Laurence in A related discovery at the excavation was the kiln in which most of the tiles on the site were fired. Capital and spandrel from reconstructed arcade in the museum|alt=The top of a column and base of two arches. In the spandrel is a carving of an otter-like creature; the capital is decorated with a carved head and foliage The excavations also revealed stones or fragments of carved stone dating from the 12th to the 16th centuries.Harrison, Stuart in The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12th century are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and a portion of the tracery from a rose window.Harrison, Stuart in Many of the stones from the 13th century were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re- used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter.Harrison, Stuart in There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads.Harrison, Stuart in Over 1,500 fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300 fragments of glass from later periods,Vose, Ruth Hurst in and nearly 1,150 sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.Dawson, Jo, with McPhillips, Sean in Artefacts from daily life Some 500 fragments of pottery were found dating from the medieval period. Most of these were parts of jars, jugs or pipkins and were found in the area of the kitchen range. Most of it was produced locally, although 13 sherds of Stamford Ware, fragments of two jugs from North France, and two small pieces of Saintonge pottery have been identified. Only a few wooden bowls were recovered.Vaughan, Jenny in Much more pottery was found dating from the post-medieval period and later. Again most of this had been manufactured in England, especially in Staffordshire. Fragments of pottery from abroad included pieces from a Westerwald mug, a jug from Cologne and items of Chinese porcelain. The excavations produced over 4,000 sherds of glass, dating from the 12th to the 20th centuries, but only 16 of these came from the period before the dissolution.Vose, Ruth Hurst in A total of 1,170 fragments from clay tobacco pipes were found, dating from about 1580 to the early 20th century.Davey, Peter J. in Six medieval coins were recovered, the earliest of which was a silver penny of John from the early 13th century. Coins from later periods were a silver threepence from the reign of Elizabeth I and a silver penny from Charles I. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18th century and later, including a 10-pfennig piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from copper alloy were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (scabbard tip), and part of a skimmer that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel spurs (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12 horseshoes. Nearly 2,000 fragments of lead were found, 940 of which were droplets of melted metal, some of these being a consequence of the fire in 1236. One of the earliest artefacts was a papal bulla dating from the rule of Pope Clement III (1187‚Äì91). Two other possible seals were discovered. A total of 15 lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artefacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in leaded windows), ventilator grills, and water pipes. Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17th century. Another find was a small gemstone, a cabochon (polished) sardonyx.Howard-Davis, Christine and Bowden, Alan in Present day Norton Priory is considered to be \\"a monastic site of international importance\\" and is \\"the most extensively excavated monastic site in Britain, if not Western Europe\\". It is open to the public and run by a charitable trust, the Norton Priory Museum Trust. The Trust was founded in 1975 and the first museum was opened in 1982; a much enlarged museum was built and opened in 2016. The Trust owns and maintains many of the artefacts found during the excavations, and has created an electronic database to record all the acquisitions. In addition, it holds records relating to the excavations, including site notebooks and photographs. The area open to the public consists of a museum, the standing archaeological remains, 42 acres of garden and woodland, and the walled garden of the former house. Museum The museum contains information relating to the history of the site and some of the artefacts discovered during the excavations. These include carved coffin lids, medieval mosaic tiles, pottery, scribe's writing equipment and domestic items from the various buildings on the site such as buttons, combs and wig curlers. Two medieval skeletons recovered in the excavations are on display, including one showing signs of Paget's disease of bone. Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of moulded pointed arches with springer blocks, voussoirs and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate capitals and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of human and animal heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one spandrel is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake. The museum contains the medieval sandstone statue of Saint Christopher, which is considered to be \\"a work of national and even international importance\\".Marrow, D. J. in Saint Christopher was associated with the abbey because of its proximity to the River Mersey and the dangers associated with crossing the river. The statue shows the saint wading through fish-filled water carrying the Christ-child on his shoulder.Marrow D. J. in It has been dated to about 1390, it is tall, and was once painted in bright colours.Marrow, D. J. in The gallery also contains a three-dimensional representation of the statue as it is believed it would have originally appeared. Archaeological remains alt=A blind arcade seen from an angle showing four round-headed arches supported on columns with carved capitals; a bench runs along the base The archaeological remains are recognised as a Grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument, and are considered to be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire. They consist of the former undercroft and the foundations of the church and monastic buildings that were exposed during the excavations. The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of bays divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the portico added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in Norman style. The doorway to the right (south) is original, dating from the late 12th century, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886. The older doorway has been described as \\"the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire\\". It is in good condition with little evidence of erosion and Greene considers that this is because it has always been protected from the weather. The portico leads into the four-bay compartment. This has a tiled floor and contains a medieval-style fireplace. The roof is ribbed vaulted. On the east wall is a two-arched doorway leading to the former cloisters. To the north another archway leads to the three-bay compartment. This also has a tile floor and contains the brick wine bins added in the 1780s. The roof of this compartment has groined vaults. The undercroft also contains a bell mould, reconstructed from the fragments of the original mould found in the excavations. At the northern end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind arcades above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with capitals, free-standing columns and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and mouldings of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque in style and the arches early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals. Grounds Garden alt=A open stone structure with four columns supporting a lintel. Inside the loggia is a wooden seat. The of grounds surrounding the house have been largely restored to include the 18th-century pathways, the stream-glade and the 19th-century rock garden. The foundations exposed in the excavations show the plan of the former church and monastic buildings. In the grounds is a Grade II listed garden loggia in yellow sandstone, possibly designed by James Wyatt. At its front are two Doric columns and two antae, and above these is a cornice with a fluted frieze. The side walls are built in stone, and the back wall is constructed internally of stone and externally of brickwork. Also in the grounds are several modern sculptures, and a sculpture trail has been designed in conjunction with these. In the 1970s the fragments of the mould found in the bell pit were re-assembled and used to create a replica of the bell, which was cast in Widnes and now stands in a frame in the grounds. This was opened at a ceremony performed by Sir Bernard Lovell in 1977. A herb garden was developed as part of the BBC's Hidden Garden programme. This seeks to re-create a herb garden as it would have been during the medieval period, and its plan is based on herb gardens in other monastic sites. The plants grown are those reputed to be of value in treating the diseases revealed in the excavated skeletons. The gardens also include a woodland gardens with summer house, a stream glade, a wild-flower meadow and an orchard. The gardens are promoted by the Campaign to Protect Rural England.Members Guide 2012, published by CPRE, 2012 Walled gardens Ice House|alt=A mound-shaped structure covered in grass. At the front is a stone wall with a doorway. The 3.5 acre (1 ha) walled garden was restored in the 1980s. It includes an orchard, fruit and vegetable gardens, ornamental borders and a rose walk, as well as the national collection of tree quince (Cydonia oblonga), with 20 different varieties. Close to the walled garden is a Grade II listed ice house, probably dating from the 18th century, which is constructed in brick covered with a mound of earth. The entrance is surrounded by stone walls, from which a tunnel leads to a circular domed chamber. Current activities The museum is a visitor attraction. It arranges a series of events for the general public throughout the year, including guided tours, family fun days and concerts. Its educational programme is aimed at all ages; it includes workshops for the general public, and courses focusing on formal and informal aspects of children's education. An outreach programme is intended for individuals and groups in the community. Since its opening, the museum has won awards for its work in tourism, education, outreach and gardening. In 2004 the museum's Positive Partnerships project, in which people with learning disabilities worked alongside museum staff, was a finalist in the Gulbenkian Prize for museums and galleries. In August 2016 the newly rebuilt and expanded museum opened to the public. This cost ¬£4.5m, of which ¬£3.9m was contributed by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

He also has a saga of his own in B√≥si and Herrau√∞r's saga. His main role in the sagas is as the father of √û√≥ra Borgarhj«´rtr who gave his daughter one or two small lindworms which grew so big that he had to promise her to the man who could slay the serpent(s). Ragnar Lodbrok took on himself to liberate the girl and became her husband. B√≥si and Herrau√∞r's saga works as a prequel describing the origin of the lindworm. In Kr√°kum√°l, the dying Ragnar Lodbrok sings that a more famous earl than Herr√∂√∞r had never steered his longship into a harbour . B√≥si and Herrau√∞r's saga B√≥si and Herrau√∞r's saga tells that Herrau√∞r was the son of king Ring of √ñsterg√∂tland and the nephew of Gautrekr, the king of V√§sterg√∂tland. Herrau√∞r's grandfather was Gauti, a son of Odin. Herrau√∞r's father Ring preferred his illegitimate son Sj√≥√∞r to Herrau√∞r. When Herrau√∞r's best friend B√≥si was outlawed, the two friends set off to spend some years pillaging as Vikings. Back in √ñsterg√∂tland, Sj√≥√∞r forced B√≥si's father to pay money in compensation for B√≥si's crime, so when Sj√≥√∞r and B√≥si met in Wendland the two started fighting and Sj√≥√∞r was killed. When the two friends returned to √ñsterg√∂tland, Ring refused to reconcile with Herrau√∞r and instead he incarcerated Herrau√∞r and B√≥si and intended to execute them. Through magic and threats, Busla, B√≥si's foster-mother, prevailed on Ring to send the two young men on a dangerous quest instead of executing them. They were to find a vulture's egg inscribed with golden letters. The two young men went to Bjarmaland and killed the vulture guarding the temple of Jumala and the priestess Kolfrosta. They also saved the priestess-to-be, Hlei√∞, the sister of Gu√∞mundr of Gl√¶sisvellir. Hlei√∞ was happy to be saved and became Herrau√∞r's wife. Back in √ñsterg√∂tland, Ring accepted the egg and reconciled with his son and B√≥si. Herrau√∞r and B√≥si then departed for the Battle of Br√°vellir to fight for Harald Wartooth and survived the immense battle. Gudmund of Gl√¶sisvellir who wanted to find his sister promised her to Siggeir, the son of Harekr the king of Bjarmaland, if he could find her. The Bjarmians invaded √ñsterg√∂tland, killed king Ring and took Hlei√∞ back to Bjarmaland. When Herrau√∞r and B√≥si returned from the Br√°vellir, they set off to find Hlei√∞ together with B√≥si's foster-mother Busla and his brother Smi√∞r. They rescued Hlei√∞ and kidnapped Edda, the king's daughter. King Harek died trying to stop them. Herrau√∞r became the new king of √ñsterg√∂tland, while B√≥si ascended the throne of Bjarmaland together with his queen Edda. Herrau√∞r and his queen Hlei√∞ had a daughter, √û√≥ra Borgarhj«´rtr. When the vulture's egg hatched, there was a lindworm inside and it soon encircled √û√≥ra Borgarhj«´rtr's bower. Herrau√∞r promised his daughter to the man who could slay the serpent and it was Ragnar Lodbrok who liberated her. Tale of Ragnar's sons In the tale of Tale of Ragnar's sons, Herrau√∞r is the earl of G√∂taland and one of Ragnar Lodbrok's vassals (this fits B√≥si and Herrau√∞r's saga as Sigurd Hring who was victorious at the Battle of Br√°vellir had died and was succeeded by his son Ragnar). Herrau√∞r's daughter √û√≥ra Borgarhj«´rtr was very beautiful. He had given her a lindworm, but after some time, it had encircled her bower and threatened anyone who approached it, except for her servants who fed it with an ox every day. At his symbel, Herrau√∞r promised his daughter to the man who could kill the serpent. When Ragnar heard of this, he went to V√§sterg√∂tland and dressed himself in shaggy clothes that he had treated with tar and sand. He took a spear and approached the serpent which blew poison at him. Ragnar protected himself with his shield and his clothes and stuck the spear through its heart. He then cut off the serpent's head, and when the people found out what had happened, he married √ûora. Gesta Danorum In Gesta Danorum, book 9, Herodd is the king of Sweden. One day when he hunted in the woods, he found some adders that he gave to his daughter Tora. She raised the snakes with whole oxen until they had grown so large that they terrorized the entire country side. Horrified, Herrod promised his daughter to anyone who could kill the serpents. Ragnar Lodbrok donned some furry clothes to protect himself and went to Sweden. There he threw himself in cold water and let the frost make the water into an icy protection of his clothes. At the palace, he met two large snakes who attacked him. Shielded by his clothes he managed to kill them by piercing their hearts with a spear.

The series explores the relationship of a newly wed couple, showing how two people, who met and married through an arranged matchmaking, slowly develop a relationship and learn what it means to be married. Some of the issues explored include what is the most important thing in a marriage, trust and honesty between a couple, how past relationships affect present, and the role of family in a relationship. Unlike other dramas written by Oh Soo-yeon, which focused on people falling in love by fate or destiny, this one is about two people with very different personalities, values, and backgrounds, and seeing how they learn to love one another despite all of their differences. Plot Lee Se-na (Jang Nara) is a single child raised in a wealthy family and pampered by her protective parents. She has never been hurt and naively believes that love can overcome all obstacles. Although she has a big heart, she is selfish, not trusting, and cares mostly only about her own feelings. One day, she meets Han Seung-woo (Ryu Si-won) through an arranged date and instantly falls in love with him. Seung-woo is from a poor family and likes a simple and frugal life. Although he is very honest and righteous, he has difficulty sensing other people's feelings and expressing his own. After a short period of time, Se-na and Seung-woo decide to get married, before they have truly gotten to know one another. We also meet Shin Yoon-soo (Myung Se- bin) and Seo Jin-hee (Lee Hyun-woo), both childhood friends of Seung-woo and each with their strengths, shortcomings, and past relationships with the main duo.

A Democrat, Wilson served in the United States House of Representatives from 1915 until 1937. He was defeated for renomination in 1936 by Newt V. Mills. Wilson was born near Goldonna in Natchitoches Parish. In 1894, he graduated from Iuka Normal Institute in Iuka in Tishomingo County in the far northeastern corner of Mississippi. From 1895 to 1897, he was the principal of Harrisonburg High School in Harrisonburg, the seat of Catahoula Parish. Wilson studied law privately, was admitted to the bar in 1898, and thereafter opened his practice in Harrisonburg. Prior to his service in the U.S. Congress, Wilson was a district attorney, state district court judge, and, from 1900 to 1904, a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. He succeeded a Populist state legislator, Henry Breithaupt. Wilson and Governor Oramel H. Simpson were the two unsuccessful gubernatorial candidates in the 1928 Democratic primary. They lost to the legendary Huey Pierce Long, Jr., at the time a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Long claimed that Wilson carried the support of \\"a bunch of stuffed shirts calling themselves Square Dealers\\" whereas Simpson was backed by \\"a gang of cutthroats and liars from Bourbon Street brothels and those moth-eaten aristocrats sipping their booze and branch water on rich plantations.\\"Bill Dodd, Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics (Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Claitor's Publishers, 1991), p. 166. Long claimed that Wilson and Simpson reminded him of \\"the old medicine man who used to come to Winnfield when I was a boy. That old faker, with his worthless cure-alls, would skin a widow woman out of her last dollar and make her think his medicine would cure anything from toe itch to whooping cough. [Wilson and Simpson] are just alike and are being supported by the same smelly medicine men.\\" One of Wilson's congressional aides was State Representative Rupert Peyton, who served from 1932 to 1936. Peyton was also a Shreveport journalist and historian. Wilson spent his later years in Ruston, the seat of Lincoln Parish in north Louisiana, where he died at the age of seventy-four.

The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The film is set in a small village in Rajasthan, India. It tells the story of a woman named Shanichari, who was abandoned by her mother shortly after her father's death. Bad fortune follows her throughout her life. Cultural background The title is a reference to a custom in certain areas of Rajasthan where women of a lower caste are hired as professional mourners upon the death of upper-caste males. These women are referred to as a \\"rudaali\\" (roo-dah-lee), literally translated as \\"female weeper\\" or \\"weeping woman\\". Their job is to publicly express grief of family members who are not permitted to display emotion due to social status. Plot The story begins with Ram Avtar, the zamindar () of Barna (a village in the desert) realizing his imminent death, and the fact that none of his relatives would mourn him. He thus requests for the services of a famous rudaali named Bhikni (Rakhee), to mourn for him once he dies. Bhikni ends up staying with the widow Shanichari, who lives within the Thakur's compound. As they both begin to bond, Shanichari tells Bhikni her life's story, which is revealed to us in flashbacks. Shanichari was born on a Shanichar (Saturday), which is concerned to be an ill omened day, ruled by the planet Shani (Saturn) in astrology. Shanichari is blamed by the villagers for everything bad that happens around her - starting from her father's death, to her mother Peewli's running off to join a folk theatre troupe. While still young, Shanichari is married off to Ganju, a drunkard, who ends up dying due to a plague at a village fair. Her only support is her son, Budhua, whom she loves very much. However, he likes to roam around aimlessly, just like Peewli did. Meanwhile, the Thakur's son Lakshman Singh reveals that he likes her and offers her a job at the Thakur's haveli. She then serves under his wife, who has been spoiled but is secluded from others. Lakshman tries to teach Shanichari to empower herself and understand her rights, and encourages her to \\"look up\\" into his eyes when speaking to him. One night, after Shanichari's singing performance at the haveli, he gifts her a house of her own, along with two acres of land. Soon, the adult Budhua brings home a wife, Mungri, who is a young prostitute pregnant with his child. However, the couple keeps fighting, and one day in a fit of rage, Mungri aborts the child. Budhua, upset, runs away from home, leaving his mother all alone. It is revealed that throughout her hardships, Shanichari had never shed a tear. One night, Bhikni is called to the neighbouring village to meet Bhimdata. The Thakur passes away a few hours later. Lakshman Singh and Shanichari are then seen bidding farewell to each other as Singh plans to leave the village after his father's demise. They are interrupted by a messenger from Bhimdata, who reveals that Bhikni succumbed to the plague, and in her last few minutes requested that Shanichari be told that she was her mother, Peewli. Shanichari then begins to weep profusely, and takes over as the new rudaali, crying at the Thakur's funeral.

It is also a component of the organized militia of the state of Ohio, which also includes the Ohio Naval Militia, the Ohio Military Reserve and the Ohio Air National Guard. The Ohio Army National Guard consists of a variety of combat, combat support and combat service support units. As of September 2010, its end strength exceeded 11,400 soldiers. Its headquarters is the Beightler Armory in Columbus, Ohio. Many units conduct Annual Training at Camp Grayling, Michigan. On May 4, 1970, Guard units infamously opened fire onto a crowd of both Vietnam War protestors and simple bystanders on the campus of Kent State University, killing four and wounding nine others, an event known as the Kent State shootings. The President's Commission on Campus Unrest concluded that the Guard's actions were \\"unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable.\\" History Founding militia The Ohio National Guard can be traced back to the initial settlement at Marietta, Ohio, in July 1788. Rooted in the English and early colonial tradition of citizen-soldiers providing local protection and law enforcement, these Revolutionary War veterans and their families quickly organized into local militia units. The federal government passed the Militia Act of 1792 which required all able bodied men ages 18 to 45 to serve in their local militia units and provide their own weapons and equipment. It further authorized the Governor of each state to appoint an Adjutant General to enact the orders of the Governor and to supervise unit training and organization. Reflecting the Founding Fathers' distrust of a large standing army, it strictly limited the ability of the militia to serve outside of their state borders and placed effective control with the Governor rather than the federal government. The occupation of the Ohio Territory by the United States was contested by the region's native inhabitants. A confederation of Indian tribes with British backing engaged in a campaign of raids and depredations upon the scattered settlements, resulting in full-scale war by the 1790s. The disastrous campaigns led by Generals Josiah Harmar and Arthur St. Clair only intensified Indian resistance to white migration and threatened the existence of white Ohio settlements. The decisive victory of General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), outside of present-day Toledo and the subsequent Treaty of Greenville (1795) removed the combined British-Indian military threat to Ohio settlers for the time being. While only limited numbers of Ohio militia played a part in these campaigns, the local militia units formed an important bulwark defending their local communities against potential attack. War of 1812 After achieving statehood in 1803 Ohio continued the law creating a body of \\"state troops\\" and each significant village or county providing its own local unit. The military readiness of these local militia units varied greatly as did their uniform and armament. The monthly militia muster was supposed to train the members in close order drill and marksmanship, but in many cases was more of a social and political event. Moreover, each unit was responsible for electing its own officers with the victors often being the most popular or the one best able to furnish a ready supply of sour mash. With the advent of war with Great Britain in 1812, there was renewed interest in beefing up the size and effectiveness of the militia. Ohio Governor Josiah Meigs formed three regiments of Ohio militia in response to the proposed invasion to drive the British and their Indian allies from Canada with a view towards annexing it to the United States. The first attempt ended with the surrender of Fort Detroit to the British by General William Hull in late 1812. Although not present in large numbers, Ohio militia were present and paroled shortly thereafter with the promise not to engage in any further hostilities. Ohio militia also played a role in the efforts of Gen. William Henry Harrison to re-capture Fort Detroit and decisively defeat the British at the Battle of the Thames. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War After the end of the inconclusive War of 1812, the militia system in Ohio abandoned its regimental formations and reverted to multiple small units representing the various municipalities throughout the rapidly growing state. With the last Indians expelled from the state's borders and peaceful relations along the Canada‚ÄìUS border, there seemed little need for a fully armed and trained militia. With the brief exception of a border dispute with Michigan that caused the Governor to issue a militia call up, meaningful local militia musters and drills again became more the exception than the rule. The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848 saw a renewed interest in vitalizing the militia throughout the entire country. With the regular U.S. Army at a strength of just over 13,000, it became evident that any successful military campaign against Mexico was going to require extensive militia involvement. Ohio played a significant role, raising several regiments of infantry and artillery batteries from existing militia units and volunteers. The 1st Ohio Volunteers comprised part of the army under Gen. Zachary Taylor and took part in the battlefield victories of Monterrey and Buena Vista. The American Civil War It was during the great Civil War however, that the Ohio National Guard can directly trace its start. Ohio played a critical part in the Union war effort and was one of the leading contributors of manpower (including a crop of gifted generals to include Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, McPherson, Griffin,). As most of the existing militia units were incorporated into federalized volunteer regiments, the mission of local defense and order fell to organized units of those exempted from federal service, youths, middle aged men and a sprinkling of veterans who had completed their active duty enlistments. Numerous battalions were organized statewide that were for the first time titled \\"National Guard.\\". During the war the Ohio National Guard served in a variety of roles, providing not only guards at the Camp Chase and Johnson Island POW camps, but serving in a number of combat situations. During the September 1862 Confederate incursion into southeast Ohio and the famed Morgan's Raid in July 1863, Ohio guardsmen were actively involved. While subjected to ridicule as a result of the lackluster performance of some poorly trained and armed local units, the Ohio National Guard in actuality played a key role in the ultimate defeat of Morgan and his much vaunted force of Confederate cavalry. Instrumental in defending the approaches to Pomeroy and its river fords, Ohio Guardsmen also were responsible for blocking Morgan's escape route at Buffington Island until pursuing Union forces caught up and administered a stinging defeat to Morgan on July 19, 1863 ‚Äì the last battle fought on Ohio soil. Over 35,000 Ohio Guardsmen were federalized and organized into regiments for 100 days service in May 1864. Shipped to the Eastern Theater, they were designed to be placed into \\"safe\\" rear area duty to protect the railroads and supply points thereby freeing regular troops for Grant's push on the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. As events transpired, many units found themselves in the thick of combat, stationed in the path of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early's veteran Army of the Valley during its famed Raid on Washington. These Guard units participated in the battles of Monacacy, Fort Stevens, Maryland Heights, and in the siege of Petersburg. Ohio Guard units met the battle tested foe head on and helped blunt the Confederate offensive thereby saving The District of Columbia from capture. Significant casualties were incurred but the Ohio Guard had proved itself the equal of regular units on the field of battle. Mexican Border Crisis With the end of the Civil War, the Ohio National Guard was rapidly demobilized and its extensive inventory placed into mothballs maintained by a few non-commissioned officers. From a war-time strength in excess of 50,000, by 1870 the Ohio National Guard had been allowed to dwindle to fewer than 500 officers and enlisted men. Yet Ohio officials soon rediscovered that the Ohio Guard was an essential asset in situations other than war. Like the rest of the nation, labor unrest started to spread in the latter part of the century resulting in violent strikes and crippling shutdowns, especially in the railroad industry. Ohio Governors repeatedly called upon Ohio Guardsmen to keep the peace. In numerous situations the Guard's intervention resulted in the immediate restoration of peace and order and succeeded in keeping violence and property damage to a minimum. Having demonstrated its value beyond the battlefield, the Ohio Guard was boosted in numbers and funding to a meaningful level. The breakout of hostilities with Spain over Cuba in 1898 also led to an increase in the size and improved equipment and training for the Ohio National Guard. Several regiments of infantry and artillery were formed and shipped to Tampa, Florida for training and eventual transport to the front lines in Cuba. Due to the rapid American success, the war ended prior to any of these units actually being deployed in a combat situation. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War thrust the United States into the role of a world power and both military and civilian leaders recognized that it was necessary to maintain a uniformly trained and armed military force. This reflected the slow evolution of the Ohio militia into a National Guard which in addition to being a state force for quelling civil disturbances, was assuming a key role in the national defense. Leading the effort to accomplish this was Major General Charles Dick of the Ohio National Guard. After serving in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he was later elected to the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in passing the Dick Act of 1903. This benchmark legislation repealed the antiquated militia laws and effectively converted the various volunteer militias into the National Guard as we know it today. Under the Dick Act Guard units received increased federal funding and equipment. In return each state National Guard was required to conform to federal standards for training and organization. Rather than the periodic muster, each unit was expected to muster for a set number of monthly drills and an extended summer camp. Also, for the first time state Adjutant Generals had a formal relationship with the War Department. These common sense reforms were to pay their first dividends in 1916 when Ohio National Guard units were mobilized to serve as part of Gen. John Pershing's punitive expedition against Pancho Villa along the Mexican Border. Although the expedition failed to capture or dispatch the notorious Villa and his army of bandits, valuable lessons were learned in combined operations and mobile warfare. The relatively speedy and seamless mobilization and deployment to the desert regions of the southwest also served as a confidence builder for the units and their active duty counterparts. The errors and problems of the 1916 mobilization also proved to be excellent teaching tools that were to pay dividends when the entire Ohio Guard was to be mobilized by President Woodrow Wilson a scant 10 months later in April 1917 World War I As war had broken out in Europe in 1914, the original intent of the United States was to avoid the conflict and maintain a stance of neutrality. As hostilities between the great European powers bogged down into a bloody stalemate, each side sought an edge to break the deadlock. For Germany, it was unrestricted submarine warfare. While this assisted in slowing down trade and supplies between the Allies and the United States, the end result was to propel the United States into war as American merchant ships began to be targeted. After the United States joined the war in April 1917, the manpower requirements for a modern field army were so great that only with a draft could the ranks be filled. Congress passed the Selective Service Act, which decentralized the selection to local draft boards within each state. With this massive mobilization the strength of the Ohio National Guard expanded and was eventually organized into the 37th Division. To preserve its Ohio identity, they adopted the nickname of the \\"Buckeye\\" Division. Again under the overall leadership of \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, Ohio Guardsmen were a key component of the American Expeditionary Force sent over to France. Rated by the German General Staff as one of the best six American divisions for combat effectiveness, the \\"Buckeye\\" Division proved its worth in numerous battles including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and the St. Mihiel Salient. This reputation for being a crack unit came with a considerable cost as the Buckeye Division alone suffered almost 5400 casualties while in France. Ohio Guard units also formed part of the 42nd \\"Rainbow\\" Division which won an enviable combat record along the front lines. World War II During the period between the two World Wars, the Ohio National Guard found itself frequently called upon to perform relief duties during natural disasters. Noteworthy were efforts during the almost annual flooding of the Ohio River and the great tornado of 1924 in the Lorain and Sandusky area. Units were again utilized to keep the peace during a series of bitter strikes in the coal-mining region of southeast Ohio. Although initially perceived as being brought in to aid and assist the mine operators, they won begrudging respect for adopting a fair and even-handed approach. Unlike the bloody history associated with the use of the National Guard in labor disputes in many other states, the Ohio Guard's non- partisan approach alleviated numerous potentially explosive labor conflicts. As the year 1939 brought yet another world war, the Ohio Guard found itself in a moderate state of readiness and under the leadership of Major General Robert S. Beightler. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a state of emergency and brought the National Guard under federal control in October 1940, the Buckeye Division was among their ranks. Notably, Company C, 192nd Tank Battalion, from Camp Perry, Ohio, joined a provisional unit sent to the Philippines to bolster the active duty and Filipino forces there. When the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 brought the country into a declared war, the Ohio tankers found themselves under attack as Japanese forces landed in the Philippines within days. As the remnant defenders withdrew to Bataan, the 192nd disintegrated as a unit, its members eventually captured along with the others in 1942. These Ohioans, who had fought from the very beginning of the war, remained as prisoners for the duration. The Buckeye Division participated in the Pacific theater of the war, serving in the Northern Solomons and Luzon (Philippines) campaigns. Entering combat in June 1943, they fought at New Georgia and Bougainville (in November 1943) alongside the 3rd Marine Division and others. March 1944 saw a ferocious attack by Japanese forces against the division at Bougainville, one which the stretched and weakened division fought off. January 1945 saw the division go ashore in Luzon as part of the XIV Corps, and by February it had liberated Manila. The Buckeye Division produced seven Medal of Honor recipients during World War II. MG Beightler led the Buckeye Division throughout the course of the war, the only one of 32 National Guard division commanders to accomplish this. The Cold War The 37th Infantry Division was reformed in the OH ARNG in 1945‚Äì46. During this time period the Air Force also broke off from the Army to become a separate service branch. Within the Ohio Guard this was reflected in the creation of the Ohio Air National Guard. Korean War era The demobilization from World War II had barely taken place when once again the Ohio National Guard was mobilized for the Korean War. As part of the mobilization of National Guard divisions across the country, in 1952 the Buckeye Division activated to serve as a training division at then-Camp Polk, Louisiana. While no major Ohio Guard units were deployed as units to Korea during hostilities, National Guard units from Ohio were sent to Korea where individual soldiers from the units were then assigned to serve in the regular Army as replacements. On April 22, 1951, the 987th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, a National Guard unit from Stark County, Ohio, was assigned by IX Corps, Eight Army, to provide support to a two-divisional attack \\"Reconnaissance-in-Force\\" in the north central part of the Korean peninsula, just below the 38th Longitudinal Parallel. After the Armistice Agreement was signed in Korea, the Ohio Guard's focus returned to its state mission and reorganization in accordance with federal mandates. Significant challenges were met by the continuing changes and advances in technology which required a flexible and better educated force. World events also continued to impact the Ohio Guard. The Berlin Crisis of 1961 resulted in the mobilization of ten Ohio Air and Army National Guard units to help counter the Soviet threat. It was during this period that the Ohio Guard's units switched over to the new Reorganisation Objective Army Division (ROAD) framework directed by the Department of Defense. Most notable among these changes was the deactivation of the storied 37th \\"Buckeye\\" Division on February 15, 1968. Much of the former division's units became part of the 73d Infantry Brigade, 38th Infantry Division. From 1959 to 1968, the 137th Air Defense Artillery Regiment was part of the force. 2-137 & 3-137 served with 371 AGAD from 1 September 1959 to 1 February 1968, which 1-137 served with the 137 AGAD, until 1 April 1963, and then transferred to the 371 AGAD, 1 April 1963, to 1 February 1972.Aumiller Vietnam and Kent State With the escalation of the Vietnam War, the Ohio Guard was again called upon to engage in combat upon foreign shores. Both the Ohio Army and Air National Guards deployed units to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. The mission to support state authorities still continued during this time with the Ohio Guard playing a key role in quelling a full- scale riot at the Ohio Penitentiary in 1968 and in helping to curb the violence associated with the trucker's strike in 1970. It was subsequent to this latter event that the Ohio Guard was involved in one of the most unfortunate events in its long history, the Kent State shootings of May 4, 1970. Called to the campus Kent State University to quell demonstrations and anti-war protests, members of the guard ‚Äî in what was recently described as \\"one of America's most horrific campus tragedies\\" ‚Äî killed four unarmed students and wounded several more, garnering severely negative international attention and criticism, especially as some of the victims were simply passersby. Later years After the United States withdrew from Vietnam, the Ohio Guard, like the rest of the military, was faced by the challenges of significantly decreased funding and adapting to new missions. Increasing attention was directed towards peace-keeping and civic assistance missions. Of particular success were the efforts of the Ohio Guard in saving lives and aiding hard pressed local authorities during the winter blizzards of 1977 and 1978. Also of note was the extensive mission to Honduras which provided considerable infrastructure improvement and medical assistance to an impoverished nation while at the same time providing valuable training experience to Ohio Guard personnel. In organization terms, the 73d Brigade was released from assignment to the 38th ID in 1977 and was redesignated the 73d Infantry Brigade, a separate brigade. During the draw down of forces after the Cold War, units of the 73rd and the 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment consolidated to form the 37th Brigade, 28th Infantry Division. A year later, the brigade was reunited with the 38th Infantry Division. Desert Storm and beyond When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the Ohio National Guard provided numerous transportation, logistical and other combat support units to assist in Operation Desert Storm. Additionally, numerous individual Ohio Guardsmen with specialty skills volunteered and served in Operation Desert Storm. Although active hostilities ceased in February 1991 after a lightning campaign, the continuing presence of Saddam Hussein required continued military presence in the Persian Gulf region. The Ohio Guard continued in its role as key player as its Air National Guard units were routinely deployed to enforce the no-fly zones over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch. Other Ohio Guard units were periodically deployed to the Persian Gulf and Kuwait to engage in joint desert warfare training. Ohio Guardsmen also saw overseas service in a demanding environment when deployed to the Balkans to provide peacekeeping support in war‚Äìtorn Bosnia and Kosovo. Units of the Ohio Guard continued to take a role in providing humanitarian assistance in impoverished areas of Central America. Engineering, transportation and medical detachments provided medical care as well as building roads, wells, bridges, schools and other infrastructure. On the domestic front the Ohio Guard fulfilled its role in assisting civilian authorities in maintaining order in extraordinary circumstances. A significant number of Ohio Guardsmen were activated in 1993 to help quell the deadly prison riots at the Lucasville Correctional Facility. Personnel from the Ohio Guard also provided crucial advice and stood by to provide law enforcement support during rioting in Cincinnati and civic unrest surrounding the operation of a toxic waste incinerator plant near East Liverpool. Disaster relief also continued to be a priority mission with service during the Shadyside floods, tornadoes, snow emergencies and Ohio River flooding. After the attacks of September 11, numerous units from the Army Guard supplemented by security police units of the Air Guard were mobilized on short notice in the following days and executed critical security missions at various locations for extended periods of time. Other communications and engineering units deployed to the Persian Gulf area and Afghanistan in support of the war on terrorism. In 2005 The Ohio Army National Guard deployed the 37th Brigade Combat Team, 73rd Troop Command, 16th Engineer Brigade, 416th Engineer group, 145th Regiment (Regional Training Institute), 196th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, 112th Engineer Battalion, 216th Engineer Battalion, 731st Transportation Battalion in response to Hurricane Katrina. Transformation As of late 2006, the Ohio Army National Guard began a process of transformation in line with the overall transformation of all active and National Guard units. Ohio will activate two new modular units, the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and the 371st Sustainment Brigade. The 16th Engineer Brigade, a current formation, will have two of its subordinate commands, the 512th and 612th Engineer Battalions, inactivated. Some parts of the 73rd Troop Command will also undergo changes. The result, when completed by September 2007, will be an Ohio Army National Guard organized under a Joint Force Headquarters and made up of five major commands: the 37th Infantry BCT, the 16th Engineer Brigade, the 174th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, the 73rd Joint Task Force, and the 371st Sustainment Brigade. All of this will occur with minimal changes in the end strength of the OHARNG at 10,300 Soldiers. The 37th Infantry BCT will be one of 34 combat brigades in the Army National Guard. Its core is two infantry battalions and a fires battalion: *1st Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment (United States) *1st Battalion, 125th Infantry Regiment (United States) (Michigan Army National Guard) *1st Battalion, 134th Field Artillery Regiment (United States) *1st Squadron (RSTA), 126th Cavalry Regiment (United States) (Michigan Army National Guard) *237th Brigade Support Battalion *37th Special Troops Battalion Remaining combat units in the State of Ohio have also been realigned. The 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry, along with one company from the 148th Infantry and one company from the 112th Engineer Battalion, transformed into the 1st Battalion, 145th Armored Regiment and, together with the 2nd Squadron, 107th Cavalry, were briefly elements of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division, Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Currently, both the 1st Battalion, 145th Armor and the 2nd Squadron, 107th Cavalry belong to the 174th Air Defense Artillery Brigade for day-to-day command and control purposes. In addition, there are elements of the 137th Aviation Regiment in the state, previously part of the 18th Aviation Brigade before it was deactivated. Additional changes will occur with the subsidiary units of the 73rd Troop Command. As a consequence of the transformation of the 37th into an infantry brigade combat team, the unit is to be given the old Buckeye Patch of the 37th Infantry Division of World War I and World War II. Foreign partnerships The Ohio Army National Guard has maintained military partnerships with foreign militaries under the National Guard State Partnership Program. The OARNG, together with the Ohio Air National Guard, has worked with Hungary since 1993, and the program's inception, and in September 2006 initiated a second program with Serbia. The purpose of the program is to provide assistance to the host countries in establishing reserve military forces like the National Guard, before transitioning to follow-on programs designed to assist the citizen- soldiers in their non-military lives. Major units The Ohio Army National Guard presently consists of the following major commands or units: *Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) *73rd Joint Task Force (73rd JTF) *37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (37th IBCT) *16th Engineer Brigade *371st Sustainment Brigade *174th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (174th ADAB) *147th Regiment (Regional Training Institute) *52nd Weapons of Mass Destruction / Civil Support Team (WMD / CST) Historic units * 50px 107th Cavalry Regiment * 50px 145th Infantry Regiment * 146th Infantry Regiment * 50px 147th Infantry Regiment * 50px 148th Infantry Regiment * 50px 166th Infantry Regiment * 50px 134th Field Artillery Regiment References *\\"Ohio Army National Guard Sets 12-Year Strength Mark\\" (PDF) *\\"OHARNG will undergo largest force structure change in nearly 40 years,\\" Staff Sergeant Joshua Mann, Buckeye Guard Vol 29, No. 1 External links *Ohio National Guard website *Bibliography of Ohio Army National Guard History compiled by the United States Army Center of Military History *The 122nd Ohio Army National Guard Band Category:Military in Ohio Category:Military units and formations established in 1788 Category:1788 establishments in the Northwest Territory ","title":"Ohio Army National Guard"},{"id":"8053385","text":"New York State Route 143 (NY 143) is a state highway in Albany County, New York, in the United States. The highway runs from an intersection with NY 85 in the town of Westerlo to a junction with NY 144 in the hamlet of Coeymans. The entire route is two lanes wide. NY 143 follows the path of the Coeymans and Westerlo Plank Road, a plank road that operated from 1850 to the early 20th century. The road became a state highway by 1915 and was designated NY 143 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description NY 143 west at CR 312 in Dormansville NY 143 begins at an intersection with NY 85 (Delaware Turnpike) in the town of Westerlo. It proceeds south through the town as a two-lane highway, serving residential areas that become less densely populated as the route heads away from NY 85\\\\. The number of homes along the road rises slightly as NY 143 enters the small hamlet of Westerlo, located at the intersection of NY 143 and the eastern terminus of County Route 1 (CR 1, named Switz Kill Road). At CR 1, NY 143 turns eastward to serve Westerlo's central business district. The route passes north of Westerlo Town Park and intersects CR 412 (Airport Road) before leaving the hamlet on a winding, generally easterly alignment. Continuing through the town of Westerlo, NY 143 passes south of a large airstrip located in a rural area between NY 143 and CR 412\\\\. The route remains on an eastward track for another half-mile (0.8 km), meandering through dense woods before turning southeastward into an open area with a handful of isolated homes. NY 143 soon enters the hamlet of Dormansville, where it intersects with the southern terminus of CR 312 and passes some small businesses ahead of a junction with NY 32 just east of the community. NY 143 joins NY 32, forming an overlap that takes both roads eastward toward Alcove Reservoir. The conjoined routes connect two sections of CR 411 and pass over Hannacrois Creek before crossing into the town of Coeymans as Indian Fields Road. Not far from the town line, NY 143 and NY 32 begin to trend northeastward as they approach and eventually cross the Alcove Reservoir on a narrow causeway. The overlap ends just east of the crossing, with NY 32 bending northward along Indian Fields Road and NY 143 forking to the southeast on an unnamed highway. For the next , NY 143 runs along the eastern edge of the reservoir, passing by little more than dense forests. The route breaks from the shoreline at the hamlet of Alcove, which comprises several isolated homes connected by a handful of local streets. Here, NY 143 meets the northern terminus of CR 111 as it turns to follow Hannacrois Creek eastward along the base of a narrow, winding valley. Approaching NY 144, the eastern terminus of NY 143, on NY 143 eastbound in Coeymans About from Alcove, NY 143 reaches the hamlet of Coeymans Hollow, a residential community at the route's junction with CR 103 (Blodgett Hill Road). East of the community, the roadside homes give way to less developed areas of forests and fields as the highway intersects with CR 106 (Tompkins Road) in front of the Sycamore Country Club. The trend soon reverses, however, as NY 143 exits the creek valley and serves another stretch of homes ahead of an intersection with CR 102 (Starr Road). Here, NY 143 turns to the southeast, following Hannacrois Creek to the hamlet of Aquetuck, located about north of the Greene County line. While the creek continues into Greene County, NY 143 curves northeastward toward the nearby village of Ravena as Martins Hill Road. From Aquetuck, the route crosses a series of hills to reach Ravena, where it meets U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) in the southwestern part of the community. At this point, NY 143 changes names to Main Street as it runs generally east‚Äìwest through Ravena's commercial center. While traversing the village, NY 143 crosses over a CSX-owned railroad line and passes crosses under the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87). Past the Thruway, the commercial buildings give way to homes as NY 143 transitions from the village of Ravena to the adjacent hamlet of Coeymans. The highway becomes known as Church Street for its final few blocks before descending into the Hudson River valley and ending at an intersection with NY 144 (Main Street) just west of the river. While NY 143 ends here, its right-of-way continues east towards the riverfront as Fourth Street. History Most of NY 143 follows the right-of-way of the Coeymans and Westerlo Plank Road, a plank road partially constructed in the early 19th century by the New Baltimore and Rensselaerville Turnpike, which ran from the Greene County town of New Baltimore to Rensselaerville in Albany County. The New Baltimore and Rensselaerville Turnpike Company suffered from financial troubles in the middle of the century, which led the company to sell the road to the Coeymans and Westerlo Plank Road Company, a new company incorporated in 1850. After purchasing the old New Baltimore‚ÄìRensselaerville road, the company built a spur leading from the original plank road to the hamlet of Coeymans Landing (now Coeymans). From Coeymans Landing, the newly established Coeymans Landing‚ÄìRensselaerville route proceeded generally southwestward through Ravena to Peacock's Corners, where the Coeymans Landing spur met the old road to New Baltimore. Here, the route turned to follow a northwesterly track through southern Albany County to the Delaware Turnpike (now part of NY 85) west of Westerlo. Six toll gates were installed along the route, with the easternmost of the stops positioned midway between Coeymans Landing and Ravena. The other five collection points were placed about apart in Peacock's Corners, Coeymans Hollow, Indian Fields, Dormansville, and Westerlo. While most of the hamlets still exist in some form, Indian Fields was eventually abandoned to create the Alcove Reservoir. The plank road operated for over 60 years, connecting farmers in Coeymans and Westerlo to the Hudson River at Coeymans Landing. The road was resurfaced with stone in 1860, and the company's 30-year charter was renewed in 1880 for another 30 years. By 1915, ownership of the highway had been transferred to the state of New York. While most of the old plank road was retained as a state highway, the piece west of Westerlo was abandoned by 1926 in favor of a north‚Äìsouth connection between the hamlet and the Delaware Turnpike. The Westerlo‚ÄìCoeymans state road went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when it was designated NY 143.

The band started in 1996 as a side project of Self-Conviction members in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The band's lyrics were focused on \\"Third World struggles\\" and animal liberation issues. Point Of No Return's first CD, \\"Centelha\\" (Sparks), was released by Liberation Records in Brazil and Catalyst Records in US. Their sound was described as a mix of Earth Crisis metal mosh with death metal elements. The band had three singers, like their North American counterpart, Path of Resistance. The band toured Europe twice, in 2000 and 2002, and toured Argentina in 2001. After a seven months break and a supposed \\"last show\\" in Argentina, the band came back with a new album in 2002, \\"Liberdade Imposta, Liberdade Conquistada\\" (Imposed Freedom, Conquered Freedom). The songs were more deep and melancholic, but also with a strong influence from bands like Cro-Mags, Judge and Napalm Death. The lyrics, this time completely in Portuguese, dealt about political and social issues. Point of No Return played its last show in 2006.

The series first appeared in Pilote magazine on January 11, 1973. In 1976 Les √âditions Dargaud started publication of hardcover albums. Synopsis The short stories are usually told in one-page segments, and unpredictably follow the lives of the series' cast. This includes the old nameless shepherd, his successor, the young Athanase Percevalve, the Dog Without a Name (an intellectual talking shepherd's dog), and a flock of eccentric, verbal sheep, led by Romuald the black ram. Other unorthodox characters appear, such as the Berthold the stupid St. Bernhard, Kattarsis the petite self-conscious sphinx, a lion, a fox, eagles, snakes, and \\"Death\\" in the shape of an attractive woman. Some of these recur frequently. There is usually no apparent plot in any of these stories from the Swiss Alps. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fmurr.htm Instead, they often consist of different dialogues and simultaneous happenings, making the overall impression of a totally absurd and secluded world. Nevertheless, F'murr always manages to maintain a kind of direction and realism in his otherwise pointless universe, and somewhere in between is the humour that his fans find hilarious but inexplicable.

It was fronted by Amy Dumas, better known as Lita to professional wrestling fans of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). During her last wrestling match at WWE's Survivor Series 2006, Dumas wore a Luchagors T-shirt. History The name Luchagors is an homage to the term Luchador, a Lucha libre performer. Dumas performed this style early in her professional wrestling career. It is combined with the word gore, as in horror films, of which Amy Dumas and Shane Morton are fans. The band started out playing small gigs in and around the Atlanta area. The band's world premiere show was at the Rock-n-Shock event, which was held at the Masquerade in Atlanta, Georgia on September 14, 2006. The event took place to honor Sean Shocker. In early 2007, they began recording their debut album, which was produced by Skid Row bassist Rachel Bolan. They finished recording the tracks for their album on March 17, 2007. In August 2007, an original member of the group, their drummer Troy King, left the band. Their self-titled debut album, The Luchagors, was released physically and as a download through online outlets on September 11. By October, however, Troy decided to stay with the band. Following the release of the album, the Luchagors went on a massive tour to promote the album. The album sold over 10,000 downloads on iTunes and they toured nationwide with NOFX and Bad Religion. One of the 10,000 downloads by chance was Tim Armstrong who was impressed with the style of the album as well as the vocal duties of Dumas that he signed the band to his label Hellcat Records. On the February 12, 2012 episode of her show PunkRockalypse, Dumas announced that The Luchagors will be recording their second album in the summer of 2012 and will be produced by Lars Frederiksen. In 2014, Amy Dumas stated in multiple interviews that the band was finished at the moment due to an unsuccessful tour in the UK. There was no update on the band's second album following this announcement. The Luchagors played their last show together on July 31, 2014 at The Drunken Unicorn in Atlanta, Georgia.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. SSE operates in the United Kingdom and Ireland. As a generator of renewable electricity in the UK and Ireland, it develops, owns and operates low-carbon infrastructure to support the zero- carbon transition. This includes onshore and offshore wind, hydro power, electricity transmission and distribution grids, gas and energy from waste, alongside providing energy products and services for businesses. It is UK- listed. As a real Living Wage and Fair Tax Mark accredited company, it employs 12,000 people across the UK and Ireland. History Origins The company has its origins in two public sector electricity supply authorities. The former North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was founded in 1943 to design, construct and manage hydroelectricity projects in the Highlands of Scotland, and took over further generation and distribution responsibilities on the nationalisation of the electricity industry within the United Kingdom in 1948. The former Southern Electricity Board was created in 1948 to distribute electricity in Southern England. Whilst the Southern Electricity Board was a distribution only authority, with no power generation capacity of its own, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric board was a broader spectrum organisation, with its own generating capabilities. Because of its history and location, the Hydro-Electric Board was responsible for most of the hydroelectric generating capacity in the United Kingdom. Both authorities were privatised in 1990/91, initially retaining their pre privatisation geographic and functional bases. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board became Scottish Hydro-Electric, whilst the Southern Electricity Board became Southern Electric. Post privatisation Scottish and Southern Energy was formed in September 1998, following a merger between Scottish Hydro-Electric and Southern Electric. In August 2000, Scottish and Southern Energy acquired the SWALEC energy supply business. SWALEC operate exclusively in Wales while SSE operates in Scotland and England. In July 2004, the company acquired the Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry Power Stations for ¬£250million. In January 2008, it went on to buy Airtricity Holdings, an Irish wind farm business.Scottish & Southern to buy Irish Windfarm firm In August 2009, it agreed to purchase Uskmouth power station from Welsh Power Group Limited. In April 2010, the company purchased the natural gas exploration and production assets of Hess Corporation in three areas of the United Kingdom Continental Shelf ‚Äì Everest/Lomond, Easington and Bacton. In January 2010, Scottish and Southern Energy changed the core company branding from Scottish and Southern Energy to SSE.First press release with new branding Separation of retail supply division In November 2017, it was announced that SSE was looking to separate from its retail subsidiary which would then merge with the npower division of rival Innogy. It was planned that SSE shareholders will own 65.6% of the demerged entity and Innogy would hold the remainder. The resulting company would have been listed on the London Stock Exchange and included npower's residential and business retail business, and SSE's residential energy supply and home services business, excluding its business in Ireland. Although the merger received preliminary regulatory clearance from the Competition and Markets Authority on 30 August 2018, and full clearance was given on 10 October 2018, it was abandoned on 17 December 2018, with the companies blaming \\"very challenging market conditions\\". In September 2019 SSE announced that it would be selling its retail business to OVO Energy: the transaction was completed in January 2020. Ovo owns SSE Energy Services and is responsible for all its management decisions but still uses the SSE brand under licence. Operations SSE's core focus is economically regulated electricity networks and renewables. Complemented by businesses with a key role to play in enabling the net zero transition. Its subsidiaries are organised into the main businesses of renewables, electricity transmission, electricity distribution, thermal, enterprise, energy solutions and Airtricity. Renewables From onshore and offshore wind to hydro electric power, SSE Renewables develops, operates and owns the low carbon infrastructure which will support the net zero transition. Transmission SSEN Transmission plays a critical role in the transition to a low carbon future, developing, building, maintaining and operating a network for net zero. Vital to net zero ambitions it transports huge quantities of clean, green renewable power over a quarter of the UK land mass across some of its most challenging terrain. Distribution Economically-regulated Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks powers 4 million homes and businesses across the north of Scotland and central southern England. Employing more than 3,500 people in the development and maintenance of the modern flexible distribution network required for a low-carbon world, the business is vital to efforts to reach net zero. Business Energy It supplies sector leading customer solutions for homes and businesses, from small start-ups to large national corporates and public sector clients, across the UK. Thermal SSE Thermal comprises the business' flexible generation, energy-from-waste and energy storage activities, with over 600 employees across the UK and Ireland. Enterprise Its Enterprise business provides innovative solutions to build, own, operate and maintain energy and communications infrastructure in the UK and Ireland. Airtricity Through the SSE Airtricity brand it supplies green electricity, natural gas and energy-related services to homes and businesses in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Living wage SSE became the largest officially accredited Living Wage Employer in the United Kingdom in 2013. All its employees across the United Kingdom are guaranteed to receive the then-Living Wage rate of at least ¬£7.85 an hour in 2013. Fair Tax Mark In October 2014, SSE became the first company on the FTSE 100 to be awarded the Fair Tax Mark which is an independent accreditation process for identifying companies making an effort to be transparent about their tax affairs.

It encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience, in most cases, and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, in other cases. Maternal health revolves around the health and wellness of women, particularly when they are pregnant, at the time they give birth, and during child-raising. WHO has indicated that even though motherhood has been considered as a fulfilling natural experience that is emotional to the mother, a high percentage of women go through a lot of challenges where they suffer health-wise and sometimes even die (WHO n.p). Because of this, there is a need to invest in the health of women (Amiri and Ulf-G 13). The investment can be achieved in different ways, among the main ones being subsidizing the healthcare cost, education on maternal health, encouraging effective family planning, and ensuring progressive check up on the health of women with children.  Maternal morbidity and mortality  WHO estimates that about 300,000 maternal deaths occurred in 2015. These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, all of which have highly effective interventions. As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality has fallen by about 44 percent, which represented a decline of about 2.3 percent annually over the period from 1990 to 2015. While there has been a decline in worldwide mortality rates much more has to be done. High rates still exist particularly in low and middle income countries (99%), sub- saharan Africa accounts for more than half of these deaths and South Asia for about one-third of them. one third of the maternal deaths occur in India and Nigeria. The effect of a mother's death results in vulnerable families, and their infants, if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday. Both maternal mortality (death) and severe maternal morbidity (illness) are \\"associated with a high rate of preventability.\\" In 2010 the U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations described maternal mortality as a \\"sentinel event\\", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system. Subsidizing the cost of healthcare will help improve the health status of women. However, the health status of women should not be generalized with that of the other category of people. Countries such as the U.S, U.K, and others have laws where government and non-governmental bodies work to reduce and even eliminate any fee that is directed to pregnant women or women who have health issues that are related to pregnancy. When women deliver their babies in certified healthcare facilities without paying or paying a very small amount of money, they are motivated to use their own money on the diet of the baby, clothing, and other needs (Onarheim, Iversen, and Bloom n.p). Also, when women attend clinics without being charged and are issued with free supplements, their health is maintained, and this reduces the cost that the monetary resources that the government invests in healthcare. In turn, the maternal morbidity rate, together with mortality rates, is lowered. Education on various issues related to maternal health is essential to control and improve the healthcare of women. Women who have the resources have a low chance of their health status deteriorating because of the knowledge they have. These women make the right decision regarding family planning, the best time to give birth as far as their financial capabilities are concerned, and their nutrition, before, during, and after giving birth. Gannon (n.p) reports that the maternal rate of mortality reduced by 70% between 1946 and 1953, when women started getting maternal education. The study has recommended that the study should focus on communities that are marginalized and girls who are below the age of 18. When the government manages to reduce unwanted and unplanned pregnancies among these two groups of people, it will become easier to reduce the maternal health issue and the cost associated with it. Factors influencing maternal health Logo of alt=Logo depicting pregnant woman, used in Millennium Development Goal 5, maternal health  Poverty and access to healthcare  According to a UNFPA report, social and economic status, culture norms and values, and geographic remoteness all increase a maternal mortality, and the risk for maternal death (during pregnancy or childbirth) in sub-Saharan Africa is 175 times higher than in developed countries, and risk for pregnancy- related illnesses and negative consequences after birth is even higher. Poverty, maternal health, and outcomes for the child are all interconnected. Women living in poverty-stricken areas are more likely to be obese and engage in unhealthy behaviors such as cigarette smoking and drug use, are less likely to engage in or even have access to legitimate prenatal care, and are at a significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child. A study conducted in Kenya observed that common maternal health problems in poverty-stricken areas include hemorrhaging, anemia, hypertension, malaria, placenta retention, premature labor, prolonged/complicated labor, and pre- eclampsia. Generally, adequate prenatal care encompasses medical care and educational, social, and nutritional services during pregnancy. Although there are a variety of reasons women choose not to engage in proper prenatal care, 71% of low-income women in a US national study had difficulties getting access to prenatal care when they sought it out. Additionally, immigrants and Hispanic women are at higher risk than white or black women for receiving little to no prenatal care, where level of education is also an indicator (since education and race are correlated). Adolescents are least likely to receive any prenatal care at all. Throughout several studies, women and adolescents ranked inadequate finances and lack of transportation as the most common barriers to receiving proper prenatal care. Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the Population Reference Bureau Income is strongly correlated with quality of prenatal care. Sometimes, proximity to healthcare facilities and access to transportation have significant effects on whether or not women have access to prenatal care. An analysis conducted on maternal healthcare services in Mali found that women who lived in rural areas, far away from healthcare facilities were less likely to receive prenatal care than those who lived in urban areas. Furthermore, researchers found an even stronger relationship between lack of transportation and prenatal and delivery care. In addition to proximity being a predictor of prenatal care access, Materia and colleagues found similar results for proximity and antenatal care in rural Ethiopia.. Also, inadequate and poor quality services contributes in increasing maternal morbidity and mortality.  Pre-existing conditions  HIV/AIDS Maternal HIV rates vary around the world, ranging from 1% to 40%, with African and Asian countries having the highest rates. Whilst maternal HIV infection largely has health implications for the child, especially in countries where poverty is high and education levels are low, having HIV/AIDS while pregnant can also cause heightened health risks for the mother. A large concern for HIV-positive pregnant women is the risk of contracting tuberculosis (TB) and/or malaria, in developing countries.. 28% of maternal deaths are from obstructed labour and indirect causes, meaning diseases that complicate pregnancy or that are complicated by pregnancy(malaria, anemia, HIV/AIDS), and cardiovascular diseases). Maternal weight During pregnancy, women of an average pre- pregnancy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) should expect to gain between 25-35 pounds over the course of the pregnancy. Increased rates of hypertension, diabetes, respiratory complications, and infections are prevalent in cases of maternal obesity and can have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes., cited in Obesity is an extremely strong risk factor for gestational diabetes. Research has found that obese mothers who lose weight (at least 10 pounds or 4.5 kg) in-between pregnancies reduce the risk of gestational diabetes during their next pregnancy, whereas mothers who gain weight actually increase their risk. Women who are pregnant should aim to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week, including muscle strengthening exercises. Oral hygiene Maternal Oral Health has been shown to affect the well-being of both the expectant mother and her unborn fetus.  Importance of good oral hygiene for maternal health  The 2000 Surgeon's General Report stressed the interdependence of oral health on the overall health and well-being of an individual. Oral health is especially essential during perinatal period and the future development of the child. Proper management of oral health has benefits to both mother and child. Furthermore, lack of understanding or maintenance of good oral health for pregnant women may have adverse effects on them and their children. Hence, it is imperative to educate mothers regarding the significance of oral health. Moreover, collaboration and support among physicians across various fields, especially among family practitioners and obstetricians, is essential in addressing the concerns for maternal oral health.Brown A. 2008. Access to Oral Health Care During the Prenatal Period: A Policy Brief. Washington, DC: National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center In 2007, the Maternal Oral Health Project was developed to provide routine oral care to low-income pregnant women in Nassau County, NY. Since its inception, the program has treated more than 2,000 pregnant women, many of whom had significant gum and/or tooth problems. Oral health has numerous implications on overall general health and the quality of life of an individual. The Surgeon General's Report lists various systemic diseases and conditions that have oral manifestations. The oral cavity serves as both a site of and a gateway entry of disease for microbial infections, which can affect general health status. In addition, some studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the report establishes a relationship between oral health and quality of life, including functional, psychosocial, and economic indicators. Poor oral health can affect diet, nutrition, sleep, psychological status, social interaction, school, and work.  Physiological oral changes during pregnancy  Protection and control of oral health and diseases safeguards a woman's health and quality of life before and during pregnancy. Also, it has the potential to decrease the transmission of pathogenic bacteria that occurs from mother to child. Along with pregnancy, come physiological changes for a woman. The changes, including fluctuating hormones, increase the woman's susceptibility to oral infections such as periodontal disease. This disease impairs the body's ability to repair and maintain soft tissues. It also causes indirect damage through bacterial induction of both inflammatory and immune responses of the host. During pregnancy, mild inflammation of the gums, \\"pregnancy gingivitis\\", is quite common and if left untreated can lead to periodontal disease. There have been an increased number of studies establishing associations between, periodontal disease and negative health outcomes, which include tooth loss, cardiovascular disease, stroke, poor diabetes control, and adverse birth outcomes. For example, one such study found that moderate or severe periodontal disease early in pregnancy was associated with delivery of small-for-gestational-age infant. Other studies have also found an association between periodontal disease and development of pre-eclampsia and pre-term births.  Maternal dental caries and its effects on child health  Another notable oral disease pertinent to maternal child health is dental caries. Dental caries is the process of tooth decay, and the development of what is commonly known as cavities. Dental caries are transmitted from mother to child vertically; colonization of cariogenic bacteria primarily occurs from mother to child through saliva-sharing activities. Maternal oral flora can ultimately foretell oral flora in offspring. In addition, other maternal factors such as social, behavioral, and biological factors can predispose a child's experience with tooth-decay. Some of these factors include the lack of knowledge a mother possesses concerning oral health, which can influence the development of caries among her children. Compared to children whose mothers have good oral health, children whose mothers have bad oral health are five times as likely to have poor oral health. Poor maintenance of oral health has profound implications on the development of children. As mentioned in the Surgeon's General Report, oral health affects the quality of life, especially children, with respect to functional, psychological, economic, and overall emotional well-being of an individual. To demonstrate the adverse effects of poor oral health, take for example the consequences a simple cavity can have on a child. First, it is painful. This might cause a child to miss school or have poor concentration, eventually compromising school performance. In addition, due to the pain, it might result in poor weight gain or growth. Also, children may exhibit reduced self-esteem because of cosmetic issues. Furthermore, it can affect language and impair speech. Impaired speech development can also result in low self- esteem. Finally, cavities although easily preventable, can pose a financial burden of a family. Public dental services are scarce and costly to individuals who lack dental insurance. It may also result in unwarranted visits to emergency department. Poor oral health permeates into other aspects of life, posing threats to overall well-being, if not handled timely and effectively  Factors for not seeking oral health services and how to overcome them  The significance of oral health is apparent, however, many women do not receive dental services before, during, and after pregnancy, even with obvious signs of oral disease. There are several factors at play regarding pregnant women not seeking dental care, including the role of the health care system and disposition of the woman herself. There is a common misconception that it is not safe to obtain dental services while pregnant. Many prenatal and oral health providers have limited knowledge about the impact and safety of delivering dental services; hence they might delay or withhold treatment during pregnancy. Moreover, some prenatal providers are not aware of the importance of oral health on overall general health, thus failing to refer their patients to dental providers. First and foremost, the misconception regarding the impact of dental services while a woman is pregnant needs to be purged. There is a consensus that prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral diseases are highly beneficial and can be performed on pregnant women having no added fetal or maternal risk when compared to the risk of providing no oral care. Equally important is establishing collaboration among clinicians, especially maternal health providers, with other dental providers. There should be coordination among general health and oral health providers, especially because of the interdependence of the two fields. Thus, it is imperative to educate and train health providers of the significance of oral health, designing methods to incorporate in their respective practices. Providers most provide education to pregnant women addressing the importance of oral health, because these women ultimately control the fate of themselves and their offspring. For example, providers can illustrate to mothers how to reduce cavities by wiping down the gums of their children with a soft cloth after breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Bestowing knowledge and practical applications of good oral health maintenance measures to mothers can help improve overall health of the mother and child. There are still other factors in play when analyzing the low use of dental services by pregnant women, particularly prevalent among ethnic and racial minorities. A major factor is the lack of insurance and or access to dental services. For this reason, more data needs to be collected and analyzed so that programs are set up to effectively to reach all segments of the population.  Race and ethnicity  The pregnancy related mortality ratio (PRMR) represents the number of deaths per 100,000 live births resulting from pregnancy or pregnancy related causes. Analysis of the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), indicates significant racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy related deaths. Specifically, A 2019 report from the CDC shows that the PRMRs of Black women and American Indian women in the United States are 3-4 times higher than that of White women. For White women during 2019, there were an approximate 13 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. For Black and American Indian women, there were 41 and 30 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births respectively. The majority of these deaths were due to preventable diseases associated with pregnancy related mortality, such as hypertension. While the fatality rate of these diseases was higher among Black and American Indian women, the initial prevalence was generally the same across all races. Although lower than that of Black and American Indian women, the PRMR for Asian and Pacific Islander women was found to be higher than that of White women (with a disparity ratio of 1.1). The PRMR for Hispanic women has shown a decline in recent years. However, state specific reports show that Hispanic women face high rates of maternal morbidity. The CDC cites multiple possible causes for the racial gap in maternal mortality. They say that most pregnancy related deaths are the combined result of 3-4 contributing factors. For Black and American Indian women, this can include issues of implicit racial bias held by healthcare providers, which affects the quality of care given to treat or prevent a fatal disease. These factors can also be more structural (e.g. the gap in access to primary and preventative care in minority communities). In the CDC report, economic status is not cited as a leading cause of maternal mortality. While economic status and education level is a possible contributing factors to maternal mortality, the racial gap is shown to persist across all economic and education levels.  Religion  There are many factors that influence maternal health and the access of resources. One of these factors that recent studies have highlighted is religion. For example, one such study stated that, due to the insensitivity and lack of knowledge that physicians showed immigrant Muslim women in Canada, their health information and treatment suffered. The health care that they received from physicians did not provide information in respect to their religious or cultural practices and did little to provide cultural adjustments and emotional support. In order to provide a safer and more comfortable environment for Muslim women, it was proven that they needed more support that would connect with the immigrant community and health-related information. Discrimination based on religion is a factor that effects the maternal health care of women from different backgrounds. There is not a lot of discussion on the studies that reflect the hardships that women go through in terms of their religion and maternal care. Stigmatizing certain maternal and reproductive practices is common within the context of religion. For example, in a study that focused on interviewing women who have had abortions, one participant used the word ‚Äúguilt‚Äù 16 times in her one hour interview. She cited that the cause of her guilt was because of her Catholic upbringing. The overall data showed that there was a strong relationship between religion and self-stigma. Among the women who identified as a practicing Christian, 65% made statements that proved self-stigma effects. There is a lot of stigma and norms regarding religion that, in turn, place women at risk when receiving health-care. Other religious practices and traditions have shown to influence maternal health in a negative way. Practitioners of apostolicism in Zimbabwe have been associated with higher maternal mortality. Results of a study showed the dangerous associations that religion may have on maternal health. The general trend shows that Apostolicism promotes high fertility, early marriage, non-use of contraceptives and low or non-use of hospital care. There are delays in recognizing danger signs, deciding to seek care and receiving appropriate health care. Future studies can look at how societal traditions or expectations such as gender roles may combine with religion to result in poorer maternal health care. Although factors of religion can negatively influence maternal health care, other studies show the necessity of understanding different religious beliefs and practices. In Ghana, interviews of women showed the benefits of transparent religious beliefs and practices while pregnant and in labor. Spiritual interventions done by pastors in pregnancy included prayer, revelations, reversing negative dreams, laying of hands and anointing women. Religious artifacts used among the women during pregnancy and labor were anointing oil, blessed water, stickers, blessed white handkerchief, blessed sand, Bible and Rosary. The women made many connections to these practices and to their religion such as God having the capability to reduce labor pain and to provide a safe and successful delivery. The results concluded that spirituality is an integral part of the care of pregnant women in Ghana. In order to ensure the safety of these women, their religious practices should not be in secrecy. The presence of artifacts infer that women do not have the freedom to practice their religion at home. It was concluded that pastors should be sensitive to their role in the labor process and that revelations and spiritual interventions should not lead to pregnancy or labor complications. Future studies in religion and maternal health care will focus on the role of pastors, familiar support, and the views of midwives or health care professionals in different societies around the world. Effects on child health and development Prenatal health Prenatal care is an important part of basic maternal health care. It is recommended expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits, in which a health worker can check for signs of ill health ‚Äì such as underweight, anaemia or infection ‚Äì and monitor the health of the foetus. During these visits, women are counseled on nutrition and hygiene to improve their health prior to, and following, delivery. They can also develop a birth plan laying out how to reach care and what to do in case of an emergency. Poverty, malnutrition, and substance abuse may contribute to impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral problems across childhood. In other words, if a mother is not in optimal health during the prenatal period (the time while she is pregnant) and/or the fetus is exposed to teratogen(s), the child is more likely to experience health or developmental difficulties, or death. The environment in which the mother provides for the embryo/fetus is critical to its wellbeing well after gestation and birth. A teratogen is \\"any agent that can potentially cause a birth defect or negatively alter cognitive and behavioral outcomes.\\" Dose, genetic susceptibility, and time of exposure are all factors for the extent of the effect of a teratogen on an embryo or fetus. Prescription drugs taken during pregnancy such as streptomycin, tetracycline, some antidepressants, progestin, synthetic estrogen, and Accutane, as well as over-the-counter drugs such as diet pills, can result in teratogenic outcomes for the developing embryo/fetus. Additionally, high dosages of aspirin are known to lead to maternal and fetal bleeding, although low-dose aspirin is usually not harmful. Newborns whose mothers use heroin during the gestational period often exhibit withdrawal symptoms at birth and are more likely to have attention problems and health issues as they grow up. Use of stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine during pregnancy are linked to a number of problems for the child such as low birth weight and small head circumference and motor and cognitive developmental delays, as well as behavioral problems across childhood. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found that 6 year-olds whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy scored lower on an intelligence test than children whose mothers had not. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy can have a multitude of detrimental effects on the health and development of the offspring. Common results of smoking during pregnancy include pre-term births, low birth weights, fetal and neonatal deaths, respiratory problems, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), as well as increased risk for cognitive impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems. Also, in a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy experienced a 22% risk increase for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although alcohol use in careful moderation (one to two servings a few days a week) during pregnancy are not generally known to cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), the US Surgeon General advises against the consumption of alcohol at all during pregnancy. Excessive alcohol use during pregnancy can cause FASD, which commonly consist of physical and cognitive abnormalities in the child such as facial deformities, defective limbs, face, and heart, learning problems, below average intelligence, and intellectual disability (ID). Although HIV/AIDS can be transmitted to offspring at different times, the most common time that mothers pass on the virus is during pregnancy. During the perinatal period, the embryo/fetus can contract the virus through the placenta. Gestational diabetes is directly linked with obesity in offspring through adolescence. Additionally, children whose mothers had diabetes are more likely to develop Type II diabetes. Mothers who have gestational diabetes have a high chance of giving birth to very large infants (10 pounds or more). Because the embryo or fetus's nutrition is based on maternal protein, vitamin, mineral, and total caloric intake, infants born to malnourished mothers are more likely to exhibit malformations. Additionally, maternal stress can affect the fetus both directly and indirectly. When a mother is under stress, physiological changes occur in the body that could harm the developing fetus. Additionally, the mother is more likely to engage in behaviors that could negatively affect the fetus, such as tobacco smoking, drug use, and alcohol abuse. Childbirth and sexually transmitted infections Genital herpes can be passed to the offspring through the birth canal during delivery. In pregnancies where the mother is infected with the virus, 25% of babies delivered through an infected birth canal become brain damaged, and 1/3 die. HIV/AIDS can also be transmitted during childbirth through contact with the mother's body fluids. Mothers in developed countries may often elect to undergo a caesarean section to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through the birth canal, but this option is not always available in developing countries. Postpartum period Globally, more than eight million of the 136 million women giving birth each year suffer from excessive bleeding after childbirth. This condition‚Äîmedically referred to as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)‚Äîcauses one out of every four maternal deaths that occur annually and accounts for more maternal deaths than any other individual cause. Deaths due to postpartum hemorrhage disproportionately affect women in developing countries. For every woman who dies from causes related to pregnancy, an estimated 20 to 30 encounter serious complications. At least 15 per cent of all births are complicated by a potentially fatal condition. Women who survive such complications often require lengthy recovery times and may face lasting physical, psychological, social and economic consequences. Although many of these complications are unpredictable, almost all are treatable. During the postpartum period, many mothers breastfeed their infants. Transmission of HIV/AIDS through breastfeeding is a huge issue in developing countries, namely in African countries. The majority of infants who contract HIV through breast milk do so within the first six weeks of life., in despite of that Antiretroviral treatment (during pregnancy, delivery and during breastfeeding) Reduces transmission risk by >90% . However, in healthy mothers, there are many benefits for infants who are breastfed. The World Health Organization recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years of life, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend that mothers do so for at least the first six months, and continue as long as is mutually desired. Infants who are breastfed by healthy mothers (not infected with HIV/AIDS) are less prone to infections such as Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneunoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Giardia lamblia, group B streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus-1, as well as gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media. Lower rates of infant mortality are observed in breastfed babies in addition to lower rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Decreases in obesity and diseases such as childhood metabolic disease, asthma, atopic dermatitis, Type I diabetes, and childhood cancers are also seen in children who are breastfed. Following up on the women who have given birth is a crucial factor as it helps check on maternal health. Since healthcare facilities have records of the women who have given birth, when the women are followed to monitor the progress of their babies as well as their health, it becomes easy to put them on a follow-up and ensure they are doing well as the baby grows. Follow up is accompanied by nutritional advice to ensure both the mother and her baby are in good condition. This prevents sickness that may affect the two and deteriorate their health.  Recommended Maternal Health Practices  Maternal health care and care of the fetus starts with prenatal health. The World Health Organization suggests that the first step towards health is a balanced diet which includes a mix of vegetables, meat, fish, nuts, whole grains, fruits and beans. Additionally, Iron supplements and folic acid are recommended to be taken by pregnant women daily. These supplements are recommended by the US Surgeon General to help prevent birth complications for mothers and babies such as low birth weight, anemia, hypertension and pre- term birth. Folic acid can aid neural tube formation in a fetus, which happens early in gestation and therefore should be recommended as soon as possible. Calcium and Vitamin A supplements are also recommended when those compounds are not available or only available in low doses in the natural diet but other supplements such as Vitamins D, E, C, and B6 are not recommended. The WHO also suggests that low impact exercise and reduction of caffeine intake to less than 330 mg/day can help to reduce the likelihood of neonatal morbidity. Light exercise should be continued for pregnant mothers as it has been recommended to combat negative health outcomes, side effects and birth complications related to obesity. Should possible side effects of a pregnancy occur, such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, leg cramps, lower back pain, and constipation; low intensity exercise, balanced diet, or natural herb supplements are recommended by the WHO to mitigate the side effects. the US Surgeon General recommends abstaining from consuming alcohol or nicotine in any form throughout the duration of one's pregnancy, and to avoid using it as a way to mitigate some of the side effects of pregnancy mentioned earlier. During a pregnancy, women should receive continuous care from a physician to monitor the growth and status of the fetus. Maternal health organizations suggest that at a minimum pregnant women should receive one ultrasound at week 24 to help predict any possible growth anomalies and prevent future gestational concerns. It is also stated that pregnant women should also fulfill any missing vaccinations as soon as possible including the tetanus vaccine and influenza vaccine. For pregnant women who are at an increased risk for preeclampsia, one could take a dietary supplement of low dose aspirin before 20 weeks gestation. In the case of a healthy vaginal birth, mothers and babies typically are recommended to stay at the hospital for 24 hours before departing. This is suggested to allow time to assess the mother and child for any possible complications such as bleeding or additional contractions. The WHO recommends that babies should have checkups with a physician on day 3, day 7-14 and 6 weeks after birth. At these follow up appointments the emotional well-being of the mother should also be considered. Special attention to the possibility of postpartum depression, which affects 10-15% of mothers in 40 countries is also recommended by the WHO. At these check ins mothers also have the opportunity to seek consultation from a physician about starting the breastfeeding process.  Long-term effects for the mother  Maternal health problems include complications from childbirth that do not result in death. For every woman that dies during childbirth, approximately 20 suffer from infection, injury, or disability. Around 75% of women who die in childbirth would be alive today if they had access to pregnancy prevention and healthcare interventions. Black women are more likely to experience pregnancy related deaths as well as receiving less effective medical care during pregnancy. Almost 50% of the births in developing countries still take place without a medically skilled attendant to aid the mother, and the ratio is even higher in South Asia. Women in Sub-Saharan Africa mainly rely on traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who have little or no formal health care training. In recognition of their role, some countries and non-governmental organizations are making efforts to train TBAs in maternal health topics, in order to improve the chances for better health outcomes among mothers and babies. Breastfeeding provides women with several long-term benefits. Women who breastfeed experience better glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure, and lose pregnancy weight faster than those who do not. Additionally, women who breastfeed experience lower rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding provides substantial benefits to women who are not infected with HIV. In countries where HIV/AIDS rates are high, such as South Africa and Kenya, the virus is a leading cause of maternal mortality, especially in mothers who breastfeed. A complication is that many HIV-infected mothers cannot afford formula, and thus have no way of preventing transmission to the child through breast milk or avoiding health risks for themselves. In cases like this, mothers have no choice but to breastfeed their infants regardless of their knowledge of the harmful effects.  Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) Maternal Mortality Rate worldwide, as defined by the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental or incidental causes.Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate in The CIA World Factbook. Date of Information: 2010 Worldwide, the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) which defined as deaths per 100,000 live births per time-period has decreased, with South- East Asia seeing the most dramatic decrease of 59% and Africa seeing a decline of 27%. There are no regions that are on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal of decreasing maternal mortality by 75% by the year 2015. Maternal mortality--a sentinel event In a September 2016 ACOG/SMFM consensus, published concurrently in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology and by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), they noted that while they did not yet have a \\"single, comprehensive definition of severe maternal morbidity\\" (SMM), the rate of SMM is increasing in the United States as is maternal mortality. Both are \\"associated with a high rate of preventability.\\" The U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations calls maternal mortality a \\"sentinel event\\", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system. Maternal mortality data is said to be an important indicator of overall health system quality because pregnant women survive in sanitary, safe, well-staffed and stocked facilities. If new mothers are thriving, it indicates that the health care system is doing its job. If not, problems likely exist. According to Garret, increasing maternal survival, along with life expectancy, is an important goal for the world health community, as they show that other health issues are also improving. If these areas improve, disease-specific improvements are also better able to positively impact populations. MMR in developing countries Maternal health clinic in Afghanistan (source: Merlin) Decreasing the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in developing countries is important because poor maternal health is both an indicator and a cause of extreme poverty. According to Tamar Manuelyan Atinc, Vice President for Human Development at the World Bank:UN HEALTH AGENCIES: \\"Maternal deaths worldwide drop by a third\\" > \\"Maternal deaths are both caused by poverty and are a cause of it. The costs > of childbirth can quickly exhaust a family's income, bringing with it even > more financial hardship.\\" In many developing countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age. A woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute. According to the World Health Organization, in its World Health Report 2005, poor maternal conditions account for the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Most maternal deaths and injuries are caused by biological processes, not from disease, which can be prevented and have been largely eradicated in the developed world ‚Äî such as postpartum hemorrhaging, which causes 34% of maternal deaths in the developing world but only 13% of maternal deaths in developed countries. Although high-quality, accessible health care has made maternal death a rare event in developed countries, where only 1% of maternal deaths occur, these complications can often be fatal in the developing world because single most important intervention for safe motherhood is to make sure that a trained provider with midwifery skills is present at every birth, that transport is available to referral services, and that quality emergency obstetric care is available. In 2008 342,900 women died while pregnant or from childbirth worldwide. Although a high number, this was a significant drop from 1980, when 526,300 women died from the same causes. This improvement was caused by lower pregnancy rates in some countries; higher income, which improves nutrition and access to health care; more education for women; and the increasing availability of \\"skilled birth attendants\\" ‚Äî people with training in basic and emergency obstetric care ‚Äî to help women give birth. The situation was especially led by improvements in large countries like India and China, which helped to drive down the overall death rates. In India, the government started paying for prenatal and delivery care to ensure access, and saw successes in reducing maternal mortality, so much so that India is cited as the major reason for the decreasing global rates of maternal mortality. MMR in developed countries Until the early 20th century developed and developing countries had similar rates of maternal mortality. Since most maternal deaths and injuries are preventable, they have been largely eradicated in the developed world. In developed countries, Black (non-Latina) women have higher maternal mortality rates than White (non-Latina) women. According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene - Bureau of Maternal, Infant and Reproductive Health, it was found that from 2008 to 2012, Black (non-Latina) women have a pregnancy-related mortality rate twelve times higher than White (non-Latina) women. The U.S. has the \\"highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world.\\" It is also estimated that 50% of the deaths are from preventable causes. Since 2016, ProPublica and NPR investigated factors that led to the increase in maternal mortality in the United States.

The Sustainable Development Goals and Maternal Mortality  In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), countries have united behind a new target to accelerate the decline of maternal mortality by 2030. SDG 3 includes an ambitious target: ‚Äúreducing the global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 births, with no country having a maternal mortality rate of more than twice the global average‚Äù.  Proposed solutions  The World Bank estimated that a total of 3.00 US dollars per person a year can provide basic family planning and both maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries.Global Health Council: Women's Health Many non-profit organizations have programs educating the public and gaining access to emergency obstetric care for mothers in developing countries. The United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) recently began its Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA), focusing on providing quality healthcare to mothers. One of the programs within CARMMA is Sierra Leone providing free healthcare to mothers and children. This initiative has widespread support from African leaders and was started in conjunction with the African Union Health Ministers.UNFPA: \\"Creating Good CARMMA for African Mothers\\" Improving maternal health is the fifth of the United Nations' eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), targeting a reduction in the number of women dying during pregnancy and childbirth by three quarters by 2015, notably by increasing the usage of skilled birth attendants, contraception and family planning.United Nations: \\"Investing in the health of Africa's mothers\\" The current decline of maternal deaths is only half of what is necessary to achieve this goal, and in several regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa the maternal mortality rate is actually increasing. However, one country that may meet their MDG 5 is Nepal, which has it appears reduced its maternal mortality by more than 50% since the early 1990s.Jakob Engel, Jonathan Glennie, Shiva Raj Adhikari, Sanju Wagle Bhattarai, Devi Prasad Prasai and Fiona Samuels, Nepal's Story, Understanding improvements in maternal health, March 2014 As the 2015 deadline for the MDG's approaches, an understanding of the policy developments leading to the inclusion of maternal health within the MDG's is essential for future advocacy efforts. According to the UNFPA, maternal deaths would be reduced by about two-thirds, from 287,000 to 105,000, if needs for modern family planning and maternal and newborn health care were met. Therefore, investing in family planning and improved maternal health care brings many benefits including reduced risks of complications and improvement in health for mothers and their children. Education is also critical with research showing \\"that women with no education were nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than women who had finished secondary school.\\" Evidence shows that women who are better educated tend to have healthier children. Education would also improve employment opportunities for women which results in improving their status, contributing to family savings, reducing poverty and contributing to economic growth. All of these invests bring significant benefits and effects not only for women and girls but also their children, families, communities and their country. Developed countries had rates of maternal mortality similar to those of developing countries until the early 20th century, therefore several lessons can be learned from the west. During the 19th century Sweden had high levels of maternal mortality, and there was a strong support within the country to reduce mortality rate to fewer than 300 per 100,000 live births. The Swedish government began public health initiatives to train enough midwives to attend all births. This approach was also later used by Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands who also experienced similar successes. Increasing contraceptive usage and family planning also improves maternal health through reduction in numbers of higher risk pregnancies and by lowering the inter-pregnancy interval. In Nepal a strong emphasis was placed on providing family planning to rural regions and it was shown to be effective. Madagascar saw a dramatic increase in contraceptive use after instituting a nationwide family planning program, the rate of contraceptive use increased from 5.1% in 1992 to 29% in 2008. Family planning has been reported to be a significant factor in maternal health. Governments should invest in their national healthcare to ensure that all women are aware of birth control methods. The government, through the ministry of health, should liaise with the private healthcare as well as the public healthcare division to ensure that women are educated and encouraged to use the right family planning method (Bloom, David, and Klaus Prettner 5). The government should invest in this operation as when the rate of underage, as well as unplanned pregnancies, are reduced the healthcare cost stand a chance to drop by up to 8%. Healthcare will, therefore, be in a position to handle the other women who give birth. This will result in an improvement in maternal health. Four elements are essential to maternal death prevention. First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and foetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are haemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker is assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.

However following the closure of that institute, he joined Alexander Duff's General Assembly's Institution in 1875.Reformist Modernism in The Brahmo Samaj and the shaping of the modern Indian mind. By David Kopf, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1979. page 80-83 In 1879, he joined Anandamohan Bose's City School as a teacher. Late in 1883, he joined the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj's institute of theology as its secretary, and was associated with its activities for twelve years. During this period he explored comparative discourses on Brahmo theology and religion. He was elected president of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1926. Religious positions Following his extensive readings, and intellectual exchanges with his peers, he developed the view that the failure of Brahmoism to draw converts lay in its being less philosophic, and being more grounded on dogma, based on divine inspiration and unverifiable assertions. To counter this, he put forward the need for developing a faith based on philosophy. In his written works, he developed a theological system of Brahmoism. This was based not on natural intuition or spontaneity, but on the metaphysics of theism and self-knowledge, based on the Upanishads and the Vedanta. By emphasizing the primacy of ethical development as instrumental to the formation of consciousness, his thoughts presaged those of Vivekananda. Controversies He attacked Vaishnava religion as he felt that natural or spontaneous religion based on the traditions of bhakti did not help in the development of critical rational faculties, and paradoxically served to keep the masses illiterate, and uncritical. His critical appraisal of Brahmo followers (primarily the followers of Keshub Chunder Sen's New Dispensation) as spiritual deviants, and his emphasis on logical empiricism earned him detractors both with the Brahmo Samaj (particularly the followers of Keshub Chunder Sen), and in the wider Hindu society, who criticized his efforts as effete scholasticism.

She was canonized by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839. Life Early life She was born Orsola [Ursula] Giuliani at Mercatello in the Duchy of Urbino on 27 December 1660. Her parents were Francesco and Benedetta Mancini Giuliani. She was the youngest of seven sisters, three of whom embraced the monastic life. It is told that at the age of three years Giuliani supposedly began to show great compassion for the poor. She would set apart a portion of her food for them, and even part with her clothes when she met a poor child scantily clad.Hess, Lawrence. \\"St. Veronica Giuliani\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 21 Nov. 2012 Her mother died when Ursula was seven years of age. When others did not readily join in her religious practices she was inclined to be dictatorial. At the age of 16, she experienced a vision which corrected this imperfection of character: she saw her own heart as a \\"heart of steel\\". In her writings she confesses that she took a certain pleasure in the more stately circumstances which her family adopted when her father was appointed superintendent of finance at Piacenza. When Giuliani came of age, her father believed she should marry, and so he desired her to take part in the social activities of the young people. But she pleaded so earnestly with her father that, after much resistance, he finally permitted her to choose her own state in life.Habig, Marion. ofm, ed., The Franciscan Book of Saints (1959) Franciscan Herald Press Life in the monastery In 1677, at the age of 17, Giuliani was received into the monastery of the Capuchin Poor Clares in Citt√† di Castello in Umbria, Italy, taking the name of Veronica in memory of the Passion. At the conclusion of the ceremony of her reception, the bishop said to the abbess: \\"I commend this new daughter to your special care, for she will one day be a great saint.\\" Giuliani became absolutely submissive to the will of her spiritual directors, though her novitiate was marked by extraordinary interior trials and temptations to return to the world. In her first years in the monastery, she worked in the kitchen, infirmary and sacristy and also served as portress. At the age of 34, she was made novice mistress.Foley, Leonard. \\"St. Veronica Giuliani\\", Saint of the Day For fifty years, Giuliani lived in the Capuchin convent. With gritty determination tempered by humility, she led her sisters as novice mistress for thirty-four years and as abbess for eleven. Giuliani governed the convent with obvious common sense and guided the novices with prudence. She would not allow them to read mystical books, requiring them instead to study books on Christian basics. In 1716, she was elected abbess. As a practical woman, she improved her sisters‚Äô comfort by enlarging the convent rooms and having water piped inside.Saints Stories for All Ages, Loyola Press Spiritual trials Giuliani had a lifelong devotion to Christ crucified that eventually became manifested in physical signs. The marks of the crown of thorns appeared on her forehead in 1694 and the five wounds on her body in 1697. Giuliani was humiliated by the stigmata itself and by her bishop‚Äôs rigorous testing of her experience. He removed her from ordinary community life and put her under constant observation. When he determined that the phenomena were authentic, he allowed her to return to normal convent life and continue her service to her sisters. She died on 9 July 1727 at Citt√† di Castello. Veneration After Giuliani's death a figure of the Cross was supposedly found impressed upon her heart, and her body has been noted as being incorrupt. She was beatified by Pope Pius VII on 17 June 1804 and was canonized by Pope Gregory XVI on 26 May 1839. She is usually represented in art crowned with thorns and embracing the Cross. Giuliani's \\"rebirth\\" in Lebanon began with the devotion of a Lebanese religious, Brother Emmanuel, who came upon her writings in 1994 while serving at a monastery in Deir al-Zour, Syria. Emmanuel founded a religious order, the Little Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, in 2015 and he believes Giuliani \\"has chosen Lebanon as a country to begin, or to intensify, her mission because Lebanon loves Our Lady a lot and has a very deep relationship with Mary.\\" As of 2016, there are seven nuns and four brothers in the order. Banners throughout the country proclaimed \\"A saint rises up in Lebanon!\\" heralding the first church in the world outside of Italy dedicated to Saint Veronica Giuliani.

It lies on the opposite side of the River Medway to Rochester, and at various times in its history has been considered fully or partially part of the City of Rochester. Frindsbury refers to both a parish and a manor. Within the civil parish of Frindsbury Extra are the villages of Frindsbury, Wainscott, and Upnor. Frindsbury was also the name given to an electoral ward in the City of Rochester that straddled the parishes of Frindsbury and Strood. Frindsbury started as a small agricultural community, grew into a significant industrial centre and declined into a dormitory suburb, each generation erasing the traces of the previous. Topology Frindsbury Church from Church Green, showing behind the chalk cliffs formed by quarrying. In the far distance is Chatham, showing how closely the Medway Towns are interlinked. Frindsbury lies on the northwest bank of the Medway at its lowest bridging point. After a narrow but marshy coastal strip, the land rises steeply to plateau at about . This was a sheet of chalk covered by brickearth covered with topsoil. Over the last two millennia, much of this was stripped away, or mined, so the contours have constantly changed. Through the centre of this ran a shallow valley carrying a stream draining the Hoo Peninsula behind, through Islingham to Whitewall creek where it entered the Medway. This water flow formed a river meander upstream and a build up of alluvium pushing 1,000 yds into the river. Though rarely more than in height, the Frindsbury peninsula became the centre of many industries. At the Strood end the coastal marsh became 600 yds wide. There is evidence of Roman piling so they could build a road, Watling Street, from Strood Hill across the marsh to the Medway which they bridge. At that time Strood was part of Frindsbury. The impenetrable nature and the steepness of the topography here influenced the route of the railways. History Here we see how Strood the marshy place, relates to Frindsbury. The station, canal basin and all the wharves downstream of the Watermill were in Frindsbury. The steep slopes are caused by the chalk pits. Note also the undrained land between the railway, and Frindsbury Hill, and the lack of houses. The word Frindsbury comes from Old English, freodesburh, meaning a stronghold held by a friend or ally. Recorded documented names of the parish include Freondesbrei (764), Freondesberia (c975), Frandesberie (1086), Fryndesbury (1610). The main parish church, All Saints, was built on the hill. There was a chapel of ease at Strood (St Nicholas'), where Watling Street left the firm ground to run over the marshes to the Medway bridge. Strood was promoted to a full parish in 1193 by Gilbert Glanvill, Bishop of Rochester. Prehistory The remains of a large elephant skeleton (palaeoloxodon antiquus) were excavated in 1911 at Upnor. In 1925, evidence of a palaeolithic flint works in the quarry to the east of All Saints church was reported. The find included over 4000 stone tools dating from 300,000 BP, including hand axes, large flint flakes, core pieces, and quartzite hammer stones. A Bronze Age sword was discovered at Upnor. Michael Nightingale in 1953 argued that there was a Roman Villa at Frindsbury to produce food to supply the garrison at Durobriv√¶, modern Rochester, Kent. The foundations of the road leading from this villa to the bridge were discovered in 1819 at the canal dock. Further excavation by Tingey in 1888 produced several artefacts. including a bronze statue of cupid 5.25\\" high. Middle Ages Bishop Eardulf of Rochester obtained Freandisbery and Wicham in 747. Notwithstanding this in 764, King Offa of Mercia (as overlord) and Sigered (the petty king of this part of Kent) granted 20 sulungs of land at Aeslingham in Freodesbrei to Bishop Eardulf of Rochester. In 778, King Egbert gave more land to the Bishop. Following the Danish wars or the 9th and 10th century the area was wrested from the church and eventually came under the control of Harold Godwinson. Following Harold's defeat at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror gave the lands to Odo, bishop of Bayeux, Earl of Kent, and William's half brother. Archbishop Lanfranc recovered them again at the Trial of Penenden Heath (c.1072) and restored them to Bishop Gundulf of Rochester. Gundulf was responsible for commencing the rebuilding of Rochester Cathedral and establishing the Benedictine Priory of St Andrew based upon it. He gave the land at Fridsbury to the new priory though insisting they paid an exenium to him or his successors on St Andrews day. The Domesday book records Frindsbury as in the Lathe of Aylesford, in the Hundred of Shamwell. It had been taxed at 10 sulungs before 1066 and then at 7 in 1086. There were 15 carrucates of arable land, 5 held by the lord and 11 by the villagers . It supported 40 villagers, 28 smallholders and 9 slaves. There was a mill taxable at 12 shillings (60p), a church, of meadow and woodland for 5 pigs. It was worth ¬£8 before the conquest, but ¬£25 by 1086 with another 10 shillings (50p) for the Bishop. Bishop Gilbert de Glanvill claimed Frinsdsbury back from the monks \\"as belonging to the maintenance of his table\\" in 1185. According to Hasted the bishop succeeded in obtaining the church, but the manor remained in the possession of the monks until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1523. Barnard however records that in 1256, the church of Frindsbury (and thus the income) was returned to the Bishop. In 1279 and again in 1293, 1314 and 1357 the bishop of Rochester claimed liberties in the lands of the priory of Frindsbury as well as all lands belonging to the church. In 1348 the manor was confirmed as being in the possession of the prior of Rochester, reconfirmed in 1295. In 1287 the manor, along with its appendages of Chattenden, Strood and Rede, were taxed at ¬£24-6-8 (¬£24.33). Frindsbury Clubs. In 1291, there was an altercation between the Monks of Rochester and Newark Priory in Strood as a result of a communication difficulty. The good folk of Frindsbury soundly beat up the monks who were trespassing. However, the church sided with the monks, and on Whit Monday the Frindsbury lads had to do penance by walking to abbey and craving forgiveness carrying their clubs. This continued till none of the participants was alive. In the 18th century the boys of Frindsbury and Strood met up each May Day to have a faction fight, though it is unclear whether it was between themselves or against the boys from Rochester. Modern On 30 September 1894, the Local Government Board confirmed an order of Kent County Council, and Frindsbury civil parish was divided into Frindsbury Intra, and Frindsbury Extra. Intra joined the municipal borough of Rochester, while part of Frindsbury Extra joined Strood Rural District. The remaining part of Frindsbury Extra joined Rochester in 1934. Modern day Frindsbury is often referred to as North Strood as it lies within the borders of the very northern part of the town, contiguous to the village of Wainscott. Its population is included in Strood's approximate 40,000 residents. Although Frindsbury is considered part of Strood, the parish of Frindsbury Extra lies outside the borders of Strood and comes under Rochester. The parish includes Upnor, Hoo, Wainscott, Chattenden and various other small hamlets which are situated north of the main town Strood. Buildings The manor of Frindsbury The manor house is a grade II listed farmhouse dating from the late 16th century. In 1753 a new front was added to the existing building in the late Georgian style. The house consists of a central 3 storey block flanked by 2 storey wings. A 20th century porch has been added. This is also referred to as Court Lodge Farm. The building was proposed for demolition in 1958. Adjacent to the Manor house is an early fifteenth tithe barn. The barn is a grade I listed building at UK grid reference . In early 2003 the barn suffered a serious fire which destroyed four of its thirteen bays. The damaged and fallen timbers were salvaged during the following summer and are stored in the undamaged part of the barn. The barn is owned by the Church Commissioners who, prior to the fire, leased it to the farmer as an equipment store. Medieval structure View of the south end of the barn The official listing description is drawn from and ascribes a date of 1300. challenges this date on the basis of dendrochronological and radiocarbon dating performed in 2002. The former gives a felling date of 1403, the latter 1400 ¬± 60 years. The barn is of aisled construction and until the fire was by . The barn is notable for the quality of its construction: \\"the undoubted queen of the Kentish barns\\", \\"Its carpentry is peerless\\" (both quotes from to ) or Austin's view \\"exemplary and executed to a high standard\\". The footings are of mortared flint and stone rising to at the northern end of the barn. They may originally have been lime rendered internally. The heart of the structure is a series of rectangular frames (arcade posts and collar beams) rising approximately above the dwarf walls. The frames are transversely braced. Linking the tops of the frames longitudinally is the arcade plate which is jointed and braced to each upright. outside the arcade are the aisle posts (2m high) supporting an aisle tie to the main arcade posts. The aisle posts are linked by the eaves plate, though not braced to it. Resting on and braced to the collar beams are crown posts supporting a collar plate. The rafters are supported by the eaves plates, arcade plates and collar plates forming a single unbroken slope. To complete the exterior of the building, weatherboards run from under the eaves vertically down to the ground plates. The weatherboards are thought to be a rare survival of the original boards. A dendrochronological of one board gave 1357, but this was not the outermost ring of the tree. The roof may have been originally thatched but is now covered with peg tiles. The entire roof has been retiled on new battens during the 1970s though earlier hand made tiles have been reused alongside modern machine made tiles. Although the structure shows little sign of decay and replacement, the rafters above the aisles of bays 7 and 11 are of machine sawn softwood. In same bays, and also the lost bay 3, the medieval footings are also absent. Austin argues that this suggests the location of tall entrances (midstreys) at these points. Later changes Much of the barn's original footings have been replaced. The original footings are present in the first 5 bays, particularly at the east side. The footings in the west wall of bays 5 onwards were rebuilt in the 1970s. The rest consists of a mixture of eighteenth and nineteenth century repairs, often in brick. As well as the footings, parts of the ground plate and some weatherboards have been replaced. Some of this work was maintenance of the more vulnerable parts of the barn, but some reflected changing use. Notable amongst the changes were the blocking up of all the medieval doors and the insertion of later entrances. At various times low and high level partitions have been added. Evidence of this activity is present in chisel work, nail holes, mortices and the impression of boards in remaining timbers. Most of the floor is nineteenth century concrete with drainage channels. This appears to be associated with the housing of cattle. In other parts of the barn earthen and chalk floors can be found. In bays 8 and 9 worn cobbles and granite setts are again associated with animals, particularly with a nearby stable door and chewed timbers. Bay 11 has timber floors in each aisle. The timbers are hand sawn and old. Brick sleeper walls discovered by excavation indicate that the timber flooring may have continued across the whole width. Similar sleeper walls have been found in the damaged bay 3. Both these bays are thought to be the location of the medieval entrances and Austin suggests that they may have been threshing floors. Frindsbury Church stood on a hill overlooking the Medway. The hill has been extensively quarried leaving the distinctive cliffs. To the left of the church is Church Green. Directly in front of it is Strood Pier and the entrance to the Strood basin. To the right is the Frindsbury Peninsula, and the Phoenix Wharf and Lower Curel's Yard. The Church of All Saints The present church was started around 1075 by Paulinus, sacrist of Rochester who gave books and vestments to it. It was rebuilt in 1127. There was more building in the 14th century and around 1407. The church was extensively restored in 1884. An image of the church pre restoration is in the British Library. The church has recently been fitted with disabled access, a WC and a kitchenette to the rear of the nave. Quarry House Quarry House is first mentioned in 1575. Then there was an early 17th-century brick residence, which became a fashionable place for a visit, to observe the prospect. It was demolished in 1897 so that the chalk on which it stood could be extracted. Drawings of it were made before its destruction. A full history of the house was written in the late 19th. The Parsonage The purpose of a mediaeval church was to raise revenue for the Bishop (the same man being the Rector of Frindsbury), and the lands needed to be managed. The Bishop knowing the income would appoint a clerk in Holy Orders say mass and minister to the congregation- he would become the vicar. The rector would have a Parsonage, which could be rented out if he didn't use it. There was a parsonage in Bill Street, and by 1591 it was occupied by the Watson Family. It was demolished at an unknown date post 1930. Islingham Farm This was a significant rural community of which there are few remains. Royal Oak Pub The pub was first built in the late 17th century as a house. By 1754 it was in use as a public house. It was under threat of demolition for redevelopment, but on 24 May 2016 was listed Grade II. Industry Industrial history Frindsbury today is principally a dormitory suburb of Rochester with significant commercial activity on the Frindsbury Peninsula. The housing merges Frindsbury and Strood. The availability of such housing is to the part caused by the previous land usage. Until 1811, most inhabitants worked in agriculture, but by 1831, 90% worked in quarrying or manufacturing making this an industrial hot spot, well in advance of the rest of Kent. Wealth and poverty was thus dependent on the generosity of a handful of employers and the state of the national economy, boom and recession. As one industry abandoned the land it had despoiled, newer ones moved in and used the space, and finally this was turned over to housing. The streets bear the names of the previous elite. Frindsbury Mills The first recorded windmill was on a map of 1596. It was called the Quarry Mill, was 100 yds southeast of the church and was destroyed in 1850. It was a post mill. The next four Frindsbury mills were all owned by Mr Kimmins (c1845 et seq.). On Prospect Hill there were two mills. The first was called Manwaring's Mill, or Little Mill. It was a black tarred smock mill that drove four pairs of millstones. Next to it was the Great Mill or Rose's Mill. It was the highest in Kent with forty foot by nine-foot sails. Together the two mills produced 400 sacks of flour a week. Little Mill was struck by lightning and demolished in 1886. Great Mill was demolished in 1890. Kimmin's Mill (1819‚Äì1843), was a smock mill with no base. The land became a brick field. A man was killed by its sails. House Mill, also known as Kimmin's Mill or Frindsbury Mill, stood on Frindsbury Hill and was a black smock mill. It was demolished in 1931. Close by in Strood on Broom Hill were two more mills, Field Mill and Killick's Mill. Ship and barge building : See main article Shipbuilding in Frindsbury, Kent for details of ships and barges built in the Frindsbury area Thames and Medway Canal :See main article Thames and Medway Canal for details Sand The moulding sand from below Upnor parish church was used to make metal castings. It was of such a high quality that it was exported. Brickfields In 1847, there were 6 brickfields in Frindsbury. Three were at Manor Farm, two were at Whitewall Creek and one at Ten Gun Field Upnor. Top soil would be removed, the brickearth was removed and the topsoil replaced and farming continued or orchards were planted. Ten Gun Field was in operation in 1800 and produced around 2.5 million bricks annually over the period. Production peaked in 1844 when it produced 14 million, 1% of the national output. The bricks were Yellow Stock bricks, the colour produced by adding up to 17% chalk to the clay. The brick were graded as Firsts, Seconds (used for facings), Thirds (used for internals), Roughs (used for hardcore) and Chuffs that were unusable. Other later brickfields were at Barn Meadow (today's Sholden Road) which produced reds, Wickenden Brickyard by Cooling Road, and Frindsbury Brickyard owned by the West family (closed in 1931). The business declined when the Fletton clay at Peterborough began to be exploited. This clay contained 5% tar oil, so required less fuel to fire. The Frindsbury brickyards reverted to agriculture or were used for new housing. Cement Works Portland Cement is made from a mixture of chalk and clay containing alumina and silica. It was first manufactured in 1842 at Rotherhithe by William Aspdin, and the first site outside the Thames valley at which it was manufactured was on Limehouse Reach, Frindsbury. I. C. Johnson, who had previously made cement at Swanscombe, bought an oil mill at Frindsbury, and converted it to make cement, commencing on 1 May 1851. This became known as the Crown Works. Subsequently, six more cement works were built along Limehouse Reach, all using the chalk that forms the Frindsbury ridge, and alluvial clay from the Medway Estuary. The cement works were, from north to south: * Phoenix Works (started 1877) * Globe Works (1880) * Bridge Works (1885) * Crown Works (1851) * Quarry Works (1889) * Beehive Works (1880) * Beaver Works (1884) By 1904, when these works reached their greatest development, there were 132 kilns with 30 kiln chimneys, capable of making around 4000 tons of cement a week, and employed 800. All the works started as independent companies, but were gradually merged, and in 1900 the entire site was acquired by APCM, who renamed the site \\"Crown and Quarry Works\\". The works had limited raw materials, and its capacity was reduced to around half its peak size, before finally shutting down in 1963, after most of the chalk on the Frindsbury peninsula had been used up. The Formby Works (established 1862) was at Whitewall Creek and did not join the APCM. This produced initially 60 tons a week, and eventually 500 tons a week. As the chalk from Tower Hill declined, it was brought by barge from Halling. The Formby Works closed in 1909. Shooting the Bridge To get under the Rochester Bridge, without losing headway, barges would approach at speed and drop their mast, using the winch at the bow, and when safely under, raise it again. To do this required extra crew, so called 'Hufflers', who were taken on at Whitewall creek. They waited offshore in their skiffs which were then tethered to the barge. They helped lower and raise the mast so the barge could shoot the bridge. They were let off at Janes Creek or Temple Creek in Strood. Holes in the ground The Hill on which Frindsbury stands is riddled with holes. These are possibly from ancient mining or could be natural caves caused by water erosion. At various points these have opened up killing at least one woman as well as causing subsidence. Local government Half of Frindsbury was outside the borders of the City of Rochester hence the name Frindsbury Extra. The other half was within the city so was referred to as Frindsbury Intra, a name that has long disappeared, being called Frindsbury. This distinction is significant, Frindsbury was a ward in the City of Rochester, and in the City of Rochester- upon-Medway. Frindsbury Extra was a ward of Strood Rural District Council which was abolished in 1974. Eleven of the 16 Strood Rural parishes, joined Rochester City Council and Chatham Borough Council to become the Rochester- upon-Medway Borough Council which in 1978 became Rochester-upon-Medway City Council. The eleven parishes remained parished i.e. have an elected parish council, while former Rochester wards were not. This distinction means that the Electoral Commission will not allow any boundary change to the wards, whereby an elector loses or gains the right to vote in a parish election. Medway Council is a unitary authority established in 1998. Frindsbury is split in two local government level wards: Strood North and Strood Rural, each represented by three councillors from the Conservative Party (). Visitors William Hogarth with Samuel Scott visited Rochester in May 1732. Ebenezer Forest wrote a journal of the five-day trip containing the lines \\"we all proceeded merrily to Frendsbury\\". They examined the Frindsbury Church then walked to Upnor where Hogarth made a drawing of the beautiful and ancient Upnor Castle. They then examined the Ten Gun Battery and the Birds Nest Battery before walking to Hoo. In 1783, engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck drew their prospect of Rochester from the top of All Saints Church Tower.

Vigilant was designed by Nathanael Greene Herreshoff and built in 1893 by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company of Bristol, Rhode Island. She was Herreshoff's first victorious America's Cup defender design. Design Vigilant was a centerboard sloop with all-metal (steel and bronze) construction. She was owned by a syndicate led by Charles Oliver Iselin and which included Edwin Dennison Morgan, August Belmont, Jr., Cornelius Vanderbilt, Charles R. Flint, Chester W. Chapin, George R. Clark, Henry Astor Carey, Dr. Barton Hopkins, E.M. Fulton, Jr. and Adrian G Iselin. She was skippered by Nathanael Greene Herreshoff himself. Career Vigilant and Valkyrie II Launched on June 14, 1893, Vigilant beat Colonia, Jubilee, and Pilgrim to win the 1893 American selection trials for the America's Cup defense. In the 1893 America's Cup Vigilant faced Lord Dunraven's British keel cutter Valkyrie II in a best three out of five races format sailed on alternating courses. The races were sailed October 7, 9, and 13, 1893 off Sandy Hook, NJ just south of New York. The first and third races were 15 miles to windward off Scotland Lightship and return to leeward, the second race was a 30-mile equilateral triangle. Lord Dunraven's daughter became the first female to sail in an international yacht race in the United States. In the first race on October 7, in light air, Valkyrie II won the 11:25 am start by 15 seconds and one boat length. At the first mark, Vigilant held a nine-minute lead. Vigilant crossed the finish line 7 minutes ahead of Valkyrie II8 minutes 48 seconds in corrected time. In the second race on October 9, Vigilant won the 11:25 am start by 5 seconds, but Valkyrie II worked out to an early lead of 5 boat lengths in a building breeze. By the first mark, Vigilant held a five-minute lead and worked out to a 9-minute lead at the second mark. At the finish Vigilant beat Valkyrie II by 12 minutes 30 seconds10 minutes 35 seconds in corrected time. In the third race on October 13, 1893, Lord Dunraven, was facing elimination but was certain the Valkyrie II could equal or better Vigilant in the strong breeze. Valkyrie II led the windward leg, but lost a spinnaker at the two-thirds point of the downwind run. At the finish, Vigilant beat Valkyrie II by 40 seconds in corrected time to successfully defend the cup. The World reported it as the fastest race ever sailed, over a course of 15 miles to windward and return under reefed sail and a gale. In 1894 Vigilant was bought by Howard Gould and became the first America's Cup defender to sail in Europe for the British yachting season. In the Mount's Bay Regatta of July 28, 1894 the Vigilant was piloted by Benjamin Nicholls of Penzance and the Prince of Wales's (later Edward VII) yacht Britannia was piloted by Ben's brother Philip Nicholls. The Britannia won by just over 7 minutes. People came by train from all over the south west to watch this race. Both brothers were Trinity House pilots of Penzance. In sixteen races against Britannia, Vigilant was beaten twelve times. Vigilant raced in the defender trials for the 1895 America's Cup won by Defender. From 1896 to 1910 Vigilant had six different owners. Massachusetts socialite Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr. purchased the Vigilant in 1902. Her final owner was William Iselin who sailed her from 1906 until 1910. Vigilant was broken up at a New London junkyard in 1910.

The station primarily serves the Greater Danbury listening area. The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts from a tower located in Patterson, New York near the Putnam/Dutchess county line. WDBY also operates a booster, WDBY-FM1 in Brookfield, Connecticut, which broadcasts with 1.2 kilowatts. Though it is the only FM station in Putnam County, WDBY's primary target market is Danbury, Connecticut. Even though the hills in and around Danbury, Connecticut limits the main 105.5 signal, the Brookfield booster has the ability to cover the primary coverage area. WDBY also targets eastern Putnam County as well as southern Dutchess County, where it regularly rates in the Poughkeepsie market. Due to its tower height, WDBY's signal covers most of the Route 22/I-684 corridor. The WDBY studios are located on Federal Road in Brookfield, Connecticut. History Early days and Majic 105 The 105.5 frequency licensed to Patterson/Pawling first signed on as WRVH. The first license was granted on May 20, 1982. WRVH was a class A facility with 3,000 Watts of effective radiated power. Its studio was located on New York State Route 292 in Patterson, New York. WRVH was founded by retired IBM engineer Edward Valentine, who also served as the station‚Äôs General Manager. Valentine was able to find a ‚Äúgray area‚Äù at 105.5, at sufficient distance from WDHA in Morristown, New Jersey as to avoid short-spacing with that co-channel station. When Valentine ran short of funds to complete building the station, he partnered with Richard Novik, owner of WPUT (1510 AM) in Brewster, New York. Novik had always wanted an FM station to accompany WPUT, but was unable to find one until Valentine found the ‚Äúgray area‚Äù at 105.5; Novik filed a competing application for that frequency, but the CP was awarded to Valentine. When Valentine‚Äôs funding ran short, he partnered with Novik to put WRVH on the air. The station‚Äôs format was ‚ÄúBeautiful Music‚Äù‚Ä¶a compromise, as Valentine had wanted an all Classical format, and Novik wanted a Contemporary format. Valentine did manage to get SOME Classical music on the station: for an hour a day at 7:00 p.m. weeknights, called ‚ÄúTableside Concert‚Äù; as well as a couple of specialty shows on Sundays. The Beautiful Music format was not a great success, as WRVH (with its Class A signal) was up against 2 giants: WHUD in Peekskill, New York and WEZN in Bridgeport, Connecticut‚Ä¶both with Class B signals and both running Beautiful Music formats. The original staff consisted of Ron Wilson (from WPUT) in mornings; Jennifer Dudley in afternoons; Kenn Hayes (from WKTU and WTFM in New York City) at night; and Kevin O‚ÄôKeefe on overnights. Hayes also hosted the station‚Äôs Classical music on weeknights (‚ÄúTableside Concert‚Äù) and the Sunday Classical program ‚ÄúThe Sound of Things to Come‚Äù (featuring then-new CD technology); while also working at WPAT-FM (Beautiful Music) and WQXR-FM (Classical) in New York City. In the mid-1980s, Beautiful Music began to decline in ratings. Listeners were aging-out of the format; stations began adding more vocals. Valentine and Novik sold WRVH to Ron Graiff, who changed the format to Adult Contemporary, and the call letters to WMJV. The station became ‚ÄúMagic 105‚Äù on July 21, 1986. The call letters stood for Majic (MJ) and the Roman numeral for 5 (V). The station's new main competitor was then Contemporary-formatted WVIP-FM and later WHUD and WDAQ. In the early 1990s, Majic 105's on-air staff included Bob Stanhope, Dick Farrell and Gary Peters (mornings), PD/MD Al Matthews (middays), Flora Whitelaw, Langdon Towne and Cutler Whitman (afternoons), \\"Rich Andrews\\" aka talk show host Joe Thomas, Hank Tuttle and Jim Hartman (nights), John Harrison, Cutler Whitman and Langdon Towne (overnights) and weekenders Joe Rondini, JJ, Jed Taylor, Rob \\"Robbie\\" Adams and Rob Deldin. Putnam/Westchester simulcast and Super Station era In the early 1990s, Majic 105 began to have more competition as the rivals it had as WRVH also evolved to Adult Contemporary, in turn giving the station bigger signaled and heritage competition. In late September 1993 in order to more effectively compete with WHUD and WFAS-FM in Westchester and Putnam County and WDAQ in Danbury, Connecticut Majic 105's owner/manager Ron Graiff acted on impulse and purchased WVIP-FM/106.3 in Mount Kisco, New York from Martin Stone. WVIP-FM by then had encountered tough times, it was airing a gold-based AC format with some dayparts live and some satellite-fed. It had become a shell of its former self. The plan was to expand WMJV's reach via simulcast further south into Westchester County for a bigger and better area-wide signal. The stations could then be heard from Dover Plains to White Plains. On Friday night September 24 at 7:00 p.m. Alix Bragga did the last show on WVIP-FM. The last song played was \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" by Whitney Houston. The station then signed off at midnight and was moved overnight from Radio Circle in Mount Kisco, New York to the WMJV studios on RT-292 in West Patterson. On Saturday morning September 25 the plan turned into reality as WVIP-FM became WMJU (the calls meant nothing - it was alphabetically before WMJV and looked similar). The stations were then simulcast and branded as \\"NY's Super Station\\" super-serving both Putnam County and Westchester County. Weekender Jed Taylor did the first show at 6:00 a.m. The format was upgraded from AC to Hot AC and in time it became Putnam County's Arbitron rated #1 radio station. At its peak, Super Station had a music library of almost 1,300 songs that spanned the 1970s, 1980s up to the mid-1990s and was consistently rotated. All music decisions were made in-house and its positioning statement was \\"The Most Music and the Best Variety\\". It was very successful for its time although it lasted just two years. Super Station was locally programmed by multi-market PD (and former WVIP-AM-FM PD) Al Matthews (middays) with an air staff that included Gary Peters, Ray Graff and John Chipman (mornings), Cutler Whitman and Chris Cimmino (afternoons), APD/MD Jim Hartman (nights), Langdon Towne (overnights) and weekenders Jed Taylor, Alix Bragga, Colleen Brown, KC Kressu, Kyle Kelley, Steve Maiolo, Bobby West, Tim Court, Paul Hoch, Chris Todaro, Jim McCannon, Mike Cannavaro and Rob Deldin. The news department was headed by ND Janice Berliner (mornings), Jennifer Fogarty and Greg Messinger (afternoons). Morning and afternoon traffic reports were handled by Kyle Kelley and Steve Maiolo. The chief engineer was Ron Graiff, the owner, who had been handling these duties since purchasing the station in 1986. Weekend music programs included a local Top 30 Countdown on Friday nights, The Retro Show (dance classics) on Saturday nights and Casey's Hot 20 on Sunday nights. Super Station's jingle package was produced by Jam Creative Productions and the stations liners were voiced by John Driscoll. Sold stations, format changes and relocations On Monday October 2, 1995 Ron Graiff sold the stations (along with Country AM sister WPUT, 1510 AM) to Gary Starr, owner of WINE and WRKI in Brookfield, Connecticut. He dropped the \\"Super Station\\" brand, changed the call letters to WVYB/WVIB (to remind listeners of the old WVIP-FM) and flipped the format back to a gold-based AC branded as \\"B-105/B-106\\". In essence it reverted to what WVIP-FM was airing prior to it being sold in September 1993. That afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Chris Cimmino and then Chris Todaro did the last Super Station show. The last song played was \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" by Supertramp. at 7:00 p.m. Jim Hartman did the first B-105/B-106 show. The new format was put into place and the music library was then drastically cut. Lorna Potter took over as general/sales manager. PD Al Matthews left and Emily Anton took over middays. The I-95 PD's Lou Rizzo and then Tim Sheehan were the program directors (though they were still based at WRKI) and Alan Sneed (based in Atlanta, Georgia) was hired as a programming and music consultant. Then, in about four weeks time, the stations were sold again to Commodore Media Inc. (Commodore Media would later be sold to Capstar Broadcasting) and the two stations were then split up from its simulcast, format, call letters and location. The entire staff except for the morning show were let go. WVYB's new calls were WAXB (the B-105 brand was kept) with an oldies format via satellite from Westwood One except for its live morning show with John Chipman and Steve Maiolo. The station was moved to the WRKI studios in Brookfield, Connecticut and its Arbitron market was changed from Poughkeepsie, New York to Danbury, Connecticut. In October 2008 Cumulus Media sold the West Patterson, New York property and its new owners tore down the long unused studio building. It has now become a newly built residential location. WVIB's new calls were WZZN (The Zone-slogan though not used) with a short-lived jazz and then short-lived classic rock format also via satellite except for its live morning show with Emily Anton. Both formats were unsuccessful. The station was moved to the WFAS studios in Hartsdale, New York and eventually changed its calls to WFAF (sounds like WFAS) to become a northern simulcast of WFAS-FM and its AC format. On February 29, 2012 Cumulus dropped the WFAS/WFAF simulcast and started simulcasting country WDBY on it, in essence returning it to what it had been during its Super Station years albeit now with country. The calls were changed to WDVY (sounds like WDBY). In 2006, when its iron-clad 40-year lease was up, WFAF's tower was moved from atop Darlington Castle to the Fox Lane Campus in Bedford and since then, its signal is not as strong due to a decrease in both terrain and tower height. Due to economic conditions and signal issues, the 106.3 frequency has never been a stand-alone FM since its sale and split from WVIP back in late September 1993. It has been and still is a simulcasted signal-first with WMJV/WVYB, then WFAS, for a short time WPDH and then again WFAS and now WDBY. Cumulus eventually sold WDVY to Family Stations and on January 14, 2013, country was out and non-commercial religion was in. WPUT also flipped its satellite format from Country to Adult Standards and then to ESPN Sports. The daytime-only station was licensed to Brewster, New York before the station went off-air in 2014 & its license was deleted in 2015. From B-105 to Y-105 to Kicks 105.5 When Capstar Broadcasting was purchased by AM/FM Inc. (a subsidiary of what would become Clear Channel Communications) in 1999, the company was forced to divest its holdings in the northern suburbs of New York City due to Federal Communications Commission market concentration concerns. When Aurora Communications purchased those stations WAXB saw an increase in its budget that allowed the station to eliminate satellite fed programming. With this came a modified name, \\"B105.5\\", and modified oldies that leaned as recent as the early 80s. However, Aurora's ownership was to be short-lived as in 2000 a failed buyout by Nassau Broadcasting took place which was followed in 2001 by Aurora being bought out by Cumulus Media. After Cumulus took control of the Aurora stations in April 2002, control of the Danbury]cluster became separate from their Hudson Valley cluster. Though WAXB had good ratings in both Danbury, Connecticut and Dutchess County with oldies, listeners were aging out of the format and Cumulus management sensed a hole for a more contemporary competitor against market rival WDAQ. WAXB flipped to Adult Top 40 on September 26, 2002 as Y-105 after two days of stunting and taking the new WDBY calls (DanBurY) that October. (The WAXB calls returned to the market in 2011 on 850 AM in Ridgefield, a sister station to WDAQ.) It forced 98Q to move to a more Top 40 approach in both music and presentation. Y-105 later evolved from a Bright AC to a Hot AC. On January 12, 2009, Y-105 hired longtime 98Q morning host Mr. Morning to host its morning show. WDBY switched to its current country format on January 11, 2010. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus stations, including WDBY, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. HD radio Cumulus Broadcasting began upgrading its stations to HD Radio broadcasting in 2005. One of the first ten stations to be upgraded was WDBY.

Professor Cyril Toumanoff suggests 106‚Äì116 as the years of his reign, and considers him to be the son and successor of Mithridates I of Iberia who is known from epigraphic material as a Roman ally. Toumanoff also identifies him with the Amazaspus of the Stele of Vespasian and Xepharnuges of the Stele of Serapit. The Georgian chronicles report Amazasp‚Äôs joint ten-year rule with Derok (Deruk) and record Armazi as his seat (whereas Derok‚Äôs residence was at Mtskheta).

The Golf Club is situated in Heretaunga, Upper Hutt, just north of Wellington and alongside the Hutt River between Silverstream and Trentham.  History  The club was first established in 1895 at Miramar, until it experienced difficulties in renewing its lease in 1904. The Barton family of Trentham and Wairarapa owned extensive land in the Heretaunga area in the Upper Hutt Valley and offered to sell club 48.5 hectares of their estate. This offer was accepted in a Club meeting on 20 November 1906 and subsequently much of the land was cleared and marshes drained to construct the rudimentary course. Some club members donated trees and shrubs in these early years. By 1908 the club had completed its move to Heretaunga and an 18-hole course had been completed along with a tennis court, croquet and putting green. Its historic and elegant clubhouse was designed by architects Crichton and MacKay. The club was opened in a ceremony on 25 April 1908, by Joseph Ward, Prime Minister and president of the club.  Course  The course was expanded from 18 to 27 holes in 1972‚Äì73. The present championship course was redesigned by Greg Turner and Scott Macpherson and opened in 2013. There is also a nine-hole Terrace course, which takes in some of the most scenic parts of the club's property. Royal Wellington Golf Course is the host venue for the 2017 Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship.  Championships  Seven New Zealand Opens have been held at Heretaunga, the first in 1912, followed by 1932, 1954, 1976, 1981, 1987 and most recently in 1995, when Australian Lucas Parsons was the winner of the sixth and last open held at the club.

Professor Cyril Toumanoff suggests AD 116‚Äì132 as the years of Pharasmanes‚Äô reign. He features in several Classical accounts. Life The medieval Georgian annals report Pharasmanes' joint rule with Pharasmanes Avaz, diarchs (one source has the extra pair: Rok and Mihrdat), but several modern scholars consider the Iberian diarchy unlikely as it is not corroborated by the contemporary evidence. Pharasmanes is reported to have been the son of his predecessor, King Amazasp I. He is said to have married Ghadana, daughter of King Vologases III of Parthia who ruled in Armenia. According to the medieval Life of Kings, the traditional friendship of the two dyarchs soured at the instigation of the Iranian wife of Mihrdat. Toumanoff regards this information a back-projection of the historically recorded enmity of Pharasmanes I of Iberia and his brother Mithridates of Armenia.Toumanoff, Cyril. Chronology of the Early Kings of Iberia. Traditio 25 (1969), p. 17. The chronicle then continues a story of an Armenian-Roman alliance and their invasion of the Iranian-backed Iberia in which Pharasmanes finds his death.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, pp. 289-290. Peeters Publishers, . Reign Pharasmanes II is mentioned on the Stele of Serapit. The Georgian royal annals describe Pharasmanes in the following way: The contemporary Classical authors, with more solid historical background, focus on Pharasmanes‚Äô uneasy relations with Rome. He refused in 129 to come and pay homage to the emperor Hadrian. According to the Aelius Spartianus, one of the authors of Augustan History: Pharasmanes then went touring the East, and prompted the Alans to attack the neighboring Roman provinces by giving them a passage through his realm, even though the emperor had sent him greater gifts including a war elephant, than to any other king of the East. In his pique, Hadrian dressed some 300 criminals in the gold-embroidered cloaks which were part of the return gift of Pharasmanes, and sent them into the arena. According to Spartianus: Fragment of the Fasti Ostienses which mentions King Pharasmanes' visit to Rome. Eventually, the ancient sources report a highly honored visit paid by Pharasmanes to Hadrian‚Äôs successor Antoninus Pius. According to Cassius Dio, he came to Rome as guest of Antoninus Pius, together with his wife, son, and noble retinue where he was especially honored, being allowed to sacrifice in the Capitol and to have his equestrian statue in the temple of Bellona, and also the emperor increased the territory of his kingdom.Kavtaradze, Giorgi Leon (June 2000). \\"Caucasica II: The Georgian Chronicles and the Raison d'√àtre of the Iberian Kingdom\\", Orbis Terrarum: p. 218. This Pharasmanes, however, might have been Pharasmanes III, Pharasmanes II‚Äôs possible grandson. This visit was recorded on a fragment of the Fasti Ostienses.Vidman, Ladislav (1982) Fasti Ostienses: edendos, illustrandos, restituendos, curavit Ladislavs Vidman. p.124 According to the Georgian royal annals King Pharasmanes was poisoned by the chef sent by the Parthians.

Many train and bus operators in Europe have created phone apps in which tickets can be bought and stored. These include but are not limited to SJ, DSB, NSB, DB and selected local transit authorities.  History  The first mobile ticketing deployment for a public transport operator in the UK was for Chiltern Railways in 2007. The first transit agency in the US to deploy mobile ticketing was in 2012 with Boston's MBTA and the first agency in Australia was in 2017 with Adelaide Metro.

Mobile Tickets can be purchased via internet and will be downloaded in a few seconds to the mobile phone, be it in an sms with a 2-D barcode or to the connected NFC chip. In case of NFC at entrance the phone just has to be touched to the scanning device (in fact it makes contact within 10 cm). The GSM Association, GSMA, published a whitepaper on M-Ticketing in 2011. It describes extensively the use and advantages of M-Ticketing, principally the use of NFC technology. They state that NFC is the best technology but \\"it is expected however that M-Ticketing services using SMS and Bar Code implementations will be prevalent until the point that a critical mass of NFC enabled handsets is available.\\" Barcode and visual validation is still the accepted way to enable mobile ticketing with proven adoption thanks to the fact that tickets work across all smartphones.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,234. For hundreds of years the village was basically a hamlet and the two settlements remained separate despite Rugby's continued growth. However, in 2003-04 a new housing estate, Cawston Grange, was completed all but connecting the two settlements. Cawston Grange Primary School was built at the same time to educate children in the area aged 4‚Äì11 and there is a nursery for pre-school children, as well as a public house and shops. One of the most significant older buildings in the village is Cawston House. It was built in 1545 by Edward Boughton. The house has been in the hands of several notable titled families and was also used as a convalescent home for troops from Belgium in World War I, a girls' school between 1938 and 1958, and a research and development unit for an engineering company. The house was greatly altered in 1907 and remains the same externally to this day. In 2004 the house was bought by a developer and sub-divided to make a retirement village. The old Rugby to Leamington railway line ran through the old village (this closure predates the Beeching cuts, but part was still used as a freight line to Rugby Cement works at Long Itchington) and its path can still be walked along. The railway bridge over the A4071 has in recent years gained minor fame for the 'witty' slogans written on it.

It was the band's last recording with drummer Atom, who left the group shortly thereafter due to disagreements over the professional direction of the band. The EP was recorded by friend of the band Gar Wood in his garage. It has unusual packaging; the die cut cardboard sleeve has a large flower-shaped sticker placed over the center hole, making it necessary to cut the sticker around the center hole in order to remove the record from the sleeve. This causes the cut-out portion of the sticker to then become the center label of the record. The warning \\"cut carefully and play loud\\" is printed along the edge of the area to be cut, since cutting the sticker poses the risk of scratching the record. This warning became the de facto title of the EP. Because of the unusual packaging the records all had to be hand-assembled by the band and friends. The EP was released in 12\\" vinyl format limited to 3,000 copies, with the first 100 copies pressed on translucent blue vinyl. The original EP is out of print, however all the songs were re-released on CD format on the compilation album Hot Charity/Cut Carefully and Play Loud in 2002. In the insert notes of the CD re-release, singer/guitarist John Reis describes Cut Carefully and Play Loud as \\"a snapshot of a band in hell.\\" After the band ended their contract with major label Interscope Records they spent much of 1999 uncertain of their future or what their next move would be. They were not as prolific as they had been in past years, but still would rehearse and record roughly 3 times per week. Of the songs recorded during this period the band contributed what they felt were the best to the EP. It was due to this period of uncertainty as well as disagreements with Reis over the band's career decisions that drummer Atom left the group in early 2000.

She was named for Capella, the star. Built in Pennsylvania Capella was built in 1920 as Comerant by American International Shipbuilding Corporation, Hog Island, Pennsylvania, under a Shipping Board contract; acquired by the Navy 20 November 1921; and commissioned 8 December 1921, Lieutenant Commander S. W. Hickey, USNRF, in command. Relief supplies to Japan Capella arrived at San Diego, California, 19 March 1922 to carry cargo along the west coast until July, when she returned to the east coast for similar duty in the next 4 months. Back in California waters in November, Capella sailed to Japan in October 1923 to bring food and medical supplies, donated by American citizens, as well as water for the relief of earthquake- desolated Yokohama. Placed in reserve The cargo ship resumed west coast operations until February 1924 when she returned to Norfolk, Virginia. Capella was decommissioned and placed in reserve there 1 September 1924. She was recommissioned 10 November 1938, and resumed supply runs along the east and west coast in alternate periods, on occasion penetrating Alaskan waters. Pre-WWII and WWII service During July and August 1940 Capella assisted in the tow of the Navy's 10,700 ton New Orleans floating drydock from Balboa, Panama Canal Zone to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

The veteran cargo ship furrowed east coast waters, supporting bases from the Panama Canal Zone to Newfoundland with cargoes brought from Atlantic ports until 1944. In June she cleared on the first of four transatlantic convoy crossings to Scotland, and North and West Africa, all so safely guarded as to be made without incident. On 9 April 1942, Capella was hit by a friendly torpedo fired from PT-59, causing eight injuries, but no deaths. Post WWII and decommissioning Capella returned to Caribbean cargo duty in June 1945, and on 30 November 1945 was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia. She was transferred to the War Shipping Administration in July 1946.

The books were written by Julie Campbell Tatham, writing as Julie Campbell; she also wrote the original volumes of the Trixie Belden series (beginning in 1948) for Whitman.Julie Campbell The Ginny Gordon series is very similar to the Trixie Belden books‚Äîapparently Whitman wanted a second series to appeal to the same audience as the first. In many ways, the Ginny Gordon books can be seen as less-well developed versions of the Trixie Belden series, but the books still have a good bit of charm in their depictions of youth culture of post-World War II, but still pre-Baby Boom, young teenagers. Characters Similar to Trixie, Ginny is fourteen years old and lives in Westchester County, New York. While Trixie is a farm girl, living two miles outside the small town of Sleepside, Ginny lives in Harristown, a suburb of New York City, but one that is still a small town with surrounding farmland. Her father is the publisher of the local newspaper. The initial volumes of the Trixie Belden series provide a developing story arc (in the first book, Trixie Belden has no close friends, but meets new-girl-in-town Honey Wheeler, and they both meet Jim Frayne, a runaway; in the second book, Trixie and Honey trace Jim, who has run to upstate New York looking for a job at a boys' summer camp; in the third book, Trixie, Honey, and Jim are all safely at home‚ÄîHoney's parents have adopted Jim‚Äîwhen Trixie's brothers Brian and Mart come home from camp; the five young people decide to start a secret club). The Ginny Gordon, books, though, begin in medias res, beginning in the fall of the year after school has started. Ginny's best friend is Lucy Tryon, who, like Honey Wheeler, was a new girl in town, but her arrival took place before the first book opened. At some date before the opening of the series, Ginny, Lucy, and John Blaketon‚ÄîGinny's love interest‚Äîand his thirteen-year-old twin cousins Whiz and Babs Reilly formed a secret club, the Hustlers. Like Trixie, Ginny loves a mystery, although Lucy is a much more reluctant partner than Honey Wheeler. John Blaketon stands in for both Jim Frayne and Brian Belden, as the older (at fifteen), more mature, and cautious voice of reason, trying to keep Ginny out of trouble. Whiz Reilly is very similar to Mart Belden, mostly making fun of Ginny. List of titles # Ginny Gordon and the Mystery of the Disappearing Candlesticks (1948). The Hustlers start a swap shop as a money-making project, but have to deal with the disappearance of Ginny's Great-Aunt Betsy's heirloom silver candlesticks, and along the way tackle a jewel thief. # Ginny Gordon and the Missing Heirloom (1950). The Hustlers still have the swap shop, but now it is old Mrs. Arnold's pinCampbell, Julie, Ginny Gordon and the Missing Heirloom, (Racine: Whitman Publishing Company, 1950), 16. that is missing. Ginny finds that the plot is not just about a pin, but a scheming woman's plan to take over all of Mrs. Arnold's estate.Campbell, Julie, Ginny Gordon and the Missing Heirloom, (Racine: Whitman Publishing Company, 1950), 61-62. # Ginny Gordon and the Mystery of the Old Barn (1951). The Hustlers have sold the swap shop to Joe Dakor, and their new project is a snack barn as a hangout for young people. The plot here, dealing with two criminals who had a falling out, is similar to the third Trixie Belden book, The Gatehouse Mystery. Here, though, it is not a diamond, but cash money that is left behind. One sub-plot deals with the arrival of \\"Lochinvar,\\" a \\"hillbilly\\" (not yet rock and roll or country and western) singer who performs at the Harristown Inn (drawing the teen-aged crowd away from the Hustlers' snack barn). # Ginny Gordon and the Lending Library (1954). The Hustlers latest project is a subscription lending library. Mystery develops as someone keeps trying to steal a popular novel. # Ginny Gordon and the Broadcast Mystery (1956). There are several plots in this, but no real criminal activity. The Hustlers are having a used book sale at their lending library when a rare and valuable book of Mrs. Arnold's is mistakenly donated. When Mrs. Arnold attempts to recover the book, all the Hustlers are certain they did not sell it, but it cannot be found. Ginny tries to solve the mystery of the missing book, while other mysteries abound: the identity of a bitter young woman who moves to Harristown, all the pranks and confusion at the lending library. The whole time, Ginny is trying to organize a radio book-chat for teenagers that the local radio station asks her to do. A subplot deals with a popular novel, \\"My Heart's in the City,\\" that everyone is sure is a roman a clef based on their own Harristown. This is perhaps based on the real furor that followed the publication of Peyton Place, which many people in New England felt was based on a real town. Book formats The Missing Heirloom, The Disappearing Candlesticks, and The Mystery of the Old Barn were published in hardcover with dustjackets, illustrated by Margaret Jervis. Whitman changed formats for their juvenile line by the time The Lending Library and The Broadcast Mystery were published in the mid-1950s. Rather than having illustrated dustjackets over solid-color hardcovers, these two titles have wrap-around, full-color, illustrated covers, covered in cellophane. The first three titles were also reprinted in this format with new cover art.

It is present and used in the Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME products. It is not present in the Windows NT family of operating systems, such as Windows XP. There are three variants of the file: * LOGO.SYS: is the \\"Starting Windows\\" message, with the Windows logo. The file is located in the root directory of the boot drive. This is usually , but with drive compression, like DriveSpace, this is the host drive (often ). The default LOGO.SYS file is also stored in IO.SYS and used by MS-DOS during startup if LOGO.SYS could not be found. The display of the logo can be disabled by adding a \`LOGO=0\` setting to the \`Options\` section in the MS-DOS 7 configuration file MSDOS.SYS. * LOGOW.SYS: is the \\"Please wait while Windows is shutting down\\" message. The file is located in the Windows directory, which by default is . The Windows logo is shown only in Windows 95 and 98. No error will be shown if the file cannot be found. The shutdown screen (LOGOW.SYS) of English Windows 98 version 4.10.2222 * LOGOS.SYS: is the \\"It is now safe to turn off your computer\\" message. The file is located in the Windows directory. This message is displayed when Windows has successfully shut down to MS-DOS but is not configured to return to the prompt (COMMAND.COM) again. On systems with proper ACPI support and ATX power supply, the PC may power down instead. If the file cannot be found, the same message is displayed in text mode. No error will be shown if the file cannot be found. LOGO.SYS is in fact an 8-bit RLE-encoded Windows bitmap file with a resolution of exactly 320√ó400 pixels at 256 colors. This is displayed in the otherwise little-used 320x400 VGA graphics mode, a compromise to allow the display of a 256-color image with high vertical (but not horizontal) resolution on all compatible systems, even those with plain VGA cards (which could only show 16 colors with high horizontal resolution) and without needing any additional graphics drivers. The mode appears, to any attached monitor, to be identical to the more common 640x400 graphics or 720x400 text modes, and is therefore stretched to a standard 4:3 aspect ratio (meaning the pixels appear to be 1.67x (2/1.2) wider than they are tall, instead of square - as they would be on a full 640x480 VGA display) on a typical 4:3 monitor of the time, and on monitors of other shapes (5:4, 16:9, etc.) when set to display standard video modes in their original aspects with letterbox borders. This lent the startup screens a peculiar, characteristic \\"feel\\" and made them more suited to certain subjects (which disguised the horizontal blockiness or made good use of the vertical resolution) than others (which accentuated it), meaning some skill was needed in choosing an image that would still be aesthetically pleasing - or even clear enough to be properly interpreted - once resized. For LOGO.SYS or the equivalent embedded image in IO.SYS, Windows will also animate the image's color information using palette rotation; the image is static, but may have the illusion of movement as colors are changed. As the files are standard RLE-compressed .BMPs (with an entirely optional custom tag segment) renamed to \\".SYS\\", they may be opened and edited using image editing tools such as MS Paint, and the contents replaced with user-selected pictures; the only conversion needed is to change the file extension, and to ensure they are in the correct resolution and color depth (with dithering if needed). However, the process is not foolproof: * Ensuring the aspect ratio is correct can be confusing, as it is usually displayed in a horizontally compressed form on a screen with square pixels (the most reliable method being to edit at full size, crop to 4:3, then resize to 320x400) * The loading indicator animation was created using palette rotation. The number of palette entries to rotate is determined by the otherwise seldom used \`biClrImportant\` field of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure. Image editing software usually discarded this data, so it was often not possible to retain it. Some logo creation utilities were specifically created to restore the cycling function and allow creating custom animations. * Just like the bootsplash screens in earlier versions of Windows, there was a hard but poorly documented limit on how large the compressed file could be, because of the very limited memory available during the boot process (the very reason that RLE was used in the first place - a plain BMP would have been 125kb and thus entirely too large; the default images are around 10 to 70kb each). If the file was too large, it would either simply fail to display or cause the system to crash, which required the user to reboot and drop into DOS mode before the logo had a chance to load, and either delete it or rename it to prevent the system trying to display it again before it could be fixed or replaced. Staying below, and moreover editing an image to bring it below this limit was an imprecise science that mostly required taking advantage of the particular characteristics of RLE, e.g. ensuring there were sufficient areas of the screen with long horizontal runs of the same color, by reducing the dither quality or color reduction mode, shrinking it slightly and adding a black border a few pixels wide all around, etc. Each run allowed a two byte code to represent a strip many pixels wide, and hence blank spaces or areas of flat color compressed very tightly, whereas regions with no repeated colors at all were at best uncompressed, at worst slightly larger than they would otherwise have been.

He grew up in a noble family from the Diocese of Chernigov. In 1706, he became a monk at the Lavra of the Kiev Caves. Afterwards he was appointed a professor at the Ecclesiastical Academy of Moscow, and then the locum tenens chaplain-general at the Lavra of St. Alexander Nevsky in St. Petersburg. In 1721 he was consecrated bishop of Pereyaslavl in preparation for his leadership of the Orthodox mission to China. As a bishop he was not permitted entry to China and was therefore appointed to the see of Irkutsk in 1727. While in Irkutsk, he learned Mongolian and preached to the local people, converting many of them. He died in 1731 and was buried beneath the altar of the Tikhvin church of Ascension Monastery. During restoration work on the church in 1764, Innocent's relics were found to be incorrupt. After numerous miracles attributed to his intercession, he was glorified a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1804. Since the actual date of his repose coincides with the commemoration of the icon of the Theotokos \\"Of the Sign\\" of Novgorod, his feast day was moved to the day prior. In 1921 the Soviet government confiscated his relics and placed them on display in various museums as a \\"Siberian mummy\\". The relics were returned to the Church on September 7, 1990. This saint is occasionally confused with the later Innocent of Alaska who was named in his honor. Because of his appointment as head of the Orthodox mission in China St. Innocent is regarded as the patron saint of China by many Chinese Orthodox today.

In later years when a full name was required for his passport Criswell supplied his father's first and middle names. Criswell grew up in Texline in Dallam County, the most northwesterly community in the Texas Panhandle, where his cowboy-barber father moved the family in 1915.Criswell, W. A. Why I Preach That the Bible Is Literally True. Nashville: B&H;, 1969. At age ten, young W. A. professed faith in Christ at a revival meeting led by the evangelist Reverend John Hicks. Two years later Criswell publicly committed his life to the gospel ministry. Criswell was licensed to preach at the age of seventeen and soon thereafter held part-time pastorates at Devil's Bend and Pulltight, Texas. While attending Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1928 to 1931 he ministered in Marlow, White Mound, and Pecan Grove, the latter in Fort Bend County, Texas. During his graduate and post-graduate years, including a Ph.D. at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, Criswell was the pastor of Baptist churches in Mount Washington in Bullitt County near Louisville and Oakland in Warren County near Bowling Green, Kentucky. After completing his degrees, Criswell in 1937 accepted the pastorate of the First Baptist Church of Chickasha in Grady County in central Oklahoma. In 1941, he moved to First Baptist Church of Muskogee in eastern Oklahoma. In 1935, Criswell married the former Bessie Marie \\"Betty\\" Harris (1913-2006), the pianist of the Mount Washington church and an education graduate of Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green. Their daughter Mabel Ann was born in Chickasha in 1939. Mabel Ann possessed an exceptional operatic voice and recorded three albums of sacred music in the late 1960s and early 1970s, two with the Ralph Carmichael orchestra. She died in 2002, some six months after her father's passing. First Baptist Church of Dallas 250px|left|thumb|For over fifty years Criswell was the pastor of the downtown First Baptist Church of Dallas, Texas, known for its Bible based teaching. In 1944 Criswell was called to replace George Washington Truett as the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas. He would spend the remainder of his life at First Baptist, preaching more than four thousand sermons from its pulpit. During his tenure membership grew from 7,800 to 26,000, with weekly Sunday School attendance in excess of 5,000. The church expanded to multiple buildings covering five blocks in downtown Dallas, eventually becoming the largest Southern Baptist church in the world. The popular evangelist Billy Graham joined the church in 1953, became a close friend of the Criswell family, and remained a member of the Dallas congregation for 55 years. Criswell was an early pioneer of the modern megachurch phenomenon and introduced a number of innovations at First Baptist Dallas that became a model for growing churches all over the country. By the early 1950s he had hired professionally trained educational directors for each age group of the church, organized a sophisticated multi-level Sunday School program, added a full-time business manager to the staff, and broadened the church into a youth and family life center featuring a bowling alley, skating rink, and gymnasium with a track and basketball court. He greatly expanded the church's long-standing Silent Friends ministry, creating for the deaf their own Sunday School, Training Union, Vacation Bible School, and summer camp ministries. His vigorous outreach efforts to the community included sponsoring thirty-seven inner city missions, a crisis pregnancy center, the Good Shepherd and Dallas Life Foundation ministries for the homeless and disadvantaged, Spanish-language chapels, and extensive television and radio ministries. Church services were locally televised as early as January 1951 and eventually were carried on stations nationwide.McBeth, Leon The First Baptist Church of Dallas: Centennial History (1868-1968), Zondervan, 1968, pp 240-347. Statue of Criswell at Criswell College. Criswell's accomplishments include helping to engineer the conservative resurgence of the Southern Baptist convention, a transition which began in the late 1970s. He was awarded eight honorary doctorates in addition to his earned postgraduate degree. He published fifty-four books, including an annotated Criswell Study Bible (in later editions the Believers Study Bible and Holy Bible, Baptist Study Edition, Thomas Nelson Publishers), and founded both Criswell College with its radio station KCBI, and First Baptist Academy. At Criswell's request in 1988 a search committee was formed to identify and call a new pastor. On Thanksgiving Sunday evening 1990 First Baptist called Joel C. Gregory as pastor, following the unanimous recommendation of the pastor search committee and the deacons. Gregory became pastor while Criswell took the title \\"Senior Pastor.\\" At the Wednesday evening service on September 30, 1992, Gregory announced his resignation, indicating that the intended succession of Criswell had not taken place. Gregory subsequently wrote Too Great a Temptation (Summit Group, 1994) describing his experiences during this period. In 1993 First Baptist called O. S. Hawkins as pastor and Criswell entered semi-retirement as pastor emeritus. He continued to preach at conferences, First Baptist's annual pre-Easter series, Sunday school and college lectures, and occasional Sunday morning messages for the remainder of the decade. Death Criswell died quietly at the home of longtime friend Jack Pogue on January 10, 2002, at the age of 92. His death made national headlines, and as a farewell honor the city of Dallas closed off the U.S.-75 North Central Expressway for the celebrated pastor's funeral cortege. Influence Well-known pastor and author Rick Warren recounts his call to full-time ministry as a 19-year-old student at California Baptist College, when in November 1973 he and a friend skipped classes and drove 350 miles to hear Criswell preach at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco. Warren stood in line to shake hands with Criswell afterwards. Warren went on to found the Saddleback Church in California, one of the most recognized ecumenical churches in the country, with weekly attendance in excess of 20,000. In his book, The Purpose Driven Church, Warren referred to Criswell as the \\"greatest American pastor of the twentieth century.\\" Audio recordings of Criswell's preaching began in December 1953, and over 4000 of his expository sermons are available free of charge in audio, video, and searchable transcript form at the W. A. Criswell Sermon Library website, one of the largest online collections by a single pastor in the world. It is sponsored and maintained by the non-profit W. A. Criswell Foundation which also supports Criswell College. Southern Baptist Convention presidency Dr. Criswell served two times as president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest non-Roman Catholic denomination in the United States, with some 16 million members. During the twenty years that followed he was perhaps the most popular preacher at evangelism and pastors' conferences in America, and also preached extensively in mission fields worldwide. Theology Criswell's theology is best described as conservative and evangelical. He believed in Biblical inerrancy, the eternal security of the believer, and Jesus Christ as the authority of spiritual truth and the sole path to salvation of sinful mankind. Unlike his predecessor George W. Truett, Criswell preached dispensational premillennialism and the pretribulation rapture of the church. Politics Segregation While he never spoke in support of racial segregation in his sermons and was not opposed to integration in principle, Criswell was at first critical of the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education and of federal intervention against de jure southern segregation. In 1956 he made an address denouncing forced integration to a South Carolina evangelism conference, and a day later to the South Carolina legislature. Taken aback by negative reactions to his remarks in the press, Criswell did not publicly address the issue again for over a decade, claiming he was \\"a pastor, not a politician.\\" However, upon his 1968 election as president of the Southern Baptist Convention and the SBC's endorsement of racial equality and desegregation, Criswell announced to the press, \\"Every Southern Baptist in the land should support the spirit of that statement. We Southern Baptists have definitely turned away from racism, from segregation, from anything and everything that speaks of a separation of people in the body of Christ.\\" Criswell's first sermon after his election as SBC president in 1968 was titled \\"The Church of the Open Door,\\" emphasizing that his church already had many non-white members and was open to all regardless of race. He asserted publicly, \\"I don't think that segregation could have been or was at any time intelligently, seriously supported by the Bible. Presidential elections In 1960 Criswell published an article attacking the appropriateness of Roman Catholics to serve as president, titled \\"Religious Freedom, the Church, the State, and Senator Kennedy.\\" The address, the text of which is available from the Kennedy Library archives, stoked the concern of some Protestants preceding the presidential election, to which Senator Kennedy responded in a speech on religious freedom and the separation of church and state. In 1976, Criswell supported the election of the Republican U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., an Episcopalian, rather than the Southern Baptist Democratic nominee, former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. Abortion Questioned in 1973 about the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade Criswell replied, \\"I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person, and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.\\" Criswell later became a staunch opponent of the procedure.

He was probably born in Glasgow, the child of the violinist Duncan McGibbon and his wife Sarah Muir, although earlier sources say he was born in Edinburgh. He may have studied in London under William Corbett, and may have travelled in Italy in his youth, possibly with Corbett. He seems to have settled in Edinburgh in the 1720s. He died in 1756, and left his estate to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Career He was the principal violinist of the Edinburgh Musical Society orchestra from 1726 until his death. Although a prolific composer, particularly for the flute, recorder and fiddle, only a few of his works are now known. Grove says they \\"vary in quality\\"; his early work shows influences of Corelli, Handel, Veracini, and Purcell, while after 1740 he produced many settings of Scottish tunes, which were then very popular, but still show an Italian influence.

He was a Labour Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1994 to 1999 and was elevated to the peerage in 2004. He has written on Russia, defence and energy, and works with a variety of companies in the field of non- renewable resource extraction. Previously somewhat low-profile in British politics, Truscott made headlines in 2009 as one of four Labour peers named by the Sunday Times as being willing to accept money to help companies amend bills that would have an adverse effect on them. He consequently became one of the first peers suspended from the House of Lords since the 17th century. Personal life Truscott was born in Newton Abbot, Devon and educated at Exeter College, University of Oxford. He received a BA in modern history in 1981, followed by a DPhil in 1985. In 1991, he met and rapidly married Svetlana Chernikov, daughter of a Red Army colonel. By 2008, the couple owned a ¬£1 million apartment in Mayfair, a flat in Bath and property in Russia. In February 2009, it was revealed that Truscott was, in line with House of Lords rules, classifying his small Bath flat as his main residence, thus entitling him to claim a ¬£28,000 per year public subsidy of his ¬£700,000 Mayfair flat. Political career Political organiser and MEP After completion of his doctorate, Truscott was a political organiser for the Labour Party from 1986 to 1989, and a councillor in Colchester from 1988 to 1992. He contested Torbay for the Labour Party in 1992, coming third with 5,503 votes (9.59%). He then went on to represent Hertfordshire in the European Parliament from 1994 to 1999. He was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Security Sub- Committee, and the delegation for relations with the Russian Federation throughout his time in the European Parliament, and was also the UK Government's spokesperson on foreign affairs and defence in the Parliament from 1997 to 1999. Peerage Having failed to win re-election to the European Parliament, Truscott was created a life peer on 10 June 2004 as Baron Truscott, of St. James's in the City of Westminster. From 2006 to 2007 he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the DTI government spokesperson in the House of Lords. Truscott is currently Parliamentary British Council Ambassador to the Russian Federation and republics of the former Soviet Union. He is a member of the House of Lords European Union Select Committee, Sub Committee C (Foreign Affairs, Defence and Development Policy). He was formerly a visiting research fellow with the Institute for Public Policy Research and an associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. In 2007 Truscott made a speech to a coal industry conference in his capacity as a DTI minister restating the government's strong support for the continued use of coal in electricity generation, a controversial policy opposed by scientists and campaigners such as climatologist James E. Hansen. While in the House of Lords, Truscott was judged by the Public Whip to have voted \\"very strongly against\\" efforts to strengthen the Climate Change Act 2008, opposing all of the following: the target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, the aim to prevent warming of more than 2 ¬∞C (the figure most commonly cited in discussions about avoiding runaway climate change), making the UK's annual statement on emissions the responsibility of the Prime Minister, and reporting on the international impact of the UK's emissions. He has also voted \\"strongly for\\" the Identity Cards Act 2006. In 2016 he came out in favour of Britain leaving the European Union. Involvement with energy and mining firms Truscott became a consultant and non-executive director working mainly with non-renewable resource extraction and public affairs companies throughout Europe and Russia. He developed a client list including Eastern Petroleum Corporation, controlled by the controversial Frank Timi≈ü and another Timi≈ü outfit: African Minerals, Gavin Anderson and Company, Opus Executive Partners, Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd, African Minerals Ltd, Landis & Gyr and his own consultancy firm, Energy Enterprises Ltd. Together with his wife, he bought 1,000,000 shares in Gulf Keystone Petroleum, which they bought in September 2008 at 20.75p per share, selling half of these in April 2010 for 85.22 pence per share. He additionally owns shares above the ¬£50,000 registration minimum in African Minerals Ltd. Corruption allegations In January 2009 Truscott was the subject of corruption allegations in the Sunday Times, along with three of his Labour colleagues. He was accused of seeking a ¬£72,000 fee to help two people posing as lobbyists \\"amend a government bill that was harmful to their client\\", saying he would have to \\"be a ‚Äòbit careful‚Äô and could not table the amendment himself.\\" He also claimed to have \\"done similar work before\\" on a recent piece of energy legislation, and met officials from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform shortly before the Government changed its policy in a manner favourable to his client, Landis & Gyr. His response to the BBC was: \\"to suggest I would offer to put down amendments for money is a lie\\". It was subsequently alleged that he had lobbied UK energy Minister Malcolm Wicks without declaring his financial interests. Following the publication of the allegations, and video and audio tape of Truscott talking to under-cover Sunday Times reporters, he was forced to resign a consultancy for Landis & Gyr and was suspended from his consultancy for Gavin Anderson and Company. He resigned his directorship of African Minerals in August 2009, retaining a remunerated role as a strategic consultant. Both Opus Executive Partners and Gulf Keystone decided not to suspend or remove Truscott despite considerable pressure from the media to do so, both citing valuable contribution and integrity in his involvement with them. The Lords Privileges Committee subsequently recommended (on 14 May) that Lord Truscott be suspended from the House. The investigation into the allegations concluded Lord Truscott had broken rules on exercising parliamentary influence in return for money by agreeing to \\"smooth the way\\" for lobbyists, make introductions to other peers and ministers and to lobby officials. In a BBC interview on 14 May, Lord Truscott stated that \\"I apologise for being entrapped and for using loose language\\". On 20 May the House of Lords considered the Privileges Committee report and voted to suspend Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor of Blackburn for six months, the first such action since the 17th century. In May 2009, it was alleged that the small flat in Bath that Lord Truscott calls his main residence was unoccupied and looked deserted. Classifying this flat as his main residence had entitled him to claim an annual ¬£28,000 per year public subsidy of his ¬£700,000 Mayfair flat, amounting to ¬£125,000 over four years. He resigned from the Labour Party in May 2009, and now sits as a non-affiliated member of the House of Lords.

The company's headquarters is in Cedar City, Utah adjacent to the Cedar City Regional Airport with additional engineering offices and manufacturing, service, repair and fatigue test facilities near and on the San Antonio International Airport in San Antonio, Texas. Founded as Swearingen Aircraft in 1959, the company was renamed the Sino Swearingen Aircraft Company in 1995 before being purchased in August 2008 by Emirates Investment and Development Corporation and renamed the Emivest Aerospace Corporation.\\"Sino Swearingen renamed Emivest Aerospace.\\" San Antonio Business Journal. In April 2011 the assets of Emivest Aerospace were purchased by MT, LC of Cedar City, Utah, and the company began doing business as SyberJet Aircraft. History An Excalibur 800 on display in an aircraft museum in the USA SA226-T Merlin III A Metro 23 at Sydney International Airport Swearingen Aircraft Swearingen Aircraft was founded by Ed Swearingen in 1959.Ed Swearingen biographical page on Sino Swearingen company website retrieved 31 August 2007 Early work by the company included the development of prototype aircraft for other manufacturers; such as the Twin Comanche prototype developed for Piper Aircraft during 1962 and the development of several research helicopters for the Bell Helicopter Company, work which led to the HueyCobra. The company also developed modifications of other designs, an activity Ed Swearingen had been involved in prior to his forming Swearingen Aircraft. These modification programs included the Excalibur 800 conversion of the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, (because the combined output of its two Lycoming IO-720 engines was 800 horsepower); airframe improvements included modifying the cabin to allow entry via an airstair instead of over the RH wing to a door, and landing gear doors that fully enclosed the wheels when retracted. The airstair was factory-fitted by Beechcraft during manufacture of the ultimate J50 model of the Twin Bonanza. The Queen Air development of the Twin Bonanza also received the Swearingen treatment, the Queen Air Excalibur having less extensive modifications, also involving fitting of IO-720s, replacing the more troublesome and lower-power geared Lycoming engines installed at manufacture, and the enclosed landing gear doors (the Queen Air was designed from the outset with an airstair). The United States Army had several of its U-8 versions of the Queen Air modified to this standard.Images on airliners.net website of US Army U-8F Seminoles 62-3836, 62-3838, 62-3861 and 62-3872 with Excalibur modifications visible; cross referenced with the 1962 USAF and US Army aircraft database to provide military identities where required. Information from both sites retrieved 31 August 2007. Excalibur aircraft are easily distinguishable from standard Twin Bonanzas and Queen Airs by the landing gear doors and the more rectangular engine cowlings of the Excaliburs compared to the rounded cowlings of the originals. The Excaliburs led to the first Swearingen design, the SA26 Merlin, which could be described as a pressurized Excalibur. The Merlin had modified Queen Air wings with redesigned fuel tanks, Queen Air horizontal tails, and Twin Bonanza landing gear. The Merlin's fuselage and vertical fin represented Swearingen's contribution to the overall design. The next step was turbine power, through the SA26-T Merlin IIA with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6s and the follow-on SA26-AT Merlin IIB with Garrett TPE331 turboprops. Next came the all-new SA226-T Merlin III with new wings, landing gear and cruciform horizontal tail mated to a slightly stretched version of the fuselage used on the Merlin II series. The design effort reached its logical conclusion with the Metro series of 19-seat airline aircraft, the first of which had its first flight on August 26, 1969. By this time the company was in financial difficulties and lacked the resources to proceed further, so the Metro did not enter production until Swearingen Aircraft was taken over by Fairchild in 1972. The company was then renamed the Swearingen Aviation Corporation with Ed Swearingen a 10% shareholder and chairman of the board of directors.Ed Swearingen biographical information contained in an online copy of a Memo to the Governor of the State of Oregon dated 21 August 1987; retrieved 31 August 2007. A total of 1,053 Merlins and Metros were produced when production ended in 1998; 350 short-fuselage Merlins and 703 long-fuselage Merlins and Metros.\\"Final Metro Delivery.\\" Airways magazine Vol. 8, No. 4; Issue 64, June 2001, p. 32. Airways International Inc. ISSN 1074-4320. The production figures for short-fuselage Merlins are derived from subtracting the long-fuselage production total of 703 obtained from the Wikipedia Metro article from the overall production total of 1,053 obtained from the magazine article. In 1971 Piper Aircraft entered into merger negotiations with Swearingen, but did not finalize the merger. In 1973 Ed Swearingen formed a new company and went back to modifying aircraft, developing a new version of the Lockheed Jetstar on behalf of the manufacturer and Garrett. The modifications entailed installing new Garrett TFE731 engines and aerodynamic improvements to the airframe, increasing the Jetstar's range from to with no increase in fuel capacity. The company then manufactured jet engine nacelles and other aircraft components as a subcontractor to various manufacturers including Cessna, Gates Learjet and Dassault. On May 1, 1982 Ed Swearingen resigned from Fairchild and exercised his right to reacquire the Swearingen business name. Fairchild changed the name of Swearingen Aviation to Fairchild Aircraft Corporation and Ed Swearingen's company then became the Swearingen Aircraft Corporation. Sino Swearingen The company devoted its energies to developing a new small jet for the general aviation market, which was eventually developed into the SJ30-2. The company was renamed Sino Swearingen in 1995 and it was converted into a limited company from a partnership on November 5, 1999. Financial backers of the company included the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan. The company was privately held, and sales for 2005 were reported at US$25.3 million. SSAC had spent over 12 years and over US$700 million in total investment by 2008, when investors from Dubai were introduced to Sino Swearingen by Action Aviation, Sino Swearingen‚Äôs largest distributor. The Dubai-based company became the majority shareholder in Sino Swearingen, with the Taiwanese government and private investors such as Action Aviation taking minority stakes. The acquisition by the Dubai investors followed the withdrawal from the sale in 2007 of SSAC's former investor, ACQ Capital, which was unable to proceed due to its exposure to the US sub-prime market. A 17 September 2008 press release stated that the Dubai investors would provide additional funding of up to $1 billion to help it design and develop its second aircraft model.Emivest to pump $1b into SSAC Gulfnews.com financial article retrieved 20 September 2008.

In 1996 Sino Swearingen petitioned to certify as a Commuter Category aircraft arguing that it was as safe, or safer than the current Part 23 Commuter Category aircraft. At the time only the Fairchild Metro 23 and the Beechcraft 1900D had been certified under these rules. Approval of this request allowed the SJ30 program to exceed the 12,500 lbs takeoff weight limit of Part 23 and paved the way for other companies to follow the SJ30 lead. The SJ30 program was the first jet aircraft company in over 30 years (since Learjet in 1963) to develop, certify, and manufacture a brand new jet aircraft. With all of it trials and tribulations, the SJ30 program showed why it is so difficult to build a company and develop and certify an aircraft at the same time, thus demonstrating why no one else had done it since Learjet. The SJ30 program was the first to fly both the Williams FJ44-1 and FJ44-2A engine and was instrumental in developing the engines with Williams International. Subsequent incorporation of the engines at Cessna and Raytheon led to their CitationJet and Premier aircraft, respectively. In keeping with Ed Swearingen‚Äôs vision of a better light jet, the SJ30 was the first aircraft designed around a 12 psi cabin for more comfort in the cabin. The 12 psi cabin results in a sea level cabin through 41,000 ft and less than a 1,800 ft cabin at its ceiling of 49,000 ft. The 12 psi cabin was first demonstrated in flight by company pilots on August 23, 2004. The original SJ30-1 prototype was on display at the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston, Texas when it was flooded by Hurricane Ike. As proof of its speed and range capability the SJ30 holds the following world‚Äôs records through the FAI/NAA: Recognized Speed Over a Closed Course ‚Äì San Antonio, Texas to Goose Bay, Canada, Recognized Speed Over a Closed Course - San Antonio, Texas to London, England, Recognized Speed Over a Closed Course - London, England to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In 2006, the National Aeronautic Association awarded Sino Swearingen Aircraft Corporation's SJ30 the FAI Honorary Group Diploma. Emivest Sino Swearingen was acquired by investors from Dubai in 2008. The Dubai-based company became the majority shareholder in Sino Swearingen, with the Taiwanese government and private investors taking minority stakes. The company name was changed to the Emivest Aerospace Corporation. On October 26, 2010, Emivest filed for bankruptcy after being unable to find further funds to continue operations. On April 7, 2011, a judge approved sale of Emivest assets to MT, LLC of Utah, an ownership group affiliated with Metalcraft Technologies, Inc. of Cedar City, Utah, a parts supplier for the SJ30. According to a news article, Emivest vice president Mark Fairchild stated that according to his understanding, MT, LC planned to maintain Emivest as a jet manufacturer, though he didn't know any details. SybertJet On June 15, 2011, MT, LC, the Cedar City, Utah-based company that purchased the assets of Emivest out of bankruptcy announced that the new company name would be SyberJet Aircraft. SyberJet owns the SJ30 type certificate. During and in support of the NBAA show SyberJet signed a contract with Honeywell for the development and purchase of its APEX (now Epic 2.0) avionics platform to be branded as SyberVisionR for the SJ30. In addition, SyberJet's factory Part 145 service center is appointed as a Williams International service station. Honeywell was chosen for several reasons, but the ability to get to market the quickest as well as their more attractive financial model pushed the decision in their favor. In June 2013 SyberJet announced a family of companies under the MSC Aerospace brand. MSC Aerospace is a family of integrated and synergistic companies with aerospace related operations. SyberJet Aircraft is the manufacturer of the world‚Äôs fastest light jet, the SJ30. SyberJet assemblies major assemblies, installs components, and systems, complete final assembly and production ground and flight tests in Cedar City, Utah as well as offices that include executive, finance, procurement, completions, and sales/marketing offices. The Texas location provides engineering, flight test operations, and flight training, as well as the location for the central repair station for support of the SJ30 customer fleet. Cedar City also has a satellite repair station location to support the West Coast customer fleet. Metalcraft Technologies, Inc (MTI) is another one of the MSC Aerospace companies which supports the fabrication and assembly of detail aircraft parts and aero-structures for leading aircraft manufacturers. In fact, MTI produced approximately 70% of the sheet metal parts and assembled the aft fuselage on the SJ30 since 1997. Other customers include Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Gulfstream, Middle River, Piper Aircraft, and Cessna Aircraft.CBI Associates is the third member of the MSC Aerospace family and is real estate development and management arm of MSC. SyberJet announced a final assembly location during press ceremonies in Cedar City, Utah. The Utah Governor‚Äôs Office of Economic Development Board of Directors and elected officials from Iron County and Cedar City have approved financial incentives for MSC Aerospace and its subsidiaries SyberJet Aircraft and Metalcraft Technologies (MTI) totaling almost $45 million. MTI and SJA will use these incentives to expand their manufacturing facilities in Cedar City, Utah in support of the production of the SJ30 business jet.

It was designed by Giovanni Pietro Morandi, given to the Minim Friars, and became the national church of the Calabrians. The monastery was refurbished under Father Francesco Zavaroni di Montalto, General of the order, and using as an architect Luigi Berettoni.Accurata, E Succinta Descrizione Topografica, E Istorica Di Roma, Volume 1, by Ridolfino Venturini, published by Carlo Barbellieni, Rome (1768); page 40. The late Baroque high altar was made by Giovanni Antonio de Rossi c. 1655 (who is also credited with the church's wooden tabernacle, set into a sculptured entrance of a military pavilion).The pavilion is a reference to the original meaning of tabernacle, a tent. It also refers to God's presence among the Jews when they carried the Ark of the Covenant with them and kept it in a tent-temple: God is present in this tabernacle as He was with the Jews. No new bell tower was built for the church - instead the 12th century Torre dei Margani was used, preserving its medieval coat-of-arms on the tower has been preserved. However, the church as a whole was not consecrated until 10 July 1728, by Pope Benedict XIII. The lower part of the fa√ßade was refinished in plaster in the 18th century, and the whole church was then restored in 1826 by Pope Leo XII. The present titular cardinal-deacon of the church, since 21 October 2003, is Renato Martino. Chapels The church contains an icon of Francis said to be a copy of a portrait, along with scenes from the life and miracles of the saint which can be seen in the sacristy and examples by Giuseppe Chiari in the second chapel on the south side. The ceiling of the sacristy was painted by Sassoferrato, with a motif of \\"The Blessed Virgin appearing to St Francis of Paola\\". On the side wall is the Crucifixion and St Francis of Paola by Francesco Cozza. By the door to the presbytery are the tombs of Lazzaro Pallavicini and Giovanni Pizzullo, both with busts by Agostino Corsini. *South side chapels (right as you enter) #1st: Altarpiece of Saint Anne, Joachim and the Madonna by Filippo Luzi and ceiling frescoes by Onofrio Avellino. #2nd: Altarpiece of St Francis of Assisi #3rd: Altarpiece of Sts Francis of Paola and Francis of Sales, patrons of the Order, painted by Antonio Crecolini.

The ferry route forms part of the B5285 road and crosses the lake at about its midpoint, from Ferry Nab in Bowness-on- Windermere to Ferry House at Far Sawrey, a distance of some . The ferry is owned and operated by Cumbria County Council. The ferry operates all year, with services every 20 minutes from early morning to mid-evening. Each crossing can carry up to 18 cars and over 100 passengers and takes less than 10 minutes. A toll is charged. If the ferry is not operating, the alternative is a road journey of approximately around either the head or foot of the lake. History A steam ferry on the route in the late 19th century There has been a ferry at the site of the current Windermere Ferry for more than 500 years, with the earliest craft being rowed across the lake. During this period there was one recorded disaster, in 1635, when the ferry capsized and forty-seven people perished. The first cable ferry, powered by steam, commenced operation in 1870. New ferry boats were introduced to the route in 1915 and 1954, when a boat named Drake was introduced. The current ferry boat, named Mallard, was built in 1990 and can carry up to 18 cars and over 100 passengers. The ferry underwent its most recent five-yearly refit and full inspection in April/May 2014. The refit cost ¬£300,000 and involved rebuilding the engines and servicing all hydraulic, mechanical and electrical systems on the ferry, together with a full repaint. On 26 May 2018, the Mallard suffered an engine room fire which disabled the ferry during a crossing. One of the local cruise boats provided emergency assistance and took the passengers on board. Whilst the ferry was out of action, Cumbria County Council arranged for Windermere Lake Cruises to continue a reduced pedestrian crossing over the lake. The Mallard returned to service on 27 October after having been repaired and fitted with a new engine.

Sequatchie Valley is a relatively long and narrow valley in the U.S. state of Tennessee and, in some definitions, Alabama. It is generally considered to be part of the Cumberland Plateau region of the Appalachian Mountains; it was probably formed by erosion of a compression anticline, rather than rifting process as had been formerly theorized. The Sequatchie River drains the valley in Tennessee, flowing south to southwest from the southern part of Cumberland County, Tennessee to the Tennessee River near the Alabama border. Geologically, the Sequatchie Valley continues south of the Tennessee River into central Alabama. The Tennessee River flows through the Alabama portion of the valley to the vicinity of Guntersville, Alabama. The valley continues south of Guntersville, where it is called Browns Valley, drained by Browns Creek (Thornbury 1965:148). Although this whole valley is geologically the same, the name Sequatchie is commonly used only for the Tennessee portion of the valley, through which the Sequatchie River flows. A distinctive feature of the Sequatchie Valley is its straightness. From its northern end to its geological southern end at Browns Valley, the valley is almost perfectly straight. It is over 150 miles (240 km) long in the geologic sense and about 65 miles (105 km) long as the valley of the Sequatchie River. Its width is about 3‚Äì5 miles (5‚Äì8 km). The valley is bounded on either side by escarpments of the Cumberland Plateau. The portion of the plateau east of the valley is relatively narrow and known as Walden Ridge in Tennessee. To the west the plateau is simply called the Cumberland Plateau. In Bledsoe County, Tennessee a section of the west side escarpment is called Little Mountain, which also marks the Tennessee Valley Divide. In Alabama the plateau to the east of the valley is called Sand Mountain, while that to the west is Gunters Mountain. At its northern end, the Sequatchie Valley is marked by a more mountainous portion of the Cumberland Plateau known as the Crab Orchard Mountains. Between the main Crab Orchard Mountains and the Sequatchie Valley there is another valley, called Grassy Cove, located several miles north of Sequatchie Valley. Grassy Cove is a karst valley which, through underground erosion, should eventually become part of Sequatchie Valley (Thornbury 1965:149). Another, smaller karst valley, Bat Town Cove, is forming northeast of Grassy Cove, which may also grow and eventually become part of Sequatchie Valley. The Tennessee section of Sequatchie Valley contains the towns of Pikeville, Dunlap, Whitwell, Jasper, and, on the Tennessee River, South Pittsburg. Towns in the Alabama portion of the geologic valley include Bridgeport, Scottsboro, Guntersville, and, around the southern end, Blountsville.

He was a member of the council of safety in 1777, and a delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1790. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1797 to 1800. He served in the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1801 to 1804 and was speaker of the Senate in 1804 during the impeachment trials of the judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Whitehill was elected to the Ninth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John A. Hanna. He was reelected to the Tenth and to the three succeeding Congresses and served until his death at Lauther Manor, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. He was interred in Silver Spring Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Hampden Township, near Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Notable writings include the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, which he helped draft, and the Minority DissentLibrary of Congress: The Address and reasons of dissent of the minority of the convention, of the state of Pennsylvania, to their constituents. to the ratification of the US Constitution by Pennsylvania. This dissent included a number of proposed amendments to the US Constitution and is thought to have been used by James Madison when he drafted the United States Bill of Rights.Pennsylvania and The Federal Constitution 1787-1788 by James Wilson See also *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1790‚Äì1899) Sources *The Political Graveyard * Crist, Robert Grant.

Life Gehlhaar was the son of a German rocket scientist, who emigrated to the United States in 1953 to work at a rocket-development research centre in New Mexico (; ). Although he took an interest in music from the age of eight or younger, in the post-war years the family could not afford for him to learn an instrument, and so Rolf only began to play the piano at the age of fifteen, and at about the same time began to compose for fun . He took American citizenship in 1958 and studied at Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley . Initially, he had studied medicine, but soon changed his major to philosophy and the philosophy of science; then at Yale he attended a course in composition, which was an arousing experience . He moved to Cologne, Germany in 1967 to become assistant to Karlheinz Stockhausen, and became a member of his performing ensemble . In 1969, together with Johannes Fritsch and David C. Johnson, he founded the Feedback Studio, Cologne, a new-music performance center and publishing house. He later moved to England, where he became in 1979 a founding member of the Electro-Acoustic Music Association of Great Britain. In 2002 he Became Senior Lecturer in Design and Digital Media at Coventry University; at the time of his death he was Professor in Experimental Music at Coventry University, School of Art & Design. He also was a founding member of the British Paraorchestra and its technical director. His works are for both acoustic and electro-acoustic media, though he is best known for his work with computer- controlled composition, and for his interactive installations such as Sound=Space (1985), HeadSpace (2000), CaDaReMi (2006), Walking on Earth (2007), and has for many years collaborated with Luis Miguel Girao of Artshare, Aveiro, Portugal .

It represented the adjacent small towns of New Alresford and Old Alresford in Hampshire. According to John Arlott, between about 1770 and 1795 Alresford \\"stood higher in cricket than any town its size has done in the history of the game\\". During this period there were four grounds in Alresford. The main one was Itchin Stoke Down, which as of 1978 was part of Itchen Down Farm. Tichborne Down was also used for important games. Matches were also played on The Nythe and on Fob Down. Old Alresford and New Alresford often played each other, the latter usually winning, but for some fixtures they put out a joint team. Connections with Hambledon Its period of greatness roughly coincided with that of the even more eminent Hambledon, not too far distant. Many Alresford players also appeared for Hambledon, including Tom Taylor, Richard Aubrey Veck and the Freemantle brothers, Andrew and John. Some of Hambledon's matches, even including some fixtures with All-England, were played at Alresford. In 1778 Hambledon announced Most information about matches at this time comes from announcements in the press of matches to be played, with the reporting of scores - and even of results - being scanty. home and away fixtures with Alresford for fifty guineas a match, with no \\"given\\" men. At this period it was common for the weaker team to bring in players from outside, or from their opponents, to even things up.

Song information \\"Los Hermanos\\" is often considered a protest song. Some claim it criticizes the dictatorship of the Latin American countries, done to secure the fidelity of the region to the United States and, - by doing that -, avoiding undesirable leftist governments. That can be perceived on the song lyrics, which is an ode to fraternity and freedom with an implicit urge for Latin American union: \\"Yo tengo tantos hermanos Que no los puedo contar Y una novia muy hermosa... Que se llama Libertad\\". \\"I have so many brothers That I can't even count them And a beautiful bride... That is called Liberty\\". Though some take it as political, others contend that it has a broader universal appeal, with its verses about the common Argentine man, recognizing the others by the look in their eyes and realizing the difficulties they face in everyday life. Cover versions There are more than 25 versions of this song. Probably the best known cover version is that of Mercedes Sosa. She covered the song on her 1972 album Hasta la Victoria and again on her 1977 album Mercedes Sosa Interpreta a Atahualpa Yupanqui, her version changes the word \\"novia\\" (bride, fianc√©e) for \\"hermana\\" (sister), so she sings \\"...and (I have) a very beautiful sister whose name is Freedom\\". The widely acclaimed Brazilian MPB singer Elis Regina recorded \\"Los Hermanos\\" for her 1976 studio album Falso Brilhante.

Even though only partially sunk in shallow water, in 2012 the relatively new cruise liner Costa Concordia was declared a \\"constructive total loss\\" due to escalating environmental and salvage clean-up costs. In insurance claims, a total loss or write-off is a situation where the lost value, repair cost or salvage cost of a damaged property exceeds its insured value, and simply replacing the old property with a new equivalent is more cost-effective. Such a loss may be an \\"actual total loss\\" or a \\"constructive total loss\\". Constructive total loss considers further incidental expenses beyond repair, such as force majeure. General principles In a total loss, the insurer must indemnify the assured in full, and ownership of the insured item thereby passes to the insurer under the legal process of \\"subrogation\\". Although the policy determines the level at which the loss becomes total rather than partial, nevertheless the assured (and NOT the insurer) has the final say as to whether he wishes to make a partial or total claim. If the insured item is, say, a car or a house, the policy will normally give it a \\"market value\\" which may be less than the assured had in mind; any disagreement would need to be challenged, perhaps using arbitration. In marine insurance, policies may be valued (where the value of the ship or cargo is agreed) or unvalued (where a market value at the time of the claim would need to be ascertained). In the absence of fraud, the Marine Insurance Act 1906 states the agreed value in a valued policy is conclusive, except in cases of constructive total loss, as in the Costa Concordia and The Bamburi. The Bamburi [1982] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 312Case report extract Marine Insurance Law - Susan Hodges - Cavendish Written off properties are usually demolished or torn down, scrapped, or recycled for parts after their policies are settled; so the insurer may be relieved not to have the insured item subrogated to him, as in Asfar v Blundell [1896].Asfar v Blundell [1896] 1 QB 123 Policies covering homes, vehicles, and other non-investment assets subject to depreciation may indemnify the insured to much less than the full replacement cost, so that the insured items may become \\"total losses\\" despite some residual value. Auto insurance Much of this section only relates to the insurance industry in North America. Other jurisdictions, for example Australia, have their own regulations About written-off vehicles Written-off vehicles. About one in seven car accident claims results in a \\"total\\". Except in extreme circumstances, a vehicle that has been written off will not be completely worthless. This is because such a vehicle will usually still contain salvageable used parts, or at a bare minimum will still have value as scrap metal. All that is required for a vehicle to be a write-off is that it would cost more to return to marketable condition than the market value it would then have. So a vehicle of low value may even be written off when fully roadworthy, for example due to damage to paintwork or upholstery, such as from an interior fire, a \\"hail salvage\\", or bullet-riddled or \\"biohazard car\\" with toxic chemical spills or decomposing bodies found inside. A severely damaged automobile with repair costs greatly exceeding its value In many jurisdictions a vehicle designated as a total loss is sold by insurance companies to general public, auto dealers, auto brokers, or auto wreckers. The metrics insurance companies use to make the decision include the cost of the repairs needed plus the value of the remaining parts, added to the cost of reimbursing the driver for a rental while the car in question is repaired. If this figure exceeds the value of the car after it is repaired, the vehicle is deemed a total loss. In most jurisdictions, a decision by an insurer to write off a vehicle results in vehicle title branding, marking the car as \\"salvage\\" or (if repaired and reinspected under subsequent ownership) \\"rebuilt\\". If the vehicle is not severely damaged, however, it can be restored to its original condition. After a government approved inspection, the vehicle can be put back on the road. The inspection process may not attempt to assess the quality of the repairs. This function will be relegated to a professional mechanic or inspector. However, if the vehicle is severely damaged as per standards set by state or provincial governments, the vehicle is dismantled by an auto wrecker and is sold as parts or scrapped. Once a vehicle has been written off and repaired the vehicle may still lose value. Diminished value is the reduction in a vehicle's market value occurring after a vehicle is wrecked and repaired, otherwise called accelerated depreciation. To collect diminished value after a car accident, insurance companies usually ask for a diminished value report. In Canada, this is more commonly called accelerated depreciation; how a person goes about reclaiming those losses in either country is a different process. In some US states, insurance companies acknowledge diminished value and provide this coverage direct to their consumers. In Canada, in order to recuperate the lost value after an accident, a person needs to retain legal counsel and order an acceleration depreciation report on their car for the court's use. Categories In some parts of the world, automobile insurance write-offs are categorized according to the severity of the damage. For example, in the United Kingdom the Association of British Insurers provides for categories A, B, C, D, N, and S. Shipping In marine insurance, conventional marine insurers such as Lloyds will issue policies covering hull & machinery, or cargo, whereas P&I; clubs cover third-party risks (such as a carrier's damage to cargo), pollution risks, and war risks. The term \\"total loss\\" can refer to any of these risks, but commonly involves a loss of the hull or cargo. Total losses may be actual total loss or constructive. An actual total loss of a vessel occurs when repair is physically or legally impossible. A total loss may be presumed when a ship disappears and no news is received within a reasonable time. Some legal authorities do not consider it an actual total loss if repair costs are merely prohibitive, while others include cases where the cost of repair would exceed the cost of the vessel. In any case, the term \\"legally impossible\\" covers instances where reconstruction would be so extensive that the resulting craft would be legally considered a new vessel. A constructive total loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value of the vessel. It also covers cases where the vessel has been abandoned in the reasonable belief that a total loss is inevitable. The calculation can be affected by environmental cleanup costs. If the policy is a \\"valued\\" policy (so that the ship or cargo has an \\"agreed value\\" rather than a \\"market value\\"), then, in the absence of fraud, the agreed value is conclusive, but only for an actual total loss. In a constructive total loss, the agreed value is NOT conclusive.Marine Insurance Act 1906  Aviation  Richard Byrd's Fokker \\"America\\" was completely written off after its forced ditching in the Atlantic in June 1927. Byrd and three others survived. The original destination Paris was socked in by fog making a landing impossible at LeBourget. Souvenir hunters stripped the aircraft of its fabric skin and other components. In aviation, the term \\"hull loss\\" is used in aviation accidents that damage the aircraft beyond economical repair, resulting in a total loss. The term also applies to situations when the aircraft is missing, the search for its wreckage is terminated, or when the wreckage is completely inaccessible.

Lion & Safari Park is a conservation enclosure for lions, cheetahs, hyena, wild dogs and various antelope. It is located in the Cradle of Humankind in the North West province of South Africa.  The park  Landscape in Lion Park Feeding a giraffe One store within the Lion and Safari park Cub interactions at the Lion and Safari Park The Lion & Safari Park was originally a wildlife conservation enclosure for lions located in the Gauteng province in South Africa. In 2016, the park relocated to new premises of 600 hectare (ca. 1,500 acre) in the Cradle of Humankind in the North West province. The park is situated north of Lanseria Airport within driving distance of Johannesburg and Pretoria. It has a large variety of predators and large herbivores indigenous to Africa. The Lion & Safari Park is home to over 80 lions including the rare white lions and many other carnivores such as South African cheetah, Cape wild dog, brown hyena and spotted hyena, black-backed jackal, and a wide variety of antelope which roam freely in the antelope area. The antelope area, containing giraffe, warthog, blesbok, wildebeest, impala, gemsbok, and zebra, is a separate area away from the lions and other carnivores. In addition to the animal enclosures the new park has a children's play area, restaurants, conference facilities and a retail centre within five small domes. Guests are also able to hand-feed giraffes, ostriches and antelope. Twice a day the park also offers Lion walks and Cheetah walks in which clients, in the company of a park employee, follow the animal for a short walk within the park.  Cub interactions  Cub interactions involve the clients being in a separate enclosure with a lion cub for a short period of time during which photos can be taken and minimal interaction with the animal is possible. In 2015 the Lion & Safari Park banned cub interactions but found that visitor numbers dropped dramatically as people were going to other places that still offered cub interactions. In 2016 cub interactions were re-introduced as an additional part of a guided tour at the new premises of the park. The CEO, Rodney Fuhr, said that they had no choice since the \\"survival of our business will be at stake.\\" Non-profit organisation, Blood Lions, which is opposed to the exploitation of lions in any form, condemned the park and those who chose to visit it for the cub interactions. The park believes that they are managing the interactions with the cubs in a way that will not have a negative impact on the cubs. Attack On June 1, 2015, Katherine Chappell was visiting the original location of the park in the company of a tour operator, Pierre Potgieter of Kalabash tours. Chappell had opened her window and leant out to take photographs, against park rules, when a lion lunged through the window of the vehicle and bit her on the neck. Chappell died in the Lion Park of her wounds before the paramedics arrived. Potgieter fought off the lion and suffered injuries to his arms and an unconfirmed heart attack. Chappell had been visiting South Africa to work on the conservation of wildlife, and was raising funds for Wildlife ACT, a conservation charity. Unfortunately, this attack was not an isolated incident. In April 2015, an Australian named Brendan Smith, was attacked by a lion when he opened his car window. Smith survived the attack and later admitted that he was at fault for opening his window. Two days after the Australian incident a local boy rode through the park on his bicycle after having cut a hole in the fence. He was attacked by a cheetah but also survived.

Baggage cannot be checked at this location; however, up to two suitcases in addition to any \\"personal items\\" such as briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment are allowed on board as carry-ons. Amtrak does not provide ticketing or baggage service at this station, which is served by two trains daily. History The current Albion station house was built in 1882 by the Michigan Central Railroad, which originally ran through town in 1844. The station also had a freight house. Ten years earlier Albion had competition when the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway arrived and added its own station, which operated until the 1920s. The red brick depot is a well- preserved example of a Victorian station with earlier Italianate details, such as three sided bays with fancy double brackets supporting the eaves. Colored and glazed brick in shades of white form two beltcourses that encircle the structure. Plain pilasters divide the window bays, each of which features deep corbelling. The trackside bay is topped by a gable with bargeboard and woodwork associated with the Eastlake decorative style. Wrought-iron fencing is found along the ridge of the roof, while two prominent chimneys with corbelling crown the structure. The Albion station was abandoned in 1971, when Amtrak consolidated all cross-country passenger rail service within the United States. However it was restored to its original condition by local community groups in the mid-1980s and currently serves as both a bus and train station. The freight house was also restored and converted into a local sports bar known as Davan's, which has since closed.

He subsequently played guitar and keyboard for the hard rock band UFO, blues rock guitarist Gary Moore, and Wild Horses. He is credited for co-writing a number of Gary Moore's songs including the worldwide hit \\"Empty Rooms\\". At 30 he left the rock world and developed a different career as both teacher of woodwind (saxophone and clarinet) and as an ABRSM examiner. 2010 saw an unexpected return to rock with Gary Moore, playing festivals across Europe and a tour of Ukraine and Russia. Future tours and a Celtic rock album were to follow but this was curtailed by the death of Gary Moore in February 2011. On 30 April 2019, it was announced that he would return to UFO for their 'Last Orders' tour, following the death of Paul Raymond with Neil replacing Paul.

The ferry crosses between the parishes of Feock and Philleigh, roughly halfway between the city of Truro, the lowest bridging point on the estuary, and the town of Falmouth, at the estuary's mouth. The ferry is owned and operated by the King Harry Steam Ferry Company Ltd. The current ferry boat, named No. 7, was built in 2006 and can carry up to 34 cars. History It is likely that there has been a ferry of some description at the King Harry Passage for centuries, but there are conflicting stories about the origins of the name. One such story is that King Henry VIII spent his honeymoon with Anne Boleyn at St Mawes, and signed a charter for the ferry on this site. A more likely origin lies in the fact that a small chapel formerly stood on the Philleigh side of the passage. All that remains of this today is a small pile of stones, but is mentioned in 1528 as \\"The Chapel of St. Mary and King Henry\\", commemorating King Henry VI, murdered in 1471. The King Harry Steam Ferry was initiated in 1888 as a submerged chain ferry Bridge, using a steam engine to pull the ferry along the chains, and replacing a manually propelled barge that was previously used on the route. As its name suggests, the current ferry bridge is the seventh vessel to be used since 1888. Although the owning company has retained the words Steam Ferry in its name, all ferries since 1956 have used diesel-electric propulsion. The company is now owned by a syndicate of five local families. Description The crossing of the River Fal has been voted one of the ten most scenic ferry trips in the world by The Independent, alongside the Staten Island Ferry in New York and the Star Ferry in Hong Kong. The Feock terminal of the ferry is adjacent to the renowned Trelissick Gardens. A toll is charged for vehicular use of the ferry; a charitable donation is invited from pedestrians. Local people purchase concession tickets to keep the price low. If the ferry is not operating, the alternative is a detour via the city of Truro. References Further reading *Henderson, C.

The show takes place in the fictional Landmark City and focuses on five teenagers, the eponymous Alpha Teens on Machines, who are given prototype weapons, gadgets and vehicles in order to battle Alexander Paine, a man who threatens to destroy Landmark City. Alpha Teens The Alpha Teens are teenagers who participated in a TV contest and won. Their prize was being hired by Mr. Lee to use his prototype devices. Axel Manning Axel Manning (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is the eighteen-year-old leader of A.T.O.M., and a master of the Jo-Lan martial art. Jo-Lan combines the body and mind, allowing each punch, kick, etc. to land with a burst of energy. When Axel was 8, his father, Sebastian Manning, was supposedly killed in an explosion by who was assumed to be Paine, but later found to be someone else. Axel still searches for the truth on what really happened. Axel enjoys adventure and will push his body to its limits. Possibly the team's most level-headed member, Axel feels bad when he feels he put someone in danger and for a long time, blamed himself for his father's death. He and King become close friends and he also seems to have feelings for Lioness and has saved her numerous times. During Season 1, Axel hated Paine for (he first assumed) betraying and killing his father. This and Paine's attempts to take over Landmark City, lead to many battles between the two before Paine was imprisoned again. In Season 2, when Mr. Lee's true intentions were revealed, Axel felt betrayed and angrily promised that he'd do everything in his power to stop him. Axel has brown hair and gray eyes, his Alpha Team uniform is black and orange. He actually looks oddly similar to Paine. His personalized equipment include the Turboboard and the Thunderbike 3000. The only other family that he mentioned were his parents: his father is held captive in Serpent's Tail's prison; his mother's fate remains unknown. His catchphrases are \\"Gear it up!\\" as well as yelling out the names of his techniques, whenever he uses them. His four main Jo-Lan based attacks are: *Jo-Lan Choubatsu (Jo-Lan Super-strike or possibly Jo-Lan Intestine Strike), which, as the name suggests, is a strike to the gut using the energy of Jo-Lan emanating from the palms of his hands (similar to Hadouken). *Jo-Lan Ryuuseiken (Jo-Lan Dragon Spirit Fist), a spinning uppercut (similar to Shoryuken). *Uzumaki Jo-Lan Kick (Whirlpool Jo-Lan Kick), a spinning kick, with the number of spins varying between episodes (similar to Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku). *Super Jo-Lan (Super Jo-Lan Choubatsu), a normal Jo-Lan choubatsu, only its power is magnified 10X times, it is a move that Axel used to devastate Pain at the end of the 1st season (similar to a Metsu Hadouken). Ryoku Jo-Lan - This attack quite similar to Jo-Lan Choubatsu but with more power and release more energy. Axel can also use this attack to knock himself out (see episode 22 season 1 \\"The great sleep\\"). King Crey \\"King\\" Kingston (voiced by Aldis Hodge) is nineteen years old and is the oldest member of the team. He is a gentle giant with superhuman strength who is skilled in various forms of Wrestling such as Greco-Roman wrestling, submission wrestling and pro-wrestling. King can rip through doors and walls with little effort; his power equals that of Axel when Axel uses his Jo-Lan special attacks. King also is tech savvy with computers, which he has shown on more than one occasion. His father brought him to Blue Pines National Park in the outskirts of Landmark City. The experience changed him to the King that he is now. King also loves animals except for butterflies, which he is afraid of. He would almost go postal when animals are being mistreated in any way. King also has numerous exotic pets including a cat, Sparky the gopher, Clarence the Brazilian tree frog who turned out to be female and had many babies, Benny the porcupine and Fluffy the bat. He has also temporarily housed other animals at various periods of time and loves to nurse them back to health. King has a big appetite and eats enormous portions of food. His favorite eating establishment is \\"Captain Doughnut\\". Although he gets along pretty well with everyone on the team, Axel seems to be his closest friend. He is also the wrestling coach for the Landmark City School for the Gifted, his brother Duke's school. In Season 1, King has battled Flesh scores of times with King being the usual victor because he's smaller, smarter and sightly faster. He also has tangled with Vinnie Rossi, once when he was human winning the WWC world title in a wrestling match. Then when he changed into Mass, he barely defeated him in a hospital. King is bald-headed, but has a black goatee and green eyes, his Alpha Team uniform is white and orange. His personalized equipment include the Power Ram and the Thunderquad 3000. King has a big intermediate family with three brothers who in his words \\"eat like pigs\\". His catchphrase is: \\"Get out of my grill!\\". Lioness Catalina \\"Lioness\\" Leone (voiced by Alli Mauzey) is the youngest on the team at the age of seventeen. She is a talented Afro- Brazilian songwriter and singer who practices capoeira. Her agility and athletic ability make her a very effective fighter. She is not the unique girl of the Alpha Team; she can hold her own in battle and has exhibited more courage than the others, mainly Hawk and Shark. Like Axel, Lioness thrives on challenge and will push her body to its limits. Lioness had two fears, Paine's powers and public speaking, both of which she eventually overcame. She grew up with four brothers, named: Alexander, Antonio, Edvardo, and Fernando. So she understands how guys think and act. Lioness' father, known as Thrash, is a superstar and comes to visit her in one episode. She has a crush on Axel and is jealous of Magness when she flirts with him. While deep down Lioness does not hate Hawk, she is probably the least tolerant of his boisterous ego. She is also part of a group of capoeira performers in her off time. Lioness has fought and defeated Spydah on numerous occasions during Season 1. She also has developed a tense rivalry with Paine's daughter Magness because of Axel. Lioness has brown hair and gold eyes, and given the physical appearance of her father is probably mulatto. Her Alpha Team uniform is green and white. Her personalized equipment include the Tag Blaster and the MTX 9000. Along with her brothers, Lioness also has a cousin named Eliza, who came to visit once in the episode \\"Remote Control\\" and fancied Garrett. Her catchphrase is: \\"¬°Vamos!\\". Hawk Zack \\"Hawk\\" Hawkes (voiced by Charlie Schlatter) is an eighteen-year-old gifted test pilot who is more at home in the air than on the ground, both due to his piloting skill and his huge ego. He is too not much of a hand-to-hand fighter. He has used a Muay Thai fighting stance more than once, getting knocked down each time he did it. He also was not able to swim until Lioness and a lifeguard named Laura taught him the basics. Before his time with the Alpha Teens, Hawk was enrolled in a flight school where he developed a rivalry with another pilot named Bogey. They pushed each other to see who was the best pilot, but Bogey's actions almost got them both killed. Both men were expelled after Bogey put all the blame on Hawk for the incident during an inquest. Hawk's aforementioned ego often annoys the rest of the team (and almost everybody else he meets) and sometimes is counterproductive on their missions. Because of this, he often strikes out with the ladies, including Lioness when he tried to pick her up when they first met. Despite this, Hawk is very serious about protecting innocent lives as well as his piloting skills (e.g. he refuses to evacuate a damaged aircraft unless he makes sure it lands safely). Hawk is a serious actor, when not fighting villainy or testing vehicles for Lee Industries. His two biggest claims to fame are starring in the sci-fi b-movie, \\"Radioactive Island\\" in the first season and advertising \\"Worrywart\\" wart cream in a TV commercial in the second; the latter he is teased for. He is also becoming a good friend to Shark, despite his clean freak nature contrasting with Shark's sloppiness. Hawk has light red hair and green eyes; his Alpha Team uniform is blue and orange. His personalized equipment includes the Jetwing and the Rotarbike 3000. Hawk has parents and possibly more family, which he describes as one being \\"...more superficial than the next\\". His catchphrases are: \\"Hawk flies in, he saves the day\\" and \\"Oh yeah, who rocks?!\\". Shark Ollie Herbert \\"Shark\\" Sharker (voiced by Brian Donovan) is an eighteen-year-old laid back surfer who is most at home in the water. A student of oceanography, Shark's is a great asset during water-based missions or while testing water-based vehicles for Lee Industries. Like Hawk, Shark isn't very accomplished fighter, but he is very skilled at evasion due to his knowledge of balance and the reflexes he gained from surfing. While most of the time, Shark is a calm and relaxed individual, when Axel was poisoned by Paine's men, he proved himself to be an effective leader. Throughout the series, a connection is forming between him and Hawk despite his sloppiness and Hawk's clean freak nature and huge ego. Shark has blond hair and blue eyes, his Alpha Team uniform is yellow and blue. His personalized equipment include the Scubashark and the Sharkski 3000. Shark's mother is his only reference to a family currently. His catchphrase is \\"Shake the sand out of your shorts, dude\\". Antagonists Paine's gang Paine's gang is a criminal group that serves as the main antagonist of the first season. Alexander Paine Alexander Paine (voiced by Clancy Brown) is an evil crime boss who seeks to take over Landmark City and serves as the main antagonist of the first season. He is a former covert ops spy for the government, and worked closely with Axel Manning's father, Sebastian Manning. Paine, in reality, was a double agent who sought world domination. When Sebastian discovered this, he confronted Paine, who was equipped with a bomb. As the two fought, the bomb went off. Paine's body was scarred and Sebastian Manning was labeled dead as a result. Paine was given life imprisonment for the murder of Sebastian Manning. He served ten years at Talon Penitentiary, Landmark City's triple-maximum security prison, before Spydah helped break him out. He ran into Sebastian Manning's 18-year-old son, Axel, who sought revenge for his father and wanted Paine back in jail. Due to a freak accident that Axel caused, Paine's nervous system was permanently damaged. Because of this, he is in constant pain, but has the ability to transfer his intense pain to whomever he touches. Controlling a group of convicts from Talon, including Spydah and Flesh, Paine seeks to cause chaos and disorder in Landmark City, giving him an opportunity to take it over. Paine is also an accomplished martial artist. He and Axel fought many times during Season 1. After the Alpha Teens destroyed his base, Paine wanted to get rid of Axel once and for all. In what seemed like what was going to be their final battle, Paine revealed to Axel that he did not detonate the bomb that presumably killed his father. Paine was eventually defeated and sent back to jail. In Season 2, Paine was sent a picture and was frightened. He asked for bodyguards and as a result, Axel and his Team were hired to protect Paine. But Dragon kidnapped Paine. Axel rescued Paine and gave him a picture of Sebastian and an unknown man. Paine said if Axel finds the man in the picture, he'll find the truth about his father. Paine is an accomplished pianist and seems to be well educated. While Spydah and Flesh carry out most of his plans, Paine is not above hiring others to aid in said plans. He sometimes replaces Spydah and Flesh if they fail him or if he thinks that they are obsolete compared to whoever he hires. Paine uses his power on his minions capriciously, usually if they say or do something unintelligent or counterproductive. Paine has black hair with red highlights and red eyes; he usually wears black pants and jacket, and a red T-shirt. He actually looks oddly similar to Axel. His personalized equipment includes the Jet Burner and the Street Shredder. Paine's daughter is Samantha, aka Magness. He is very protective of her well being. Spydah Roger \\"Spydah\\" Marcel (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a minion of Paine who broke out of jail with him. He can create insect-themed machines which he treats as his pets. He wears a helmet equipped with six mini-cameras with night vision and infra-red capabilities. His eight detachable mechanical arms provide him with strength, dexterity, and climbing ability. He is also Paine's tech expert building or retooling machine's for Paine's plans. Spydah helped to break Paine out of prison and is very loyal to him. He has fought all the members of the Alpha Teens but usually fights Lioness. In most of these confrontations he was usually beaten. At the end of season 1 he was defeated by Lioness, King, Shark and Hawk and then arrested with Paine after they failed to destroy Axel and the team's base. He has since appeared in Season two, teamed up with Magness and D-Zel. He is finally arrested and returns in prison. Spydah wants Paine to respect him; however, he has been a victim of Paine's insults and pain touch powers more often than not. He also thinks little of Flesh, who he considers to be big and stupid, even before his accident. Spydah's design is inspired by Marvel Comics character Doctor Octopus. Flesh Albert \\"Flesh\\" (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) was once a normal human who was a bodybuilding (he was as strong as King) thug who idolized Paine. He was hired by Paine to help him and Spydah steal Nutronium (a chemical that apparently could end Paine's pain) from Lee Industries. With the Alpha Teens' interference and the Nutronium not being where he thought it was, Paine threw a fit of rage. In his rage, Paine threw chemicals across the room he was in that accidentally hit Albert. This caused his body to mutate and grow to freakish proportions which also granted him super-human strength, far-surpassing King. While initially very angry with Paine, he reminded Albert who he idolized, causing him to regain his self-control. Taking the name Flesh, an insult used by Lioness, he stayed working with Paine full-time. It has been implied that Paine was meant to cure Flesh after he took over Landmark City. Even before his accident, his barbells are his favorite weapons and as Flesh he is able to throw them with great precision. Sometimes they return to him like boomerangs. Flesh has fought all the members of the Alpha Teens but usually fights King. In most of these confrontations he was usually beaten because even though Flesh is much stronger, King wins by outwitting him. At the end of season 1 he was defeated by Axel when he tried to escape with Paine and Spydah after they robbed a bank. He was arrested and sent to prison. He appears briefly in prison in Season 2 where he shares his cell with Spydah and Recombo. Flesh prides himself on his muscles and he loves being strong. He makes it clear in his debut episode that he doesn't like weak people. He doesn't like Spydah and he thinks that he's a freak and a weakling. Though Spydah implies that Flesh wasn't too smart before his accident, afterwards he says and does stupid things that often anger Paine. Like Spydah, he is often on the receiving end of Paine's pain powers when he does something Paine doesn't like. Mr. Lee and the Mu-Team They are the main villains of the second season. Mr. Lee Janus Lee (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the inventor and founder of Lee Industries. A rich and successful businessman, he held various assets throughout the city (e.g. banks, prisons, hospitals, malls, labs, factories, plazas etc.) and over 6,000 separate patents on inventions. He was the one who started the Alpha Teens team after he tested them on his game show, \\"Trackdown\\" in season 1. He gave them access to Lee Industries vehicles for testing and also let them use them to stop Paine or any other villain threatening Landmark City. In both cases the vehicles usually end up getting trashed, mostly being unintentional, but Lee always paid for new ones. After a crazy disgruntled former employee of Lee Industries named Silas Green was defeated by the Alpha Teens, he tried to warn them about Lee betraying them just like he did him. Due to him trying to kill them moments earlier, Green's message fell on mostly deaf ears with Hawk dismissing him as paranoid. Afterwards, Lee's true nature slowly began to reveal itself. He began to act suspiciously doing things like mysteriously pocketing Hawk and Shark's loose hair and lying or misinforming the team about his whereabouts when he goes on business. After Paine raided Lee Industries, Axel and Garrett stumbled into a room that was off limits to anyone but Lee. In it was DNA samples of the team and five new uniforms. At the end of season 1, it was revealed that Lee genetically created a reptilian-like creature dubbed the \\"Axel Manning advanced enhancement\\". In season 2 following Paine is defeated, Mr. Lee fires the Alpha Team, stripping them of their access to Lee Industries and its vehicles and of their credit line. He apologizes twice and explains that the company \\"...is moving away from vehicles and into bio-tech\\". After Axel had some lethal run-ins with the reptilian-like creature, Lee tracks it down and reveals to Axel that the creature, whom Lee named Tilian, is Axel's clone. He states that he started work on Tilian shortly after he met Axel. Lee's reasoning for doing this is to save the world from war, greed and ignorance using genetic engineering. He intends to \\"...create a race of creatures that can outperform, outthink and outlast any mere human\\". Also, he intends to create these creatures similar in appearance to humans to make sure that they get positions in power with Lee admitting that he will lead initially. After hearing that this is why Lee formed the Alpha Teens in the first place, Axel felt angry and betrayed and stated that he would do everything in his power to stop him. The rest of the team, Garrett and the board of directors for Lee Industries were also informed of Lee's plans. The board of directors promptly stripped Lee of all his power, but not before he experimented on himself. Lee sought to make himself fifty times stronger and smarter than he already was. After Tilian was knocked into the pod Lee was in, it exploded and while Lee survived, he lost what reason he had left making him completely insane. He revealed to Axel that Tilian was part of a Mu-Team, which will help him complete his objective to \\"help\\" mankind. Also, Lee has created an armor made out of hard light technology (light images that actual can come in physical contact with solid and liquid materials). He is also now able to form a vehicle out of hard light thanks to King's temporally evil brother, Duke. He also has seemed to work with Recombo in the past. Mu- Team The Mu-Team are genetically altered clones of the Alpha Teens by Mr. Lee. Each member has the traits of who they are cloned from and the animals they had mutated into their DNA. They are fiercely loyal to Mr. Lee and are very aggressive. Their members include: * Tilian (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is mutated from cobra, crocodile, gecko, chameleon and Axel's DNA where he sports green scales and orange hair as well as being taller and stronger. He first appears in the first episode of season 2 by tracking down Axel. Tilian was defeated by Axel and he fell down a rock face under Mr. Lee's mansion. Mr. Lee recovered him and made him apparently ten times better by mixing Axel's DNA with Mutanium (an unstable chemical) and putting it into Tilian. He can shoot venom from his fangs that hardens and immobilizes any body part it touches temporarily, change color to blend in with surfaces and regenerate lost limbs. * Wrecka (voiced by Aldis Hodge) he is mutated from elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and King's DNA where he sports blue skin and a horn on his head. He first appears in the third episode of season 2 with Firekat. They were sent by Mr. Lee to destroy Axel and the rest of the team. Wrecka has super strength and an elephant's charging power. Wrecka's rhino horn is also a great asset especially when Mr. Lee upgrades Wrecka to emit electricity from it. * Firekat (voiced by Alli Mauzey) is mutated from cheetah, lion, cougar, tiger and Lioness' DNA where she sports cat ears, claws, and a tail. She first appears in the third episode of season 2 with Wrecka. They were sent by Mr. Lee to destroy Axel and the rest of the team. Firekat has the speed of the cheetah, the ability to slice completely through some of the hardest surfaces, and powerful jumping ability. She also has a giant metal claw as a weapon. In her free time, Firekat likes to clean herself like a cat. * Stingfly (voiced by Charlie Schlatter) he is mutated from hornet, wasp, dragonfly, beetle and Hawk's DNA. He first appears in the fourth episode of season 2 with Rayza. He was sent by Mr. Lee to take care of the Alpha Teens, who set to save Shark and Dr. Logan. Stingfly's insect wings gives him the ability to fly. He can also stick to walls, uses banshee-like howling to stun enemies, and shoot acid eggs from his tail. * Rayza (voiced by Brian Donovan) is mutated from piranha, eel, jellyfish, barracuda and Shark's DNA. He first appears in the fourth episode of season 2 with Stingfly. He was sent by Mr. Lee to find and capture the government genetic scientist, Dr. Logan. Rayza can bite through metal, breathe both underwater and on land with his gills, shoot laser beams from his arms, and emit electricity from his body like an electric eel. Dragon Dragon (voiced by Keith Szarabajka) is a ninja mercenary and the only Eastern Jo-Lan master and is first seen when he was hired by unknown clientele to steal an inhibitor that drains its wearer of their strength. He met Paine when he and Paine were unexpectedly robbing the same place. Paine sent Spydah and Flesh to take care of him only for Dragon to easily defeat them both. An impressed Paine knew he was both a Jo-Lan master and a mercenary and tripled his pay to give him the inhibitor and capture Axel Manning. He finds the latter task slightly harder than expected. The situation gets complicated with the other Alpha Teens intervene. Dragon succeeds in his mission after he catches Axel completely off guard. When Dragon learns that Axel is the son of Sebastian Manning and seeing how Paine was going to kill Axel while he was wearing the inhibitor, Dragon cuts the inhibitor off him, telling Paine that \\"A Jo-Lan warrior deserves to meet his end with honor\\" and that he completed his job. Paine was furious and ordered Spydah and Flesh to attack them, but the Alpha Teens found them and helped defeat them and destroy the inhibitor. After Axel and Dragon both briefly fought Paine, Dragon forces Axel into another fight. The battle was a near stalemate and Dragon retreated vowing that they'd meet again. Axel tried to find out what Dragon know about his father, but it was too late as Dragon disappeared. Dragon was next seen in Hong Kong when both he and the Alpha Teens were trying to stop the power hungry Terrance Yao from misusing the power of the Sword of Jo-Lan. They were successful in defeating Yao and Axel trusted Dragon to keep the Sword of Jo- Lan safe. The move Dragon used to defeat Yao was apparently only known by Sebastian Manning which Dragon confirms but when Axel inquired if he had learned the move from his father, Dragon avoided the question and leaped off. At the end of season one, he stands atop a rooftop, when a newspaper in the wind blows at his feet. He reads that Paine was arrested and throws the newspaper back into the wind. Dragon feels a true warrior must walk their path alone, as opposed to Axel's view that his friends give him strength. In \\"Fathers and Sons\\", Dragon is revealed to be a clone of Sebastian Manning, created by Lee during the Chrysalis project. Magness Samantha \\"Magness\\" Paine (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) is the daughter of Alexander Paine. She has had magnetic powers since birth. The extent of which is her ability to control most metals (gold being one exception), disrupting electronics, levitation and canceling Jo-Lan powers. Her magnetic powers are increased in extreme cold, i.e. a snowy mountain. But her powers are weakened by extreme heat, i.e. fire. Magness also knows martial arts to the point where she can keep up with Axel in a fair fight. While Magness is Paine's daughter, she is not officially part of his gang. When the Alpha Teens go on vacation at a ski resort on Iron Mountain, a mountain made up mostly of iron ore, they first met Magness, under the guise of the ski resort's doctor. She tells them that a bunch of Landmark City's top officials, including its mayor, were meeting at the resort for a conference on crime. Right away she started flirting with Axel. When a suspicious (and jealous) Lioness discovers her powers, Magness takes action tying her up with the resorts true doctor. Magness was ordered by Paine use her powers to vibrate the iron ore in the mountain to cause an avalanche burying Landmark City's officials alive. Paine also warned her about the Alpha Teens, so she tried to keep them out of the way and kill Axel personally. She and Axel fought with his powers negated by hers. She accidentally ignited some fuel in a bunker, lighting it on fire. This made it hot enough for Axel to get his Jo-Lan powers back and defeat Magness. Before she could be taken into custody Paine rescues her and they escape in his helicopter. Magness returns to Landmark City dating a street biker named D-Zel. When the two of them went to a night club they got into an unexpected confrontation with the Alpha Teens sans Hawk (who was home \\"cooking\\"). Paine was not pleased with her actions. On the heels of his latest plan, Paine told her to keep a low profile calling D-Zel a greaseball. She then sneaks out with Paine's Street Shredder and with D-Zel decide to get a new bike from Lee's R & D lab. Again unexpectedly, the two face off with the Alpha Teens. After D-Zel is accidentally merged with the new bike they were going to steal, he and Magness escape, in a sense getting what they wanted. After Magness and D-Zel beat Paine to the punch on his plan and escaping from Paine, the Alpha Teens, and the police, Paine took the heat for the robbery. Angered that she was not given the credit for the heist, she finds out on TV that the Alpha Teens are temporally located at Mr. Lee's San Solomon estate. With D-Zel and his biker buddies, Magness sought to take out the Alpha Teens once and for all. At San Solomon, Magness and the bikers attack the Alpha Teens with Magness going after Lioness. She was lured by Lioness into Lee's ancient Egyptian exhibit room. Lioness kicks Magness into a gold covered sarcophagus. While D-Zel and the other bikers were also defeated and arrested, Magness was saved by and escaped with Spydah after she called Paine for help. She was not seen again until the end of season 1, where she's seen on Landmark City's JumboTron that the Alpha Teens help police re-capture her father. She is so angry that she screams and uses her powers to blow up the JumboTron. She has since appeared in Season two, forming her own gang with D-Zel and Spydah. She is the only of three to successfully escape the prison. Magness has black hair with red highlights and violet eyes. Her uniform is black with red trim. Magness is a rebel who seems to be interested in and knowledgeable about motorcycles and off-road vehicles. While Paine instills fear and control in his minions and the citizens of Landmark City, Magness often challenges her father's authority. She disobeys him constantly but still he bails her out of trouble anyway. Other villains The following villains either are one-time associates of Alexander Paine or operate on their own: Cannonball Bros. The Cannonball Brothers are sibling acrobats that were prisoners at Talon Penitentiary until Paine broke them out. They worked for a circus where they would pickpocket valuables from their audience after the shows. Paine came to them stating that they owed him for breaking them out. The two helped Paine and Spydah break into Lee Industries to find Axel Manning and his team. The fought and easily outmatched King, Hawk and Shark but were defeated by Lioness with one kick. They were arrested when the police arrived. The duo made a cameo appearance in the WWC battle royal for the WWC title along with King and Vinnie Rossi. Whether if this was really them or two guys dressed like them is unknown. When Hawk and King were unjustly arrested, the Cannonball Bros. were two of the villains to make their stay in prison very difficult. After King and Recombo started a food fight, they and the other villains imprisoned because of the Alpha Teens attacked King and Hawk. Lioness, who came with Axel to breakout their teammates, tricks these two into thinking that she thinks they're cute. As the Alpha Teens escape from the prison, Lioness being the last one out, the brothers chase her but get stuck in the hole she dived in. They were used to seal off the Alpha Teens escape route. The Cannonball Brothers are athletically gifted, but they lack intelligence. They also bicker back and forth like little children at times. Architect Silas Greene (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal) is the genius designer of Lee Plaza, whom Mr. Lee had fired before the completion of the project. Greene stated that Lee was going to say that he was imbalanced as the reason of his termination. Calling Lee a \\"two-faced personification of backstabbing corporate greed\\", Greene wanted vengeance and \\"his building\\", Lee Plaza. Thus, he became the Architect. Intending to kill Mr. Lee as well as the Alpha Teens and the head of Landmark City's Building Security Board, the Architect controlled the entire building from the command center in its penthouse. He used the building's robotic security drones, waste management system (robots that vaporize trash), ventilation system, elevator system and trash incinerator and his own added features like mobile electric wires that can fire lasers as well as a laser grid in the ladies room to accomplish this. Axel, Hawk, Lioness and Mr. Lee reached the Penthouse but the Architect escaped and attempted to blow them up by overloading the room's power core but failed after the room's reinforced safety chamber kicked in. In a last-ditch effort to not get caught, the Architect activated every security drone he could to stop them, he also rerouted the gasoline into the building's sprinkler system. This effort was in vain as he was eventually driven to the roof, where Lee and Axel waited for him. The seemingly defeated Architect had one last trick up his sleeve, turning many security drones into a giant robotic mech that encased him. He knocked Lee off the building, unaware that he was saved by a window washing platform. With a combined shots from the Lioness, Hawk, Shark, King and the Security Board head using the technology the Architect himself manipulated and a Jo-Lan powered uppercut from Axel, the Architect was knocked off the building slamming into the ground below. With his robotic mech destroyed, the Architect was detained by police. Before he went to prison, he attempted to tell the Alpha Teens not to trust Lee and for them not to believe anything he says. While the Alpha Teens didn't believe him after he just tried to kill them, unfortunately for them he was right. When Hawk and King were unjustly arrested, Architect was one of the villains to make their stay in prison very difficult. After King and Recombo started a food fight, he and the other villains imprisoned because of the Alpha Teens attacked King and Hawk. The Architect was seen being chased by prison guards in the background during Bogey and Hawk's fight. Silas Greene is very intelligent but he is so overcome with hatred for Mr. Lee, that he doesn't care who he hurts to get to him. He is crazed to be certain, but it's never explained how or when he got that way or if Lee was telling the truth about his termination at all. Greene also seems to like opera, breaking out into song every time he's about to unleash a major attack. The Architect is similar to X-Men villain Arcade. Recombo Dr. Recombo (voiced by Danny Mann) is a genetic scientist who experimented with animals by fusing them together. He can control these creature's DNA by special remote and has several of these creatures under and at his disposal. Also, he experimented on himself, turning him into a vicious creature that can stretch his limbs. He hid his true appearance under a disguise that looked like his old body. His colleagues, who gave him his moniker, seemingly laughed at him and told that such experimentation couldn't be done. Bent on proving them wrong, Recombo took shelter on an island inside an abandoned radiation testing lab from the 1950s. He discovered that the radiation from the tests turned the lava in the island's volcano green. The green lava can alter all forms of DNA. When Recombo extracts and redefines the lava, he can use it to combine different species into new more powerful super-species. With hidden cameras on the island Recombo became aware of the film crew that was stationed on the island to film \\"Radioactive Island\\" which was supposed to star Hawk. King's aggression against the movie's giant robotic crab impressed both the film's director (who replaced Hawk as the lead) as well as Recombo. With intentions of ruling the world, Recombo has his eyes set on King as a worthy human specimen for his experiments. He captures King and fuses him with one of his already mutated creatures. When Axel, Shark and Lioness come to save King, Recombo has the now mutated King and his other creatures to attack them. King breaks free of his control but is weakened by Recombo's control. Lioness recovers Recombo's remote and sets the creatures free. An angered Recombo shows the Alpha Teens his true form, a freakish genetically altered monster. The mutated King does battle with Recombo. Recombo is defeated by King and Lioness and the team returns King to normal. As the Alpha Teens left the island, they dropped Recombo off with the authorities on the next island. When Hawk and King were unjustly arrested, Recombo was one of the villains to make their stay in prison very difficult. Recombo seems to be a mostly normal human now with the exception of his frog jumping skill and long, sticky and strong frog's tongue. He still held a grudge against King for him not accepting \\"higher evolution\\" and getting Recombo sent to prison. After he and King started a food fight, he and the other villains imprisoned because of the Alpha Teens attacked King and Hawk. Recombo was defeated by Axel after he and Lioness came to breakout King and Hawk. It has been revealed that Recombo created a mutant creature out of a baby tiger cub. The creature escaped into Blue Pines National Park where the Alpha Teens were taking a vacation. The Alpha Teens stop the beast, but begin to form a connection between Recombo and Mr. Lee. Eel Dr. E. Elle aka Eel (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a scientist with a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. He has a full bodysuit equipped with a mask and an arm cannon that can fire electricity. He uses mind control discs to make sea creatures (sharks, swordfish, squid etc.) his obedient pets. Also, he was able to create seaweed that grow very rapidly and wrap around intruders. Eel started a project called \\"Neptune's Revenge\\" where he used his \\"pets\\", namely a giant squid to sink ships. The project was funded by Paine who sought to get rid of Axel Manning and the rest of the Alpha Teens, who were at a party on Mr. Lee's yacht. Shark unintentionally stumbled across this plan when he was caught by Eel's giant squid while he was swimming. When the others at Mr. Lee's party started to get worried, Axel and King went to search for him. Meanwhile, Lee's yacht was being attacked by two giant squids. Axel and King followed Shark's Scubasled to where it had been tracked and found Eel's lab. The two saved Shark who explained what's been going on and found out that Paine is behind it. Axel confronted Eel one on one. The two fought until Axel used a Jo-Lan attack on Eel accidentally making him blast part of his lab. With his lab and life's work being destroyed as a result, Axel, King and Shark force Eel to surrender. He was detained by the three as they saved Mr. Lee, Lioness and Hawk from the sinking ship. Eel was taken to prison shortly afterwards. When Hawk and King were unjustly arrested, Eel was one of the villains to make their stay in prison very difficult. Without his bodysuit, Eel had light blue skin and dark blue hair. He was also able to sneak in a pet electric eel that willingly listens to him. He sent the eel from his sink to the sink in Hawk and King's cell. It attacked Hawk before escaping down the drain. After King and Recombo started a food fight, he and the other villains imprisoned because of the Alpha Teens attacked King and Hawk. Lioness, who came with Axel to breakout their teammates, kicked a cup of water at Eel and his pet, electrocuting them both. Bogey Bogey (voiced by Thomas F. Wilson) is a highly talented hotshot pilot who has history with Hawk. As a flight school student, Bogey and Hawk pushed each other to see who was the best pilot, but Bogey's reckless actions almost got them both killed. As a result, both men were expelled after Bogey put the whole blame on Hawk for the incident during an inquest. They haven't seen each other until Bogey disrupted Hawk's solo performance at an airshow. After a brief verbal exchange, they agreed to race around Landmark City. After Bogey flew through a building that was under construction, something Hawk avoided so he would not hurt anyone, Bogey won the race. After they landed, Hawk confronted Bogey which led to a fight after Bogey said that he was the better pilot. It turns out that Bogey was being tested by Paine to see if he was worthy to steal Lee Industries' Hypersonic Stratojet, a jet that flies in the upper atmosphere at speeds exceeding mach 5. Aided by Flesh, Bogey acquired the Stratojet's launch codes and successfully stole the jet itself. Hawk and Axel were lucky enough to get on board the jet before it took off. When the Stratojet reached the upper atmosphere, it entered free-fall with no gravity. Bogey and Flesh would take on their two stowaways. Eventually Bogey was outsmarted by Hawk in battle while they were still in free-fall. With their mission failed and the Stratojet burning up on reentry Bogey and Flesh escaped in an escape pod. The Stratojet was damaged but landed without exploding thanks to Hawk and Axel while Bogey was stuck with a sick Flesh in the middle of the ocean. Bogey was arrested sometime later with Axel knowing of it. This implies that the Alpha Teens might have helped to put him there. When Hawk and King were unjustly arrested, Bogey was one of the villains to make their stay in prison very difficult. After King and Recombo started a food fight, he and the other villains imprisoned because of the Alpha Teens attacked King and Hawk. Bogey and Hawk were in an evenly matched fight until the prison guards scared Bogey off. Bogey's ego can rival Hawk's and they both are talented pilots. However, Hawk cares about the well being of the innocent while Bogey cares about winning and succeeding at any cost. Also, Hawk is not the type to leave a crashing plane unless he has no other choice, Bogey has no problems with doing that himself. Optical Optical (voiced by Jess Harnell) is a special effects specialist, whose holographic imaging system can change his appearance for short periods of time. He only needs to impersonate a person's voice or actions to impersonate them. He also can copy their retinal scans if he scans their eyes with the blinding light coming out of his mechanical eye. He was hired by Paine to frame Axel for an armored car robbery and keeping the real Axel distracted by pretending to be his supposedly deceased father, Sebastian. Even though the Alpha Teens discovered Optical's ruse, the police were able to track Axel down and arrest him. The next part of Optical's mission was to help Paine steal plutonium from Landmark City's nuclear power plant. To do this he gave holographic imaging systems to Paine, Spydah and Flesh and they pretended to be the other four Alpha Teen members. With optical scans he stole from the rest of the team, Optical along with Paine's gang gained access the Mechcavateors, giant robots mechs used for construction. With the Mechavateors, Paine would break into the power plant and steal the plutonium with ease. The real Alpha Teens, including Axel, who escaped from police custody, stopped Paine's plan by destroying the Mechcavators. Optical was the first one beaten and King arrested him while Paine and his gang escaped. When Hawk and King were unjustly arrested, Optical was one of the villains to make their stay in prison very difficult. In prison, Optical created a crude version of the holographic imaging system, which makes him able to walk around freely as a guard as opposed to being kept in a cell. In the cafeteria Optical posed as a cafeteria worker and spit in Hawk's food. After King and Recombo started a food fight, he and the other villains imprisoned because of the Alpha Teens attacked King and Hawk. Optical was defeated by Axel after he and Lioness came to breakout King and Hawk. Mass Vinnie \\"Mass\\" Rossi (voiced by Brian Cummings) was a two-bit extortionist who was strong enough to punch through brick. He rhymes most of what he says after his mom always said be unique. He was hired by Paine to enter a wrestling battle royal to win the WWC title belt so Paine can use the belt's diamonds for his new laser. Paine only went to Rossi after Flesh badly injured his leg because Paine overworked him. When Spydah suggested him, Paine implied that he was dumber than Flesh. When Paine approached Rossi about his offer, Rossi said that he'd think about it but Paine used his pain touch on him to force him to do it. In the battle royal, Rossi was one of only two participants left with the other being King. Despite his heelish actions, Rossi was tossed out of the ring by King losing the match. He was distracted by the attractive Lioness who was cheering for King. At the docks, Vinnie tried to apologize to Paine, but when he told him that he was in love, Paine angrily shoved Rossi in a mining car. Concrete was dumped on top of Rossi as Paine dropped him into the sea. Little did Paine know, there was radioactive waste near where Rossi had sunk to. The waste mutated Rossi into a giant mass of concrete with iron pipes sticking out of his shoulders. When Paine and Flesh went back to steal the belt, the now mutated Rossi followed them. Inside the vault where the belt was kept, Rossi, now wanting to be called Vinnie \\"The Mass\\" Rossi, interrupted a confrontation between Paine and Flesh and the Alpha Teens. He proved to be invulnerable to Paine's powers and Axel's Jo-Lan and stronger than Flesh and King. Mass takes the title belt, kidnaps Lioness and escapes. With the belt Mass intended to retire and then make Lioness his wife. When he went to see his momma, Paine and Flesh came to get the belt back. Paine fired on an unharmed Mass who was protecting his momma and Lioness. Paine threw his mother on a gurney and he chased after her losing the belt in the process. His mother saved, Mass asks Lioness to marry him. Though while she appreciated him sticking up for her from his mother's judgment and she thought his care with a baby he rescued was neat. All the same, Lioness told him she wasn't attracted to him due to his appearance. Deeply hurt and greatly angered, Mass turned on Lioness and in a fit of rage almost leveled the entire hospital. His attempt was halted by King, so Mass sought a rematch between the two. King was nearly defeated until Axel found some sleeping gas and threw it in Mass' mouth. Mass was knocked out and fell several stories down. Still sleeping, Mass was carted off to jail on a gurney. Sometime later during him being transferred to another prison, Mass was rescued by Spydah and Flesh. Paine needed him for an underground assignment, where his rock body won't be affected by the intense heat that regular humans can't handle. Mass initially refused, but with his mother captured by Paine, he reluctantly agreed. Flesh unintentionally told Mass that Paine was holding his mother next to their location. He breaks into Paine's lair and rescues his momma. He tells Lioness, who she and her team were there to stop Paine, that they weren't meant to last, completely over his feelings for her. Mass' momma tells him to get Paine. After reaching Paine, Paine tries to make with deal with him to still help him. Mass again objects but his momma says that they can rule Landmark City. He likes the sound of \\"Mayor Momma Rossi\\" so he decided to still help Paine. He was sent to take a bomb to a lava crater so he can blow it up and flood Landmark City with lava. Axel stopped him before he could do so and threw the bomb in a hole they were climbing out of. Axel made it out before the bomb went off, but Mass was caught in the explosion with some Lava from the crater engulfing him. The Mass was fused with the lava, but he survived. All he was concerned about was finding his momma. Even though he's a villain, Mass seemingly has some compassion and caring for others. There is no question that Mass is threatening, overly aggressive and easily angered, but he has shown how gentle he can be around women (his Momma and Lioness) and children (the baby he helped save). Mass full first name is also into question. Paine calls him Vincent and his Momma calls him Vincenzo. Momma Rossi Momma Rossi (voiced by Pat Musick) is the mother of Vinnie \\"The Mass\\" Rossi and the person who inspired him to be unique, hence the rhyming. She was at the event where her son was wrestling for the WWC title, but saw that he was looking at Lioness in the crowd instead of focusing on the match. When Vinnie became Mass, he brought Lioness to the hospital where she was staying and claimed that she was his future wife. Momma looked Lioness over and told him that there wasn't enough meat on her bones and that he could do better. Mass protected her and Lioness after Paine tried to kill them. Momma tried to protect Mass but Paine threw her on a gurney and she was flying down the hallways with Mass chasing after her. After Mass saved her, she helped save a baby from the fire Paine started in the hospital. When she returned, her \\"baby\\" was in a fight with King and she cheered him on, even knocking out Hawk when he was cheering King on. When Mass was knocked out by Axel, she said that she'd never forgive him (although asked if he wanted to date her daughter Victoria if he was single). Sometime later, she was kidnapped by Paine and used as a way to get Mass' cooperation in his newest plan. After both her son and the Alpha Teens break into Paine's lair, Mass frees her and they go after Paine. After Paine makes a deal with Mass, Momma Rossi saw them taking over Landmark City, with her as mayor and the deal was struck. With Mass on his mission, Paine tossed Momma Rossi in a trash bin, and effectively betraying her. After the Alpha Teens stopped Paine and Mass, a garbage truck delivered her to the Landmark City dump, head first in the trash. Bonez Bonez (voiced by Pete Sepenuk) is a scientist who was able to turn humans into zombies with a nano-virus and his skull mask. The zombies he created can also spread the nano-virus by biting someone. With the nano-virus he has these zombies under his control. He also carries an energy scythe as his weapon. A man with a disfigured face Bonez was considered an outcast in Landmark City. Seeking his revenge, Bonez leaves Landmark City and makes a home in the Underworld, the remains of the old Landmark City after a massive earthquake that is located under the new Landmark City that was built over it. After kidnapping people and stealing vehicles from all over the city making the people his zombies, Bonez left his green skull symbol where he hit. On Halloween night, the Alpha Teens were sent by Mr. Lee to investigate the disappearance of the Mecha Speeder, a vehicle made by his company. The Mecha Speeder was last seen on a boat called the Seaserpent, and both it and the ship's crew were taken by Bonez. The Alpha Teens find Underworld and Bonez when he captures Hawk. After Hawk and eventually Shark and Lioness were turned into zombies, Bonez planned to attack the Landmark City with his zombie army during the full moon. Axel and King discover that sunlight returns the zombies to normal and they fire at the concrete above letting sunlight into Underworld. Bonez faces Axel but Axel forces him back with his Jo-Lan. Bonez was caught in an explosion when his scythe cut through some of the energy weapons he had stored in his car. Bonez's remains are not found in the wreckage and he is later revealed to be alive. D-Zel D-Zel (voiced by Jess Harnell) is a lowlife street biker who dated Magness when she came back to Landmark City. When the two of them went to a night club, they got into an unexpected confrontation with the Alpha Teens sans Hawk (who was home \\"cooking\\"). He fought King until Spydah and Flesh forcefully took Magness to see Paine. He was knocked down by Spydah in a futile effort to rescue her. Magness leaves with Paine's Street Shredder and with D-Zel decide to get a new bike from Lee's R & D lab. Again unexpectedly, the two face off with the Alpha Teens. After facing Axel, both on Mr. Lee's new motorbikes, D-Zel and the bike are knocked down on a conveyor belt. D-Zel and the bike enter a machine that accidentally merged him with it. As a man-bike hybrid, D-Zel can stand straight like a man or go into bike mode and ride like a bike. He can also extend his left leg out for a far range kicking attack. After the accident, he and Magness escape, in a sense getting what they wanted. After Magness and D-Zel beat Paine to the punch on his plan and escaping from Paine, the Alpha Teens, and the police, Paine took the heat for the robbery. D-Zel was content for Paine getting the blame but Magness wanted credit for the heist. She finds out on TV that the Alpha Teens are temporarily located at Mr. Lee's San Solomon estate. With D-Zel and his biker buddies, Magness sought to take out the Alpha Teens once and for all. At San Solomon, D-Zel faced Axel on inside a giant maze garden. Axel tricked D-Zel into being engulfed by one of Lee's robot gardeners. He was trapped in a bale of cut grass and he and the other bikers were defeated and arrested. Magness, also defeated, was saved by and escaped with Spydah after she called Paine for help via her cellphone. D-Zel and his biker pals appeared again with Magness and helped her with a plot to smuggle some gold out of the city using the Rock band Body Hammer. They had melted and reformed the gold they stole into the Rock Band's robotic dancing machine in order to smuggle it out of the city. D-Zel was defeated and arrested by Axel. D-Zel returns in Season 2 with Magness and Spydah, only to be arrested once again. Boon and Fender Boon and Fender (voiced by Danny Mann and Maurice LaMarche respectively) were a police sergeant and court judge for Landmark City respectively. They both were being blackmailed by Paine for something that would cost them both their jobs. Boon was instructed to frame the Alpha Teens and Garrett for grand theft auto and arrest them. The Alpha Teens tried to escape after they figured out that they were corrupt, but King and Hawk were caught. Fender's job was to sentence them 30 years to hard labor and rid Paine of them for good. In a rescue attempt of Hawk and King, the Alpha Teens faked their deaths. The two met at a diner thinking that their problems were over. Hawk taped their confession, including Boon giving Paine the key to the evidence locker to recover a weapon he was going to use to kill graduating officers. While Fender warned Paine to strike, Boon attempted to slow them down. Boon crashed into a fountain when Hawk and Lioness used their T.A.G.blasters to pop his tires. With Hawk's video as evidence, both Boon and Fender were arrested. Terrance Yao Terrance Yao is a Hong Kong billionaire and tycoon for the global conglomerate, Yao Federated. He also secretly was the head of one of Hong Kong's criminal clans, including a group of ninjas. He sent these ninjas to Landmark City to steal the Sword of Jo-Lan, a sword that gives its wielder mystical powers. The ninjas mission was a success, but not without running into the Alpha Teens and Dragon. The Alpha Teens fly to Hong Kong to question Yao, after one of his company's helicopters was used. They questioned him but he states that the helicopter was stolen from him and he had nothing to do with the robbery. In actuality Yao wanted to use the sword to gain the supreme power of Jo-Lan during the eclipse of the sixth moon, which is an event that takes place once every 300 years. Yao would become invulnerable and invincible with enough power to rule the world. Yao tried to rid himself of his enemies before the eclipse but did not succeed. At the top of Yao Tower, Yao became stronger during the eclipse, but the ceremony was not yet over. This gave Axel and Dragon time to stop him. While most of their attacks were ineffective against Yao, Dragon and Axel were victorious after a last second attack by Dragon that disarmed Yao and the sword's safe recovery by Axel. With the Sword of Jo-Lan out of his hands and the ceremony over, Yao lost all the power he had gained. Axel gave the sword to Dragon for him to protect it and Yao was arrested by Hong Kong authorities. Before he was driven away by police, Yao promised vengeance against Axel sooner than he thinks. Hybridon Hybridon (voiced by Jeff Black) was a tiger cub that was experimented on by Recombo. It became a giant monstrous creature with added DNA of a cobra, hornet, rhinoceros and shark. It was initially discovered in Blue Pines National Park, which forced the park to close until wildlife experts could find and catch it. A giant pair of cast-iron shackles that Hybridon was wearing, before it chewed through them was found on the path from the park to Mr. Lee's San Solomon estate. The path itself is owned by Mr. Lee, suggesting that he aided Recombo to mutate the creature. None of this was made aware to the Alpha Teens who went camping in Blue Pines entering the park through the back way. Axel eventually finds out, but not before Hybridon smelled food at their campsite emitting from Shark and Hawk's tent. Hawk was knocked out by the beast when he went to investigate. It dragged the tent away with Shark still sleeping inside. It ate Shark's food and almost him too, but he was rescued by the rest of his team. Hybridon was defeated by Axel after he used a powerful weapon given to him by a park ranger. It was caged by the wildlife services the next morning. The name Hybridon comes from the action figure the creature is based on. Team Omega Team Omega is a group formed by Paine to stop the Alpha Teens for good. Tired of leaving this task to Spydah and Flesh, who almost always fail, Paine held tryouts at a rundown theater for new blood. Sadly, each audition was worse than the next. Paine decides to use contestants in the Ultimate Challenge Race, a competition the Alpha Teens were to take place in. The results were much more favorable and Paine had his team. Their objective was to permanently eliminate the Alpha Teens at the competition. After they thought they had got rid of the Alpha Teens, they helped Paine steal Nitro Alkalide and attempt to put it into an oil pipeline. They were defeated by the Alpha Teens after each member barely survived their last encounter with Team Omega. The five were arrested by police and Paine escaped. Their members include: * Edge - A punk rocker skateboarder with a cockney accent who fights with a raw and brutal style. His objective was to take out Axel in the skateboarding event. At the competition he threatens Axel and throws him off the track. Afterwards he was the most interested in getting paid, unaware that they were going to double their pay by helping Paine at the pipeline. He was later defeated by Axel and his Jo-Lan in battle. * Radman (voiced by Tom Kenny) - A motocross biker who had beady eyes and front teeth that looks similar to rat's teeth. His dirtbike is equipped with sawblades at the wheels. He was assigned to Lioness at the dirtbike event. During his race, Radman comes up from behind Lioness and uses his sawblades to slash her tires. Lioness soon loses control of her bike sending her over an embankment. When the Alpha Teens came back to stop Paine's plan, Radman attempted to attack Axel with a forklift. He was stopped by King and was knocked off the platform with one punch. * Buffy - A buff woman in overalls with attitude. She's strong enough to beat a super-strong Flesh in arm wrestling (although he used his giant pinky) knocking him on the floor in the process. She was put to task against King in the ATV jousting event. Buffy is easily beaten by King as she is forced off her ATV onto the ledge of the cliff they were on. She acted innocent and fragile so King would help her up. When King grabbed her hand to do this, Buffy pulled him over the cliff. At the area of the pipeline, Buffy tried to smash King with steel beams, from the crane she was operating. King escaped in time and Hawk flew in and grabbed Buffy out of the crane dropping her into the ocean. * Icarus (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating John Travolta) - A narcissistic areal expert with a Tony Manero accent. He has a jetpack that can go at incredible speeds. Icarus also has a pair of goggles that act like binoculars, a rope he can fire from his wrists and laser beams he can fire from his gloves. He was put ego to ego with Hawk in the jetpack capture the flag event. When Paine describes Hawk as \\"Idiotic and vain\\", Icraus says that he \\"...hates those types\\", quickly pulling out a can of hairspray and fixing his hair. During the competition, he slams Hawk into a turbine breaking his jetpack and uses his rope to toss Hawk off. At the pipeline, Icarus was in pursuit of Hawk, when Lioness stomped on his back in mid-air. He was knocked so low, he crashed into a stack of boxes on the platform. * Gator Girl - A surfer girl who has sharp shark-like teeth that can go through glass, metal and plastic and alligator scale tattoos all over her body (hence her nickname). She was selected to deal with Shark in the surfing event. With the competition underway, Gator Girl tries to take a chunk out of Shark, but he blocks her attack with his surfboard, which breaks in half. With no time to react, Shark plunges over a waterfall. At the pipeline, Paine needed her to bite a hole in it to put in the Nitro Alkalide. She did this but found Shark inside, and he leaped forward, knocking Gator Girl out. Supporting characters Garrett Garrett (voiced by Alexander Polinsky) is a super genius who works for Lee Industries. He enrolled in college at a young age having two semesters with Professor Evans in a course of sonic engineering and software application. Evans was also his research adviser. At thirteen, he received his college Ph. D and was hired by Mr. Lee that same year. Before the Alpha Team was formed, he developed Mr. Lee's vehicles and when he was of age, road tested them as well. When a turbo ATV that he constructed and test drove broke apart, he injured two people as well as himself. The other victims recovered, but Garrett was paralyzed from the waist down. Now a paraplegic, he is equipped with a technologically advanced wheelchair that can extend its height and climb on walls and ceilings. Garrett was guilt ridden after the accident, refusing to drive another vehicle again. Axel and the others helped show how invaluable he was and how he needed to get over the past. While he still developed new vehicles for the company, he started modifying the Alpha Teens existing vehicles and gear as well as inventing new ones. After Lee was forced out of his company, Garrett stayed with Lee Industries and still proving to be a great asset to the team. Col. Richter Colonel Richter (voiced by Jess Harnell) is a special agent with Landmark City's law enforcement. He firsts crosses paths with the Alpha Teens when he believes that they have become criminals. When it is revealed that it was the shape changing Optical along with Paine's gang who set them up, Richter dropped the charges against them. He would later help them capture Team Omega as well as a corrupt cop and corrupt judge that worked for Paine. During Richter's attempt to catch Paine, Axel and his team interrupted it taking it upon themselves to stop him. After Paine escapes, Richter and Axel (who tries to capture Paine on the anniversary of his dad's death) go at each other's throats. When Axel captures Paine a day later, Richter still doesn't approve of Axel's methods, but is relieved that Paine is going back to prison. Eliza Eliza is Lioness's cousin; she is skilled in capoeira and is an engineering expert. The two cousins grew up together in Brazil and are close. Eliza didn't think that Lioness respected her. With her assistance, Garrett and the Alpha Teens defeated Paine from destroying Landmark City. She also saved Lioness from Spydah. Lioness offered Eliza the opportunity to live with the team. She declined, wanting to set her own path in life and not following Lioness' anymore. She was given a job with Lee Industries working on projects for Mr. Lee in South America. Shark and Hawk both liked her and fought over her. She decided that she liked Garrett the most, whom she went on her first date with before she left. Duke Duke Kingston is King's twelve-year-old brother who is enrolled in the Landmark City School for the Gifted, of which he has the highest IQ. During King's wrestling coaching at his school with Axel, King was mothering Duke, asking him if he took his asthma medication and not letting him be a volunteer for some of King's moves. When King, Axel and Hawk left the school, Mr. Lee and the Mu-Team made their move. Lee hooked Duke and his classmates to a machine that drained the brain power from his classmates. transferring it into Duke. Duke became smarter than fifty Albert Einsteins and has ability to use telekinetic powers fifty times more powerful than the very small latent ability each human has. This process also turned Duke and the other students evil. This new evil side effect made Duke bitter at King for embarrassing him in front of his class. He escapes with Lee and the Mu-Team back to his base. Lee needed an ultra-genius to help him create a working vehicle out of the hard light. To make it work, they needed a special type of crystalline moon rock from the Landmark City Observatory. At the observatory, Duke, Lee and the Mu-Team face off against the Alpha Teens. When Lee gets the moon rock he needed and he was able to form his hard light vehicle, he betrays Duke, because the Mu-Team started to get jealous of his genius. Lee tries to use his new vehicle to run over Duke, but he uses his telekinesis to throw the vehicle into a pillar. Lee and the Mu-Team escape, but Duke is hit by the pillar and is knocked out cold. Garrett reversed what Lee had done to Duke and the other students and Duke are shown to be unharmed. Sebastian Manning Sebastian Manning (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is the father of Axel Manning and a master of Jo-Lan. He also was a covert ops spy for the government, who worked closely with Alexander Paine and Janus Lee. When Axel recovered his father's diary, he found out that Lee was trading the government's project secrets for tons of money. Then the government reported that someone was giving the secrets to someone else. Sebastian went undercover and caught Lee. Lee told him the truth, saying that it was the owner of the \\"Serpent's Tail\\" a.k.a. Dragon's master. Paine and Manning went into the nuclear room to fight him, however, Dragon's master was equipped with a bomb. The bomb went off, and only Paine escaped alive albeit with his body scarred. Sebastian's body never appeared and he was labeled dead as a result. Dragon's master says that Sebastian Manning is still alive. Throughout the show, Axel has dreams and memories of his father, most of them involve their Jo-Lan training together. Dragon also shares a connection with Axel's father, being that he knows who he is and knowledgeable and at least one Jo-Lan attack that only Manning knew. Eventually it was revealed that Dragon was actually a clone of Manning. Though many, including Axel and Paine, think that he's dead, there is no real clear answer if he is, or if he's alive. Michelle Moreno Michelle Moreno is a news reporter for LIITV news. She first appeared when Outworld Park was being flooded by Paine. Then she appeared talking to Mr. Lee about the transport of Neutronium during a protest. She makes a quick cameo, when Lioness saves a baby from a burning building. She reported on the Anti- Establishment Ultra Challenge Race. She reported on a bank heist that the villains Magness and D-Zel pulled off but Paine got the credit for. In an episode where she meets the Alpha Teens, she reported on a meteorite that caused a blackout in Landmark City. While she still worked on that story, Hawk got her interested in doing a piece about him testing the Hypersonic Stratojet, with him as leader of the Alpha Teens. When Paine took the meteorite, she tipped off the team to his plan to black out the city again and his location, Angel Peak quarry. Michelle accompanied the Alpha Teens, telling them that it is the biggest story she ever had. While the others fought and defeated Paine, she stayed with Hawk in the Stratojet. When a brief EMP burst hit the jet, Michelle wanted to eject, but Hawk was determined not to crash it. Unlike the first time the Emp hit, this time Hawk succeeded, pulling the jet out of its nosedive at the last second. Although they did not crash, Hawk's actions left her with the impression that Hawk was a \\"psychotic weirdo\\". Female Doctor The Female Doctor is a doctor with brunette hair that has made a few appearances in the show. Her real name is unknown. She first appeared as Axel's dentist that shifted her attention to Hawk when he interrupted their session. She then appeared as the doctor for the ski resort on Iron Mountain who was kidnapped and replaced by Magness. She was saved by Lioness and Hawk later in that episode. Her most recent and important appearance was tending to and helping to detox Axel after Paine's men infected him with venom from a very toxic water spider. A.T.O.M. A.T.O.M.

Printing typically uses common printing equipment suitable for defining patterns on material, such as screen printing, flexography, gravure, offset lithography, and inkjet. By electronic industry standards, these are low cost processes. Electrically functional electronic or optical inks are deposited on the substrate, creating active or passive devices, such as thin film transistors; capacitors; coils; resistors. Printed electronics is expected to facilitate widespread, very low-cost, low-performance electronics for applications such as flexible displays, smart labels, decorative and animated posters, and active clothing that do not require high performance. Coatan√©a, E., Kantola, V., Kulovesi, J., Lahti, L., Lin, R., & Zavodchikova, M. (2009). Printed Electronics, Now and Future. In Neuvo, Y., & Yl√∂nen, S. (eds.), Bit Bang ‚Äì Rays to the Future. Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), MIDE, Helsinki University Print, Helsinki, Finland, 63-102. . http://lib.tkk.fi/Reports/2009/isbn9789522480781.pdf The term printed electronics is often related to organic electronics or plastic electronics, in which one or more inks are composed of carbon-based compounds. These other terms refer to the ink material, which can be deposited by solution-based, vacuum-based or other processes. Printed electronics, in contrast, specifies the process, and, subject to the specific requirements of the printing process selected, can utilize any solution-based material. This includes organic semiconductors, inorganic semiconductors, metallic conductors, nanoparticles, and nanotubes. For the preparation of printed electronics nearly all industrial printing methods are employed. Similar to conventional printing, printed electronics applies ink layers one atop another. So the coherent development of printing methods and ink materials are the field's essential tasks. The most important benefit of printing is low-cost volume fabrication. The lower cost enables use in more applications. An example is RFID-systems, which enable contactless identification in trade and transport. In some domains, such as light-emitting diodes printing does not impact performance. Printing on flexible substrates allows electronics to be placed on curved surfaces, for example, printing solar cells on vehicle roofs. More typically, conventional semiconductors justify their much higher costs by providing much higher performance. Printed and conventional electronics as complementary technologies. Resolution, registration, thickness, holes, materials The maximum required resolution of structures in conventional printing is determined by the human eye. Feature sizes smaller than approximately 20 ¬µm cannot be distinguished by the human eye and consequently exceed the capabilities of conventional printing processes. A. Blayo and B. Pineaux, Joint sOC-EUSAI Conference, Grenoble, 2005. In contrast, higher resolution and smaller structures are necessary in much electronics printing, because they directly affect circuit density and functionality (especially transistors). A similar requirement holds for the precision with which layers are printed on top of each other (layer to layer registration). Control of thickness, holes, and material compatibility (wetting, adhesion, solubility) are essential, but matter in conventional printing only if the eye can detect them. Conversely, the visual impression is irrelevant for printed electronics.U. F√ºgmann et al., mstNews 2 (2006) 13. Printing technologies The attraction of printing technology for the fabrication of electronics mainly results from the possibility of preparing stacks of micro-structured layers (and thereby thin- film devices) in a much simpler and cost-effective way compared to conventional electronics.J. R. Sheats, Journal of Materials Research 2004; 19 1974. Also, the ability to implement new or improved functionalities (e.g. mechanical flexibility) plays a role. The selection of the printing method used is determined by requirements concerning printed layers, by the properties of printed materials as well as economic and technical considerations of the final printed products. Printing technologies divide between sheet-based and roll-to-roll-based approaches. Sheet-based inkjet and screen printing are best for low-volume, high-precision work. Gravure, offset and flexographic printing are more common for high-volume production, such as solar cells, reaching 10.000 square meters per hour (m¬≤/h). While offset and flexographic printing are mainly used for inorganicJ. Siden et al., Polytronic Conference, Wroclaw, 2005. and organic conductors (the latter also for dielectrics), gravure printing is especially suitable for quality-sensitive layers like organic semiconductors and semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces in transistors, due to high layer quality. If high resolution is needed, gravure is also suitable for inorganicS. Leppavuori et al., Sensors and Actuators 41-42 (1994) 593. and organic conductors. Organic field-effect transistors and integrated circuits can be prepared completely by means of mass-printing methods. Inkjet printing Inkjets are flexible and versatile, and can be set up with relatively low effort. However, inkjets offer lower throughput of around 100 m2/h and lower resolution (ca. 50 ¬µm). It is well suited for low- viscosity, soluble materials like organic semiconductors. With high-viscosity materials, like organic dielectrics, and dispersed particles, like inorganic metal inks, difficulties due to nozzle clogging occur. Because ink is deposited via droplets, thickness and dispersion homogeneity is reduced. Using many nozzles simultaneously and pre-structuring the substrate allows improvements in productivity and resolution, respectively. However, in the latter case non-printing methods must be employed for the actual patterning step. Inkjet printing is preferable for organic semiconductors in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), but also OFETs completely prepared by this method have been demonstrated. Frontplanes S. Holdcroft, Advanced Materials 2001; 13 1753. and backplanes of OLED-displays, integrated circuits, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs) V.G. Shah and D.B. Wallace, IMAPS Conference, Long Beach, 2004. and other devices can be prepared with inkjets. Screen printing Screen printing is appropriate for fabricating electrics and electronics due to its ability to produce patterned, thick layers from paste-like materials. This method can produce conducting lines from inorganic materials (e.g. for circuit boards and antennas), but also insulating and passivating layers, whereby layer thickness is more important than high resolution. Its 50 m¬≤/h throughput and 100 ¬µm resolution are similar to inkjets. This versatile and comparatively simple method is used mainly for conductive and dielectric layers, but also organic semiconductors, e.g. for OPVCs, and even complete OFETs can be printed. Aerosol jet printing Aerosol Jet Printing (also known as Maskless Mesoscale Materials Deposition or M3D)M. Renn, US Patent number 7,485,345 B2. Page 3. is another material deposition technology for printed electronics. The Aerosol Jet process begins with atomization of an ink, via ultrasonic or pneumatic means, producing droplets on the order of one to two micrometres in diameter. The droplets then flow through a virtual impactor which deflects the droplets having lower momentum away from the stream. This step helps maintaining a tight droplet size distribution. The droplets are entrained in a gas stream and delivered to the print head. Here, an annular flow of clean gas is introduced around the aerosol stream to focus the droplets into a tightly collimated beam of material. The combined gas streams exit the print head through a converging nozzle that compresses the aerosol stream to a diameter as small as 10 ¬µm. The jet of droplets exits the print head at high velocity (~50 meters/second) and impinges upon the substrate. Electrical interconnects, passive and active componentsJ.H. Cho et al, Nature Materials, 19 October 2008. are formed by moving the print head, equipped with a mechanical stop/start shutter, relative to the substrate. The resulting patterns can have features ranging from 10 ¬µm wide, with layer thicknesses from tens of nanometers to >10 ¬µm.B. Kahn, Organic and Printed Electronics, Volume 1, Issue 2 (2007). A wide nozzle print head enables efficient patterning of millimeter size electronic features and surface coating applications. All printing occurs without the use of vacuum or pressure chambers. The high exit velocity of the jet enables a relatively large separation between the print head and the substrate, typically 2‚Äì5 mm. The droplets remain tightly focused over this distance, resulting in the ability to print conformal patterns over three dimensional substrates. Despite the high velocity, the printing process is gentle; substrate damage does not occur and there is generally minimal splatter or overspray from the droplets.B. H. King et al, Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), 2009 34th IEEE. Once patterning is complete, the printed ink typically requires post treatment to attain final electrical and mechanical properties. Post-treatment is driven more by the specific ink and substrate combination than by the printing process. A wide range of materials has been successfully deposited with the Aerosol Jet process, including diluted thick film pastes, nanoparticle inks, thermosetting polymers such as UV-curable epoxies, and solvent-based polymers like polyurethane and polyimide, and biologic materials.Ingo Grunwald et al, 2010 Biofabrication 2 014106. Recently, printing paper was proposed to be used as the substrate of the printing. Highly conductive (close to bulk copper) and high-resolution traces can be printed on foldable and available office printing papers, with 80¬∞Celsius curing temperature and 40 minutes of curing time . Evaporation printing Evaporation printing uses a combination of high precision screen printing with material vaporization to print features to 5 ¬µm. This method uses techniques such as thermal, e-beam, sputter and other traditional production technologies to deposit materials through a high precision shadow mask (or stencil) that is registered to the substrate to better than 1 micrometer. By layering different mask designs and/or adjusting materials, reliable, cost-effective circuits can be built additively, without the use of photo-lithography. Other methods Other methods with similarities to printing, among them microcontact printing and nano-imprint lithography are of interest. Here, ¬µm- and nm-sized layers, respectively, are prepared by methods similar to stamping with soft and hard forms, respectively. Often the actual structures are prepared subtractively, e.g. by deposition of etch masks or by lift-off processes. For example, electrodes for OFETs can be prepared. Sporadically pad printing is used in a similar manner. Occasionally so-called transfer methods, where solid layers are transferred from a carrier to the substrate, are considered printed electronics. Electrophotography is currently not used in printed electronics. Materials Both organic and inorganic materials are used for printed electronics. Ink materials must be available in liquid form, for solution, dispersion or suspension. Z. Bao, Advanced Materials 2000; 12: 227. They must function as conductors, semiconductors, dielectrics, or insulators. Material costs must be fit for the application. Electronic functionality and printability can interfere with each other, mandating careful optimization. For example, a higher molecular weight in polymers enhances conductivity, but diminishes solubility. For printing, viscosity, surface tension and solid content must be tightly controlled. Cross-layer interactions such as wetting, adhesion, and solubility as well as post-deposition drying procedures affect the outcome. Additives often used in conventional printing inks are unavailable, because they often defeat electronic functionality. Material properties largely determine the differences between printed and conventional electronics. Printable materials provide decisive advantages beside printability, such as mechanical flexibility and functional adjustment by chemical modification (e.g. light color in OLEDs). Printed conductors offer lower conductivity and charge carrier mobility. With a few exceptions, inorganic ink materials are dispersions of metallic or semiconducting micro- and nano-particles. Semiconducting nanoparticles used include silicon and oxide semiconductors. Silicon is also printed as an organic precursor which is then converted by pyrolisis and annealing into crystalline silicon. PMOS but not CMOS is possible in printed electronics. Organic materials Organic printed electronics integrates knowledge and developments from printing, electronics, chemistry, and materials science, especially from organic and polymer chemistry. Organic materials in part differ from conventional electronics in terms of structure, operation and functionality, which influences device and circuit design and optimization as well as fabrication method.H. Kempa et al., it 3 (2008) 167. The discovery of conjugated polymers http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/chemadv.pdf Nobel prize in chemistry, 2000 and their development into soluble materials provided the first organic ink materials. Materials from this class of polymers variously possess conducting, semiconducting, electroluminescent, photovoltaic and other properties. Other polymers are used mostly as insulators and dielectrics. In most organic materials, hole transport is favored over electron transport. Recent studies indicate that this is a specific feature of organic semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces, which play a major role in OFETs. Therefore, p-type devices should dominate over n-type devices. Durability (resistance to dispersion) and lifetime is less than conventional materials. Organic semiconductors include the conductive polymers poly(3,4-ethylene dioxitiophene), doped with poly(styrene sulfonate), (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(aniline) (PANI). Both polymers are commercially available in different formulations and have been printed using inkjet, screen and offset printing or screen, flexo and gravure printing, respectively. Polymer semiconductors are processed using inkjet printing, such as poly(thiopene)s like poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene co-bithiophen) (F8T2). The latter material has also been gravure printed. Different electroluminescent polymers are used with inkjet printing, as well as active materials for photovoltaics (e.g. blends of P3HT with fullerene derivatives), which in part also can be deposited using screen printing (e.g. blends of poly(phenylene vinylene) with fullerene derivatives). Printable organic and inorganic insulators and dielectrics exist, which can be processed with different printing methods. Inorganic materials Inorganic electronics provides highly ordered layers and interfaces that organic and polymer materials cannot provide. Silver nanoparticles are used with flexo, offset and inkjet. Gold particles are used with inkjet. A.C. electroluminescent (EL) multi-color displays can cover many tens of square meters, or be incorporated in watch faces and instrument displays. They involve six to eight printed inorganic layers, including a copper doped phosphor, on a plastic film substrate. Mflex UK (formerly Pelikon) and elumin8, both in the UK, Emirates Technical Innovation Centre in Dubai, Schreiner in Germany and others are involved in EL displays. Spectrolab already offers commercially flexible solar cells based on various inorganic compounds. CIGS cells can be printed directly onto molybdenum coated glass sheets. A printed gallium arsenide germanium solar cell demonstrated 40.7% conversion efficiency, eight times that of the best organic cells, approaching the best performance of crystalline silicon. Substrates Printed electronics allows the use of flexible substrates, which lowers production costs and allows fabrication of mechanically flexible circuits. While inkjet and screen printing typically imprint rigid substrates like glass and silicon, mass-printing methods nearly exclusively use flexible foil and paper. Poly(ethylene terephthalate)-foil (PET) is a common choice, due to its low cost and moderately high temperature stability. Poly(ethylene naphthalate)- (PEN) and poly(imide)-foil (PI) are higher performance, higher cost alternatives. Paper's low costs and manifold applications make it an attractive substrate, however, its high roughness and high wettability have traditionally made it problematic for electronics. This is an active research area, however, and print-compatible metal deposition techniques have been demonstrated that adapt to the rough 3D surface geometry of paper. Other important substrate criteria are low roughness and suitable wet-ability, which can be tuned pre-treatment by use of coating or Corona discharge. In contrast to conventional printing, high absorbency is usually disadvantageous. History Albert Hanson, a German by birth, is credited to have introduced the concept of printed electronics. in 1903 he filled a patent for ‚ÄúPrinted Wires,‚Äù and thus printed electronics were born. Hanson proposed forming a Printed Circuit Board pattern on copper foil through cutting or stamping. The drawn elements were glued to the dielectric, in this case, paraffined paper. The first printed circuit was produced in 1936 by Paul Eisler, and that process was used for large-scale production of radios by the USA during World War II. Printed circuit technology was released for commercial use in the USA in 1948 (Printed Circuits Handbook, 1995). In the over a half-century since its inception, printed electronics has evolved from the production of printed circuit boards (PCBs), through the everyday use of membrane switches, to today‚Äôs RFID, photovoltaic and electroluminescent technologies. Today it is nearly impossible to look around a modern American household and not see devices that either uses printed electronic components or that are the direct result of printed electronic technologies. Widespread production of printed electronics for household use began in the 1960s when the Printed Circuit Board became the foundation for all consumer electronics. Since then printed electronics have become a cornerstone in many new commercial products. The biggest trend in recent history when it comes to printed electronics is the widespread use of them in solar cells. In 2011, researchers from MIT created a flexible solar cell by inkjet printing on normal paper. In 2018, researchers at Rice University have developed organic solar cells which can be painted or printed onto surfaces. These solar cells have been shown to max out at fifteen percent efficiency. Konarka Technologies, now a defunct company in the US, was the pioneering company in producing inkjet solar cells. Today there are more than fifty companies across a diverse number of countries that are producing printed solar cells. While printed electronics have been around since the 1960s, they are predicted to have a major boom in total revenue. As of 2011, the total printed electronic revenue was reported to be at $12.385 (billion). A report by IDTechEx predicts the PE market will reach $330 (billion) in 2027. A big reason for this increase in revenue is because of the incorporation of printed electronic into cellphones. Nokia was one of the companies that pioneered the idea of creating a ‚ÄúMorph‚Äù phone using printed electronics. Since then, Apple has implemented this technology into their iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR devices. Printed electronics can be used to make all of the following components of a cellphone: 3D main antenna, GPS antenna, energy storage, 3D interconnections, multi-layer PCB, edge circuits, ITO jumpers, hermetic seals, LED packaging, and tactile feedback. With the revolutionary discoveries and advantages that printed electronic gives to companies many large companies have made recent investments into this technology. In 2007, Soligie Inc. and Thinfilm Electronics entered into an agreement to combine IPs for soluble memory materials and functional materials printing to develop printed memory in commercial volumes. LG announce significant investment, potentially $8.71 billion in OLEDs on Plastic. Sharp (Foxconn) will invest $570m in pilot line for OLED displays. BOE announce potential $6.8 billion in flexible AMOLED fab. Heliatek has secured ‚Ç¨80m in additional funding for OPV manufacturing in Dresden. PragmatIC has raised ~ ‚Ç¨20m from investors including Avery Dennison. Thinfilm invests in new production site in Silicon Valley (formerly owned by Qualcomm).

Chaudhary was named 2004 Alumni of the Year for the University of Minnesota Law School. Minnesota House of Representatives Just two weeks out of law school, Chaudhary ran for the Minnesota House of Representatives in the July 1995 special election for the District 52A legislative seat, in a Minneapolis suburban area that includes parts of Fridley and New Brighton and all of Columbia Heights and Hilltop. Chaudhary lost the race, but later defeated the winner, Republican incumbent Skip Carlson in a 1996 rematch. At the time he was elected, Chaudhary became the first Asian-American member of the Minnesota Legislature, and the fourth Indian-American elected to a state legislature in U.S. history. While in the House, Chaudhary made contributed to legislation on healthcare access, education and economic development priorities. During this period of Chaudhary's legislative career, he was a member of the Minnesota Conservation Federation,Candidate Profile STAR Tribune - November 7, 2006 the Columbia Heights Lions Club, the Fridley Kiwanis, and became a member of the Fridley Human Resources Commission. Chaudhary was re-elected to the House in 1998. During his second term in office, he continued to work on environmental legislation and financial reform of the Minnesota State Lottery. He also became a member of the Police Officers Alliance of Minnesota. Minnesota Senate In 2000, incumbent Senator Steve Novak resigned to run for Minnesota's 4th congressional district. Chaudhary received the nomination from the local Minnesota Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party chapter and ran against Republican Daniel Coughlin in the November general election. Chaudhary won the election with 57 percent of the votes. When he joined the Senate at age 31, Satveer Chaudhary was the youngest senator ever elected in Minnesota, and became the first Asian-Indian state senator in American history.

Later that year, he escorted the Dalai Lama during his State visit to Minnesota. Due to the 2000 Census and redistricting, Chaudhary's first Minnesota senate term was two years. In 2002, he ran for a four-year term in the newly-redistricted SD-52 against Republican Steve Minar. Chaudhary won the election with 55.5 percent of the vote.election results.htm During his next term, Chaudhary served on new Senate committees focusing on the environment, tHe also assumed a leadership position within the Senate as Senate Majority Whip. As Vice Chair of the Fish and Game Subcommittee, Chaudhary was the Chief Author of the 2005 Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources reform bill, and co-authored legislation on clean air and water.Senator Chaudhary appointed to new legislative commission - Minnesota State SenateSenator of Indian origin files for re-election Hindustan Times - July 21, 2006 In 2006, because of his work with the environmental legislations, citizen's groups and outdoors organizations, Chaudhary was appointed by Senate Majority Leader, Dean Johnson to serve on the newly-created Legislative and Citizen‚Äôs Commission on Minnesota Resources. In 2006, Chaudhary ran again for the SD-50 senate seat against Republican Rae Hart Anderson. He was re-elected with 63% of the vote. In 2010, after political controversies, Chaudhary lost the DFL endorsement for the SD-50 senate seat. He lost in the primary to DFL-endorsed former representative Barb Goodwin with 30.9 percent of the vote. Controversies In 2002, a Republican political challenger of Chaudhary filed a complaint with the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board against the \\"Friends of Satveer Chaudhary Committee\\". The complaint alleged that the campaign committee failed to report some contributions and expenditures on the committee‚Äôs Report of Receipts and Expenditures for 2000. Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the committee failed to report expenditures for mailings in 2000. All allegations against the \\"Friends of Satveer Chaudhary Committee\\" were dismissed by the board, but the matter was referred to the Ramsey County Attorney. The Ramsey County Attorney chose not to pursue the matter. On April 25, 2006, the Saint Paul Police Department investigated a death threat made against the senator. Chaudhary, who had just voted against a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage, had received a letter containing a picture of himself with a bullet hole through his forehead. The picture was attached to a newspaper ad run promoting the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and civil unions. In a media statement, Chaudhary denounced the letter as political hate speech. The group that ran the ad, Minnesota Citizens in Defense of Marriage, condemned the letter and said it did not condone threats of violence. During the 2010 Session of the Minnesota Legislature, Saint Louis County Commissioner, Dennis Fink, asked Chaudhary to insert a provision into a fish and game bill that would place special fishing regulations Fish Lake in northern Minnesota. The Chaudhary family owns a cabin on leased land on part of the lake. The Senator then approached Representative David Dill on the House floor, and requested that he insert the language into the bill. After the close of session, Republicans in the Senate raised a question as to the appropriateness of Chaudhary's change to the legislation. In response, Senator Chaudhary requested that the Senate Ethics Panel provide an independent review of the situation, even though no complaint had been filed against him. On June 2, 2010, after finding that Chaudhary had no conflict of interest in introducing the legislation, the Minnesota Senate Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct admonished Chaudhary for the manner in which he introduced the legislation and for violating procedure.Politics in Minnesota In May 2010, the Senate District 50 DFL Party leadership decided to hold a meeting in June 2010 to discuss revocation of Chaudhary's DFL endorsement due to Chaudhary's endorsement of DFL gubernatorial candidate Mark Dayton over the DFL-endorsed candidate Margaret Anderson Kelliher and the Fish Lake issue. On June 1, 2010 former State Representative Barbara Goodwin filed for office as a DFL candidate against Chaudhary in the Minnesota primary election to be held on August 10, 2010. On July 8, 2010 the Duluth News Tribune reported that Chaudhary and his wife owed the IRS $252,000 in past-due personal income taxes: $100,000 for 2007 and $151,000 for 2008. In response, Chaudhary acknowledged that there was an existing payment plan with the IRS, and that the actual amount owed had just been determined in late 2009. Chaudhary stated the debt had been incurred due to a stock option issue with his wife's former employer. On August 1, 2010 it was announced that the family had paid the taxes in full. On June 28, 2010, the Senate District 50 DFL Central Committee voted by over two-thirds to revoke their endorsement of Chaudhary and instead endorsed Barbara Goodwin as the new candidate for Minnesota Senate. Chaudhary appealed the Senate District Committee's decision to a special panel of the State DFL Party. On July 11, 2010, the special panel of the Minnesota DFL Party unanimously upheld the revocation of Chaudhary's endorsement. Chaudhary still chose to proceed to the Minnesota primary election as an unendorsed DFL candidate. On August 10, 2010, Chaudhary was defeated in the primary. In November 2010, Barbara Goodwin defeated New Brighton City Council member, Gina Bauman, to win the District 50 Senate seat. After Chaudhary's defeat, he announced that he would return to private law practice full-time.

It is west of Glacier National Park in the Flathead National Forest, from the town of Whitefish and north of Kalispell.  Lifts and trails  The area currently has eleven chairlifts: three high-speed detachable quads and six fixed grip (two quads and four triples). There are also three surface lifts: two T-bars and a magic carpet. Of these, nine lifts operate regularly, including one T-bar which is normally only open on weekends. The mountain is separated into three faces. The front side is primarily serviced by the Big Mountain Express high speed quad and has the most skiable terrain. A second high speed quad, the Swift Creek Express (formerly the Glacier Chaser), services beginner and intermediate terrain. The front side has seven of the mountain's eleven chairlifts. The back side of the mountain is serviced by the Big Creek Express, also a high speed quad. The back side has more tree skiing terrain, and additional terrain can be accessed by T-Bar 2 on weekends and during select holiday periods, as well as Flower Point (a used triple chairlift acquired from Kimberley Resort in British Columbia), and East Rim (a triple chairlift relocated from the Glacier View alignment), which services the eastern front side and East Rim. The western aspect of the mountain contains the Hell Roaring basin. Serviced by Hellroaring (a triple chairlift), Hell Roaring basin is the most advanced skiing on the mountain with cliffs, vertical chutes, and tight tree skiing. The intermediate Hellfire trail is the longest on the mountain; it runs from the summit to the base of Chair 8. On some days the clouds at Whitefish Mountain Resort are low enough that skiers can literally ski above the clouds. The vertical drop of the ski area is , with a summit elevation of and a base of . The average annual snowfall is . The ski area is about north of Glacier Park International Airport and south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border. History Winter Sports, Inc. (WSI) formed in 1947 as a public company of community shareholders, opened The Big Mountain that It hosted the U.S. Alpine Championships in early March 1949, where future Olympic champion Andrea Mead of Vermont won all three women's titles at age sixteen. The mountain originally had a single T-bar, which was replaced by chairlifts installed in 1960, and 1968. After sixty years, it was renamed \\"Whitefish Mountain Resort\\" by then the ski area had expanded to include ten chairlifts. Olympic champion Tommy Moe learned to ski and race at the mountain, where his father was on the ski patrol. Moe won the gold medal in the and silver in the at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The mountain again hosted the U.S. Alpine Championships in 2001. That event is remembered for the failed comeback attempt, and life-altering crash, of 1984 Olympic downhill champion Bill Johnson. In May 2004, WSI conducted a 150-for-one reverse stock split. Its stated purpose was to lower expense by reducing the number of shareholders to below the threshold that imposed public reporting requirements. At the time the transaction was proposed, 664 shareholders, or 72% of investors in the company, each separately held less than 150 shares. In total, these investors held a 2.5% equity (and voting) stake. The board expressed concern that the transaction might be viewed as coercive, but after review and outside consultation decided the transaction was fair to the affected shareholders. In December 2006, WSI conducted a 15-for-one reverse stock split, further reducing to about 50 remaining shareholders in order to provide a tax advantage as a Subchapter S corporation. Again, all shareholders without enough shares to exchange for a post split share were required to cash-out their stock. WSI's handling of the reverse split was criticized and resulted in animosity within the local community, where there were objections to the timing of the related announcements and the loss of a community connection to the resort by the In early 2008, an avalanche occurred in the Flathead National Forest, within hiking distance of the back side of The Big Mountain and killed two skiers on Later that year, the resort discontinued summer lift access for winter season pass holders, granting several free lift tickets In September of that same year, the resort reversed the decision and announced that 2008‚Äì09 winter season passes would again convey unlimited foot-passenger lift access for References External links  YouTube - 1949 U.S. Alpine Championships - men's downhill Category:Buildings and structures in Flathead County, Montana Category:Ski areas and resorts in Montana Category:Tourist attractions in Flathead County, Montana ","title":"Whitefish Mountain Resort"},{"id":"8054695","title":"List of Power Rangers Turbo episodes"},{"id":"8054701","text":"Current ferry Previous Dartmouth Higher Ferry The Dartmouth Higher Ferry, also known as the Dartmouth‚ÄìKingswear Floating Bridge, is a vehicular cable ferry which crosses the River Dart in the English county of Devon. It is one of three ferries that cross the tidal river from Dartmouth to Kingswear, the others being the Lower Ferry and the Passenger Ferry. Unlike the Lower Ferry, which operates from slips in the centres of both Dartmouth and Kingswear, the Higher Ferry crosses to the north. In doing so, it allows the A379 road between Kingsbridge and Torbay to bypass the narrow streets in the centre of Kingswear and Dartmouth. The eastern ferry slip of the Higher Ferry is immediately adjacent to the Britannia Crossing, a level crossing across the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway. All vehicles entering or leaving the ferry must cross this crossing. The ferry is owned and operated by the Dartmouth‚ÄìKingswear Floating Bridge Company, and a toll is charged. The previous ferry boat, named No. 7, was built in 1960 and could carry up to 18 cars. Unusually, although it used cables for guidance, it was actually propelled by paddle wheels, a characteristic it shared with the Bac du Sauvage in France. Early in 2008, the Dartmouth‚ÄìKingswear Floating Bridge Company signed a contract for the construction of a replacement ferry. This ferry, which can carry up to 36 cars, came into service in late June 2009. Unlike the previous ferry, the new ferry is a more conventional cable ferry, using the cables for propulsion as well as guidance. However, it is also provided with four thrusters, one positioned at each corner, in order to provide additional manoeuvrability when operating in strong winds and tidal conditions. History The Floating Bridge was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1830.Dartmouth Floating Bridge Act 1830 (11 Geo. 4 & 1 Will. 4 c. cxxvii) Because it was making a loss it was suspended in 1855 but reinstated the following year with a new ferry. It was steam powered from 1831 to 1835 but then worked by hand or horses until 1867 when a steam engine again powered the ferry. It was closed again in 1874 and reopened in 1876 with a new ferry. On 13 February 2005 the weather and other conditions caused the guide cables on No.7 to come loose, and the ferry, loaded with 15 cars and 34 passengers, to drift towards the sea. The crew managed to moor it to a buoy before it could collide with other vessels or run aground.

T. Morgan, and D. Charlesworth. 1993. The effect of deleterious mutations on neutral molecular variation. Genetics. 134: 1289-1303. It is one form of linked selection, where the maintenance or removal of an allele from a population is dependent upon the alleles in its linkage group. The name emphasizes the fact that the genetic background, or genomic environment, of a neutral mutation has a significant impact on whether it will be preserved (genetic hitchhiking) or purged (background selection) from a population. In some cases, the term background selection is used broadly to refer to all forms of linked selection, but most often it is used only when neutral variation is reduced due to negative selection against deleterious mutations. Background selection and all forms of linked selection contradict the assumption of the neutral theory of molecular evolution that the fixation or loss of neutral alleles is entirely stochastic, the result of genetic drift. Instead, these models predict that neutral variation is correlated with the selective pressures acting on linked non-neutral genes, that neutral traits are not necessarily oblivious to selection. Because they segregate together, non-neutral mutations linked to neutral polymorphisms result in decreased levels of genetic variation relative to predictions of neutral evolution. Relation to the neutral model The reduction in neutral variation due to background selection can be modeled by an exponential function of the total mutation rate at the deleterious regions of the section of genome involved. The overall effect of background selection on genetic diversity resembles a reduction in effective population size.Charlesworth, D., B. Charlesworth, and M. T. Morgan. 1995. The pattern of neutral molecular variation under the background selection model. Genetics. 141: 1619-1632. As a consequence, background selection has been used to explain many of the inconsistencies between classical models of neutral variation and observed studies of genetic diversity. For instance, the observation that genetic diversity is weakly correlated with population size, or not correlated at all, is called the \\"paradox of variation\\".Hahn, Matthew W. 2008. Towards a selection theory of molecular evolution. Evolution. 62(2): 255-265.Lewontin, R. C. 1974. The genetic basis for evolutionary change. Columbia Univ. Press, New York, NY. Under the theory of background selection, the paradox is resolved, because neutral variation is predicted to be purged in conjunction with deleterious mutations. Background selection also contributes to a selective explanation of the positive correlation between recombination and polymorphism across populations. In areas of high recombination, neutral loci are more likely to ‚Äòescape' the effects of nearby selection and be retained in the population. A version of this scenario has been observed in studies of Drosophila, where regions of low recombination in the genome exhibit low levels of genetic variation. Hudson and Kaplan showed that the difference between the expected and observed levels of variation is explained by accounting for background selection.Hudson, Richard R. and Norman L. Kaplan. 1995. Deleterious background selection with recombination. Genetics. 141: 1605-1617. Calculation Background selection can be measured by assessing the degree of departure of the levels of neutral variants from the predictions of neutral model-based estimations of mutation rates and genetic drift. However, it is not enough to study variation alone because the two main forms of linked selection, background and hitchhiking, produce a loss in diversity, and the models both predict similar results in genomic regions of high recombination. The relative influence of these two effects is not yet well understood, though methods have been developed for differentiating between the two effects. One technique is to compare levels of nucleotide diversity in regions of low recombination, where the models differ appreciably in their predictions.Innan, Hideki and Wolfgang Stephan. 2003. Distinguishing the hitchhiking and background selection models. Genetics. 165: 2307-2312. Thus, studying variation in genomic neighborhoods with relatively low recombination rates, rather than across the whole genome, can yield insights about the relative prevalence of background and hitchhiking selection. Implications for asexual populations Background selection in asexual populations is thought to impact on the speed of Muller's ratchet, the accumulation of irreversible deleterious mutations in nonrecombining populations. Because background selection reduces the effective population size experienced by a region of the genome, and only the portion of an asexual nonrecombining population with the fewest mutations will contribute to future generations, the number of loci where an advantageous mutation could arise and be perpetuated in the population is very small.Charlesworth, Brian. 2012. The effects of deleterious mutations on evolution at linked sites. Genetics. 190: 5-22. That is to say, in a nonrecombining population, all sites behave as though they are closely linked.

The stretch of track runs from Shaftholme Junction north of Doncaster (on the East Coast Main Line between Doncaster and York), via Askern, Norton and Womersley to Knottingley, where it joins the Pontefract Line. History It was opened by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway on 6 June 1848 and running powers were granted to the Great Northern Railway (with which it made an end-on junction at Askern) giving the latter company its initial access to Leeds (using part of the current Pontefract Line) and the former to Doncaster. The line subsequently became part of the newly established East Coast Main Line with the opening of a branch from Knottingley to Burton Salmon in 1850, which gave access to the York & North Midland Railway's line from Normanton to York. The opening of a direct line from Shaftholme Junction to York via Selby in January 1871 saw the end of regular express trains using the route, but it remained busy with goods traffic, mainly coal from various collieries along its length and continued to carry a local stopping service from Wakefield to Doncaster until closure to passengers on 27 September 1948. Today it remains open to carry coal traffic destined for the power stations at Ferrybridge, Drax and Eggborough and passenger trains diverted when either the ECML or Doncaster - Leeds line is closed for engineering work. It also carries a scheduled service operated by Grand Central (as noted). The line today The line now sees regular scheduled passenger services for the first time in more than seventy years, run by open- access operator Grand Central. These trains run between London King's Cross and Bradford Interchange via Doncaster, Knottingley, then on via Pontefract Monkhill, Wakefield Kirkgate, Mirfield, Brighouse and Halifax. The necessary track access rights (for an initial three trains per day each way) were awarded to Grand Central by the ORR in January 2009. Grand Central commence services in the May 2010 timetable change, with the first services running as planned on 23 May 2010. The company subsequently announced that it wished to remove the stops at Pontefract at the next timetable change (December 2011) and divert its remaining services via Adwick to significantly reduce journey times. Permission for this from the ORR has not been forthcoming to date (Autumn 2013) and so the present routing remains. Since December 2013 Grand Central services have added new stop at Mirfield. They have also added a fourth return service via this route. Infrastructure operator Network Rail carried out upgrade works at the southern end of the line between 2012 and 2014. A new flyover was constructed that permits freight services from the ex- West Riding and Grimsby Railway route between and to bridge the ECML and join the line just north of Askern Junction. This allows coal trains from the deep water import terminal at Port of Immingham to run directly to the Aire valley power stations without needing to join the ECML at Joan Croft Junction and use a section from there towards , thus freeing up capacity on a busy section of the route. The new flyover known as Doncaster North Chord, was opened in June 2014. Incidents Askern level crossing On Monday 3 December 1849, a rear collision with a vehicle resulted in a derailment. Four people were injured. Haywood level crossing This level crossing is a CCTV level crossing controlled by Norton Signal Box. On Thursday 26 February 2009, at around 1 pm, an HGV lorry smashed into the barriers, causing delays to freight services. Norton level crossing Norton level crossing is right next to Norton signal box which controls most of the level crossings on the Askern branch line. On Thursday 21 June 2012, a Land Rover smashed through the barriers after fleeing from a burglary, and smashed into two waiting cars at the other side of the crossing. This resulting in a full road closure, major delays to the freight services and to the London King's Cross to Bradford Interchange service. Four barriers were totally wrecked, so Network Rail replaced them. Further investigation of the level crossing crash is still underway.

The series is hosted by Steve Lawrence and Don Rickles and produced by Bob Booker. The series theme song was performed by Billy May and the show music was composed by Kevin Kiner. Produced as a response to NBC's TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes, this series similarly focused on outtakes from popular television programs and movies. The series also included a Candid Camera-like segment showing people caught in amusing situations by hidden cameras. The word blooper was not allowed to be uttered, with the term \\"foul-up\\" substituted where applicable. (During the 1980s, ABC dabbled with the same format with a similar series of specials hosted separately by John Ritter and Steve Allen, titled Life's Most Embarrassing Moments.) The series debuted on January 10, 1984 as a mid-season replacement series, and returned at the start of the 1984-85 season, however after October 1984 the show ceased to be a weekly offering on ABC and instead aired at various times as filler for the next few months before resuming weekly broadcast in the spring, after which it was cancelled. The network was nervous having Don Rickles, known for his personal insults, as a co-host. Fearful of offending their audience with condescending humor, ABC had the producers reshoot sections for the first episode without Rickles. The irony was that the shows initial audience ratings were huge just because of that fact; people tuning in to see what Rickles was going to say. But once the network muzzled Don‚Äôs humor, people tuned out and the show barely lasted two seasons. The most notable episode of Foul-Ups, Bleeps & Blunders featured guest star William Shatner introducing a set of bloopers taken from the original Star Trek. Shatner, in his introduction, stated that this was the first time these outtakes had ever been shown on network television. (\\"I've got chills,\\" Rickles replied, sarcastically.) After the closing credits, the Bob Booker Production logo had two men that were about ready to strike a gong (a la the Rank Organisation's \\"Gongman\\"), with the man on the right (holding the gong mallet) striking the man on the left in the groin region and leaving him in agony (this was followed by a gong sound).

Often called the \\"Mother Church of Northern Virginia,\\" the church is notable for its association with important figures in early Virginian history such as George Washington and George Mason, both of whom served on its vestry. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. History Early colonial period: first churches The origins of Pohick Church can be traced to a chapel of ease for Overwharton Parish, which appears to have been built around 1695 in the Woodlawn area of today's community of Mount Vernon. This church, the first in the parish and thus the first in Northern Virginia, was recorded in a 1715 land grant as being along the Potomac Path, the \\"county main road,\\" which today is U.S. Route 1. In 1730 the parish relocated the church south, building a frame structure, the so-called \\"church above Occoquan Ferry\\" near what later became the community of Colchester. The site of this church is today occupied by Cranford United Methodist Church; there, a stone in the churchyard marks the original site of Pohick Church, and a walkway of oversized brick on the property is thought to date from the period of the original building. No other trace of the original structure or its site exists; the last remnant was the cemetery, whose location is known but which was empty of grave markers by 1938. By 1730, the population of the parish had grown substantially, and it was decided by the Virginia General Assembly to create a new parish, Hamilton, out of Overwharton to better serve the needs of the people. The church at Occoquan became the parish church of this new parish. In 1732 another split was made, and Truro Parish was formed; the church, now renamed \\"Pohick Church\\" in honor of its position along Pohick Creek, became the parish church for this new parish as well, being the only church then in the neighborhood. The first person to preach there was the Reverend Lawrence DeButts, who in 1733 was contracted to preach at various points around the parish three times a month for a year, for the sum of eight thousand pounds of tobacco. Dr. Charles Green was the first rector of Pohick Church; he was successfully sponsored by Augustine Washington, father of George, who was elected to the church vestry in 1735. Green was confirmed to the post in 1736 and traveled to London for ordination, returning to take up his duties the following year. During his tenure as rector Green was involved in a major scandal when he was accused by Lawrence Washington of sexual misconduct with his wife Anne.Peter R. Henriques, \\"Major Lawrence Washington versus the Reverend Charles Green: A Case Study of the Squire and the Parson\\", Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 100 no. 2 (April 1992), pp. 233‚Äì64, accessed 13 November 2011 Washington demanded Green's ouster from his post at the church; Green refused, and brought countersuit against Washington for slander, whereupon the latter demanded an ecclesiastical trial. This took place in the chapel of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg beginning on November 6, 1745; before a verdict was reached, however, Governor William Gooch stepped in and ordered Green to drop the suit, in exchange for which he would not be removed from his post. In the end, the rector remained at Pohick for the next twenty years as a respected clergyman; at his death in 1765 George Washington served as his executor. He was replaced as rector by Lee Massey, a former lawyer who was ordained in 1766 and took up his post the following year. Massey's duties frequently took him to other churches in the parish, and as a result Pohick Church was not open for services every Sunday of the year. George Mason began his long association with the church in February 1749‚Äì50, when he was named warden to replace the deceased Jeremiah Bronaugh; he would go on to serve the congregation as a vestryman until the dissolution of vestries after the American Revolutionary War. Also elected to the post of warden, on October 25, 1762, was George Washington. He, too, would go on to serve as vestryman, attending frequent meetings at the church despite its distance from his home at Mount Vernon; he also remained otherwise quite active in the parish, and is said to have often persuaded house guests to attend services with him. In October 1763, Washington and George William Fairfax were appointed churchwardens for the following year. Construction of the present church The floor plan of the church as depicted by Benson Lossing in 1859, copied from a now-unlocated original source. By 1767, the Pohick vestry determined that the now-dilapidated frame structure serving the parish should be replaced. George Washington argued the need for finding a new location, believing that the new building should be more centrally located, at the intersection of the Potomac Path and the back road ‚Äì today's Telegraph Road ‚Äì for the convenience of members of the congregation. George Mason, for his part, argued that the new structure should be built at the site of the old church, as the cemetery contained the graves of many family members; Washington is supposed to have responded by surveying the new location, showing that it was more convenient to most members of the parish, and presenting the results to a meeting of the vestry, whereupon Mason's objection was dropped, although he is reported to have stalked out of the meeting, exclaiming, \\"That's what gentlemen get for engaging in a debate with a damned surveyor!\\" The final vote was seven to five in favor of moving the site of the church. The new location was settled on, and a building committee was impaneled; its members were Washington, Mason, George William Fairfax, Daniel McCarty, and Edward Payne. Recalling the Biblical image of a \\"city upon a hill\\", the highest point of land in the vicinity was chosen as the site of the new church. Twenty percent of the building's cost was raised at a 1772 auction of pews in which many local landowners participated; the remainder came from tithes and other contributions, including three annual levies on the tobacco crop. The churchyard was laid out at a meeting of the vestry, held on the future site of the church, in 1769; three acres and twenty-six perches of land were purchased, at the rate of a guinea an acre, and the deed was made by Daniel French of Rose Hill, also the first contractor of the building. French was to be paid ¬£877 for his work, in Virginia currency. This image, published in 1915, depicts Pohick Church and its congregation as it would have been seen in the late eighteenth century. The original plan for Pohick Church was drawn up by James Wren, and was identical to that used for both The Falls Church and Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia; however, at some point during the construction process the footprint of the church was altered to that seen today. Some sources have claimed that George Washington himself drew up the design for the building, and at least one hints that George Mason, too, might have provided input; however, records show that in March 1769 the vestry paid James Wren and William West for the church plans. Construction was initially overseen by the planter Daniel French of Rose Hill, a member of the congregation. He died before completion of the building works, and oversight passed to William Buckland, who was also involved in the building of Gunston Hall nearby, and who may have participated in the decoration of the church interior as well; it is possible that Buckland took over the work at the instigation of his employer, George Mason, who had assumed many of French's debts and obligations at the latter's death. Much of the original woodwork in the building was executed by master carver William Bernard Sears, a longtime associate of Buckland's who was also attached to Gunston Hall, likely in indenture to Mason, and is known to have worked at Mount Vernon as well. The account presented by him for his services survives, and indicates that he was paid ¬£58:19:0 for his craft. Plans for the church complex also called for the installation of mounting blocks and six benches in the churchyard, so that people could sit under the trees, and for the area to be cleared of all rubbish and litter. Washington's records indicate that he took an interest in furnishing the new church; besides paying William Copan for carving ciphers on both his pew and that of his neighbor Fairfax, he fitted his own pew with drawers, and also paid for a latch and a door for the church building. An early plan describing the initial disposition and ownership of pews in the building was copied by Benson Lossing and republished by him in 1859; the original is currently unlocated. A 1774 entry in the church vestry book assigns an unusual order to four of the pews, stating: \\"Ordered that the Upper Pew in the new Church adjoining the South Wall be appropriated to the Use of the Magistrates and Strangers, and the Pew opposite thereto to the use of their Wives, and the two Pews next below them be appropriated to the Vestrymen and Merchants and their Wives, in like manner.\\" The two most notable pewholders were George Mason and George Washington; other pews were kept by William Triplett, George William Fairfax, Alexander Henderson, Lund Washington (cousin of George), John Manley, Martin Cockburn, and Daniel McCarty. The eight pews located in the west end of the church were set aside for \\"Inhabitants and House Keepers of the Parish\\". Construction of the church building was completed in 1774, just before the start of the American Revolutionary War. Early discussions of the Fairfax Resolves took place at the site in that year; among those in attendance at the meetings were George Washington and George Mason, and Rector Massey was among the signatories at their adoption. William Grayson is said to have been a member of the congregation in these years as well, and he is recorded as having served as an attorney for Truro Parish on numerous occasions. Early Federal period Sketch of the church dating to c. 1830, drawn by one of the children of George Mason With the Religious Freedom Act of 1785, the Virginia General Assembly formally disestablished the Church of England. Many former Anglican turned Episcopal churches, fell into decline, including Pohick Church. It remained active; Mason Weems, better known as a biographer of George Washington, preached at the church off and on from around 1798 until at least 1817, and styled himself as the \\"formerly rector\\" of the congregation, though this was likely an exaggeration. Another fixture at the church was Reverend Charles O'Neill, remembered chiefly for having been presented with a used suit of Washington's clothes, which he would wear while preaching, although it did not fit him well; he was held to be quite popular among local families. Little else is known of the history of the structure from 1777 to 1836, although the vestry book records that George Washington resigned from the vestry in 1782, and that Rector Massey ceased his regular duties shortly thereafter due to ill health. Furthermore, Washington is known to have stopped attending regular services at Pohick by this time, having instead shifted his attention to Christ Church in Alexandria as his preferred house of worship; even so, he kept up payments on his pew at the church, and purchased that of his cousin Lund as well. In 1801 John Davis wrote a surviving account of a service at Pohick Church; it indicates that at the time of his visit approximately half the congregation was white and half black. Davis also attended a number of services preached by Weems, and found them well-attended. Oral tradition indicates that Pohick Church was targeted by the British during the War of 1812 for its association with George Washington. One of the parishioners had carved a wooden dove, gilded it, and placed it on Washington's former pew, although some accounts state instead that it was affixed to the pulpit. According to the story, the sculpture was decapitated by a British soldier who also removed its wings, and was then thrown into the church courtyard, whence it was later retrieved. It was returned to the family of the sculptor, a Mr. Bowie, and passed down among his descendants before being returned to the congregation in 1988. It is on display in the parish house of the church. Otherwise, it is recorded that the interior of the building remained largely intact until the time of the American Civil War. William Meade, later to become Episcopal Bishop of Virginia, visited the church in the summer of 1837, and described what he had seen in an address made the following year: > My next visit was to Pohick Church, in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon, the seat > of General Washington. It was still raining when I approached the house, and > found no one there. The wide open doors invited me to enter, as they do > invite, day and night through the year, not only the passing traveller, but > every beast of the field and fowl of the air. These latter however seemed to > have reverenced the house of God, since few marks of their pollution were to > be seen throughout it. The interior of the house, having been well built, is > still good. The chancel, Communion table and tables of the law &c.; are > still there and in good order. The roof only is decaying; and at the time I > was there the rain was dropping on these sacred places and on other parts of > the house. On the doors of the pews, in gilt letters, are still to be seen > the names of the principal Families which once occupied them. How could I, > while for at least an hour traversing those long aisles, ascending the lofty > pulpit, entering the sacred chancel, forbear to ask, And is this the House > of God which was built by the Washingtons, the Mc.Cartys, the Lewises, the > Fairfaxes?‚Äîthe house in which they used to worship the God of our fathers > according to the venerable forms of the Episcopal Church, and some of whose > names are still to be seen on the doors of those now deserted pews? Is this > also destined to moulder piecemeal away, or, when some signal is given, to > become the prey of spoilers, and to be carried hither and thither and > applied to every purpose under heaven? On the strength of this appeal, the Reverend W. P. C. Johnson, then serving as a tutor at Gunston Hall, became the first post-Colonial rector to serve the church. Within a few years, Johnson, whose wife was a daughter of Bushrod Washington, was able to raise fifteen hundred dollars for repairs, largely on the strength of the Bishop's account; Meade further noted, however, that the doors belonging to the Washington and Mason pews were gone, although most of the others remained. Among those who provided funds to fix the leaking roof were John Quincy Adams, Martin van Buren, Daniel Webster, Francis Scott Key, and Henry Clay. The church continued serving an active Episcopal parish, being staffed sporadically by students from the Virginia Theological Seminary after Johnson's 1840 departure; in addition, a Methodist congregation held services in the building for some years in the 1850s, and a debating society used it for meetings for a time. 1835 painting of the church by John Gadsby Chapman Benson Lossing attended a Methodist service at Pohick Church on December 10, 1848, and recorded the event in his widely-read Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution; he stated in his account that during the service he sat in the Washington family pew. He also noted the presence of a number of broken windows in the building. Furthermore, he recorded that the pulpit appeared to have been the target of vandals, and that birds had built nests around it and otherwise used it as a perch. The account also states that the altarpiece was still extant at this time. Lossing counted twenty-one members of the congregation, white and black combined, on this occasion. Also included in the book is a description of the site of the church; at the time of the writer's visit, it stood on the edge of a primeval forest composed largely of oaks, pines, and chestnuts, which extended \\"almost uninterruptedly\\" to Mount Vernon. The earliest known detailed picture of the church building dates to this period in its history; it was painted by John Gadsby Chapman, and shows the dilapidated state to which the structure had been reduced. Dating to 1835, it is believed to have been painted to raise money for the restoration fund, although this is uncertain. The painting is in the church collection, but has been loaned to Mount Vernon for display. American Civil War By 1860, conditions at Pohick Church had deteriorated to such a state that it is unclear whether or not the building remained a consecrated house of worship at the dawn of the American Civil War. With its proximity to Washington, D.C., the building was quickly embroiled in the fighting that rocked Northern Virginia. although in that year a plan was formed by a clergyman from Fairfax, Reverend R. T. Brown, to return the building to active service, a plan which was quashed by the beginning of the conflict. The 2nd Michigan Volunteers, under the command of General Samuel P. Heintzelman, raided the church on November 12, 1861. Lieutenant Charles B. Haydon was outraged at the men's behavior, describing it thus: > At 8¬Ω A.M. we reached the church 12 miles out. Pohick Church is a brick > building built in 1773. Gen. Washington contributed to building it & was a > frequent attendant. It has a very ancient look & one would suppose that it > might be sacred enough to be secure. I have long known that the Mich 2nd had > no fear or reverence as a general thing for God or the places where he is > worshiped but I had hoped that the memory of Gen. Washington might protect > almost anything with which it was associated. I believe our soldiers would > have torn the church down in 2 days. They were all over it in less than 10 > minutes tearing off the ornaments, splitting the woodwork and pews, knocking > the brick to pieces & everything else they could get at. They wanted pieces > to carry away ... A more absolute set of vandals than our men can not be > found on the face of the earth. As true as I am living I believe they would > steal Washington's coffin if they could get to it. Private Robert Sneden visited the church in January 1862. He painted a watercolor of the encampments around the building and described its condition in his journal: > We reached Pohick Church about 4 pm in a snow storm ... It was a substantial > two story brick structure with white marble, quoins and trimmings and old > colonial gambrel roof ... Here Washington attended service, with all the old > first families of the time ... He drove from Mount Vernon to church in his > coach with four horses, tandem fashion as did the others. Now the church was > in ruinous condition. Windows were all broken out, doors gone, pews nearly > gone, being used for firewood by our pickets. The ceilings broken by the > rain coming through the roof, walls discolored black by smoke, etc. The > mahogany pulpit was half cut away and carried off for relics, while the > cornerstones had been unearthed and the contents carried off. Washington had > lain this stone in 1765 [sic] and the soldiers who got it out must have > found valuable relics. There was not much left for the relic hunters now > even the sconces and door knobs and hinges were gone. Confederate General J. Johnston Pettigrew also recorded visiting Pohick Church in his wartime journal. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe soon took over the church as a base of operations, and a garrison stationed at the site began to use the building as quarters. The men left graffiti behind on the church doorposts, quoins, and walls; much of it is still visible today, as are bullet holes in the exterior walls. From this location Lowe repeatedly launched his balloon, Intrepid, to track Confederate troop movements along the Occoquan River, and here he saw the earliest successes of his short-lived Federal Balloon Corps. The church was used as a stable by Union forces during the winter of 1862‚Äì63, during which time the interior was stripped of everything save the upper cornice. Some of this damage was documented by Mathew Brady in a photograph taken in 1862. Civil War graffiti, still visible on the exterior walls of the church Skirmishes are known to have taken place in the vicinity of the church throughout the war; the area was officially neutral ground, but was populated by guerrillas attempting to disrupt local military operations. Jacob Erwin of Company C of the 1st New York Cavalry, killed in one such action, is believed to have been the first volunteer cavalryman of the Army of the Potomac to have been killed during the conflict. Robert E. Lee is recorded as having been a member of the congregation at some time during this period of its history. Post-Civil War The congregation of Pohick Church had scattered thoroughly by the end of the war, so that for a time the building stood empty and unused. In 1874 the structure began to see a return to its original purpose once again. Renovations, paid for by a donor from New York City, were undertaken beginning in that year to make it suitable for use, but no attempt was made to restore the church to its colonial splendor. The box pews were replaced by straight benches, and other architectural elements were added which bore traces of the Victorian Gothic style. A large platform was installed at the eastern end of the building, and on this a vestry room was partitioned off and constructed at the north end. Many of the furnishings were donated by a congregation from New York. A service of reconsecration, led by the Episcopal Bishop of Virginia, John Johns, was conducted on the first Sunday of October 1875. After this the congregation was once again served by students from the Virginia Theological Seminary until a permanent rector was appointed in 1881. A rectory was purchased for the church in 1883, and by 1908 the church property consisted of forty-three acres of land as well as the rectory and parish hall. Pohick Church on occasion played host to dignitaries; in 1878 President Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife Lucy attended a service there after having spent the night at Mount Vernon. stereoscopic photograph taken sometime after the Civil War, shows the state to which Pohick Church had been reduced. Note the missing windows and doors. In 1894 the original vestry book of Pohick Church was recovered by Reverend Philip Slaughter, an event which appears to have inspired new interest in the history of the parish. Contributing to the new attitude was the publication of two books, The Life and Correspondence of George Mason by Kate Mason Rowland in 1891 and Dr. Slaughter's own The History of Truro Parish in Virginia in 1908. These works, coupled with the efforts during the nineteenth century of Reverend Samuel Wallis, introduced parishioners, previously cognizant only of George Washington's connection with the church, to the roles played by the McCarty family, George Mason, Jeremiah Bronaugh, and Lee Massey, among others, in its history. Not long after the structure reopened for worship, the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, at the instigation of a member of the vestry, began to take an interest in its workings. The association took a pew in the church, and members sometimes attended services there. Another major restoration effort resulted from this interest. This one, designed to replicate the colonial fabric of the church as best could be managed, began in 1890 and continued until 1917. These repairs were spearheaded by the Ladies' Association and the Daughters of the American Revolution. They were overseen by architect Glenn Brown, and much of the woodwork currently visible in the church is his handiwork. Contributions to the repair fund came from around the country, and descendants of the original pewholders were contacted to restore their respective families' pews. Phoebe Hearst provided the money to construct a temporary space for worship to continue while the original church was being refitted; this white frame structure soon became known as \\"Hearst Hall\\" in her honor, and went on to serve as a parish hall for the community. Additional support for the project was provided by Harrison Howell Dodge, a member of the vestry who served as superintendent of Mount Vernon for many years. The restoration also saw the replacement of the pulpit with one patterned along colonial lines. In 1912 a pew in the church was dedicated to Ann Pamela Cunningham, first regent of the Ladies' Association, for her work in preserving both Mount Vernon and the church, a dedication which no longer exists. In 1916 an endowment was in the process of being raised to provide support for the congregation, which was described by numerous sources as being poor and lacking the money necessary to support repairs to the building; at this time the rector was Reverend Everard Meade, a grandson of the bishop whose account had earlier made the church's plight known. Some original pieces of the interior fittings have been returned to the church as part of the restoration works; a piece of the balustrade surrounding the communion rail was sent back by the taker or a member of his family, as was a fragment of the Washington pew; the latter, returned in 1986, provided an indication of the original color of the woodwork, and provided a match to be used in the refitting of the interior. The church continues to be home to an active congregation, members of which give tours of the structure after Sunday services and at sporadic other times; the building is also open for self- guided tours daily. A chapter of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew has existed at the church for many years, and is today one of the largest and most active in the country. Documentation and recognition Pohick Church was photographed by Frances Benjamin Johnston in 1930 as part of the Carnegie Survey of the Architecture of the South; it was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1941. A historical marker was erected by the state of Virginia commemorating the history of the structure in 1934, and can still be seen today, located just outside the church property itself. Next to it is a sign placed by the Civil War Trails Program in 2014 and detailing the Civil War-era history of the church and grounds. Also at the site is a marker detailing the history of the old telegraph line, one of the first in the world, which ran nearby and which is today memorialized in the name of Telegraph Road. The church is the centerpiece of a historic overlay district established by Fairfax County in 1970; it was the first such district designated by the county. It was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1968, and to the National Register of Historic Places the following year. Restoration and maintenance of the church property is currently overseen by the Historic Pohick Church Foundation, formally known as the Pohick Church Endowment Fund Inc., a nonprofit organization established in 1983. Architecture Exterior Pohick Church is a two-story tall rectangular building with a hipped roof and modillioned cornice. There is a roof overhang of about three feet. Its dimensions at the time of construction were fixed at sixty-six feet in length and forty-five-and-a-half feet in breadth; the specification indicated that the walls were to be twenty-eight feet tall. The construction material, Flemish bond described initially as \\"good Bricks well burnt\\", were baked at or near the site of the church. The water table is considered to be of note, as it combines concave and convex styles. White freestone was used for various fittings on the building, and the window arches are of rubbed brick. The windows of the first floor have flat lintels, those on the second story have arches. The exterior stonework has been described as \\"especially fine\\"; the rusticated surround of each of the western entries is framed by Ionic pilasters and topped with a pedimented frieze. The main entrance, at the south, is similar in construction, but with a triple keystone instead of the single one used over other doors. Also notable are the quoins at the corners of the building. The doors are trimmed with Aquia Creek sandstone, using designs common to English architectural books of the period. More specifically, they have been traced to the publications of James Gibbs, and were likely executed by stonemason William Copein. The exterior has been restored on multiple occasions, and much of the building's external fabric has been renewed. The complex is surrounded by a low brick wall, donated in 1917 by a group of prominent citizens from New York. Such a wall had been part of the original design when the church was completed, but was ultimately rejected by the vestry as being too expensive; it was replaced with a wooden post fence. Stylistically, the church has been described as belonging to the Late Georgian school of architecture, with Palladian tendencies; one source has called it \\"a sophisticated essay in the Georgian style\\", and states that it \\"recalls the more refined dissenter chapels of 18th-century England\\". Interior Interior of the church, showing the pulpit and central aisle; in the center is the old baptismal font. The church interior, described by one writer as \\"probably the most sophisticated interior of its time in the colonies\\", contains two aisles, with a separate entry door for each one. The box pews conform to the traditional English arrangement. Markers have been affixed to many pews in memory of past members of the church community. As nearly the whole of the original interior woodwork was destroyed during the Civil War, what exists today is an example of early Colonial Revival design dating to the restorations of the early twentieth century. A view of the box pews from above The altarpiece, twenty feet high and fifteen wide, is in wainscot, with Ionic decorations. As per Anglican requirements, it displays the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. In the pediment window is a cross, 42 inches high, carved of walnut from Mount Vernon and faced with gold leaf. The church is provided with a modern tracker organ, completed by Fritz Noack in 1969 to a design by Charles Fisk, with carvings executed by Roger Martin. This instrument contains 880 pipes, with thirteen stops and seventeen ranks. The pulpit, also Ionic in its fittings, is carved of pine, as are its canopy and the reading desks; the gold leaf used to execute portions of its decoration was donated by George Washington. Its base is formed in the wineglass style. Below the pew box under the pulpit is the grave of the Reverend Lee Massey, last colonial rector of Truro Parish; his remains were removed to the church in 1908 from the former site of his house, Bradley, the first in a series of reinterments of early parishioners in the church and churchyard. The entirety of the church interior is painted a putty color, which serves to unify the various architectural elements within, as does the clarity of the design of the space as a whole. Two baptismal fonts remain in the church. The newer of the two was carved by William Copein from a design in a book by Batty Langley; its base was destroyed during the American Civil War and it was removed from the church for some time, although it was later returned. The older has been dated to the eleventh or twelfth century, and appears to have once been a mortar from a monastery refectory; many such pieces were shipped to the American colonies for liturgical use, and the font is associated with an earlier church occupied by the congregation. It was restored in 1890 and continues to be in use for baptisms. The chandeliers lighting the building are French, and were given as a memorial to members of the congregation who served in the European theater of World War II.Plaque inside the church Also inside the church is a memorial, dedicated by President Warren Harding on May 29, 1921, to six men of the Mount Vernon and Lee Districts who had been killed in World War I. Another memorial was raised to the novelist Vaughan Kester, who died at Gunston Hall, by his mother. A description of the interior prior to its restoration survives in an oral history of the church: > The Church had been practically abandoned for some years and was in a bad > state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work that had been done by > William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been > molested. My mother used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and > Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears > had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to > be looking at her no matter where she sat. Little remains of the original interior fabric of the church, save for the cornice and one baluster on the chancel rail. Much of the rest is a conjectural reconstruction dating to the early years of the twentieth century. Notably, despite the presence of the second tier of windows there was no gallery inside during the colonial era; the current gallery was installed early in the twentieth century. Further restoration of the interior is in progress. Contemporary fittings inside the church include needlework cushions in a number of pews, worked by women of the parish and friends of the congregation and depicting symbols and scenes of historic significance both to Pohick Church and the surrounding area; the Episcopal Church as a whole; and the state of Virginia. Ancillary buildings On November 5, 1772, during a meeting of the Truro Parish vestry, it was ordered that a vestry house be built at Pohick Church. Specifications were laid that the structure be built of brick, twenty-four by eighteen feet, with a wooden floor and a chimney inside, three windows, and walls one-and-a-half bricks thick. In 1774 the vestry rescinded its order, as the cost of construction was found to be too great. The plan was revived in 1931 to commemorate the bicentennials of both the parish and the birth of George Washington; the resulting structure, completed in that year, was constructed of old brick and incorporates a fireplace mantel from an 18th-century house and a fender from the 1753 glebe house of the parish. The structure, which stands to the east of the church, continues to be used by the vestry for meetings and contains a gift shop as well, proceeds from whose sales are used to support church missions and other outreach projects. To the south of the church is a parish house, completed in 1955 in a style complementary to that of the main building; an addition to this structure was constructed in the 1980s. To the southwest sits the rectory, completed in 1963. The belfry in the churchyard was erected at the time of the restoration works in the early twentieth century, and was fitted at its construction with a bronze bell inscribed \\"In Memory of Washington\\"; it was the gift of a donor from New York, Augustus Schermerhorn. None of these ancillary structures is included in the National Register nomination, nor are they considered of historic significance in the County's discussions of the site. Archives and collections Numerous gifts have been presented to Pohick Church over the years; these include a plate and cup of hammered silver, dating to 1711 and 1716 respectively; a chalice from the United States Marine Corps; a bread box and silver cruets, from the Corps of Engineers; and a silver paten. More recent gifts have included several pieces of silver crafted in Alexandria. A cross for the altar table was provided by the Bishop of Washington, D.C. Due to the vicissitudes of the congregation's history, the archives of Pohick Church are not extensive. Nevertheless, they do contain a handful of notable books and documents. Chief among these is the original vestry book of Truro Parish, which documents every vestry from 1732 until the organization was disbanded on January 23, 1785. The book was then used by the Overseers of the Poor, legal successors to the vestry, until 1802. The book was lost for 75 years ‚Äì William Meade writes that he \\"can hear no tidings\\" of it in Old Churches and Families in Virginia, published in 1857 ‚Äì but was eventually repurchased by the church for $20. It was held for a time at Mount Vernon, and was later deposited with the Library of Congress, with copies left with the church office for record-keeping. The vestry book has been digitized, and is available online for perusal. Other books in the church archive include a 1761 prayer book imported by George Washington, later adapted by erasure and insertion from the old order into the new. A two-volume Bible of 1796 was donated to the church in 1802 by George Washington Parke Custis; it is inscribed inside by him, and further contains an inscription written by a Civil War soldier who took possession of it in 1861. It was later found in a collection of old books which had been donated to the church by an unknown person. Other books in the library have been donated by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. The pledge book circulated by Reverend Johnson to raise funds for repairs, which contains the signatures of many notables of the period, still exists. The archive also contains the grave marker of Katherine Popkins, dated 1766, which is the lone surviving stone from the graveyard of the congregation's former location in Colchester. Cemetery The Fitzhugh family graves in the churchyard, photographed in 2009. The cemetery of Pohick Church was initially surveyed and platted to the west of the church building, and was only officially organized in 1886. Burials are formally recorded as having taken place in the churchyard beginning in 1840, although oral tradition among some local families indicates that some interments took place as early as the 1790s, and John Gadsby Chapman's painting of the church dated 1835 depicts some tombstones in the yard, several broken or toppled, near the site of the current vestry house. Locations of these earlier graves are now unknown; all pre-1886 grave markers seen in the cemetery today have been moved to the site from elsewhere in Fairfax County. Additional land was added to the cemetery in 1920. A memorial garden, accepting only cremated remains, also exists on the church grounds, at the foot of the belfry. The oldest remaining tombstones original to the cemetery are those of Eliza Harover, erected in 1865, and John Robertson, dating to the following year; the burial of Ann S. Nevitt, on October 2, 1875, is the first for which a written record was kept. The grave of Will Harris A number of figures notable in the early history of Fairfax County and the surrounding area are buried in the cemetery, many of their graves having been moved from other sites over the years. Among these are a number of members of the Fitzhugh family, including Continental Congressman William Fitzhugh. The Fitzhugh plantation, Ravensworth, was the centerpiece of the largest landholding in the county; its plantation house was destroyed by fire in 1926, and the graves from the family cemetery were moved to the church in 1957. The graves of several members of the Alexander family, for whom Alexandria is named, were relocated from Preston Plantation in 1922. The grave of Will Harris (died 1698), formerly of Neabsco Plantation in Prince William County, is the oldest in Fairfax County; it was moved from its original location in 1954 as a result of highway construction. Other graves and gravestones in the churchyard were moved from Summer Hill, Bradley, Stisted (in the former town of Colchester), Mount Air, Cedar Grove, Belmont, Springfield, Cameron, and Halstead plantations; also reinterred there were remains from the West family cemetery in Alexandria. Daniel French, original contractor of the present church building, is also buried in the churchyard; at his death in 1771, he was interred at Rose Hill, but his grave was moved in 1954. The grave of the wife of the first rector of the current church, Elizabeth Massey, is near the vestry house; her husband, Lee, is interred inside the church building. Both of their bodies were moved from the cemetery of their plantation, Bradley, in 1908. The grave of William Brown, Surgeon General of the Continental Army and personal physician to George Washington, is also among those which have been removed to the churchyard over the years. Other notable figures buried at Pohick Church include novelist and playwright Paul Kester and his mother; Kester, whose brother Vaughan is memorialized inside the church, had lived locally at both Gunston Hall and Woodlawn at different stages of his career, and had served for a time as a member of the church vestry. George A. Malcolm, teacher at the Lorton Valley School and Fairfax County deputy sheriff, is also interred in the churchyard; he was shot on April 6, 1905, while attempting to arrest a man who had been harassing students at the school, and became the County's first law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty. At the time of his death he was also serving as the deputy treasurer of the Mount Vernon and Lee districts. Harrison Howell Dodge is also buried in the cemetery, as is former White House Chief Usher Howell G. Crim. Near the Fitzhugh graves is a memorial marker to Long Tom, a chief of the Doeg tribe,Some accounts have claimed that he was a chief of the \\"Orinoco\\" or \\"Oronoco\\" tribe, but no group of Indians by this name is known in Virginia. who according to legend was killed by Susanna Alexander to save either herself or her husband John during an attack. According to Alexander family lore, he was buried at the Preston plantation cemetery and his remains were moved to Pohick with those of the family; the exact location of his grave in the churchyard, however, is not known. A memorial to John Augustine Washington, brother of George, was erected by a local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1986, but it does not mark a known gravesite. The first wife of Rear Admiral Donald Temple Eller is buried at Pohick Church; the Admiral is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, but some of his ashes were interred next to her grave. Also in the churchyard is the grave of Carnegie Medal recipient John Charles Springer, who served as a vestryman at the church and as secretary of the Historic Pohick Church Foundation. Memorial to Long Tom A memorial to the unknown dead interred in the cemetery was erected in 1925, and has since been set into the brick wall surrounding the parish house. It reads: > To the Unknown Dead of Pohick Church this Tribute of Respect is paid the > Many Parishioners Buried in this Hallowed Churchyard The Records are Lost & > the Graves cannot now be identified 1925 Several surveys of the cemetery have taken place over the years, beginning with that done by Carrie White Avery in 1923. The results of another survey, done in 1967, were published by Edna May Stevens and Lesba Lewis Thompson as Tombstone Records of Pohick Church, Fairfax County, Virginia. A third survey, done by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints from the Annandale, Virginia stake, was sponsored by the Fairfax Genealogical Society; its results were checked against earlier parish records, and the entire survey was rechecked for errors in the summer of 1998. The cemetery remains active and open to members of the congregation for burial; it is not a public cemetery, and interment is restricted to members of the congregation and those non-members with family buried there. Earlier remains continue to be reinterred there as well; if unmarked graves are found on land whose ownership can be traced back to original members of the parish, the church is willing to discuss moving them to the churchyard. Fences and permanent plantings are prohibited in the churchyard, and use of artificial flowers is restricted, as is the design of gravestones. Remeum Charles Mason Remey, a descendant of George Mason, contracted with Pohick Church in 1937 to build a family mausoleum on its grounds, to be located on five acres of land about one half- mile south of the church building. Called \\"the Remeum\\", it was to be a \\"magnificent complex of walled courtyards, underground chambers with soaring vaulted ceilings, marble reliefs and statues, carved pillars, chapels and burial vaults\\", and was planned as a memorial to his family and its contributions to American history. Construction began in 1939; when finished, the structure was four times the size of Pohick Church itself. Sculptural work was done for the mausoleum by Felix de Weldon; reliefs illustrated historic events in which the family participated, and depicted scenes from the lives of Saints Peter, Paul, and Stephen. The structure was guarded by a pair of sleeping lions, and statues inside included depictions of Faith and Charity as well as a copy of the Bruges Madonna of Michaelangelo and life-sized statues of Remey's parents and wife. Also inside was a massive marble sarcophagus, transported from Lisbon, for Remey himself. The grounds were landscaped, the underground areas electrified. A trust account was established with the church for maintenance. Remey eventually transported the bodies of fifteen other relatives to the mausoleum, mostly from his home state of Iowa. Some two million bricks were used in the construction of the mausoleum, and Remey planned to crown it with a three-story structure that would have dwarfed the church. Problems soon developed, and the mausoleum site became the target of vandals. As a preventative measure, the entrance was bricked up to prevent access, but the wall was breached in 1956. By 1958 the church vestry became concerned, and in 1962 refused to grant permission for any more work to be done on the site. Soon negotiations began to break the original contract; in 1968 the property reverted to the church, and Remey was given five years to remove anything of value from the site. Most of the dead were taken by relatives to another family cemetery in New York; Remey's wife Gertrude was reinterred in the main church cemetery. After the last of the bodies was removed, the Remeum was demolished beginning in 1973, and the last of the aboveground ruins was finally bulldozed ten years later. Little remains on the site to mark the former presence of the complex save an obelisk dedicated to Remey's parents and a pair of structures which served as chimneys or vents. Urban legends about the site persist, describing parties in the crypts below the mausoleum. Cultural references Pohick Church and its cemetery play a large role in the children's novel Cinnabar, the One O'Clock Fox by Marguerite Henry, published in 1956. Private Robert Knox Sneden of the Union Army was stationed at the church during the Civil War, and it figures prominently in his diary and watercolors, which were published in 2002 as Eye of the Storm.

The prosecution case rested heavily on Herndon's possession of \\"communist literature\\", which police found in his hotel room.Brown-Nagin, Tomiko, Courage to Dissent: Atlanta and the Long History of the Civil Rights Movement (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011). Herndon was defended by the International Labor Defense, the legal arm of the Communist Party, which hired two young local attorneys, Benjamin J. Davis Jr. and John H. Geer, and provided guidance. Davis later became prominent in leftist circles. Over a five-year period, Herndon's case twice reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that Georgia's insurrection law was unconstitutional, as it violated First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly. Herndon became nationally prominent because of his case, and Southern justice was under review. By the end of the 1940s he left the Communist Party, moved to the Midwest and lived there quietly. Early life and education Born into a poor family in southwestern Ohio, Angelo Herndon endured racial discrimination in his city, where African Americans have been a minority. He attended public schools but moved to Kentucky at the age of 14 to work in the mines. By 1930 he was working in Birmingham, Alabama, for the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company. As a youth, Herndon was given a copy of the Communist Manifesto by a white worker in the Unemployed Councils, a group affiliated with the Communist Party. He was impressed with the Party's campaigning in the South to promote labor reform and interracial cooperation, and its teachings on racial equality and class conflict. He joined the party in 1930. After being arrested several times in Alabama for labor organizing, Herndon was sent to Atlanta, Georgia in the fall of 1931. Political activism Herndon went to Atlanta as a labor organizer for the Unemployment Council. His involvement with the Communist Party brought him national prominence after he was arrested in Atlanta, convicted of insurrection, and his case twice reached the US Supreme Court on appeal. He campaigned to organize working-class blacks and whites to become politically active. He solicited blacks and whites alike for membership in an integrated Communist Party of Atlanta. Brown-Nagin, Courage to Dissent (2011), p. 285. Nearly 1,000 unemployed workers, both black and white, demonstrated at the federal courthouse on June 30, 1932, seeking resumption of relief payments. Officials were alarmed that the protest was biracial, as it crossed the segregated lines of the Jim Crow South. They began to monitor known and suspected radicals, even as the city became more crowded with rural migrants. On July 11, Herndon checked on his mail at the Post Office and was arrested by two Atlanta police detectives. A few days later his hotel room was searched, and Communist Party publications were found. Herndon was charged with insurrection under a Georgia Reconstruction era law. He was held for nearly six months in jail and was released on Christmas Eve, after his bail of $7,000 was paid by the International Labor Defense, a legal organization affiliated with the Communist Party USA.\\"Black Red Freed\\", Time, May 3, 1937. An all-white jury found Herndon guilty at trial on January 18, 1933. Hired by the ILD, his young attorneys were Benjamin J. Davis Jr. and John H. Geer. The International Juridical Association provided support by reviewing their brief for Herndon. Herndon was sentenced to 18 to 20 years of hard labor \\"on the chain gang.\\" On December 7, 1935, Herndon's conviction was overturned by the state appeals court and he was released on bail.John Hammond Moore. \\"The Angelo Herndon Case.\\" Pylon 32:1 (1971), p. 64. After the Georgia Supreme Court upheld his original conviction, Herndon went on a national speaking tour in 1936 to promote his case while his defense appealed it to the Supreme Court. He appeared before crowds in Denver, Colorado; Topeka, Kansas; and Kansas City, Missouri.\\"Angelo Herndon Here Sunday.\\" Plaindealer XXXVIII:51 (December 18, 1936), p. 1. On April 26, 1937, a narrow five-to-four majority of the United States Supreme Court ruled in Herndon's favor, striking down Georgia's insurrection statute as unconstitutional, as it violated the First Amendment, which protects individual's right to free speech and the right of assembly.. Herndon was greeted as a hero by a crowd of 6,000 well-wishers when he returned by train to Pennsylvania Station in New York City. Several leading Communist Party officials were on hand to welcome him.\\"Angelo Herndon Comes Back from Georgia, August 1937.\\", Library of Congress On October 13, 1937 Angelo's brother Milton was killed fighting for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Like Angelo, Milton was a Communist Party member. Milton had sought to use his previous experience as a National Guard while in Spain. In the 1940s, Herndon founded the Negro Publication Society of America, which published the radical African-American newspaper The People's Advocate in San Francisco, California, among other works. But by the end of the 1940s, Herndon left the Party. He moved to the Midwest, where he lived quietly and worked as a salesman.Edward A.

When people talk, there are purposes in three separable parts of utterances, the act of speech, the propositional content and the thematic structure. Because speaking is cooperative, in order that the speaking can be effective in the conversation, speakers have to pay attention to their listeners‚Äô knowledge, state of mind and level of understanding. Speakers can assume that listeners know or do not know what speakers are talking about. According to Michael Halliday, the speakers‚Äô judgements about the listeners‚Äô current mental states are reflected in what is called the thematic structure used. The thematic structure has three main functions: *To convey given information and new information *To subject and predicate *To frame and insert A thematic structure is a preoccupying conception of a proposition which runs throughout a media text, usually around an initiating topic.

According to some sources, he named Mysore Radio station \\"Akashavani\\" while working for Gopalan. Narayana Kasturi translated the famous Malayalam novel Chemmeen into Kannada. N Kasturi (sometimes referred to as Na. Kasturi) was a regular contributor to the Koravanji. Koravanji, which he began on Ugadi Day in 1942, enjoyed a circulation of nearly two lakh (two hundred thousand).

Often, the inside of the building was converted by putting in chairs and a makeshift pulpit. The storefront church sometimes serves as a hub for many poor African Americans to see leadership in an all black area. Many storefronts emerged in the urban centers of the north and were filled with poor former slaves leaving the harsh memories of their former lives behind. Storefront churches are a center of social development and free speech in many poor African American communities to express their feelings about the struggles and hardships they faced every day in their lives. They also can provide a focus point for community unity and engagement. Storefronts are still very much a part of the Black church experience today; furthermore, the storefront church has also emerged within other cultures. A PBS report said ‚ÄúStorefront churches today are not just black and urban.

It is named after the Saints John the Evangelist and Petronius, who are patrons of the city of Bologna. This church was made the \\"national church\\" of the Bolognese in Rome in 1581, by order of Pope Gregory XIII. It is located in the Rione of Regola, on Via del Mascherone, across the street and just south of the Gardens behind the Palazzo Farnese. Mention of a parish church on the site was mentioned by 1186, and it was attached to the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso. At the Time it had a name of Sanctae Thomae de Yspanis (of Spain), and later San Tommaso dei Muratori, or della Catena, or dei Frati. The church was in disrepair, when Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, commissioned the Bolognese architect Ottaviano Mascherino to rebuild it as the national church of his countrymen. An adjacent oratory was built in 1601, but later razed. The facade was rebuilt in the late 17th century. The church property was once expropriated but returned to the church in 1940. Most of the artists originally decorating the church were Bolognese, but many of the paintings were removed and some are lost. The painting to the right of the altar about the Transit of St Joseph was painted by Francesco Gessi, while the painting of Santa Caterina da Bologna (now lost) was painted by Giovanni Giuseppe dal Sole. The main altarpiece with a Virgin, Baby Jesus, and Saints John the Evangelist and Petronio was painted by Domenichino; it is now in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini of Rome. The missing altarpieces are replaced by works from unattributed artists. The tomb of Alessandro Algardi was destroyed. The virtues frescoed on the pennants were by Pompeo Aldrovandini.

It was important to the flowering of the Harlem Renaissance and initially promoted a socialist political view. The Messenger was co-founded in New York City by Chandler Owen and A. Philip Randolph in August 1917. After 1920, The Messenger featured more articles about black culture and began to publish rising black writers. It became a kind of literary magazine (like The Little Review, the revived The Dial, and The Liberator), contributing to the Harlem Renaissance. It was notable for helping strengthen African-American intellectual and political identity in the age of Jim Crow.Adam McKible, The Space and Place of Modernism: The Little Magazine in New York, New York: Routledge, 2002. Through the 1920s it also noted the success of blacks who were reaching the middle class in business and the professions, publishing a series of essays known as \\"These 'Colored' United States\\", submitted by writers across the country. History Toward the end of 1916, A. Philip Randolph and Chandler Owen dropped out of college, joined the Socialist Party, and gave soapbox orations on street corners around Harlem. Their socialist and labor union propagandizing gained them celebrity in the area. When they walked into the office building at 486 Lenox Avenue, while looking for a meeting space for their Independent Political Council, they were recognized by William White, President of the Headwaiters and Sidewaiters Society of Greater New York. He suggested they move into his society's headquarters and edit a monthly magazine for waiters. From January until August 1917, Randolph and Owen published the Hotel Messenger. But their expos√© of union corruption (wherein the headwaiters were selling uniforms to sidewaiters at high prices and pocketing the kickbacks from uniform dealers) resulted in their immediate dismissal. They moved into an office next door at 513 Lenox Avenue. With the patronage of Randolph's wife Lucille, they launched The Messenger. The first issue cost 15 cents (its price would never change) and ran the mission statement written by Randolph and Owen: :\\"Our aim is to appeal to reason, to lift our pens above the cringing demagogy of the times, and above the cheap peanut politics of the old reactionary Negro leaders. [This was a reference to Booker T. Washington, who promoted rural skills and compromise at Tuskegee Institute.] Patriotism has no appeal to us; justice has. Party has no weight with us; principle has. Loyalty is meaningless; it depends on what one is loyal to. Prayer is not one of our remedies; it depends on what one is praying for. We consider prayer as nothing more than a fervent wish; consequently the merit and worth of a prayer depend upon what the fervent wish is\\".The Messenger, Spartacus Declaring that \\"with us, economics and politics take precedence to music and art\\", the magazine's first two years were primarily devoted to advocating black labor unionism and socialism, and denouncing the War and its effects on black Americans. The magazine attacked President Woodrow Wilson's call to make \\"the world safe for democracy\\", when the black community was at risk in the U.S. Since the late 19th century, it had suffered a high rate of lynchings and violence in the South. At the turn of the century, most blacks were disenfranchised by changes in state law across the region that raised barriers to voter registration. They were excluded from the political system. The editors of the Messenger also criticized major northern black figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who was pro-war at the time, and Marcus Garvey, an activist from Jamaica. They believed that Garvey's program to \\"repatriate\\" native-born American black citizens to Africa was illogical and far fetched. The Messenger declared: > \\"No intelligent Negro is willing to lay down his life for the United States > as it now exists. Intelligent Negroes have now reached the point where their > support of the country is conditional\\". Such statements led to Justice Department agents ransacking the Messenger's editorial office in the dead of night, breaking furniture and confiscating back issues. Randolph and Owen conducted a public speaking tour against the war, appearing in Chicago and Cleveland, while selling copies of their fiery July 1918 issue. Reaching Cleveland on 4 August, Randolph and Owen took turns addressing the mass meeting gathered by the city's Socialist Party leader Walter Bronstrup. He sold issues of the Messenger in the crowd until an undercover Justice Department official bought an issue and broke up the meeting. The DOJ official pulled Randolph from the stage, arrested him and Owen, and held them the following day for investigation. Randolph and Owen were held for trial under charges of violating the Espionage Act by: > \\"unlawfully, knowingly and feloniously, the United States being then and > there at war with the Imperial German Government, willfully print and cause > to be printed, publish and cause to be published, circulated, in a certain > language intended to incite, provoke and incur resistance to the United > States and to promote the cause of its enemies in a certain publication > known as the Messenger.‚ÄùJervis Anderson, A. Philip Randolph: A Biographical > Portrait, New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1973, p. 107. After two days in jail, the two men were brought to trial. The judge, looking at the two men and what they had written, said that he could not believe they were old enough, or, being black, smart enough to write that \\"red-hot stuff\\". He did not doubt that they were being used by white socialists who had written the editorials for them. He said there would be no trial and ordered Randolph and Owen returned to their parents' homes; telling them to leave town quickly. The men continued their tour. When they returned to New York, they learned that the Postmaster General Albert Burleson had denied second-class mailing privileges to their magazine because of its content. Socialism failed to attract followers in Harlem. By February 1920 the Messenger identified as \\"A Journal of Scientific Radicalism;‚Äù in June 1923, it billed itself as \\"The World‚Äôs Greatest Negro Monthly\\". It published increasing amounts of poetry, stories, and other work of Harlem intellectuals as the area became the center for black culture. Although lacking a literary editor, The Messenger was influential in the Harlem Renaissance; it published a range of new writers before they had reached literary reputations. Theophilus Lewis, the magazine's drama critic from September 1923 till May 1926, supported the African-American little theatre movement, and helped develop a black aesthetic in the theater. Lewis may have been untrained and was not paid for his contributions (apparently the Messenger offices paid only for his cab fare to and from shows), but his enthusiasm for the theater led to well-developed criticism. He helped shape African-American theater on many levels, from the little theaters to Broadway. Lewis helped recruit Wallace Thurman to the magazine as a contributing editor. He later founded the influential magazine Fire!! Thurman worked at The Messenger from late 1925 to 1926 and helped to publish Zora Neale Hurston's \\"Eatonville Anthology\\", as well as the early stories of Langston Hughes (Hurston and Hughes joined Thurman as an editors of Fire!!). Thurman also became known for his novels The Blacker the Berry and Infants of Spring. George S. Schuyler, a staple of the magazine for his satiric column \\"Shafts and Darts\\" (which he sometimes wrote with help from Lewis), contributed the piece \\"Hobohemia\\" to the Messenger. He became a correspondent and Chief Editorial Writer for the Pittsburgh Courier. Schuyler earned some renown for his satirical novel Black No More. While the magazine was based in Harlem, its essays from the 1920s onward took a look at black culture across the whole nation with contributors such as Schuyler, Thurman, Lewis, E. Franklin Frazier and others (see: Tom Lutz and Susanna Ashton's edited collection of a series of essays from this period known as \\"These 'Colored' United States\\"). In 2004, Adam McKible \\"discovered\\" and helped reprint Edward Christopher Williams‚Äô anonymously published serialized novel, The Letters of Davy Carr. Republished as When Washington Was in Vogue, Williams' book is a slyly humorous and culturally critical epistolary novel following members of the black bourgeoisie in 1920s Washington, D.C. Other contributors of note include Arna Bontemps, who later wrote Story of the Negro, and Claude McKay, whose poem, \\"If We Must Die\\", was reprinted in the Messenger as an anti- lynching, pro-self-defense statement to all African-Americans. The magazine was always in such debt that it did not publish at all during some months where coeditors were on fundraising lecture tours. Contributors received only token payments. Money problems forced the magazine to change offices after being evicted from its first base. They were evicted again after three years, and leased space at 2311 Seventh Avenue. It published from there until folding in 1928 from lack of funds. Social influence In addition to providing a platform for African-American literature, The Messenger published much political writing. Randolph also served as editor for The Socialist magazine. Writers published in The Messenger tackled issues which other journals and magazines avoided. The Messenger was notable for its critical perspective during the Harlem Renaissance. It was described as \\"The most feared black publication\\" during its reigning era from 1917 until 1928. Randolph and his wife Lucille ran for secretary of state and the state legislature of New York on the Socialist ticket in 1917. The January issue of 1918 supported Bolshevism in Russia after its revolution. The Messenger became a voice for those who were oppressed socially and economically. Many people would have suffered injustice for a longer period of time had it not been for The Messenger. For eleven years, it paved the way for social justice and equality. It was respected by many. Its influence was also described in 1919 by the U.S. Justice Department: \\"the most able and the most dangerous of all Negro publications.\\".A. Philip Randolph Messenger Awards Randolph and Owen did not believe that blacks should participate in the Great War because they did not have political equality in the United States. When questioned on his views, Randolph wrote what he described as a \\"satirical and sarcastic\\" response.Messenger, July 1928, p. 13. A. Philip Randolph and or Chandler Owen to Frederick G. Detweiler, 19 March 1921, in Frederick G. Detweiler, The Negro Press in the United States (Chicago, 1922), p. 171. He wrote: > \\"the Negro may be choosing between being burnt by Tennessee, Georgia or > Texas mobs or being shot by Germans in Belgium. We don't know about this > pro-Germanism among Negroes. It may be only their anti-Americanism -meaning > anti-lynching.\\"Theodore Kornweibel, Jr., Seeing Red, Bloomington, IN: > Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 78. \\"Garvey Must Go\\" campaign The Messenger openly critiqued Marcus Mosiah Garvey's theory of Black Nationalism. Garvey had immigrated from Jamaica. His pan-African approach promoted the \\"return\\" of [blacks] from the United States and the Caribbean, to \\"go back to Africa, and more basically, back to their own blackness\\".Kornweibel, Theodore, Jr, \\"The 'Garvey Must Go' Campaign\\", in No Crystal Stair: Black Life and the Messenger, 1917‚Äì1928, Westport, CN: Greenwood, 1975, p. 161. Randolph and Owen criticized Garvey's goal of re- populating the African continent solely with blacks and his promotion of the idea in the United States. \\"Even the Senegalese French Deputy, Blaise Diagne, agreed that Africa was too diverse and fragmented for Garvey‚Äôs black Zionism to be realized\\".Kornweibel, 162. Instead, the editors wanted to present \\"the possibilities of an American future devoid of lynching and Jim Crow, discrimination and prejudice\\".Kornweibel, p. 160. They believed that Garvey's ideas diverted African Americans from working on current racial issues and change in the United States. Randolph and Owen started the \\"Garvey Must Go\\" campaign in 1922, with the goal of getting Garvey deported. This appeared to contradict their original mission statement. \\"Chandler Owen explained that historically radicals had opposed deportation only in cases of expression of political or class war opinions\\".Kornweibel, p. 139. Garvey and the editors of The Messenger represented competing strains of thought among African-American leaders in Harlem and the United States. In the small world of Harlem, Garvey rented offices for his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in the same building as those of The Messenger. Randolph and Owen continued to criticize Garvey. In the September 1922 issue, they described Garvey as a tool of the recently revived Ku Klux Klan (KKK), saying he was \\"the chief hat-in- hand, me-too-boss 'good nigger' puppet of the Ku Klux Klan Kleagle, Edward Young Clarke of Georgia.‚Äù\\"United Front Against Ku Klux Klan\\". Messenger, September 1922. 478. Business era During the 1920s, the Messenger also published a series of essays known as \\"These 'Colored' United States\\", from January 1923 through September 1926.McKible (2013), p. 39 Articles were submitted by writers from across the nation, reporting on the rise of middle- class blacks in business and the professions. One such article was published in 1924 by T. Gillis Nutter, an attorney and former state representative of West Virginia (1918‚Äì1920), elected at a time when most blacks had been closed out of statewide office by disenfranchisement across the South at the turn of the century. He reported on 28 successful men and women in business, the professions and teaching, as well as crops produced by black farmers in the state, and other property held by them.Adam McKible, The Space and Place of Modernism: The Little Magazine in New York, New York: Routledge, 2013, p.47 Further reading * Jervis Anderson, A.

It serves as a , two-lane alternate route of NY 85 through the town of New Scotland, running from the hamlet of New Salem to the hamlet of New Scotland. While NY 85 bypasses the village of Voorheesville to the south, NY 85A directly serves it, connecting to two state routes inside of the village limits. The route was assigned to its current alignment. Route description NY 85A eastbound at the junction with NY 155 in Voorheesville. The \\"North\\" above the NY 155 shield should say \\"East\\". NY 85A begins at an intersection with NY 85 in the hamlet of New Salem, located in the northwestern portion of the town of New Scotland. It heads northward from the site of the Punkintown Fair as New Salem Road, leaving New Salem for slightly more open areas north of the hamlet. Development along the route remains high, however, as the two-lane road passes by several residential street and serves Clayton A. Bouton High School. About north of New Salem, the route makes a sharp turn to the east, running by another line of homes on its way into the village of Voorheesville. Inside the village, NY 85A becomes known as Helderberg Parkway. As it approaches the center of the village, NY 85A serves Voorheesville Elementary School and meets the eastern end of NY 156\\\\. While NY 156 heads northwest out of the village on Altamont Road, NY 85A continues east through Voorheesville's commercial and residential center on Maple Avenue. Along the way, the route passes by a village park and passes under the CSX Transportation-owned Selkirk Subdivision rail line. On the eastern fringe of the village, the route connects to the western terminus of NY 155 by way of a roundabout. Now under the name Maple Road, NY 85A heads southeast from the village, connecting to several housing tracts and passing by Colonie Country Club. Roughly from NY 155, the highway turns due southward, traversing open fields to return to NY 85 at a junction east of the hamlet of New Scotland. History The entirety of modern NY 85A was taken over by the state of New York by 1926 and designated as NY 85A . East of Voorheesville, NY 85A was originally concurrent with NY 156 to NY 85, where both routes ended. The overlap between the two routes was eliminated when NY 156 was truncated to Voorheesville at some point between 1950 and 1965.

Soriano (born 10 December 1950) is a Bishop of the United Methodist Church, elected in 2000 in the Philippines. Early life Leo is the second son of Benjamin Soriano, a Methodist Pastor, and Purificacion Aranda, a teacher. He has two brothers, Henry and Bliss and a sister, Phoebe. He was born and spent his early childhood in Binalonan, Pangasinan. His family moved to Cagayan de Oro where he spent his teenage years. Growing up in Mindanao, he became an active member of the Methodist Youth Fellowship. His early involvement in church activities would later influence him to entin different college activities and organizations including the ROTC, Glee Club, and university organs. He finished his Bachelor of Science degree with flying colors. His Bachelor of Science degree inclined him to pursue a degree in medicine but Leo has another calling. He instead went to Manila and studied in seminary. He met his wife, Dania, while in seminary. They married in 1977. They have four children: Hesed, Nezer, Omar and Ronald. Medical Missionary He started his ministry after graduating cum laude from the Union Theological Seminary in the Philippines. While raising a family, Leo studied and earned a doctor of medicine degree from the Davao Medical School Foundation. Despite the many opportunities of earning big as a doctor, Leo chose to answer God's call to bring the good news and fullness of life to the deprived, underserved and underprivileged. He was appointed as Doctor in Mission for the Medical Mobile Clinic of the Mindanao Annual Conference. This position led him to work in the underserved and far-flung villages and mountains in the war-torn area of Mindanao and Visayas. He served as a missionary doctor from 1989 until the late 1990s. Leo faithfully fulfilled his call despite the danger of being caught in the crossfire between the rebels and military and the difficulty of travelling three days by horseback riding, crossing rivers by bamboo barge and climbing mountains by foot. He reached out to the hundreds of ethnic groups and underserved communities in the provinces of Cotabato, Davao, Leyte, Samar, Sultan Kudarat, Zamboanga and even in Palawan. When Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1992, he was there serving the ethnic groups (Aetas) of Zambales. He pioneered in giving medical care to these people who have not seen a doctor in their whole life. He genuinely served the underprivileged for more than a decade without the fanfare of the media and away from the limelight. He held that position until the project funded by the U.M. General Board of Global Ministries changed it to a Community-based Primary Health Care Program. Episcopal Ministry Leo Soriano was elected as Bishop on the 5th ballot during the 2000 Philippines Central Conference held in Cabanatuan City, Philippines. The overwhelming support and his early election in the 5th Ballot was phenomenal and unprecedented in the history of the United Methodist Church in the Philippines. His election was an indication of the Filipino Methodists desire of change in their church politics. The personal background of Leo, having family roots from the North of the country yet living and representing the South, became a symbol of the desire of the Church to be all-inclusive and intentional in representing equally all ethnic groups of the country. He served as the Resident Bishop of the Davao episcopal area, one of three episcopal areas of the Philippines, for 12 years (2000-2012). His offices were in the Spottswood Methodist Center in Kidapawan City. In 2004 he was appointed to a four-year position as one of four voting members of the General Council on Finance and Administration of the United Methodist Church,. He has served as a member of the UMC Council of Bishops, the UMC General Council on Ministries, and the cross denominational organisations Christian Conference of Asia and National Council of Churches in the Philippines. serves on the Philippine Christian University Board of Trustees. He has acted as a spokesperson for UMC Philippines during the December 2003 typhoons and Southern Leyte mudslides and signing a Bible sent to President George W. Bush as congratulations following his re-election, a 200-year-old UMC tradition. On November 24, 2008, Bishop Soriano was re-elected for a third term as Bishop of the United Methodist Church and was reassigned to Davao Episcopal Area. Bishop Soriano retired from active service in December 2012 during the Philippine Central Conference of the UMC held in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.http://www.pcc- umc.org As he was to retire during that conference, he delivered the Episcopal Address as was the tradition in the UMC. He was given a tribute and a retirement service during the said conference. Post-Episcopacy Bishop Soriano teaches at the Southern Philippines Methodist Colleges in Kidapawan, North Cotabato and the Bishop Han Theological Seminary in Bukidnon. He mentors aspiring pastors from different Christian traditions and denominations on practical ministry. Using his medical background and pastoral experience, he designed a special course with his son Nezer entitle Intro to Health Ministry that teaches young pastors and students about Wesley's emphasis on holistic ministry to the physical body, soul and the environment. Bishop Soriano also teaches Intro to Old Testament. Advocacy Bishop Soriano is one of the Filipino bishops that support an autonomous, affiliated relationship with the United Methodist Church. His election is an overwhelming indication of the desire of the Filipino Methodist to be led by leaders who will move the Filipino United Methodist Church a step closer to becoming autonomous. Bishop Soriano have been actively working in the grassroots level to listen to the voices of the local churches and hear their sentiments about autonomy, church growth, and other church issues. Being the Bishop of Mindanao, Bishop Soriano has been advocating for a harmonious living relationship among Christians and Muslims. The Bishop's office of the Davao Episcopal Area has been actively involved in the Christian-Muslim Dialogue that seeks to find ways and means to achieve peace in Mindanao.

The process may be divided into several separate steps performed in the following order: # Cleaning the record, to prevent unwanted audio artifacts from being introduced in the capture that will necessitate correction in the digital domain (e.g. transient surface noise caused by dirt), and to prevent unnecessary wear and damage to the stylus used in playback. # Transcription of the record to another format on another medium (generally a digital format such as a wav file on a computer); # Processing the raw sound file with software in order to remove transient noise resulting from record surface damage (clicks, pops, and crackle cause by surface scratches and wear); # Using software to adjust the volume and equalization; # Processing the audio with digital and analogue techniques to reduce surface/wideband noise; # Saving the file in the desired format (WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.). The source of the information for these steps is available from various websites and the help files for the software employed in the process. Record cleaning The first step involves cleaning the playing surface of the records (unless they have been stored in archival, dust-free conditions since they were last cleaned). This can involve anything from turntable-based, vacuum equipped, professional cleaning machines that use proprietary chemical formulations and cost four figures, to improvised methods involving home-made equipment and/or cleaning solutions consisting of isopropyl alcohol, distilled water (unpurified tap water should not be used, as it will probably leave limescale deposits on the record surface) and a surfactant to aid drying. Isopropyl alcohol should only be used to clean vinyl records: it will cause permanent damage to shellac, master and one-time recordings (acetate, wax and lacquer). Hardware The second step involves transcription of a record using a suitable turntable and a suitable cartridge- stylus combination. More often than not, a magnetic cartridge and stylus combination is used because of its superior sound characteristics and signal- to-noise ratio over other pickup systems. The output of a magnetic cartridge is of a very low volume (typically ~5mV) so the signal must be amplified with a preamplifier to bring it up to line level before being routed into the line- in jack of a computer's sound card. Sound cards made specifically for digitally recording vinyl (as well as those designed for DJing with timecode vinyl) have phono preamplifiers built in, eliminating the need for two separate devices. Three main types of phono-preamplifier exist for the process of record restoration and playback: * those that apply RIAA equalization or RIAA de-emphasis on playback to counteract the equalization used when the recording was originally made. These are generally not suitable for 78rpm records and early microgroove recordings. * those that include a switchable frequency turnover filter to match the various turnover frequencies used by the many record manufacturers between 1925 and ~1960. * those that apply no equalization (also called \\"Flat\\" phonopreamplifiers). These require audio software to apply the correct equalization to the digital recording during the restoration process. As such, this type of premplifier is suitable for all record formats regardless of equalization employed by the mastering process. Regardless of the preamplifier employed, one must ensure that the output volume is not set too high when recording through the sound card, or digital clipping may result. A low average volume can easily be corrected later on during editing (although with some loss in dynamic range) - however, too low a volume setting can result in greater amount of noise (especially the inherent sound-card or system noise) relative to the usable audio and this noise will become prominent at the time of normalisation of the audio. Ideally, the VU meter should not exceed around -2 or -3 dB to allow for some signal headroom. However, some clipping due to transient responses caused by scratches or cracked records are usually acceptable since these are extremely small in width and do not usually cause any audible difference. One must also be sure that all equipment is grounded appropriately together, or subtle hums will likely result from the formation of ground loops. Similarly, the computer should have sufficient power and memory to record an entire record without any \\"drop-outs\\"-- (tiny gaps in the audio stream lasting just a fraction of a second).Diamond Cut Live/Forensics Audio Laboratory v.7.5 Users Manual, Thirteenth Edition, 1st Printing Software The software used to process the resulting digital files ranges in price from thousands of dollars to freeware. Some of these applications are simple, and some are very complex. Many are general purpose waveform editors that also happen to include record restoration features or plugins, and others are dedicated to the sole purpose of record restoration. Moreover, some applications are designed for easy fast processing with the push of a few buttons, and others require a time-consuming but perhaps more exact manual approach to editing out damage. Most applications present a waveform display, but a few are basically noise and click-pop filters that provide no visual display at all. All record restoration applications for Windows work directly upon WAV files, but a few will also directly open files in other formats, such as MP3. Record restoration software normally handles two different categories of noise separately. First, there is the constant background noise that goes on through the entire recording that is the result of the sound the stylus makes in the groove when no music is playing, plus whatever subtle drones are generated by the electronics involved (such as turntable rumble or 50/60 cycle hum). In addition to band-stop filters (also known as \\"notch filters\\"), low-pass filters, and high-pass filters for filtering out hum and noise, many applications allow the user to take a \\"noiseprint\\" of a small section of waveform when the stylus is tracking but no music is playing; the filtering is then accomplished specific to this noiseprint. Second, there are the transient bursts of damage, mostly clicks and pops, caused by scratches or record defects, and crackle caused by many minute defects grouped close together. The software must filter this kind of click-pop damage conservatively, because a click or a pop can look very much like a legitimate percussive effect, such as a light snare drum rim-shot. If the automatic filtering software is getting every last click, chances are good that it could also be filtering some percussion instruments. After an automatic click filtering, it is reasonable to expect a few clicks to be left over, and these must be removed manually by isolating them one-by-one in the waveform. These residual clicks may then be corrected by attenuation (reducing or muting the volume of the anomaly), interpolation (replacing the waveform \\"spike\\" with a less offensive section, either a straight line‚Äîlinear interpolation‚Äîor a calculated facsimile deduced from what the wave looks like on either side); substitution (replacing a damaged waveform segment with a similar section from elsewhere); channel substitution (where damage occurring in only one channel of a stereo waveform is replaced by a similar good segment in the other channel); and simple deletion, which is usually not noticeable for small samples. Some applications also have a \\"pencil tool\\" with which one can actually redraw the waveform. Volume and equalization After the noise and clicks and pops have been removed, one may adjust the volume. This is usually done by a process called audio normalization whereby the loudest tone in a track is amplified right up to some specified point, usually the point of digital clipping, and the rest of the waveform is amplified accordingly. In another form of amplification called \\"hard limiting,\\" the loudest passages are attenuated drastically after they hit a certain limit, while the quieter passages are amplified. The result is a compressed waveform that sounds considerably louder, though it may not be what the original recording engineers intended. In all of these volume adjustments, one should respect the original dynamics of a piece, and of the variation in dynamics among different tracks in the same LP. In addition to adjusting the volume, at this point one may desire to adjust the frequency profile of a piece with the \\"graphic equalizer\\" that is normally supplied with a wave editor. Some might feel that a track needs a slight treble boost, or reduction, or a big boost in the bass department. One should satisfy one's own perception of what sounds best for any particular track. An application usually lets you \\"preview\\" a piece before applying the equalization effects. Export and save After all this is done, the file (or files) are ready to export (or save) in whatever form the user desires. Almost all wave editing applications have the default ability to save files in WAV form, and some can also save files as MP3, FLAC, or in other formats. Many CD-R burning applications can then take these files and burn them onto a blank recordable disc in a form that can be played on a common CD player (using the standard CD-DA format).  Preservation  Each medium - including digital media - has benefits and drawbacks and over the long term, vinyl records may even have advantages over digital media. Due to the nature of the medium, playback of \\"hard\\" records, e.g.: LPs, causes gradual degradation of the recording. CDs, however, can also have degradation due to \\"CD rot\\" and other abnormalities. CDs' shelf life has been disputed as to whether it is to be the equivalent of vinyl- which actually can last for years of playback. CDs also can have shortcomings such as skips and clicks. This is due to problems with the laser reading the discs. On the other hand, a vinyl record will play under most any circumstance because it is an analog medium. The recordings are best preserved by transferring them onto more stable media and playing the records as rarely as possible. They need to be stored on edge, and do best under environmental conditions that most humans would find comfortable. The medium needs to be kept clean ‚Äî but alcohol should only be used on PVC or optical media, not on 78s. The equipment for playback of certain formats (e.g. 16 and 78 rpm) is manufactured only in small quantities, leading to increased difficulty in finding equipment to play the recordings. (This \\"gradual degradation\\" is more noticeable on some discs than others. In fact it is possible to have eighty- year-old records that sound as new as brand new discs with pops and tics. How the records are handled and the equipment on which they are played as well as the manufacturing process and quality of original vinyl have a considerable impact upon their wear.) Where old disc recordings are considered to be of artistic or historic interest, record companies or archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format which can be copied and converted without any further damage to the recording. For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record playerPrima Voce. Nimbus Records, Accessed 2 November 2006. to transfer 78s. However, anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer. Once a recording has been digitized, it can be manipulated with software to restore and, hopefully, improve the sound, for example by removing the result of scratches. It can also be easily converted to other digital formats such as DVD-A, CD and MP3. As an alternative to playback with a stylus, a recording can be read optically, processed with software that calculates the velocity that the stylus would be moving in the mapped grooves and converted to a digital recording format. This does no further damage to the disc and generally produces a better sound than normal playback. This technique also has the potential to allow for reconstruction of damaged or broken disks. With regard to inner sleeves, plastic polyethylene is purported to be better than the common paper sleeve and less bulky than the poly-lined paper variety. Paper sleeves deteriorate over time, leave dusty fibers, and produce static that attract dust. 100% poly sleeves produce less static (thereby attracting less dust), are archival, and are thinner by nature so they minimize pressure on the LP jacket seams.

He served as Marshal of France from 1641, Viceroy of Navarre and B√©arn, and Governor of Bayonne. Life and career Antoine de Gramont came from an old southern French noble family. His father was Antoine II de Gramont, and his mother was Louise de Roquelaure (d. 1610), daughter of Marshal Roquelaure (1544‚Äì1625). He had a younger half-brother, Philibert de Gramont, from their father's second marriage to Claude de Montmorency. Gramont was a loyal supporter of Richelieu. It is said that he once toasted to Richelieu saying that the cardinal was more important to him than the king and the entire royal family. Gramont took part in many battles of the Thirty Years War, was promoted to Marshal of France on 22 September 1641, and obtained the title of Duke of Gramont in 1648 for himself and his heirs. He became minister in 1653, ambassador to the Reichstag in Frankfurt am Main in 1657, and was sent to Spain in 1660 to ask the hand in marriage of Maria Theresa of Spain for Louis XIV. He died in 1678. His memoirs (\\"M√©moires du mar√©chal de Gramont\\", Paris 1716) were published by his son Antoine Charles IV de Gramont. In literature As the Comte de Guiche, he is a major character in Edmond Rostand's 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, where he is depicted at first as vain, lustful, and opportunistic. He is infatuated with Roxane, the heroine of the play, and tries to arrange her marriage to the Vicomte de Valvert as a \\"front\\" in order that he (the Count) may become her secret lover. When Cyrano kills Valvert in a duel, De Guiche becomes more open in his desires and tries to arrange his own marriage to her. After he is thwarted by Cyrano long enough for her to be able to marry her sweetheart Christian de Neuvillette, he vengefully sends both Christian and Cyrano to do battle at the 1640 Siege of Arras, in which Christian is killed. At Arras, however, de Guiche shows gallantry toward Roxane and a willingness to sacrifice his life to protect her after she arrives at the battlements. In doing this, he wins Cyrano's respect, and later becomes one of his most loyal friends. He is last seen warning Roxane of a plot to kill Cyrano - a plot which unfortunately succeeds.http://www.cyranodebergerac.fr/roxane_autres_contenu.php?contenu_id=5  Family  His younger half-brother was Philibert, comte de Gramont (1621‚Äì1707), renowned for his memoirs describing the love affairs of the English court of Charles II, edited by Antoine Hamilton. In 1634, he married Richelieu's niece, Fran√ßoise-Marguerite du Plessis de Chivr√© (1608‚Äì1689). They had four children: *Guy Armand, comte de Guiche, (1637 ‚Äì 29 November 1673, rumored lover of both Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans and his wife Henrietta of England, duchess of Orleans. Predeceased his father and is thus known to history by the subsidiary title of comte de Guiche. *Catherine-Charlotte (1639‚Äì1678), Princess of Monaco and mistress of Louis XIV of France. *Antoine Charles (1641‚Äì1720), Viceroy of Navarre; succeeded his father as Duke of Gramont etc. *Henriette-Catherine, married Alexandre de Canonville, marquis de Raffetot.  Royal origin  According to Count Philibert de Gramont, their father, Antoine II de Gramont, viceroy of Navarre, was assumed to be a bastard child of king Henry IV by Diane d'Andoins, knowns as \\"La Belle Corisande\\". This has been challenged by some modern historians.Raymond Ritter (French article) in Une dame de chevalerie, Corisande d'Andoins, comtesse de Guiche (A lady of chivalry, Corisande of Andoins, Countess of Guiche) (1959) shows that this was her son by Philibert, and her affair with the king was childless. Diane's sister-in-law, Catherine, Countess of Lauzun, was the grandmother of the first Duke of Lauzun, the secret husband of la Grande Mademoiselle. Literature * W. H.

It is also known as muscle cocontraction, since two muscle groups are contracting at the same time. It is able to be measured using electromyography (EMG) from the contractions that occur. The general mechanism of it is still widely unknown. It is believed to be important in joint stabilization, as well as general motor control. Coactivation of biceps and triceps. The biceps‚Äô EMG is on top, while the triceps‚Äô EMG is on the bottom.  Function  Muscle coactivation allows muscle groups surrounding a joint to become more stable. This is due to both muscles (or sets of muscles) contracting at the same time, which produces compression on the joint. The joint is able to become stiffer and more stable due to this action. For example, when the bicep and the triceps coactivate, the elbow becomes more stable. This stabilization mechanism is also important for unexpected loads impeded on the joint, allowing the muscles to coactivate and provide stability to the joint in a quick fashion. This mechanism is controlled neuromuscularly, which allows the muscle(s) to contract. This occurs through a motor neuron sending a signal (through creating action potentials) to the muscle fiber to contract by releasing Acetylcholine. When signals are sent to all muscle fibers in a muscle group, the muscle group will contract as a whole. In the upper limbs, the stability of muscle coactivation allows for precise low-level physical tasks. An example of this would be picking up a small object. By protecting the muscles at the end of their range of motion, the direction of the fine movements is able to be changed. In the lower limbs, stability is important in upright standing balance. The coactivation of different muscle groups allows for proper balance and the ability to adjust weight and to stay upright on uneven ground. It is also believed to be important for postural control by stabilizing the spine. Muscle coactivation is absolutely necessary for learning a fine motor skill or for any activity involving stability. In order for muscle coactivation to occur, it must inhibit reciprocal innervation, which occurs when a muscle contracts and the synergist muscle relaxes. For muscle coactivation to occur, both the muscle and synergist muscle need to contract.  Testing  Muscle coactivation is measured using a technique called electromyography(EMG). This is performed by using surface EMG that responds to electrical activity of the muscle through the skin. Electrical activity is only present in the muscle when the muscle voluntarily contracts. When the muscle is contracted, the EMG is able to display the force of the contraction or how the nerves can respond to stimulation. An EMG of coactivation would display the agonist and antagonist muscle contracting simultaneously. Although it is believed many muscles are involved in the mechanism of coactivation, methods to measure coactivation are finite to specific instances or two muscle systems. Because of this, little is understood about the role of coactivation in a multiple muscle system.

It is organized as a not-for-profit educational institute under California state law and is governed by a Board of Trustees. NTPS is one of the seven test pilots schools worldwide recognized by the international Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), giving pilot graduates of NTPS instant initial acceptance into their Society.. In 2016, NTPS became the first test pilot school in the world to be certified as a Flight Test Authorised Training Organisation (ATO) by the European Aviation Safety Organization (EASA). Purpose The mission of the National Test Pilot School is to train test pilots and flight test engineers who will enhance aviation knowledge, increase flight test competency, and improve aviation safety world-wide. This mission is primarily accomplished through the NTPS Professional Courses and Masters Programs that provide graduate level flight test education and training to test pilots and flight test engineers who learn to safely and effectively plan, execute, and report on flight test programs. This mission is further accomplished through NTPS' continuing education short course program, flight test related research programs, and flight test support activities that increase competency, safety, and breadth of knowledge in aviation and flight test professionals. History The NTPS grew out of a successful series of introductory flight test courses taught for military test organizations in the United States and Canada. Using an instrumented De Havilland Dove (DH-104), introductory, two- week performance and flying qualities flight test courses were taught for Edwards AFB, California; Patuxent River NAS, Maryland; Eglin AFB, Florida; the Naval Postgraduate School, California; Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio; and the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment, CFB Cold Lake, Canada. The success of these courses led to opportunities to teach broader content flight test courses abroad. The school was formally established as a not-for-profit educational institute in the state of California in April 1981. The initial years of the school consisted of teaching introductory courses within the United States, mainly for military organizations, and teaching longer courses abroad (in Israel, Taiwan, Brazil and South Africa) using customer aircraft. By 1986, the decision was made to construct a large hangar and classroom complex in Mojave, California. Over the ensuing years more flight test training was done in Mojave with a growing fleet of aircraft, rather than at customer locations. Today the school trains 10‚Äì30 students in year-long courses with approximately 200-300 students attending one of several short courses each year. In 2016 NTPS became the first test pilot school in the world to be certified as a Flight Test Authorised Training Organisation (ATO) by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Today, NTPS trains military and civilian students from over 30 different countries around the world. Courses Professional course The principal course taught at the NTPS is the Professional Course which is certified for EASA Category 1. It is a one-year-long course covering performance, flying qualities and avionics systems. Both test pilots and flight test engineers are trained. Portions of the course are specifically tailored for fixed or rotary wing pilots and engineers. Sub-sets of the professional course, taught in conjunction with professional course students, are offered routinely: # Customers can send students to either the Performance and Flying Qualities (P&FQ;) Professional Course or to the Systems Professional Course, each being approximately six months in length. # The EASA Category 2 Course is the core portion of the P&FQ; curriculum plus some Systems curriculum in a stand-alone course of 20 weeks in duration. # Within the Professional Course the content is divided into modules, nominally 1-3 weeks in duration which can be taken for academic credit. Short courses In addition to the Professional Course the school has nine regularly-scheduled short courses of two to six weeks duration. These include introductory courses in fixed and rotary wing P&FQ;, avionics systems testing, operational test and evaluation, civil certification courses, night vision systems, production flight testing, and a pre-test pilot school course designed as a preparatory course for students planning to attend the challenging twelve-month course. Curriculum The NTPS Professional Course curriculum initially followed the format and flow of the course taught at the US Air Force Test Pilot School. The content was divided among three major components: performance, flying qualities and systems flight testing with the flow of the course always was executed in that sequence. Due to customer feedback that content and sequence were changed in 1999. The majority of the Professional Course students came from foreign military organizations. These organizations generally had need for testing modifications to aircraft rather than testing of entirely new types of aircraft. As a consequence, avionics systems testing became more important and NTPS essentially broke the course into two major components: 1) performance and flying qualities testing, and 2) avionic systems testing. A realization that one component did not, by itself, prepare students for the other component, a course flow was adopted that allowed students to take either half first, or to only take the half that was most relevant to the sponsoring organization. This school schedules avionic systems always in the first half of the year and P&FQ; in the second half. With an introductory module preceding each six month segment students can join a year-long course either in January or July and carry through the entire course or simply stay for the chosen segment. A positive outcome of this approach is that every class has a combination of junior and senior students working together. Degrees In 1995, the NTPS was approved by the State of California to award master‚Äôs degrees in Flight Test and Evaluation. Since 2004, graduates meeting all of the requirements have been eligible for an accredited Master of Science degree in Flight Test Engineering. This degree is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). Staff The NTPS staff is highly experienced, both in flight testing and in instructing. There are approximately 15 full-time instructors and another 10 part-time, contract instructors. The typical instructor is a retired military officer, a graduate of a formal test pilot school, has a master's degree or higher, with over 15 years of flight test experience and 7+ years instructing experience with 5‚Äì10 years employment at the NTPS. Approximately half of the staff are US citizens and half are international. The international backgrounds include Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Israel, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The President and CEO of the school is Dr. Allen (AL) L. Peterson. The Vice- president of the school is Mr. James (JB) Brown. The Chairman of the Board of Trustees is Mr. Tom Morgenfeld. Aircraft The NTPS routinely uses a fleet of 34 aircraft (23 different types) located at the school‚Äôs campus at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California. Seven of the aircraft are owned by the school and the rest are supplied by an adjacent contractor, Flight Research, Inc. The 23 different types are: * Aero L-39 Albatross * Aermacchi MB-326 Impala * Beechcraft Duchess (BE-76) * Airbus EC-145 * Augusta 109A * Bell OH-58 Kiowa * Bell UH-1N Twin Huey * Cessna 150 * Cessna 172 Skyhawk * Cessna 182 Skylane * Beech C-90 King Air * Cirrus SR22 * Diamond DA-42 Twinstar * de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk * Gippsland GA8 Airvan * MBB BO-105 * Mig-21 Fishbed * North American Sabreliner * Northop T-38 Talon * Piper PA-34 Seneca II * Slingsby T67 Firefly * Swearingen Merlin III Additionally, the school leases other, outside aircraft as needed. Professional Course student test pilots typically fly 24 different types of aircraft during their one-year program, including four one-time qualitative evaluations in non-school aircraft after the Performance and Flying Qualities phase. All Professional course students get a final project in an unfamiliar aircraft at the end of their course as a graduation exercise and capstone project for their master's degree.

The first mile (1.6 km) of the route is a four-lane divided highway named Cherry Avenue Extension, while the second mile follows a two-lane street known as Kenwood Avenue. NY 140 initially followed Kenwood Avenue from the center of Slingerlands to Delmar when it was assigned in the mid-1930s; however, the route was altered to bypass Slingerlands in the mid-1970s. Route description NY 140 westbound at CR 52 near Slingerlands NY 140 begins at a roundabout with NY 85 northeast of Slingerlands, a hamlet in the northeastern part of the town of Bethlehem. The highway initially heads southeastward around Slingerlands, following a four-lane divided highway known as Cherry Avenue Extension for roughly through an area of forests. NY 140 intersects two local roads before reaching a four-way junction with Kenwood Avenue. Here, the route turns east onto the two-lane Kenwood Avenue while the divided highway continues southward as County Route 52 (CR 52, named Cherry Avenue). To the west, a town-owned section of Kenwood Avenue directly connects NY 140 to Slingerlands and serves as a shortcut to NY 85 west. The Kenwood Avenue portion of the route heads generally eastward through mostly residential neighborhoods. After , it enters the hamlet of Delmar, a large community built up along NY 443\\\\. In Delmar, the route passes through areas of more commercial nature before terminating at an intersection with NY 443\\\\. The junction is located just from the northern terminus of NY 335, which ends at another junction with NY 443 in nearby Elsmere. History The section of Kenwood Avenue between New Scotland Road (now NY 85) at Slingerlands and Delaware Avenue (NY 443) at Delmar was added to the state highway system on December 13, 1904, as the unsigned State Highway 92. It did not receive a posted designation until the mid-1930s when it was designated as NY 140. The west end of NY 140 was realigned in the mid-1970s to follow Cherry Avenue Extension, a divided highway continuation of Cherry Avenue (CR 52) that bypassed Slingerlands to the northeast. On December 7, 2006, the divided highway portion of NY 140 was ceremoniously designated as the Captain Timothy J. Moshier Memorial Highway. Moshier, a Bethlehem native, was a captain in the United States Army who was killed on April 1, 2006, during the Iraq War.

The Italian Coast Guard discovered the ship with no crew on board. The coast guard boarded the vessel and steered her away from the rocks and shallow waters she was drifting towards. Once aboard, they discovered a half-eaten meal of Egyptian food, French maps of North African seas, a pile of clothes, and a flag of Luxembourg. The ship has been described as a \\"classic style\\" schooner never seen in Italy before. The investigation found that she had never been registered in Italy nor any other country. The only identification aboard the ship was a wooden tablet or \\"plaque\\" as described in some papers that read Bel Amica, a likely misspelling of \\"Beautiful Friend\\" (the phrase should say \\"Bell'Amica\\" to read properly in modern Italian). Shortly after the original reports, Italian newspapers reported the owner of the ship had been found. Franc Rouayrux, from Luxembourg, was identified as the owner of the vessel. The boat had been left anchored in deep water for somewhat nebulous reasons, and Rouayroux stated that he had expected to return to the yacht after returning home to address an emergency. The Italian press suggested that this may have been an attempt to avoid steep taxation of luxury vessels. Many reports at the time identified Bel Amica as a schooner. This term is frequently associated with sailing ships from the pre-steamship era; however, it is simply a technical name for the layout of the sails. Schooners of many sizes are in current production. The misidentification of this modern yacht as an antique ship deepened the mystery and probably contributed to the brief international interest at the time.

Silverio's voice was called ‚Äúthe honey from Alcarria‚Äù.Flamenco History, Part III Biography Silverio Franconetti was born in Seville. His parents were Nicol√°s Franconetti, born in Rome, and Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n Aguilar, born in Alcal√° de Guadaira. He spent his childhood in Mor√≥n de la Frontera, and he learned to be a tailor. He spent time in his youth with the Gypsies who worked in the forges, listening to their songs. He was particularly influenced by one singer named El Fillo. He soon decided to quit his job as tailor and start a career as singer in Seville and then in Madrid. At 25 years of age, he moved to Montevideo, Uruguay where he made a living either as soldier or as picador. He went back to Spain in 1864 to resume his career as singer. He started a partnership with Manuel \\"El Burrero\\" and both opened a caf√© cantante (also called El Burrero). However, their different criteria soon caused them to break apart: while el Burrero prioritized business, for Silverio artistic quality was all. Soon Silverio opened his own caf√©, the \\"Caf√© de Silverio\\", where he invited the most outstanding figures of flamenco of his time, also performing himself regularly. His caf√© gave a definite impulse to the trend of opening caf√©s cantante, which in a few years became numerous in all Andalusia and also in the rest of Spain. Although he was not the creator of the caf√© cantante, he was the first caf√© owner who tried to dignify these venues: > Firstly, through his own artistic personality, giving these schools a > relevance they had not completely achieved [...]. Secondly, dignifying the > genre in contrast with most caf√©s, who admitted artistic elements unrelated > to flamenco, and even the flirts of the public with the women, including, > quite often, the artists themselves. (R√≠os Ruiz 2002) His work Silverio Franconetti with a guitar. As a singer, Silverio was deeply influenced by El Fillo, from whom he learnt most of his repertoire. However, according to traditional flamencology, he radically adapted those songs to his own style. However, it is difficult to attribute any of the existing flamenco forms to his creation. The song known as cabal de Silverio is often thought to be a recreation of the cabal attributed to El Fillo. In spite of the debates about possible attribution, he remains the most famous and discussed singer of his time. His popularization of flamenco through the caf√© cantante was first objected by folklorist Dem√≥filo, who wrote the first biography of Silverio in his book Colecci√≥n de cantes flamencos. According to Dem√≥filo, the spreading of caf√©s cantante would sooner or later debase the nature of the genre in spite of Silverio's intention to keep it pure: > \\"The caf√©s cantantes will soon kill the Gypsy singing style in the near > future, in spite of the giant efforts of the Sevillian singer to rescue it > from the obscure sphere where it lived and which it should never have left > if it were to be kept pure and authentic. When the Gypsy genre went from the > tavern to the caf√©, it received Andalusian influences, and became what > everybody now calls flamenco. Silverio has created the flamenco genre, a > mixture of Gypsy and Andalusian elements. (Quoted by Molina and Mairena > [1963] 1979:31) And Molina and Mairena added: > ... that, as flamenco gained a wider public, the pureness of Gypsy singing > would be weakened, is a fact we have to acknowledge. [...] To make singing > palatable for the masses, [...] he sweetened the elementary harshness of the > abrupt songs from Triana, [...], softening the tragedy of the naked Gypsy > scream into brilliant dramatic melody. [...] Then, he probably started, > wisely, to cultivate flourishings and ornaments to which audiences, > initiated in opera and zarzuela, were sensitive. But still, in Silverio, the > Gypsy echo (so near to him!) was dominant.(Quoted by Molina and Mairena > [1963] 1979:58) Later critics, though, disagree: > However, most critics think just the opposite: that precisely Silverio's > task was dignifying flamenco singing by rescuing it from brothels and > taverns and presenting it with dignity, respect and artistic level.

Corporate function  The majority of UK tour operators are required to hold an ATOL licence, without which they may not legally sell air travel. ATOL- licensed firms will have had their business practices inspected by the CAA. An ATOL licensed tour operator must also obtain insurance bonds from the CAA. The aim of this is to provide refunds to travellers affected by any event which causes the airline to be unable to provide travel for its customers, and to arrange for flights (in addition to accommodation and other items which may be included in a package holiday) to return home those already abroad at the time.  History  In the 1960s, voluntary organisations such as the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) provided a degree of financial protection for air travellers. In 1970, the Federation of Tour Operators (FTO) (then the Tour Operators Study Group) introduced a bonding scheme whereby their members had to obtain bonds to the value of 5% of their annual turnover. In 1972, ABTA followed suit.  Legal requirement  The Civil Aviation Act 1971 established the CAA. Covered under this act was the creation of the original ATOL Regulations. These mandated that all tour operators whose primary mode of transport was by air (but not airlines themselves), must hold an ATOL licence. These regulations came into effect in 1973.  Early practice  On 15 August 1974, the Court Line group collapsed. It was the second largest tour operator at the time and its subsidiaries included Clarksons Holidays, Horizon, and Medvillas. Clarksons Holidays held an ATOL licence and was therefore theoretically covered by its insurance bond. Although the 35,000 customers stranded abroad were successfully repatriated under the scheme, there were insufficient funds for the 100,000 people whose holidays had been paid for in advance. This was a blow to consumer confidence and led to considerable media attention.Civil Aviation Authority History of ATOL A government fund called the Air Travel Trust has since been introduced to pay for any excess which is not covered by ATOL.  Collapse of Thomas Cook  On 23 September 2019 Thomas Cook went into compulsory liquidation, sparking the largest peacetime repatriation in the UK's history. With Thomas Cook being ATOL-protected, the Civil Aviation Authority set about repatriating more than 150,000 British holidaymakers.

The second edition in 1995 was re-named the Complete Omniversal Role Playing System and abandoned the conspiracy setting to focus purely on being a generic role-playing game system. Blacksburg Tactical Research Center ceased creating further materials for the system in 2003. Existing CORPS works are still available as PDFs and via print on demand, but Greg Porter has largely moved on to support his newer generic rules system, EABA.  History  In 1987, Blacksburg Tactical Research Center (\\"BTRC\\") published its first game, Timelords, in which players played characters based upon themselves in a time travel setting. As a time travel/science fiction based game crossing many possible settings, much of the groundwork was already laid for converting the base system into a truly universal RPG, and in fact some players were already using it as a generic game system. In 1992, Blacksburg published a supplement, CORPS Worldbook 1992. In August 2008, Applied Vectors entered into a new contract to create the CORPS Rules Expansion, which included a host of add-ons for the original game, including a bestiary and reprinted material from the original first edition game. Although this was a new contract, it followed an unrealized earlier contract entered into some time before. This was made available in April 2009. In September 2011 Applied Vectors announced a license agreement with BTRC to produce the 3rd edition of the CORPS roleplaying game. This was intended to be a complete overhaul of the system, but as of March 31, 2018 no product other than the CORPS Rules Expansion has appeared and the company seems to be concentrating its efforts on other game systems.http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/556/Applied-Vectors System CORPS uses a custom d10 based system for most actions. Characters A character in CORPS is built based on two types of statistic based on Attributes and Skills. These are purchased in a points based system, using Attribute Points (AP) to purchase attributes, and Skill Points (SP) to purchase skills. The total number of points available to spend depends on the setting and Game Master. A \\"normal\\" human might start with 100AP and 50SP, while a superhero character might start with 200AP and SP (or more). Attributes Attributes are ranked on a 1-10 scale, with an average human rating a 4-5 in any one attribute and 10 being human maximum. CORPS uses six basic Attributes: Strength, Agility, Awareness, Willpower, Health and Power. The cost of an Attribute is the square of the Attribute rank purchased, so a Strength of 4 would cost 16AP, and an Agility of 5 would cost 25AP. Skills Skills are linked to attribute scores via aptitudes (attribute/4) and applied to a specific area. Certain skill level requires Skill Points equal to square of the desired skill level minus the square of the related aptitude. Hence character with a high attribute would have to spend less Skill Points to develop skills related to that attribute. Skills are further broken down into Primary, Secondary and Tertiary skills. These break down specializations of specific skills. Secondary skills have a maximum level of one-half of the associated Primary skill, and Tertiary skills have a maximum level of one-half of the associated Secondary skill. The aptitude savings apply only to primary skills. For example, the character with the Firearms skill of 4 may decide to also purchase the associated Secondary skill of Longarms with a maximum of 2, and the Tertiary skill of M-16A2 with a maximum of 1. This character could then use an M-16A2 rifle with a total skill of 7. Ads and disads Players can also use the points for additional advantages or gain more points by accepting disadvantages. These are very generic like Age, Authority/Duty, Natural Aptitude/Debility, Physical Advantage/Limitation, Psychological Limitation and Wealth (positive or negative). The system also gives some points for writing a character background and drawing a character portrait. Success Rolls To keep the system simple and fast moving, success rolls are not needed for many actions. Any action a character may attempt is rated based on difficulty. If the character's appropriate skill level is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the action succeeds automatically. If it is lower, the player may roll 1d10. If they roll less than 11 minus the difference between their skill and the difficulty of the action times 2, they succeed. For example, the character above with a total skill of 7 attempts an action with a difficulty of 8. It is higher than his skill, so it's not automatic. The difference is only 1, so he needs to roll a 9 or less. (11 - (2x1) = 9). If the action had a difficulty of 9, he would need to roll a 7 or less. While it may seem confusing at first, this system makes success rolls very quick and predictable. The only rolls ever needed are 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1. Any action with a difficulty more than 5 points higher than a character's skill is therefore impossible unless the campaign uses the \\"long shot\\" rule; if the player rolls 1, they may roll again with a -5 difficulty. Advancement Characters advance by increasing their skills and attributes. During play, characters earn additional Attribute and Skills Points related to the attributed and skills they used in play. The cost to increase a skill or attribute is the difference between the cost of the level they currently have, and the cost of the level they want. Therefore, to improve a Strength score from 5 to 6 would cost 11 points (6¬≤ - 5¬≤ = '11, omitting aptitude savings).

It marked the first time that a team from west of Ontario won the cup. The Winnipeg 'Pegs defeated the Hamilton Tigers 18 to 12. Game summary Winnipeg scored on the first play from scrimmage in the game. Hamilton kick returner Jack Craig failed to catch the Winnipeg kickoff and Winnipeg recovered. On the next play Bob Fritz completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Bud Marquardt but the convert failed. Hamilton was able to respond with a field goal. In the second quarter Winnipeg's Russ Rebholz completed a touchdown pass to Greg Kabat and this time the convert was good. Each team scored a single to make the halftime score 12-4. In the third quarter Hamilton's Eddie Wright recovered a blocked kick and returned it to the Winnipeg 15 yard line. Wilf Patterson capped a four play drive to run in for the touchdown. The convert and a Frank Turville single brought Hamilton to within two points. With the score 12-10, ace Winnipeg punt returner Fritz Hanson who had 334 yards in punt returns on the day received a punt near his 30-yard line and returned it 78 yards for the touchdown. Hamilton however forced Winnipeg to give up a safety leaving them a converted touchdown behind. The Tigers marched to the Winnipeg four. A running play went nowhere, so Hamilton tried an onside kick into the end zone. This failed but the Tigers retained possession and on the last play of the game again attempted the onside kick. This time Hanson recovered and ran the ball out of the end zone denying Hamilton even the rouge. Notable facts This was the first Grey Cup game to feature a number of imported players. The Winnipegs had seven imports in the lineup including future Canadian Football Hall of Famers Hanson, Kabat and Rebholz.

Biography   Early days  Sydney Banks was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on January 6, 1917. His parents were English, and Banks and his mother returned to England in 1919, to Cumbria, but they returned to Canada in the late 1920s. After spending a brief time in Chatham, they moved to Toronto, where they lived in Cabbagetown. Banks went first to school at Our Lady of Lourdes, and then to Danforth Tech, but he left school when he was only 14. Career beginnings Banks began his multi-faceted career as a child actor in England. In turn, he became a leading stage director and actor in the 1930s in Canada moving into radio where he earned kudos as an actor and writer. While in England, Banks had done stage work as a child actor, and he then did some radio work for CFRB, as well as getting involved in the Toronto theatre scene. From 1936 to 1941, Banks also acted in many roles with the Theatre of Action, a left-wing drama company, which produced several others who would go on to fame, including Wayne and Shuster, Lou Applebaum, Lou Jacobi, Ben Lennick, Sydney Newman and Lorne Green. Banks directed the Theatre of Action's final production, of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, in Toronto in 1940. He was also a co-founder (with Al Mulock) of the Red Barn Theatre on Lake Simcoe. Military service In 1941, during World War II, Banks joined the army as a captain in the Canadian Army Film Unit, and after D-Day he spent time in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Broadcasting pioneer After demobilization, Banks became executive producer of International Productions. This made him Canada's first active television producer with responsibility for weekly show broadcasts from US border stations for Canadian consumption. He established the first TV commercial production unit in Canada and also in 1949 the first TV department for a major Canadian ad agency. In 1952, as Canada began TV broadcasting, Banks expanded into Canadian television program production. In 1955, he joined the late Spence Caldwell at S.W. Caldwell Ltd as executive producer, and ran the Rank organisation's Queensway Studios. He then moved to Foster Advertising, where he started their television advertising department. This involved frequent travel to the States, where he produced commercials for the Canadian brewing company Carling. Banks was also the principal founder of Canada's first Film Producers Association. In 1962, after working with Jerry Solway of Astral Films on several major television projects, Banks went out on his own, forming his own company S. Banks (In Television) Ltd., and began producing music series for television. He had shows on both CBC and CTV, including Cross Canada Barndance, A Singin', Let's Sing Out, Brand New Scene and Country Music Hall. In 1961 he became the first president of the Directors' Guild of Canada, and returned to the presidential chair twenty years later. He received a Distinguished Service Award from the Directors' Guild in 2003. He also served for a time as a director of the Association of Motion Picture Producers and Laboratories. Also in the sixties, Banks started booking shows and tours for a wide range of artists from country to early rock to comedy, including bringing Jerry Lee Lewis, Eric Clapton and George Carlin to Canada. He was at one time producer of the Mariposa Folk Festival, and was still on the Mariposa Board of Advisors at the time of his death. In 1970 he partnered with Al Bruner in appearing before the CRTC to apply for a licence for Global Television Network , of which he became co-founder and executive producer. By the mid 1970s, Banks had created, produced and sometimes directed over 450 films and TV programs plus innumerable TV commercials. On leaving Global, he became a founder and director of the Toronto cable firm CUC Broadcasting, which became one of the largest cable systems in the Greater Toronto area, and was eventually sold to Shaw Cable in 1994. During the 1980s and 1990s, Banks was president of S Banks Group Inc which includes Ennerdale Productions and S. Banks (in-television) Limited. During this period of time, he travelled around the world doing business in a variety of different industries. While in the eighties and nineties Banks cut back on his business activities to look after his ailing wife Shirley, he remained in close touch with the film business, and, after Shirley's passing, on January 6, 1995, he resumed full-time activities in film and television. In 1998 he was executive producer of the Canadian film Heart of the Sun, whose cast included Christianne Hirt, Michael Riley and Graham Greene, and which was produced by his company Ennerdale Productions. Banks also maintained a home in Palm Springs, California.Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton were spouses at the time Syd Banks died in Toronto on November 14, 2006 at the age of 89.

It was donated to the state of Oklahoma by the Rogers family. The current property comprises of the original 60,000 acre (240 km¬≤) ranch operated by Clem Rogers, Will's father. Originally the ranch contained up to 10,000 Texas Longhorn cattle. The present ranch has 50 Longhorns. History The house was constructed in 1875 by Clem Rogers, who lived there until his wife died in 1890. His son Will Rogers was born on November 4, 1879. It is a two-story Greek Revival style building. The first floor is constructed of native oak, hickory and walnut logs. It measures by , covering an area of . Originally the two front rooms were each by were separated by a dog trot, that was later enclosed to make a foyer. The downstairs rooms were used as a parlor and a master bedroom that also served as Clem Rogers' office. A lean-to addition comprised the kitchen, dining room and a spare bedroom. The upstairs part over the \\"front rooms\\"contained two more bedrooms. Clem Rogers was highly influential in local politics. Thus, the house served not only as a family residence, but represented a seat of local political power. It was often called \\"The White House on the Verdigris.\\" The present barn was erected July 17, 1993 by two dozen Amish carpenters who knew the traditional notch and peg type of construction that was commonly employed in the 19th Century. However, the peak roof is covered with asphalt shingles instead of wooden shakes for greater fire safety. The new barn is by , instead of by for economic reasons. The original barn and possibly two replacements had been destroyed by wildfires. The current barn not only has traditional stalls, it now includes a classroom area that is also usable as an eating area. The house where Will Rogers was born was moved about a mile in the 1960s to its present site on the ranch due to construction of nearby Lake Oologah. On March 7, 2016, Governor Mary Fallon signed Senate Bill 1570 into law, which put the Will Rogers Memorial Commission, which governed both the Will Rogers Memorial Museum and the Dog Iron Ranch, Will Rogers' Birthplace in Oologah, under the control of the Oklahoma Historical Society.

After meeting Benjamin Franklin, Lucas was so inspired‚Äîand so impatient with class injustices in France‚Äîthat he sailed to America. Armed with a letter of introduction from Franklin, Lucas was made a federal land grant judge by Thomas Jefferson, then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He eventually resigned and moved to St. Louis, reportedly in part because he and his wife, Anne, missed French society. Biography Lucas was born in Pont- Audemer, Normandy, France. He attended the Honfleur and Paris Law Schools, and graduated from the law department of the University of Caen in 1782. He practiced law in France until 1784, when he immigrated to the United States and settled near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He engaged in agricultural pursuits. Lucas was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1792 to 1798. He served as judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1794. In the early 1800s, newly-elected President Thomas Jefferson appointed Lucas to a secret mission to St. Louis and New Orleans. Lucas reported directly to the president on the sentiments of the Spaniards in those cities toward the United States, in preparation for Jefferson's efforts at westward expansion. With strong support from President Jefferson, Lucas was elected as a Republican to the Eighth and Ninth Congresses and served until his resignation in 1805, before the assembling of the Ninth Congress. He moved to St. Louis (then part of the Louisiana Territory), having been appointed district judge for the District of Louisiana (which became Missouri Territory in 1812), and served from 1805 until 1820, when he resigned. He also served as commissioner of land claims of northern Louisiana from 1805 to 1812. He then resumed agricultural pursuits. While in Missouri, Lucas donated land in downtown St. Louis in 1816 for a courthouse (known as the Old St. Louis County Courthouse) that is now part of the Gateway Arch National Park. When the courthouse was abandoned in 1930 as the court functions relocated to larger quarters, his descendants fought unsuccessfully to get the courthouse back. The Gateway Arch frames the view of the courthouse from the Mississippi River. Lucas died near St. Louis in 1842. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery. Five of Lucas' sons were to die violently, including Charles Lucas, who was killed in a duel with Senator Thomas Hart Benton. A grandson, Henry Van Noye Lucas, owned a major league baseball franchise in St. Louis in the late 19th century.

It was previously known as \\"San Lorenzo in Formoso\\". It was erected on the site of its dedicatee's martyrdom. It is one of several churches in Rome dedicated to him. Name \\"Panisperna\\" most probably refers to the tradition of the Poor Clares of the adjacent convent distributing bread and ham, \\"pane e perna\\" on 10 August, the Feast of St. Lawrence, in remembrance of his distribution of funds of the Church to the poor. The previous name of the church \\"in Formoso\\" referred to Pope Formosus who erected the first attested church on its site. History Tradition states that the first edifice on the site was constructed during the reign of Emperor Constantine I, only 100 years after the martyrdom of St. Lawrence. In the fifth century, this church was one of the Stational Churches of Rome that the Pope visited on its titular day: the Thursday of the first week in Lent. Recent popes have revived this ancient custom. The first written evidence of an ecclesiastical edifice on the site is from 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII rebuilt the church and annexed an abbey to it. That abbey was given to the Benedictines in 1451 and later hosted the Poor Clares. They were removed in February 1872 as part of the confiscations of the new Italian government, but were restored through the efforts of Cardinal Jacopo Colonna in 1896, who also restored the church and abbey. The Franciscans presently serve the church. The present church is the result of a rebuilding by Carlo Rainaldi in 1575-6 under Pope Gregory XIII. At this time it became denominated \\"in Panisperna\\", rather than \\"in Formoso\\", and its present facade was constructed. A new, outer portico was added in the 17th century, then restored and decorated with images of St. Lawrence and St. Francis of Assisi in 1893-4 by Pope Leo XIII, who in 1843 had been ordained bishop in the church. Pope Leo XIII also constructed a steep flight of steps in front of the church that led to a tree-lined courtyard. A modern, bronze statue of St. Bridget of Sweden adorns this courtyard. A medieval house is preserved adjacent to the church; it has an exterior staircase that renders it one of the few such houses to be preserved in Rome. Interiors Martyrdom of St Lawrence by Pasquale Cati. The church has a single nave with three chapels on each side. A late 16th-century fresco of the Matryrdom of St. Lawrence serves as the reredos of the high altar and was painted by Pasquale Cati, a pupil of Michelangelo. The crucifix of the high altar is from the 14th century. The south side includes a painting of St. Clare of Assisi by Antonio Nessi (1756); a ceiling fresco of the Glory of St. Lawrence by Antonio Bicchierai; the tomb of the brothers St. Crispin and St. Crispinianus, with a painting by Giovanni Francesco Romano; and a painting of the Immaculate Conception by Giuseppe Ranucci. The north side includes the Stigmata of St. Francis by Niccol√≤ Lapiccola; an 18th-century crucifix of the Roman school; and the chapel of St. Bridget of Sweden, in which she was buried before her body was translated to Sweden. St. Bridget used to beg for alms for the poor outside the church and prayed before the crucifix by its high altar. Presently, a martyr named Victoria is interred underneath the altar of the chapel. The painting of \\"St. Bridget Praying before the Crucifix\\" is by Giuseppe Montesanti (1757). Under the porch of the church is a chapel containing the oven that is believed to have been that used for the martyrdom of St. Lawrence.

The United States Interests Section in Havana, although it was staffed by personnel of the United States Foreign Service, was formally a section of the Embassy of Switzerland. St√©phane Bussard, \\"La voix suisse des √âtats-Unis √† Cuba se tait\\", Le Temps, Monday 20 July 2015. A protecting power is a country that represents another sovereign state in a country where it lacks its own diplomatic representation. It is common for protecting powers to be appointed when two countries break off diplomatic relations with each other. The protecting power is responsible for looking after the sending state's diplomatic property and citizens in the hosting state. If diplomatic relations were broken by the outbreak of war, the protecting power will also inquire into the welfare of prisoners of war and look after the interests of civilians in enemy-occupied territory. The institution of protecting power dates back to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and was formalized in the Geneva Convention of 1929. Protecting powers are authorized in all four of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. In addition, the International Red Cross may itself be appointed a protecting power under Protocol I (1977). The practice of selecting a protecting power in time of peace was formalized in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961). Diplomacy Cuba's interests in the United States. President Obama thanks the Swiss government for assistance in Iran (2016) The protecting power is appointed by the sending state and must also be acceptable to the host state. It must therefore maintain diplomatic relations with both states. In time of war, the Geneva Conventions also require the protecting power to be a neutral country. The specific responsibilities and arrangements are agreed between the protecting power, the sending state, and the host country. In a comprehensive mandate, the protecting power carries out most diplomatic functions on behalf of the protected state. This is necessary when relations are so hostile that the sparring nations have no diplomatic or consular staff posted on each other's territory. For example, Sweden carries out limited consular functions for the United States, Canada, and Australia in North Korea. In other cases, the two nations have broken diplomatic relations, but are nevertheless willing to exchange personnel on an informal basis. The protecting power serves as the mechanism for facilitating this exchange. The embassy of the protected state is staffed by its own diplomatic personnel, but it is formally termed an \\"interests section\\" of the protecting power. Between 1991 and 2015, the Cuban Interests Section was staffed by Cubans and occupied the old Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C., but it was formally a section of the Swiss Embassy to the United States. When relations are exceptionally tense, however, such as during a war, the \\"interests section\\" is instead staffed by diplomats from the protecting power. For example, when Iraq and the U.S. broke diplomatic relations due to the Gulf War, Poland became the protecting power for the United States. The United States Interests Section of the Polish Embassy in Iraq was headed by a Polish diplomat.Former Polish Director of U.S. Interests Section in Baghdad Krzysztof Bernacki Receives the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service, Department of State, 28 February 2003 There is no requirement that the same protecting power be selected by both countries, although this is convenient for the purposes of communication. Each may appoint a different protecting power, provided that the choice is acceptable to the other state. There is also no requirement that a country select only one protecting power in the receiving country. During the Second World War, Japan appointed Spain, Sweden and Switzerland to be its protecting powers in the United States.  Current mandates  {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" |- !

All of the belligerents appointed protecting powers, necessitated by the expulsion of diplomats and placing of restrictions on enemy aliens. The United States acted as protecting power for the North German Confederation and several of the smaller German states, while Switzerland was the protecting power for Baden and Bavaria, and Russia for W√ºrttemberg. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom served as the protecting power for France. The energetic efforts of Elihu B. Washburne, the United States Minister to France, set a precedent for the actions of protecting powers in war. The American flag was raised over the North German Embassy, and the embassy archives were transferred to the U.S. legation for safekeeping. Washburne arranged for the evacuation of 30,000 North German subjects from France in the opening days of the war. As the only chief of mission from a major power to remain in the French capital during the Siege of Paris, he was also charged with the protection of seven Latin American consulates and was responsible for feeding 3,000 German civilians who were stuck in the city.  Early developments  After the Franco-Prussian War, the appointment of protecting powers became customary international law. In subsequent wars, the protecting powers expanded their duties with the consent of the belligerents. In the First Sino-Japanese War, both sides selected the United States as their protecting power, establishing the concept of a reciprocal mandate. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States requested neutral inspection of prisoner of war camps for the first time. Since the institution of protecting power had not been formalized by treaty, disputes arose over the protecting power's rights and responsibilities. In the Second Boer War, the British Empire selected the United States to be its protecting power, but the Boers refused to allow the U.S. to transmit funds from the British government to prisoners of war. The Netherlands, acting as the protecting power for the Boer Republics, was also unable to secure an agreement to exchange the names of prisoners of war. Two years later during the Russo-Japanese War, the belligerents agreed to exchange lists of prisoners, communicating through France as the protecting power for Russia, and the United States as the protecting power for Japan. The practice of swapping prisoner lists became customary and was eventually included in the Geneva Convention of 1929.  World Wars  The United States was initially a popular choice for protecting power, going back to its protection of the North German Confederation during the Franco-Prussian War. The pinnacle of American diplomatic protection came during World War I, when the United States accepted reciprocal mandates from five of the largest belligerents on both sides: Britain, France, Austria- Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Between 1914 and 1917, the United States accepted a total of 54 mandates as protecting power. When the United States entered the war on the Allied side in 1917, the American mandates were transferred to smaller neutrals, with the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland being popular choices. In the interwar period, the role of a protecting power was finally formalized in the Geneva Convention of 1929. Protecting powers were allowed to inspect prisoner of war camps, interview prisoners in private, communicate freely with prisoners, and supply books for the prison library. However, a suggestion by the International Committee of the Red Cross that it be made responsible for ensuring compliance with the treaty was rejected. The United States remained a popular choice at the start of World War II, accepting 75 mandates on behalf of Allied countries between 1939 and 1941. However, the United States was no longer seen as a disinterested neutral, and none of the Axis countries asked the United States to be its protecting power. The greater scope of the war also disqualified two of the most popular protecting powers of the First World War: Francoist Spain remained neutral but was Axis-leaning, and the Netherlands were occupied by Germany. As a result, Switzerland and Sweden became the most popular choices for protecting power. Switzerland formally undertook 219 mandates for 35 states, and represented another eight states unofficially, while Sweden accepted 114 mandates for 28 states. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 addressed the abuses that had taken place during World War II. The appointment of a protecting power had been optional in the 1929 Convention, but the 1949 Convention made it obligatory. All four of the Conventions refer to protecting powers, and the Fourth Geneva Convention formalized the role of protecting powers toward civilians. The detaining power was also required to appoint a substitute whenever the benefit of a protecting power was lost. Seventy percent of prisoners of war had lost their protecting power in World War II because their governments were disputed or had ceased to exist. Anticipating a war in which every country was a belligerent, the Conventions provide the option of appointing an international organization as protecting power.  Cold War  The superpower rivalry of the Cold War led to changes in the institution of protecting power. The United States, which had accepted over 200 mandates as protecting power before 1945, was no longer seen as a disinterested third party and managed to secure only one mandate after 1945. Instead, the United States had to appoint a protecting power to represent its interests over a dozen times since 1945. Switzerland and Sweden both chose to remain non-aligned in the Cold War and refused to join any military alliances, leading to their continued popularity as protecting powers. Since 1945, Switzerland has held as many as 24 simultaneous mandates as protecting power. The interests section was born in the aftermath of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, when nine African countries broke off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom. The protecting power for the United Kingdom notified the receiving governments that British diplomats were members of the protecting power's own embassy. As a result, the British diplomats retained their diplomatic immunity and could stay in the former British embassy, which had been placed into the charge of the protecting power. The innovation was widely adopted after the Six-Day War of 1967. The Arab states allowed American diplomats to remain in their capitals as the U.S. Interests Section of the respective protecting power, while Israel allowed Soviet diplomats to remain in Tel Aviv as the Soviet Interests Section of the Finnish Embassy. The fiercest proxy wars of the Cold War were civil wars, including the Vietnam War. Because the principal belligerents each claimed to be the country's sole legitimate government, they did not recognize each other and refused to maintain diplomatic relations with any countries that recognized the other side. This difficulty was resolved by Protocol I (1977) to the Geneva Conventions, which stipulated that the belligerents should nominate protecting powers to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Red Cross would then approach any countries that appeared on both lists, without the belligerents having to communicate with each other directly. If no arrangement could be made with a third country, then the belligerents had to accept the Red Cross or another international organization to act as the protecting power.  Other meanings  * Historically a protecting power held a permanent protectorate over a weaker state, which in practice could constitute a form of colonial domination, in the logic of indirect rule. * The term \\"friendly protection\\" also applied to \\"guarantor\\" state(s) vowing to prevent the protected state (or a specific part) from being overrun by a third party.  Consular services  Certain countries may have agreements to provide limited consular services to the citizens of other countries. This does not necessarily constitute a protecting power relationship, as the host country may not have formally agreed, and there may in fact be diplomatic relations between the host country and the third country, but no physical representation. Without the agreement of the host country, consular officials in this role may not be recognized as representing the interests of another, and be limited to a \\"good offices\\" role. * The United States provides consular services to citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau, which had been part of a US Trust Territory. * Certain Commonwealth countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom, have agreements in certain countries to provide consular services for citizens of the other countries where they do not have physical representation. The United Kingdom provides consular assistance to Canadians abroad where there is no Canadian mission, as stated in each Canadian passport. Under the Canada‚ÄìAustralia Consular Services Sharing Agreement Canada provides consular assistance to Australian citizens to several states in Latin America and Africa; while Australian diplomatic missions reciprocate in several Asia-Pacific states.DFAT Australia http://www.dfat.gov.au/missions/ * Under Article 20 section 2c of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union citizens of European Union countries may request consular services at the missions of other EU countries when their home country does not have a mission locally.Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Europa * In 2006, the governments of Montenegro and Serbia adopted the Memorandum of Agreement between the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia on Consular Protection and Services to the Citizens of Montenegro. By this agreement, Serbia, through its network of diplomatic and consular missions, provides consular services to the Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own.

The Hecatomnid dynasty or Hecatomnids were the rulers of Caria and surrounding areas from about 395‚Äì334 BCE, after Caria had left the Athenian alliance called the Delian League and returned under the control of the Achaemenid Empire. Before that, during the first period of Achaemenid rule, Caria was governed by the Lygdamid dynasty (520-450 BCE). The Hecatomnids were nominally satraps (governors) under the Achaemenid Empire, but ruled with considerable autonomy, and established a hereditary dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Hecatomnus and originally had its seat in Mylasa; Mausolus moved it to Halicarnassus. Hecatomnus' five children succeeded him in succession. The dynasty engaged in sibling marriage, presumably to preserve royal power within the family. The dynasty ended with the conquests of Alexander the Great. Ada adopted him as her son, so that he would succeed to the rule of Caria. The best-known monument of the dynasty is the Mausoleum that Artemisia II built in honor of her husband and brother Mausolus. After the death of Pixodarus, the last member of the Hecatomnids, Orontobates was sent by the king of Persia to succeed him.

Hares Roasting the Hunter He was active from 1465 until his death, and continued to work as a goldsmith; there are some surviving pieces, and many documented commissions from the city of Bocholt. He probably trained in engraving with Master E. S. in South Germany, and may well have been with him at his death c. 1467, since he acquired and reworked forty-one of the master's plates. Another two hundred of van Meckenem's \\"own\\" prints were also copies of Master E. S. engravings. He copied many other printmakers, but it is thought that he engraved some 150 of his own original compositions. Life A Couple Seated on a Bed, after 1495 His birth date is merely an estimate. Recent guesses range from the early 1430s to 1450. His father arrived in Bocholt, Germany, near the border of the Netherlands, in 1457, and though his place of birth is uncertain, Joachim von Sandrart referred to him as Israel von Mecheln, and Karel van Mander referred to him as Israel van Mentz.Israel von Mecheln in Sandrart's Teutsche AkademieIsrael van Mentz in van Mander's Schilder-boeck He was the son of Israhel van Meckenem the Elder, also a goldsmith, who settled in Bocholt. Attempts have been made to identify the father as the Master of the Berlin Passion, an early engraver, but this remains uncertain. Some writers also assign to the father works traditionally given to the son. The very unusual name \\"Israhel\\" suggests the family may have had Jewish origins, but Israhel the Younger was buried in a church, and it might not have been possible for Jews to work as goldsmiths. The \\"van\\" suggests a Dutch origin for the family; various places in Germany and the Netherlands have been suggested as \\"Meckenem\\", as no place generally called exactly that existed at the time. The Master of the Berlin Passion probably worked mainly in the Netherlands, so his identification with Israhel Senior would have implications for the issue of the family origin. Israhel van Meckenem probably trained initially as a goldsmith and engraver with his father, before travelling to work with Master E. S., the leading Northern European engraver of the day. His earliest dated print comes from 1465, and indicates that he created it in Cleves, modern Kleve, on the Dutch border and then Dutch-speaking, where the family had moved. In 1470 he is documented as working in Bamberg in Bavaria; he returned to Bocholt by about 1480, where he remained for the rest of his life. He continued to work at goldsmithing. Some surviving pieces are widely accepted as his and many commissions from the Bocholt council are documented between 1480 and 1498. He was evidently a prosperous and established figure in the town. One of his prints is a double portrait of himself and his wife, Ida, whom he married in the late 1480s;Israhel van Meckenem, Self-portrait and Wife, The British Museum another print is believed by some to show his father. He is documented in various lawsuits against neighbours, and Ida was fined for \\"unseemly speech\\" as well as for \\"mocking and scolding public officials\\". He was buried in the Georgskirche in Bocholt. Work Pair of Lovers playing Instruments by a fountain, signed \\"Israhel\\". Circular engravings such as this may have also been intended as patterns for metal-workers As well as the very numerous copies of Master E. S.'s prints, described above, he copied prints by the Housebook Master, Israhel van Meckenem, Joust of Two Wild Men , Artfinder including some now otherwise lost, Martin Schongauer, and many other German engravers. His famous and very fine late series on the Life of the Virgin appears to have been based on drawings by Hans Holbein the Elder or his workshop, and he may have entered into a regular commercial relationship with Holbein.Parshall, 57 However, some 20% or more of his prints, around 150, seem to be original compositions. His early works were fairly crude, but in the 1480s he developed an effective personal style and made increasingly large and finished works. His own compositions are often very lively, and take a great interest in the secular life of his day. One famous print, supposed to illustrate the story of St John the Baptist and Salome, pushes the specific incidents of the story far in the background to allow space for a scene of court dancers, dressed in the height of contemporary fashion, which takes up most of the plate. Israhel van Meckenem, The Dance at the Court of Herod , Artfinder He was sophisticated in self-presentation, signing later prints with his name and town, and producing the first self-portrait print of himself and his wife, which was also the first portrait print of an identifiable person. Some plates seem to have been reworked more than once by his workshop, or produced in more than one version, and many impressions have survived, so his ability to distribute and sell his prints was evidently equally well developed. He was apparently the first to issue engraved (as opposed to woodcut) indulgences, apparently \\"bootlegged version[s] ... never subject to papal review\\"; one print promises 20,000 years reduction of time in Purgatory per set of prayers, increased in a second state to 45,000 years.Parshall, 56-58 In the Heures de Charles d'Angoul√™me, an important manuscript showing the links between printmaking and illumination in the late 15th century, Robinet Testard incorporated sixteen of van Meckenem's prints, gluing them directly on to the vellum then overpainting.

Family and friends He was grandson of the painter Louis Gurlitt, and son of the art dealer Fritz Gurlitt, founder of the Fritz Gurlitt Gallery, which he had taken over in 1907 and reopened after First World War. At the same time he worked as a publisher. A friend of Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka, he was one of the first gallery owners in Germany to exhibit the work of artists such as Lovis Corinth, Leon Dabo, Henri Matisse and Max Slevogt. Already in the early years of the business he ran into financial difficulties and had to take out loans several times. In 1925 he was unable to repay debts of 50,000 dollars and had instead to hand over artworks which had been offered as collateral for the loans. In 1932 he filed for bankruptcy. Although many customers had lost money and he was unable to pay his debts, in particular his tax liabilities, he continued to work in the art business. The Berlin Regional Director of the Reich Chamber of Visual Arts, Artur Schmidt, successfully intervened several times on Gurlitt's behalf and reduced the amount demanded by the creditors, while Gurlitt ran his affairs in the name of his divorced first wife Julia. He also managed to conceal his partial Jewish descent until 1938, while other members of his family had already had to emigrate. In 1940 however the Gestapo were charged with an investigation of his case. In particular his Jewish lover and business partner Lilly Agoston, as well as his earlier business connections, aroused the distrust of the Nazis. Matisse Exhibition, 1914 In July 1914, Henri Matisse had an exhibition at the Gurlitt gallery, for which Michael and Sarah Stein, Americans living in Paris and brother and sister-in-law of Gertrude Stein, had lent nineteen paintings from their collection. (Flam, 1995, pp. 229). The pictures were lost in the first days of World War I \\"and subsequently confiscated, or threatened with confiscation\\", but \\"they survived intact [even though they] never returned to Paris, resurfacing after complex and protracted negotiations in private hands in Copenhagen (where [many] can be seen today in the Statens Museum for Kunst).\\" (Spurling, 2003). The Nazi Era His role during the Nazi era is difficult to establish. On the one hand he had to live with the suspicions and investigations mentioned, and indeed two colleagues had their businesses closed down. On the other hand, he could continue to operate in the international art trade and was involved in the sales of seized works of \\"Degenerate art\\" abroad as well as in the procurement of material for the planned ‚ÄúF√ºhrer Museum‚Äù in Linz - the latter, however, probably peripheral. He reaped considerable benefit from the procurement of works of art on behalf the propaganda Ministry of Joseph Goebbels and on the basis of various auctions in the Dorotheum in Vienna it is clear that he was also involved with the sale of expropriated Jewish property. In 1939 Gurlitt made an offer to the curator of the Basle Museum of Art to put together for him a collection of first-class works from those seized by the Nazis. This trade did not happen however. Instead, through his lover, he acquired for himself several works of art which had been seized from museums, and took a substantial commission for other works which he sold overseas on behalf the government. In 1940 Gurlitt's ex-wife and his second wife acquired a mansion in Bad Aussee to accommodate the Gurlitt art collection. Again, this action can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand it was clearly a means of ensuring the safety of a substantial private property against the threat of bombing (in 1943 Gurlitt's Berlin home and business premises were actually bombed out), on the other hand this outstorage of the artworks can be seen as a means of protecting them from the Nazis who threatened to destroy 'degenerate' art. The Postwar Era After the Second World War Wolfgang Gurlitt remained in Austria - possibly to avoid his past catching up with him. In 1946 he was involved already in negotiations about a gallery of modern art in Linz. A majority of the exhibits were to originate from Gurlitt's collection, with artistic direction being entrusted to Gurlitt himself. There was a provisional opening in 1947, with the actual opening taking place in 1948. Gurlitt organised exciting exhibitions; first he presented the work of Kubins, and following this a Kokoschka exhibition. In 1952 there was a notable exhibition of graphic art under the motto \\"No More War!\\". Gurlitt also profited in Austria from his skilful dealings with the occupying powers. Already in 1946 he changed citizenship. He received travel and transportation facilities as well as rapid access to his bank accounts which had at first been closed. Despite numerous conflicts with the trustees of the museum Gurlitt was by January 1956 director of the new gallery in Linz. Again the outcome was major financial difficulties. This may have been the major reason that the major part of the Gurlitt collection was transferred in 1953 to the city of Linz. However, the provenance of many of the works was uncertain, which made them worth less in the negotiations. Further discrepancies - Gurlitt did not separate his interests as collection director and art dealer clearly enough - finally led to him being asked to resign and his name being removed from the Gallery name (at that time, New Gallery of the City of Linz, Wolfgang Gurlitt Museum). Three years later however he went to court to have the old name restored. The composer Manfred Gurlitt was his stepbrother, and was a cousin of the musicologist Wilibald Gurlitt.

He was the author of many learned works. Biography The son of a Sheffield bookseller, Pye-Smith was surrounded by books in his youth and was practically self-taught: he did take Latin lessons from Jehoiada Brewer. He became a Dissenting academic and author, and was the first Fellow of the Royal Society from a Nonconformist background. He was also elected a Fellow of the Geological Society at a time when there was considerable debate about accepting the idea of geological time, and if so to find ways of reconciling this with the teachings of the Old Testament. He was an advocate of gap creationism.McIver, Thomas Allen. (1989). Creationism: Intellectual Origins, Cultural Context, and Theoretical Diversity. University of California, Los Angeles. Throughout his life he worked for the abolition of slavery. During the politically turbulent 1790s, Pye-Smith took over the editorship of the Sheffield Iris, the leading abolitionist newspaper in the North of England, during the imprisonment of its editor, his friend James Montgomery. In 1830 Pye-Smith took the Chair of the Board of Congregational Ministers when it passed an anti-slavery motion to secure support from all Congregational chapels across the country in petitioning parliament: \\"That we feel it to be a solemn duty to employ our influence with our congregations and the public, to promote petitions to both Houses of Parliament for the abolition of Colonial Slavery, and therefore pledge ourselves, and beg to recommend to our brethren throughout the kingdom to prepare from each congregation such petitions to parliament...\\" The Congregationalists' 1833 abolition lecture, \\"The Sinfulness of Colonial Slavery\\", was delivered at John Pye-Smith's Meeting House in Hackney by his former pupil, Robert Halley. Work in education & theological training A committee of Nonconformist merchants and ministers, including Pye-Smith, founded Mill Hill School.A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1. british-history.ac.uk for boys on 25 January 1807. Pye-Smith was the theological tutor at the Dissenting academy known as Homerton College near Hackney, London for forty-five years between 1805 and 1850. His pupils included Robert Halley, future Principal of New College, London; Samuel Dyer, the missionary; and William Johnson Fox of the South Place Chapel, later the South Place Ethical Society. Pye-Smith was minister of the Old Gravel Pit Chapel in Chatham Place, Hackney for nearly as long, from 1811‚Äì50. Monument Dr John Pye Smith died in Hackney in 1851 and is buried below a marble chest tomb monument in Dr Watts' Walk, at the Congregationalists' non-denominational garden cemetery in the grounds of Abney Park, Stoke Newington, north London. He was the grandfather of Philip Henry Pye-Smith.

A national outcry galvanised the gay rights movement led by CHE (The Campaign for Homosexual Equality) and GLF (Gay Liberation Front). In 1997 he left Brighton for Amsterdam, where he was given the freedom to create and present new work at the theatre in the former COC Amsterdam building on Rozenstraat until its closure in 2007. In 2014 he returned to England and now lives and works again in Brighton from where he has created a series of modern historical gay fiction 'The Nick & Greg Books'. The books chart the lives of two gay teenagers, Nick & Greg, who meet as teens in Brighton in the late 1950s. The books chart their lives and relationships through the decades from the 1950s up to the present day (2019). The books chronicle not only the massive social changes that occur, but also key literary and cultural influences. In August 2018 and November 2019 he attended the Salon du Livre Gay (Gay Book Fair) in Paris to present 'The Nick & Greg Books' and launch the fourth book in the series 'Greg in Paris' as well as the limited edition hardcover 'Le Far West'. In June 2020 a new novel entitled '2020' was published. The book, written immediately before the Covid-19 lockdowns began in France and the United Kingdom, presents two characters, Alex and Paul, seeking to defy the coming crisis. Politically, he is against Libertarian conservatism.

History The 4.5mm MKR was designed in 1978 by Interdynamic AB, a Swedish company, around the time of the rise of \\"micro-caliber\\" popularity. Firearms companies everywhere were trying to achieve a type of practical, light and cheap ammunition. Micro-caliber (less than 5mm / .20\\" caliber) ammunition makers wished to achieve high velocity, flat trajectory and good penetration while keeping weight and recoil low so as to facilitate controllable use in individual automatic weapons.  Design  The 4.5mm MKR was essentially a .22 WMR rimfire case necked down from 5.6mm to accept a 4.5mm bullet, for use in the Interdynamics MKR rifle and carbine. It would be supplied in single-use, 50-round polymer magazines. The cartridge featured a curved taper of its body to aid extraction and a short, shoulderless neck. Its 4.5mm caliber boat-tail spitzer bullet was 22mm long and made by cold rolling solid copper wire. The lightweight bullet of 1.58 grams / 24.4 grains reportedly achieved a muzzle velocity of about 1,000 m/sec / 3,270 ft/sec and a muzzle energy of 790 Joules / 583 ft lbs. This claim contrasts sharply with the comparable, more modern .17 HMR which has a muzzle energy of 340 Joule / 250 ft. lbs. Due to the combination of a thin-walled rimfire case with a high-pressure powder charge, the cartridge needed good external support so the MKR rifle was designed to use locked breech, gas-operated action with a vertically tilting bolt rather than straight blow back operation. This ensured the bolt only opened once cartridge pressure had reduced to safe levels. The rifle and carbine, which differed only in barrel length, were fired from the open bolt position to prevent cook-off ignition of the thin walled cartridges. Users could select single shot, 3-round burst or fully automatic modes. The burst and fully automatic modes had a high rate of fire of 1800 rounds per minute.  Performance  The 4.5x26 MKR was claimed to be on par with a 5.56√ó45mm NATO M-193 bullet at up to 300 meters while one could carry 3.5 times as many of the lighter cartridges. Its slender 4.5mm projectile could penetrate a steel helmet up to 300m out to which range it had a similar ballistic curve to the 5.56x45NATO with M-193 projectile. This was due to a combination of slightly higher velocity, a similar Ingalls ballistic coefficient to the M-193 bullet (0.245 vs 0.265), and the superior penetrating ability of solid cold-rolled copper bullets vs jacketed lead bullets given an equal sectional density. It was potentially lethal (80 Joules) up to 750m and its tendency to tumble on impact was twice that of the 5.56 M-193 bullet, thus ensuring more effective transfer of its diminutive energy to its target, especially as its tip tended to bend. Maximum range was 2,500m. Due to concerns about stopping power, reliability, and problems with using rimfire ammunition, the MKR project was abandoned at the prototype stage and the 4.5mm MKR never saw service or any kind of widespread use.

Biography  Young Perry Alsbury was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1814. He was the youngest son of ten children. His father, Thomas Alsbury, Jr., was a frontiersman and Indian spy in Virginia (now West Virginia) in the 1790s, and then an early settler and tavern/innkeeper in Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky in the early 1800s. His mother was Leah Catlett, born in Maryland. In the early 1820s the Alsbury family moved from Kentucky to Texas. Stephen F. Austin had written a letter to his father asking the Alsbury family, which included seven sons, to move to Texas and become part of the original Austin Colony. They settled in Brazoria on the Brazos River. Land was what had enticed the family to move to the area.\\"Diary of Willam Fairfax Grey, Virginia to Texas 1835-1837\\" William Fairfax Grey Thomas Alsbury was given two leagues and 1¬Ω labors (between 9,000 and 10,000 acres) (36 and 40 km¬≤).

It was headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1291, on the island of Rhodes from 1310 until 1522, in Malta from 1530 until 1798 and at Saint Petersburg from 1799 until 1801. Today several organizations continue the Hospitaller tradition, specifically the mutually recognised orders of St. John which are Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John, the Johanniterorden, the Johanniter Orde in Nederland, the Johanniterorden i Sverige. The Hospitallers arose in the early 11th century, during the time of the Cluniac movement (a Benedictine Reform movement), as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in the Muristan district of Jerusalem, dedicated to John the Baptist and founded around 1099 by Gerard Thom to provide care for sick, poor or injured pilgrims coming to the Holy Land. Some scholars, however, consider that the Amalfitan order and hospital were different from Gerard Thom's order and its hospital. After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade, the organisation became a military religious order under its own papal charter, charged with the care and defence of the Holy Land. Following the conquest of the Holy Land by Islamic forces, the knights operated from Rhodes, over which they were sovereign, and later from Malta, where they administered a vassal state under the Spanish viceroy of Sicily. The Hospitallers were one of the smallest groups to briefly colonise parts of the Americas: they acquired four Caribbean islands in the mid-17th century, which they turned over to France in the 1660s. The knights became divided during the Protestant Reformation, when rich commanderies of the order in northern Germany and the Netherlands became Protestant and largely separated from the Roman Catholic main stem, remaining separate to this day, although ecumenical relations between the descendant chivalric orders are amicable. The order was suppressed in England, Denmark, as well as in some other parts of northern Europe, and it was further damaged by Napoleon's capture of Malta in 1798, following which it became dispersed throughout Europe.

Dedicatory miniature in Gestorum Rhodie obsidionis commentarii (account of the Siege of Rhodes of 1480), BNF Lat 6067 fol. 3v, dated 1483/4. Pie postulatio voluntatis. Bull issued by Pope Paschal II in 1113 in favor of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, which was to transform what was a community of pious men into an institution within the Church. By virtue of this document, the pope officially recognized the existence of the new organisation as an operative and militant part of the Roman Catholic Church, granting it papal protection and confirming its properties in Europe and Asia. In 603, Pope Gregory I commissioned the Ravennate Abbot Probus, who was previously Gregory's emissary at the Lombard court, to build a hospital in Jerusalem to treat and care for Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. In 800, Emperor Charlemagne enlarged Probus' hospital and added a library to it. About 200 years later, in 1005, Caliph Al- Hakim bi-Amr Allah destroyed the hospital and three thousand other buildings in Jerusalem. In 1023, merchants from Amalfi and Salerno in Italy were given permission by the Caliph Ali az-Zahir of Egypt to rebuild the hospital in Jerusalem. The hospital, which was built on the site of the monastery of Saint John the Baptist, took in Christian pilgrims traveling to visit the Christian holy sites. It was served by the Order of Saint Benedict. The monastic hospitaler order was founded following the First Crusade by Gerard Thom, whose role as founder was confirmed by the papal bull Pie postulatio voluntatis issued by Pope Paschal II in 1113. Gerard acquired territory and revenues for his order throughout the Kingdom of Jerusalem and beyond. Under his successor, Raymond du Puy, the original hospice was expanded to an infirmary near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Initially the group cared for pilgrims in Jerusalem, but the order soon extended to providing pilgrims with an armed escort, which soon grew into a substantial force. Thus the Order of St. John imperceptibly became military without losing its charitable character. Raymond du Puy, who succeeded Gerard as Master of the Hospital in 1118, organised a militia from the order's members, dividing the order into three ranks: knights, men at arms, and chaplains. Raymond offered the service of his armed troops to Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and the order from this time participated in the crusades as a military order, in particular distinguishing itself in the Siege of Ascalon of 1153. In 1130, Pope Innocent II gave the order its coat of arms, a silver cross in a field of red (gueulles).Louis Moreri, The Great Historical Dictionary (1759): The Hospitallers and the Knights Templar became the most formidable military orders in the Holy Land. Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor, pledged his protection to the Knights of St. John in a charter of privileges granted in 1185. The statutes of Roger de Moulins (1187) deal only with the service of the sick; the first mention of military service is in the statutes of the ninth grand master, Fernando Afonso of Portugal (about 1200). In the latter a marked distinction is made between secular knights, externs to the order, who served only for a time, and the professed knights, attached to the order by a perpetual vow, and who alone enjoyed the same spiritual privileges as the other religious. The order numbered three distinct classes of membership: the military brothers, the brothers infirmarians, and the brothers chaplains, to whom was entrusted the divine service. In 1248 Pope Innocent IV (1243‚Äì1254) approved a standard military dress for the Hospitallers to be worn during battle. Instead of a closed cape over their armour (which restricted their movements), they wore a red surcoat with a white cross emblazoned on it. no. 78, no. 2479. Many of the more substantial Christian fortifications in the Holy Land were built by the Templars and the Hospitallers. At the height of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Hospitallers held seven great forts and 140 other estates in the area. The two largest of these, their bases of power in the Kingdom and in the Principality of Antioch, were the Krak des Chevaliers and Margat in Syria. The property of the Order was divided into priories, subdivided into bailiwicks, which in turn were divided into commanderies. As early as the late 12th century the order had begun to achieve recognition in the Kingdom of England and Duchy of Normandy. As a result, buildings such as St John's Jerusalem and the Knights Gate, Quenington in England were built on land donated to the order by local nobility. An Irish house was established at Kilmainham, near Dublin, and the Irish Prior was usually a key figure in Irish public life. The Knights also received the \\"Land of Severin\\" (Terra de Zeurino), along with the nearby mountains, from B√©la IV of Hungary, as shown by a charter of grant issued on 2 June 1247. The Banate of Severin was a march, or border province, of the Kingdom of Hungary between the Lower Danube and the Olt River, today part of Romania, and back then bordered across the Danube by a powerful Bulgarian Empire. However, the Hospitaller hold on the Banate was only brief.  Knights of Cyprus and Rhodes  Street of Knights in Rhodes The Knights' castle at Rhodes After the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1291 (the city of Jerusalem had fallen in 1187), the Knights were confined to the County of Tripoli and, when Acre was captured in 1291, the order sought refuge in the Kingdom of Cyprus. Finding themselves becoming enmeshed in Cypriot politics, their Master, Guillaume de Villaret, created a plan of acquiring their own temporal domain, selecting Rhodes to be their new home, part of the Byzantine empire. His successor, Foulques de Villaret, executed the plan, and on 15 August 1310, after more than four years of campaigning, the city of Rhodes surrendered to the knights. They also gained control of a number of neighboring islands and the Anatolian port of Halicarnassus and the island of Kastellorizo. Rhodes and other possessions of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John. Pope Clement V dissolved the Hospitallers' rival order, the Knights Templar, in 1312 with a series of papal bulls, including the Ad providam bull that turned over much of their property to the Hospitallers. The holdings were organised into eight \\"Tongues\\" or Langues, one each in Crown of Aragon, Auvergne, Crown of Castile, Kingdom of England, France, Holy Roman Empire, Italy and Provence. Each was administered by a Prior or, if there was more than one priory in the langue, by a Grand Prior. At Rhodes, and later Malta, the resident knights of each langue were headed by a baili. The English Grand Prior at the time was Philip De Thame, who acquired the estates allocated to the English langue from 1330 to 1358. In 1334, the Knights of Rhodes defeated Andronicus and his Turkish auxiliaries. In the 14th century, there were several other battles in which they fought. In 1374, the Knights took over the defence of Smyrna, conquered by a crusade in 1344. They held it until it was besieged and taken by Timur in 1402. On Rhodes the Hospitallers, by then also referred to as the Knights of Rhodes, were forced to become a more militarized force, fighting especially with the Barbary pirates. They withstood two invasions in the 15th century, one by the Sultan of Egypt in 1444 and another by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1480 who, after capturing Constantinople and defeating the Byzantine Empire in 1453, made the Knights a priority target. In 1402 they created a stronghold on the peninsula of Halicarnassus (presently Bodrum). They used pieces of the partially destroyed Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, to strengthen their rampart, the Petronium. In 1522, an entirely new sort of force arrived: 400 ships under the command of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent delivered 100,000 men to the island (200,000 in other sources). Against this force the Knights, under Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, had about 7,000 men-at-arms and their fortifications. The siege lasted six months, at the end of which the surviving defeated Hospitallers were allowed to withdraw to Sicily. Despite the defeat, both Christians and Muslims seem to have regarded the conduct of Phillipe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam as extremely valiant, and the Grand Master was proclaimed a Defender of the Faith by Pope Adrian VI.

In 1548, Charles V raised Heitersheim, the headquarters of the Hospitallers in Germany, into the Principality of Heitersheim, making the Grand Prior of Germany a prince of the Holy Roman Empire with a seat and vote in the Reichstag., p. 264. The Order may have played a direct part in supporting the Malta native Iacob Heraclid who, in 1561, established a temporary foothold in Moldavia (see Battle of Verbia). The Hospitallers also continued their maritime actions against the Muslims and especially the Barbary pirates. Although they had only a few ships they quickly drew the ire of the Ottomans, who were unhappy to see the order resettled. In 1565 Suleiman sent an invasion force of about 40,000 men to besiege the 700 knights and 8,000 soldiers and expel them from Malta and gain a new base from which to possibly launch another assault on Europe. This is known as the Great Siege of Malta. At first the battle went as badly for the Hospitallers as Rhodes had: most of the cities were destroyed and about half the knights killed. On 18 August the position of the besieged was becoming desperate: dwindling daily in numbers, they were becoming too feeble to hold the long line of fortifications. But when his council suggested the abandonment of Birgu and Senglea and withdrawal to Fort St. Angelo, Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette refused. The Viceroy of Sicily had not sent help; possibly the Viceroy's orders from Philip II of Spain were so obscurely worded as to put on his own shoulders the burden of the decision whether to help the Order at the expense of his own defences. A wrong decision could mean defeat and exposing Sicily and Naples to the Ottomans. He had left his own son with La Valette, so he could hardly be indifferent to the fate of the fortress. Whatever may have been the cause of his delay, the Viceroy hesitated until the battle had almost been decided by the unaided efforts of the knights, before being forced to move by the indignation of his own officers. Re-enactment of 16th-century military drills conducted by the Knights. Fort Saint Elmo, Valletta, Malta, 8 May 2005. On 23 August came yet another grand assault, the last serious effort, as it proved, of the besiegers. It was thrown back with the greatest difficulty, even the wounded taking part in the defence. The plight of the Turkish forces, however, was now desperate. With the exception of Fort Saint Elmo, the fortifications were still intact. Working night and day the garrison had repaired the breaches, and the capture of Malta seemed more and more impossible. Many of the Ottoman troops in crowded quarters had fallen ill over the terrible summer months. Ammunition and food were beginning to run short, and the Ottoman troops were becoming increasingly dispirited by the failure of their attacks and their losses. The death on 23 June of skilled commander Dragut, a corsair and admiral of the Ottoman fleet, was a serious blow. The Turkish commanders, Piali Pasha and Mustafa Pasha, were careless. They had a huge fleet which they used with effect on only one occasion. They neglected their communications with the African coast and made no attempt to watch and intercept Sicilian reinforcements. On 1 September they made their last effort, but the morale of the Ottoman troops had deteriorated seriously and the attack was feeble, to the great encouragement of the besieged, who now began to see hopes of deliverance. The perplexed and indecisive Ottomans heard of the arrival of Sicilian reinforcements in Mellieƒßa Bay. Unaware that the force was very small, they broke off the siege and left on 8 September. The Great Siege of Malta may have been the last action in which a force of knights won a decisive victory. When the Ottomans departed, the Hospitallers had but 600 men able to bear arms. The most reliable estimate puts the number of the Ottoman army at its height at some 40,000 men, of whom 15,000 eventually returned to Constantinople. The siege is portrayed vividly in the frescoes of Matteo P√©rez in the Hall of St. Michael and St. George, also known as the Throne Room, in the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta; four of the original modellos, painted in oils by Perez d'Aleccio between 1576 and 1581, can be found in the Cube Room of the Queen's House at Greenwich, London. After the siege a new city had to be built: the present capital city of Malta, named Valletta in memory of the Grand Master who had withstood the siege. In 1607, the Grand Master of the Hospitallers was granted the status of Reichsf√ºrst (Prince of the Holy Roman Empire), even though the Order's territory was always south of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1630, he was awarded ecclesiastic equality with cardinals, and the unique hybrid style His Most Eminent Highness, reflecting both qualities qualifying him as a true Prince of the Church.  Knights in the 16th and 17th centuries: Reconquista of the sea  Following the knights' relocation to Malta, they had found themselves devoid of their initial reason for existence: assisting and joining the crusades in the Holy Land was now impossible, for reasons of military and financial strength along with geographical position. With dwindling revenues from European sponsors no longer willing to support a costly and meaningless organization, the knights turned to policing the Mediterranean from the increased threat of piracy, most notably from the threat of the Ottoman-endorsed Barbary pirates operating from the North African coastline. Boosted towards the end of the 16th century by an air of invincibility following the successful defence of their island in 1565 and compounded by the Christian victory over the Ottoman fleet in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the knights set about protecting Christian merchant shipping to and from the Levant and freeing the captured Christian slaves who formed the basis of the Barbary corsairs' piratical trading and navies. This became known as the \\"corso\\". Yet the Order soon struggled on a now reduced income. By policing the Mediterranean they augmented the assumed responsibility of the traditional protectors of the Mediterranean, the naval city states of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. Further compounding their financial woes; over the course of this period the exchange rate of the local currencies against the 'scudo' that were established in the late 16th century gradually became outdated, meaning the knights were gradually receiving less at merchant factories. Economically hindered by the barren island they now inhabited, many knights went beyond their call of duty by raiding Muslim ships. More and more ships were plundered, from whose profits many knights lived idly and luxuriously, taking local women to be their wives and enrolling in the navies of France and Spain in search of adventure, experience, and yet more money. The Knights' changing attitudes were coupled with the effects of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation and the lack of stability from the Roman Catholic Church. All this affected the knights strongly as the 16th and 17th centuries saw a gradual decline in the religious attitudes of many of the Christian peoples of Europe (and, concomitantly, the importance of a religious army), and thus in the Knights' regular tributes from European nations. That the knights, a chiefly Roman Catholic military order, pursued the readmittance of England as one of its member states ‚Äì the Order there had been suppressed under King Henry VIII of England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries ‚Äì upon the succession of the Protestant queen Elizabeth I of England aptly demonstrates the new religious tolerance within the Order. For a time, the Order even possessed a German langue which was part Protestant or Evangelical and part Roman Catholic. The moral decline that the knights underwent over the course of this period is best highlighted by the decision of many knights to serve in foreign navies and become \\"the mercenary sea-dogs of the 14th to 17th centuries\\", with the French Navy proving the most popular destination. This decision went against the knights' cardinal reason for existence, in that by serving a European power directly they faced the very real possibility that they would be fighting against another Roman Catholic force, as in the few Franco-Spanish naval skirmishes that occurred in this period. The biggest paradox is the fact that for many years the Kingdom of France remained on amicable terms with the Ottoman Empire, the Knights' greatest and bitterest foe and purported sole purpose for existence. Paris signed many trade agreements with the Ottomans and agreed to an informal (and ultimately ineffective) cease-fire between the two states during this period. That the Knights associated themselves with the allies of their sworn enemies shows their moral ambivalence and the new commercial-minded nature of the Mediterranean in the 17th century. Serving in a foreign navy, in particular that of the French, gave the Knights the chance to serve the Church and for many, their King, to increase their chances of promotion in either their adopted navy or in Malta, to receive far better pay, to stave off their boredom with frequent cruises, to embark on the highly preferable short cruises of the French Navy over the long caravans favoured by the Maltese, and if the Knight desired, to indulge in some of the pleasures of a traditional debauched seaport. In return, the French gained and quickly assembled an experienced navy to stave off the threat of the Spanish and their Habsburg masters. The shift in attitudes of the Knights over this period is ably outlined by Paul Lacroix who states: With the knights' exploits growing in fame and wealth, the European states became more complacent about the Order, and more unwilling to grant money to an institution that was perceived to be earning a healthy sum on the high seas. Thus a vicious cycle occurred, increasing the raids and reducing the grants received from the nation-states of Christendom to such an extent that the balance of payments on the island had become dependent on conquest. The European powers lost interest in the knights as they focused their intentions largely on one another during the Thirty Years' War. In February 1641 a letter was sent from an unknown dignitary in the Maltese capital of Valletta to the knights' most trustworthy ally and benefactor, Louis XIV of France, stating the Order's troubles: Maltese authorities did not mention the fact that they were making a substantial profit policing the seas and seizing infidel ships and cargoes. The authorities on Malta immediately recognised the importance of corsairing to their economy and set about encouraging it, as despite their vows of poverty, the Knights were granted the ability to keep a portion of the spoglio, which was the prize money and cargo gained from a captured ship, along with the ability to fit out their own galleys with their new wealth. The great controversy that surrounded the knights' corso was their insistence on their policy of 'vista'. This enabled the Order to stop and board all shipping suspected of carrying Turkish goods and confiscate the cargo to be re-sold at Valletta, along with the ship's crew, who were by far the most valuable commodity on the ship. Naturally many nations claimed to be victims of the knights' over-eagerness to stop and confiscate any goods remotely connected to the Turks. In an effort to regulate the growing problem, the authorities in Malta established a judicial court, the Consiglio del Mer, where captains who felt wronged could plead their case, often successfully. The practice of issuing privateering licenses and thus state endorsement, which had been in existence for a number of years, was tightly regulated as the island's government attempted to haul in the unscrupulous knights and appease the European powers and limited benefactors. Yet these efforts were not altogether successful, as the Consiglio del Mer received numerous complaints around the year 1700 of Maltese piracy in the region. Ultimately, the rampant over- indulgence in privateering in the Mediterranean was to be the knights' downfall in this particular period of their existence as they transformed from serving as the military outpost of a united Christendom to becoming another nation-state in a commercially oriented continent soon to be overtaken by the trading nations of the North Sea.  Life in Malta  Auberge de Castille in Valletta, an example of 18th-century Baroque architecture built by the Order. Having gained Malta, the knights stayed for 268 years, transforming what they called \\"merely a rock of soft sandstone\\" into a flourishing island with mighty defences and a capital city (Valletta) known as Superbissima, \\"Most Proud\\", amongst the great powers of Europe. However, \\"the indigenous islanders had not particularly enjoyed the rule of the Knights of St John\\". Most Knights were French and excluded the native islanders from important positions. They were especially loathed for the way they took advantage of the native women. In 1301, the Order was organized in seven langues; by order of precedence, Provence, Auvergne, France, Aragon, Italy, England, and Germany. In 1462, the Langue of Aragon was divided into Castile-Portugal and Aragon-Navarre. The English Langue went into abeyance after the order's properties were taken over by Henry VIII in 1540. In 1782, it was revived as the Anglo-Bavarian Langue, containing Bavarian and Polish priories. The structure of langues was replaced in the late 19th century by a system of national associations. When the Knights first arrived, the natives were apprehensive about their presence and viewed them as arrogant intruders. The Maltese were excluded from serving in the order. The Knights were even generally dismissive of the Maltese nobility. However, the two groups coexisted peacefully, since the Knights boosted the economy, were charitable, and protected against Muslim attacks. Not surprisingly, hospitals were among the first projects to be undertaken on Malta, where French soon supplanted Italian as the official language (though the native inhabitants continued to speak Maltese among themselves). The knights also constructed fortresses, watch towers, and naturally, churches. Its acquisition of Malta signalled the beginning of the Order's renewed naval activity. View of the fortifications of Valletta The building and fortification of Valletta, named for Grand Master la Valette, was begun in 1566, soon becoming the home port of one of the Mediterranean's most powerful navies. Valletta was designed by Francesco Laparelli, a military engineer, and his work was then taken up by Girolamo Cassar. The city was completed in 1571. The island's hospitals were expanded as well. The Sacra Infermeria could accommodate 500 patients and was famous as one of the finest in the world. In the vanguard of medicine, the Hospital of Malta included Schools of Anatomy, Surgery and Pharmacy. Valletta itself was renowned as a centre of art and culture. The Conventual Church of St. John, completed in 1577, contains works by Caravaggio and others. In Europe, most of the Order's hospitals and chapels survived the Reformation, though not in Protestant or Evangelical countries. In Malta, meanwhile, the Public Library was established in 1761. The University was founded seven years later, followed, in 1786, by a School of Mathematics and Nautical Sciences. Despite these developments, some of the Maltese grew to resent the Order, which they viewed as a privileged class. This even included some of the local nobility, who were not admitted to the Order. In Rhodes, the knights had been housed in auberges (inns) segregated by Langues. This structure was maintained in Birgu (1530‚Äì1571) and then Valletta (from 1571). The auberges in Birgu remain, mostly undistinguished 16th-century buildings. Valletta still has the auberges of Castille (1574; renovated 1741 by Grand Master de Vilhena, now the Prime Minister's offices), Italy (renovated 1683 by Grand Master Carafa, now an art museum), Aragon (1571, now a government ministry), Bavaria (former Palazzo Carnerio, purchased in 1784 for the newly formed Langue, now occupied by the Lands Authority) and Provence (now National Museum of Archaeology). In the Second World War, the auberge d'Auvergne was damaged (and later replaced by Law Courts) and the auberge de France was destroyed.

The property of the English branch was confiscated in 1540. The German Bailiwick of Brandenburg became Lutheran in 1577, then more broadly Evangelical, but continued to pay its financial contribution to the Order until 1812, when the Protector of the Order in Prussia, King Frederick William III, turned it into an order of merit; in 1852, his son and successor as Protector, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, restored the Johanniterorden to its continuing place as the chief non-Roman Catholic branch of the Knights Hospitaller. The Knights of Malta had a strong presence within the Imperial Russian Navy and the pre-revolutionary French Navy. When Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy was appointed governor of the French colony on Saint Kitts in 1639, he was a prominent Knight of St. John and dressed his retinue with the emblems of the Order. In 1651, the knights bought from the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique the islands of Sainte-Christophe, Saint Martin, and Saint Barth√©lemy. The Order's presence in the Caribbean was eclipsed with De Poincy's death in 1660. He had also bought the island of Saint Croix as his personal estate and deeded it to the Knights of St. John. In 1665, the order sold their Caribbean possessions to the French West India Company, ending the Order's presence in that region. The decree of the French National Assembly in 1789 abolishing feudalism in France also abolished the Order in France: The French Revolutionary Government seized the assets and properties of the Order in France in 1792.  Loss of Malta  Emperor Paul wearing the Crown of the Grand Master of the Order of Malta (1799). Their Mediterranean stronghold of Malta was captured by Napoleon in 1798 during his expedition to Egypt. Napoleon demanded from Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim that his ships be allowed to enter the port and to take on water and supplies. The Grand Master replied that only two foreign ships could be allowed to enter the port at a time. Bonaparte, aware that such a procedure would take a very long time and would leave his forces vulnerable to Admiral Nelson, immediately ordered a cannon fusillade against Malta. The French soldiers disembarked in Malta at seven points on the morning of 11 June and attacked. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Maltese in the west were forced to surrender. Napoleon opened negotiations with the fortress capital of Valletta. Faced with vastly superior French forces and the loss of western Malta, the Grand Master negotiated a surrender to the invasion. Hompesch left Malta for Trieste on 18 June. He resigned as Grand Master on 6 July 1799. The knights were dispersed, though the order continued to exist in a diminished form and negotiated with European governments for a return to power. The Russian Emperor, Paul I, gave the largest number of knights shelter in Saint Petersburg, an action which gave rise to the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller and the Order's recognition among the Russian Imperial Orders. The refugee knights in Saint Petersburg proceeded to elect Tsar Paul as their Grand Master ‚Äì a rival to Grand Master von Hompesch until the latter's abdication left Paul as the sole Grand Master. Grand Master Paul I created, in addition to the Roman Catholic Grand Priory, a \\"Russian Grand Priory\\" of no fewer than 118 Commanderies, dwarfing the rest of the Order and open to all Christians. Paul's election as Grand Master was, however, never ratified under Roman Catholic canon law, and he was the de facto rather than de jure Grand Master of the Order. By the early 19th century, the order had been severely weakened by the loss of its priories throughout Europe. Only 10% of the order's income came from traditional sources in Europe, with the remaining 90% being generated by the Russian Grand Priory until 1810. This was partly reflected in the government of the Order being under Lieutenants, rather than Grand Masters, in the period 1805 to 1879, when Pope Leo XIII restored a Grand Master to the order. This signaled the renewal of the order's fortunes as a humanitarian and religious organization. On 19 September 1806, the Swedish government offered the sovereignty of the island of Gotland to the Order. The offer was rejected since it would have meant the Order renouncing their claim to Malta.  Remnants  View from Valletta, Malta, showing Fort Saint Angelo, belonging to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In August 2013, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced that the Hospitaller hospital, built between 1099 and 1291 had been rediscovered in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. It had been able to accommodate up to 2,000 patients, who came from all religious groups, and Jewish patients received kosher food. It also served as an orphanage, with these children often becoming Hospitallers when adult. The remaining vaulted area was discovered during excavations for a restaurant, and the preserved building will be incorporated in the project. Successors of the Knights Hospitaller The entities generally considered to maintain historical continuity with the Knights are the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, based in Rome and recognized by over 100 countries worldwide, as well as the chivalric orders in the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem: the Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Chivalric Order of Saint John of the Hospital at Jerusalem, Johanniter Orde in Nederland, Order of Saint John in Sweden, and the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. Sovereign Military Order of Malta In 1834, the order settled in Rome. Hospital work, the original work of the order, became once again its main concern. The Order's hospital and welfare activities, undertaken on a considerable scale in World War I, were greatly intensified and expanded in World War II under the Grand Master Fra' Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere (Grand Master 1931‚Äì1951). Coat of arms of the Order of Malta The Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, better known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), is a Roman Catholic lay religious order and the world's oldest surviving order of chivalry. Its sovereign status is recognised by membership in numerous international bodies and observer status at the United Nations and others.{} The Order maintains diplomatic relations with 107 countries, official relations with 6 others and with the European Union, permanent observer missions to the United Nations and its specialised agencies, and delegations or representations to many other international organizations. It issues its own passports, currency, stamps and even vehicle registration plates. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has a permanent presence in 120 countries, with 12 Grand Priories and Sub-Priories and 47 national Associations, as well as numerous hospitals, medical centres, day care centres, first aid corps, and specialist foundations, which operate in 120 countries. Its 13,500 members and 80,000 volunteers and over 42,000 medical personnel ‚Äì doctors, nurses and paramedics ‚Äì are dedicated to the care of the poor, the sick, the elderly, the disabled, the homeless, terminal patients, lepers, and all those who suffer. The Order is especially involved in helping victims of armed conflicts and natural disasters by providing medical assistance, caring for refugees, and distributing medicines and basic equipment for survival. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta established a mission in Malta, after signing an agreement with the Maltese Government which granted the Order the exclusive use of Fort St. Angelo for a term of 99 years. Today, after restoration, the Fort hosts historical and cultural activities related to the Order of Malta.  Order of Saint John  Prince Oskar of Prussia, Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Chivalric Order of Saint John of the hospital at Jerusalem Herrenmeister since 1999 During the Reformation, German commanderies of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg (located chiefly in the Margraviate of Brandenburg) declared their continued adherence to the Order of Saint John even as their knights converted to evangelical Christianity. Continuing to the present day as the Order of Saint John of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, this forms an order of chivalry under the protection of the Federal Republic and with its Herrenmeister (\\"Lord of the Knights\\") almost always a scion of the House of Hohenzollern (currently, Prince Oscar of Prussia). From Germany, this Protestant branch has spread by membership into other countries in Europe (including Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, France, Austria, the United Kingdom, and Italy), North America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Chile), Africa (Namibia, South Africa), Asia, and Australia. The commanderies of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg in the Netherlands (which originated in the Middle Ages) and Sweden became independent of the Bailiwick after the Second World War and now are independent orders under the protection of their respective monarchs; King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands is an Honorary Commander of the Order of Saint John in the Netherlands, and the Order of St John in Sweden is protected by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. All three Protestant orders, the German, Dutch, and Swedish, are in formalised co-operation as members of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem, founded in 1961 by the Order of Saint John of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg. (As well as originating with the mediaeval Knights Hospitaller, these three orders meet the traditional conditions for dynastic orders of chivalry under the legitimate fount of honour of each nation, and thus enjoy recognition by the privately operated and funded International Commission on Orders of Chivalry as of 2016.) The Protestant orders remain independent of, though co-operative with, the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta.  Most Venerable Order of Saint John  In England, almost all the property of the Knights Hospitaller was confiscated by King Henry VIII through the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the Reformation. Though not formally suppressed, this effectively caused the activities of the English Langue of the order to come to an end. In 1831, however, a British order was recreated by European aristocrats claiming (possibly without authority) to be acting on behalf of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. This order in time became known as the Most Venerable Order of Saint John, receiving a royal charter from Queen Victoria in 1888, before expanding throughout the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth, and the United States. Today, the best-known activities of this order are the St John Ambulance Brigade in Britain and the Commonwealth and the Saint John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem. The Most Venerable Order of Saint John has maintained a presence in Malta since the late 19th century. In contrast with the orders originating with the medieval Knights Hospitaller, the British organisation no longer limits its membership to Christians. Self-styled orders Several other organizations claim with their own sources to have evolved from the Knights Hospitaller but all are subject to international dispute and lack recognition. The Russian Tradition was recognized by the Pope with Tsar Paul I becoming Grand Master. The British resented this decision as it could have given Russia access to the Mediterranean through a claim over Malta. Britain said that the decision of the Pope was not official. The Holy See later retracted its decision stating a number of conflicts with Tsar Paul I, since he did not follow the precepts binding the Grand Master: he was married and not celibate; he had never been to Malta and declined to live there; and he was not a Roman Catholic. Several other orders have made claims over the Order of St John since the 19th century. Each order, including the Russian Tradition, generally use their interpretation of sources to present and claim a particular history of events. No independent sources support any superseding order of the Knights Hospitaller, all of which use either non-primary or self-published, non-peer- reviewed sources in support of their claims of legitimacy. The Order came to an end either shortly after the 1798 expulsion of the knights from Malta, or soon after the Russian revolution in the early 20th century. Following the end of World War II, and taking advantage of the lack of State Orders in the Italian Republic, an Italian called himself a Polish Prince and did a brisk trade in Maltese crosses as the Grand Prior of the fictitious \\"Grand Priory of Podolia\\" until successfully prosecuted for fraud. Another fraud claimed to be the Grand Prior of the Holy Trinity of Villeneuve, but gave up after a police visit, although the organisation resurfaced in Malta in 1975, and then by 1978 in the US, where it still continues. The large passage fees collected by the American Association of SMOM in the early 1950s may well have tempted Charles Pichel to create his own \\"Sovereign Order of St John of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitaller\\" in 1956. Pichel avoided the problems of being an imitation of SMOM by giving his organization a mythical history, claiming that the American organisation he led had been founded within the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller in 1908: a spurious claim, but which nevertheless misled many including some academics. In truth, the foundation of his organisation had no connection to the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller. Once created, the attraction of Russian Nobles into membership of Pichel's 'Order' lent some plausibility to his claims. These organisations have led to scores of other self-styled orders. Another self-styled Order, based in the US, gained a substantial following under leadership of the late Robert Formhals, who for some years, and with the support of historical organisations such as The Augustan Society, claimed to be a Polish prince of the House of Sanguszko. Hierarchy The first in the hierarchy of command was the Grand Master, or commander-in-chief, followed by the Grand Commander, who after 1304 came from the Grand Priory of St Gilles and who took the place of the Grand Master in case of his absence or death. The third-highest rank was that of the Marshal of the Hospital, whose main duty was to prepare the order for war. This included the procurement of armour, weapons, mounts with all the required equine equipment, and artillery with all it entails (ordnance, powder, ammunitions). The Marshal could on occasion be given command by the Grand Master or the Grand Commander.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry.Williamson and Bujeiro 2004, pp. 3‚Äì4. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht‚Äîthe Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)‚Äîas well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD‚ÄîReich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of the Third Reich.Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 113‚Äì460, 483, 485‚Äì487, 492, 494, 498‚Äì499, 501, 503, 509.

Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Scherzer 2007, pp. 117‚Äì186. Listed here are the seven Knight's Cross recipients whose last name starts with \\"Q\\".Fellgiebel 2000, p. 347. The recipients are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded. Background The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (), based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized. Recipients The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists for the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.Fellgiebel 2000, p. 112. Of the seven awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \\"Q\\", two presentations were made posthumously.

Over Tyler's next 31 games as a starter, LSU went 26-5, including a #12 ranking in the 1996 final AP Poll and a #13 ranking in the 1997 final AP Poll (it was the first time LSU had finished in the final AP Poll since 1988). Major victories during that time included unranked LSU's 28-0 victory over #14 Arkansas in 1995 (televised by ABC), #21 LSU's 19-15 victory at #14 Auburn in 1996 (televised by ESPN), and, most notably, #14 LSU's 28-21 victory over #1 Florida in 1997 (televised by ESPN). In the victory over #1 Florida, Tyler ran for two touchdowns off the option play, including one for 40 yards and one for 11 yards. However, during Tyler's last 7 games as a starter, LSU went 1-6. In his last game as a starter, at #10 Notre Dame, Tyler suffered a hamstring injury. Because of that, he was not able to start in the last game of his senior year at #13 Arkansas. A mobile quarterback, Tyler passed for 5,876 yards and 40 touchdowns and rushed for 778 yards and 23 touchdowns during his time at LSU.See the individual season statistics at www.lsusports.net Professional career In 2001, Tyler was the quarterback for the Baton Rouge Blaze. After the Blaze went defunct at the end of the season, Tyler became the quarterback for the now-defunct Houma Bayou Bucks of the National Indoor Football League.

Karaƒëorƒëe led the Serbian Revolution that sought to liberate Serbia from the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Serbian nationalism asserts that Serbs are a nation and promotes the cultural unity of Serbs. It is an ethnic nationalism, originally arising in the context of the general rise of nationalism in the Balkans under Ottoman rule, under the influence of Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá and Serbian statesman Ilija Gara≈°anin. Serbian nationalism was an important factor during the Balkan Wars which contributed to the decline of the Ottoman Empire, during and after World War I when it contributed to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and again during the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. After 1878, Serbian nationalists merged their goals with those of Yugoslavists, and emulated the Piedmont's leading role in the Risorgimento of Italy, by claiming that Serbia sought not only to unite all Serbs in one state, but that Serbia intended to be a South Slavic Piedmont that would unite all South Slavs in one state known as Yugoslavia. Serbian nationalists supported a centralized Yugoslav state that guaranteed the unity of the Serbs while resisting efforts to decentralize the state. The Vidovdan Constitution adopted by Yugoslavia in 1921 consolidated the country as a centralized state under the Serbian Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá monarchy. Croatian nationalists opposed the centralized state and demanded decentralization and an autonomous Croatia within Yugoslavia, which was accepted by the Yugoslav government in the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement of 1939. Serbian nationalists opposed the agreement on the grounds that it weakened the unity of Serbdom, asserting its importance to Yugoslavia with the slogan \\"Strong Serbdom, Strong Yugoslavia\\". The invasion and partition of Yugoslavia in World War II resulted in violent ethnic conflict between nationalist Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, and others, resulting in a highly violent sectarian variant of Serbian nationalism rising in the Chetnik movement. The decentralization of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1960s and the suppression of all ethnic nationalist sentiments led to a Serbian nationalist backlash and resurgence in the 1980s, that condemned post-World War II Yugoslavism and the decentralization of Yugoslavia. Upon Yugoslavia collapsing in the 1990s with multiple republics seeking secession, Serbian nationalists demanded that all Serbs in all the Yugoslav republics had the right to be united in a common state, ethnic conflict occurred between Serbs seeking unity with Serbia and other Yugoslav ethnicities seeking independence. History Serbian Revolution The origins of Serbian nationalism date back to the 19th century, beginning with the 1804 uprisings by Serbs against Ottoman rule that eventually led to the creation of an independent Serbian state in 1878. However, Serbian nationalists themselves cite the origins of the movement as being the Battle of Kosovo on the Serbian national and religious holiday Vidovdan (Saint Vitus Day) in 1389 between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire, the battle that holds important symbolic meaning to Serbian nationalists. The Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá is considered by some authors to be the father of Serbian nationalism. Karad≈æiƒá created a linguistic definition of the Serbs that included all speakers of the ≈†tokavian dialect regardless of their religious affiliation or geographical origin. However, Karad≈æiƒá acknowledged the right of some ≈†tokavian-speaking peoples to call themselves names other than Serbs. German historian Michael Weithmann considers that Karad≈æiƒá expressed ideological and political idea in scientific shape i.e. that all southern Slavs are Serbs while Czech historian Jan Rychlik consider that Karad≈æiƒá became a propagator of greater Serbian ideology and uttered a theory according to which are all Yugoslav people talking shtokavian dialect Serbs.Maro≈° Melich√°rek, 2015, The role of Vuk.

Battle of Kosovo (1870), painting by Adam Stefanoviƒá, a depiction of the Battle of Kosovo of 1389 After Serbia was recognized as an independent state in 1878, both South Slavs and the Serbian government considered their peoples in Habsburg-ruled Austria- Hungary to be under occupation, resulting in increasing antagonism between Serbia and Austria-Hungary from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.  World War I  In 1914 Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by Bosnian Serb revolutionary Gavrilo Princip, resulting in Austria-Hungary accusing Serbia of involvement and subsequently declaring war on Serbia, resulting in a clash of alliances and the eruption of World War I. In spite of heavy casualties, Serbia benefited from Allies' victory against Germany and Austria-Hungary, with Serbia subsequently joining with territories claimed by Yugoslav nationalists to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, informally known as Yugoslavia, in 1918. Serbian nationalists associated with a centralist vision of Yugoslavia as opposed to a confederal or federal state as advocated by non-Serbs. The antagonism between a centralized Yugoslavia supported by Serbian nationalists and a decentralized Yugoslavia supported by Croatian and Slovenian nationalists was the main cause of unstable governance in Yugoslavia during the interwar period. Yugoslavia In 1920, the centralized vision of Yugoslavia as supported by Serbian nationalists was enacted in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes passed on Serbian national and religious holiday Vidovdan (Saint Vitus Day) that became known as the \\"Vidovdan Constitution\\" or \\"St. Vitus Day Constitution\\" (–í–∏–¥–æ–≤–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞–≤ / Vidovdanski ustav). Antagonism which rose between Serbian nationalists versus Croatian and Slovenian nationalists culminated in the 1928 assassination of Stjepan Radiƒá on the floor of the Yugoslav parliament and the subsequent deterioration of parliamentary democracy in the country. In the aftermath King Alexander discarded the St. Vitus Day Constitution, proclaimed a royal dictatorship, and officially renamed the country Kingdom of Yugoslavia. King Alexander pursued a policy of encouraging modern Yugoslav nationalism which caused dissatisfaction amongst Serbian nationalists who saw Yugoslav nationalism as a disavowal of Serbian nationalism. Serbian nationalists were outraged at the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement between Serb and Croat political leaders that created the Banovina of Croatia, an autonomous province within the kingdom which gave Croatia virtual autonomy. In response, Serbian nationalists founded the Serb Cultural Club which attacked the new Yugoslav nationalism under the motto of \\"Strong Serbdom, Strong Yugoslavia\\". Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, Yugoslav Serb general Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by the Axis Powers during World War II, with Nazi Germany establishing puppet states throughout occupied Yugoslavia. Serbian nationalism rose in a militant response by the Chetnik forces of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá against both the Axis forces and the communist Yugoslav Partisans. The war saw the rise of an extreme anti-Muslim variant of Serbian nationalism practised by the Chetniks who massacred Bosnian Muslims during the war. In the aftermath of World War II and the seizure of power by the Yugoslav Partisans, Josip Broz Tito's communist Yugoslavia was established. The new regime repressed nationalism of any culture that was deemed to be a threat to the state. Serbian nationalism then developed during the 1960s by intellectuals such as Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá and challenged the state-sponsored policies of Yugoslavism and \\"Brotherhood and Unity\\". Tito's later expulsion of the nationalist-leaning Serbian communist official Aleksandar Rankoviƒá in the 1960s was perceived as an attack on Serbian nationalism. After the ousting of Rankoviƒá, Serbian nationalist intellectuals increasingly began viewing Yugoslavia as a detrimental experience for the Serb nation. Serbian nationalism escalated following the death of Tito in 1980.Ramet 2006, 322. Serbian intellectuals began breaking a number of taboos‚Äîfor example, Branko Petranoviƒá identified Mihailoviƒá, the Chetnik rival of Tito during World War II as being an important \\"anti-fascist\\". Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá joined other Serb political writers in writing the highly controversial Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts of 1986. The Memorandum claimed to promote solutions to restore Yugoslav unity, but it focused on fiercely condemning Titoist Yugoslavia of having economically subjugated Serbia to Croatia and Slovenia and accused ethnic Albanians of committing genocide against Serbs in Kosovo. The Memorandum was harshly condemned by the ruling League of Communists of Yugoslavia as well as the government of Serbia led by Ivan Stamboliƒá. Members who would later support Serbian nationalism chose follow the party line and denounced the Memorandum as well. Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, at the time a Serbian communist official, did not speak publicly about the issue, but in a meeting with members of the secret police he formally endorsed the official government denouncement of the Memorandum, stating: > The appearance of the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences > represents nothing else but the darkest nationalism. It means the > liquidation of the current socialist system of our country, that is the > disintegration after which there is no survival for any nation or > nationality. ... Tito's policy of brotherhood and unity ... is the only > basis on which Yugoslavia‚Äôs survival can be secured. Breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav Wars However, amidst the rising nationalist sentiment in Serbia in 1987, Milo≈°eviƒá became their major spokesperson in the communist establishment. Milo≈°eviƒá supported the premises of the Memorandum that included promoting centralization of power in the federal Yugoslav government to decrease the powers of the republics and autonomous provinces and a nationalist motto of \\"strong Serbia, strong Yugoslavia\\". During the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution, Milo≈°eviƒá urged Serbians and Montenegrins to \\"take to the streets\\" and utilized the slogan \\"Strong Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia\\" that drew support from Serbs but alienated Bosnian Muslims, Croats, Kosovo Albanians, Macedonians, and Slovenes. To these groups, Milo≈°eviƒá's agenda reminded them of the Serb hegemonic political affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Rankoviƒá's policies. Milo≈°eviƒá and his supporters appealed to nationalist and populist passion by speaking of Serbia's importance to the world and using aggressive and violent political rhetoric, in a Belgrade speech on 19 November 1988, he spoke of Serbia as facing battles against both internal and external enemies. In Vojvodina, pro- Milo≈°eviƒá demonstrators that included 500 Kosovo Serbs and local Serbs demonstrated at the provincial capital, accusing the leadership in Vojvodina of supporting separatism and for being \\"traitors\\". In August 1988, meetings by supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were held in many locations in Serbia and Montenegro, with increasingly violent nature, with calls being heard such as \\"Give us arms!\\", \\"We want weapons!\\", \\"Long live Serbia‚Äîdeath to Albanians!\\", and \\"Montenegro is Serbia!\\". In the same month, Milo≈°eviƒá began efforts designed to destabilize the governments in Montenegro and Bosnia- Herzegovina to allow him to install his followers in those republics. By 1989, Milo≈°eviƒá and his supporters controlled Central Serbia along with the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, supporters in the leadership of Montenegro, and agents of the Serbian security service were pursuing efforts to destabilize the government in Bosnia & Herzegovina. In 1989, Serbian media began to speak of \\"the alleged imperilment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\", as tensions between Serbs and Bosnian Muslims and Croats increased over Serbs' support for Milo≈°eviƒá. Efforts to spread the cult of personality of Milo≈°eviƒá into the republic of Macedonia began in 1989 with slogans, graffiti, and songs glorifying Milo≈°eviƒá spreading in the republic. Furthermore, Milo≈°eviƒá proposed a law to restore land titles held by Serbs in the interwar period that effectively provided a legal basis for large numbers of Serbs to move to Kosovo and Macedonia to regain those lands while displacing the Albanian residents there. Beginning in 1989, Milo≈°eviƒá had given support to Croatian Serbs who were vouching for the creation of an autonomous province for Croatia's Serbs that was opposed by Croatia's communist authorities. In the late 1980s Milo≈°eviƒá allowed the mobilization of Serb nationalist organizations to go unhindered by actions from the Serbian government, with Chetniks holding demonstrations, and the Serbian government embraced the Serbian Orthodox Church and restored its legitimacy in Serbia. Milo≈°eviƒá and the Serbian government supported a tricameral legislature, that would include a Chamber of Citizens to represent the population of Yugoslavia, a system that would give Serbs a majority; a Chamber of Provinces and Republics to represent regional affairs; and a Chamber of Associated Labour. Serbia's specific endorsement of a Chamber of Citizens and a Chamber of Associated Labour faced opposition from the republics of Croatia and Slovenia as they saw the proposals as increasing Serbia's power and federal state control over the economy, which was the opposite of their intention to decrease federal state control over the economy. Slovenia staunchly opposed the Milo≈°eviƒá government's plans and promoted its own reforms that would make Yugoslavia a decentralized confederation. Croatia and Slovenia denounced the actions by Milo≈°eviƒá and began to demand that Yugoslavia be made a full multi- party confederal state. Milo≈°eviƒá claimed that he opposed a confederal system but also declared that should a confederal system be created, the external borders of Serbia would be an \\"open question\\", insinuating that his government would pursue creating an enlarged Serbian federal republic if Yugoslavia was decentralized. In 1989, the autonomy of SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina were de facto abolished by constitutional reforms that transferred powers away from the provinces to the Serbian government. Milo≈°eviƒá rejected the independence of Croatia in 1991, and even after the formation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), it too did not initially recognize Croatia's independence. Plans by Milo≈°eviƒá to carve out territory from Croatia to the local Serbs had begun by June 1990, according to the diary of Serbian official Borisav Joviƒá. The Serbian government along with a clique of pro-Milo≈°eviƒá members of the Yugoslav army and its general staff, secretly adopted the RAM or \\"frame\\" plan that involved the partition of Croatia and Bosnia to give large amounts of territory to the local Serbs that would remain united with Serbia, effectively a Greater Serbia. Armaments and military equipment were placed in strategic positions throughout Croatia and Bosnia for use by the Serbs, and local Serbs were trained as police and paramilitary soldiers in preparation for war. Interviews with government officials involved in political affairs between Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia have revealed that Milo≈°eviƒá planned to arrest the Republic of Macedonia's political leadership and replace it with politicians loyal to Serbia, when the Republic of Macedonia was still part of Yugoslavia. Upon the Republic of Macedonia seceding in 1991, the Serbian government declared that Macedonia was an \\"artificial nation\\" and Serbia allied with Greece against the Republic of Macedonia, even suggesting a partition of the Republic of Macedonia between Serbia and Greece. Milo≈°eviƒá demanded the self-determination of Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia and did not recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia until 1996. Serbian nationalists claim that in Communist historiography, Serbs were transformed into oppressors, the Chetniks of World War II branded as collaborationist as the Usta≈°e, and the massacres of Serbs were downplayed.

He has acted in Almqvist's Drottningens juvelsmycke, Bulgakov's M√§staren och Margarita (The Master and Margarita), Brecht's Tolvskillingsoperan (The Threepenny Opera), Botho Strauss' Rummet och tiden, Moli√®re's Misantropen (Le Misanthrope) and Brecht's Den goda m√§nniskan i Sezuan (The Good Person of Szechwan). He has also performed frequently in theatre productions for children, most recently in the adaption of Elsa Beskow's children's story Petter och Lotta p√• stora landsv√§gen (2005 & 2006). Bergman has gained a reputation as a character actor. He has appeared in TV and film roles in a number of well-known productions, including as Aron in Fanny and Alexander, and as a cigar-loving salesman in Kan du vissla Johanna? (1994), traditionally shown each Christmas Eve in Sweden. He has also played the antique expert Erik Johansson in TV series Berlinder auktioner (2003) and a teacher in the Swedish film Ondskan (Evil), in 2003. More recently he has been playing the dry-witted forensic detective Nyberg in the Swedish crime films about Det. Insp. Kurt Wallander, with Krister Henriksson in the lead (32 episodes).

HM The Queen is the patron. The RFS has a broad membership which includes woodland owners, managers, countryside professionals (land agents, ecologists, conservationists), academics, students and others with a general interest in woodland management. Membership is open to all.  History  The Royal Forestry Society was established in 1882 in Northumberland, England. Originally known as the English Arboricultural Society, the organisation was founded by forester Henry Clark and nurseryman John W Robson, both from Hexham. The Society's first President was John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham. In 1905 it was granted a Royal Charter by King Edward VII and was renamed the Royal English Arboricultural Society. It was renamed The Royal English Forestry Society in 1931, and in 1962 its title was changed to the Royal Forestry Society of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A separate organisation operates in Scotland, the Royal Scottish Forestry Society, which was established in 1854. Woodlands A Wellingtonia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) sapling, planted in Hockeridge Woods in 2015 by Mary Wellesley, great-great-granddaughter of the Duke of Wellington, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo Although the Society is not a major woodland owner, it manages three working woodlands: *Hockeridge and Pancake Woods in the Chilterns, on the Hertfordshire/Buckinghamshire border and close to Berkhamsted and Chesham, gifted to the RFS in 1986 by Mary Wellesley, great-great-granddaughter of the Duke of Wellington; *a woodland in the National Forest, close to Battram in Leicestershire; *Charles Ackers Redwood Grove and Naylor Pinetum at Leighton Hall, Powys near Welshpool, Powys, the largest and oldest grove of coast redwoods in Europe. These are managed as examples of good practice and lessons learned are shared with members. { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"title\\": \\"Headquarters\\", \\"description\\": \\"alt=Upton House\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"building\\", \\"marker-size\\": \\"medium\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"c00\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -1.468213,52.1087231 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"title\\": \\"Hockeridge Woods and Pancake Woods\\", \\"description\\": \\"alt=Hockeridge Woods\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"park\\", \\"marker-size\\": \\"medium\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"093\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -0.5858,51.7452 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"title\\": \\"Battram Wood\\", \\"description\\": \\"alt=Battram Wood\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"park\\", \\"marker-size\\": \\"medium\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"093\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -1.3783037,52.6814742 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"title\\": \\"Charles Ackers Redwood Grove and Naylor Pinetum\\", \\"description\\": \\"alt=Leighton Hall from the air\\", \\"marker- symbol\\": \\"park\\", \\"marker-size\\": \\"medium\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"093\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -3.122577,52.633531 ] } }, ] }  Activities  Hockeridge Woods in early autumn The Society has 20 Divisions which between them organise up to 100 woodland field meetings a year on topics that span seed to sawmill. Annually: a top-level conference is held; there is a 4 or 5 day woodland study tour in England, Wales or Northern Ireland; Excellence in Forestry Awards take place, there is a travel bursary for forestry study abroad, and workshops, seminars and knowledge transfer events. Overseas study tours are held every other year. The RFS helps shape formal forestry qualifications and its own Certificate of Arboriculture is recognised across the sector; it encourages students with a range of awards, bursaries and internships; has launched a research programme with colleges and has partnered with a number of organisations to help share knowledge. A professional qualification is offered by the RFS, the Professional Diploma of Arboriculture. The RFS Teaching Trees project is expanding, introducing primary schools and their pupils to their local woodlands and their benefits to the economy, environment and society. The RFS maintains a library of forestry related books for members. The society is headquartered in the grounds of Upton House, Warwickshire, near Banbury.

The fell reaches a height of 469 m (1,540 ft) and divides the valleys of Great Langdale and Little Langdale. The fell's name originates from the Old Norse word lyng meaning ‚Äúheather covered‚Äù. The actual summit of the fell is named as Brown How on Ordnance Survey maps. Topography Although it is surrounded by higher and better-known fells, Lingmoor Fell is quite separate and distinct with no connecting ridges to other fells, giving it a considerable (for such a small fell) topographic prominence of 245 metres (804 feet), making it a Marilyn hill. Lingmoor Fell has a subsidiary top, known as Side Pike (362 m, 1,187 ft), which lies 1.5 kilometres (0.9 miles) to the north-west. This is a fine rock tower accessible only from the west and south. Walkers wishing to visit Side Pike from Lingmoor Fell are blocked by unassailable crags and must traverse round to easier slopes to the south. The fell's northern and eastern flanks are clothed in deciduous woodland up to the 200-metre contour, and there are also patches of heather and bracken on these lower slopes. Lingmoor Tarn, an attractive mountain lake about 200 metres (about 650 feet) in length with a couple of small islands, lies 600 metres (about 650 yards) north of the summit. One kilometre (0.6 miles) north of the summit of the fell stands another topographic feature; this is the detached rock pinnacle of Oak Howe Needle. The needle is part of Oak Howe Crag, a popular climbing location on the fell, with over ten routes on Rhyolite crags. Geology The summit area is formed from a large sill of andesite, overlying the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Lingmoor Fell Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Quarrying Lingmoor Fell's north- eastern slopes above the villages of Elterwater and Chapel Stile have long been quarried for its high-quality Westmorland green slate. The Burlington quarry at Elterwater has been worked for over 300 years and is still in production today, turning out over 800 tonnes of slate annually. Many of the quarries have closed over the years and the crags are now used by rock climbers. Ascents Lingmoor Fell can be climbed either from Elterwater in Great Langdale or from the Blea Tarn car park in Little Langdale (grid reference ). The latter route makes use of an old quarry track for much of the way. The Elterwater route can be slightly confusing in its early stages as there are a jumble of paths through the lower woodland and quarries, the route becomes clear once the open fell has been reached. Summit The summit of the fell is crossed by a high dry stone wall, which in fact traverses the entire spine of the fell, starting at the eastern foot and terminating abruptly at the crags below Side Pike in the west before re-commencing on the plateau. Lingmoor Fell, Langdale Pikes, and all of the high fells around the head of Great Langdale can be viewed from the summit, as can Coniston Fells to the south-west.

A contemporary and good friend of George Washington, Fairfax made opportunities for the younger Washington through his powerful family. Early life and education Fairfax was born in 1724 on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. He was the son of Sarah (n√©e Walker), and her husband Sir William Fairfax, a British colonel who had served as an English Customs agent in Barbados, as well as a justice and Governor of the Bahamas. At his son's birth, William was working as the Customs Collector in Marblehead. Sarah's father Thomas Walker was Chief Justice of the Bahamas. In addition to George, the Fairfaxes had two daughters, Anne and Sarah. The father William was first cousin to Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. William's wife Sarah died January 21, 1731.Mario Valdes, \\"The Fairfaxes and George Washington\\", The Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families, Frontline, PBS. Note: Valdes interprets historical documents as suggesting that Sarah Walker was of partial African descent from her maternal line. Her husband Fairfax was concerned about the progress of his mixed-race children in the world. Valdes has found that a later descendant tried to cover up this aspect of the family's history by eliminating parts of letters when quoting family documents. At Lord Fairfax's request, the senior Fairfax was reassigned to the colony of Virginia as customs agent. There he became a lieutenant of the County of Fairfax, and member and president of the council in Virginia (equivalent to lieutenant governor). William Fairfax also worked as a land agent for his cousin Lord Fairfax, managing his extensive holdings in the Northern Neck of Virginia. Genealogists remain unclear as to the origins of George William Fairfax's mother, Sarah Walker, and whether she might have possibly been of mixed race. In a letter to his mother, William Fairfax appeared to have worried about the reception of the boy by the London Fairfax family when he sent him to England. > Col. Gale has indeed kindly offered to take the care of safe conducting my > eldest son George, upwards of seven years old but I judged it too forward to > send him before I had your's or some one of his Uncles' or Aunts' > invitation, altho' I have no reason to doubt any of their indulgences to a > poor West India boy especially as he has the marks in his visage that will > always testify his parentage. \\"West India\\" was a term used synonymously with Creole, which denoted native- born as much as it did mixed race in the period. After William Fairfax moved his family to Virginia, George William became a friend of George Washington, who was eight years younger. They remained friends until Fairfax's death in 1787. Fairfax's older sister Anne married George Washington's older half- brother Lawrence in 1743, when George Washington was eleven years old. Fairfax arranged for the younger Washington to help him to survey the Virginia lands of his cousin, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. This gave him a working introduction into Virginia society Marriage and family In 1748, George William married Sally Cary, who came from one of Virginia's oldest and wealthiest families. Sally was apparently one of the most attractive women in Virginia at the time and she had a close friendship with George Washington, who lived at the neighboring plantation, Mount Vernon.Thomas Fleming \\"George Washington in Love,\\" American Heritage, Fall 2009. Career In 1757 after the death of his father, George William Fairfax inherited the Belvoir plantation. His cousin Lord Fairfax moved to the Shenandoah Valley in 1752, fixing his residence at Greenway Court near White Post in Clarke County, at the suggestion of Thomas Bryan Martin. Thomas Kemp Cartmell, Shenandoah Valley Pioneers and Their Descendants, p. 245 As George William Fairfax was a mentor to the young George Washington, the younger man spent considerable time at Belvoir before his marriage to Martha Dandridge Custis in 1759. From letters that have survived, it seems that Washington had fallen in love with Sally Cary before his own marriage.Thomas Fleming \\"George Washington in Love,\\" American Heritage, Fall 2009. George William and his wife Sally Fairfax did not have any children. They returned to England in 1773, prior to the events of the American Revolutionary War, to take care of a family property matter. Fairfax was a Loyalist. He directed his friend Washington to rent Belvoir and sell some of his property, including slaves. The Fairfaxes did not return to Virginia afterward. In 1774 Washington wrote to George William Fairfax with an account of actions related to his business and property affairs in Virginia; with political tensions on the rise, he assured Fairfax he was keeping quiet about his friend's plans not to return to the colony. Washington also wrote of the Virginia governor's dissolution of the 1774 Virginia Assembly for passing a resolution critical of his office and the Crown, and news of tensions in the northern colonies.\\"Letter from George Washington to George William Fairfax, July 1774\\", The Road to Revolution, The Documents of George Washington, University of Virginia, accessed 13 November 2011 The two men continued to correspond during the buildup to war.\\"George Washington letter to William Fairfax, 31 May 1775\\", excerpted from The Writings of George Washington, Vol II, edited by Jared Sparks, 1847; at Family Tales Website References External links * \\"Letter from George Washington to George William Fairfax, May 31, 1775\\", American Memory, Library of Congress * Category:1729 births Category:1787 deaths Category:18th-century American Episcopalians Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:American planters Category:British North American Anglicans Category:Cary family of Virginia George William Category:Loyalists in the American Revolution from Virginia Category:People from Fairfax County, Virginia Category:People from Marblehead, Massachusetts Category:American people of Bahamian descent ","title":"George William Fairfax"},{"id":"8056148","text":"In the theory of differential forms, a differential ideal I is an algebraic ideal in the ring of smooth differential forms on a smooth manifold, in other words a graded ideal in the sense of ring theory, that is further closed under exterior differentiation d. In other words, for any form Œ± in I, the exterior derivative dŒ± is also in I. In the theory of differential algebra, a differential ideal I in a differential ring R is an ideal which is mapped to itself by each differential operator.  Exterior differential systems and partial differential equations  An exterior differential system consists of a smooth manifold M and a differential ideal : I\\\\subset \\\\Omega^*(M) . An integral manifold of an exterior differential system (M,I) consists of a submanifold N\\\\subset M having the property that the pullback to N of all differential forms contained in I vanishes identically. One can express any partial differential equation system as an exterior differential system with independence condition. Suppose that we have a kth order partial differential equation system for maps u: \\\\mathbb{R}^m \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^n, given by : F^r(x, u, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{|I|}u }{\\\\partial x^I})=0, \\\\quad 1\\\\le |I|\\\\le k .

This idea allows one to analyze the properties of partial differential equations with methods of differential geometry. For instance, we can apply the Cartan‚ÄìK√§hler_theorem to a system of partial differential equations by writing down the associated exterior differential system. We can frequently apply Cartan's equivalence method to exterior differential systems to study their symmetries and their diffeomorphism invariants.

A given plant may have one or more stems, and the plants are sometimes short-lived, dying after flowering only once, even though the species is acknowledged to be perennial. Lower leaves are typically petioled or tapered, but mostly spiny-lobed; petioles are either spiny-lobed or toothed. Inflorescences are characterized by prickly heads more or less grouped in a panicle-like cluster, closely subtended by the higher leaves. Involucres are either hemispheric or bell-shaped, with purple to green coloration. Phyllaries range from a lanceolate to ovate shape. There are characteristically many flowers with white, pink or lavender corollae about 20 millimeters in length. Anther bases are sharply sagittate, with oblong tips; the ends of the styles manifest a somewhat swollen node, with a cylindrical superior appendage. The smooth brownish fruits are four to five millimeters in diameter, but distinctly ovoid; many pappus bristles are exhibited.

Career  V√§likangas studied architecture at Helsinki University of Technology, qualifying as an architect in 1917. In 1921 he left on a study tour of Italy (as well as visiting the other Nordic countries, Germany, France and north Africa), a common practice at that time for architects in the Nordic countries who were turning away from National Romanticism. After qualifying V√§likangas worked in Yuzovka in Russia (present- day Donetsk in the Ukraine), but had to leave in a hurry with the onset of the Bolshevik Revolution. On his return, he worked for the Br√§nd√∂ Villastad company as well as in the architect's office of G√∂sta Jusl√©n and, from 1918 to 1920, in the office of Frosterus and Gripenberg. V√§likangas founded his own office in 1920, while also working elsewhere. Among his many other positions, he was chief architect at the National Board of Building from 1937 until the Winter War in 1940, from 1942 to 1944 he was head of the office responsible for post-war reconstruction, he acted as the director of the board responsible for the restoration of Turku Castle, he was the chief architect at the Helsinki Workers' Savings Bank, and from 1928 to 1930 he was Editor-in-Chief of the Finnish Architectural Review, in doing so influencing the spread of Modernist architecture in Finland. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki. The archives of Martti V√§likangas are in the possession of the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki.  Work  Turku Central railway station, 1940 \\"K√§til√∂opisto\\" Maternity Hospital, Helsinki, 1960 V√§likangas designed approximately 170 projects.Harri Hautaj√§rvi, \\"Martti V√§likangas: Housing and Banks for Workers\\", ARK, 6/1993, p.27 His most notable work is the Puu-K√§pyl√§ [‚Äòwood K√§pyl√§‚Äô] Garden Suburb in K√§pyl√§ on the then northern edge of Helsinki, built from 1920 to 1925, a commission he received at the age of 26. Puu-k√§pyl√§ was a model workers‚Äô housing area, built at a time when there was a bad housing problem for workers in the city. The construction follows the typical Finnish vernacular method: square-log construction then faced in weatherboarding. However, the whole process was partly industrialized, and the area is regarded as the first prefabricated housing area in Finland. The mostly 2-storey semi-detached timber houses are arranged around sheltered courtyards, where originally the tenants‚Äô vegetable gardens were sited. The colours vary slightly from one house to another, but with a dominance of traditional red ochre. K√§pyl√§ was threatened with demolition in the 1960s, and even V√§likangas himself drew up plans for the wooden housing to be replaced by a multi-storey development. The area has survived, however, though the working-class families are gradually being replaced by middle-class families and professional types, especially architects ‚Äì and it also has become a favourite tourist attraction. The Olympic Games were due to take place in Helsinki, in 1940 (but were cancelled due to the Second World War, to be held eventually in Helsinki in 1952), and V√§likangas participated in the design of the Olympic Village, together with architect Hilding Ekelund. V√§likangas also designed the Olympic Riding Hall. Other buildings designed by V√§likangas in Helsinki include: large apartment blocks Sturenkatu 40 (1926‚Äì27) and Hauhontie 4-8 (1924‚Äì25), the Helsinki V school (Apollonkatu 11), and apartment blocks at Eerikinkatu 15, Vuorikatu 9 and on Abrahaminkatu. Cinema theatre Orion (Eerikinkatu 15) represents a fine Art Deco interior. V√§likangas also designed a number of buildings in his home province, especially in the town of Mikkeli: the gate building of the Sports Park (1934), the bus station (1934), Harju Chapel (1937), an extension to the P√§√§maja School (1937), the Jama Commercial building and civic defence building (1938), and Savings Bank building (1940); and in the county of Savo: the Savonlinna Central Hospital, the Parkum√§ki Memorial (1929), and the Koikkala Church in Juva (1959). In 1940, V√§likangas and fellow architect V√§in√∂ V√§h√§kallio designed the 1940 Turku Central railway station.  Footnotes   References  *Nordic Classicism 1910-1930.

The route links Chatham and Sarnia via Wallaceburg, following close to the St. Clair River. The southern terminus is at Highway 401 south of Chatham, while the northern terminus is at Highway 402 in Sarnia. Highway 40 was built as a depression-relief project in 1934. The original routing followed what is now the St. Clair Parkway, but was rerouted to create that scenic road in the mid-1970s. The Sarnia Bypass was built between 1963 as Highway 40A and renumbered as Highway 40 by 1965; the original route through Sarnia became Highway 40B until it was decommissioned during the early-1990s. The route was extended to Highway 3 in Blenheim during the early 1970s; however this section would be the sole part of Highway 40 decommissioned during the Ontario highway transfers. The route is long.  Route description  271x271px Highway 40 begins at an interchange with Highway 401 (Exit 90) southeast of the urban centre of Chatham, within the Municipality of Chatham- Kent. Southwest of the interchange is C.M. Wilson Conservation Area, a campground named for the former Chair of Directors of the Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority, Clarence Michael Wilson. The highway proceeds northwest as Communication Road, passing between farmland on the outskirts of Chatham. It crosses a Canadian National Railway (CN) mainline followed by the Thames River, then turns southwest onto Grand Avenue East and crosses a Canadian Pacific (CP) railway line. The highway progresses from the outskirts of Chatham to downtown before turning onto St. Clair Street and travelling northwest. It encounters the Nortown Centre mall as it passes through the suburbs and eventually leaves the city. Between Chatham and Wallaceburg, Highway 40 divides a large swath of farmland established in the fertile soils of the region. The only community between the two places is Oungah, Ontario. Immediately southeast of Wallaceburg, the highway turns to the north and becomes known as Murray Street. As it enters the town, it turns onto McNaughton Avenue and crosses a CSX railway line then the Sydenham River. The route turns west onto Dufferin Avenue and proceeds out of the town, crossing the CSX railway a second time. After crossing an irrigation canal, Highway 40 turns north onto Arnold Road and crosses the CSX railway a third and final time before exiting Chatham‚ÄìKent. The route enters Lambton County in the municipality of St. Clair, passing through more farmland. north of the county line, the highway crosses the W. Darcy McKeough Floodway, a channel constructed in 1984 to protect Wallaceburg from flooding. Highway 40 continues north parallel to and several kilometres east of the St. Clair River. At Bickford, it swerves slightly to the east while passing between the CF Industries nitrogen fertilizer plant to the west and Bickford Oak Woods Provincial Conservation Reserve to the east. As the highway approaches the south end of Sarnia, it widens into a divided four lane expressway and passes through Chemical Valley, the location of several industrial plants. The route enters Aamjiwnaang First Nation at La Salle Line where the surroundings abruptly switch to forest from a mix of industry and farmland. At the intersection with Churchill Line, Highway 40 enters the Sarnia city limits and turns east onto the Sarnia Bypass, a four lane divided expressway. Approximately east of the intersection, the highway narrows back to a two lane road. Soon thereafter, it gently curves to the north, intersecting Plank Road and becoming Modeland Road. It passes along the western edge of the Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant, the world's largest photovoltaic (solar) power plant. The route passes above a CN and VIA rail line as it travels along the eastern rural‚Äìurban fringe of the city. After a signalized intersection with Wellington Street, Highway 40 widens to a divided four lane expressway once more just prior to a Parclo A2 interchange with London Line (former Highway 7), then ends at a Parclo B4 interchange with Highway 402 (Exit 6). Modeland Road narrows back to a two lane road and continues north as Lambton County Road 27. The African-Canadian Heritage Tour follows a portion of Highway 40, from the interchange with Highway 401 to Chatham-Kent Road 29 (Countryview Line) in Oungah, Ontario, midway between Chatham and Wallaceburg, where it turns east on to Chatham-Kent Road 29 towards Dresden.  History  Highway 40 was established at the height of the Great Depression, during the spring of 1934. The subsequent improvement of the roadway employed several dozen men eight hours per day, six days per week at minimum wage as a depression-relief project. Highway 40 was created by the assumption of several lengths of concession road created as a result of statute labour by adjacent farmers as part of the requirements to secure a land deed. On March 28, the road connecting Chatham with Wallaceburg was assumed by the Department of Highways (DHO) and designated King's Highway 40. Just over a month later, on May 2, the DHO assumed the route between Wallaceburg and Sarnia known today as the St. Clair Parkway. The route connected Highway 2 in Chatham with Highway 7 and Highway 22 in Sarnia.  Sarnia Bypass  In the decade following World War II, automobile use in North America increased dramatically, inundating many highways on the approach to and within urbanized areas with heavy traffic. As a result, freeways and bypasses were constructed throughout the province, allowing drivers not destined for those locations avoid congestion. In 1957, the DHO announced that Highway 402 would be extended east of Sarnia to London, starting with the construction of an interchange at Modeland Road. This interchange would serve as the terminus for a new bypass of Sarnia. On May 1, 1963, portions of Modeland Road and Churchill Line were taken over by the DHO and numbered as Highway 40A. These roads were reconstructed over the following year as a continuous divided highway. On October 25, 1963, the Sarnia Bypass was opened to traffic. By 1965, the bypass was renumbered as the northern end of Highway 40; the former route on the west side of Sarnia, via Brock Street, Vidal Street and Front Street, was subsequently renumbered Highway 40B. During the early 1970s, the province extended Highway 40 along Kent County Road 11, to meet with Highway 3 in Blenheim, Ontario, adding 17 km to the roadway's distance. East of the Murphy Road overpass, Highway 402 was re-aligned to bypass the original interchange with Highway 40 constructed in 1963; Exmouth Street was redirected to connect with Highway 7 (London Line) at that Parclo A2 junction, and Quinn Street now follows the former alignment of the freeway. For the realigned Highway 402, a new Parclo B4 interchange was constructed with Highway 40 just north of the original interchange.  St. Clair Parkway  During the late-1950s, the Saint Lawrence Seaway project created a navigable lock system between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Superior, while simultaneously reclaiming properties along the shoreline to create a continuous parkway. Seeing the potential tourist draw, several groups and organizations, including the district Chamber of Commerce, convened at the second annual conference of the Southwestern Ontario Chambers of Commerce and Boards of Trade in February 1960. Several resolutions were passed, calling for the DHO to create a new Highway 40 several kilometres inland from the St. Clair River and to have the old highway rebuilt as a scenic route. These resolutions were echoed by Lambton County Council and the 21 municipalities in the county. Plans for the parkway were crafted over the next several years before being presented to minister of highways Charles MacNaughton in the spring of 1965. Subsequently, the St. Clair Parkway Commission was formed in 1966. Construction of the new inland route of Highway 40 began in 1972. Working south from Sarnia, the first contract reached as far south as Highway 80, a distance of . A second contract, awarded in 1974, extended construction south an additional to Lambton County Road 2. Construction began in the early 1970s on a major realignment of Highway 40 between Wallaceburg and Sarnia. The old alignment of the road was bypassed by a newly constructed (and much straighter) road around 5 km inland from the St. Clair River. This new alignment of Highway 40 opened in stages in the mid-1970s. From roughly halfway between Highway 80 (now Lambton CR 80) and CR 4, to the Sarnia Bypass, the road was built as a four-lane divided highway. Once this new alignment was created, the road's length was , as around of the old alignment was bypassed. The old alignment was turned back from Sarnia to Sombra in 1979, from Sombra to Walpole Island in 1980, and finally from Walpole Island to Wallaceburg in 1984. It was named the St. Clair Parkway and designated as Lambton County Road 33 and Kent County Roads 32 & 33\\\\. The new (current) alignment of Highway 40 was built with a wide-enough right of way for future twinning to an expressway and upgrading to become a freeway, if the need ever arises. There are no private properties on Highway 40's new alignment, and the only access is at intersecting roads, or at traffic signal-governed intersections, with sufficient right-of-way for overpasses and interchanges if upgrading takes place. The entire Sarnia Bypass (along the south and east ends of Sarnia) is also built to this standard for relatively easy upgrading. At the moment, the only parts of the Bypass which are four-lane divided are the Michigan Avenue to Wellington Street stretch (a subsection of that which is up to fully controlled-access freeway standards runs between Wellington St and Highway 402), and the Indian Road to Churchill Road segment where the route runs east- west. From the signalized T-intersection on Churchill Road where Highway 40 changes direction from east-west, that portion of the north-south route to Wallaceburg is also four-lane divided until just south of Rokeby Line.  Downloading  April 1, 1997 saw a huge change in Ontario's provincial highway network: over 4000 km of highways were turned back to county, city, and local authorities. Highway 40 was largely spared, although south of Highway 401, the road was turned back, shortening the road by the 17 km it gained in the 1970s. January 1, 1998 saw further changes to Highway 40. It was rerouted through Chatham, Ontario along the route of Former Highway 2 (along Grand Avenue), instead of its old route through downtown via Third Street, Wellington Street, Lacroix Street, and Park Avenue.

It is notable for the numerous K-pop stars that make appearances in the film. The film's English title is sometimes given as Emergency Measure 19 or Emergency 19.  Plot  Troubled by the growing worldwide trend of pop singers being elected as politicians, the President of South Korea orders his Chief Secretary to invoke \\"Emergency Act 19\\". This new law criminalizes all pop singers, and the army is deployed on the streets of Seoul to round them up. One pop star, Hong Kyung- min, is arrested while performing a concert, but his angry fans mob the soldiers as they try to take him away. The Chief Secretary's teenage daughter, Min-ji, is amongst the fans, and leading her idol to safety gives him her phone number. Kyung-min finally makes a getaway with his friend and fellow pop star, Kim Jang-hoon. Once Jang-hoon and Kyung-min become fully aware of the situation, they contact Min-ji who is able to hide the two singers in a secret location. The Chief Secretary finds out that his daughter is working against him, and when she refuses to give them up he has false news reports created, accusing the singers of sexually assaulting minors. Meanwhile, more pop stars are rounded up by the authorities who are now aided by another singer, Ju Yeong-hun, who decides to betray his friends in order to save himself. Angered by their tarnished reputations, Jang-hoon and Kyung-min acquire a gun from a shady weapons dealer, and with Min-ji's help they are able to take the Chief Secretary and his staff hostage. They take their captives to the park, where Min-ji has organized a mass demonstration with her friends and other music fans. The army arrive on the scene and engage the demonstrators in conflict, finally capturing Jang-hoon and Kyung-min. The Chief Secretary is able to walk free in all the chaos, but he is appalled by the violence and orders the fighting to stop, convincing the President to repeal the emergency act and restoring peace.

He was the grandson of Samuel Guggisberg, a cabinetmaker and farmer who had emigrated from Uetendorf in Canton Bern, Switzerland in 1832. He was the eldest son born to merchant Frederick Guggisberg and his wife Dora Louisa Willson. After moving to England in 1879, Guggisberg was educated at Burney's School, Portsmouth and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

In 1908 he returned to Chatham for regimental work, but in 1910 was appointed director of survey in Southern Nigeria. Nigeria gave him full scope for his energies and organizational skills, and he compiled The Handbook of the Southern Nigeria Survey (1911) for the guidance of his assistants. Of this work the director- general of the ordnance survey wrote: :\\"The duties of all members of the staff were strictly defined and, in particular, sensible rules were laid down as to the relations of the staff with the civil administration. Much attention was paid to the treatment of villagers; unpaid labour was forbidden; all goods bought were to be paid for at the recognized rate, and great care was to be exercised not to damage the crops.... They were model instructions and the survey of Nigeria was a model survey.\\" Following the union of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1913, Guggisberg was appointed surveyor-general of Nigeria. In 1914 he was appointed director of public works in the Gold Coast, but he rejoined the army upon the outbreak of the First World War. He commanded the 94th Field Company, Royal Engineers, from 1915 to 1916, and was Commander, Royal Engineers, (CRE) of the 8th Divisional Engineers during the Battle of the Somme (July 1916),Maj A.F.

He was mentioned in dispatches five times, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1918. In 1919, Guggisberg was appointed Governor of the Gold Coast. There he energetically undertook works of development and extension of railways, and created the deep-water harbour of Takoradi, superseding the use of surf-boats for handling traffic. In 1923 he commissioned the construction of Accra's Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, the finest and most modern institution of its kind in colonial Africa at the time. During his time in the Gold Coast, as during his time in Nigeria, Guggisberg was lucky to be able to benefit from the advice of the geologist Albert Ernest Kitson, who took a keen interest in developing local infrastructures. Close association with native Africans during his survey work convinced Guggisberg that the African races and Muslims of the Middle East and Asia were capable of eventually attaining the development levels of modern Europe. Toward the close of his life he wrote: \\"My practical experience... during the last twenty-seven years has convinced me that what individuals have achieved, in spite of ill- selected systems of education, can be achieved by the race generally, provided we alter our educational methods.\\"F. G. Guggisberg and A. G. Fraser, 'The Future of the Negro', 1929 In order to carry out that purpose he founded Achimota College for the training of native teachers and instructors. It was later to become the largest establishment for the education of native Africans. The aim of Guggisberg's policy was the development of the country by and for the natives rather than for the benefit of European capitalists. In 1928 Guggisberg was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of British Guiana, but owing to failing health he was obliged to leave the colony in 1929, and soon afterwards resigned the appointment. He introduced drastic administrative reforms and devoted himself energetically to the problems of maintaining and improving the system of drainage and irrigation upon which the sugar and rice cultivation of the colony depended. He also promoted immigration and peasant settlement and the development of the production and marketing of rice. These activities were cut short by his illness and resignation in 1929. He died at Bexhill-on-Sea at the age of 60. During his last illness Guggisberg addressed to his personal friends a remarkable letter setting forth the aims which he had had in view in his administrative work in British Guiana, his confidence in divine guidance and in the spirit of Christianity, and his hope of being able to return to Africa \\"to try to do some more work for the African races.... As you know\\", he concluded, \\"my heart is in Africa, and I believe that away from the trammels of the Colonial Office, there is opportunity for me to do something useful both for the Empire and for the natives of Africa.\\",Ronald E. Wraith, 'Guggisberg', West African History Series, Oxford University Press, 1967, 342 pp., 8 plates Honours and family Guggisberg was a tall and athletic figure, as a young man very handsome, and always of impressive and dignified presence. His personality was attractive and inspiring. He was for some years captain of the Royal Engineers' cricket eleven and played a first-class cricket match for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1905. He was also a fine player of polo, racquets, golf, and football. He was created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1908 and a Knight Commander in the same Order in 1922. He was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1917. Guggisberg married twice: *On 20 September 1895 in Trichinopoly, Madras Presidency, India, he married Ethel Emily Hamilton Way, daughter of Colonel Wilfred FitzAlan Way of the Northumberland Fusiliers, whom he divorced in 1904 and by whom he had three daughters. *On 15 August 1905 in Staines to (Lilian) Decima Moore, the actress, daughter of Edward Henry Moore, of Brighton, county analyst. She accompanied him on his survey journeys, and their joint book, We Two in West Africa (1909), is an interesting study of a transitional phase in West African development. Guggisberg died in 1930 in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. In 1973 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the construction of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, the Ghanaian government honoured Guggisberg with the erection of a large statue, a rare tribute paid by a post-colonial government to one of its colonial governors. Governor Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg statue at Korle Bu Hospital, Accra, inaugurated in 1974 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the hospital There are male dormitories named after Guggisberg at the Eastern compound of Achimota School in Accra Ghana, Bagabaga College of Education in Tamale Ghana and Prempeh College in Kumasi Ghana. Ethnic background and religious affiliation Despite of the occasional rumours about Guggisberg's background and religious faith being Jewish, it has been thoroughly documented that he was not. His family has long recorded ancestry in the farming village of Belp, going back to the early 16th century and before that in the neighboring hamlet of Niederh√§usern, near the village of Zimmerwald, both in Canton Bern, Switzerland going back even further, to the late 14th century and beyond. The family were adherents to the Evangelical Reformed National Church of Canton Bern (Evangelisch-Reformierte Landeskirche des Kantons Bern) since 1528, when Bern introduced the Protestant Reformation to all its territories, a faith Guggisberg's emigrant grandfather continued to follow throughout his lifetime while in Canada. Guggisberg himself, because of his mother, was baptized and raised in the Anglican denomination, a faith that he piously adhered to until his death.R. E.

History  Fred Usinger, an apprentice sausage maker from Wehen in Germany, emigrated to Milwaukee in the late 1870s. Usinger found work at a small butcher shop on Third Street owned by a Mrs. Julia Gaertner. After approximately a year, Usinger purchased Gartner's business and married her niece, Louise. The couple grew the business and, eventually, their sausage was being shipped nationally. Fred Usinger died in 1930, and company leadership passed to his son, Fred Jr. Then, in 1953, leadership passed to Fredrick Usinger III. During this time, the company's plant on Third Street was expanded. Fredrick adopted a brand image which involved elves, a feature which remains today. A distribution center in the Walker's Point neighborhood was opened in 1994. During the 1990s, operational control passed to the fourth generation siblings, Fritz and Debra Usinger. The company was chosen as an official supplier to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Some production moved to a new facility adjacent to the Walker Point distribution center. Debra Usinger died in July 2012.  Products  Usinger's produces many kinds of sausages and meats, in many cases using traditional 19th-century recipes. Examples include varieties of bratwurst, salami, kishka, chorizo, liverwurst, beerwurst, bologna, pastroma, frankfurters, summer sausage, blood sausage (Blutwurst), ham and head cheese.

The calibre has a significant following among European sportsmen, and most European mass production riflemakers chamber several models of rifle for this cartridge. During the 1970-1990 period this cartridge was widely and successfully used in the Republic of Ireland for deer shooting, since security considerations at a period of Provisional Irish Republican Army violence had led to a ban on the civilian ownership of calibres larger than .224in. Some British small deer specialist hunters use the 5.6√ó57 mm with great success on roe deer, muntjac and Chinese water deer. With a factory-load velocity of with a 74-grain, cone- pointed bullet, it is approximately faster than the .220 Swift cartridge firing a bullet of equivalent weight. The larger case capacity means that handloaders can produce 50-grain loads that, with velocities in excess of , will outpace anything that can safely be achieved by the Swift. The .223 Winchester Super Short Magnum is a 21st-century cartridge that is comparable to the 5.6√ó57 mm. The 5.6√ó57mm cartridge case has a distinctively thick case wall, and this causes significant problems when handloading, owing to the force that needs to be used through the press when re-sizing the case neck. It has been suggested that this unusual neck thickness is the result of the use of .22 rimfire chamber adapters in centrefire rifles chambered for this cartridge. 5.6√ó57mm rimmed variant The 5.6√ó57mmR (designated as the 5,6 √ó 57 R by the C.I.P.) is a rimmed variant of the 5.6√ó57mm.

To these , Burbank added in 1904 and in 1906 until, in 1923, failing health compelled him to sell-off of his holdings. Burbank died in 1926. In 1974, Burbank's widow, Elizabeth Waters Burbank (1888-1977), donated the remaining to the Sebastopol Area Housing Corporation for the purpose of erecting low-income, senior, and disabled housing units with the stipulation that the parcel containing the \\"Caretaker's Cottage\\" (that had been constructed a year or two after an older cottage on the property was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake), the barn, the potting shed (destroyed by fire in the late 1960s) and over 250 living specimens of Burbank's work be set aside and left undisturbed as a historical and horticultural area, dedicated to Burbank, to be studied and enjoyed by future generations. Presently owned by the City of Sebastopol, it is administrated by the Western Sonoma County Historical Society and maintained entirely by volunteers. History of Gold Ridge Farm Faced with the need for more room in which to conduct his experiments in perennial plants, trees and shrubs than could be accommodated by his nursery at his home and gardens in Santa Rosa, Burbank purchased Gold Ridge Farm chiefly because of its subtle variations in environments, exposures and elevations. This allowed him to conduct experiments on plants that varied greatly in characteristics. In its heyday, some estimates put the number of Burbank's on-going plant experiments at Gold Ridge Farm at over 60,000 and tended by a crew of as many as 15 to 20 workers. After Burbank's death in 1926, the remaining extant Burbank plants were cataloged by representatives from Stark Brothers Nursery in Missouri (an influential former client of Burbank's) after which the farm fell into disuse and disrepair until the mid-1970s. The Western Sonoma County Historical Society was formed in Sebastopol at that time from the ranks of local volunteers with the original mission of assuring the preservation and maintenance of Burbank's Gold Ridge Farm. This mission has expanded to presently include the West Sonoma County Museum (headquartered at the old train depot building in downtown Sebastopol), the Sebastopol Archives and the Triggs Reference Room and genealogical archives. Today, Luther Burbank's Gold Ridge Experiment Farm is both a horticultural and historical museum where the public can, by docent or self- guided tour, view literally hundreds of the \\"living legacies\\" of the man once called \\"The Plant Wizard\\". Location Gold Ridge Farm is located at 7777 Bodega Ave. (about west of Main Street) in Sebastopol and is open to the public. This address does not receive mail. Visitors are welcome to park in the parking strip between Bodega Ave. and the senior housing, and walk through the gate that is just to the west of the parking area.

Route description MD 140 is a part of the main National Highway System from I-795 in Reisterstown to US 15 in Emmitsburg. The highway has two segments where it serves as an intermodal connector: from Patterson Avenue in Baltimore to I-695 in Pikesville and from Painters Mill Road to Owings Mill Boulevard in Owings Mills. The remaining portions of MD 140 between its southern terminus in Baltimore and I-795 are classified as National Highway System principal arterials. Baltimore to Reisterstown View north along MD 140 in Pikesville MD 140 begins as a one-way pair of streets at North Avenue northwest of downtown Baltimore. Northbound MD 140 follows Fulton Avenue, which is a two-way street on both sides of North Avenue, and the southbound route follows one-way Monroe Street. US 40 Truck follows North Avenue through the pair of intersections, northbound US 1 enters from the south on Fulton Avenue and turns east onto North Avenue, and southbound US 1 enters from the east on North Avenue and turns south onto Monroe Street. Northbound MD 140 follows four-lane divided Fulton Avenue north for three blocks between the Penn North neighborhood to the east and Mondawmin on the west. The route reaches a four-way intersection with Pennsylvania Avenue and Reisterstown Road, which head southeast and northwest, respectively. Fulton Avenue veers northeast while MD 140 turns northwest onto Reisterstown Road. The highway passes along the southwest side of the Parkview/Woodbrook neighborhood and intersects Gwynns Falls Parkway just before Monroe Avenue splits off as a one-lane ramp from southbound Reisterstown Road. Monroe Avenue immediately expands to two lanes and intersects the parkway, heads southeast, then veers south toward southbound MD 140's terminus at North Avenue. One block north of the convergence of the one-way pair, the state highway intersects Liberty Heights Avenue, which heads west as MD 26, on the east side of Mondawmin Mall. Adjacent to the MD 140-MD 26 intersection is the Mondawmin station of MTA Maryland's Baltimore Metro SubwayLink. MD 140 continues northwest as a six-lane boulevard along the northeast edge of the Liberty Square neighborhood. The highway has an oblique intersection with MD 129 (Auchentoroly Terrace)--there is no direct access from northbound MD 140 to southbound MD 129 or from northbound MD 129 to southbound MD 140--after which the two state highways run concurrently along the west side of Druid Hill Park. MD 140 and MD 129 diverge at a five-way intersection with Druid Park Drive that does not allow direct access from southbound MD 140 to northbound MD 129. MD 140 continues northwest as a four-lane undivided highway paralleled by MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue) one block to the east through the Park Circle neighborhood. MD 140 passes the Louisa May Alcott School and enters Central Park Heights, where the state highway intersects Cold Spring Lane before veering west along the northern edge of the Towanda-Grantley and Lucille Park neighborhoods and the southern edge of Langston Hughes neighborhood. At Belvedere Avenue, MD 140 veers northwest and enters a commercial area within the Woodmere neighborhood. The highway intersects Northern Parkway and passes between the neighborhoods of Glen to the northeast and Reisterstown Station on the southwest. Within the latter neighborhood is the Reisterstown Road Plaza shopping center and its attendant Metro SubwayLink station. MD 140 passes along the edge of the Falstaff neighborhood before leaving the city of Baltimore south of Seven Mile Lane. MD 140 continues northwest through Pikesville as a four-lane undivided highway that passes the Pikesville Armory, Suburban Club Golf Course, the Maryland State Police headquarters, and Druid Ridge Cemetery and intersects Old Court Road. North of that county highway, the state highway gains a center turn lane and meets I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a single-point urban interchange. MD 140 meets the western end of MD 130 (Greenspring Valley Road) and passes the campus of Garrison Forest School in Garrison. Within Owings Mills, the state highway intersects a two-way ramp with Owings Mills Boulevard, passes under the boulevard and CSX's Hanover Subdivision, and passes by the Owings Upper Mill complex. Shortly after entering Reisterstown, MD 140 intersects Franklin Boulevard and Cherry Hill Road and passes by Franklin High School and historic St. Michael's Church. The highway veers north, its name changes to Main Street, and it reduces to two lanes, with occasional center turn lanes, as it enters the Reisterstown Historic District. At the north end of the downtown area, the roadway continues north as MD 30 (Hanover Pike) and MD 140 turns northwest onto two- lane undivided Westminster Pike, now signed as an east-west highway. Reisterstown to Emmitsburg MD 140 westbound concurrent with MD 97 northbound in Westminster On the western edge of Reisterstown, MD 140 (now an east-west highway) has an intersection with the northern end of I-795 (Northwest Expressway) and MD 795, an unnamed and unsigned connector between this intersection and the intersection of MD 30 and MD 128 on the northern edge of Reisterstown. The state highway splits into a pair of flyover ramps that connect with ramps to and from I-795 west of the MD 795 intersection. The eastbound ramp is two-way west to Mitchell Drive, which provides access to the Reisterstown Sportsplex. The ramps merge and MD 140 continues northwest as a four-lane divided highway with a narrow median. West of Woodfield Court and Brian Daniel Court, which westbound MD 140 accesses via a ramp to Gores Mill Road, the median changes to a center left-turn lane. The highway descends into the valley of the North Branch of the Patapsco River and crosses the river and the Baltimore-Carroll county line at the northern end of the river's impoundment, Liberty Reservoir. MD 140 continues northwest as Baltimore Boulevard, now again a four-lane divided highway. The first of several segments of the highway's old alignment, Old Westminster Pike, splits to the southwest as the highway approaches Finksburg, where the highway intersects MD 879, which heads north as Cedarhurst Road and south as Old Gamber Road, and MD 91, which heads north as Emory Road and south as Gamber Road. Access from eastbound MD 140 to northbound MD 91 is via a jughandle in the southwest quadrant of the intersection. Old Westminster Pike first closely parallels the westbound side of MD 140 and then splits west from the eastbound direction and parallels the state highway at a distance. MD 140 expands to six lanes and passes through a commercial area as it enters the city of Westminster. The highway intersects Malcolm Drive, which heads south as MD 97, and continues northwest concurrent with that state highway. The two highways pass the TownMall of Westminster just east of their partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 27 (Manchester Road), just west of which they cross over the Maryland Midland Railway. MD 140 and MD 97 become College View Boulevard at Sullivan Road; the highways diverge at a partial cloverleaf interchange where MD 97 heads north as Littlestown Pike and Pennsylvania Avenue heads south into the Westminster Historic District. MD 140 continues west as four-lane College View Boulevard, which becomes undivided three-lane (one lane westbound, two lanes eastbound) Taneytown Pike at its intersection with the northern end of MD 31 (New Windsor Road), which provides access to McDaniel College. There is no access from eastbound MD 31 to westbound MD 140; that movement is provided by WMC Drive to the west. MD 140 eastbound in northwestern Carroll County MD 140 heads northwest as a partially controlled access two-lane road. At Meadow Brook Farm and Roop's Mill on the western edge of the city of Westminster, the highway crosses Meadow Branch of Big Pipe Creek and has an intersection with Hughes Shop Road and the eastern end of MD 832 (Old Taneytown Road). MD 140 parallels MD 832 to the north as the main highway bypasses Frizzelburg and crosses Richardson Road, Bear Branch, and the mainstem of Big Pipe Creek. The two state highways reunite at a roundabout on the eastern edge of the city of Taneytown. Antrim Boulevard forms the southwest leg of the roundabout and MD 140 continues northwest along Baltimore Street into the Taneytown Historic District. The state highway passes to the north of the historic home Antrim and has a grade crossing of the north-south line of the Maryland Midland Railway before intersecting MD 194, which heads north as York Street and south as Frederick Street. MD 140 becomes Taneytown Pike again on leaving Taneytown and crosses Piney Creek. MD 140 crosses the Monocacy River to enter Frederick County. The highway crosses Cattail Branch and Middle Creek and enters the town of Emmitsburg just east of the highway's extended interchange with US 15 (Catoctin Mountain Highway). East of the U.S. Highway, MD 140 has a four-way intersection with Harney Road and Emmit Gardens Drive, which is unsigned MD 904H (Emmit Gardens Drive) and leads to a right-in/right-out interchange with northbound US 15. MD 140 becomes Main Street and crosses over the U.S. Highway, then has a four-way intersection with Silo Hill Road and unsigned MD 904F, another section of Emmit Gardens Drive that leads to the right-in/right- out ramps with southbound US 15. MD 140 crosses Flat Run and enters the Emmitsburg Historic District. In the center of town, the highway intersects US 15 Business (Seton Avenue). MD 140 leaves the town and gains the name Waynesboro Pike for the short distance northwest to the Pennsylvania state line. Waynesboro Pike continues northwest as PA 16 across South Mountain toward Waynesboro. History left Until 1979, MD Route 140 was U.S. Route 140. Before U.S. Route 140 was deleted, it was where MD 140 is today. At the divergence of MD 140 and MD 97 northwest of Westminster, the two routes were swapped after the deletion of the U.S. route; MD 97 now follows US 140's old route to Pennsylvania, while MD 140 follows MD 97's original route to Taneytown and US 15. As a result, MD 140 follows the bypass of the original MD 32 between Westminster and Taneytown that was first designated as part of MD 97. In 1977, plans were made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with the route to be replaced by MD 140 between Baltimore and Westminster, MD 97 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania state line, and PA 97 between the Maryland state line and Gettysburg. This proposal was made in order to eliminate short routes from the U.S. Highway System. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. At one point, the section between MD 30 in Reisterstown and Westminster was to become a part of MD 9, which would continue northwest to Emmitsburg; MD 140 was to be designated between Baltimore and Reisterstown. US 140 was decommissioned on January 1, 1979 and became MD 140 between Baltimore and Westminster; MD 140 also ran along the former alignment of MD 97 between Westminster and Emmitsburg; MD 97 replaced US 140 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border. Junction list MD 140 is signed north-south from US 1 in Baltimore to MD 30 in Reisterstown and east-west from MD 30 to the Pennsylvania state line.

B. McLaughlin, and others. 1959. 243 p., 24 pls., geol. map.). Ralph Stover State Park is two miles (3.2 km) north of Point Pleasant near Pennsylvania Route 32. History Tohickon Creek was named by the Lenape some of the first inhabitants of the area. \\"To-Hick-Hanne\\" means \\"Deer-Bone-Creek\\". Ralph Stover State Park was the site of an 18th-century gristmill that was built on Tohickon Creek by the park's namesake, Ralph Stover. Remnants of the mill and mill race can still be seen near Tohickon Creek. The Stover family gave their land to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1931. The recreational facilities were built during the Great Depression by the Federal Works Progress Administration created by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide work for the unemployed. Author James A. Michener donated the High Rocks area to the park in 1956. Although \\"High Rocks State Park\\" is listed in the United States Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System and the coordinates given in USGS GNIS are located here, it was never an official name according to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources or a separate park. Recreation High Rocks is a sheer rock face, composed of smooth red Lockatong Formation argillite interspersed with friable Brunswick Formation shale. Since slippery and crumbly rock makes climbing somewhat difficult here, High Rocks is notable mostly to local climbers. Over sixty routes have been put up here over seventeen walls, with difficulties up to 5.12c/d and V7. Most are used for trad climbing and top roping, with some bouldering and sport routes present as well. Tohickon Creek offers whitewater conditions for kayaking in the spring with the winter snow melt and several times a year when water is released from Lake Nockamixon. The creek is also a warm water fishery with smallmouth bass, sunfish, carp and catfish. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission also stocks the creek with trout. A hiking trail of passes the millrace. There is a shaded picnic area along Tohickon Creek and a scenic vista at the top of High Rocks.

Headquartered in Alhambra, California, with branch offices in Cerritos, California, Diamond Bar, California, Industry, California, and West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, this privately held community bank was first established on September 29, 2000. The bank was established to serve the local Chinese community, but unlike those traditional overseas Chinese banks in the United States established earlier, a significant portion of the Tomato Bank clientele are wealthy Chinese immigrants either engaged in international trade and real estate business, or professionals. One unique feature of the bank is that unlike other banks, the founder of this bank is a physician instead of a businessperson. However, Dr. Stephen Liu does have managerial training in that he has earned a master's degree in healthcare management from University of California, Los Angeles after gaining his doctor of medicine (M.D.) degree from the medical school of University of Southern California. Dr. Liu's experience in banking included being a member of the board of American International Bank. The bank originally adopted several names, including InterBusiness Bank, Inter Business Bank, Tomato Bank, and Acer Bank. However, customer surveys revealed that the name Tomato Bank was most popular, partially because it was easy to remember. As explained by the former Chairman and CEO, Dr. Stephen Liu, at a business reception in mid-2006: \\"It is an attractive brand name that brings to mind images of growth, multi- culture and health, all characteristics that represent who we are and what we strive to achieve. But most importantly, it is a brand that is recognizable and hard to forget. If there can be an Apple Computer - why not a Tomatobank? Try to forget it. You can't!\\" The name proved to be unique because other Chinese businesses rarely adopt such unusual names, so that other Chinese merchants would not have to worry about confusing the bank with other businesses. The bank was acquired by Royal Business Bank in February 2016. It is not related to the Japanese Tomato Bank.

It opened on 30 July 1993. Based on the Indiana Jones films, guests are taken on an adventure riding in a mining train through a lost temple. The attraction was sponsored by Esso. History Years before Indiana Jones et le Temple du P√©ril opened in 1993, an Indiana Jones themed attraction had been on the drawing boards, but due to Euro Disney Resort's ongoing financial difficulties, the attraction was retooled. Originally, guests would have been able to experience a full-scale Indiana Jones land-within-a-land, featuring a huge mine cart roller coaster based on the famous sequence from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The ride would have taken guests through wild jungles, around the lost temple and inside a large showbuilding for the mine chase scenes. Rumours often circulate of other attractions to have been included in the area, such as Disneyland's EMV (enhanced motion vehicle) Indiana Jones Adventure and a new Jungle Exploration attraction based on the classic Jungle Cruise. Indiana Jones et le Temple du P√©ril is the first ever Disney roller coaster to feature an inversion and the first ever Disney thrill ride to have a track gauge wider than 50 inches at 55 inches. Ultimately, the constrained budgets and requirement for a high-thrill attraction (at this point, Space Mountain was still 2‚Äì3 years away) brought the birth of Indiana Jones et le Temple du P√©ril, a looping coaster produced by Intamin of Switzerland. Giovanola is subcontractor. Despite lacking an indoor show building and the same scale as its \\"blue sky\\" predecessor, the final attraction stays true to the heavy theming of the original plans, with enough landscaping, winding paths and lush vegetation. In summer 1993 (a few weeks after the opening) the emergency brakes locked on during a ride. Some people were hurt and the attraction was temporarily shut down for investigations. Originally there were torches illuminating the stairway at night but they were removed in 2000. The Temple du P√©ril was the first roller coaster in a Disney theme park with an inversion. It also has the highest height requirement of any Disney theme park attraction in the world, though it is no longer the most intense. Backwards Seeking a new attraction to market for their 2000 season and wanting to bring more interest back to the attraction, the Imagineers of Disneyland Paris embarked on an ambitious project to create Indiana Jones et le Temple du P√©ril: Backwards!. In addition to removing the bodies of each train from their chassis and reversing them, the team added an extra two seats to each car, bringing the total for each two-car train from 8 to 12. Lighting and props had to be reversed throughout the ride to ensure guests did not see any signs of \\"backstage\\", and the track of the roller coaster itself even had to be altered and reprofiled at some points. Since guests travelling backwards are unaware of upcoming curves and drops, their bodies are unable to prepare for the movement. This meant some of the sharper drops and curves had to be \\"softened\\" to make the attraction a smoother experience. The reconfigured attraction reopened on 1 April 2000. On 27 November 2004, the attraction was \\"reversed\\" once more to return the trains to their original forward direction. 2014 refurbishment The ride was closed on 7 January 2014 for a major refurbishment, which includes partially demolishing and rebuilding the structure and track with more durable materials to keep the ride safe and secure. Rumours also suggested that the rebuilt attraction might have been slightly different from the original 1993 plans to make way for future rides at the resort. The ride reopened on May 28, 2014, and in the end remained identical to the original plans but with a slightly larger loop and structures designed with real stone. The experience The loading station The attraction is designed around the theme of an expedition to the lost Temple of Peril. The queue wanders through an abandoned base camp, meandering toward the temple where guests climb a staircase to the temple entrance. Inside the temple, guests board a mine car. According to Disney Imagineer Tony Baxter, \\"Temple du P√©ril is a traditional roller coaster attraction; the roller coaster cars, which are supposed to be mine cars, are going up and down over the surface of the temple, clearing debris or putting back the artifacts and so forth. It's a very simple little premise. Then the car seems to go out of control and upside down during its trip around the various temple pieces.\\" Ride layout The track layout of the attraction is based on the layout of the first looping roller coaster built by the Pinfari company. Pinfari called this a TL-59, the TL stands for \\"The Loop\\" and the 59 is for the ride's 59m width. This Intamin version copies the course but uses a track style which is unique to Intamin. The style and basic design of this attraction was used as the inspiration and basis for the Tokyo DisneySea coaster Raging Spirits.

Reverend H. R. Caldwell used his .22 Savage Hi-Power on 400 pound tigers in China with success, something the Savage rifle company exploited in its advertising for the cartridge in the early days. The famous elephant hunter WDM Bell used a .22 Savage Hi-Power to kill Cape buffalo in West Africa in the 1920s, and reported in his magazine articles that the cartridge was popular at that time for red deer stalking in Scotland. While it was used in the UK on deer as large as Red Stags, it fell out of favour as a big game cartridge due to its small caliber and light bullets. As time went on, other .22 centerfire cartridges outstripped it in performance such as the .220 Swift, and with the advent of the .223 Remington in the 1960s, the cartridge was considered obsolete.https://www.ballisticstudies.com/Knowledgebase/.22+Savage+Hi+Power.html Today it is regarded as a vintage round, and aficionados use it for small game hunting in similar applications as the .223 Remington, though it is used for deer hunting where it is legal to do so. In Europe the cartridge is still chambered in drillings and similar combination guns, and the cartridge is still used by hunters for smaller European deer species such as Roe deer.

Robinson.Variety film review; December 4. 1963. page 8. It was directed by Mark Robson, produced by Pandro S. Berman and adapted for the screen by Ernest Lehman from the novel of the same name by Irving Wallace. It also features an early score by prolific composer Jerry Goldsmith.Clemmensen, Christian. Jerry Goldsmith (1929-2004) tribute at Filmtracks.com. Retrieved 2011-04-14. Plot The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to Andrew Craig (Paul Newman), who is disrespectful of it, and seems more interested in women and drinking. Arriving in Stockholm for the award ceremony, he is delighted that the beautiful Inger Lisa Andersson (Elke Sommer) has been assigned as his personal chaperone. At the hotel where all the winners are guests, Andrew is introduced to the physics laureate, Dr. Max Stratman (Edward G. Robinson), an elderly German-born American, who is accompanied by his niece Emily (Diane Baker). The Nobel laureates for medicine are Dr. John Garrett (Kevin McCarthy) and Dr. Carlo Farelli (Sergio Fantoni). Garrett thinks Farelli must have stolen his work rather than reaching the same result through improvisation, and thus does not deserve half the prize. The chemistry winners are a married couple, Drs. Denise and Claude Marceau (Micheline Presle and G√©rard Oury). Claude Marceau's mistress, Monique Souvir (Jacqueline Beer), is traveling with them and Denise feels neglected as a woman; later she asks Andrew to help by pretending to an affair. That night, Max accepts an invitation to meet an old friend, Hans Eckhart (John Wengraf), in a park. Eckhart asks him to publicly repudiate the U.S. and the prize, and defect to Communist East Germany. When Max refuses, he is kidnapped and an impostor takes his place. Emily is not fooled for a moment, but since he is Walter, the father she thought was dead, she plays along. The next day, Andrew is surprised when \\"Max\\" does not remember meeting him, and his manner also seems different. But there is no time to talk: Andrew has an interview scheduled. Depressed and angry at himself, he tells the press the truth: far from still being a great literary talent, he has not even been able to start writing the much-anticipated novel he has been \\"working on\\" for years. He has been drinking heavily and supporting himself by writing pulp detective stories, and is accepting the prize only because of the money. Asked for an example of developing a detective story, he suggests the possibility that Max may be an impostor. Andrew is telephoned by an Oscar Lindblom, who offers information about Max. He goes to Lindblom's apartment and finds the man dying. He sees and chases the assassin (Sacha Pito√´ff), whose name is Daranyi, but is thrown into a canal. A cursory police investigation, with Inger and Andrew there, finds no evidence of crime; they assume he imagined it while drunk. But Lindblom's widow says he is a makeup artist: exactly what an impostor would have needed. Emily and Andrew follow a lead to a hospital where Max was being held, but he is whisked away before they find him. Emily leaves Andrew there without a car. On foot, he is attacked again by Daranyi and flees to a nudist lecture where he must remove his clothes. He gets away by disturbing the meeting until the police are called. They again assume he is drunk and return him to his hotel wearing only a towel. He has no key, but Denise Marceau lets him into her room‚Äîwhere she makes sure Claude sees him, producing the desired effect on Claude. Inger has now seen enough to realize Andrew was right and has been acting admirably, and begins falling in love as she joins in his investigation. But the next day, Andrew is told she is being held hostage. Following clues Inger helped with, Andrew sneaks on board a docked German freighter soon to depart for Leningrad. Lindblom's body is there, and Inger is locked in with Max. Andrew manages to break them out, but at the hotel, Max collapses from the strain. Drs. Garrett and Farelli diagnose cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation. Farelli earns Garrett's admiration by improvising a crude defibrillator. Max is revived and dressed just in time to receive his prize. When the impostor leaves the auditorium, Daranyi kills him; dying, he admits he is not Walter either, but an actor. Andrew chases Daranyi to the roof; Daranyi again attempts to kill Andrew but is shot by police and falls to his death. Andrew returns just in time to accept his own prize‚Äîand Inger's love.

They comprise a decorated pyramidal outer frame with candle holders and a central carousel with a rotor at the top which is driven by warm air from the lit candles. The carousel is decorated with nativity scenes and other Christmas figures such as angels and wise men, as well as worldly motifs such as mining folk and forest scenes.  Description  It is suggested that the Christmas pyramid is a predecessor of the Christmas tree. These pyramids are not limited to Christmas: in the Erzgebirge there was a custom of dancing around the \\"St. John's Tree\\", \\"a pyramid decked with garlands and flowers\\", at the summer solstice. Not actually pyramid-shaped, the Christmas pyramid is a kind of carousel with several levels, some depicting Christian motifs such as angels or manger scenes, and others with more secular motifs such as mountain-folk, forests, and other scenes from the everyday life of people in the Erzgebirge. The spinning motion of the pyramids is traditionally achieved with the help of candles whose rising heat spins a propeller above. Generally Christmas pyramids are made of wood and based on four- to eight-sided platforms with a long pole in the middle serving as the axle to which the entire apparatus tapers above and which supports any further platforms. Inside in a glass or ceramic support is a driveshaft on to which at least one platform is attached. The figures, which stand on the platforms are also traditionally made of wood. Christmas pyramids take various forms from intricately carved miniature houses with pitched roofs, to large multi-level structures that simply serve as a display for the carved figures. In many cities in the Ore Mountains there are large Christmas pyramids on the Market Square at the Christmas Market or in other locations associated with Christmas hustle and bustle. Most of the pyramids demonstrate nativity scenes.German Christmas Pyramids Retrieved 10 April 2013 They include the story of the Christ child being born, of shepherds and wise men visiting the child, and of angels rejoicing in heavenChristmas The Slow Way Retrieved 10 April 2013 The nativity scene often is placed on the longest shelf at the bottom of the pyramid, while a pine cone or a star would crown the top.  History of the Christmas pyramid  An example at the Christmas Market in D√ºsseldorf Christmas pyramids were originally hung from the ceiling of German families' houses. The custom spread across Europe, mainly to Italy and England and was brought to America by German immigrants in the 1700s.\\"History of German Christmas Pyramids\\" Retrieved 10 April 2013 The origins of the Christmas pyramids date back to the Middle Ages. In this period it was traditional in southern and western Europe to bring evergreen branches, for example boxwood, into the home and hang them in order to ward off moroseness in the dark and cold winter months. In northern and eastern Europe traditional candles were used to achieve this goal. The Christmas pyramid would eventually unify these two traditions and become a symbol of Christmas celebrations. The forerunner of the pyramid was a construction known as a Lichtergestelle (literally: light stand) which were very popular in the 18th century. They were constructions made of four poles, decorated with evergreen boughs, tied together at the top and lit with candles. In the large cities, the Christmas tree, now recognizable all over the world, gradually replaced the Lichtergestelle, but in the mountains, the people did not see a simple tree bedecked with lights; rather they were reminded of the capstans, which were commonly used in the mines of the Ore Mountains. To the pyramid shape was added the spinning motion of the capstan and the earliest Christmas pyramids were born. The name \\"Christmas pyramid\\" came about because the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt at the end of the 18th century brought pictures of the pyramids back to Europe and eventually to the Ore Mountains, where they reminded the people of the mining capstans and also of the Christmas constructions. A pyramid at the Christmas market in Mainz An important breakthrough in the popularity of the Christmas pyramid came around 1830 with the discovery of kerosene. Previously, people had used relatively expensive candles or rapeseed oil. As the means to light and spin the pyramids became much cheaper, the tradition spread. Now such pyramids can be found in numerous styles and sizes all over Germany as well as in many parts of the United States.

The club currently plays in National League 2 South following their relegation from National League 1 at the end of the 2017-18 season. History The club won promotion from National League 2 South in 2011‚Äì12 to National League 1, and in 2012‚Äì13 finished 5th, their highest ever place in the English rugby union system. The club was relegated from National One at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, after an administration error led to a five-point deduction; this meant that the club missed out on staying up by just a single point. However, They were promoted back into the division after winning the playoff in 2015‚Äì16 via the play-off.

The MINIS enjoy good success in the Hertfordshire leagues, whilst the JUNIORS are well represented in the Saracens Herts and Middlesex Junior leagues. Most age groups are able to provide three squads to the leagues and provide very good competition. Junior & Senior Women's rugby OA Saints are the women's section of Old Albanians (OA) Rugby Football Club. The women's section were originally part of St Albans RFC, based in Smallford, which formed in 1989 from only four female players and grew to a squad of over 45 with a place in the top flight National Premiership League One in 1997/98 returning to the Women's Rugby Premiership for 2 seasons in 2010/11 and 2011/12. In 2003, a year after the Old Albanians moved from Beech Bottom and took up residence in the brand new facilities at Woollam's playing fields, the Saints were invited to join OA Rugby. The women's section brought with them and keeps to this day their title ‚ÄòSaints‚Äô as a nostalgic reminder of their roots at St Albans RFC. Since joining OA Rugby, the Saints have established an excellent women's section with a reputation as one of the top women's club in the county, with regional, divisional and international representative honours amongst its ranks. In 2005 the first women's XV ('OA SAINTS'), unbeaten since November 2003, secured the South East One league title without losing a game. They won promotion to National League 2 in the subsequent play-off competition, securing victory over each of their regional rivals. In 2010 the OA Saints 1st XV gained promotion to the RFUW Premiership. They currently compete in the National South East 2 Championship and finished 3rd in the league for the 16/17 and 17/18 season, so are targeting to win the league in the 2018-19 season. In the 2018-2019 season with England and Saracens full back Sarah McKenna now established in the coaching team, the Saints won the Championship SE2 league by 8 points and then gained promotion to Championship 1 South by beating Guildford Gazelles in the playoff. They also completed the double by beating Harrogate RFC in the RFU National Intermediate cup final to record their most successful season In 2017-18 the junior sides have won a multitude of tournaments and their league as well as getting Saracens, County and England Talent Development Group honours (detailed below)  2017-18 Saints Success Summary  Under 13s The U13s don't play in a league but had a very successful season only losing 3 games.

The playing facilities opened in 2002 with a club-selected XV match against a star-studded international XV led by Peter Winterbottom which formed the centre-piece of the opening ceremony. The state-of-the-art sporting complex on the northern outskirts of St Albans was acknowledged as the largest sporting development in Europe during its construction. It is regarded by many as the finest amateur sporting venue in the land. The Woollam Playing Fields is the choice of Saracens for their home training base and has hosted both England Under 16 and England RFUW International matches. Representative honours OAs have had players recognized at county level and national level.

It is a concept album focusing on contemporary issues including capitalism, materialism, and consumerism. Scarsick is the last album to feature Johan Langell on drums. Overview According to Daniel Gildenl√∂w, \\"Scarsick is much more band oriented and down to the core. Threatening and disturbing\\". The liner notes reveal that Scarsick is actually The Perfect Element, part II - \\"he\\". The album is divided into two chapters: side A and side B. Concept Scarsick is the second part of a planned, three-piece concept and the follow-up to The Perfect Element, part I. It continues the story of the male character from the latter album. Unlike its predecessor, Scarsick is a politically charged social commentary, and deals with a number of topics, including: *Frustration (with society in general, and most of the things listed below) *Consumer culture *Materialism *Industrialization *Capitalism *Commercialization *American imperialism *Conformity *Idolization of celebrities *Collectivist nature of religion *Decline of civilization Daniel Gildenlow has revealed in interviews that the life of \\"He\\" is an allegory for all of mankind; that in him we see the problems of society on an intimate, personal level. Thus as The Perfect Element, part I deals with the subject of dysfunction in a psychological context that deals with the individual, Scarsick deals with them in a sociological sense and explores the relationship between the two. Just as the final song on the first part of the concept (\\"The Perfect Element\\") witnesses the falling of \\"He\\" on a mental level, the final song on Scarsick (\\"Enter Rain\\") sees him fall on a physical level.  Track listing  Concept, music and lyrics by Daniel Gildenl√∂w. Scarsicker The band offered an edited version of the album as a download from their official store in 2008. It also featured two new short tracks. Gildenl√∂w said on the release, :I had this idea about making edits where all of the songs would clock in under 5 minutes each. My absolute first idea was to make a radio edit version of the album, where every song would simply be cut at precisely 3:50 or something, except for the track America, in which we instead would add like 10 minutes of commercials after the \\"We'll be back after this short break!\\" phrase. But once I was sitting down with the tracks it became sort of a challenge. Some of the songs I prefer in the original version, but some (like Idiocracy and Mrs Modern Mother Mary for instance) really turned out more like I initially intended them to be, and I prefer them. Also, I could use my original idea for an intro to the album - it was scrapped for the official release since I felt it gave away the TPE1 link way too soon. The Slipsync track uses recurring themes, a trademark POS conceptual instrumental passage, and was originally thought as a Japanese bonus track, but then it felt more right on this edited album version, called SCARSICKER.

MetroBank The first of the two, MetroBank (also known as Metro Bank), headquartered in Houston, Texas, with branch offices in Bellaire, Texas, Sugar Land, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Plano, Texas, Richardson, Texas and other communities throughout the Greater Houston, this bank was the original one for the company.. Like its competitor Southwestern National Bank, the location of in the bank in the south reflects one of the newest trends of Chinese American and Asian American population diffusion into the area other than the traditional regions settled by Asian Americans such as the western United States and northeastern United States. The rapid expansion of this bank in comparison to other overseas Chinese banks in the traditional regions where most Chinese American / immigrant and Asian American / immigrant was due to the booming economy of the late 1990s, in the regions of Telecom Corridor (Silicon Prairie) and Silicon Hills, which attracted a significant number of Chinese / Asian scientists and engineers. As of 2006, the asset of the bank is $976.384 million USD according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Metro United Bank Although the establishment of its original bank marked the new residential trend of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans, a significant majority of them still reside in the traditional regions of the western coast of the United States. The huge market was simply too big to ignore for the company and it thus begun its expansion into California, the state with most Chinese American and Asian American population. On October 5, 2005, the company purchased First United Bank, and its locations in San Diego, California and Los Angeles, renamed it as the Metro United Bank (T: Á¨¨‰∏ÄÈäÄË°å, S: Á¨¨‰∏ÄÈì∂Ë°å, P: D√¨yƒ´ Y√≠nh√°ng), thus completed its expansion by venturing into the traditional region where most Chinese Americans reside.

Biography Stone was born on 13 March 1909 at Eton College, where both his grandfather, E. D. Stone, and father, E. W. Stone, were assistant masters.Kenneth Clark, Reynolds Stone: engravings (London, John Murray, 1977), . He was educated there and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he obtained a degree in history in 1930. He had no clear idea of his future, and, at the suggestion of Francis Scott, a young don at Magdalene, almost drifted into a two-year apprenticeship at the Cambridge University Press, where he came under the influence of Walter Lewis and, more importantly, F. G. Nobbs, the overseer of the composing department. Nobbs, to quote Stone, 'whisked me out of the hand-composing room into his office' where he taught him to appreciate letter design. A chance encounter with Eric Gill on the London to Cambridge train led to Stone spending a fortnight with Gill at Piggotts in Speen, Buckinghamshire engraving an alphabet on wood.J. W. Goodison, Reynolds Stone: his early development as an engraver on wood (Cambridge University Press, 1947). In 1932 he moved to Taunton, where he spent two years working at the printing firm of Barnicott & Pearce, a very different experience from his time in Cambridge. His experience of printing convinced him that this was not what he wanted to do for rest of his life. At Taunton he came across some old wood blocks which Barnicott gave him, and, in a bookshop at Combwich, he started to buy the wood engraved books of the 1850s and 1860s. He had already come across the wood engravings of Thomas Bewick at Cambridge, and, in 1934, 'sacked himself' and became a freelance wood engraver, moving to Codicote near Hitchin. He married the photographer Janet Woods in 1938. They had four children ‚Äì the painter Edward Stone (1940), the designer Humphrey Stone (1942), the illustrator Phillida Gili, and Emma Beck, wife of artist Ian Beck. The family were friends of the poet Cecil Day-Lewis and his family. In 2017 his son, the actor Daniel Day-Lewis named the character of his final film 'Reynolds Woodcock', as a reference to him, and his typeface designs were used for the titles of the film. He was elected a member of the Society of Wood Engravers in 1948. In 1953 he was appointed a CBE and moved to the Old Rectory in Litton Cheney near Dorchester, where he lived until his death. Commercial work Stone's output was considerable. Nearly all of his contemporaries would have seen his work, although few knew his name. A common sight in most high streets was the logo that he designed for Dolcis and which featured on the frontage of all their shoe shops. In 1949 he redesigned the famous clock logo of The Times. He engraved the Royal Arms for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 and the official coat of arms for Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1955, still reproduced today on the cover of the UK passport. He also designed the coat of arms for the British Council. He designed a number of Royal Mail postage stamps, starting with the 1946 Victory stamp. He designed the ¬£5 and ¬£10 bank notes respectively in 1963 and 1964 ‚Äì including the Queen's portrait ‚Äì for the Bank of England. Stone is perhaps best known for his lettering. Stanley Morison, the typographer, valued him above all for this ability and said to him: anyone can draw trees. Stone's lettering was hugely admired and he worked in many media. In 1939 Stone started to teach himself to cut letters in stone. His expertise in lettering led to a number of prestigious commissions for memorials. In 1952 he carved the memorial tablet to employees of the museum who died in World War II in the Grand Entrance of the Victoria and Albert Museum. This memorial complements the Eric Gill memorial to employees who died in World War I. In 1965 he carved the memorial to Winston Churchill and the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Westminster Abbey. In 1966 he carved the memorial for T. S. Eliot in the abbey. One of his latest works, in 1977, was the gravestone of composer Benjamin Britten. In 1954 he designed the Minerva typeface for Linotype, intended to complement Gill's Pilgrim in display sizes. He also designed a proprietary face named after his wife, Janet. In 1956 Stone was elected as a Royal Designer for Industry for his work in Lettering. Wood engravings and book illustrations Stone was a self-taught wood engraver, which makes his achievements more remarkable. He had little difficulty moving from the graver and tools of the wood engraver to the chisel and mallet of the stone carver. Most of the commissions discussed above were wood engravings, as was most of his work. His bookplates are distinguished particularly by the flowing elegance of the lettering. He produced over 350, for example for Hugh Trevor- Roper, depicting his home Chiefswood, and for John Sparrow, a nice example of his skill with letters. He had a very good eye for coats of arms, as shown by commissions from the Royal Family and the British Government as well as private individuals. His work stood out from that of other wood engravers, who illustrated more books than Stone. Many of his commissions were for single engravings, even for books. It was a mark of distinction to have a Stone engraving on the title-page or colophon. He did, however, illustrate a number of books treasured by collectors. In 1935 he produced 42 headpieces for The Shakespeare Anthology for the Nonesuch Press and, in the same year, 12 wood engravings for A Butler's Recipe Book 1719 for the Cambridge University Press. For the Gregynog Press he illustrated The History of Saint Louis (1937) and The Praise and Happinesse of the Countrie-Life (1938), the latter being particularly successful. In the same year he illustrated Old English Wines and Cordials for the High House Press. He illustrated Lucretia Borgia for the Golden Cockerel Press in 1942. One of his most successful editions for a commercial publisher was an anthology compiled by Adrian Bell, The Open Air (1949). Sylvia Townsend Warner wrote poems to complement a series of wood engravings that Stone had already completed. The result was Boxwood (1957), a limited edition of 500 copies, an extended new edition of which was published in 1960. Stone continued with A Sociable Plover by Eric Linklater (1957) and The Skylark and other poems by Ralph Hodgson (1958). For the Limited Editions Club he illustrated Herman Melville's Omoo in 1961. He also illustrated Saint Thomas Aquinas (1969) and The Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1974) for the club. In 1968 the Chilmark Press published an edition of The Mountains, a volume of poetry and prose by R. S. Thomas to complement a series of wood engravings made by Stone after John Piper in 1946. Stone illustrated a number of books and portfolios for Warren Editions. The first was The Other Side of the Alde (1968), the first use of his Janet typeface. This was followed by ABC, an Alphabet (1974), The Old Rectory (1976) and a posthumous new edition of Boxwood (1983). For the Compton Press he illustrated A Shepherd's Life by W. H. Hudson (1977) and A Year of Birds by Iris Murdoch (1978). His last engraving was the only one he managed to complete of a series to illustrate a republication of Sacheverell Sitwell's book Valse Des Fleurs, published in a limited edition of 400 copies in 1980. It appears on the title page of the book, and a tailpiece woodcut is published at the end. An overview of his life and work There was a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Dorset County Museum in 1981,Roger Peers (ed.), Reynolds Stone 1909-1979 (Dorchester, Dorset County Museum, 1981). followed by a major exhibition of his work in the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum between July and October 1982.Roy Strong (ed.), Reynolds Stone 1909-1979 (London, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1982). Another, to honour the centenary of his birth, was held at The Red House, Aldeburgh, in April 2009. His skills were widely recognised and much in demand. Much of his work was for official bodies, so much so that Hans Schmoller wrote of him in his obituary: ... he might almost be described as the 'Engraver Royal'.Hans Schmoller, 'Obituary' in Journal of the Royal Society of Arts (August 1979). His wood engravings showed a clarity of vision and an intensity that his preparatory sketches lacked. His wood engraved illustrations are distinguished by a formality and sureness of cutting, and his bookplates and coats of arms by a clarity and simplicity within the flourishes. Stone said of his work: One bold flourish is usually better than a larger number of small twiddles, which are not worth doing anyway. But the final danger is to do too much because the eye, delighted by a small mouthful, is soon surfeited.Reynolds Stone et al, Concerning Booklabels (London, Private Libraries Association, 1963). Collections There have been two collections of Stone's wood engravings, the first by Myfanwy Piper,Myfanwy Piper, The Wood-Engravings of Reynolds Stone (London, Art & Technics, 1951). the second, more definitive, with an introduction by Kenneth Clark. Michael Harvey has written about his wood engraved lettering.Michael Harvey, Reynolds Stone: Engraved Lettering in Wood (Wakefield, Fleece Press, 1992). The catalogue of the Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition reprints the Goodison text and two pieces by Stone, and gives a comprehensive list of the whole range of Stone's work. David Chambers has produced a checklist of his bookplates, and Jeremy Malin has produced a very full checklist of his published works. There is an official website dedicated to Stone.

The diocese was founded in 1870, and it became an archdiocese in 1988. The seat of the Archdiocese is the Cathedral of Notre Dame in the city of Luxembourg, and since 2011 the Archbishop is Jean-Claude Hollerich.  History   Early Christianity  Christianity spread in Luxembourg from the city of Trier, along the Roman roads. The episcopal organisation of the area started in the late 3rd century with Euchaire and Maximin of Trier, and in the early 4th century, Materne of Cologne. The Christianisation of rural areas only came much later. Rural populations remained strangers to Christianity despite scattered islands in Arlon, Bitburg, Altrier and Dalheim. In the late 5th century, the Church was cut off from the power held by the new, Frankish arrivals, who were dedicated to the cult of Odin. After the baptism of the Frankish king Clovis I, the Frankish people were open to Christianity in theory, but paganism subsisted in remote regions, and only died out over the next two centuries. Under the Carolingians, the Frankish church's reorganisation went underway, and the evangelisation of the area of Luxembourg was facilitated by the official recognition of Christianity. Missionaries from Aquitaine, Ireland and England helped in this.Kreins, p. 11 The work of these missionaries was complemented by the foundation of monasteries in the 7th and 8th centuries: St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier (633), Stavelot-Malmedy (650), Andagium (687). Andagium became the abbey of Saint-Hubert when the remains of Saint Hubert, the bishop of Li√®ge and patron saint of the Ardennes, were moved there in 824. Around 690, Saint Leodouin founded the abbey of Mettlach, while in 722, Bertha, sister of Charles Martel, founded Pr√ºm Abbey, with the aid of monks from Echternach. In the Germanic part of the region, the work of Willibrord was of prime importance. An Anglo-Saxon originally from Northumbria, Willibrord was born around 657, and took vows in the Benedictine abbey of Ripon. Around 690, he travelled with several companions to southern Frisia. He was made a bishop in 695, and established his episcopal see in Utrecht. In 698 he came to Trier. Irmine, the abbess of Oeren near Trier, granted him land in Echternach, and possessions in Badelingen, Batzen, Osweiler, and a vineyard in Vianden. Willibrord undertook new constructions in Echternach, and founded the Abbey of Echternach, dedicated to educating monks according to the Benedictine rule. It was in Echternach that he was buried in 739, and he would later come to be seen as a national saint. The abbey of Echternach saw an extraordinary development, and continued to enjoy protection by rulers after the death of its founder. Its spiritual and artistic influence would make it one of the most important monasteries in the West. It went on to produce manuscripts, illuminated holy texts, which started to be dispersed from the 18th century. The contents of its library was estimated at 7,000 items at the times of the end of the Ancien R√©gime. The French Revolutionaries' pillages, and the flight of the monks towards Germany, taking with them their treasures which they later sold, caused the abbey's works of medieval religious art to be dispersed until today throughout the libraries of Nuremberg, Bremen, Trier, Darmstadt, Hamburg, El Escorial and Paris.  13th century: reign of Ermesinde  In the reign of Countess Ermesinde in the 13th century, several religious establishments were founded in Luxembourg, such as the convent of Marienthal near Mersch, a convent of Penitents on the Saint-Esprit plateau, a Cistercian monastery in Bonnevoie, the Canons Regular of St. Augustine in Houffalize, a hospital of the Trinitarians in Bastogne, and a convent in Clairefontaine-lez- Arlon.Kreins, p. 27  16th and 17th centuries: Spanish Netherlands  The Jesuits were present in Luxembourg from 1594, and due to their work, the territory was hardly affected by the Reformation. They promoted the veneration of the Virgin Mary, as \\"Our Lady of Luxembourg\\" and ‚ÄúComforter of the Afflicted‚Äù (Consolix Afflictorum), in times of plague and war. She was chosen as the patroness of the city (1666) and of the duchy of Luxembourg (1678). This devotion continues to this day in the form of a national pilgrimage, the Octave, celebrated every year for two weeks in the period after Easter. The Provincial Council (Conseil provincial) exercised functions in the ecclesiastical domain. Luxembourg had the peculiarity that the bishops, the ecclesiastical authorities, resided outside of the territory. Their acts could not obtain the force of law without the approval of the Council, in the form of the \\"placet\\". The Council often made use of this to retain control of the Catholic Reformation, and to force foreign bishops to recognise its authority.Kreins, p. 43 At first it was necessary for papal and episcopal acts, but eventually was required for any juridical act by a clergyman. In certain areas, the Council exercised a right of censorship over the church, such as in the areas of visits by the bishops or their representatives, papal and episcopal bulls and pastoral letters, observations of religious holidays, and appointments to parishes. During the conflicts with Trier, the Council's resistance prevented the archbishop of Trier from levying taxes from the Luxembourgish clergy.Kreins, p. 44 From the 14th century, the ruler of Luxembourg had had to consult the nobility, the clergy and the bourgeoisie, especially when asking for money: this eventually evolved into the Provincial Estates of Luxembourg. As to the clergy, contemporary sources mention specifically the sires pr√©lats, as it was only the large abbeys that were represented, as large-scale landowners. These were the abbey of St. Maximin of Trier, which was outside of Luxembourg but owned a lot of land in the territory, as well as the abbeys of Echternach, Munster, Orval, and Saint- Hubert, and the priory of Houffalize. The secular clergy and the smaller monasteries were not represented.Kreins, p. 44-45 Luxembourg was at this time divided between six dioceses, two of which took up the lion's share of the duchy: the archdiocese of Trier and the diocese of Li√®ge; the others were the dioceses of Metz, Verdun, Reims and Cologne.Kreins, p. 45 The secular clergy at this time lived a generally unvirtuous life, lived in poverty and were under-educated. As to the regular clergy, there was a profound decadence which affected the old and established monasteries such as that of Echternach (Benedictines), Saint-Hubert (Benedictines), Orval (Cistercians), Altm√ºnster (Benedictines) as well as more recent establishments. As in the rest of the Habsburg Netherlands, the situation of the Catholic Church in Luxembourg was precarious: the number of clerics who drank or had relationships was high, and the parishioners were often left to themselves, without regular religious instruction, and turned to superstition. The number of witchcraft trials in the 16th and 17th centuries was correspondingly high.Kreins, p. 46  18th century: Austrian Habsburgs  In the 18th century, the clergy in Luxembourg could take no substantive decision without the consent of the state. The practice of the placet allowed the government to exercise a measure of control on ecclesiastical acts. No order or pastoral letter, whether from the pope or the bishop, could be published in the duchy without the consent of the Conseil de Luxembourg. Nominations to a parish or benefice could not go ahead without the assent of the civil authorities.Kreins, p. 55-56 The secular clergy's situation, particularly in rural areas, was not particularly healthy. The more favoured among them were educated in the theology faculties of Louvain, Trier or Cologne; the others received their education from a parish priest, who would have taught them some elements of Latin, philosophy and theology. The priests' social rank would vary greatly according to their financial situation.Kreins, p. 56 The clergy's resources derived from tithes, revenues from fees for baptisms, marriages and burials, and revenues from the bouvrot, land which rural clergymen exploited as farmers of crops or livestock. Many of them exercised the function of \\"cur√©-notaire\\", drafting contracts of marriage and testaments for their parishioners. This function, defined in 1586 by Philip II, was particularly present in the duchy of Luxembourg, which was handicapped by large distances and the poor urban network. Those clergymen without a parish were forced to content themselves with the revenues from working as parochial vicars, sacristans or as schoolteachers. These clergymen, poorly educated and living modestly, were a reflection of the rural, poor and superstitious Luxembourgish society, from which many of them originated. The regular clergy enjoyed a higher level of prestige than the secular clergy. It was concentrated in the abbeys of Echternach, Munster, Saint-Hubert and Orval. The abbeys were large property owners in the 18th century, and built their own foundries; the abbots, alongside their spiritual role, also played a political and industrial role. Nicolas Spirlet (1715-1794), the last abbot of Saint- Hubert, specialised in producing cannons which were exported to Revolutionary America. After the reforms of Joseph II, the contemplative orders were suppressed, while the large monasteries disappeared in the French Revolution. Orval was the only one that would later be re-founded, in 1927. Before the French Revolution, the southern part of the territory of what is now the archdiocese belonged to the Diocese of Trier (then an archbishopric) and the northern part to the Diocese of Li√®ge.  19th century to present  After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, which raised Luxembourg to the rank of Grand Duchy in personal union with the crown of the Netherlands, Pope Pius VII attached the territory to the Diocese of Namur.Histoire de l‚ÄôArchev√™ch√© de Luxembourg From 25 December 1833 Johann Theodor van der Noot, became apostolic prefect of the part of Luxembourg under Dutch control, and he became the first apostolic vicar when, on 2 June 1840, the territory of the Grand Duchy became an apostolic vicariate. Van der Noot remained a priest, although such a jurisdiction would normally be headed by a titular bishop. The apostolic vicariate became a fully fledged diocese on 27 December 1870, without being incorporated into any ecclesiastical province. After the dissolutions of the French Revolution, new monastic orders and congregations were founded in the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Some of these still undertake social and educational work to this day, as well as being active in the pastoral and contemplative sphere: sisters of the Order of Saint Elisabeth, sisters of Saint Francis of the Divine Mercy, sisters of the Christian doctrine, sisters of the Poor Child Jesus, Lay Carmelites, Benedictine of the Perpetual Adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament; Redemptorists, Charitable Friars, Priests of the Sacred-Heart, Benedictine in Clervaux, etc. During World War II, when Luxembourg was occupied by Nazi Germany, the Catholic Church was relatively silent. It took no public stance regarding the fate of the Jews or the Nazi regime. On the one hand, the Bishop, Joseph Laurent Philippe, was bedridden due to illness, and was therefore in no state to provide active opposition. On the other hand, the Bishop did not want to further antagonise the occupiers and endanger the already fragile religious life of the Church, which was heavily restricted during wartime. Bishop Philippe did, however, refuse to meet with the Nazi leadership, and made preparations in case his post should fall vacant. The Church saw its very existence threatened as it was pushed out of public life by the anti-religious policies of the Nazis: public religious events such as the Octave celebration or the dancing procession were banned, Christian organisations were dissolved, religious education in schools was abolished, and a ban on the religious orders was put in place. At the same time, the diocese administration remained one of very few Luxembourgish institutions that stayed intact during the war, although this was in doubt for a while, and a deportation of the Bishop was considered by the occupation authorities. The Catholic Church in Luxembourg attempted to adapt itself to modern requirements through the 4th Luxembourg Diocesan Synod (1972-1981), following on from the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). The Church wanted to establish a level of dialogue with and opening up towards modern culture and the world. On 23 April 1988, it was raised to the rank of archdiocese, immediately subject to the Holy See. The establishment of the Council of Christian Churches in 1997 indicated a certain emphasis on ecumenism between Christian churches. The current Archbishop of Luxembourg, since 12 July 2011, is Jean-Claude Hollerich.http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/27815.php?index=27815‚ü®=en  Situation  The archdiocese is not a metropolitan see, having no suffragans. At the end of 2010, the archdiocese estimated its membership at 396,500, out of a total population of 502,000, and reported that it had 275 parishes, 151 diocesan priests, 56 religious priests, 6 permanent deacons, 70 religious brothers and 566 religious sisters.Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 ), p. 423 However, the numbers of Catholics actually attending Mass is on the decline, as reflected by amalgamations of parishes and deconsecrations of churches. The state and Catholic Church in Luxembourg have a relationship where they recognise each other's autonomy, while still engaging in different forms of cooperation. This cooperation is governed by the Luxembourg Constitution, and various laws and conventions. There is a certain degree of collaboration in the social-charitable and educational sectors between both actors: the Church provides religious education in public schools, private schools are part-financed by the state. The state also pays the salaries of the ministers of the main Christian churches as well as the Jewish community. Currently under discussion is the disestablishment of the Church in Luxembourg, whereby the State would cease to hold financial responsibility for the Church. A 1996 survey (not a census) reported Catholics 88%, including the royal family; Protestants and similar 1%; other religions 1%; no religion 9%; no reply 1%.

Booligal is a part of Hay Shire local government area. The name of the village is an anglicisation of an Aboriginal word meaning either (1) 'windy place', or (2) 'large swamp', 'place of flooded box trees'.Reed, A. W., Place-names of New South Wales: Their Origin and Meanings (Reed: 1969); Reed, A. W., Aboriginal Place Names (Reed: 1967). History Booligal is situated on the traditional boundary of the Muthi Muthi and Nari Nari Aboriginal tribes. Township beginnings The site where Booligal township developed was originally a crossing-place on the Lachlan River on the \\"Boolegal\\" pastoral run (which had been taken up by the Tom brothers). The township developed on the opposite side of the river to \\"Boolegal\\" station (later known as \\"Bank\\" station). The builder Edward Roset and his family were living at the locality by about 1856. Edward Roset‚Äôs wife Bridget died on 27 February 1857, just one week after her 22-month-old daughter had died of dysentery; Bridget Roset and her daughter were the first interments in the Booligal cemetery. Edward Roset constructed a hotel at Booligal (possibly in collaboration with Neil McColl), which probably operated initially as a sly- grog shop. In 1859 Robert Whiteus was operating a punt at the locality.‚ÄòLower Murrumbidgee‚Äô correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald, 31 March 1857, p. 3; Plain Facts of the One Tree Plain, compiled by Ruth K. Smith, 1977; ‚ÄòRecollections of Lang‚Äôs Crossing Place (Part II)‚Äô, Riverine Grazier, 22 December 1883; Crossley, Norman, Beyond the Lachlan: A History of Tom's Lake and the Crossley Family, 2005. The township of Booligal was laid out by Surveyor Edward Twynam and gazetted as a township in July 1860.Bushby, John E.P., Saltbush Country: History of the Deniliquin District, 1980, p. 152. In December 1860 it was reported that a store and two public-houses were being erected in the new township. Licences for the two hotels were initially refused by the Bench of Magistrates at Hay \\"on account of there being no police belonging to the locality\\".‚ÄòLower Murrumbidgee‚Äô correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald, 8 January 1861, p. 3 On appeal however the applications for licences at Booligal were granted. Neil McColl became the licensee of the Drovers' Arms Hotel (possibly the renovated Roset's hotel) and John Ledwidge was granted a licence for the Booligal Hotel. On 31 January 1861 ‚Äì \\"the first red letter day at this new township on the Lower Lachlan\\" ‚Äì both hotels were opened to the public.‚ÄòLower Murrumbidgee‚Äô correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald, 11 February 1861, p. 2. In March 1861 the Adelaide firm of Randell and Scott opened a store at Booligal. The manager, Thomas Hitchcox, was briefly postmaster. Booligal Post Office opened on 7 March 1861 (it was closed between 1866 and 1881). In August 1862 it was reported that both hotels at Booligal were closed and the two publicans were insolvent. Hitchcock resigned as storekeeper to take over the licence of the Booligal Hotel. Another Adelaide firm, Morgan and Pollard, opened a second store at Booligal by 1863, managed by Henry N. Smith, who became postmaster until his death in June 1868.Busby, op. cit., p. 152; Pastoral Times, 23 August 1862, p. 2. 1870 to 1900 Historic court house During 1871-2 Edward Roset had a bridge built over the Lachlan River at Booligal: \\"Mr. Roset is showing himself a man of extraordinary public spirit, he is bridging the Lachlan with an immensely strong bridge, the piles are three feet diameter at the butt, and driven twelve feet into the bed of the river; the approaches are excellent, and work to the present time has cost over ¬£2,000, and it is half done\\". Roset‚Äôs new bridge (for which he charged a toll for its use) was opened for sheep traffic on 3 September 1872 (and for general traffic later in the year). The bridge, which still remains at the lower end of Lachlan Street, was built above flood level and flanked by extensive banked-up approaches.Hay Standard, 28 February 1872, p. 2; Hay Standard, 11 September 1872, p. 2. In April 1877 it was reported that Booligal consisted of nineteen buildings, including a court-house, two hotels, two stores, a blacksmith's shop and two butchers' shops, as well as a school-house and a parsonage. The school-house and parsonage were new buildings, still incomplete. At that stage the population of Booligal was over 100 persons.'The Western Riverina: A History of Its Development' by James Jervis (Royal Australian Historical Society Journal and Proceedings Vol. XXXVIII 1952), pp. 141-2 (citing The Sydney Mail, 7 April 1877). In 1878 the telegraph line was extended to Booligal. Booligal‚Äôs position on the direct transport route linking the Murrumbidgee and Darling rivers ensured its importance in the district during the latter half of the 19th century. Drays hauling wool from stations north of the Lachlan passed through the township in large numbers, and station supplies were transported in the opposite direction. Booligal was a major stopping- place for the mail and passenger coach travelling between Hay and Wilcannia on the Darling River. In 1890 Booligal had a population of about 500 people. 1901 to the present A new public bridge was built at Booligal in 1912 (replaced in 1984 by the current concrete structure). A telephone exchange was opened there on 3 June 1913.Crossley, op. cit. In 1914 the transport link between Hay and Wilcannia ceased to operate. Booligal had been experiencing a steady decline, especially since the protracted drought at the turn of the century. Many residents of the town and district moved to the new township of Griffith after the First World War.Bushby, op. cit. In 1967 a memorial to explorer and surveyor John Oxley was erected at Booligal; the monument is in the form of a giant theodolite set in stone.‚ÄòBooligal‚Äô , Walkabout: Australian Travel Guide, FairfaxDigital. Facilities Public school The village of Booligal has a general store and post office. There is a cricket oval for the occasional social game, shaded eating areas, playground and toilet facilities. The Booligal Hotel offers cold beverages, food and accommodation.

Gaylor (August 19, 1926 - April 15, 2008) was a Houston businessman best known as the founder of Al's Formal Wear. Education Gaylor was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and attended the University of Tulsa on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in marketing and accounting. After graduation, he took a job with Acme Brick, who relocated him to Topeka, Kansas. At that time, he and his brother-in-law Al Sankary began talking about going into business together. Business interests In 1957, Gaylor and his wife Lillian opened their first Al's Formal Wear Al's Formal Wear tuxedo shop in downtown Houston, Texas. In 1966, after moving the tuxedo store to a larger location nearby, the Gaylors opened their first Bride 'n Formal store in the original Al's space. Bride 'n Formal offered moderately-priced bridal gowns, bridesmaids' dresses, and formal dresses, and the two businesses created a cross-referral synergy. Gaylor and brother-in-law Al Sankary divided the business in 1978, with Gaylor maintaining ownership of the Al's Formal Wear operations based in Houston, while Sankary owned the operations based in the Dallas area. This division occasionally led to some customer confusion, but persisted until 1999 (see below). In the late 1980s, Gaylor opened a new upscale bridal boutique, Louise Blum, named for his mother. He also began a new line of Ascot Tuxedos stores to expand into the area served by the Al's of Dallas operation. In the early 1990s, Gaylor opened an upscale men's formal wear shop, A.B. Graham, named for his first grandson. He also expanded his bridal business again with Bridal Warehouse, an off-the-rack bridal gown store designed to serve the price shopper. In 1995, Bridal Warehouse and Bride 'n Formal were merged into BridesMart, offering both special-order and off-the- rack bridal shopping in one location. The synergy between the bridal business and the tuxedo business continued, with BridesMart locations typically located near (or even next to) Al's Formal Wear and Ascot Tuxedos locations. Al's Formal Wear had always been a family business, and 1999 saw the family come together again as his Al's Formal Wear of Houston bought the Dallas operation from Sankary. At this point, the combined business included approximately 120 Al's Formal Wear, Ascot Tuxedos, and BridesMart locations in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. By 2006, some consolidation and the spinoff of the bridal division has reduced the number of stores to between 90 and 100. After expanding into Arkansas and the purchase of Mr. Neat's Formalwear of Colorado, Al's Formal Wear now encompasses five states with over 100 stores. After more than 50 years of building a tuxedo empire for his family, Gaylor turned over the presidency to his son Stuart in 2001. Since he took the reins, the company has continued to flourish. Gaylor is currently building more stores in new markets and has plans for many more in the near future. According to Gaylor, \\"Our business from day one was built on providing excellent customer service and quality merchandise at affordable prices, and we continue to build our business on this premise today\\". Death Gaylor died on the morning of April 15, 2008. He was survived by four children and 12 grandchildren. Awards and recognition * In 1992, Gaylor was a finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. * In 1995, he was presented with the International Formalwear Association Black Tie Award in recognition of his lifetime contribution to the men's formal wear industry. Business philosophy Gaylor believes that good will, excellent customer service, and effort are vital to business success. \\"The guy that gets the farthest in the business world is the guy that works the hardest,\\" he says (Waller, 1999).

However, most of the park is undeveloped and difficult to access. Attractions include Khagiin Khar Lake, a 20m deep glacial lake 80 km upstream from the tourist camps, and Yestii Hot Water Springs, natural hot springs 18 km further upstream. The park also has a Buddhist monastery that is open to visitors. Park wildlife includes brown bears and over 250 species of birds. The Tuul River flows through the park. The park has many rock formations for rock climbers, and includes two famous formations named for things they resemble: Turtle Rock (Mongolian: Melkhii Khad) and the Old Man Reading a Book (Praying Lama Rock).

He is also active in Killer Be Killed and Gone Is Gone, as well as being the current touring bassist for Thin Lizzy. Biography Sanders performing in 2006 Sanders first played when he had picked up his older brother Kyle's bass and decided to try it out, even though the bass was strung for a lefty, and he was right-handed. A few months later, he had talked his dad into buying him a bass. He started first playing in such bands as Four Hour Fogger, Knuckle and Puaka Balava. In 1995, Sanders joined the grindcore band Social Infestation as the bass player. Social Infestation has released one EP and two full length albums. The band hasn't released any material since 2000 and are seemingly taking a long hiatus or the band has split. In 2000, Sanders met Brann Dailor and Bill Kelliher along with Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show and later formed Mastodon. The four began a new musical venture with then singer Eric Saner, touring the Southern United States, working 40-hour weeks and committing to the band in their spare time. The band's mainstream success would ensue after Saner left the band, pushing Sanders to the forefront not just as a bassist, but as a vocalist also, the duties of which he would share with Hinds. In 2012, Sanders joined the supergroup Killer Be Killed, founded by The Dillinger Escape Plan vocalist Greg Puciato and Soulfly/ex-Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera. The band had been working on a lineup and material before announcing their name in October 2013.Project Featuring MAX CAVALERA, GREG PUCIATO, TROY SANDERS Gets Name Blabbermouth.net.

March 10, 2014. Retrieved March 10, 2014. In 2016, Sanders formed Gone Is Gone, a supergroup also consisting of Troy Van Leeuwen, a guitar player for Queens of the Stone Age, Tony Hajjar, the drummer for At the Drive-In, and Mike Zarin, a multi- instrumentalist who appeared with Van Leeuwen on Sweethead's Descent To The Surface. They released an EP in the summer of 2016, shortly followed by a studio album, Echolocation, the following year. Since then, the band has continued to record together, releasing singles in 2018 and 2019.  Personal life  Sanders is married and has two children, a son and a daughter. Sanders has two brothers, Kyle and Darren, who are both involved in music. Kyle was the bassist of Bloodsimple, and is in MonstrO, and metal supergroup Hellyeah; while Darren is \\"a one man road crew\\" and bass tech for Mastodon. Influence and style Sanders in 2009 Musical style Sanders plays primarily fingerstyle, although he sometimes uses a pick, and usually steps out of the guitar parts in Mastodon, and composes his basslines on his own. He has shown a wide variety of playing styles and techniques, so he is known as a very flexible player. Singing style Sanders performs clean and harsh vocals in Mastodon, where he shares lead vocal duties with Brent Hinds and Brann Dailor. His harsher vocal style is similar to Dave Edwardson of Neurosis and Buzz Osborne of the Melvins, utilizing low growls but not low enough to be death grunts. His harsh vocalism was largely applied in Mastodon's earlier Lifesblood and Remission. In Mastodon's more recent albums, Leviathan through Emperor of Sand, Sanders utilizes a different range of clean vocals along with his harsher style. Influences Sanders has cited Cliff Burton from Metallica, Gene Simmons from Kiss, and Phil Lynott from Thin Lizzy as some of the major influences on his bass playing. He has also stated in interviews that his favorite albums are Men at Work's Business as Usual, Neurosis' Times of Grace, and George Jones' Anniversary ‚Äì 10 Years of Hits. Adding to that list, in a 2005 interview, he also mentioned Through Silver in Blood by Neurosis, Sailing the Seas of Cheese by Primus, Melvins' Stoner Witch, Metallica's Ride the Lightning, and White Pony by Deftones as some of his favorites.

Hinds is also lead guitarist/singer for the surfabilly band Fiend Without a Face, and is involved in other projects, including classic rock bands The Blood Vessels, West End Motel, Four Hour Fogger, The Last of the Blue Eyed Devils, Giraffe Tongue Orchestra, and Legend of the Seagullmen. Biography In Mastodon's early years, Hinds would work as a full-time carpenter when not touring to promote the band. Hinds left Alabama for Atlanta, Georgia in pursuit of a music career. It was at this time that he met Troy Sanders, a future member of Mastodon. According to Sanders, he \\"lived in his van for the next five years\\", becoming a member of Sanders' then band, Four Hour Fogger. The first practice he attended with this band he allegedly \\"showed up so wasted he couldn't even play\\". Once Four Hour Fogger fell apart, the two stuck together, eventually meeting Brann Dailor and Bill Kelliher at a High on Fire concert in \\"their friend's basement\\". The four began a new musical venture with then singer Eric Saner, touring the southern US, working 40-hour weeks and committing to the band in their spare time. The band's mainstream success would ensue after Saner left the band, pushing Hinds to the forefront not just as a guitarist, but as a vocalist also, the duties of which he would share with Sanders. Hinds continues to concentrate on Mastodon, with the majority of his time spent touring or in the studio. He also enjoys promoting his lesser-known psychedelic rockabilly band Fiend Without a Face and his classic rock band the Blood Vessels. Hinds composed the score to Jonah Hex. On June 7, 2011 Hinds' projects Fiend Without a Face and West End Motel released a split-double CD debut studio album.

He also has two custom First Act guitars: a 6-string used in the video for \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" (which has asymmetrical horns such as those seen on a Mosrite guitar, a Bigsby vibrato, silverburst finish, and a Mastodon logo inlaid on the headstock) and a 12-string DC Lola, also with a silverburst finish, used on the Unholy Alliance 3 tour to capture a fuller sound while guitarist Bill Kelliher was too ill to perform. Hinds owns a guitar similar to this one, though his has only nine strings. He also used a 1964 Fender Stratocaster and a 1952 Fender Telecaster while recording \\"Crack the Skye\\". During live performances, Hinds favors his various Silverburst Flying V's. He often performs the solos and more melodic parts, whereas Bill Kelliher takes rhythm duties.

Influence and style Hinds performing in 2009 Originally playing the banjo, Hinds learned his \\"signature style\\" of fast hybrid picking by emulating banjo fingerings on guitar. He frequently utilizes the minor pentatonic, natural minor, and the harmonic minor scales in his playing as well as many hammer-ons, pull-offs, and legato slides. Hinds grew up listening to country, but when he entered his late teens he started listening to Neurosis and Melvins, bands that would have a profound influence on his musicianship. Hinds has also stated that he is a big fan of the progressive and psychedelic rock genres, especially from the '70s. On June 12, 2007, Hinds and bandmate Bill Kelliher won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods award for best shredders. Hinds was featured along with Kelliher on the cover of Guitar Worlds 300th issue alongside guitar legends like Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, and Kirk Hammett. Hinds performs clean and harsh vocals in Mastodon, where he shares lead vocal duties with Troy Sanders and more recently, Brann Dailor. Personal life Hinds has a strong affinity for smoking marijuana, and places doubt on the narrative that America is a free country. In an online interview, he stated that he smokes marijuana almost every day. Hinds is quoted as follows: \\"They say that if, you know, terrorists and like the freedom haters wanna blow up America because we're so free but why don't they fucking turn Holland into dust because you guys are the freest people in the world?\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8qXc1vjosE Discography Mastodon *Remission (2002) - Lead guitar, vocals *Leviathan (2004) - Lead guitar, vocals *Blood Mountain (2006) - Lead guitar, vocals *Crack the Skye (2009) - Lead guitar, banjo, vocals *The Hunter (2011) - Lead guitar, vocals *Once More 'Round the Sun (2014) - Lead guitar, vocals *Emperor of Sand (2017) - Lead guitar, vocals *Cold Dark Place (2017) - Lead guitars, vocals, lap-steel, claps (track 3) Fiend Without a Face *Brent Hinds Presents: Fiend Without a Face & West End Motel (2011) *Fiend Without a Face (2017) West End Motel *Brent Hinds Presents: Fiend Without a Face & West End Motel (2011) *Only Time Can Tell (2012) *Bad with Names, Good with Faces (2017) Giraffe Tongue Orchestra *Broken Lines (2016) Legend of the Seagullmen *Legend of the Seagullmen (2018)  Guest appearances  * \\"Days of Self Destruction\\" by CKY on the album The Phoenix (guitar solos) * \\"Make You Mine\\" by The Black Lips on the album Underneath the Rainbow (guitar) * \\"Horse Hunter\\" by The Dillinger Escape Plan on the album Ire Works (vocals) * \\"White Dwarf\\" by Zoroaster on the album Voice of Saturn (guitar solo and backing vocals) * \\"At Arms Length\\" by Mouth of the Architect on the album The Ties That Blind (vocals) * Jonah Hex as a Union soldier (film cameo) * Hinds, along with Brann Dailor, appears on Killswitch Engage's live album (Set This) World Ablaze, in \\"From the Bedroom to the Basement\\" - documentary. * In July 2011 Hinds starred in a commercial for Elmyr, a restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia. * In the Game of Thrones episode Hardhome, Hinds and bandmates Brann Dailor and Bill Kelliher portrayed an extras role, as Wildlings and later in the episode as reanimated Wights.

A funfair in Passau, Germany Finnish funfair Suomen Tivoli in Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland A traveling carnival (US English), usually simply called a carnival, or travelling funfair (UK English) is an amusement show that may be made up of amusement rides, food vendors, merchandise vendors, games of chance and skill, thrill acts, and animal acts. A traveling carnival is not set up at a permanent location, like an amusement park or funfair, but is moved from place to place. Its roots are similar to the 19th century circus with both being fitted-up in open fields near or in town and moving to a new location after a period of time. In fact, many carnivals have circuses while others have a clown aesthetic in their decor. Unlike traditional carnival celebrations, the North American traveling carnival is not tied to a religious observance. Larger fairs such as the permanent fairs of cities and seaside resorts might be called a fairground, although technically this refers to the land where a fair is traditionally held. In 1893, the Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition (also called the Chicago World's Fair) was the catalyst for the development of the traveling carnival. The Chicago World's Fair had an area that included rides, games of chance, freak shows, and burlesque. After the Chicago World's Fair, traveling carnival companies began touring the United States.citation needed Due to the type of acts featured along with sometimes using dishonest business practices, the traveling carnivals were often looked down upon. Modern traveling carnivals usually make contracts with local governments in order to play both state and county fairs, as well as smaller venues (such as store parking lots, church bazaars, volunteer fire department fund raisers, and civic celebrations). History Savage's amusement ride, Sea-On-Land, where the riders would pitch up and down as if they were on the sea. His \\"galloping horse\\" innovation is seen on carousels today. A ferris wheel in Amsterdam, Netherlands paratrooper and the Matterhorn, include spinning people at high speed coupled with other accelerations. Originally, a fair would also have had a significant number of market stalls; today this is rare and most sidestalls only offer food or games. The first fairground rides began to appear in the 18th century. These were small, made of wood and propelled by gangs of boys. In the 19th century, before the development of mechanical attractions, sideshows were the mainstay of most funfairs. Typical shows included menageries of wild animals, freak shows, wax works, boxing/wrestling challenges, and theatrical shows. In 1868, Frederick Savage, an agricultural engineer from King's Lynn, devised a method of driving rides by steam. His invention, a steam engine mounted in the center of the ride, transformed the fairground industry in England and around the world. The preeminent carousel maker in the 19th century, his fairground machinery was exported globally.\\"Frederick Savage, Victorian fairground manufacturer of King's Lynn\\". Norfolk.gov.uk. Retrieved 25 February 2018 United States Through most of the 19th century, rural North America enjoyed the entertainment of traveling shows. These shows could include a circus, vaudeville show, burlesque show, or a magic lantern show. It is believed that the 1893 Chicago World's Fair was the catalyst that brought about the modern traveling carnival. At the Chicago World's Fair was an avenue at the edge of the grounds called the Midway Plaisance. This avenue of the fair had games of chance, freak shows, wild west shows (including Buffalo Bill whose show was set up near the fairground) and burlesque shows. It also featured the original Ferris Wheel, constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. Following the Chicago World's Fair, the term \\"midway\\" was adopted from the Midway Plaisance to denote the area at county and state fairs where sideshow entertainment was located. Otto Schmitt, a showman at the world's fair, formed Chicago Midway Plaisance Amusement Company. The company featured thirteen acts, including some from the World's Fair, and began a tour of the northeast US. His company closed due to poor business practices before completing its first tour. Some members of his company formed successful traveling carnivals after Otto Schmitt's company closed. The appeal of this new type of entertainment was embraced. In 1902, there were seventeen traveling carnivals in the US. The number grew to 46 in 1905; by 1937 there was an estimated 300 carnivals touring the country. One such show, The \\"IT Shows\\", set up yearly on probably every empty sandlot in NY's Brooklyn, Queens, and surrounding areas. Operations Ticket booths Worldwide there are many different traveling carnival companies. Most carnivals are not made up of just one operator of rides, food or games. Many of these venues are operated by independent owners who contract (or \\"book\\") with the carnival. These independent owners are contract to pay the carnival operator a percentage of what their ride or stand gross in sales. It is common for the independent owners within a traveling carnival to be related, or have intertwined family histories. Many carnival operators are so big that they have carnival \\"units\\" or divisions. Each of these units may consist of six or more major rides. By having these units, a carnival operator can have a carnival operating in many different areas during the same week. Rides and stands are generally transported by truck. The rides generally have wheels mounted on the base and the rest of the ride is then dismantled and folded up to allow for over the road transport. Food stands are usually tow-behind trailers, although there are still some booths that require complete take down and packing. Some large carnival operators use the railroad to transport their equipment from one location to another. A traveling carnival operator may schedule their carnival for certain seasons. They will have their carnivals in warm climate southern areas and then move into northern regions during the warmer months. Admission is often charged for county or state fairs, but is usually free at most carnivals. Tickets or all-day passes are usually sold for rides. When a carnival is \\"playing\\" a fair, exhibits or displays may charge their own entry fee, as well as some entertainment acts (such as a music concert, tractor pulling, or a demolition derby). Food Ohio State Fair food stands There are food stands at carnivals which serve a variety of food and beverages. They offer snack items like cotton candy, ice cream, fried dough, funnel cake, candy, or caramel apples and french fries. Meal items may include pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, and chicken. Beverages may include soda, coffee, tea, and lemonade. Local and regional specialties, along with ethnic foods, are often available such as Empanadas and Tacos. At autumn and winter carnivals, drinks like hot cider and hot chocolate may be available. Junk food items like deep fried candy bars, the deep-fried Twinkie, Dippin' Dots ice cream, the blooming onion, and \\"deep-fried butter on-a-stick\\" are some of the delicacies that can be found at carnival food stands. Games Duck Pond game At many traveling carnivals, there are games of chance and skill. Games like the \\"Crossbow Shoot\\" game or the \\"Balloon and Darts\\" game will test an individuals target shooting ability. Other games, such as the \\"Water gun\\" game, will pit a group of individuals against each other to win the game. Chance is involved in games like the \\"Duck Pond\\" game or the \\"Pingpong Ball\\" and \\"Fishbowl\\" games. Most games offer a small prize to the winner. Prizes may be stuffed animals, toys, posters, etc. Continued play is encouraged as multiple small prizes may traded in for a larger prize. Some more difficult games, including the \\"Baseball and Basket\\" or \\"Stand the Bottle\\" game, may offer a large prize to any winner. While the majority of game operators run honest games, some people are wary of carnival games. This may be because carnival games in the past gained a reputation for being dishonest. The term \\"mark\\" (slang term: \\"sucker\\") originated with the carnival. When dishonest carnival game operators found someone who they could entice to keep playing their \\"rigged\\" (slang term: \\"gaffed\\") game, they would then \\"mark\\" the player by patting their back with a hand that had chalk on it. Other game operators would then look for these chalk marks and entice the individual to also play their rigged game. This is not common practice anymore, although there still are a few confidence men in the carnival business. Learning about how carnival games work can help an individual from being cheated. Side stalls and games A traditional coconut shy, established in 1936 by Mrs E. Harris, is still being run by her son today. Most stalls feature games of skill or strength. The most traditional example being the coconut shy in which players throw balls at coconuts balanced on posts, winning the coconut if they manage to dislodge it. Other side stalls range from the trivially easy, such as hooking rubber ducks from a water trough in which nearly every player is expected to win a prize, to the deceptively challenging, which includes games which utilize optical illusions or physical relationships that are difficult to judge. Highly profitable (and therefore timeless) games include: *the hoopla, in which a ring can be demonstrated to fit neatly around a wooden block, but when the customer attempts to throw the ring over the block, it is nearly impossible to achieve the perfect angle which the attendant deftly demonstrates. There is also a con where the blocks sit up straight with money on as well as a prize and it looks easy to win. The cheat here is that the worker will show you the ring fits and when you have a go he passes you 3 rings that do not fit. The ring that does is called a \\"coping\\" ring. However, most of the time this in practice is not necessary as this type of game is based on luck, therefore the odds favor the owner. This game is similar to quoits and horseshoe pitching. *ball-in-the-basket games in which the basket is presented at an angle almost certain to bounce the ball out. (The basket bottom may also be springy.) *basketball-shooting games in which the basket is ovoid in shape and the basketball cannot fit inside the rim under any circumstances, but takes advantage of the oval shape an individual expects to see when directly confronted by a circle presented at an angle nearly parallel with the ground. (The sides of such a game are walled with netting which presumably keeps the ball in play, but the netting is typically covered with the prizes the customer hopes to win, which block the view of the basket from the side and thus exposing the hoax.) Sometimes the basketballs are also inflated to their full capacity, thus allowing the ball to bounce out of the hoop more easily. *archery, air rifles, and paint ball guns with sometimes misaligned sights (or handled by someone who cannot shoot straight), with targets ranging from bulls eyes to playing cards. *Hit-The-Bell, high striker device to test prowess, originally fabricated from various hardware. Much of the true \\"con artistry\\" has been driven out of funfairs in the twentieth century, and combined with an increasing emphasis on the role of families and small children in such entertainment, contemporary showmen often find greater profit in pricing their games far above the value of the prizes being offered, with complex formula for upgrading to the large prizes that advertise the game and instill desire among customers. The rises in pricing of many side stalls must often reflect the overheads of running fairground equipment ‚Äì the cost of swag, diesel, staff, and rents. Typical prizes change to reflect popular tastes. A traditional fairground prize used to be a goldfish in a small plastic bag, but these have fallen out of favor, partly because goldfish are no longer seen as exotic, but also because of animal welfare concerns. Many stalls offer cuddly toys as prizes.

Some rides are for young children and may include a carousel, ridable miniature railway, miniature roller coaster, or an inflatable bounce house. For older children and adults, there can be many different types of rides. These rides are designed to use height, speed, g-force, or centrifugal force to appeal to the riders' senses. Some examples are the Chair-O-Planes, Ferris wheel, Zipper ride, and the Tilt-A-Whirl. The rides are generally painted in bright vibrant colors such as red, yellow and orange. Multicolored lighting is also used to enhance the rides' appearance at night. Each ride also plays its own music: a carousel may have calliope music playing while the ride next to it may have rock music for its riders. The music for each ride is usually upbeat; however, a ride such as a ghost train will have more somber music. These rides are designed to be quickly set up and taken down, thus helping the carnival operator in moving them. Some state governments have agencies that inspect carnival rides to ensure the safety of the riders. Regulation varies by jurisdiction. Thrill rides There is constant innovation, with new variations on ways to spin and throw passengers around, in an effort to attract customers. With the requirement that rides be packed into one or more trailers for travel, there is a limit to the size of the rides, and funfairs struggle to compete with much larger attractions, such as roller coasters, found in amusement parks. See also amusement rides. Roller coasters Some fairs may feature compact roller coasters to attract teenagers and preteens. Roller coasters feature steep drops, sharp curves, and sometimes loops. Roller coasters are generally the most attractive aspect of a fair, but many people come for other reasons. Fairs usually only feature one or two coasters. Children's rides Children's ride. Chennai, India Funfairs are seen as family entertainment, and most include a significant number of children's rides. Many of these are smaller, platform based rides like, cup & saucer, toy sets, train rides, as well as smaller slower versions of the adult rides, Ferris wheels, waltzers, even children's bumper cars. Such rides are usually referred to as \\"juvenile rides\\" or just \\"juveniles\\". There are also other items for children such as slides, mirror mazes fun houses, and variations on the bouncy castle.

Admission to see these curiosities or exhibits required an extra fee. Some sideshows featured a single exhibit, but some had multiple acts or exhibits under one tent (slang term: Ten-in-One). Human acts may include people with multiple arms or legs, midgets, extremely tall people, obese people, people born with facial or other deformities, and tattooed people. The term used for this type of show was called a freak show. Animal oddities such as the two-headed calf, the miniature horse, etc., were featured in the freak show as well. Changing public opinions and increased medical knowledge have led to a decline of these type of shows. Another type of act at the sideshow was the thrill act. Examples of these acts included fire eaters, sword swallowers, the human blockhead, the human pin cushion, and knife throwers. Some of these types of acts, such as the human fountain, were later found to be fakes. Daredevil shows like the globe of death which features motorcycles performing inside an enclosed sphere or a high diving act were sometimes included. Burlesque shows (slang term: kootch shows) were also part of the traveling carnival for a time as well. Displays like Bonnie and Clyde's death car or Hitler's staff car were also seen at some traveling carnivals.

It is currently unknown if the majority of these trails are still listed since many of the provincial highways of Ontario were decommissioned in 1997 and 1998, as the Tourist Trails followed the provincial highways for the majority of their length, although many sections travel along county roads and municipal/local streets as well. Although many municipalities, cities, and counties still sign these tourist routes, others may have chosen to discontinue them with the highways they followed, rendering them as historical footnotes.  African-Canadian Heritage Tour  African-Canadian Heritage Tour logo The African-Canadian Heritage Tour (ACHT) is a designated trail along several county and city roads, and provincial highways. The trail starts on Queen Street in the Sandwich neighbourhood of Windsor, Ontario. It turns west at Prince Road, before turning south along Sandwich Street. It curves along Sandwich Parkway to Ojibway Parkway, formerly Highway 18. The trail follows County Road 20 to Amherstburg to County Road 10, which turns onto. It travels east along Middle Side Road towards the community of McGregor. The route turns north along County Road 9 (Howard Avenue) back to Windsor, Ontario. The ACHT turns east briefly along Highway 3, before turning onto Highway 401 eastbound to exit 28, County Road 25 (Puce Road). From there it travels to the town of Puce. The trail turns east along County Road 22 through Belle River until it meets County Road 42 southeast of the town. The trail turns and follows it through Tilbury, becoming Chatham-Kent Road 2, formerly Highway 2. The route turns south onto County Road 7 (Merlin Road) through the small community of Fletcher before turning east onto County Road 14 (8th Line). It follows County Road 14 through North Buxton to Highway 40. Upon reaching Highway 40, the trail follows it for through Chatham. It turns right along County Road 29 (Countryview Line) and heads northeast through Turnerville, turning north at County Road 29 (Lindsay Road). It follows this road to its terminus in Dresden, where the Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site can be found.  Algonquin Trail  The Algonquin Trail is a loop north from Highway 401 through Algonquin Park and back to Highway 7.The route starts at the Highway 35 / Highway 115 and Highway 401 interchange (exit 436) in Newcastle. At the split of Highway 35/115, the trail follows Highway 35 north through Lindsay, Ontario and travels along a brief concurrency with Highway 7. It continues north along Highway 35 through Coboconk, Minden, Carnarvon and Dorset to Highway 60. From here, the trail turns east and crosses Algonquin Provincial Park. East of the park, Highway 60 meets Highway 41. The trail turns south along that road, passes through Eganville, Ontario and terminates at Highway 7. The route is not signed.  Bluewater Route  Bluewater Route logo The Bluewater Route follows Highway 21 along the shore of Lake Huron between Highway 402 and Owen Sound. The route passes through the small towns of Grand Bend, Goderich and Kincardine, as well as passing by the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station.  Deer Trail Route  The Deer Trail Route is a circular route in the Algoma Region of northern Ontario. Though it is circular, it has a \\"starting\\" point at the junction of Highway 17 and Highway 108 in Serpent River. It follows Highway 108 for its entire length, travelling through Elliot Lake, until the road becomes Highway 639. At the northern terminus of Highway 639, the road then turns back south along Highway 546 to its intersection with Highway 17 in Iron Bridge. From there it travels back along Highway 17 through Blind River, Algoma Mills and Spragge to Serpent River at a total distance of approximately . The route serves mainly as an access route to wilderness recreation areas such as Mississagi Provincial Park. It also serves as a venue for an annual Deer Trail Studio Tour, a regional arts festival in which various venues along the route display and sell the work of local artists and craftspeople.Deer Trail Studio Tour to brighten region this month. Elliot Lake Standard, September 2008.  Frontier Route  The Frontier Route travels through Northern Ontario from the Manitoba border to Barrie. The route travels along Highway 17 through Kenora, Dryden, Ignace, and Thunder Bay to the Highway 11 intersection in Nipigon. From there, the Route follows Highway 11 across northern Ontario and south through Muskoka. It passes through the towns of Geraldton, Longlac, Hearst, Kapuskasing, Smooth Rock Falls, Cochrane, Iroquois Falls, Kirkland Lake, New Liskeard, North Bay, Huntsville, Bracebridge, Gravenhurst, and Orillia, before terminating at Highway 400 in Barrie. Until Highway 11 was decommissioned as a provincial highway south of Barrie, it continued south to the Gardiner Expressway in downtown Toronto. This trail also follows the Voyageur Route for a portion of its length.  Georgian Bay Coastal Route  The Georgian Bay Coastal Route is a signed northeasternontario.com/how-to-explore-northeastern-ontario-provincial- parks/following-the-georgian-bay-coastal-route/ route around the Georgian Bay https://www.northeasternontario.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/05/NeONT_MotoMap_2019.pdf The MS Chi-Cheemaun Ferry connects Manitoulin Island to Tobermory  Golden Highway  The Golden Highway travels through Northern Ontario and the Abitibi-T√©miscamingue region of Quebec It begins in Timmins along Highway 101, and progresses east to Highway 11 in Matheson. It heads south on Highway 11 to Kenogami Lake, then turns east towards Kirkland Lake and the Quebec boundary along Highway 66. A branch also travels west along Highway 66 from Kenogami Lake to Matachewan. Thus, the entire length of Highway 66 is part of the Golden Highway. The Golden Highway continues in Quebec as Route 117 through the city of Rouyn- Noranda before terminating in Val-d'Or.  Great River Road  The Great River Road loops through the northwestern section of the province. It begins in Kenora and travels east along Highway 17 to Highway 71, where it heads south, staying close to Lake of the Woods. It meets Highway 11 in Barwick, branching into two directions: one spur travels west along Highway 11 to Rainy River, while the main route travels east along Highway 11 to Fort Frances. The eastern branch continues to Highway 502, travelling back up towards Dryden, and looping back west along Highway 17 to Kenora.  Heritage Highway  Heritage Highway logo The Heritage Highway, also known as Historic Highway, travels from Windsor to Gasp√©, Quebec along much of what was formerly Highway 2 and Quebec Route 2, now Route 138 (Chemin du Roy) and Route 132. The 1972 designation originally included various spur routes and connections to destinations such as Niagara Falls, Stratford, Sarnia, Ottawa-Hull and Sault Ste. Marie. One spur continued along the Detroit River on Highway 18, now Essex County Road 20. It followed the northern shore of Lake Erie east to Leamington. It then continued along Highway 3 to Wainfleet, before terminating at Fort Erie. Another spur along Highway 11 met Highway 17, the Voyageur Route east and west to Montreal and Sault Ste. Marie. Much of the original signage is now gone, but a few signs remain on the routes, with one sign in Harrow on County Road 20. Until 1997, there were a few signs along former Highway 3 alignment near the Cottam and Essex areas. As the route is now mostly county road, signage has been maintained in some areas, removed in some and left to simply fade to illegibility in others. In some areas where the signed route is concurrent with other posted tourist routes, markers for newly designated routes have displaced the \\"Heritage Highway\\" wheel. One such example is Trenton where on Highways 2 and 33 the Heritage Highway and Loyalist Parkway run concurrently with other signed tourist routes including a former Apple Route (to Brighton), a segment of the Wine Route (to Picton) and the Hastings County Arts Route (through Belleville). Recent signage bears a white-on-brown wheel and the words \\"Heritage Highway - Route des Pionniers\\", the latter being a version of the French language translation of \\"Heritage Highways, Sur la Route des Pionniers\\" used in the original 1972 joint promotional effort with Qu√©bec.  Lake Nipissing Circle Tour  The Lake Nipissing Circle Tour is a tourist route that travels around Lake Nipissing. It follows Highway 11 from an intersection with former Highway 11B to the interchange with Highway 654 just south of Callander. It then follows Highway 534 to Carr, where it turns on to the short Highway 524. At the end of that highway, it follows Highway 522 to Highway 69. At Alban, it turns on to Highway 64, before turning on to Highway 17 near Sturgeon Falls and following it to North Bay. Once it meets the former Highway 17B, it turns down that road (Main Street), following it to the southern intersection with former Highway 11B.  Loyalist Parkway  Eastern terminus of Loyalist Parkway and Kingston Road 33 in Kingston A section of Highway 33 between Amherstview and Trenton was designated the Loyalist Parkway in 1984. This designation was made to honour the United Empire Loyalists, who first settled that area of Ontario. The official designation was presided over by Queen Elizabeth II, when she visited Kingston during Ontario's bicentennial celebrations. Highway 33 now ends at Bloomfield, and the Loyalist Parkway continues as Prince Edward County Road 33 toward Stirling.  Oil Heritage Route  The Oil Heritage Route travels along Lambton County Road 21, formerly Highway 21, from its interchange with Highway 402, through Wyoming, Petrolia, Oil City and Oil Springs. It then curves east then south to Dresden, meeting the African-Canadian Heritage Tour route. This route is still signed, Lambton CR 21's name north of Rutherford is \\"Oil Heritage Road\\".  Talbot Trail  Talbot Trail logo New sign standards being erected in Elgin County, Ontario bear this logo The Talbot Trail is an historically significant overland route completed in the 1820s along the north shore of Lake Erie. The building of the route of almost in length was overseen by Colonel Thomas Talbot. It was originally a corduroy road, eventually becoming Highway 3 and several numbered county roads. Its original intent was to provide a continuous land route for settlers and military personnel between the Niagara region and Detroit, aiding in the development of the Talbot Settlement. The route begins in Windsor and travels southeast and then east through Leamington, Wheatley, Blenheim and St. Thomas. East of Aylmer, it leaves Highway 3 and follows County Road 38 (Heritage Line) proceeding through the village of Straffordville. It continues to Courtland, where it rejoins Highway 3. The route proceeds east along Highway 3 through Delhi, Simcoe, Jarvis and Cayuga. At Dunnville, the route splits from Highway 3 and follows County Road 3 (Lakeshore Road) through the tiny communities of Stromness, Lowbanks, Long Beach and Camelot Beach, before rejoining Highway 3 near Wainfleet. It proceeds east along Highway 3, terminating at the Niagara River in Fort Erie. The actual 19th century settlement road began in Amherstburg and ended in Canborough, north of Dunnville, where existing settlement roads provided a route to Fort Erie and Niagara Falls.  Terry Fox Courage Highway  The Terry Fox Courage Highway was designated on July 30, 1981 in honour of Terry Fox, whose Marathon of Hope reached as far as Thunder Bay and who died a month prior. The route begins there and follows Highway 11 and Highway 17 for to Nipigon. It travels northeast along the shore of Lake Superior, and also forms part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. The route is well signed throughout its length.  Voyageur Route  The Voyageur Route crosses Ontario, starting at the Manitoba border on Highway 17. It passes through Kenora and continues to Highway 71. It turns south, following Highway 71 for its entire length to Highway 11 between Barwick and Emo. It follows Highway 11 to Shabaqua Corners, Ontario, where it rejoins Highway 17. From there, the route continues east through Thunder Bay, over Lake Superior and Lake Huron to Sudbury and onward to Arnprior. The route ends where Highway 17 transitions to Highway 417. This route may no longer be signed, particularly on parts east of Pembroke, Ontario and in Northwestern Ontario. The route also shares much of its routing with the Frontier Route, Great River Road, and Heritage Highway. The voyageurs were ordinary workman of the fur trade.  Welland Canal Route  The Welland Canal Route is designated along provincial highways and Regional Roads in Niagara Region along the Welland Canal. The trail starts at the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 406 interchange in St. Catharines, traveling south to Highway 58 in Thorold. The Welland Canal Route travels under the canal, following Highway 58 to the intersection of Highway 20, Niagara Regional Road 82 (Allanport Road), and Niagara Regional Road 20 (Canboro Road). The route turns onto Canboro Road, crossing back over the Canal towards Highway 406. It then turns south along Highway 406 to Main Street in Welland, where it turns east and passes beneath the canal again. It follows Highway 140 south to Highway 58A, which it follows beneath the canal for the final time. The route turns south at Highway 58 and travels south Niagara Regional Road 3, formerly part of nearby Highway 3 in Port Colborne.  Wine Route  Wine Route logo The Wine Route is signed in several different segments in Southern Ontario, ranging from Essex County, to the Niagara region, and to the northern shore of Lake Ontario. It is still signed to this day, and promoted in newspapers and other media. The Wine Route starts in Windsor, Ontario, and travels down Essex County Road 20, formerly Highway 18, through LaSalle, Ontario and Amherstburg, Ontario. It continues through Harrow, Ontario, before branching off to the ferry docks in Kingsville, Ontario, serving Pelee Island's Pelee Island Winery via a ferry crossing. The trail continues on Pelee Island, and along County Road 20 on the mainland; both meet in Leamington, Ontario at the intersection of Seacliffe Drive and Erie Street, formerly part of Highway 77. The wine route designation continues, unsigned, north to and along Highway 77 to Highway 401. From there it travels east to Highway 403 in Woodstock, Ontario, which it continues along to Hamilton, Ontario and the rest of the Niagara Peninsula. Through the Niagara Region, the route is designated as the Niagara Wine Route, and while well-signed, exists in the form of loops and spurs connecting the various wineries to the communities of the region.http://www.niagaraonthelake.com/Falldrives/ The trunk route follows Niagara Regional Road 81, formerly Highway 8 from Grimsby eastward, where in western St. Catharines it diverges into two primary routes. The first route travels north along Regional Road 34, then turns east, following the shore of Lake Ontario along Regional Road 89 and passing through Port Dalhousie and many of the wineries along the lakeshore. The other route passes along the edge of the Niagara Escarpment and through Niagara-on-the-Lake along Regional Roads 69, 100 and 55. A spur along Fourth Avenue and Ontario Street connects wineries in the west-end of the city and Downtown St. Catharines to the northern route, while another spur crosses through central Niagara-on-the-Lake and the community of Virgil, connecting both routes to the Niagara Parkway. The primary routes reconvene in the Olde Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake where Regional Roads 89 and 55 meet, not far from the mouth of the Niagara River. A wine route also exists along Highways 33, Highway 62 and Highway 49 in Prince Edward County.

He opposed the new religion spread by the Spaniards and fought against the subsequent conversion of the Boholanos to the Catholic faith. According to Legend, he challenged the Spanish priest, and when he won, he earned the trust of the people. He exhorted them free themselves from Spanish oppression, leading 2,000 followers in what was dubbed as the \\"Tamblot Uprising\\" or \\"Tamblot Revolt\\". Biography Little is known about Tamblot except that he was a tagalogenio of Barrio Tupas, in Antequera town who led a number of his pagan followers to wage a religious war against the Spaniards for fear that their Bathala would be replaced by the God of the Catholic religion.Ocon, Dodong. Abatan River: Its Beauty history www.boholchronicle.com Retrieved 28 November 2006. Tamblot Uprising According to Spanish accounts of Fr. Juan Medina (History of the Augustinian Order in the Filipinas Island, 1630) Tamblot gained followers when he and his priests showed 'miracles' around the surrounding villages. He would pierce bamboos poles with a small knife from which rice and wine would flow out of magically. . Another account by Fr. Murillo Velarde (Historia de Phelipinas, 1749) stated that Tamblot promised his disciples that weapons would bounce off their skin, bejuco vines would provide distilled wine, tree leaves would turn into saranga (fish) for food and banana leaves into linen for clothing. He promised them that once a shrine was created in the seclusion of the hills, that he and his followers would be able to lead a life full of bounty thanks to the miracles the diwata would provide. They would also be free from tax and church duties required of them by the Spanish authorities. He quickly gained followers many in turn went to other villages performing the same miracles and preaching his message as his priests. He preached that with his magic, the native gods ie diwatas would protect them from the Spanish weapons and they would be able to vanquish them from the island. He instructed his followers to gather much goods and rice in order to set up a bastion in the foothills expecting an impending attack. Four villages around the towns of Loboc and Baclayon defected to his movement. All in all, Tamblot supposedly built a shrine for the diwata surrounded by hundreds of huts of his followers deep in the mountains. His message spread far and wide around the Visayas region including Pintado and Leyte that roused the alarm of local priests in the city of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus. The priests encouraged the alcalde mayor of Cebu, Juan Alcarazo to take action against the Boholanos in order to stifle the spread of their movement. Alcarazo hesitated to act as he did not have permission from his superior the governor-general, Alonzo Fajardo. In some accounts, Alcarazo supposedly had sent messages to the rebels for them to lay down their arms which the Boholanos flatly refused. The priests were finally able to persuade him to act early to stamp out a full scale revolt that might spread throughout other islands. He assembled a small contingent of 50 Spanish and 1000 native troops, mostly Sialo warriors armed with swords and shields as well as Spanish firearms. An account by Aduarte added that the contingent consisted of Cebuanos as well as Kapampangan warriors with a Spanish priest, the total force numbering more than a 1000. Upon landing in Bohol using four caracoas, they started marching on New Year's Day of 1622 seeking out the mountain stronghold of Tamblot's followers. The journey took five days through steep terrain and swamps but finally reached their base. On the sixth day, conflict started with the rebels killing a native ally in a skirmish. The next day after that, an estimated 1500 strong force ambushed the Spanish vanguard defended by a 16 Spanish troops and 300 native allies. Spanish and Cebuano soldiers fired volleys of musket shot on the Boholanos killing many. Tamblot's men was forced to retreat to a bamboo thicket. The Spanish troops pursued them but were bogged down by a sudden heavy rainfall. As heavy rain started to pour it briefly slowed down their rate of their fire giving a momentary time lapse for Tamblot's men to counter. Tamblot and his priests encouraged their followers to attack head on stating that the rain was a miracle from the diwatas. Fortunately for the Spanish forces, the shields of the Cebuanos were able to keep the guns dry enough from the rain continuing massive damage against the Boholano counterattack. The continued volley of fire mowed down charging Boholano zealots enough to rout them. Most were sent fleeing further into the mountains. The Spanish troops then seized upon the stronghold, with a manned stone redoubt from where the natives hurled stones and clods of earth/mud. During the battle, Alcarazo was supposedly hit and knocked out momentarily with a rock thrown by the enemy. He recovered thanks to the protection of his helmet and quickly rallied his troops. The troops raised their shields as they were pelted by stones, and eventually were able to gain access to the redoubt. Slaughter of the defenders ensued. The base was pillaged; booty of food, gold, silver and bells were collected. For four more days the Spanish troops pursued the many who fled, either killing them or finding them dead of hunger. The Spanish colonial troops dispersed or killed the remaining of Tamblot's followers. Some of the leaders were hanged and the rest were given amnesty. Some of those they captured were sentenced to enslavement of 10 years. The troops returned to Loboc. Alcarazo left a contingent of native troops and within weeks arrived back at Cebu victorious. Six months later, another group of rebels reformed and set another base on the peak of another mountain. Alcarazo again returned to Bohol with more troops. After a vicious uphill campaign, wherein the attacking force was harassed by defenders as they slowly raced up the steep mountain stronghold incurring much losses, the Spanish forces were able to reach top. After a fierce battle, the defenders were overpowered again by musket fire. The natives were either routed and fled, or killed outright ending the revolt. Alcarazo was given commendation. Part of the war booty he collected was awarded to him by the governor for his swift actions in Bohol. Legacy Tamblot's movement and uprising influenced other leaders who had contempt of the Spanish overlordship to rebel. One such revolt was Bancao's revolt in Leyte which also occurred in 1622 and was also put down by Alcarazo. The Tamblot uprising was one of two significant revolts that occurred in Bohol during the Spanish Era. The other one was the Dagohoy Rebellion, considered as the longest rebellion in Philippine history. This rebellion was led by Francisco Dagohoy, also known as Francisco Sendrijas, from 1744 to 1829.Readings From Bohol's History www.aenet.org, Source: Philippine Political and Cultural History.

He gave his name to a city of the same name, Cyzicus, his capital.  Family  Cyzicus's parentage is given as AeneusApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica Book 1.949Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica Book 3.1Parthenius, Love Romances 28.1 by Aenete (or Aenippe), daughter of Eusorus; or else Eusorus is given as his father.Hyginus, Fabulae 16 King Cyzicus is sometimes referred to as a Thessalian migrant (hence his hospitality to the Argonauts, many of whom hailed from Thessaly, including Jason himself). The name Aeneus recalls the Thracian city of Aenus, although Aeneus is said to be the son of Apollo and Stilbe, a daughter of the Thessalian River Peneus.Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1.948 His wife was Cleite, daughter of Merops of Percote, others say that she was Larissa, daughter of Piasus.  Mythology  After the departure of the Argonauts in Lemnos, they landed in the island of the DolionesAs to the visit of the Argonauts to the Doliones and the death of King Cyzicus, see Ap. Rhod., Argon. i.935-1077; Orphica, Argonautica 486ff.; Valerius Flaccus, Argon. ii.634ff., iii.1ff.; Hyginus, Fab. 16. of whom Cyzicus was the king. He welcomed the Argonauts on their journey to Colchis and received them with generous hospitality. But after their departure, a storm drove them back to the Cyzicene coast at night. With neither the Argonauts nor King Cyzicus recognizing one another, each mistook the other as an enemy and battle ensued. The Doliones thought they were Pelasgian army who constantly harassed them. : \\"The enemy have seized the harbour, our hold foes the Pelasgians have returned!‚Äù Men‚Äôs rest was broken; the god Pan had driven the doubting city distraught, Pan fulfilling the cruel commands of the Mygdonian Mother [i.e. Cybele], Pan lord of the woodlands and of war, whom from the daylight hours caverns shelter; about midnight in lonely places are seen that hairy flank and the soughing leafage on his fierce brow.\\" The Argonauts slew many of the Dolionians, among the rest was King Cyzicus who was himself killed either by Jason or Heracles. The incident had been arranged by the gods Cybele, Pan (god) and Bellona (goddess) because Cybele wanted revenge against the king for killing one of her lions. Valerius Flaccus recounts this account in the following passage: : \\"As Cyzicus upon his swift horse shook Dindymus where votaries revel with bloodstained arms, and wearied the woods, he was betrayed by his too great love of the chase; for with his javelin he slew a lion that was wont to bear its mistress [i.e. Cybele] through the cities of Phrygia and was now returning to the bridle. And now (Madman!) hath he hung from his doorposts the mane and the head of his victim, a spoil to bring sorrow to himself and shame upon the goddess. But she, nursing her great rage, beholds from the cymbal-clashing mountain the ship with its border of kingly shields, and devises against the hero deaths and horrors unheard of: how in the night to set allied hands at strife in unnatural war, how to enmesh the city in cruel error. When day broke, the Argonauts realized their tragic mistake, and granted Cyzicus an elaborate burial.Dinter, Martin. \\"Epic from Epigram:The Poetics of Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica .\\" American Journal of Philology.

The mound was to be seen down to later days, and the people of Cyzicus continued to pour libations at it every year.\\" After the burial, the Argonauts handed over the kingdom to Cyzicus' sons, then sailed away and touched at Mysia. King Cyzicus left behind his young bride Cleite who hung herself after her husband's tragic death.

In 2014, Mosj√∏en Airport had 61,480 passengers. It is owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor. Service The airport is served by Wider√∏e with Dash 8 aircraft connecting the community to the nearby towns of Bod√∏ and Trondheim. The routes are operated on public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The runway is too short for flights with enough fuel to reach Oslo. History The airport was opened in 1987 as part of the last group of regional airports to be built in Norway. In 2002, the Ministry of Transport launched an idea of merging the three airports serving Northern Helgeland: Mosj√∏en Airport, Sandnessj√∏en Airport, and Mo i Rana Airport into one new airport with a large enough runway to fly Airbus A320/Boeing 737 aircraft directly to Oslo, and make it unnecessary to operate subsidized regional aircraft to Helgeland. The Korgfjell Tunnel opened in 2005 created a reliable and fast road between Mosj√∏en and Mo i Rana. A better road to Sandnessj√∏en (Toven Tunnel) was opened 2014. A location was selected at Drevjadalen in Vefsn, about north of Mosj√∏en, which is from Sandnessj√∏en and from Mo i Rana. Meteorological tests performed by Avinor showed however that the area had too much fog to serve as an airport. As of 2007, the idea of a new airport at this location is abandoned by both Avinor and the Ministry of Transport. Instead of this plan, a decision was made in 2013 to build a larger airport near Mo i Rana Airport, R√∏ssvoll.

The river has its sources in the hills of the Northern Pennines, and is formed by the confluence of the East and West Allen rivers. The Allen is itself, a tributary of the River Tyne. The Allen was formerly very polluted from mining activity upstream, but remediation schemes have been implemented to allow the water quality to improve. The river is home to a variety of wildlife including voles and otters. History The Allen, which is long, is a tributary of the River South Tyne. Whilst the derivation of the river name itself is unknown, it gives its name to Allendale and Allenheads. The river is classed as the Allen from a place called Water Meetings, which is just south of Cupola Bridge, a grade II listed structure built in 1778. Upstream of there, the water is formed by the River West Allen and the River East Allen, which are and respectively. Allen Valley Angling and Conservation provides permits to fish the River East Allen and supports conservation efforts to improve fish stock and riverside access. The river is home to wild brown trout and visiting spawning sea trout, salmon and otters. Conservation work in 2010 including the removal of weirs that were no longer necessary and the introduction of fish passes to allow the fish further upstream than has been possible since Victorian times. In 2017, voles were released in the upper catchment. The riverside is noted for its broadleaved woodland and walks through the gorges and valleys that the river flows through. Allen Banks and Staward Gorge is upstream on this river from the confluence with the Tyne. The gorge is evidence of ice streams escaping during the Devensian period, which carved their way through the limestone. During the winter of 2015/2016, Storm Desmond affected the river with severe flooding, which led to the woodland alongside the river being closed to the public. However, this in turn meant that more wildlife was noted around the river, including red squirrels, roe deer and more otters. The river has been subjected to pollution from mining activity in the Northern Pennine Orefield; both rivers have had mining activity close to them, with Allen Smelt Mill being located on the south bank of the East Allen. However, further downstream on the River Tyne, the metalliferous pollution has promoted certain types of grasses to grow which thrive on lead and zinc ores in the water. Catchment and hydrometry The main river drains an area of , but with the addition of the West and East Allen rivers, the total area is . The water quality ranges from moderate to poor on account of previous mining activity. Due to the amount of water that can be drained into the river, the steep nature of the valley walls and the \\"impervious geology\\" of the underlying rock, the river is noted to be a problem for flash flooding, which can lead to inundation problems downstream. Whilst there no gauging stations on the River Allen, there is one on the East Allen near Allendale. The normal range for the river there is between and in normal weather conditions. The highest level recorded was in November 2000, when the peak flow was measured at .

The competition is consisted of local and regional qualifiers and the world championship, the FIRST Championship, and in every season, a kickoff is held to showcase the season's theme and game. After kickoff, robots are designed, built, and programmed by teams, and teams are encouraged to conduct outreach with their communities. Local qualifiers are held for teams to compete and qualify for regional qualifiers, and from that point, regional qualifiers are held for teams to qualify for the world championship. FIRST Tech Challenge is the one of the four major robotics programs organized by FIRST, which its other three programs include FIRST Lego League Explore, FIRST Lego League Challenge, and FIRST Robotics Competition. The robot kit is Android-based, and it is programmed using Java, the Blocks programming interface, or other Android programming systems. Teams, with the guidance of coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on innovative, sound engineering principles. Awards are given for robot performance as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments. History The FIRST Tech Challenge grew out of the existing FIRST Robotics Competition and the IFI Robovation platform. FIRST, RadioShack, and Innovation First collaborated to develop an improved version of the IFI Robovation kit. The kit was significantly upgraded and called the VEX Robotics Design System. In 2004‚Äì05, FIRST piloted the FIRST Vex Challenge as a potential program. The pilot season brought together over 130 teams to compete in 6 regional tournaments in a 1/3 scale FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar. Fifty teams participated in the FVC tournament at the FIRST Championship in April, 2006. On April 29, 2006, the FIRST Board of Directors voted to extend FVC for the 2006‚Äì2007 season. In Summer 2007, after two seasons as the FIRST Vex Challenge, FIRST announced that the program would be renamed the FIRST Tech Challenge. For the 2008 season, Pitsco developed a platform that uses the NXT brick along with additional hardware and a new structural framework under the new name of TETRIX. Then, in the 2015-2016 FTC season, the NXT bricks that were used previously as the robot controller were replaced by Android phones running Android KitKat (4.4) using Qualcomm Snapdragon (410) chips. In 2020, FTC replaced the Android phones with a Rev Robotics Control Hub and kept one of the phones to use for a wireless connection between one and two Logitech or Xbox(Windows compatible) controllers and the control hub. The FTC championship was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic. Competition Robot of team 8275, the Tech Busters, for the 2015-2016 FIRST Res-Q challenge Advancement from one level of competition to another in FIRST Tech Challenge can be achieved by either winning on the field (50%) or by winning the awards listed below during judging (50%). Judging at competitions is done through a multitude of ways such as team presentations, pit interviews, judges reading teams' engineering notebooks, etc. Schedule Every year, in September, FIRST announces the game challenge to FTC teams at Kickoff. Qualifying Tournaments and Regional & State Championships occur from October through March. Teams are allowed to register for three Qualifying Tournaments. Some states, such as New Jersey, hold league meets that are more similar to sporting events. They are smaller and occur more often. For teams advancing from the United States, from the 2013-14 through the 2017‚Äì18, four Super-Regional Championship Tournaments have been held from March through early April, with the World Championships occurring in late April. Starting with the 2018-19 FTC season, the Super Regional Championships will no longer occur and teams will advance from their local championships directly to one of the two World Championships in Houston or Detroit. Matches On competition days, the number of matches varies based on the number of teams competing. Matches are completely random in their order and alliances. For the matches, teams are assigned to either red alliance or blue alliance, with each alliance consisting of two teams. All parties involved in the match must choose their programs before the match begins. Drivers must not touch the gamepad controllers during the first 30 seconds of the match, also known as the autonomous period. Then, the 2 minute driver controlled period starts and the match is completely driver-controlled from then on. In the final 30 seconds of the match, drivers attempt to park in a point scoring zone and/or complete tasks that can only be done in the end game period of the match. The winning alliance receives two qualifying points while the losing alliance receives zero.  Judging  Besides matches, teams can advance through awards, which the judges give at the end of competition day. Teams are required to submit an engineering notebook in order to be considered for some awards such as Inspire Award, Think Award, and so on. Before matches begin, teams are required to do a formal interview with the judges. Throughout the day, judges can observe the matches and conduct pit interviews with teams. After the end of matches, judges deliberate and discuss about the awards, and at the awards ceremony, judges present the awards. Winner and finalist teams with awards such as the Inspire Award can advance depending on the number of allowed advancements by the qualifier. Gracious Professionalism The core value that FIRST Tech Challenge promotes is embodied in the phrase \\"Gracious Professionalism.\\" Showing gracious professionalism can be done in many ways, from helping another team, to simply having fun at competitions. The definition of this phrase is completely up to the person which is why it is one of the most important aspects of FTC. Events Official FTC events are Qualifying or Championship Tournaments; unofficial events are Scrimmage Tournaments. Based on their performance in their Regional/State Championships (US) teams are invited to one of the World Championship based on predetermined advancement criteria. Winners of Qualifying Tournaments are invited to Championship Tournaments and until 2017-18 winners of Championship tournaments were then invited to Super-Regional Tournaments. After the winning alliances of the two championships are declared, they are invited to participate in the Festival of Champions in Manchester, New Hampshire to determine the FTC World Champion. On January 10, 2018, FTC announced that Super-Regionals will be abolished after the 2017‚Äì2018 season. Due to this, the number of FTC teams that attend each World Championship will be increased from 128 to 160 starting in 2019. Teams advance from one level of competition to the next based on the advancement criteria laid out in the first part of that year's Game Manual. The Advancement criteria was changed for the 2015‚Äì2016 season to add criteria 7 \\"Winning Alliance, 2nd Team selected\\" and 13 \\"Finalist Alliance, 2nd Team selected,\\" shifting the successive criteria down one position. Awards In addition to the Winning and Finalist Alliances receiving recognition for their field performance; the following list includes awards presented at official Championship and Qualifying Tournaments based on judging criterion including engineering notebook, team interview, observation, and/or field performance: *Inspire Award: This award is generally given to teams who achieve greatness in all parts of FIRST including programming, robot design, the engineering notebook, judging presentations, gracious professionalism, and outreach. This team embodies what it is to be a FIRST robotics team and is a team that others can look up to as a role model. The Inspire Award is the highest ranked award as it embodies all other awards inside of it and allows a direct bid to the next level of competition. *Think Award: The winning team of this award clearly displays their engineering and design process in their engineering notebook. This award honors the team who had an engineering section of their engineering notebook that clearly displayed the mathematics, science, and design process that went into the building of their robot. *Connect Award: This award is granted to the team that most connects to their engineering community outside of FIRST by sharing who they are, what FIRST is, and how others can become involved. On top of that, this team's engineering notebook shows that they have a clear fundraising, business, and outreach plan that they will follow throughout the season. *Rockwell Collins Innovate Award: This award is given to the team with the most innovative and creative robot design. This robot must work in a consistent manner but does not need to perform well in every round to be eligible for this award. *Design Award: This award focuses on the design aspect of the robot. The team winning this award must show a thoughtful design on their robot that is both functional and aesthetic. The robot must distinguish itself from other competitors by showing off its unique design. This design can be shown both on the competition field and in the engineering notebook through sketches, blueprints, photos, and computer- aided design (CAD). CAD helps teams plan and create robots before actually building the robot in person. *Motivate Award: The winning team of this award exemplifies what it means to be a FIRST team. This team works together by showing gracious professionalism at competitions and by recruiting and assisting other teams and members at home. *Control Award: This programming centered award commends the team that had the best use of unique programs and successful sensors used in their rounds. This team's engineering notebook must have had a very detailed in explaining their implementation of software, sensors, and mechanical control.

Function  This image shows the structures of Cap32/34 superposed onto CapZ (in green) over the CŒ± positions of the entire CP molecules. In molecular biology CapZ, also known as CAPZ; CAZ1 and CAPPA1, is a protein composed of alpha and beta subunits. Its main function is to cap the barbed (plus) end of actin filaments in muscle cells. It is located in the Z band of the muscle sarcomere. This protein helps to stabilize the actin filaments protecting it from assembly and disassembly. The activity regulation of this protein can be done by other regulatory proteins that bind to the actin filaments blocking the CapZ, hence allowing assembly. CapZ is also known to play a role in cell signaling, as it regulates PKC activity in cardiac cells.  Regulation  Experimentation on chicken muscles have indicated that there are certain proteins that inhibit CapZ from binding. This includes PIP2 and other phosphoplipids. These molecules bind to CapZ itself to prevent it from binding to actin. However, introduction of certain detergents (in this case Triton X 100) prevent the binding of these molecules to CapZ; in turn allowing it to bind to the microfilament. Competition for actin binding sites can also regulate CapZ binding, as seen with filament elongation factors. These factors include ENA/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein). CapZ is not regulated by calcium or calmodulin, as seen with other capping proteins, such as Gelsolin.  Cell movement  CapZ also plays a role in cell movement (cell crawling) by controlling the lengths of the microfilaments. When CapZ is inhibited by regulating factors, microfilament polymerization or depolymerization occurs allowing lamellipodia and filopodia to grow out or retract. This polymerization and depolymerization gives the cell the appearance of crawling. When CapZ binds, it halts both of these processes.  Structure  CapZ is a heterodimeric molecule, made up of an Œ± and Œ≤ subunit. The Œ± and Œ≤ subunits are similar in structure. Each subunit is divided into three domains and a shared C-terminal extension. Helix 1-3 is an N-terminal that is composed of three antiparallel helices that are arranged in an up, down, up pattern. Helix 4 is a C-terminal made up of an antiparallel Œ≤ sheet which is composed of five Œ≤ strands. On one side of the C-terminal, there is a shorter N-terminal helix and a long C-terminal helix. This long C-terminal helix makes up helix 5. The final helix, helix 6 differs in the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits. The Œ≤ subunit is longer than the Œ± subunit.  Cardiac health  A modest reduction in cardiac CapZ protein protects hearts against acute ischemia-reperfusion injury.

B. Winter State Park (also known as Raymond B. Winter State Park) is a Pennsylvania state park on in Hartley Township, Union County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is in the ridge and valley region of Pennsylvania and is surrounded by Bald Eagle State Forest. R. B. Winter State Park is in a shallow basin that is surrounded by ridges. Halfway Lake is the central recreational focus of the park. The park is west of Lewisburg on Pennsylvania Route 192. The park was originally called \\"Halfway Dam State Park\\", but was renamed \\"R.B. Winter State Park\\" on May 23, 1957 to honor state forester Raymond Burrows Winter, who was instrumental in establishing the park and had worked there and the surrounding state forest for 45 years. Rapid Run Natural Area Rapid Run Natural Area The first settlers in the area found a very dense forest that was according to Conrad Weiser, \\"so thick that for a mile at a time we could not find the place the size of a hand, where the sun could penetrate, even in the clearest day...\\" Some examples of this dense forest still stand today at R. B. Winter State Park. The Rapid Run Natural Area is of land set aside \\"to provide a location for scientific observation of natural systems, to protect an example of a typical and unique plant and animal community, and to protect and outstanding example of natural interest and beauty.\\" This natural area has been largely untouched since it was last logged for timber in 1850. Pileated woodpeckers can be seen in this area. Barred owls also live in the Rapid Run Natural Area. Vernal pools fill each spring to provide water for fairy shrimp, caddis-flies, spotted salamanders, and wood frogs. Halfway Lake Halfway Lake is filled by spring fed mountain streams. It is contained by a hand-laid native sandstone dam, the first cement and stone dam ever built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The temperature of the water in Halfway Lake is always about . This is because much of the lake is filled with water that comes from directly underground. Little Bubbler is an artesian spring that seeps up through the sand on the west end of the beach at R. B. Winter State Park. Swimming is permitted but lifeguards are not provided as of 2008. Halfway Lake is a cold water fishery that is stocked with brook, brown and rainbow trout. Ice fishing is permitted when the lake is frozen and the ice is at least thick. Recreation Camping People interested in staying overnight at R. B. Winter State park have three options. They can stay at one of the 59 modern camp sites some of which are equipped with electricity. All the sites have access to modern restrooms with showers. Each camp site also has its own fire ring, picnic table and lantern holder. There are three cottages that sleep up to five people. The cottages have electric lights and a small baseboard heater as well as wooden floors, windows, skylights, porches, a picnic table and fire ring. There is one modern cabin that is available to rent year-round. It is two stories with a furnished living area, kitchen, one- and-a-half baths, four bedrooms and two porches. Trails The CCC-built dam in the park R. B. Winter State Park has of hiking trails that meander around the park and along the lakeshore. The park is also a trailhead for the hiking, mountain biking and snow mobile trails in Bald Eagle State Forest. Most of the trails in the park are open to mountain biking except for Rapid Run Trail and Mid State Trail and part of Overlook Trail. R. B. Winter State Park is open to cross-country skiing and snowmobiling during the winter months. Hunting Hunting is permitted on of R.B. Winter State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, American black bear, white-tailed deer, and woodcocks. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.

Sybase acquired Expressway and re-introduced the product in 1995 as IQ Accelerator, then renamed it shortly thereafter to Sybase IQ, giving it version number 11.0. By offering the IQ product as part of a collection of related technologies often found in a data warehouse (including Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise, Replication Server, PowerDesigner PowerDesigner, and SQL Anywhere), Sybase became one of the first mainstream companies to acknowledge the need for specialized products for the data warehouse market. With version 12.0, Sybase replaced the loosely coupled query interface from Adaptive Server Enterprise with a tight coupling with SQL Anywhere. Version 16 brings a re- engineered column store for extreme, petabyte scale, data volumes, and more extreme data compression. In 2014, SAP HANA, together with partners BMMsoft, HP, Intel, NetApp, and Red Hat announced the world's largest data warehouse. A team of engineers from SAP, BMMsoft, HP, Intel, NetApp, and Red Hat, built the data warehouse using SAP HANA and SAP IQ 16, with BMMsoft Federated EDMT running on HP DL580 servers using Intel Xeon E7-4870 processors under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and NetApp FAS6290 and E5460 storage. The development and testing of the 12.1PB data warehouse was conducted by the SAP/Intel Petascale lab in Santa Clara, Calif., and audited by InfoSizing, an independent Transaction Processing Council certified auditor. Version history With the release of SP08, the version numbers have been changed to align with and match SAP HANA's version numbers to reflect the product's continuous integration with SAP HANA. The actual release title SP03 is a follow-on to SP02, covering all platforms not affected by the release. In-memory data fabric SAP's new approach streamlines and simplifies Data Warehousing into an In-Memory Data Fabric.http://www.sap.com/pc/tech/data-warehousing.html SAP's In-Memory Data Fabric Architecture SAP IQ with SAP HANA With the advent of big data, SAP IQ has coupled with SAP HANA to deliver a distributed in-memory analytics platform. There are three main applications and use cases which try to capitalize on SAP IQ's strengths concerning scalability and performance as an EDW and big data processor, while leveraging SAP HANA's in- memory speed for operational reporting: SAP IQ as a Near-line Service (NLS) to SAP HANA https://blogs.sap.com/2016/10/12/sap-nls-solution-sap-bw SAP HANA for operational reporting with SAP IQ for big data processing (NLS) In this scenario, SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data goes into SAP HANA which acts as an operational data store for immediate analysis. Once the data is analyzed it is integrated into SAP IQ via Near-line storage mechanisms (as described above). Here SAP IQ acts as an enterprise data warehouse that receives data from a variety of traditional sources (such as OLTP Databases and files systems), and SAP HANA Operational Data Store(ODS) https://blogs.sap.com/2019/05/22/q-the-easy-installer-for-sap-iq/ SAP IQ as an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) with SAP HANA as Agile Data Mart When SAP IQ is used as an EDW, it can also be augmented with HANA's in-memory technology. Common uses include planning and analysis reports where simultaneous OLTP processing is needed. In this case, data flows from SAP IQ to SAP HANA. SAP BusinessObjects BI can be used to achieve visibility across both platforms. Technology SAP IQ 16 Engine To a user, SAP IQ looks just like any relational DBMS with a SQL-based language layer accessible via ODBC/JDBC drivers. However, inside, Sybase IQ is a column-oriented DBMS, which stores data tables as sections of columns of data rather than as rows of data like most transactional databases. Column-Store Architecture Column- orientation has a number of advantages. If a search is being done for items matching a particular value in a column of data, only the storage objects corresponding to that data column within the table need to be accessed. A traditional row-based database would have to read the whole table, top to bottom. Another advantage is that when indexed correctly, a value that would have to be stored once in each row of data in a traditional database is stored only once, and in SAP IQ, an n-bitindex is used to access the data.Sybase IQ#cite note-Moore-1 Nbit and tiered indexing is used to allow for increased compression and fast, incremental batch loads. Additionally, the column-based storage enables SAP IQ to compress data efficiently on the fly.http://www.sap.com/bin/sapcom/en_us/downloadasset.2013-09-sep-23-13.achieving- analytics-that-are-both-cost-effective-and-optimized-for-performance-pdf.html File:Column store.png|SAP IQ Column Store Indexing Technology Prior to SAP IQ 16, each data page was structured as an array of cells of a fixed size, so all values have the same data type. While this storage approach is efficient for structured and fixed length data, this does not hold for the more unstructured and variable sized data that is seen today. To combat storage inefficiency and store variable sized data with minimal wasted space, each page is composed of cells of a variable size that are packed tightly together; the column store architecture supports a variable number of cells per page and various page formats within a column. SAP IQ also applies Lempel- Ziv-Welch ( LZW ) compression algorithmshttp://blasthemy.com/sap/TechEd13/1_Session_PDFs/RDP/RDP107/RDP107.pdf to each data page when it is written to disk, to significantly reduce data volume. Bitmaps are used for secondary indexes. IQ Indexing.png|SAP IQ Indexing Massively Parallel Processing Framework SAP IQ has a massively parallel processing (MPP) framework based on a shared-everything environment that supports distributed query processing. Most other products capable of MPP tend to be based on shared-nothing environments. The benefit of shared- everything is that it's more flexible in terms of the variety of queries that can be optimized‚Äîespecially for balancing the needs of many concurrent users. The downside is that in extreme cases, competition among processors to access a shared pool of storage (usually a storage-area network), can lead to I/O contention, which affects query performance.[12] However, the aforementioned storage architecture of SAP IQ allows compute and storage layers to scale out independently of each other and also allows these resources to be provisioned on-demand for better utilization without restructuring the underlying database. Multiplex Architecture SAP IQ uses a clustered grid architecture, which is made up of clusters of SAP IQ servers, or Multiplex. These clusters are used to scale performance for large numbers of concurrent queries or queries that are great in complexity. This is built upon a shared- everything architecture where all compute nodes interact with the same shared storage and queries have the ability to distribute across all compute nodes. The Multiplex has a coordinator node which manages the database catalog and coordinates transactional writes to the store. Other nodes can be reader only nodes, or readers and writes, like the coordinator node. The storage fabric can be implemented with numerous technologies that allow sharing amongst the multiplex nodes. This architecture has multiple uses, including workload balancing and elastic virtual data marts. Workload balancing is achieved by the SAP IQ query engine through dynamically increasing/decreasing parallelism in response to changes in server activity. There is automatic failover if a node stops participating in a query, and other nodes will pick up work originally assigned to the failed node so the query can complete. On the client side, compatibility with external load balances ensures that queries are initiated on physical servers in a balanced fashion to eliminate bottlenecks. Physical nodes in the Multiplex can be grouped together into ‚Äúlogical servers‚Äù which allow workloads to be isolated from each other (for security or resource balancing purposes); machines can be added to these as demand changes. The aim of the grid architecture is to enable resiliency even during global transactions. Multiplex Architecture.png|SAP IQ Multiplex Architecture Multiplex2.png|SAP IQ Multiplex Use Case Loading Engine The SAP IQ Loading Engine can be used for incremental batch, low latency, concurrent loading, and bulk loading (with both client and server data files). The bulk loading process allows for multiple load process to occur simultaneously, if the loads are of different tables. Data can be loaded from other databases as well as files. Page-level snapshot versioning allows concurrent loads and queries, with locking occurring at the table level only. With SAP Replication Server, now enhanced to optimize loads into SAP IQ, transactions are compiled into the fewest set of operations, and then bulk micro-batch loads into SAP IQ are performed, which gives the appearance of real-time, continuous loads. The bulk loader now performs all operations in parallel to make full use of all server cores, remove bottlenecks, and keep all threads productive, instead of serializing the process. The loading process remains a two-phase process, first reading raw data and creating FP indexes, and second creating secondary indexes, but everything is executed in parallel. High Group indexes, which the query optimizer relies on for information about which columns/rows contain which data values, are now structured as a set of tiers, increasing as you move down the pyramid. Lastly, SAP IQ introduces a write-optimized, Row Level Versioned (RLV) Delta store which enables high-velocity data loads and fast availability of data to users. This store is minimally indexes and compressed, with row-level locking for concurrent write, and its own transaction log and is append only, and acts as a companion to the main store, with data being loaded at high speed to the RLV store, and migrating to the main store later, merging to it periodically. To the user it does not appear as though there are two separate entities at work and queries operate transparently across the two stores. To make use of this the users can specify particular ‚Äúhot‚Äù database tables as RLV tables. Loading Engine.png|SAP IQ Loading Engine Framework and Client APIs SAP IQ offers query APIs based on pure ANSI SQL standards (with few restrictions), that include OLAP and full-text search support. Stored procedures are supported in both ANSI SQL and Transact-SQL dialects, and can be executed on a scheduled or immediate basis. As well there are database drivers for a variety of programming languages such as JAVA, C/C++m PHP, PERL, Python, Ruby, and ADO.Net. Handling of Unstructured Data SAP IQ is an analytics engine that can query both structured and unstructured data and join the results together. SAP IQ introduced a new text index and an SQL ‚Äúcontains‚Äù clause to facilitate this by searching for terms within a blob of unstructured text; SAP Sybase's partnerships with vendors allow for various binary forms of text files to be ingested into SAP IQ and text indexes created for them; these text indexes get the data ready for higher level text analysis applications to perform full-text searches within SAP IQ via SELECT statements. SELECT syntax can be used by applications performing tokenization, categorization and further text analysis. In-Database Analytics / Extensibility Framework In-database analytics are built upon the fundamental concept of keeping analytics algorithms close to the data for higher performance. The extensibility framework, called ‚Äúin-database analytics‚Äù enables embedding of analytic functions inside the database engine of SAP IQ, moving analytics into the database, instead of to a specialized environment out of the database, a process which is error prone and slower. Pre-built functions are available natively and via partners of SAP IQ providing specialized statistical and data mining libraries that plug into SAP IQ. This framework increases SAP IQ's power to do advance processing and analysis as the data does not have to be moved out of the database into a specialized environment for analytics. All data and results obtained can be shared though the DBMS and can be easily acquired through an SQL interface. Through user defined functions (UDFS) partners can extend the DBMS with custom computations, by providing a specialized statistical and data mining libraries that plug right into SAP IQ to enhance its performance of advanced processing and analysis. Security SAP IQ provides several features, both included in the base product and licensable separately, to help protect the security of the user's data. A new feature introduced in IQ 16 is the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) which enables for a separation of duties and upholds the principle of least privilege, by allowing the breakdown of privileged operations into fine- grained sets that can be individually granted to users. Included as part of the base product are: users, groups and permissions, database administration authorities, user login policies, database encryption, transport-layer security, IPV6, role-based access control, and database auditing. Additional features are part of a licensable option called the advanced security option: FIPS encryption, Kerberos authentication, LDAP authentication, and Database column encryption. IQ Security.png|SAP IQ Security Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) As part of ILM, SAP IQ allows users to create multiple user DBSpaces (logical units of storage/containers for database objects) for organizing data. This can be used to separate structured or unstructured data, group it together according to age and value, or to partition table data. DBSpaces can also be marked as read-only to enable one-time consistency checking and back-up. Another application of ILM is the ability to partition tables, and place moving portions along the storage fabric and backup capabilities; this enables a storage management process where data cycles through tiered storage, moving from faster more expensive storage to slower, cheaper storage as it ages, partitioning data according to value. High availability and Disaster Recovery The multiplex set-up provides scalability and High Availability for compute nodes because a multiplex coordinator node can failover to an alternate coordinator node. The SAP IQ Virtual Backup also allows users to quickly backup data, and along with storage replication technology, data is continuously copied so backups can occur quickly and ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù. Once virtual backups are completed they can be verified through test and restore; enterprise data can be copied for development and testing. Then all that's left is to complete the backup at a transactionally consistent point in time. SAP claims that disaster recovery is easier with a shared everything approach to MPP. The SAP Sybase PowerDesigner modelling tool enables users to build an ILM model that can be deployed with SAP IQ. Storage types, DBSpaces, and lifecycle phases can be defined in an ILM model and the tool can be used to generate reports and create partition creation and movement scripts. Hadoop Integration SAP IQ provides federation with the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), a very popular framework for big data, so that enterprise users can continue to store data in Hadoop and utilize its benefits. Integration is achieved in four different ways, depending on the user's needs, through client-side federation, ETL, data, and query federation. Client-side federation joins data from IQ and Hadoop at a client application level while ETL federation lets the user load Hadoop data into the column store schemas of IQ. HDFS data can also be joined with IQ data on the fly through SQL queries from IQ, and finally results of MapReduce jobs can be combined with IQ data, also on the fly. SAP Control Center SAP Control Center replaces Sybase Central as a Web-Based graphical tool for administration and monitoring. SAP Control Center can be used for monitoring SAP Sybase servers and resources (node, multiplex) from any location, as well as monitoring performance, and spotting usage trends, The web application has a multi-tiered plug-in architecture which is made up of a server and product-based agents that bring SAP Sybase performance back to the Control Center Server. Web-Enabled Analytics SAP IQ comes with web- enabled application drivers facilitating access to SAP IQ from a variety of Web 2.0 programming and execution environments (Python, Perl, PHP, .Net, Ruby). Through query federation with other databases, developers can build applications that interact with multiple data sources at the same time (as well as with database platforms from other vendors). Federation proxy tables that map to tables in external databases can be created; these are materialized as in-memory tables but that can be interacted with as though they resided within SAP IQ. This way data sources can be combined in a unified view. Supported Platforms SAP IQ also supports plugging in external algorithms written in C++ and Java. SQL queries can call these algorithms, allowing for the execution of in-database analytics, which provides better performance and scalability. Additionally, Sybase IQ also provides drivers for access via languages such as PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby on Rails. SAP IQ supports most major operating system platforms, including: *Sun Solaris 64 bit *Red Hat Linux 64/32 bit *SuSE Linux 64/32 bit *HP-UX 64 bit *HP-UX Itanium 64 bit *IBM-AIX 64 bit *Windows 64/32 bit Customers Sybase claims that Sybase IQ is currently installed in over 2000 customer sites. Notable customers include comScore Inc., CoreLogic, Investment Technology Group (ITG), and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While Sybase IQ has been widely used for focused, data-mart-style deployments, it has also been deployed as an enterprise data warehouse.

He created and systematically developed liquid crystal materials science, and established a method of practical molecular design. Gray was recipient of the 1995 Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology. Education and career Born in Denny, Scotland, Gray was educated at the University of Glasgow and while working as an assistant lecturer at the University College in Hull (then part of the University of London) obtained his PhD in 1953. He developed his academic career at the college, which became the University of Hull in 1954, from 1946 to 1990. He was appointed senior lecturer in 1960, Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1974, and GF Grant Professor of Chemistry in 1984. He remained an Emeritus Professor at Hull. In 1990 he joined the chemical company Merck, then became an independent consultant in 1996. Liquid crystals In 1973, in conjunction with the Royal Radar Establishment, he showed that 4-Cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl possessed a stable nematic phase at room temperature. This compound and other long-lasting cyano-biphenyls made the twisted nematic display (LCD) popular. Gray wrote the first English book covering the subject of liquid crystals, \\"Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals\\", published in 1962. Gray was recipient of the 1995 Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1991. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1983, and in 1987 was awarded the Leverhulme Medal of the Royal Society. In 1979 he was awarded the Rank Prize for Opto- electronics and in 1996 the SID Karl Ferdinand Braun Prize. The University of Hull was the first university to be awarded the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement, in 1979, for the liquid crystal joint-development work. Gray has been a Director of the International Liquid Crystal Society. Members of the British Liquid Crystal Society honoured his achievements by establishing the George W. Gray Medal for contributions to liquid crystal research and technology. In March 2013, the University of Hull celebrated the 40th anniversary of Gray's seminal paper being published on 22 March 1973. Hull Trains named their first British Rail Class 222 'Pioneer' high-speed train Professor George Gray in recognition of his achievements in the modern history of Hull. Private life In 1953 George Gray married Marjorie Canavan, who died two weeks before her husband. They lived in Furzehill in Wimborne Minster in Dorset. They had three daughters..

It forms a gradual sloping process at the anterior most portion of the basilar occipital bone at its junction with the sphenoid bone. On axial planes, it sits just posterior to the sphenoid sinuses. Just lateral to the clivus bilaterally is the foramen lacerum (the internal carotid artery reaches the middle cranial fossa above the foramen lacerum), proximal to its anastomosis with the Circle of Willis. Posterior to the clivus is the basilar artery. The pons sits on the clivus. Clivus is also used as an abbreviated term for the clivus ocularis which is the sloping inner wall of the retina as it dips into the foveola in the macula of the eye. For this reason, and to disambiguate, the clivus is sometimes referred to as the Blumenbach clivus. Clinical importance The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) tracks along the clivus during its course. Increased intracranial pressure can trap the nerve at this point and cause signs of palsy. Clivus is also the site for chordoma (a rare malignant tumour.) Surgery for lesions involving the clivus and surrounding structures have traditionally been approached via extended subfrontal transbasal, anterior transfacial, lateral transtemporal, far- lateral approaches, and staged approaches. These approaches are limited in that they often require extensive bone removal and brain retraction while placing critical neurovascular structures between the surgeon and the site of pathology. It has been proposed that these limitations are mitigated by significant advancements in the use of endoscopic endonasal surgery. Contemporary surgical approaches involving extended endoscopic endonasal approaches to the clivus have been increasingly described by several groups, and have been shown to be a safe and effective strategy for the surgical management of a variety of benign and malignant lesions. Relation of the clivus and dens The clivus is an important landmark for checking for anatomical atlanto-occipital alignment; the clivus, when viewed on a lateral C-spine X-ray, forms a line which, if extended, is known as Wackenheim's clivus line. Wackenheim's clivus line should pass through the dens of the axis or be tangential to it.McKenna DA, Roche CJ, Lee KW, Torreggiani WC, Duddalwar VA.

Det Norske Luftfartsselskap (DNL) had exclusive rights for the route and initially flew it using a Junkers W 34 with floats called \\"Ternen\\". It soon became clear that the W 34 was too small and Summer 1936 DNL upgraded to a larger Junkers Ju 52 with floats. All flights were put on hold in 1940 during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. After the war DNL restarted the coastal route using the same equipment. Wider√∏e later took over the local coastal routes. Since the float planes could only be operated during daylight and in good weather, a more stable air transport solution was deemed necessary as the volume of traffic steadily grew.

(AMCA) is a long- established American trade body that sets standards for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment. It is best known for its ratings in fan balance and vibration, aerodynamic performance, air density, speed and efficiency. AMCA was formed in 1955 from several earlier trade associations which could be traced back to the fan-testing requirements of the US Navy in 1923. It is a nonprofit organization that issues over 60 publications and standards, including testing methods, a Certified Ratings Program (CRP), application guides, educational texts, and safety guides. Membership and Activities AMCA membership is open to any company that manufactures or holds the design of a product that falls under the AMCA scope. AMCA publications and standards are developed when sufficient interest has been expressed by AMCA members. Publication and standard writing committees are composed of volunteers, which include both AMCA members and interested individuals with a technical background. All AMCA standards are proposed as American National Standards. AMCA lobbies code bodies on the behalf of member companies to ensure that member company products are represented in local and national codes. AMCA hosts two educational seminars in alternating years. The Technical Seminar, next occurring in 2009, provides engineers with basic information regarding devices and engineering principles relevant to the air movement and air control industry. The Engineering Conference is a discussion forum for presentation of engineering papers written by engineers and experts in the air movement and control industry. U.S. licensed engineers attending either seminar are eligible for approximately 12 Professional Development Hours. The AMCA headquarters is located at 30 West University Drive, Arlington Heights, IL 60004 USA. Certified Ratings Program The AMCA Certified Ratings Program (CRP) is a program which allows all manufacturers of air movement and air control devices to obtain an AMCA Seal when their equipment has been tested and rated in accordance with recognized test standards. The goal of the AMCA CRP is to ensure that a manufacturer's product lines have been tested and rated in conformance with an approved test standard and rating requirement. Only after the product has been tested and the manufacturer's cataloged ratings have been submitted to and approved by AMCA International's staff, can performance seals be displayed in literature and on equipment. Additionally, each certified / licensed product line is subject to continuing check tests every three years in AMCA International's Laboratory or one of AMCA International's Independent Accredited laboratories.. Publications and Standards AMCA International publishes over 64 publications and standards, including testing methods, a Certified Ratings Program (CRP), application guides, educational texts, and safety guides. AMCA is an accredited ANSI developer, and all AMCA standards are proposed as American National Standards.  Testing Standards  *ANSI/AMCA Standard 204 - Balance Quality and Vibration Levels for Fans addresses the subjects of fan balance and vibration. It defines appropriate fan balance quality and operating vibration levels to those who specify, manufacture, use, and maintain fan equipment. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 210 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Fans for Certified Aerodynamic Performance Rating establishes uniform test methods for a laboratory test of a fan or other air moving device to determine its aerodynamic performance in terms of airflow rate, pressure developed, power consumption, air density, speed of rotation, and efficiency for rating or guarantee purposes. It applies to a fan or other air moving device when air is used as the test gas with the following exceptions: (a) air circulating fans (ceiling fans, desk fans); (b) positive pressure ventilators; (c) compressors with inter-stage cooling; (d) positive displacement machines; (e) test procedures to be used for design, production, or field testing. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 220 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Air Curtain Units For Aerodynamic Performance Rating establishes uniform methods for laboratory testing of air curtain units to determine aerodynamic performance in terms of airflow rate, outlet air velocity uniformity, power consumption and air velocity projection for rating or guarantee purposes. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 230 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Air Circulating Fans for Rating and Certification establishes uniform methods of laboratory testing for air circulating fans in order to determine performance in terms of thrust for rating, certification or guarantee purposes. The 1999 version, in general, described a method to determine the thrust developed and used a simple equation to convert the measured thrust to airflow. During the periodic review process it was determined that the calculated airflow was too high, therefore this version no longer artificially calculates airflow, but leaves the measured performance in units of thrust. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 240 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Positive Pressure Ventilators for Aerodynamic Performance Rating establishes a uniform method of laboratory testing of positive pressure ventilators (PPVs) in order to determine the aerodynamic performance in terms of airflow rate, pressure, air density, and speed of rotation for rating or guarantee purposes. PPVs are portable fans that can be positioned relative to an opening of an enclosure and cause it to be positively pressurized by discharge air. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 250 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Jet Tunnel Fans for Performance was developed in response to the need for a standard method of testing jet tunnel fans, sometimes called impulse fans, which have seen increasing use in the United States. The test procedures outlined in this standard are in harmony with those found in ISO 13350. This standard deals with the determination of those technical characteristics needed to describe all aspects of the performance of jet tunnel fans. It does not cover those fans designed for ducted applications or those designed solely for air circulation, e.g., ceiling fans and table fans. The test procedures described relate to laboratory conditions. The measurement of performance under in-situ conditions is not included. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 260 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Induced Flow Fans for Rating establishes a uniform method of laboratory testing of induced flow fans in order to determine their aerodynamic performance in terms of inlet and outlet airflow rate, pressure developed, power consumption, air density, speed of rotation, and efficiency. This standard is an adjunct to AMCA 210 in order to accommodate the induced flow fan's unique characteristics. Induced flow fans are housed fans whose outlet airflow is greater than their inlet airflow due to induced airflow. They are generally used in laboratory or hazardous atmosphere exhaust applications. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 300 - Reverberant Room Method for Sound Testing of Fans applies to fans of all types and sizes. It is limited to the determination of airborne sound emission for the specified setups. Vibration is not measured, nor is the sensitivity of airborne sound emission to vibration effects determined. The test setup requirements in this standard establish the laboratory conditions necessary for a successful test. Rarely will it be possible to meet these requirements in a field situation. This standard is not intended for field measurements. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 301 - Methods of Calculating Fan Sound Ratings from Laboratory Test Data establishes standard methods for calculating consistent fan sound ratings from laboratory test data. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 320 - Laboratory Methods of Sound Testing of Fans Using Sound Intensity establishes a method of determining the octave band sound power levels of a fan. The sound power levels are determined using sound intensity measurements on a measurement surface that encloses the sound source. Guidelines are provided on suitable test environment acoustical characteristics, the measurement surface, and the number of intensity measurements. Test setups are designated generally to represent the physical orientation of fans as installed following ANSI/AMCA 210 and also used in ANSI/AMCA 300. The method is reproducible when all requirements of the method are met. This standard applies to fans of all types and sizes. It is limited to the determination of airborne sound emission for the specified setups. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 500-D - Laboratory Methods of Testing Dampers for Rating establishes uniform laboratory test methods for dampers including air leakage, pressure drop, dynamic closure, operational torque and elevated temperature testing. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 500-L - Laboratory Methods of Testing Louvers for Rating establishes uniform test methods for louvers including air leakage, pressure drop, water penetration, wind driven rain and operational torque. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 510 - Methods of Testing Heavy Duty Dampers for Rating establishes testing methods to be used in measuring the performance of dampers generally described as ‚Äúcustom design,‚Äù ‚Äúheavy duty‚Äù or ‚Äúsevere service‚Äù normally used in applications where elevated temperature, erosion and/or corrosion conditions exist, including dampers which are used to control the flow of gas, or to isolate one section of a duct system from another section of the system. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 520 - Laboratory Methods for Testing Actuators establishes an industry standard for minimum rating and testing of actuators used on fire/smoke dampers. Requirements cover torque or force rating, long term holding, operational life, elevated temperature performance, periodic maintenance, production, and sound testing for both pneumatic and electric operators. *AMCA Standard 540 - Test Method for Louvers Impacted by Wind Borne Debris establishes uniform methods for laboratory testing of louvers that are impact tested with the large missile described in ASTM E 1996-04 and E 1886-05. *ANSI/AMCA Standard 610 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Airflow Measurement Stations for Performance Rating establishes a laboratory test method under which a permanently installed airflow measurement station may be tested for rating. Includes descriptions of the test facility requirements, reference airflow sources and presentation of test results. *AMCA Standard 803 - Industrial Process/Power Generation Fans: Site Performance Test Standard establishes uniform methods to determine the aerodynamic performance of large fans in-situ. Includes procedures for determining whether the airflow pattern is such that a test can be conducted with confidence.

Additional independent AMCA accredited laboratories are under construction in Korea and China. History The Air Movement and Control Association, International was founded in 1955 when the National Association of Fan Manufacturers (NAFM) combined with the Power Fan Manufacturers Association (PFMA) and the Industrial Unit Heater Association (IUHA). Originally known as the Air Moving and Conditioning Association, AMCA was retitled in 1960 to its current name. In 1996, the AMCA Board of Directors added the term 'International' to AMCA's name in order to better indicate the global scope of AMCA's membership. In 1923, the first edition of the Fan Test Codes was developed as a result of problems encountered by the U.S. Navy in regards to performance ratings of fans being procured during World War 1. To resolve the issue of variations in testing methods and performance ratings, a joint committee of NAFM and the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers (ASHVE) was formed to develop a standard test code for fans. When NAFM combined with PFMA and IUHA, the organization's major concern was the accuracy and practicality of the pitot traverse method of testing, and a committee was formed to study various test methods and develop a new test code. To aid in the study, AMCA sponsored research by the Battelle Memorial Institute to compare the test results using the pitot tube test methods and nozzle test methods. The result of this effort was a new revision of the test code, which was published in 1960 as AMCA Standard Test Code for Air Moving Devices, Bulletin 210. Standard 210 became widely accepted and known as virtually the only standard used in the United States and Canada. In 1985, AMCA expanded its scope to include air control devices, such as louvers, dampers, and airflow measurement stations. In 1996, AMCA's first accredited laboratory, ITRI, began testing in Taiwan. In 2008, AMCA's second independent accredited laboratory, AFMA, began testing in Singapore.

It was directed by Philip Dunne and produced by Herbert B. Swope Jr. from a screenplay adapted by Dunne from the play by Samson Raphaelson. The music score was by David Raksin and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald. The film was made in Technicolor and Cinemascope. The film stars Jean Simmons, Guy Madison, and Jean-Pierre Aumont, with Evelyn Varden and Peggy Knudsen. Plot In the five years since she left Winona, her hometown, Hilda Crane has been divorced twice and acquired quite a dubious reputation. She returns from New York to a scolding mother, who hopes Hilda will have the good sense to marry successful builder Russell Burns and finally settle down. A former professor and lover, Jacques DeLisle, is still holding a grudge because Hilda left him for an athlete. Although she doesn't love Russell, she resists and resents Jacques' aggressive romantic advances. She accepts a proposal of marriage from Russell, who intends to build her a new house. Warned by a friend about Russell's possessive mother, including her way of feigning a heart condition, Hilda declines a $50,000 bribe from Mrs. Burns to leave town. She leaves the elderly woman slumped in a chair and proceeds to the church for the wedding. Mrs. Burns was not pretending this time, however, and has died. Months later, still living in her mother-in-law's house, Hilda has begun to drink while Russell becomes indifferent to her and morose. A day comes when Hilda's mother castigates her again and she can take any more. Hilda swallows a bottle of sleeping pills, intent on committing suicide. But she survives and is cheered by Russell's promise to restore their love and start building their new house. Cast * Jean Simmons ‚Äì Hilda Crane * Guy Madison ‚Äì Russell Burns * Judith Evelyn ‚Äì Mrs. Crane * Evelyn Varden ‚Äì Mrs. Burns * Gregg Palmer ‚Äì Dink * Richard Garrick ‚Äì Dr. Francis * Jim Hayward ‚Äì Mr. Small * Don Shelton ‚Äì Caterer * Helen Mayon ‚Äì Maid * Jay Jostyn ‚Äì Minister * Peggy Knudsen ‚Äì Nell Bromley * Jean-Pierre Aumont ‚Äì Jacques De Lisle * Marie Blake ‚Äì Clara Original play The film was based on a play by Samson Raphaelson. The play was based on seven stories Raphaelson had written that were published in Good Housekeeping magazine. Raphaelson said the play started out \\"to be a study of the tragic interplay between a mother and a daughter.\\" He wanted to do something that explored a woman torn between wanting independence and being a mother and wife. He struggled to write it over ten years, until he met a woman who was similar to the sort of woman he wanted to write about, and based the play on her. He wrote that the play became \\"a story of how marriage and love and death happened, at least in this case, to stem from the fumbling, painful efforts of a woman and her mother to understand each other and themselves.\\" The play was meant to have been presented by the Theatre Guild in 1949. Joan Fontaine had been sought to play the part and was meant to appear in it following her making September Affair. However, she withdrew, saying she did not want to be separated from husband William Dozier. Margaret Sullavan was approached but turned it down saying the play \\"needed a lot of work\\". She changed her mind but then withdrew again. Ingrid Bergman turned it down, and June Havoc was considered. Herman Schumlin and Peter Glenville were sought to direct. Eventually after a year of being unable to get the right star the Theatre Guild withdrew, and Arthur Schwartz, a composer, decided to present it. Jessica Tandy took the lead role, her first on Broadway since Streetcar Named Desire. Raphaelson had directed his own plays in the past but they were comedies and this one was a drama so he sought an outside director \\"who knows more about it [drama] than I do\\". Tandy's husband Hume Cronyn was hired to do the job. The original play had its first performance on Broadway on November 1, 1950 at the Coronet Theatre, directed by Hume Cronyn and designed by Howard Bay. Also in the cast were John Alexander, Beulah Bondi, Frank Sundstrom, Evelyn Varden, and Eileen Heckart. Of the stage cast, only Evelyn Varden appears in the film. The New York Times called it \\"well written...and admirably acted...but there is no getting away from the fact the heroine is a tiresome, irritating egotist.\\" Production In September 1955, the play was among six properties that 20th Century Fox purchased from the Charles Feldman Group (the others included The Wayward Bus, Lonely Steeple, Tender Mercy, Bernadine and Heaven Knows, Mr Allison). In November 1955, 20th Century Fox announced that it had purchased the film rights and that the movie would be written and directed by Phillip Dunne. The film was produced by Herbert Swope, his first film since coming from television. The film initially was announced for Susan Hayward'. In December, the role went to Jean Simmons. Dunne was the screenwriter on three previous 20th Century Fox epic films which star Simmons, The Robe (1953), Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) and The Egyptian (1954). Filming started January 4, 1956. Reception According to Dunne, the film was neither a critical or financial success.

Based in Cannock, Staffordshire, the organisation has over 200 affiliate clubs, catering for motocross, trials, enduro and historical motocross. The organisation is based around amateur riders, with one of the organisation's main objectives being that motorcycles ridden by members and all modified parts fitted are on general sale. Initially formed in 1932, the organisation was based primarily around the West Midlands, but has since spread across the United Kingdom. The organisation is part of the IMBA (International Motorsport Bond for Amateurs) and some of the AMCA's top motocross rider compete in European championships against European counterparts from similar organisations. The AMCA also owns several race tracks in the UK, along with ancillary equipment that is regularly used by AMCA clubs to stage race meetings.  AMCA Championships  Championships Each year Championships are run for the MX1, MX2 and Sidecar classes, usually 8 events with 3 races at each event and with all races counting. Riders qualify to compete in the AMCA MX1 & MX2 Class solo Championships in local events, usually in the previous season. Sidecars usually go straight through to the Championship but qualifying events may be run should the number of entries exceed the number of Championship places. Riders must have held an AMCA Licence in the previous season but if room permits new riders may be allowed to ride in qualifying races without having held a licence previously. Automatic Qualifiers The top 30 finishers in the MX1 & MX2 Classes automatically qualify for the following years Championship. Qualifying Rounds Group qualifiers are usually run whilst the Championship is being run throughout the season. Area qualifiers are normally organised after the Championships have finished so as to include those riders who did not finish in the top 20 and wish to enter following years Championships. These riders are not eligible for the Superclass. Superclass The top 18 riders from the current Championships for MX1 & MX2 class will be eligible to compete in the Superclass. Riders in this class may ride any capacity machine as it is an unlimited c.c. class. Riders will not be allowed to ride elsewhere on the same day as a Superclass round. Riders who finished 19-20 in the Championships will be reserves. Internationals Since 1966 the AMCA has been a member of the IMBA (International Motocross Bond for Amateurs), which includes similar organisations in France, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Italy and the Czech Republic. Most of the countries compete in the 125cc, Open and Sidecar Championships. Most countries run a round (3 races) and all rounds count for the IMBA's European Moto Cross Championships. The AMCA do contribute towards travelling expenses to the meetings abroad and arrange the entries. In addition there are several non- Championship Internationals held during the year and riders selected by the AMCA may receive expenses from the organising club. Over the years many AMCA clubs have enjoyed events abroad, combining the event with holidays. AMCA International Teams These are selected from the AMCA's National Championship the previous year as most of the IMBA's European Championships commence in March and usually finish in September. Due to the events abroad plus the AMCA Championship rounds it is too difficult to have AMCA qualifying rounds in the same season, hence the need to qualify the previous season.

Paper trading (sometimes also called \\"virtual stock trading\\") is a simulated trading process in which would-be investors can 'practice' investing without committing real money. This is done by the manipulation of imaginary money and investment positions that behave in a manner similar to the real markets. New investors can practice making (or losing) fortunes time and time again before actually committing financially. Investors also use paper trading to test new and different investment strategies. Stock market games are often used for educational purposes. For example, investors can create several different positions simultaneously to compare the performance and payoff characteristics between multiple strategies. A textbook may state that writing a covered call is synthetically the same as writing a naked put, but in practice there are subtle differences. With a paper trading account, an investor can set up a bull credit spread and a bull debit spread simultaneously and watch how the payoff for each position changes as the market moves. Other advanced strategies include leverage, short-selling, forex and derivatives trading. Successful execution and profit generation from these strategies usually require high levels of technical knowledge. Investors can test these strategies with paper trading to avoid taking on excessive risk due to inexperience. Various companies and online trading simulation tools offer paper trading services, some free, others with charges, that allow investors to try out various strategies (some stock brokerage firms allow 14-day 'demo accounts'), or paper trading can be carried out simply by noting down fees and recording the value of investments over time. The imaginary money of paper trading is sometimes also called \\"paper money,\\" \\"virtual money,\\" and \\"Monopoly money.\\"  Types  Stock market simulators can be broken down into two major categories - financial market simulators, and fantasy simulators.  Financial simulators  Financial market simulators allow users to generate a portfolio based on real stock entries and help them train with virtual currency. Most of the currently active financial simulators use a delayed data feed of between 15 and 20 minutes to ensure that users cannot use their data to trade actively on a competing system. Some simulators can produce random data to mimic price activity. The purpose behind such a system is to let a person practice with fantasy funds in a real-world context so they can determine whether or not they would gain money investing by themselves.  Fantasy simulators  Fantasy simulators trade shares or derivatives of real world items or objects that normally would not be listed on a commodities list or market exchange, such as movies or television shows. Some simulators focus on sports and have been linked to active betting and wager based systems.  Technology and implementation  Most of the online stock simulators run on either C, C#, Java, JavaScript, ASP or PHP with a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. Some of them are open source, and others are proprietary with the code being sold as valuable prediction market software. Such is the example with the HSX Virtual Specialist. This technology has been sold to major film studios such as MGM and Lion's Gate Films, as well as to the Popular Science team for use in their PPX system.The Science behind PPX Stock Market simulator engines can also be customized for other functions than just basic stock information tracking. The HSX engine has been modified to track popular science trends and also to track YouTube videos. Other applications that can be implemented with this software include popularity tracking and ranking from a set scale rather than an actual numerical value.  Stock market games  Stock market games are speculative games that allows players to trade stocks, futures, or currency in a virtual or simulated market environment. Stock market games exist in several forms but the basic underlying concept is that these games allow players to gain experience or just entertainment by trading stocks in a virtual world where there is no real risk. Some stock market games do not involve real money in any way. Players compete with each other to see who can predict the direction the stock markets will go next. Many stock market games are based on real life stocks from the Nasdaq, NYSE, AMEX or other major market indexes. Stock market games are often used for educational purposes to teach potential stock traders and future stock brokers how to trade stocks. Stock market games can also be used for entertainment purposes and to engage in fantasy trading competitions. Some stock market games are not based on financial markets at all. These virtual stock markets are often based on things like sports or entertainment 'stocks'. Players are asked to invest in a particular sports team for example. If the team is doing well, the stock goes up and if the team is playing badly the stock value for that team falls. Stock market games are often built into many other prediction games. Relevance Simulators could be deceptive or sometimes misleading, giving the beginner a wrong impression that live trading is an \\"easy fill\\".

It is named for the Uskoks, soldiers from Croatia used by the Austrians for irregular warfare. Since the Uskoks were checked on land and were rarely paid their annual salary, they resorted to piracy. In addition to attacking Turkish ships, they attacked Venetian merchantmen. Although the Venetians tried to protect their shipping with escorts, watchtowers and other protective measures, the cost became prohibitive: 120,000 thalers annually during the 1590s, 200,000 in the 1600s and 360,000 by 1615.Parker, Geoffrey. The Thirty Years' War, 2nd edition. 1997. In December 1615 Venetian troops besieged Gradisca, on the Isonzo River. The Venetians launched a diplomatic campaign for allies, since the Uskoks were vassals of Archduke Ferdinand of Inner Austria (who was likely to seek help from the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias, his uncle and King Philip III of Spain, his brother-in-law). In September 1616, Count John Ernest of Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men in the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 with a contingent of English volunteers. Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships, and on land by the war in Mantua. Beginning The conflict began in January 1616 in the Gorizia Hills, where a garrison of Uskok and Segnani supported the Austrian faction. After the Venetian faction gained the advantage in Mariano, they advanced to Gradisca d'Isonzo on 24 February 1616 and camped in Farra. The Venetian Republic, powerful at sea, was master of the Adriatic; Austria had a small part of the coast of Trieste and Croatia which was blocked by Venice. No vessel could pass this border without paying taxes or having a Venetian residence. In January 1616, the Gorizia Hills (Collio) were guarded by Uskoks and Segnani in Vipulzano and San Martino di Quisco. A Venetian detachment remained in the field of Mariano. Romans and Medeans, camped near Farra, advanced on 24 February 1616 towards Gradisca. The siege lasted for twenty-nine days. The Venetian fleet crashed in Trieste, whose garrison was reinforced by Captain Sebastian Zuech. With 1,000 cavalry and infantry, Benedict Lezze occupied the Venetian castle of San Servolo. Uskok troops led by Vuk Frankopan (Wolfgang Frangipane), the Count of Tr≈æac (Terszatz) and vice-general of Croatia, arrived in Monfalcone on 26 November 1615 and plundered the town. The Venetian garrison was restricted to the fortress. On the Karst Plateau, near Lokev (Corgnale) in present-day Slovenia, 1,200 Croatian soldiers, 500 horsemen and 500 Uskoks faced 3,000 Venetians led by Lezze. Although the Duke of Savoy proposed an alliance, the Venetian Senate refused. The administrator of present-day Palmanova mobilized the militias of Savorgnan and Friuli, a total of 3,000 men. The raids began around the Habsburg Gradisca fortress. In the first phase of the war, action in Venice was characterized by mobile offensive forces and the element of surprise. The Archduke abandoned a number of cities (Cervignano, Aquileia, Castelporpetto, Maranutto, Mariano, Romans d'Isonzo, Cormons and Medea Sagrado), castles and villages to defend stronger positions. Repulsed, the Uskoks plundered the surrounding villages and the Venetian Loredan administrator received reinforcements to defend the south from their incursions. Poreƒç (Parenzo) and Rovinj (Rovigno) sent artillery, and Pula sent food and weapons. The armies were concentrated in Svetvinƒçenat (Sanvincenti), Istria. Battle of Zaule With a galley and several smaller ships, Lezze landed in the Muggia valley. Venetians, with six squads guided by Capt. Fabio Gallo, occupied the Zaule salt pan and began to destroy it. Captain Daniel Francol came from the Karst Plateau, followed by Vuk Frankopan, the Count of Tr≈æac, and musketeers under Capt. Sebastian Zuech. The Venetians, caught by surprise, fled to the ships but Lezze blocked his troops' escape. The Venetian galleys opened fire indiscriminately with cannons. Both sides incurred casualties; the Austrians lost voivode Verdonoviz, leader of the Croats, who was killed by cannon fire from a galley. First Siege of Gradisca Gradisca Castle In 1616 the Venetians besieged Farra and Gradisca, and the archduke attacked from Gorizia and Lucinico. With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra (despite damage to its buildings) repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 (including a contingent of English volunteers). Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskoks were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj. Battle of Lucinico Pompeo Giustiniani was flanked by Francesco Ferrante and Martinengo de Rossi. Marcantonio of Manzano, Camillo Trevor's cavalry squadrons and a group of Albanians resumed their raids, killing 60 at the castle of St. Florian and the surrounding area. Adam von Trautmannsdorf received reinforcements, crossed the Isonzo and fortified Lucenico and Gradisca. The Venetians attacked Trautmannsdorf at dawn with three columns from Mariano, Corona, San Lorenzo and Mossa, led by Orazio Baglioni. The Albanians were in the centre of the Count of Porcia's mercenaries and the cavalry on the right of Francis Camillo Martinengo and Trevor, for a total of 4,000 men. The Albanians occupied the trenches in Lucinico, but instead of advancing they looted the dead soldiers; the other columns incurred heavy losses and were forced to retreat. The Venetians reduced their military activity, and the Austrians received reinforcements. War in the Alps Barbarigo was replaced by Antonio Priuli on 2 June. Priuli obtained fresh Friulian and Dalmatian troops, strengthened his field fortifications and led diversionary raids in Istria. The Austrians responded with raids in Monfalcone. In Monfalconese the Albanian troops faced a strong Venetian attack, sustaining heavy losses. The war extended into the Alps, and the Venetians plundered Kobarid and Tolmin. Schmit, an English mercenary captain with 400 men hired by the bishop of Bamberg, took Pontebba on 8 August. A counterattack led by Marcantonio of Manzano retook Pontebba and Malborghetto Valbruna five days later. The Austrians, weakened by illness, lost a third of their army and retreated across the Isonzo; the Venetians occupied Lucenico. Second Siege of Gradisca Count John Ernest of Nassau landed in Monfalcone with 4,000 Dutch mercenaries, increasing the Venetian forces to 20,000 men; English volunteers also arrived. The Venetians prepared for a massive advance on 1 June. Giovanni de Medici moved to Monfalcone, and Govanni Martinego moved from Mariano through Cassegliano to San Pier d'Isonzo. The right wing of Ferdinand Scotus' cavalry moved from Mariano through Fratta and Monfalcone to Vermegliano, where he was joined by Orazio Baglioni's infantry. The Dutch mercenaries advanced towards the Karst Plateau; brothers Francis and Charles Strassoldo, with 200 armored men, 300 arquebuses, two squadrons of cavalry and one of infantry, took up positions between Farra and Mainizza with large cavalry companies from Cividale del Friuli and Udine. At dawn on 2 June the Dutch occupied San Martino del Carso, and the Austrians abandoned their positions between Gradisca and the plateau to the Venetians. With a thousand men, Camillo Trevigliano engaged the Austrians in Gorizia. Six galleys attacked Duino Castle. The following day the Dutch overran Forte Delle Donne (on Monte San Michele), opening a gap after the arrival of Martinego's artillery; its 42 defenders surrendered. On 5 June, the 400 men at Fort Imperial surrendered to the Dutch in exchange for free passage. The Venetians built several small reduits, placing forty pieces and preparing a final assault on Rubbia (the Austrian headquarters). Although civilians began evacuating Gorizia, on 6 June Henry of Nassau refused to continue the assault due to the fatigue of his men. The Austrians strengthened their defenses, but during an inspection on 7 June Trautmansdorf was killed by artillery fire. He was succeeded by Baltasar Marradas, who used subterfuge to capture the Venetians. The Austrians repulsed assaults on Rubbia beginning from 9 to 12 June, and the wounded Henry of Nassau brought food to Gradisca. The Venetians refrained from further offensives, intensifying the blockade of Gradisca; disease halved the Dutch forces. Austrian reinforcements arrived, led by Albrecht von Wallenstein. The Austrians advanced in three columns from Farra, Gradisca and Gorizia, inflicting heavy losses on Camillo Treviglio's Albanian forces (including commanders Marcantonio Manzano and Leonardo and Pietro Avogadro Gualdo). One column attacked the Venetians blocking Fort Stella, killing Orazio Baglioni and seizing the trenches on Monte San Michele. Giovanni de Medici left his command for health reasons, and was replaced by Prince Luigi d'Este. Although the Venetians surrounded Fort Stella, Albrecht von Wallenstein brought in reinforcements and supplies.Ripley, George & Charles Anderson Dana. (1858) The New American Cyclopaedia, D. Appleton and Company. pp. 185‚Äì189. He used his wealth, offering and commanding 200 horses for Archduke Ferdinand of Styria for the war and relieving the fortress of Gradisca from the Venetian siege.Di Bert, Marino Vicende storiche gradiscane, Societ√† Filologica Friulana, Udine, pp. 65‚Äì104. To block Austrian supplies from the valley, the Venetians considered occupying Sdraussina and Fogliano (south of Gradisca). Although the occupation was planned in detail by Don Giovanni de' Medici on 25 August 1617, it was not carried on because it was considered too dangerous and relief to the fort from the plateau continued.Caimmi Riccardo, La guerra del Friuli, Altrimenti nota come la guerra di gradisca o degli Uscocchi, ed. Goriziana 2007, pp. 164‚Äì165. Although Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from Spain as part of a larger deal: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj. Peace In the face of ongoing hostilities, there was a yearning for peace on both sides. In anticipation of problems in Germany, Ferdinand wanted to break away from the commitment of the war with Venice. In any case, Venice was also uncommitted to the war, largely due to fear of direct Spanish intervention. On 6 November, a truce was signed and on 28 November, demobilisation began. However, peace talks were prolonged and the Netherlands continued to recruit soldiers. The Treaty of Peace concluded through the mediation of Philip III, Emperor Matthias de Romans and King of Bohemia, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria and the Republic of Venice (now known as the Preliminary Treaty of Paris and the Treaty of Madrid) resolved that pirates would be driven from the maritime areas of the House of Austria. The Venetians returned to their Imperial and Royal Majesty all the places occupied by them in Istria and Friuli. The Venetians, did, however, achieve the expulsion of Uskoks by Mark and at the same time, the recognition of their sovereignty over the Gulf. Nevertheless, the overall picture was bleak: in the early 1600s, Friuli was in misery, famine, fever, livestock diseases and incursions of wolves.

Its signal covers Youngstown, Warren, and New Castle, PA, and at times even reaches Erie and New Kensington, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh market). However, as one approaches Meadville and points east, a station from Jamestown, New York starts to interfere with WNCD's signal. WNCD goes by the nickname \\"93.3 The Wolf\\". WNCD's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD and EAS. WNCD's morning programming comes from Rover's Morning Glory, from 6am to 10am. Until May 2007, the station's playlist featured an active rock format, playing classic rock from artists such as Led Zeppelin, Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC and Metallica, while playing new rock from bands like Nickelback, Mudvayne, Breaking Benjamin, Staind, Disturbed, Tool, Chevelle, Three Days Grace, Linkin Park, Puddle of Mudd and Seether. Since 2007, WNCD has played more classic rock than new rock and is considered a Mainstream Rock Station. The station primarily competes with WYFM for listeners. The station secondarily competes with WONE from Akron, WRQK from Canton, WNCX and WMMS from Cleveland, and WDVE and WXDX from Pittsburgh.

At one time, WNCD simulcast its signal on WLLF 96.7 FM in Mercer, Pennsylvania, aiming for listeners in the eastern part of the Youngstown market into Western Pennsylvania. WLLF still carries the \\"Wolf\\"-derived calls today, despite new ownership and numerous format changes. After coming under common ownership with sister WBBG, WNCD traded for the much stronger 93.3 frequency. In the past, the station has been branded as \\"CD 93.3 The Wolf\\" and \\"93.3 NCD\\", the latter name being derived from fellow iHeartMedia Mainstream rock station WDVE in Pittsburgh which goes by the name \\"102.5 DVE\\".

In 1545, during the War of the Rough Wooing, the Earl of Hertford burned \\"Mantoncrake\\", or Mynto Crag. The castle is said to have obtained its unusual name from the habit of the members of the house to greet guests with less discretion than was considered decent at the time.

It was extensively restored in 1857, while the interior was renovated by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1897‚Äì8 as a shooting lodge and private museum. The building was in use until the 1960s. On 18 November 2011, it was announced that a major restoration of the building would take place, with work expected to be complete by 2013.

Hagan, born Helene Coll (born in 1939 in Rabat, Morocco), is an American anthropologist and Amazigh activist. Biography Hagan immigrated to the United States in 1960. She is the mother of three children. After obtaining a License-es-Lettres from the Facult√© des Sciences et des Lettres, University of Bordeaux in France in 1969, she obtained a master's degree in French Literature from Stanford University in 1971. She pursued her doctoral studies in anthropology at Stanford University, California. She is of Berber and Catalan ancestries. Her paternal family name Coll is from the Pyrenees Mountain village of Prats-de-Mollo. Hagan directed a photo project with elders on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota, with a grant from the South Dakota Committee on the Humanities, for the benefit of the Archives of the Oglala Lakota Community College from 1983 to 1985, with subsequent showing of the photo exhibit she created in National parks and at the Rotunda, Washington, D.C. She subsequently taught at John F. Kennedy University in California for a number of years, while helping Lakota artists by opening an art gallery \\"Lakota Contemporary Designs\\" in Marin county (1985-1990). She was instrumental in the creation of a series of 11 community television programs under the title \\"Circles\\" on American Indians in Marin and Sonoma Counties, followed by another series of 15 half-hour episodes on the Amazigh culture of Morocco, which she personally videographed \\"Tamazgha, Berber land of Morocco.\\" Finally, she initiated and produced six half-hour episodes (The Russell Means Show, 1999-2003), with long-time friend American Indian activist and actor Russell Means as host, taped in Santa Monica for community television. Hagan has authored numerous articles published in a variety of newspapers and journals. Among these are her well-known article on \\"Plastic Medicine People\\" originally published in the Sonoma Press Democrat, and \\"Apuleius, Amazigh Philosopher\\" published in The Amazigh Voice, a scholarly journal which also recently published an article of hers titled \\"The Argan Tree.\\" (2005) She is the author of five books The Shining Ones: An Etymological Essay on the Amazigh Roots of Archaic Egyptian Civilization (2000), Tuareg Jewelry: Traditional Patterns and Symbols (2006), Tazz'unt, Ecology, Ritual and Social Order in the Tessawt Valley of the High Atlas of Morocco\\" (2011), \\"Fifty Years in America, A Book of Essays,(2013) and \\"Russell C. Means The European Ancestry of a Militant Indian\\" (2017). This last book was followed by a second 2018 edition, titled \\"Russell Means The European Ancestry of a Militant Indian\\", which elaborates the historical context of French and Indian intermarriages in early America, during the fur trading era and the bison hunting in the Plains. It also includes a chapter on the public access television series, \\"The Russell Means Show,\\" which Hagan produced and Means hosted. The first book pioneered the hypothesis of a link between an archaic Egyptian culture, the proto-Berber culture of North Africa, and the Tuareg- Berber cultures of the Sahara desert, focusing on rock art research, archaeology, and comparative linguistics. The second book traces the origins and development of Tuareg (Amazigh) art from rock art to modern jewelry design and production. The third is an anthropological study of a small community of Berber people in the mountains of Morocco, and the fourth an anthology of essays written over several decades on American Indian and Amazigh issues. Hagan was twice elected and served on the board of directors of the Amazigh Cultural Association in America (A.C.A.A.), between 2002 and 2006. She inherited a large collection of personal papers and unpublished manuscripts of Paul Radin, which she inventoried and deposited in the Special Archives of Marquette University, with the support of a Wenner-Gren Anthropological Grant. She serves as lifetime associate curator for that collection. In 2007, she was one of the professors selected for the First Berber Institute in America, created under an NEH grant at Oregon State University in Corvallis. She introduced participant professors of various universities to the various art forms of North African Amazigh people, including pottery, weaving, jewelry, painting, and cinematography, through a series of seminars. In 2008, she founded the annual Los Angeles Amazigh film Festival, which has presented a variety of films from North Africa. Tazzla Institute for Cultural Diversity Hagan is the executive director of the Tazzla Institute for Cultural Diversity, which she founded in 1993. Through the work of the Tazzla Institute, a 501c(3) non-profit organization, she has been able to promote and defend Amazigh culture, rights and identity at the United Nations through a variety of channels, such as \\"Creating Peace through the Arts and Media,\\" a UNESCO Culture of Peace program, and P.I.P.E (Partnership of Indigenous Peoples for the Environment. The Tazzla Institute is the supporting nonprofit organization for the Los Angeles Amazigh Film Festival, the first film festival in the United States to focus on film content dedicated to the Amazigh world of Berbers and Tuaregs of the vast North African territory called \\"Tamazgha\\", which extends from the Oasis of Siwa in Egypt, through Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, the Canary Islands, and the Sahara desert to the north of Niger, Mali, and Burkina-Faso. In 1993, Hagan created the Tazzla Institute for Cultural Diversity (originally the Institute for Archetypal Ethnology) and Amazigh Video Productions, a project of the Institute in Community Service television. Through this project and the Marin 31 channel, she created three series: 11 half-hour programs titled \\"We're Still Here\\" on American Indians in Marin County; a second 12-episode series on Amazigh (Berber) culture of Morocco; a third series of 4 one-hour programs on the ecology of the San Francisco Bay, a series for the training of students of the Environmental Forum of Marin. In Los Angeles, and for Adelphia communications in Santa Monica and Eagle Rock, Hagan produced a series hosted by the well- known American Indian Movement leader, author, and actor Russell Means, and several programs in a series titled \\"Amazigh News\\" (1998‚Äì2006) featuring human rights reports on Morocco, Algeria and on the Tuareg people of Niger and Mali. Also included in that series was a special half-hour program called \\"Heart of the Sahara\\" on the Berber-Tuareg artisans of Mali.

Distribution and ecology The species' natural distribution covers all major islands of New Zealand: the North and South Islands, Stewart Island/Rakiura, the Chatham Islands, and south to the Auckland Islands. It is common in montane forest, with populations from the southern regions of its range growing in lowland forest. In the Westland forests of South Island, A. smithii occurs in the understory of certain broadleaf/podocarp forests. Description Katote is an understory tree fern that grows up to 8 m tall but tends not reaching into the canopy as do other iconic members of this genus. It grows slowly and is not a strong competitor except at higher altitudes. Like related tree ferns, it has rough scales along its rachis and trunk. A distinctive feature is the retention of dead fronds as a skirt. The skirt is not the whole frond, only the central rachis, making it a more compact skirt than that of Dicksonia fibrosa, another skirt clad tree fern. Alsophila smithii produces masses of very soft and delicate looking fronds which spread horizontally from the crown and reach 2‚Äì2.5 m in length. Cultivation Alsophila smithii suffers in exposure to wind, sun and frost and is prone to drying out, but can be grown successfully in sheltered areas. Uses The pith was traditionally used as a starch source, but as it is rich in resin, it would likely be a food of last resort or at least an acquired taste. Tree fern trunks have been used as rough building material, fencing, and makeshift trackwork. File:Cyathea smithii.jpg|Illustration from The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M.

Broadcaster On 15 January 1927 Wakelam gave the first ever running sports commentary on BBC radio. It covered the Rugby International match between England and Wales at Twickenham. England won 11-9. While Wakelam described the run of play, a background voice would call out a number (this referred to a specific area on the pitch). To assist listeners, a picture showing a rugby field divided into numbered squared was published in the Radio Times. It is believed the British phrase \\"Back to Square One\\" (meaning to restart something) originates from this practice. A week after his broadcasting debut on rugby he and C.A. Lewis provided the first sports commentary of a football on British radio. The games, which was Arsenal - Sheffield United, finished as a 1-1 draw. In the same year he covered cricket and Wimbledon. In the mid 1930s he accidentally set fire to his notes while commentating on the tennis but kept going as if nothing had happened. In June 1938, Wakelam became one of the first sports commentators on BBC television covering the England v Australia second test match at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. Although he commentated on other sports like boxing, his speciality remained rugby union. Wakelam also covered non-sporting events like Tidworth Tattoo. He also worked as a rugby correspondent for The Morning Post and wrote a number of books including the Harlequin Story (1954) about the history of his old club.

When people walk through the center of a spinning tunnel they can experience vertigo and a loss of equilibrium as their brains receive conflicting signals from their bodies and senses. The traditional version of the spinning tunnel consists of a tube made up of a series of rings which is typically up 10 feet high and up 20 feet long. The tunnel liner bears images or designs that create the illusion of movement while the tunnel is in motion. Another type of tunnel uses a stationary tube with LEDs or rope lighting imbedded in the walls which light up in patterns designed to mimic motion. Laser tunnels that can be contained in a domed enclosure are favored by the home haunting industry. Made from parts acquired a at local hardware or discount department store, the tunnels are built using LEDs, incandescent or fluorescent lights, blacklights or lasers‚Äîor any combination thereof‚Äîpaired up with a laser vortex. The laser vortex lighting system projects a rotating pattern onto the mist or fog provided by a fog machine, creating the illusion of a moving vortex. Traversing the tunnel is a beam bridge, usually about 36 inches wide and about 15 inches high, which provides the pathway for visitors to pass through the attraction. Handrails securely fastened along the length of the bridge are necessary for the safety of the participants. Lighting for the tunnel can be mounted under the eaves of the bridge or beneath the handrails, and may consist of rotating colored lights, high-powered LED lights, laser lights or blacklight fixtures. In the case of the laser vortex tunnel, the lighting may be mounted on the floor. The bridges or walkways can be designed to tilt, wobble or vibrate as visitors proceed along the path, providing unstable footing and causing a further loss of balance. For those tunnels not enclosed in buildings, there are various types of enclosures designed to protect the tunnel from the weather and vandals, and to keep visitors safe from contact with moving parts. Background Spinning tunnels depend upon creating sensory confusion between the kinesthetic system, the vestibular system and the visual system. The body's sense of the motion and the position of the limbs is provided by sensors in the joints, the semicircular canals within the inner ears provide sensory data for the head's position relative to the ground, and the eyes provide input concerning where the body is in relationship to its external environment. The spinning tunnel creates an optical illusion affecting the visual system that is in conflict with the other two sensory systems. Because vision is the most developed of the human senses, the visual system overrides the other sensory systems, causing the brain to believe that the bridge is moving. This belief interferes with the sense of balance and induces dizziness and vertigo. Aristotle noted the effect while observing a waterfall, noticing that over time the water seemed to stop moving and the rocks protruding through the waterfall seemed to be moving upward. This phenomenon has come to be known as the waterfall illusion. Rotating tunnels The rotating tunnel consists of a cylinder made of large rings secured together by trusses, rods, or braces. Typically 8‚Äì10 feet in diameter and 10‚Äì20 feet in length, the rings of the cylinder ride on hard rubber tires, large pulleys or spoked rims (as found on a bicycle without the tire). One of the wheels is connected by a belt or chain to an AC motor which drives the cylinder at a rate of 4‚Äì10 revolutions per minute (rpm). Some varieties use a motor mounted above the tunnel. The tunnel is easily stopped as there is no direct connection between the motor and the tunnel. The tunnel is lined with fabric or plastic sheeting that has been painted or imprinted with various designs or images. When the tunnel is rotating, the designs or images create the illusion of movement counter to the rotation. Running through the tunnel is a suspended bridge, usually 28 to 36 inches wide and 8‚Äì16 inches high. At 36 inches wide, the bridge is wheelchair accessible. Handrails line the bridge to keep patrons from falling off the sides into the rotating tube, preventing injury to themselves or damage to the tunnel. Spinning tunnels can be purchased at commercial retailers at prices ranging from US$8,000 up to $35,000 for a trailer mounted system. Construction and materials The construction of a spinning tunnel is formed of several discrete components. There is the base or framework, the tunnel, the drive mechanism, the lighting system, and the bridge or walkway. These components can be made of nearly any material, such as plywood, metals like aluminum or steel, or PVC piping, as long as the materials used to can take the weight of the tunnel and the weight of the guests passing through. Framework The base of the spinning tunnel holds the guide wheels that the tunnel rings rest and roll on. The drive motor for the tunnel that has the drive motor driving the guide wheels will also be installed on this framework. The tunnels that have a drive motor above the tunnel will have a vertical framework that is attached to the base. The guide wheels can be bicycle rims or pulleys which also hold the tunnel in place as it spins. Tunnels that use the hard rubber wheels will have an extra set of horizontal wheels at both ends, attached to the bridge, to keep the tunnel from wandering off the guide wheels. The bridge is also mounted to the base. Tunnel The tunnel is constructed of a series of two to eight rings, usually eight to ten feet in diameter to allow headroom for the people using the tunnel. The vertical rings are connected to horizontal braces forming a cylinder similar in shape to a large coffee can with the ends removed. The interior of the spinning tunnel is lined with fabric or plastic sheeting with secured to the rings and braces in whatever manner is expedient to the builder or designer of the tunnel. Velcro straps, duct tape, and staples are used in different constructions. The liner can be printed or decorated with images or abstract designs that draw the eye and further the optical illusion fostered by the rotating liner. The use of fluorescent inks or paint and black lighting can add to the enjoyment of the attraction by creating a spooky, darkly lit environment. Music or other sound effects help to mask the sound of the rotating tunnel and the operation of the drive motor. Lighting systems The lighting systems for the tunnel can consist of regular incandescent lightbulbs or fluorescent lamps, colored lighting using filters, black lights, LEDs or laser lights. The lighting systems are attached to the bridge or the handrail to illuminate the fabric of the tunnel. Blacklights are most useful when there are fluorescent designs on the fabric of the tunnel. All of the different types of lighting can be programmed to flicker or alternate, adding to the sensory disorientation. Fog machines can be used to give the bridge the illusion of floating in midair. Bridge Installation The installation of spinning tunnels depends upon the circumstances of the location. It has been recommended that the tunnel be installed in a dark location. The illusion of a spinning tunnel works best if there are no external points of reference. The inside of a permanent structure has the benefit of protection from the elements as well as darkness. A tarp-covered enclosure is also a good method for covering the tunnel. Both of these methods also offer protection to patrons from the moving parts, such as the drive motor and the cylinder itself. Another consideration is the entrance and exit. One method of installation is to put the tunnel in a pit equal to the height of the bridge so that patrons can step directly into and out of the tunnel. This is an especially safe method for the exit as the patrons are usually disoriented by the attraction. If the tunnel is installed on a level surface, a ramp should be used, again to provide safety for the user. Steps can be used if space is limited, but lighting should be provided to illuminate the steps for the patrons' safety. The ends of the tunnel need to be enclosed to prevent light entering and to help control the flow of patrons through the attraction. This can be something as simple as plastic or canvas sheets slit like the entrance to a tent or like a coldroom, or is can consist of walls with doors decorated to look like the entrance to a funhouse or a cave. Several serious Halloween enthusiasts have built their own tunnels using materials available to consumers at local outlets. The plans for these projects can be found at various internet sites and in Halloween trade magazines. Stationary tunnels Another type of spinning tunnel is the stationary LED tunnel. Instead of the tunnel spinning around the bridge, LEDs that are embedded in the walls of the tube are programmed to turn on and off in sequence, presenting the illusion of movement. While the method of visual presentation is different‚Äîlight is transmitted directly to the eyes rather than reflected off a liner‚Äîthe effect is the same.

Pitera was suspected by law enforcement of as many as 100 murders. Pitera was well known for his use of karate and other martial arts when fighting, a skill he had learned at a young age; it earned him the nickname \\"Tommy Karate\\". Biography Early years Thomas Pitera grew up in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York to parents Joseph (Joe) and Catherine Pitera. Thomas attended the David A. Boody Junior High School in Gravesend, where he left little impression with his teachers and was bullied by his peers.. As a child, Pitera had been a huge fan of the 1966 The Green Hornet television show and actor Bruce Lee, triggering his lifelong interest in martial arts. After winning an arduous kumite competition in Sheepshead Bay, Pitera spent 27 months in Japan training assiduously under the revered Hiroshi Masumi. He was trained to use the tonfa, nunchucks and katanas. While in Japan, he grew his hair down to his shoulders to adopt the Bruce Lee image. After his scholarship ended, he sought work in a chopsticks factory to underwrite his stay and earn more money. This led him to acquire the nickname \\"Tommy Karate\\" by friends and fellow mobsters. Upon returning to Brooklyn, Pitera joined the Bonanno crime family and quickly became one of their most feared soldiers. He belonged to a Bonnano faction headed by caporegimes Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato, Frank Lino, Dominick Trinchera and Philip Giaccone. This group opposed the current leadership under boss Philip Rastelli and his leading capos Joseph Massino and Dominick Napolitano. In 1981, Massino and Napolitano set up the murders of the three rival capos in a Gravesend club co-owned by Sammy Gravano. After their deaths, Massino made peace with the rest of the leaderless faction, including Pitera. During the 1980s, Pitera became a \\"made man\\" of the Bonanno family and was assigned to Lino's crew by Bonnano consigliere Anthony Spero. Criminal career On August 29, 1988, Pitera allegedly ambushed and murdered Wilfred \\"Willie Boy\\" Johnson as he walked ahead to their car. Johnson had been a longtime associate and driver for Gambino family boss John Gotti. The hit was reportedly delegated to Pitera and fellow gunman Vincent \\"Kojak\\" Giattino after Gotti had discovered that Johnson had been a government informant since 1966. Pitera was charged with the Johnson murder but acquitted at trial. Pitera was close to Spero, whose Bath Beach crew were involved in extortion, loan sharking, drug dealing and murder, as well as robbing drug dealers and then reselling their product. Pitera's associates, Lloyd Modell and Frank Martini, murdered two Colombian dealers and stole sixteen kilograms of cocaine. The killers intended to drive their car to Staten Island to bury the bodies, but as they could not drive a stick shift, they left the car with the bodies inside the trunk in a Brooklyn parking garage. Modell used one of Pitera's guns in the murder and threw it in the harbor, angering him. Pitera killed Tala Siksik, a Middle Eastern drug supplier, in his Brooklyn apartment. Pitera shot Siksik four times in the back, chopped the body up into six pieces, and then buried it at a secret dumping ground. Investigators eventually found six of Pitera's victims in a mob graveyard in Staten Island near the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. Pitera had decapitated the bodies and buried the heads separately to impede their identification using dental records. Pitera's approach to murder and body disposal was cold-hearted and clinical. He used the Staten Island graveyard because he believed that the damp soil would accelerate decomposition and the wildlife refuge would ensure the bodies were not discovered during construction projects. Pitera studied books on dissection and carried a special tool kit for cutting up bodies. He always insisted on burying corpses deep enough so that police dogs could not locate their scents. Before burying body parts, he either wrapped them in plastic or placed them in suitcases. Pitera's weakness was that he enjoyed keeping jewelry and other souvenirs of his work. This went beyond Mafia culture and was classic serial killer behavior. On June 4, 1990, Pitera was indicted for heading a drug dealing crew and for his involvement in seven murders, including the 1988 Johnson murder. Investigators alleged that Pitera had been involved in as many as sixty murders. Pitera's crew sold about 220 pounds of cocaine per year, multiple kilos of heroin and hundreds of pounds of marijuana. FBI agents discovered more than sixty automatic weapons, knives, swords, and literature such as The Hitman's Handbook and Kill or Be Killed, which dealt primarily with assassination techniques as well as torture and the dismemberment of cadavers, in Pitera's apartment in Gravesend. Trial One of Pitera's crew members, Frank Gangi, the nephew of Genovese family capo Rosario Gangi, decided to testify against Pitera. Frank had been arrested for driving under the influence and allegedly started reliving Pitera's worst atrocities in his mind while sitting in the holding cell. Frank confessed to all the murders he was involved in with Pitera, and provided information on other Pitera murders. He described how Pitera matter-of-factly assassinated Gangi's girlfriend Phyllis Burdi while she was passed out in bed after sharing cocaine and sex with Gangi. Pitera then cut Burdi's corpse into six pieces in the bathroom. Gangi also testified that during a fight with a drug dealer named Marek Kucharsky, Pitera pulled a knife and repeatedly stabbed Kucharsky and finally cut his throat. Also, author Philip Carlo writes that Shlomo Mendelsohn an Israeli drug dealer said the bodies were buried on Staten Island or New Jersey. In Pitera's trial, the chief prosecutor, David W. Shapiro, demanded the death sentence for the \\"heinous, cruel and depraved\\" murders committed by Pitera. He called Pitera a \\"heartless and ruthless killer,\\" explaining in detail how Pitera tortured one victim by slowly, deliberately shooting him seven times in various parts of the body, in one of a series of murders carried out in a deliberately barbaric manner. The prosecution also produced a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent who testified to digging up graves containing the dismembered bodies of some of Pitera's victims. Pitera's defense lawyer, David A. Ruhnke, urged the jury to reject the death penalty on the grounds that Pitera had no prior criminal record and that other participants in the murders were allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges. Moreover, only two of the murder victims, Richard Leone and Solomon Stern, were killed on March 15, 1989, after the Federal death penalty law went into effect. The four other murders took place earlier, so those counts carried maximum sentences of life in prison. Pitera's aunt, sister-in-law and two cousins testified on Pitera's defense that he was a loving and caring family member. Life sentence On June 25, 1992, Pitera was convicted of murdering six people and supervising a massive drug dealing operation in Brooklyn. However, Pitera was acquitted in the 1988 Johnson murder. During the deliberation on sentencing, the jury rejected the death penalty for Pitera. In October 1992, alluding to evidence that Pitera brutally killed his victims and dismembered their bodies, Judge Reena Raggi sentenced him to life in prison, saying, \\"Mr. Pitera, nobody deserves to die as these people died.\\" After the verdict was read, Pitera smiled and gave a thumbs up to reporters sitting in the Brooklyn courtroom; he had avoided the death penalty. However, Pitera was irritated that Gangi was petitioning Judge Raggi for a reduction of his 10-year prison sentence. As Pitera later remarked, > Gangi said he was sorry about killing five people and that he became an > informer because he wanted to start a new life. He gets 10 years, a good > deal, and he goes whimpering and weeping to the judge looking for a break. > If you're really sorry for killing five people, you take your punishment > like a man. Later in 1992, Judge Raggi again refused a motion to reduce Gangi's sentence. On April 3, 2012, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied Pitera's motion for DNA testing of the guns and other evidence in three of Pitera's murders. As of April 2017, Pitera is serving a life sentence at the United States Penitentiary, McCreary near Pine Knot, Kentucky. Pitera's inmate number is 29465-053.

It was on his orders the houses were moved, brick by brick, to their current location. The house, originally built by the St John- Mildmays in 1727, was Reeds School in the mid-1900s and later became the Noviciate and house of studies for the De La Salle Order, a Roman Catholic institute of teaching Brothers. After they left the site, it was partially burned down, the remainder falling into disrepair. It was subsequently restored and enlarged, and then occupied by both the Amdahl Corporation and then Systems Union. Engraving of Dogmersfield Park, after drawing by Neale (1818) Following the De La Salle ownership of the house it was sold to the Vallance family, the owners of Daneshill School, who relocated from its previous home in Old Basing, at Daneshill House. Owing to increasingly stringent fire safety regulations and market forces it became uneconomic to accommodate boarders in the main house and smaller premises were sought. The house was both a family home and a school. The property was sold on to an investor who had the intention of opening a health farm; however, this never happened owing to a devastating fire that took place in 1981. The new owners completed renovations, setting up the manor for office use. They sold the property in 1996 and it was again up for sale in 2000. Since spring 2005, after completion of a major renovation, the manor, on 500 acres, has operated as the Four Seasons Hotel Hampshire.

According to New York University records, it ceased to exist around the 1940s. The society was dedicated to furthering the literary arts. Members held hour-long debates, preceded by readings of essays, orations, and poems. The Eucleian Society published orations and poems delivered by guest speakers at annual or anniversary meetings. In the 20th century, the Eucleians published three literary magazines: The Knickerbocker, The Medley, and The Geyser. Origins Eucleian Meeting Parlor, 1830s In 1832 sixteen students began the Eucleian Society at New York University, originally under the name \\"Adelphic Society\\". After debate the name Eucleian was chosen in honor of Eukleia- Œµ·ΩîŒ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ±, the Goddess of Repute, Glory and War, associated with Artemis, the Goddess of the Hunt and protector of women and children.Athenian Political Art from the Fifth and Fourth Centuries BCE: Images of Political Personifications The society had as a rival, the Philomathean Society at New York University. While both societies forbade membership in their rival society, early records show that members were sometimes punished when discovered to be holding mutual membership and a few resigned to join the rival society. During the period of its founding, student societies such as Eucleian Society collected their own libraries and augmented their instruction by employing the noted minds of their day. Literary and debate societies offered a departure from the learn-by-rote instruction that prevailed in much of university instruction. Benefiting from a trust formed by A. Ogden Butler and family, the organization had a stable source of funding. The Eucleian Society provided its membership at NYU with a library and augmented student instruction. The University gave the society its own rooms at the Main University Building. The Eucleian Meeting Parlor was said to be \\"fitted up in a style of taste and elegance highly creditable to the young gentlemen members.\\" Culture Eucleian and Philomathean joint meeting, Edgar Allan Poe as lecturer 1840s On occasion Eucleians hosted open forums for important topics of the day, inviting lecturers of great popularity and fame. Edgar Allan Poe, who lived in New York City, was a guest reciter at at least one Eucleian and Philomathean society joint meeting.175 Facts About NYUE. A. Poe Society of Baltimore Politics, current affairs, literature (especially the Gothic and Romantic popular in the era), and university events seems to have been the most popular topics for internal essays, orations and discussions. Until the turn of the 20th century, officers of the Eucleians also gave public speeches at commencement, apparently occupying a central position in those functions. In the 20th century, the Eucleians published three literary magazines: The Knickerbocker, The Medley, and The Geyser. The Knickerbocker, although bearing the same title as the commercial magazine The Knickerbocker launched in 1833, was a student magazine launched in the turn of the 20th century and apparently only published twice, March 1900 and January 1901.http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/archives/eucleian/bioghist.html In the late 1930s and 1940s the society became increasingly separate from the university despite having on-campus accommodations. Numbers in the organization dwindled in the 1940s as a result of World War II. Another cause for Eucleian‚Äôs lower profile seems to have been the perception of elitism by other NYU students. A quip in a yearbook of the era describes Eucleian as having membership that includes ‚ÄúJohn Quincy Adams, The Rockefellers, and that crowd‚Äù. (The organization did consist largely of the social \\"elite\\" of the time.) This alleged snobbery also became a theme of self-effacing humor in the diminishing external publications of the society in this era; the society refers to itself, and presumably Andiron Club as \\"the reclusive old Establishment\\" in a 1930s NYU yearbook. This tongue-in-cheek reference had to do with the club not taking part as a unit in spirited student games, competitions and hazing of freshmen that occurred in the early fall at NYU. According to New York University records, the Eucleian Society ceased to exist around the 1940s. In 2017, the society was revived by MFA graduates of the NYU Creative Writing Program, with the premise of continuing the tradition of intellectual exploration and literary discussion in an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere.

He was involved in the Freeman Field Mutiny, and he was active member in the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. Goodall attended the University of Detroit. He joined the Tuskegee airmen in Pasadena. Although Goodall was a Tuskegee Airmen, he did most of his training at Selfridge Field with the rest of the 477th medium bomber group. As an African American he faced a lot of racism. He overcame this to become a pilot. After his training he was assigned to the 477th Bombardment Group. It was at that Group that the mutiny occurred. The Freeman Field mutiny was a culmination of many events that were caused by racism. The first was the switch from the 477th home base to a much smaller and less well-equipped base. The second being the racist commander not allowing blacks and whites to talk to each other, and the third not allowing the black officer into the officer club. This then led to 162 black officers walking into the club and then being arrested. Eventually they were acquitted. The B25 The 477th was a medium bomber group, and like most medium bomber groups of their day they flew the B-25 Mitchell. The B-25 is a twin engine medium bomber that was manufactured by North American Aviation. North American Aviation Inc. was founded on December 6, 1928 by Clement Keys as a holding company that bought and sold interests in various airlines and aviation- relation companies. However, the Air Mail Act of 1934 forced the breakup of such companies. So in order to continue business North American Aviation started building planes for the war effort. North American Aviation was responsible for a number of historic aircraft like the P-51 Mustang, F-86 Sabre Jet, the Apollo Command and Service Module as well as the B-25. Despite all of this company‚Äôs glory, North American Aviation was bought out in December 1996 by Boeing. Although this company no longer exists North American Aviation was responsible for many of our countries greatest aircraft. The B-25 was a major factor throughout World War II. In both the Pacific and the European theater the B-25 was used to great effect. Throughout history the B-25‚Äôs are famous for two main things: *The first is the famous Doolittle Raid. These Raids took place during April 1942. These raids were led by the legendary LT. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, who took off from the carrier USS Hornet and successfully bombed Tokyo and four other Japanese cities. However 15 of the 16 planes crash landed in Eastern China due to lack of fuel. *The other incident is more infamous than famous. This event occurred on Saturday, July 28, 1945 at 9:49 a.m. This is when a B-25 was flying through thick fog and then crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building. This crash happened between the 79th and 80th floor and was responsible for the lives of fourteen people. However this event led to one of the more famous survival stories. This occurred when an elevator‚Äôs cables snapped at the 75th floor and the elevator operator plunged over a thousand feet and lived. Now lets talk about the B-25 from a more technical side. The B-25 Mitchell is a twin engine medium bomber and the B-25 had two Wright R-2600-13 Double Cyclone fourteen- cylinder air-cooled radials, rated at 1700 hp each for takeoff and 1500 hp at 2400 rpm. Equipped with Holley 1685HA carburetors or Bendix Stromberg carburetors. The B-25 is named after General Billy Mitchell and is the only American military aircraft named after a specific person. The B-25 can be flown by a six-person crew. The B-25 has multiple turrets. The plane has one in the front or also known as the bombardier‚Äôs compartment and there is also another turret known as the upper turret. Then there is another turret that is in the radio operator's compartment and the gunner is known as the waist gunner. Then the last turret is in the tail and the gunner is known as the tail gunner. Another important bit of information is that each turret had at least two 50 caliber machine guns and each gun ammo capacity was from three hundred to four hundred rounds. Also this plane can deliver up to 4,000 pounds (1800 kg) of bombs and some could carry 8 √ó 5 in (127 mm) high velocity aircraft rockets. Besides firepower the B-25's had some pretty good armor. The B-25's were equipped with ¬º inch (6 mm) armor along the bombardier compartment, the pilot compartment and the upper turret. Then the rest of the plane had 3/8 inch (10 mm) armor around most of the hull, but an interesting note is that there is ¬Ω inch armor behind the tail gunner that was used to protect the tail gunner from the upper turret gunner. (Heavenly Body) The B-25 has a wingspan 67 feet 6.7 inches, length 53 feet 5.75 inches (bomber version), height 16 feet 4.2 inches, wing area . (Heavenly Body) The plane has a normal operating weight of 33,000 pounds (15,000 kg) but even though the plane is very heavy the plane has a cruising speed of and that plane has a range of 1275 miles.(Heavenly Body) The B-25 was so useful that it was used by the Army, Air force and the Navy. This plane was also used by Australia, the United Kingdom, China, The Netherlands and the Soviet Union. The 447th As was stated earlier the 477th was activated January 15, 1944 and they were a group of medium bombers that flew the B-25 Mitchell. The 477th was an all- black fleet. The 477th started out with many problems, one being that the Army Air Force did not establish schools to train African-Americans in the arts of navigation and bombardment until well into the war. Although the 477th was short of navigators and bombers, that group did have pilots. Many of these pilots were former Tuskegee Airmen who were ready to return to combat. Although the 477th was short on crew, they had more important problems. > The 477th, moreover, was born under a cloud, Army Air Forces Commanding > General Henry H. (Hap) Arnold tried to abort the unit before it was born. > The 477th also had the misfortune to be assigned to a numbered Air Force > (1st Air Force) that was commanded by an ardent racial segregationist, Major > General Frank O. Hunter. He saw his role throughout the entire history of > the 477th not as one of preparing a unit for combat in a war with great > stakes. Rather, he perceived his function as barring the Tuskegee Airmen > from any respect from its leaders. Worse, and more importantly, he agreed to > the illegal humiliation of the Tuskegee Airmen. Colonel Robert E. Selway, without any advance notice to his men, ordered that people of the 477th to board trains to move to an unknown location. Selway was concerned about race tensions in Detroit that had never affected his unit and despite the pressures of preparing a unit that he would lead into combat, moved the unit to Godman Army Air Field near Fort Knox, Kentucky. This base was completely inadequate for the 477th. Selfridge had four times more hangar space the Godman, seven times the area, five times the aviation gasoline capacity, more runways, and better flying weather. More to the point, Godman could not house the entire group at one time because the field had inadequate apron and hangar space. The move was bad and it was done for racial reasons. The move seriously delayed the 477th training program and damaged morale.\\" The 477th was at the undersized Godman Field from May 5, 1944 to March 1, 1945, but this was soon followed by an act of mutiny. The Freemen Field mutiny occurred on March 10, 1945.(AFRO-American Almanac) The mutiny was a culmination of years of racism and hate, and the worst thing was that all of this hate was condoned by General Hunter. Hunter himself gave this racist briefing. > \\"The War Department is not ready to recognize blacks on the level of social > equal to white men. This is not the time for blacks to fight for equal > rights or personal advantages. They should prove themselves in combat first. > There will be no race problem here, for I will not tolerate any mixing of > the races. Anyone who protests will be classed as an agitator, sought out, > and dealt with accordingly. This is my base and, as long as I am in command, > there will be no social mixing of the white and colored officers. The single > Officers Club on base will be used solely by white officers. You colored > officers will have to wait until an Officers Club is built for your use. Are > there any questions? If there are, I will deal with them > personally.\\"(General Hunter) Although the black officers were not allowed to enter the officers quarters since they were deemed trainees, the black officers got their own club. > \\"The 477th were not happy nor fooled by the existence of two clubs. They > named their club \\"Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin\\" and refused to use it. Then on March > 10, 1945, resistance to the racial policy's of the club situation began when > two groups of black officers (14 in all) entered the white officers‚Äô club > and ordered drinks and cigarettes. They were refused service and departed > without incident, but the visit caused great concern in the all-white > command structure of the 477th.\\" then the real trouble started. On April 5, 1945 the great mutiny occurred. This happened when the last of the troops at Godman were relocated to Freeman. Then when they got there 162 of the black officers calmly walked into the white officers club a few at a time and they were all put under house arrest as they entered(Freeman Field Mutiny) and quote by Oliver Goodall himself > \\"It was unconstitutional, and I wasn't going to take it. We decided to walk > into the officers club, and 162 of us were put under house arrest. When the > war ended, they wanted to get rid of us, and they started with the > troublemakers, which included me.\\"(Oliver Goodall) See also *B-25 Mitchell *Freeman Field Mutiny *North American Aviation *Selfridge Field *Tuskegee Airmen References *477 bomber group.

The village grew up around a large property called \\"Rusthall\\" located on Rusthall Common. Rusthall is a modern village, the majority built after the trains arrived in Royal Tunbridge Wells during the mid-1800s. It was created as a tourist spot, with visitors coming up from the station in charabancs to see the 'Toad Rock', a natural rock formation which looks like a sitting toad, resting on an outcrop of sandstone. Other outcrops can be seen throughout Rusthall Common. History The first known mention of Rusthall and Speldhurst is in a grant of lands by Ecgberht II, an Anglo-Saxon or Jutish king of Kent, to Diora, Bishop of Rochester in the 8th century., Rusthall Local History Group. During the 17th century, lodging houses appeared in Rusthall to accommodate visitors to the newly discovered chalybeate spring at The Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells. During the reign of King Charles I, Rusthall tended to attract visitors from the Puritan faction, whilst the Cavalier faction tended to stay at nearby Southborough.Melville, L (1912): Society at Tunbridge Wells in the 18th Century. London: Eveleigh Nash (available at www.theweald.org) The name \\"Rusthall\\" is from the Anglo-Saxon Ruste uuelle, meaning the well contains a high level of natural iron like the chalybeate springs in Tunbridge Wells. Following the end of the English Civil War, a time during which the Puritans took a hostile attitude to most forms of amusement, the waters at Tunbridge Wells became popular once more, and further accommodation houses were provided in Rusthall. The village also gained an assembly room and bowling green, to provide amusement for visitors, making it a more popular destination than Southborough, which could only offer a bowling green and coffee house. During the 18th century, Rusthall fell out of favour, following the emergence of Tunbridge Wells town, which could now offer ample accommodation closer to the waters. Following this shift in popularity, some Rusthall houses, which had been built on moveable sledges, were wheeled to be relocated to the more fashionable Mount Sion area of Tunbridge Wells.] Jeremy Menuhin, son of Yehudi Menuhin, was the previous Lord of the Manor of Rusthall. In early 2008 this title, along with the common land and the Pantiles in Tunbridge Wells was purchased by TargetFollow, a property development company based in Norwich. Cold water baths Rusthall, which derived its name from the rusty nature of the local water, also had its own wells known locally for their curative powers. A cold water bath house used to be situated on the south side of Rusthall Common, in the grounds of what is now the Beacon Hotel. The bath waters were known for their coldness and the clearness of the water which were observed to be \\"as excellent as any in the kingdom\\".Clifford, J. (1834) The Tunbridge Wells Guide, or an account of the ancient and present state of that place The baths were designed as a place of entertainment, the grounds being embellished with fountains and ornaments. Despite these attractions, the baths waned in popularity by the end of the 18th century and fell into a state of decay. The foundations of the cold bath house are still present today. Government Rusthall originally formed part of Speldhurst civil parish (together with Ashurst, Groombridge, Langton and Speldhurst) when it was formed in 1894. Four years later, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council took control over Rusthall, apparently against the parish council's wishes, and the village formed part of the unparished Tunbridge Wells urban area between 1898 and 2011. On 23 February 2011, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council agreed that Rusthall should become a civil parish and have its own parish council. The first Rusthall Parish Council election took place on 5 May 2011.Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, accessed 25 February 2011. Having chaired the Rusthall Village Association for a number of years, Cllr. Jenny Blackburn was elected as chair of Rusthall Parish Council on 18 May 2011. The two current Tunbridge Wells Borough Councillors representing Rusthall ward are Councillor Joy Podbury (Con) and Councillor Thelma Huggett (Con). The local Member of Parliament for the Tunbridge Wells constituency is Greg Clark MP (Con). Demographics At the 2011 UK census, the Rusthall electoral ward had a population of 4,976 in 2,076 households. Geography Rusthall is located just under west of Tunbridge Wells town centre, and is separated from the built-up area of Tunbridge Wells by Rusthall Common and the Tunbridge Wells Golf Club. The village is around south-east of London. Toad Rock Toad Rock, Rusthall Rusthall and the surrounding area features several sandstone outcrops. One of these formations, located in the Denny Bottom area, close to Rusthall Common, is known as Toad Rock because it resembles a sitting toad. The first known record of the rock's name is in an 1823 guide by J. Clifford, although the rock itself was first popularised in a local guide published in 1810.Tunbridge Wells Commons Conservators The fencing around the rock's base was first installed in 1881-2 and has since been renovated in 1993‚Äì94. The rock formation is not man-made, as was at first suspected, but was eroded into its current shape by wind action during the Ice Age. The area has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Rusthall Common forms an element in the 'green link' under the Tunbridge Wells Borough Council Green Infrastructure Plan, 2011 that provides a wildlife corridor linking the park to the Common, Great Culverden Park and other local wildlife sites. Culture and community Culture The village fete returned in 2010, for the first time since 1977.Rusthall Village Association It is held on the playing fields at Southwood Road and features a variety of stalls and events. Every October, the village hosts a torchlit procession, bonfire and fireworks night. The bonfire is built up throughout the day by villagers. High Street, restaurants and pubs Rusthall has a thriving High Street featuring an unusually wide variety of services for a village of its size. These include two convenience stores, post office, butcher, baker, hardware shop, dry cleaner, therapy clinic/health food shop, hair salon, pet shop, launderette, pharmacy, beauty salon, barber, audio-visual shop, charity shop, bookmaker and, last but by no means least, estate agent. Restaurant and take-away options include Chinese, fish and chips, bistro style caf√©s and pizza, as well as a traditional \\"greasy spoon\\" caf√©. Pubs in the village include the historic Red Lion (first licensed in 1415), The Oak, The White Hart, Toad Rock Retreat and The Beacon, renowned for its captivating views of the High Weald. There is also The Rusthall Social Club. School, healthcare and churches Rusthall St Paul's CE Primary School is located on the High Street. Rusthall Medical Centre is nearby, on Nellington Road. Rusthall Dental Practice is on Meadow Road. St. Paul's Church, built in 1849, is on Rusthall Road, just off the Tunbridge Wells-Langton Green road (A264). Rusthall United Reformed Church is on Manor Road, off the High Street. The former Rusthall Evangelical Church is on Westwood Road. The building was opened in 1913 and is currently used for youth work. Sport and recreation Rusthall Football Club, founded in 1899, plays in the Kent Invicta Football League (Step 6 of the FA Non-League Pyramid/Level 10). The club was granted senior status in April 2012. Rusthall Cricket Club has been playing cricket on Rusthall Common since the mid 19th Century. The club runs a Saturday side playing friendlies. Rusthall Common separates the village from the main built up area of neighbouring Tunbridge Wells and is characterised by sandstone outcrops, with names such as Toad Rock, the Elephant, the Lion, Loaf Rock and The Parson's Nose. Southwood Road Recreation Ground features an adventure playground, a BMX track, mini-skate park, two full-sized football pitches and one mini football pitch. Southwood Road allotments are located next to the recreation ground. A smaller playground, Mary Caley Recreation Ground, can be found on Ashley Gardens road. Rusthall Amateur Boxing Club. A small hut next to the Rusthall library is home to Rusthall & Tunbridge Wells ABC Transport Rusthall is connected to Tunbridge Wells and High Brooms by the frequent 281 bus service operated by Arriva Southern Counties. There is no railway line serving Rusthall, although the 281 bus service links the village to Tunbridge Wells main-line station for direct services to London, Tonbridge and Hastings.

They have released four albums and multiple Christmas singles.  Background  The group started as a one-man project with all the instruments and vocals on the debut album Theocracy performed by Smith. Musically, the band mixes the power metal style of Edguy, Iced Earth, and Helloween with progressive influences from bands such as Dream Theater, Symphony X, Kansas and Rush. The group performed at the ProgPower USA VII festival Pre-Party in Atlanta, Georgia. Live performances from the show of the songs \\"The Serpent's Kiss\\" and \\"Mountain\\" were included on the ProgPower VII DVD. The band's self-titled album was released on January 1, 2003 by MetalAges Records. All instruments were played by Matt Smith. The album had been out of print for several years, and fans have asked for a re-issue. In order to improve upon the drum machine and amateur production of the original release without losing the charm of the recordings, Theocracy drummer Shawn Benson recorded drums on all tracks, while nothing else was re-recorded. Smith completely re-mixed the album, with the mastering handled by Mika Jussila, and on November 19, 2013, Ulterium Records re-released it. Their second album, Mirror of Souls, was Theocracy's first album as a full band. It was released on November 21, 2008 through Sweden's Ulterium Records and on November 26, 2008 in Japan by Soundholic Records.

Inner tubing, tobogganing and other snow sports are on a maintained to hill of snow, popular with young children and families. It was established in 1952 as Mount Hood's first snow play area for children. History The East Leg Timberline Road‚Äîthe road through Snow Bunny‚Äîwas the original road to Timberline Lodge since its construction in 1936. In 1949, Timberline Highway opened and obsoleted winter use of East Leg Road and the Timberline Lodge garage at its foot at Route 26\\\\. In 1952, George W. Jackson led about 150 volunteers from East Side Commercial Club to convert the garage to a snow lodge intended as a safe place for children away from congested and dangerous ski areas. The lodge opened February 1, 1953, with meals, a children's playroom, and warming rooms on weekends during snow months. The Commercial Club sponsored a nonprofit organization called Snow Bunny Lodge Incorporated that operated the lodge from 1977 until 1992. During the week, it was available for youth groups. The lodge also offered overnight accommodations for up to 66 people, while it could hold 300 during the daytime. In the early 1990s plans were made to renovate the lodge. The building had developed dry rot, plus the fire suppression system was inadequate and the building contained the known carcinogen asbestos. The U.S. Forest Service received a federal grant of $250,000 to remodel the structure, but returned the grant after estimates for repair exceeded $700,000. In October 1992, the Forest Service tore down the lodge due to those safety concerns and burned the remnants. The non-profit group operating the tubing area, which is on public land, stopped operating the area when the lodge was demolished, but Northwest Nordic acquired a lease from the Forest Service in 1992 and began operating Snow Bunny. At that time the area drew 25,000 visitors each year. Operations Snow Bunny's elevation of makes it a popular trailhead for cross country skiers (nordic skiing), snowshoers and snowmobilers. This includes access to Trillium Lake and the Yellowjacket Trail. The facility is operated by the company that runs the Summit Ski Area (Northwest Nordic) located 2 miles west on U.S. Route 26. It is located along the Mount Hood Scenic Byway, about east of Government Camp on U.S. Route 26, near the junction with the Trillium Lake road (NFS 2656) and East Leg Road which connects to Timberline Highway, near the junction with Oregon Route 35.See Google maps for Neither forest road is plowed, making them popular winter sports choices.

Waldo was born in Arcade, N.Y. but spent his childhood in Plainwell, Michigan. Waldo was elected principal of WMU on April 1, 1904. He served as president from 1904 through 1936. When Western Michigan first opened, it was known as the Western State Normal School and later as the Western State Teachers College. One of Waldo's first moves, creating a rural school department, cemented WMU as a teaching college. It was the first such department in the nation and prepared teachers to effectively educate students in rural parts of America. Waldo also firmly believed in diversity on campus, and during his tenure many females and minorities were given the opportunity to attend the college. In the beginning Western Michigan served as a two-year normal school, but under Waldo's guidance it was soon structured into a four- year teachers college. He also served as one of the first instructors at WMU. Waldo is credited with keeping WMU open when many government officials wanted to shut it during the Great Depression. The school's football stadium (Waldo Stadium) and library (Waldo Library) are named in his honor. In 1912, Kalamazoo College awarded Waldo a Doctor of Laws as an honorary degree for his accomplishments at WMU. In 1932, Michigan State University awarded Waldo an honorary Doctor of Letters. Waldo was born in Arcade, New York, son of Simeon Smith Waldo and Martha Ann Bryant Waldo, during the final year of the Civil War. He and his family moved to Plainwell, Michigan in about 1874. Waldo graduated from Plainwell High School and Albion College. He married first Minnie Strong (children: Herbert (born 1894) and Ruth (born 1895)) and after Minnie's death, he married Eliza Lilian Trudgeon on September 14, 1904 (children: Elizabeth (born 1908), Barbara (born 1911) and Dorothy (born 1919)). Waldo and \\"Jimmy Boy\\" Waldo was noted for his interest and research into the life of Abraham Lincoln. His personal collection of Lincoln memorabilia is one of many displays at Waldo Library. A WMU librarian and Dwight Waldo Historian stated, \\"Waldo's vision, 'tough love' leadership style and unique combination of pragmatism and idealism are legendary around campus and Kalamazoo\\". Waldo had a pet parrot named \\"Jimmy Boy.\\" Despite claims that he walked around campus with the parrot, there is no evidence of this. Prior to assuming his leadership role at Western Michigan, Waldo was the first principal at Northern State Normal School (now Northern Michigan University) where he served from 1899 to 1904, and additionally served as the Department Chair of the History Department. 100 years after Waldo came to Western Michigan another Northern Michigan president, Judith Bailey, would follow in his footsteps to help Western Michigan kick off its \\"Centennial Campaign\\" after arriving in 2003. Waldo was also a history and economics teacher at Albion College before becoming principal at Northern State.

The station was originally part of the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway before passing to the Glasgow and South- Western Railway, then the London, Midland and Scottish upon grouping and closing under British Railways. Passenger services to Muirkirk station ceased in 1951. History The station is recorded as having opened on 9 August 1848, and closed on 3 July 1950 however the line remained in use until 6/12/1976 serving a colliery at Gasswater near Cronberry. In 1857 four rows of miners cottages were located near the railway, namely Commondyke, Dyke, High and Low In the 1895 OS map the rows are still present under the name Birnieknowe with a Roman Catholic religious community established composing St Patrick's Chapel, a convent, a presbytery and a school. By 1908 the name Birnieknowe applies to the religious community and Commondyke is used for the rows. The evidence from OS maps and the G&SWR; working time table of 1898 shows that a station was not actually established until sometime after 1898 with only a signal cabin present at that time. when the existence of a Roman Catholic school which had around 150 pupils at one time would have created a demand and need beyond that of the mining community and other locals who did not have sufficient earnings for regular use of the railway other than essential journeys and could have walked to Lugar station. Birnieknowe school remained open until around 1965. A basic timetable existed of four trains a day in each direction and more at weekends. Infrastructure The site of the southern platform with the old passenger ramp. The line opened as single track however the extent of the freight traffic necessitated doubling. Commondyke station had two platforms without any freight facilities of its own or any pointwork. A mineral line branched off to the north to a group of collieries in the vicinity of Darnconner. The line was once crossed to the east by a waggonway from the Lugar ironworks running to the Darnconner area and another freight branch from a west facing junction ran to collieries to the north, later re-aligned so as to run more directly to the Lugar Ironworks. Although recorded as having opened in 1848 the 1857 OS map gives no indication of the existence of a station at Commondyke however Lugar station is marked a relatively short distance away. In 1895 the only suggestion of a station is the presence of two signal posts, one either side of the road bridge and a signal cabin on the southern side of the line. By 1908 the OS map shows that a station is present with the ticket office, shelters on both platforms, two buildings, one of which would have been a signal box and four signal posts. A path runs down to the southern platform from near the road over bridge. The ticket office in the London, Midland and Scottish Railway days of the 1940s was a small wooden building standing over the northern side of the cutting close to the bridge with a steep set of steps running down to the platform and reached by a footpath. A later photograph shows that at least one of the shelters had been removed. Micro-history A memorial cross stands in an open area to the north, visible from the road that records that 'AT THE DISTANCE OF EIGHT FEET IN FRONT OF THIS SPOT THE REV SISTER LAURIENNE WAS ACCIDENTALLY KILLED ON THE 8TH DAY OF AUGUST 1888'. 'BEHOLD', MY BELOVED SAITH UNTO ME, 'RISE UP, MAKE HASTE, MY LOVE, MY DOVE, MY FAIR ONE, AND COME AWAY'. The train driver of the 0-4-0 engine No.90 running from Muirkirk was Johnnie Goodfellow, a Presbyterian, is said to have lived in fear of his locomotive being derailed by the Catholic community as an act of revenge. The nun involved was deaf and had not heard a train coming on the old line to the north whilst out searching for a missing school pupil. Commondyke station had to be closed when Sister Laurienne's body was removed due to the throng of mourners trying to access the platform, thousands having attended the funeral. Advanced plans existed to re-open the line from Auchinleck to an open-cast mine at Powharnel near Cronberry however these were eventually abandoned following the decision to close Longannet Power Station.

From 1969 to 1995, Gill was a full-time staff member of the academy, where he held various positions throughout his tenure, including that of chairman for the Department of Ornithology and vice president for systematics and evolutionary biology. During his time at the academy, Gill was instrumental in reestablishing the academy's position as one of the leading centers of American ornithological research. This was manifested through Gill's work as the founding director of the VIREO program (Visual Resources for Ornithology) and his work as the editor of the encyclopedic series Birds of North America, Life Histories for the 21st Century. In 1988 he was awarded the Linnaean Society of New York's Eisenmann Medal. Since 1996, Gill has been affiliated with the academy as a research fellow. More recently, Gill was the president of the American Ornithologists' Union from 1998 to 2000. Besides his acclaimed textbook, Gill's published works include over 150 scientific and popular articles. His worldwide research programs included field studies of island birds, hybridization by blue-winged and golden-winged warblers, flower-feeding strategies of sunbirds of Africa and of hermit hummingbirds of Middle America, and phylogeny through DNA of the chickadees of the world. For his contributions to ornithology, Gill was recognized with the William Brewster Award, the highest honor bestowed by the AOU.The Auk, January 1999 Additionally, Gill is an elected member of the International Ornithological Congress, as well as the co-author, with Minturn Wright, of Birds of the World: Recommended English Names (2006). Since 1994 he has led the international effort to use a consistent set of unique English names and authoritative species taxonomy of the birds of the world. Gill's contributions include innovative program leadership combined with a personal commitment to engaging the public in ornithology through citizen science. He pioneered ‚Äúcyberbirding‚Äù‚Äîthe use of the internet for nationwide citizen science initiatives‚Äîincluding the conversion of classic Christmas Bird Count to modern technology. Frank and his colleagues at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology also were awarded US Patent No. 6,772,142 for their internet software application to translate online georeference data to an interactive database. With such tools, he and his colleagues created the Great Backyard Bird Count and then the eBird initiative of Audubon and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. In 1996, Gill became senior vice president and director of science for the National Audubon Society, a position from which he retired in 2004. At Audubon, he championed the nationwide Important Bird Areas initiative in partnership with BirdLife International. In 2007, he was elected to the board of directors of the National Audubon Society and served as interim president and CEO (2010). He has been quoted in a number of news reports concerning birds.Sightings spur rush to aid ‚Äòextinct‚Äô woodpecker, NBC News, April 28, 2005. Accessed December 28, 2007.

They feel that the church leadership has shifted or departed from key doctrinal \\"pillars\\" ever since the middle of the 20th century. Specifically, they point to the publication in 1957 of a book entitled Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine; which they feel undermines historic Adventist theology in favor of theology more compatible with evangelicalism. Historic Adventism has been erroneously applied by some to any Adventists that adhere to the teachings of the church as reflected in the church's fundamental beliefs such as the Sabbath or the Spirit of Prophecy. They misapply those who hold to mainstream traditional Adventist beliefs as synonymous with Historic Adventist. Historic Adventists have tended to promote their message through independent ministries, some of which have had a strained relationship with the official church.\\"Hope International and Hartland Institute are expressions of historic Adventism.\\"\\" Last Generation Theology\\" shares some elements with Historic Adventism, yet considers itself to have \\"expanded\\" the beliefs of Adventism to their logical conclusion.Interview with Larry Kirkpatrick by Julius Nam Historic Adventists are seen as at the opposite end of the Adventist theological spectrum from Progressive Adventists. Prominent figures supporting some of the historic views include M. L. Andreasen, and Colin and Russell Standish. History Teachings on Christian perfection and personal holiness were present in the religious revival of the Great Awakening in America and were evident in early Adventist movements such as the \\"Holy Flesh movement\\" in Indiana around the turn of the 19th century which Ellen White quickly rebuked.\\"2nd Selected Messages, pp. 36‚Äì38, Ellen White They were also evident in some teachings on holiness by medical doctor John Harvey Kellogg, and Jones and Waggoner of 1888 fame. Joseph Bates was one of the three primary founders of Seventh-day Adventism (along with James and Ellen White). Like many in the early church he focused more on following the requirements of God's law over salvation by grace.Benjamin McArthur, \\"Early Adventism's Leon Trotsky.\\" Spectrum 33:2 (Spring 2005); alternative link . A review of George R. Knight, Joseph Bates: The Real Founder of Seventh-day Adventism. Review and Herald, 2004 Following the 1919 Bible Conference, in which Ellen White's inspiration was discussed during two days, some defended against what they felt were attacks on her such as Holmes and Washburn, who wrote open letters decrying the alleged \\"new theology\\" and the \\"omega\\" apostasy of the Adventist church.http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/1919bc/hal-3.htm Keith Lockhart has described the \\"Golden Age\\" of Adventism (from a sociological point of view) as the fundamentalist era of the 1920s‚Äì1950s. It is to this time period the expression \\"historic Adventism\\" most accurately applies, not to 19th century Adventism. Along with Malcolm Bull, he says \\"Adventist fundamentalism\\" emerged in the 1880s, became dominant in the 1920s, and survives to the present day among conservative groups.\\" They also claim \\"elements of fundamentalism were re-invoked,\\" becoming discernible in the 1990s.Seeking a Sanctuary, p. 104 :\\"But what many authors take to be historic Adventism is in fact a creation of the twentieth century ‚Äî a synthesis that took place in the 1920s and remained dominant until the 1960s. It was, moreover, a synthesis that in itself represented an accommodation to the newly formed fundamentalist movement.\\"Bull and Lockhart, Seeking a Sanctuary, p90‚Äì91, as quoted elsewhere Adventist- Evangelical dialogues It is widely accepted that present historic Adventism emerged in response to the Adventist-Evangelical discussions that occurred in the spring of 1955 to the fall of 1957. These dialogues were initiated by evangelicals Donald Barnhouse and Walter Martin, who sought clarification on what Adventists believed and took issue with a number of teachings, which at the time were generally thought to characterize Adventist theology. The most significant of these being: semi-arian views on the GodHead; man's sinful nature taken by Christ in His incarnation; an incomplete atonement at the time of Christ's death on the cross; salvation by obedience to the law; and extreme sectarianism. At least one author considers the various streams existed earlier, as some Millerites came from churches holding Arian views, but this event polarized them.Lowell Tarling claims this The Adventist leaders who met with Walter Martin presented a fuller description of mainstream Adventist theology, and described the more fundamentalist views as merely the beliefs of a few. (Le Roy Edwin Froom described them as the \\"lunatic fringe.\\") In addition to showing it had clearly moved from semi-arian views on the GodHead, the Adventists asserted that the belief that Christ took Adam's sinful nature after the fall and an incomplete atonement were not part of mainstream Adventist doctrine. Adventist historian George Knight felt it was not a complete picture as it could be, because a majority of Adventists prior to 1950 had held to these teachings concerning the nature of Christ and the atonement.Questions on Doctrine: annotated edition 2005 Martin and Barnhouse were satisfied with the responses given by the Adventist delegation, and concluded that the Adventist church was a legitimate Christian body. Meanwhile, Adventist theologian M. L. Andreasen, who was aware of these proceedings, openly opposed what he felt was a change concerning the nature of Christ and the atonement and represented the many Adventists who held that view. (Those Adventists who believed Christ had taken a fallen nature still believed that Jesus was sinless and committed no actual sins, but they held that it included propensity or desire to sin). Some of these Adventists continue to oppose the theological direction taken by the church leadership on these issues and the more fundamentalist elements are known today as \\"Historic Adventists.\\" Herbert Douglass has stated, :\\"most, if not all, of the so-called 'dissident' or 'independent' groups of the last 45 years are direct results of the explicit and implicit positions espoused by [Questions on Doctrine] on the atonement and the Incarnation.\\"as quoted on http://qod.andrews.edu/index.html According to historian George Knight, :\\"Official Adventism may have gained recognition as being Christian from the evangelical world, but in the process a breach had been opened which has not healed in the last 50 years and may never heal.\\"George Knight, 2003 annotated edition of Questions on Doctrine  1970s  Desmond Ford convinced Robert Brinsmead his views on perfectionism were incorrect in about 1970. Robert Brinsmead himself however denies that Ford convinced him to abandon perfectionism and further states that he abandoned perfectionism as a result of his intensive study of the issues of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther, and justification by faith. During the 1970s, what is now the Adventist Review carried articles by editor Kenneth Wood and associate editor Herbert Douglass rejecting Questions on Doctrine and arguing for a final perfect generation.\\"Righteousness by Faith\\" entry in Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists by Gary Land The General Conference addressed this controversy over \\"righteousness by faith\\" by holding a conference in Palmdale, California in 1976. Ford was the \\"center of attention,\\" and the resulting document known as the \\"Palmdale Statement\\".Adventists: Heirs of the Reformation, chapter 1 of The Shaking of Adventism by Geoffrey J. Paxton However the controversy continued and critics of the \\"new theology\\" of Ford and others formed institutions to respond them. Julius Nam has written, :\\"However, the theological heirs of Andreasen have found such developments deeply troubling. Since 1971, several independent ministry groups have arisen within the Adventist church that have self- consciously embraced Andreasen's postlapsarian views and the accompanying theology of the final generation, which they believe is supported by the writings of Ellen White. Since their inception, these groups have warned against the evangelicalization of Adventism and have issued calls to the church at large to return to the Adventism of the pre-Questions on Doctrine era. Like Andreasen, they have seen the Adventist-evangelical conferences and the publication of Questions on Doctrine as the beginning of the end-time apostasy. From the perspective of these groups, the prelapsarian view advocated by Questions on Doctrine and embraced by many Adventists is another sign of the apostasy that continues in the church. They view Adventism as a movement that is to be deliberately separate from other groups such as evangelicals. Their vision of Adventism is a movement that is preparing the final generation of Christians who will ultimately overcome sin.\\" The 1975 book Perfection: The Impossible Possibility (Nashville: Southern Publishing Association, 1975) edited by Douglass, contained essays by Douglass and C. Mervyn Maxwell supporting traditional Adventist views, and Edward Heppenstall and Hans LaRondelle supporting their view. Theology Historic Adventist theology tends to differ from mainstream Adventist theology in the areas of Christology, hamartiology (sin), soteriology (salvation) and eschatology (end times). They often use the term \\"new theology\\" as a pejorative term for perceived doctrinal shifts in the church.e.g. With regards to Christology, according to Adventist historian George Knight, most early Adventists believed that Jesus Christ was born with a human nature that was not only physically frail and subject to temptation, but that he also had the fallen predisposition and inclination to sin.Questions on Doctrine, annotated edition, 2005. Since 1950, the \\"historic\\" wing of the church continues to hold this \\"fallen\\" view of Christ's human nature, though it is now a minority position among theologians and mainstream Adventism. Historic Adventists, like mainstream Adventists, believe that sin is defined in terms of personal transgressions of the commandments, over against an inborn corruption of the human nature inherited from Adam. Historic Adventists tend to place more emphasis on sanctification than justification. Following Andreasen, they define the atonement in terms of God's work to cleanse our character from sin as well as payment of the penalty for sin. The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary is regarded as a continuation of the work of atonement begun on the cross, rather than the application of the benefits of an already completed atonement. \\"Eschatological perfectionism\\" is the teaching that a final generation of believers must achieve a state of perfection or complete sinlessness in the final period just before the second coming of Jesus (see Last Generation Theology) and most Historic Adventists hold to that teaching. This belief in sinlessness arose particularly from M. L. Andreasen's interpretation of the investigative judgment doctrine, which is one of the pillars of Adventism and found in The Great Controversy by Ellen G. White. Historic Adventists generally place more emphasis on the writings of Ellen G. White as a doctrinal authority compared to mainstream Adventists, some considering her writings as infallible and having near-equivalent status to the Bible. Historic Adventists have a differing perspective on the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference arguing that Ellen White in addition to have supported Jones and Waggoner, but also perfectionistic theology, which some say came from them. Some historic Adventists, like many mainstream Adventists, are advocates of the King James Only movement, which promotes sole use of the King James Version of the Bible. (A classic book in this movement, Our Authorized Bible Vindicated (1930), was written by an Adventist, Benjamin G. Wilkinson. One critique is by Alden Thompson.Alden Thompson, critique (RTF). March 24, 1995)  Last Generation Theology  Last Generation Theology (LGT) or \\"final generation\\" theology is a belief system held by some conservative members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which claims that perfection like the 144,000 will be achieved by some people in the last generation before the Second Coming of Jesus. It is closely related to \\"historic Adventism,\\" but as one supporter claims, it differs in that it forms an extension or development of traditional Adventist beliefs, or takes them to their logical conclusion. Criticism Mainstream and progressive Adventists have criticised the use of the term \\"historic.\\" It is observed that numerous doctrinal positions that were common among the Adventist pioneers are generally not held by those who profess to be \\"historic Adventists,\\" such as semi-Arianism, what time of day the Sabbath should begin, certain understandings of Systematic Benevolence, the \\"shut door,\\" and the personhood of the Holy Spirit. It is argued that the over-valuing of \\"historic\\" beliefs leads to an unhelpful neglect of \\"new light\\" and \\"present truth,\\" which Adventists have always held as defining beliefs. Walter Martin labeled most of the historic Adventists he encountered as \\"legalists,\\" \\"worshippers of Ellen White\\" and the \\"lunatic fringe.\\"Walter Martin Interview, Adventist Currents, Vol. 1, No. 1, July, 1983, conducted by Douglas Hackleman. The term was earlier used by LeRoy Edwin Froom when Adventist leaders met with Martin.CRI Journal - CRJ0005B Adventist historian Milton Hook describes it as \\"Adventist fundamentalism.\\" He cites the aggressive preaching style of George Burnside who attacked Roman Catholics and \\"apostate\\" Protestants. Hook says this turned many away, and some of the remaining merely \\"loved a religious dogfight,\\" and converts \\"often generated dust storms of intolerance and became clones of militant dogmatism among their peers.\\" He states this style of evangelism was once the norm among Adventist preachers, and had roots in 19th century Methodism in the United States.

Article featured on magazine cover Historic Adventists look favorably on a past era of the church. Phil Dunham, a fairly conservative author himself, critiqued \\"nostalgia about the good old days of 'historic Adventism.' In some people's minds it seems to be a time of the most unblemished and unassailable doctrinal positions, the highest possible moral standards, the deepest spiritual maturity, the best snowlike purity, the utmost in readiness to be translated.[‚Ä¶] But the way we often use the expression 'historic Seventh-day Adventism' is built on an idealized and unrealistic notion of what our early church was really like.\\"Philip W. Dunham with Maylan Schurch, Blinded by the Light: The Anatomy of Apostasy. Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald, 2001, pp. 93‚Äì94 :\\"These days a lot of well-meaning people yearn for the supposedly purer days of the past. They feel that if they could just retrieve historic Seventh- day Adventism and bathe in its supposedly clearer waters, they'd be better able to resist last-day influences. :'Back then,' they assert, 'people had a higher level of spirituality ‚Äî and a lower rate of problems. Back then apostasy was somehow banned, or at least kept at bay.' :Not true. Not true for historic Seventh-day Adventism. Not true for the historic church of Christ ‚Äî the New Testament church. Not true for the seventh-day church in the wilderness‚Äîhistoric Judaism. Not true even for the First Church of Eden, because its entire two-member congregation ran and hid in naked apostasy. :No, you can't just change your group's name, or meet in a Grange Hall someplace, to escape apostasy. The seeds of apostasy grow not in a name or a place or a time ‚Äî but in the hearts of every person on this planet since Adam and Eve.[‚Ä¶]\\"Dunham, p. 67 billboard. Text reads, \\"SATURDAY the True Lord's Day Changed by Antichrist Responses to criticism In response, some historic Adventists have claimed that they are loving in their evangelism and deny that the charge of fanaticism applies to them. They quote statements by Ellen White to support their view. For instance: : \\"Men will misrepresent the doctrines we believe and teach as Bible truth, and it is necessary that wise plans should be laid to secure the privilege of inserting articles into the secular papers; for this will be a means of awakening souls to see the truth. God will raise up men who will be qualified to sow beside all waters. God has given great light upon important truths, and it must come to the world.\\"Ellen G. White, Letter 1, 1875. : \\"We must take every justifiable means of bringing the light before the people. Let the press be utilized, and let every advertising agency be employed that will call attention to the work. This should not be regarded as nonessential. On every street corner you may see placards and notices calling attention to various things that are going on, some of them of the most objectionable character; and shall those who have the light of life be satisfied with feeble efforts to call the attention of the masses to the truth?\\"Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 130.

The conclusion of the report stated that \\"by rejecting the authority of the world church in session when their interpretation of Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy differs from that of the church, Hope International and associates have set their authority above that of the world church and operate in a manner that is consistent with offshoot movements.\\" The report also contained a significant escalation: \\"If Hope International and associates cannot bring themselves into harmony with the body of the world church, clearly evidenced within 12 months, the Seventh- day Adventist Church may need to consider whether there exists a \\"persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted church authority or to submit to the order and discipline of the church\\" (Church Manual, p. 169).\\" According to one article, the policy of the Adventist church in North America is that members of Hartland or Hope International may not hold any church office.\\"Living with the Remnant \\" by Debra Lloyd Foote.

In addition, viewpoints similar to those of the Concerned Brethren were promulgated by a variety of independent groups.\\"Twenty-Five Years After Glacier View Adventist Today He has described them as \\"loyalists.\\"  Adventist Laymen's Fellowship  In 1978, in a conversation on a Newcastle beach (NSW, Australia) between Dr Colin Standish and an Adventist layman, Carl Branster, the issues that had developed over Desmond Ford's theology and the banning of the old pastors from Adventist pulpits, hatched the idea that these men should be given the chance to speak to the laity without the impediments applied by the official church. As a result, the Adventist Laymen's Fellowship (ALF) was founded to counter the growing Desmond Ford movement in Australia. ALF held a series of weekend meetings at Vision Valley (owned by the Wesley Mission) outside Sydney, to which local and overseas conservative Adventist speakers were invited to speak. The first weekend meeting was in November, 1978 and featured Dr Ralph Larson (then pastor of Campus Hill Church in Loma Linda, California), pastors JW Kent, Austin Cooke, George Burnside and Dr Colin Standish. Approximately 800 Adventists attended, part-emptying many Sydney SDA churches on the Sabbath. Attendees came from as far away as Queensland and Victoria. The initial ALF Committee members were Carl Branster, Nelson Haora, Dr David Pennington, Wal Hansen, Hal Reid, Llewellyn Jones jnr and Bill Turner, all laymen and most of whom were past or current elders in the SDA church. In order to maintain openness and a co-operative spirit with the official SDA church, the Greater Sydney Conference President was invited to attend all committee meetings. The president, in fact, did attend a number of those meetings. Later committee members were Marie Munro and David Black. Over several years, up to twice yearly public meetings were held at Vision Valley featuring local and overseas speakers, including Dr Colin Standish, Dr Mervyn Maxwell, Dr Leroy Moore, Dr Dennis Priebe and Charles Wheeling. Several of those weekend series were attended by over 1,000 people. The ALF also published a magazine for several years named 'Landmarks', edited by David Pennington. The ALF succumbed to theological unorthodoxy when the committee split over some of the prophetic interpretations of Charles Wheeling and disbanded about 1986.{personal communication, David Pennington} Publishing Historic Adventists have a strong commitment to publishing, and often disseminate free literature to promote their views to the mainstream church and wider public. * Our Firm Foundation\\"Hope International\\" in Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists by Gary Land, pp. 137‚Äì38 is a monthly magazine published by Hope International.

Blinder was born in Asunci√≥n into a Jewish family. She lived through the Chaco War, World War II, the 1947 Paraguayan Civil War, in addition to Paraguay's coup d'√©tats in 1954 and 1989. Blinder was also a licensed professor who taught arts and creative education for over 30 years. Her works include numerous published books and articles on education and art. She is the former director of the Escolinha de Arte of Paraguay in the Brazilian Cultural Mission and of the Instituto de Arte (ISA) of the National University of Asunci√≥n. She was also an advisor to the Ministry of Education for the development of textbooks. In addition, she has been recognized by the League of Women's Rights, by the Brazilian government, and received the Integraci√≥n Latinoamericana award from the Ministry of Culture and Education of Argentina. Blinder is considered one of the key promoters of change within the 1950s Paraguayan art scene.  Personal life  Olga Blinder was born into a Jewish family in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. As a child, her father was supportive of her art passion allowing her to draw and enrolling her in art classes. She lived during a time of political strife and upheaval that heavily influenced her view of the world and of society. At university she studied engineering and pedagogy at the Paraguay Atheneum. In 1943, Blinder married Dr. Isaac Schvartzman. The couple had three children named Silvia Susana, Carlos Eduardo, and Jorge Bernardo.  Education  She studied engineering at the Paraguay Atheneum from 1939 to 1943 and graduated in pedagogy. She attended a painting course at the Paraguayan University in 1948. In addition to her artwork, she also became a licensed professor that focused on creative education and art for the thirty years that she taught.  Career  Olga Blinder studied painting with Jo√£o Rossi and Ofelia Echag√ºe Vera, having her first exhibition in 1950 at El Ateneo Paraguayo, followed by an exhibition in 1952 at the Paraguayan-American Cultural Center. Some of her most notable work comes from the group she formed in 1954 called Grupo Arte Nuevo (New Art Group), alongside Josefina Pl√°, Lil√≠ del M√≥nico and Jos√© Laterza Parodi. This group was unique because they broke away from the naturalism that had dominated art during the 19th century, instead turning towards expressionism. Central themes they emphasized include humanity and society. The group's aesthetic lacked unity but its art related to constructivist abstraction, stylizations of figuration, and social realism. Working with a Brazilian artist named Livio Bramo, Blinder honed in on her technique of woodcut prints, an artistic medium that she was talented at. She was known as a fundamental promoter of change among the Paraguayan art circles. Blinder was particularly influential in the introduction of modernism to Paraguayan art during the 1950s and 1960s, turning to social realism as the foundation of her work. Her style was known for being expressive and containing hard, rigorous depictions of roughness, generally involving people as the central theme. A key component throughout Blinder's work was the depiction of women, usually rural and indigenous, partaking in everyday tasks of working and nurturing. The 35-year dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner from 1954-1989 was also a central motivation for her artwork in which she sought out to denounce human rights abuses and depict the hardships everyday people were facing. Throughout the 1960s Blinder utilized striking and simplified body forms in woodcut images as a central component of her artwork. By the 1970s Blinder became very involved in print media and made numerous engravings that were filled with intensity. In the 1980s she went back to expressionism as the central aspect of her paintings and her work became more introspective, still embodying themes of human nature and hardship. During her lifetime she participated in a variety of international exhibitions in places such as Holland, Venezuela, Argentina, Spain, Chile, Lisbon, Colombia, Uruguay, and the United States. Blinder used portraits as a way of depicting the faces and bodies of those that were tortured. Her work as a whole was directed towards oppressive political regimes and her artwork became a form of political resistance against the ways in which the government instilled fear among its people. In addition, her pieces recorded traumatic events that weren't documented by official records.  Artwork  Lavandera, 1961  Pareja Triste, 1957  One of her most famous pieces of art is her oil on burlap painting, Pareja Triste, completed in 1957. The painting depicts two individuals, yet their facial features seems to be mirror images of each other, both displaying a morose appearance with their eyes turned downwards and their mouths frowning. The individuals seem to be displaying some sort of immense grief that is shared between them, as seen with their overlapping bodies and the dark tones utilized in the painting. The dark blue and brown hues create a somber tone. The boundaries of the man and woman's body parts are so interwoven that it becomes difficult to distinguish who is who. The painting is said to show an interpersonal experience and shows the contextualization of psychopathology.  Miedo, 1959  A prominent wood engraving of hers is Miedo [Fear], created in 1959. In the woodcut a mother figure seems to be shielding two children in her arms, protecting them from some sort of external force. Potentially, Blinder is illuminating the harsh reality of life for working class citizens and the hardship that the children are to face later on in life  Lavandera, 1961  Another example of her woodcut art is her piece Lavandera, completed in 1961. In the woodwork a woman is portrayed to be diligently at work, scrubbing a garment against a washboard. The jagged angles of the woman's body and angular shapes present in the piece depict the harshness and tough nature of daily life as a worker. The piece is said to be influenced by the German expressionist, L√≠vio Abramo, whom she worked with during the time she created Lavandera.  Los Torturados, 1963  Blinder has another famous series of woodcuts titled Los Torturados [The Tortured] (1963), in which employs two formats. The first is works where bodies are lined up and sometimes placed on top of each other and the second is works where the human body that is depicted is placed at the edge of the sheet. These two methods create a sense of suffering, confinement, and restriction that the imprisoned body experiences. She also depicted decomposing bodies where there were parts of bone, flesh, and fragments shown.  Madre, 1963  Also created in 1963, Blinder created a woodcut on tissue paper called Madre. Fellow artist Livio Bramo said that Blinder's work was \\"profoundly preoccupied with the human condition, and in particular with human sadness.\\" The block shape is very irregular and traces the woman's sloping shoulder and veiled head. There is extreme tension and duress in the child's outstretched hand, seeming to clutch at the woman for support, illuminating the bond of support and love between the two individuals. The piece is said to be representative of the financial struggle and poverty many families faced during Stroessner's dictatorship.  In√∫til Espera, 1968  In her piece In√∫til Espera (Useless Wait), done in 1968, Blinder makes use of the female body by referencing a \\"semantic field that associates more universal aspects of female experience with the specific situation of Paraguayan women - waiting for companions in exile or for political change in the country.\\" In this piece she also makes reference to the oppression everyday people faced during the dictatorship of Stroessner.

Robin has long been a fixture in the Batman comic books as Batman's sidekick. Since 1940, several different youths have appeared as Robin. In each incarnation, Robin's brightly colored visual appearance and youthful energy have served as a contrast to Batman's dark look and manner. This page is a list of the alternative versions of Robin in comic books, including DC Comics, the multiverse, Elseworlds, and other sources. In mainstream comics continuity * Dick Grayson is the original Robin. Though he later assumes the name Nightwing in the comics, Grayson is the most commonly portrayed version in other media. Grayson was temporarily Batman, but with Bruce Wayne's return, he went back to being Nightwing. Following the events of Forever Evil, he became an agent of Spyral under the alias Agent 37. In DC Rebirth, he reclaims the mantle of Nightwing and is part of the Titans team. * Jason Todd becomes Robin after Grayson, though his superheroic career is ended by his untimely death at the hands of The Joker. Todd is later resurrected and assumes the Joker's former identity, the Red Hood. He briefly tried to take over the mantle of Batman, before Dick Grayson made him fall to his apparent death; he is now the Red Hood again traveling with Roy Harper a.k.a. Arsenal, and Starfire the alien princess before disbanding the Outlaws group. Before the events of DC Rebirth, he worked alongside Roy Harper in the \\"Red Hood and Arsenal\\" series. He forms the Outlaws once again in DC Rebirth, this time with Bizarro and Artemis. * Tim Drake assumes the Robin identity after Todd and becomes the third Robin, but quits at the request of his father. After his replacement Stephanie Brown is presumed dead, Drake reclaims the mantle. Batman (Dick Grayson) passes the Robin mantle on to Damian Wayne after the events of Battle for the Cowl. Drake, reluctantly, becomes Red Robin. In the New 52, he was part of the Teen Titans. In DC Rebirth, Drake worked alongside Spoiler, Orphan, and Clayface as part of a boot camp led by Batman and Batwoman, until he was presumed KIA from an attack by a swarm of drones. Instead, he was teleported away and captured by an unknown force at the last second. * Bruce Wayne briefly assumed the role when de-aged during the Sins of Youth storyline. * Stephanie Brown, Tim Drake's girlfriend who was a superheroine known as the Spoiler, briefly takes on the Robin name in place of Drake, becoming the first female version of the superhero and the fourth Robin. She also serves as the third Batgirl before The New 52 reboot restored the title to Barbara Gordon. She is currently in a boot camp led by Batman and Batwoman. * Damian Wayne, the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul and the current Robin, assumed the Robin mantle after the events of Battle for the Cowl. He currently leads the Teen Titans in DC Rebirth. Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths, a number of Robins lived on different \\"Earths\\" in the original multiverse (which was destroyed during Crisis). In a Batman story from the 1950s, Bruce Wayne assumes the identity of Robin. Richard Grayson of Earth-Two carried on his Robin mantle long into adulthood. Post-52, an entirely new finite multiverse was discovered and created, and as such, a number of Robins may exist now on other alternative Earths. In one frame of the final issue of 52, a new Earth-2 is depicted, along with a character that resembles the original, adult Earth-2 Robin. Whether it is that character or not remains to be seen, as this Earth-2 is not identical to the one that existed before Crisis on Infinite Earths. In another case, Talon is an analogue of Robin, from the new Earth-3 where his relationship with Owlman mirrors that of Batman and Robin in the mainstream universes and maintained a romantic relationship with Duela Dent. Batman #666 depicts a future in which Batman's biological son Damian Wayne becomes Batman, having previously served as Robin. Alternative versions Batman: Digital Justice In the digitally rendered tale Batman: Digital Justice, James Gordon the grandson of his namesake, Commissioner Gordon, takes on the mantle of the Batman. A character named Robert Chang, who is somewhat reminiscent of the post-Crisis Jason Todd, takes on the mantle of Robin. Dick Grayson (Earth Two) The Robin of Earth-Two is a parallel version of the fictional DC Comics superhero, who was introduced after DC Comics created Earth-Two, a parallel world that was retroactively established as the home of characters which had been published in the Golden Age of comic books. This allowed creators to publish comic books featuring Robin while being able to disregard Golden Age stories, solving an incongruity, as Robin had been published as a single ongoing incarnation since inception. Robin's origin and history begins the same as the classic version except the timeframe occurs when the Detective Comics #38 was originally printed: 1940. * Richard Grayson's parents are killed by Anthony Zucco. * After a period of training, a young Dick Grayson becomes Robin. His first printed story is \\"Robin, the Boy Wonder.\\"Detective Comics #38. DC Comics. * Robin participates in the war-time only All Star Squadron. His distant cousin is Charles Grayson, the scientific assistant of Robotman. This version of Dick Grayson ceased to exist after the multi arc DC Universe spanning event Crisis on Infinite Earths. He was killed by the Anti-Monitor's Shadow Demons while trying to save civilians, along with Earth-1's Kole and the daughter of Earth- Two's Batman, the Huntress (Helena Wayne). When the Multiverse was recreated in the DC Universe event, Infinite Crisis, a new Earth-Two was born, with a Dick Grayson that resembles the original Earth-Two Grayson. It was established that this new Earth-Two was not the same one as before the Crisis on the Infinite Earths, although Grayson's attitude and his status as a crime-fighter with the Justice Society certainly reflected what had gone before.Justice Society 2008 Annual, 2008 After the events of Flashpoint, Helena Wayne, daughter of Earth-2's Batman and Catwoman served as Robin and became the only partner that Batman had ever had. In this continuity, Bruce Wayne had never adopted Dick Grayson as his ward, so he never became Robin on Earth-2. However, he does appear later, married to Earth-2's Barbara Gordon, who never became Batgirl on Earth-2. Talon (Earth-3) The second Talon is a fictional character shown in Teen Titans #38 (2006), the former sidekick of Owlman, created by Geoff Johns and Tony S. Daniel. He is a former member of the Crime Society and a member of the Teen Titans during the one-year gap after Infinite Crisis. According to an interview with Tony Daniel at Newsarama, Talon is supposed to look like his mentor Owlman. He briefly battled Black Adam with his fellow Titans during World War III. It was revealed in The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society that there have been several Talons. The first one is shown dressed parallel to that of Grayson's classic Robin costume, including brown pixie boots. On post-Crisis Earth-3, the Teen Titans' Talon and Duela Dent, the daughter of the Jokester, had been dating. When Duela revealed their relationship to her parents, her father denounced her and the two fled. It is unknown how the two managed to flee to New Earth, or what has happened to Talon beyond that. Bruce Wayne Junior In \\"The Second Batman and Robin Team\\" (Batman #131, April 1960), Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred writes a story about the possible future of Batman and Robin. In it, Bruce Wayne marries Kathy Kane, the Batwoman and they have a son named Bruce Jr. When Wayne retires as Batman, Dick Grayson takes over the role of the Caped Crusader. Bruce Jr., having secretly trained on his own, volunteers to become the new Robin, despite objections from his mother. As Robin II, he fights alongside Batman II.Batman #131 Several subsequent \\"imaginary stories\\" featuring Bruce Jr. followed; the last in this series was \\"Bat-Girl--Batwoman II\\" in Batman #163 (May 1964). Bruce Wayne Jr next appeared in World's Finest Comics #215 (January 1973) as one of the Super-Sons. Grant Morrison used the Bruce Wayne Jr. character in JLA #9 (September 1997), in the story \\"Elseworlds.\\"In an interview with Wizard, writer Grant Morrison stated that he took inspiration from the Silver Age Bruce Junior stories. After the supervillain Key traps the Justice Leaguers in dream worlds, Batman dreams of a future in which he is married to Selina Kyle/Catwoman. They have a son named Bruce Junior, who was raised from birth to be a superhero and serves as Robin II alongside a Tim Drake Batman. John Byrne created his own Bruce Jr. in the epilogue of the Batman/Captain America crossover from 1996; this Robin is a red-head and resembles a male Carrie Kelley. Captain America wakes up in modern times after having been frozen in ice towards the end of World War II. He reunites with Batman, a friend who had helped him when Joker and Red Skull joined forces. Cap is amazed to learn that in the time he slept, Bruce Wayne has retired from being Batman, has passed the mantle to Dick Grayson and that his son Bruce Junior is the new Robin. Byrne revisited Bruce Jr. in his Superman & Batman: Generations series. There, Bruce Junior is son of Bruce Senior and his wife, who is never identified but is implied to be Julie Madison. \\"BJ\\" greatly desires to be a hero and trains in the hopes of following in his father's footsteps. His mother refuses to let BJ become Robin until he turns eighteen. On Halloween night of 1964, when BJ is fifteen, he and Superman's daughter Kara (Supergirl) sneak out to have an adventure and, with the help of Wonder Woman's daughter Wonder Girl and The Flash's nephew Kid Flash join forces to defeat some of Flash's Rogue's Gallery. Afterward they decide to form their own team called the Justice League.Superman & Batman: Generations 2 #2 (September 2001) BJ and Kara become romantically involved as adults, but BJ puts the relationship on hold when Joker kills Dick, forcing him to become the third Batman. BJ and Kara eventually marry, but their wedding is halted by Kara's brother Joel Kent. Joel, who had been manipulated his whole life by Lex Luthor to hate his family, kills Kara by punching through her chest. Joel dies shortly thereafter, and BJ agrees to raise his powerless son in order to prevent another such tragedy from happening (he also marries Joel's widow, Mei-Lai, sometime in the intervening years).Superman & Batman: Generations #3 The child, named Clark Wayne, becomes BJ's Robin and is offered the mantle of Batman when he becomes an adult. Clark turns it down, having deduced that he isn't BJ's biological son, and believing that only a real Wayne should be Batman, instead adopts the identity of Knightwing. In the 1990s, BJ goes on a quest to locate his missing father, whom he eventually discovers as having taken over Ra's al Ghul's criminal empire and turned it into a force for good. Bruce asks BJ to assume control of the organization so that he can become Batman once again. A story in Generations II has Bruce's dying wife imply that BJ isn't his biological son, but this is not explored until Generations III, where BJ uses a Lazarus Pit and becomes Robin once more, ultimately learning that he truly is Bruce's son and everything was a plan by his mother to make up for never allowing father and son to work together as heroes. In Generations III, BJ's life is greatly extended by the use of the Lazarus Pit so he can help the human resistance battle the forces of Darkseid, but when he is mortally wounded he decides to pass on, feeling that he's kept Kara waiting far too long; the sight of their spirits departing together is enough to make even Bruce Senior shed a tear.Superman & Batman: Generations III #5 (July 2003) For more information on a similar concept, see Damian Wayne, Bruce Wayne's son by Talia al Ghul. In the wake of his father's apparent death, his father's first Robin, Dick Grayson, took over as Batman with Damian serving as the new Robin. The version of Damian depicted in Batman: The Brave and the Bold has more in common with Bruce Jr. than with his portrayal in comics. Deathwing Introduced as an alternative Dick Grayson from a timeline when his Titan teammate Donna Troy had a son who was driven mad, took on the mantle of Lord Chaos and conquered his world. This version of Dick stayed in his identity of Nightwing and helped train squadrons of superpowered teenagers that became known as the Teen Titans. He was involved with the much younger Titan Mirage during this time. This alternative-future Nightwing came back in time and briefly joins the Team Titans when their mission takes them to their past, our present. This version of Nightwing, attacked and corrupted by a dark version of Raven shortly after his arrival, changes his name to Deathwing, and serves as her assistant. He becomes so twistedly evil that he at one point tracks down his one-time lover, Mirage, and rapes her. She becomes pregnant and has a child named Julienne. During the Zero Hour event that retroactively erased this timeline, Mirage, Terra and Deathwing survive. It is later established that they are from the current timeline, and were shunted through time and given false memories by the Time Trapper, who wished to use them as sleeper agents against the time travel villain Extant. It wasn't revealed until one of the later runs of the Teen Titans that this was not Dick Grayson, in fact his true identity was never uncovered. After this storyline, this version of Nightwing has not been seen since. Whether this version existed at all after the events of Infinite Crisis, or would later to be revealed to be an alternative Dick, Jason, or Tim, is unknown. Red Robin In Kingdom Come (a post-Infinite Crisis Earth-22), a middle-aged Dick Grayson reclaims the Robin mantle and becomes Red Robin, not at the side of his former mentor Batman, but rather with Superman's League. His uniform is closer to Batman's in design, rather than any previous Robin uniform. Age has not slowed him down, as he possesses all of his stealth and fighting skills. In this story he has a daughter with Starfire; Mar'i Grayson (Nightstar). Starfire has apparently died by the time of the story, according to the Elliot S! Maggin novelization, and Nightstar calls Bruce Wayne \\"Grandpa\\", despite no blood relation. At the end of the comic and the novel, Bruce and Dick reconcile. Red Robin reappeared in promotional material for the DC Countdown event. Eventually, it was revealed that this Red Robin was not Dick Grayson, but rather Jason Todd who appeared under the cape and cowl. The Red Robin costume was stated to be more symbolism, than an actual costume choice, as Jason has been both the Red Hood and Robin, being shown as Red Robin. However, in Countdown to Final Crisis #17, Jason dons a Red Robin suit from a display case in the \\"Bat Bunker\\" (Earth-51's equivalent to the Bat Cave) as he and Earth-51 Batman join the fight raging on the Earth above the bunker. Jason keeps his new suit and identity for the rest of his tenure as a \\"Challenger of the Unknown\\", only to discard it on his return to New Earth and revert to his \\"Red Hood\\" street clothing. During the Scattered Pieces tie-in to Batman R.I.P., a new Red Robin makes his appearance, at first only as a glimmering image following Robin (Tim Drake) and suspected to have stolen a briefcase of money from the Penguin. Tim initially suspects Jason Todd of reprising his Red Robin persona. Jason claims innocence, supposing that someone may have stolen his suit when he discarded it earlier. The new Red Robin breaks up a scuffle between Tim and Jason, and later is revealed to be Ulysses Armstrong. Armstrong later changes costumes when he reveals himself to be the new Anarky, and after being severely burned in an explosion, an embattled Tim Drake dons the less-revealing Red Robin costume to hide his wounds. He later returns to his standard uniform. In 2009, a new on-going series was introduced titled Red Robin. The new Red Robin was revealed to be Tim Drake. In 2014-5's Multiversity series, a Red Robin also appears as part of Superman's darker incarnation of the Justice League on Earth-22, still based on the alternate future continuity of Kingdom Come. Earth-6: Stan Lee's Robin DC created a version of Robin for Stan Lee's Just Imagine... line of comics, in which DC Comics characters were re-imagined by Marvel Comics luminary Stan Lee. Robin is an orphan who has been forced by Reverend Darkk, the series' main villain, into becoming a thief and a murderer. He meets Batman when Darkk assigns Robin to kill him. Batman survives the attack and in return shows Robin what kind of a man Darkk really is. Robin joins the good side for a time, but in the crisis issue it is revealed that Robin has in fact been working with Darkk the whole time; in the end he is transformed into a Hawkman, before being reborn through Yggdrasil as the Atom. In the current New 52 DC Multiverse, these events took place on Earth-6. DC One Million In the 853rd Century, the current Batman is aided by the robot called Robin the Toy Wonder. This Batman's parents were guards on the prison planet of Pluto and died in a prison riot that turned into a mass slaughter of the guards. Robin is programmed with the personality of this Batman as a boy and acts as a foil/source of perspective so that he will not become consumed by darkness in his quest for justice. This Robin believes this was the same reason Bruce Wayne brought Dick Grayson into his life.Superman/Batman #79-80 Earth-31: Robin Redblade On this alternate Earth, accelerated climate change has resulted in rapid sea level rise, transforming Earth-31 into a devastated waterworld. On the craft Flying Fox, Robin Redblade is one of the crew, and the vessel is piloted by Captain Leatherwing (Batman of Earth-31). Earth-31 also seems to have its own Teen Titans, and Robin Redblade is a member. Dick Grayson (Earth-43) In this universe, the setting of Batman & Dracula: Red Rain and its sequels, the Flying Graysons are killed by the vampire Batman, as shown in DC Infinite Halloween Special. Dick grows up to become an obsessive vampire hunter, but is turned by Batman in The Search for Ray Palmer: Red Rain, and becomes his partner. Robin has remained a vampire and is now a member of the \\"Blood League\\", a vampire Justice League, alongside Earth-43's Vampire Batman. Dick Grayson (Earth-50) In the Wildstorm Universe, Dick Grayson is a Planetary agent in Gotham City, partnered with a man named Jasper who resembles the Joker. He appears in Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth, prior to the Planetary team's shift into universes with a Batman. However, given the events of Flashpoint, this alternate Earth was merged with Earth-0 and Earth-13 and therefore this character no longer exists in main DC continuity. The Dark Knight Universe Robins These stories are set in Frank Miller's Dark Knight Universe, which is not considered in continuity with the monthly titles. Miller has stated that the Dark Knight Universe consists of Batman: Year One, All Star Batman and Robin, the Spawn/Batman crossover, The Dark Knight Returns, The Dark Knight Strikes Again and the cancelled Holy Terror, Batman! In this version, Batman looks upon his sidekicks as employees rather than proteges (although he refers to Robin as a prot√©g√© in All Star Batman and Robin #9), whom he threatens to \\"fire\\" from their \\"jobs\\", which he even does to Dick Grayson. Dick Grayson In All Star Batman and Robin, in stark contrast to the original timeline, Batman and Dick Grayson are shown at odds from the start, leading to Dick's eventual fall into insanity as depicted in The Dark Knight Strikes Again. In Frank Miller's Dark Knight Universe, Grayson's origin differs in various ways to the official DC Comics Universe. As seen in the All Star Batman and Robin title, he is a twelve-year-old boy who performs in the circus with his two parents, as the Flying Graysons. Bruce Wayne had come to the show many times to watch him perform his stunts. One night, while Wayne watches the show with reporter Vicki Vale, the Graysons perform an amazing feat. The audience begin to cheer and clap when suddenly a man arrives and shoots Grayson's parents in the head. Batman takes out the gunman while some corrupt Gotham City Police officers take Dick Grayson into custody. They take him instead to a place outside Gotham City, into a deserted stretch of forest where they torture and/or execute people, but Batman comes to the rescue. Batman takes Dick into the Batmobile and asks him to join him in his crusade against crime in Gotham City. Dick agrees to join the crusade. Upon arrival in the Batcave, Batman intends for Dick to survive in the cave without any help. However Alfred Pennyworth takes pity on Dick and gives him a meal and a decent place to sleep. Batman is displeased, as he wants Dick to go through the same things he did, whether Dick likes it or not. In order to taunt Batman emotionally, Grayson takes on the appearance of a more grotesque and gruesome- looking \\"Joker\\" until their final confrontation in The Dark Knight Strikes Again. Later, Batman brings in the killer of Dick's parents, a man called Jocko-boy Vanzetti. Batman tells him that even though Vanzetti killed his parents, someone else hired him to do so. Batman gives Grayson, who at the time had an axe, the choice of whether to kill Jocko-boy or not. Grayson cuts the tape over Vanzetti's mouth and asks him who hired him to kill his parents. The answer, much to Batman's disgust, is the Joker. Batman orders Grayson to make himself a costume. He does so using Robin Hood as an inspiration. He becomes an archer and wears a cape with a hood thus calling himself Hood. Batman, upon seeing this, pulls his hood down, telling him that anyone could do simply that. Batman tells him to lose the hood and calls him Robin. With his new alter-ego confirmed, he accompanies Batman to confront Green Lantern, as Batman and Green Lantern talk in one of Batman's safe houses which Robin had painted yellow in order to keep Hal Jordan from using his power ring. After a lengthy discussion in which Jordan loses his composure and strikes Batman, Jordan accuses Batman of kidnapping Grayson and dressing him up as his sidekick. Batman tells Jordan that Robin is not Grayson, but in fact a boy he met six years ago on a trip to Istanbul. He eventually retracts the lie and merely assures Jordan that Grayson is not Robin. Robin then reveals he took Jordan's power ring and after a short fight, Robin accidentally hits Jordan in the throat, cutting his air supply. Batman then hits Grayson to make him 'stay down', unmasks and performs a tracheotomy to save Jordan's life. After this, Batman reflects on the event, saying that he did not do a very good job of teaching Robin and then takes Robin to his parent's grave to grieve, claiming that is where it started. Dick cries and punches the headstone, after which Batman consoles his grieving and mournful young ward. Sometime later, Batman fires Grayson for proving unsatisfactory, which strengthens the rift between the two, and they eventually part ways. In The Dark Knight Returns, Grayson is absent but mentioned several times. First, Commissioner Gordon asks Bruce if he has spoken with him recently, and Bruce coldly says he has not. Later, when Batman's new Robin, Carrie Kelley, rescues Batman and asks about his tank-like vehicle, Batman responds that \\"Dick called it the Batmobile\\", and later when Batman suffers a diabetic stroke, he desperately calls out Grayson's name. He is also shown talking to Grayson in his mind, such as when he calls the Mutant leader a \\"brand of evil we had never dreamed of.\\" This seems to imply a sense of fatherly love otherwise not shown, or that Batman simply missed Grayson's company. In The Dark Knight Strikes Again, Grayson re-appears as a genetically altered supervillain. Sometime after his dismissal, he apparently joined forces with senior villains such as Luthor, and underwent extensive gene manipulation to gain a healing factor and shapeshifting powers, but at the cost of his sanity. At the behest of the government, Grayson begins a maniacal crusade to hunt down and kill as many superheroes as possible, but in order to conceal his identity and partly due to a twisted revenge scheme on Batman, Grayson takes on the appearance of the Joker, who killed himself in The Dark Knight Returns. After maiming and killing a number of heroes, such as Guardian, the Creeper and the Martian Manhunter, he seeks out Carrie Kelley, Batman's new partner, a.k.a. Catgirl, intending to kill her in order to exact his final revenge on Batman. Grayson confronts Carrie and Green Arrow in the sewers and engages them in battle. Carrie strikes him with thermite, acid and all sorts of chemicals that cause Grayson to explode, apparently killing him, but Saturn Girl later has a vision of a second encounter between Carrie and Grayson and reveals to Carrie that Grayson (though his identity is not yet revealed at this point) is still alive. Grayson eventually ambushes Carrie in the Batcave and proceeds to beat her brutally, lacerating her lips and breaking her bones one by one. Batman arrives and recognises Grayson when he activates the Batcave's self-destruct and Grayson attempts to shut it down with his old abort code, prompting him to revert to his original form and costume. As Elongated Man takes Carrie to safety, Batman and Grayson contemptuously go over their bleak history together, with Grayson even admitting that despite his harsh treatment, he loved Batman like a father. The two eventually fight, but Grayson remains unharmed by everything Batman throws at him: when Batman beheads him with a Thanagarian axe, Grayson effortlessly catches his head and places it back on his neck. Eventually, Batman hurls himself and Grayson into a pit of lava beneath the Batcave; Grayson falls into the lava and is totally disintegrated, thereby leaving nothing left of Grayson for him to grow back, while Batman is rescued by Superman. As Grayson's remains disappear, Batman acknowledges his ward's demise with a sad \\"So long, Boy Wonder\\". Jason Todd In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Jason Todd is referred to have died in the line of duty, although the exact details are not given. It is revealed in the prestige format one-shot Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade, co-written by Miller and Brian Azzarello, release on June 15, 2016. It is revealed that after Jason defeats and captures the Joker; the villain becomes fixated on him. After the Joker escaped, Jason tracks his whereabouts on his own, and is brutally beaten to death by the Joker's men. Carrie Kelley Trinity In the Trinity series, reality is altered, removing Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman from the timeline. In this alternative world, \\"Richie\\" Grayson is a member of the Zucco mob.Trinity #25 Elseworlds Alfred is a familiar character in the Batman books as Bruce Wayne's elderly butler. However, in Batman: Dark Allegiances, set in the World War II era, Batman, Catwoman, and Alfred were recruited to fight behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany in the winter of 1940. Alfred is given the codename Robin. In Superman & Batman: Generations, Dick Grayson is Robin until he goes to college. The role is then taken up by Batman's son, Bruce Wayne Junior, against his mother's wishes. However, he gives up the role when Dick is murdered, in order to become Batman. Several years later, Clark Wayne, the biological son of Joel Kent and adopted son of Bruce Wayne Jr., takes on the role of Robin, before becoming Knightwing. Set in the 1960s, Batman: Thrillkiller was written and drawn by Howard Chaykin and Dan Brereton and published in 1997-98. It has Bruce Wayne as a detective in the Gotham Police after his family was ruined by the Great Depression. Wayne Manor has been taken over by the rebellious, and a little demented, Barbara Gordon, daughter of police Commissioner James Gordon. Her live-in boyfriend is Richart Graustark, who goes under the name of \\"Dick Grayson\\", presumably to cover his German origins (World War II being still fresh in people's minds at the time). Barbara and Graustark fight crime as Batgirl and Robin, though, in true 1960s anti-establishment style, their main targets are corrupt cops, in particular those led by the Two-Face-like Detective Duell and the Joker-like but very feminine Bianca Steeplechase. In this version, Grayson's family are still circus acrobats, but their deaths are caused as a result of his activities as Robin rather than the traditional other way round. He is overcome by grief and rage over their murder and his subsequent recklessness leads to his own death. He is replaced as Barbara's partner by Detective Bruce Wayne, who takes the identity of Batman, but the memory of him drives even Barbara to the point of insanity and she adopts the Robin guise as part of seeking revenge. Within the New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-37's 1960s seem comparable to those of Thrillkiller, although while it has a Batgirl, Robin and female Joker, it now seems to lack a Batman. The main character in JLA: The Riddle of the Beast, young Robin Drake brings together all the heroes of The World to battle the Beast (Etrigan). In the French Revolution set Batman: Reign of Terror, Bruce Wayne's sister learns his secret identity, and designs a Robin outfit to aid him. Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty features three generations of Waynes, past, present and future. In the future section, Brenna Wayne is aided by an ape with augmented intelligence in a Robin costume, who goes by the name 'Rodney'. In the American Civil War set The Blue, The Gray and the Bat, Captain Bruce Wayne is aided by a Native American named Redbird. Redbird's family were killed by white men, and, until he got his revenge, he wore war paint in a design similar to a domino mask. In the futuristic Robin 3000, Earth is controlled by despotic aliens. Batman (Bruce Wayne XX) is killed trying to stop them, but his mission is continued by his nephew, Tom (Thomas) Wayne. This was originally created by P. Craig Russell in 1986 as Tom Swift 3000, but later rewritten in 1992 as a Robin story when the original plans fell through. In the Robin 1996 Elseworlds annual, an unnamed young warrior in 16th century Japan is raised by the Bat-Samurai, and nicknamed Tengu, after the bird- spirits, by a female Cat-Ninja. Tengu loses his mentor in battle. Tengu was later revealed to be the rightful heir to the imperial throne, and the usurper (believing he knew this and plotted against him) attempted to kill him. He killed the usurper in self-defense but, since he had already sworn loyalty, was constrained to suicide as a result of this dishonor. In the Detective Comics 1996 Elseworlds annual (Batman: Leatherwing), an orphan on the streets of 17th century Kingston who became cabin boy to Leatherwing the pirate. In the Robin 1998 Legends of The Dead Earth annual, humanity is trying to reach other worlds in generation ships. On one of these, a group called the Proctors have seized control and everyone else are slaves who are executed on their 30th birthdays to conserve the ship's resources. Tris Plover, a 29-year-old slave, rebels against the Proctors. She meets another rebel, called the Batman, who gives her the Robin identity. At the cost of their lives, they succeed in defeating the Proctors and Robin sets the ship on a course for the planet New Gotham. \\"Bird Dark\\" is the name of Batman's partner in the somewhat garbled fables told on another colony world, as featured in the \\"Legends of the Dead Earth\\" Batman Annual #20. (1996) While the name is based on Nightwing, the costume is in Robin's colors. In JLA: The Nail, Dick (as Robin), along with Barbara (as Batgirl) is tortured then murdered by The Joker with his Kryptonian gauntlets, driving Batman temporarily insane after he witnesses their ordeals and death. The grief-stricken hero then kills Joker for revenge. Later, in the sequel JLA: Another Nail, Dick returns as a spirit after the Joker returns from Hell. He helps Batman defeats the Clown Prince of Crime once and for all, and gives Batman the strength to move on. Tiny Titans Tiny Titans is a kiddie-based series follows the exploits of the Teen Titans (and other DCU character), as grade school kids attending school for Super-hero sidekicks. Dick Grayson's Robin is a primary character in the series, and often tries to act like the leader, although the rest of the Tiny Titans rarely listen to him. He temporarily began wearing a kiddie version of his first Nightwing costume, but later went back to being Robin. Later issues eventually introduced Jason Todd and Tim Drake into the series as toddlers who Barbara Gordon babysits. Both Jason and Dick wear the original Robin costumes, while Tim wears the 2006 \\"One Year Later\\" Robin costume. Talon also appears as a frequent enemy of Robin, but in the conclusion of issue 46 he gets his hair cut like Robin by Batman's butler. Batman: Year 100 An alternative version of Robin appears in Paul Pope's Batman: Year 100 limited series.Batman: Year One #1 This Robin is a dark-skinned teenager who acts as Batman's partner as well as the mechanic for \\"the Batmobile\\", a high-tech motorcycle. Little is revealed about this Robin's backstory other than that he was apparently adopted by Batman at a young age, and that Robin is his real name rather than an alias. Unlike other iterations of the character, the Robin in \\"Year 100\\" does not wear a costume.Batman: Year One #4 Pre-Crisis Hypertime Hypertime is a fictional concept presented in the 1999 DC comic book series The Kingdom, to explain any continuity discrepancies in DC Universe stories and a variations of the Multiverse that existed before Crisis on Infinite Earths. During the \\"Hypertension\\" story arc, Superboy Kon-El travels through multiple realities battling Black Zero an evil alternate version of himself that's been abducting other clone Superboys. One of the alternate Superboys has become Batman's latest Robin. Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew The 1980s series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew presented the parallel Earth of \\"Earth-C-Minus,\\" a world populated by funny animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C- Minus was the home of Boyd, the Robin Wonder, a robin sidekick to the Batmouse, and presumably an analog of the mainstream DC Universe's Dick Grayson (including wearing a variant of Dick Grayson's Robin costume).Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #14-15, April‚ÄìMay 1983 Injustice series Injustice: Gods Among Us In the prequel comic of the video game Injustice: Gods Among Us, Damian remains under the guise of Robin until Year Five where he becomes Nightwing. Although he will still become one of Superman's allies in his Regime. It is revealed in Year One that Dick Grayson's death at the hands of Damian Wayne was a mere accident because Damian was frustrated at Dick's lecturing him during a prison riot. In Year Two, Damian makes two minor appearances: once to alert Superman to Sinestro's arrival at the Justice League Watchtower, and again while Despero, having been assaulted by the Sinestro Corps, is crashing toward Earth. In Year Three, Damian attempts to defeat some villains and nearly gets killed but Dick Grayson, (now the new Deadman), saves him and gives him his old Nightwing costume as a birthday present, unaware to Damian or any other Regime members. Despite having severed ties with his father, Damian still greatly regards Alfred. Unknown to Damian, Superman, thinking Damian's ‚ÄúNightwing‚Äù birthday gift is a set up by Batman, secretly sends Zsasz to kill Alfred before Damian arrives back at the Batcave. With Alfred gone, Damian now joins Superman's Regime. Batman, becoming aware of Superman's plan afterward, is too late to convince his son of the truth behind Alfred's death. Injustice 2 In the prequel comic of the video game sequel Injustice 2, Damian is first seen in a prison cell as an imprisoned and powerless Superman and Batman talk about what happened, with Batman, tiring of Superman's insistence that it was somehow Bruce's fault for not being there when Clark needed him most, he turns to walk away. As he does so, Superman throws up the past deceased Robins, Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. Then, suddenly, there is an attack on the prison by the Suicide Squad and an imposter Batman, all under the leadership of Damian's mother, Talia and the League of Assassins, to free Damian for his grandfather Ra's Al Ghul's current plans. Damian becomes very angry at his mother and Athanasia Al Ghul for having killed the powerless prison authorities like Turpin, instead of disarming them and not releasing Superman and Cyborg. At Ra's‚Äô secret lair, Damian is introduced to his sister, Athanasia Al Ghul. Later, in Ra's‚Äô Lair, He meets several other of Ra's‚Äô recruits, including, Vixen, Poison Ivy, Cheetah and the impostor Batman's remaining Suicide Squad members. During this meeting, Ra's Al Ghul talks about the 5 years since Joker's corruption of Superman and the state of the world. Damian is later tasked along with Deadshot and Katana to capture the original Blue Beetle, Ted Kord. On the next day, Damian brings Alfred's corpse from Wayne Manor while having Black Lightning's daughters, and the son of Green Arrow and Black Canary be kidnapped, and later to nurse his butler after resurrecting him in the Lazarus Pit. Later during the Insurgency's raid on Ra's hideout in South America, Damian predicts that the Insurgency will come with no surrender thanks to Batman. Damian fought his father temporarily until a fully recovered Alfred stops them from killing each other. As Blue Beetle destroys Ra's hideout, which indirectly kills most of the extinct animals and accidentally kills Diablo, Damian is separated from Alfred. Despite Alfred currently being under the Insurgency's care, Damian is still glad he is safe. Few days later, Damian was sent to recruit Black Adam. However, the ruler of Kahndaq refuses to cooperate with Ra's. At the same time Damian met Kara Zor-El/Supergirl, who is later revealed to be a Kryptonian like Superman. He and Kara are later fighting terrorists while passing by flying together. As Damian is about kill a terrorist, Kara told him to stop from making a mistake on behalf of her feelings to protect the innocence without killing everyone. On the next day, Adam recommended Damian to stay with him and Kara, while needing his help for their rescue mission on freeing their ally, Diana. As Kara is sent to infiltrate Amazon, the nations' security is very tight, Damian is worried if the Amazons spill the truth about what the Regimes had done 5 years, the Regime will lose Kara, but Adam tells Damian to be patient, and is soon glad to find out that most of the Amazonian are still loyal to Diana, quickly succeeding the rescue without being captured. Upon hearing news about the massacre in the small town at Williams, Arizona caused by his grandfather and Solovar sending Amazo killing every human around including women and children, Damian departs to Gorilla City where the League of Assassins and their Suicide Squad are hiding to inform his closest allies (Vixen and Animal Man) about what the Gorillas and League of Assassins had done to the peaceful people of the said town, then spills the truth to entire two villainous groups to prevent Kahndaq sharing a similar fate, resulting in Gorilla Grodd's failed uprising attempt from taking over Gorilla City, leading him and his followers to be exiled from their home city. He, Animal Man and Vixen soon warn their Regime allies about Ra's and Solovar's plan to bring destructions on innocent humans, while Kara herself is not yet prepared to fight against Amazo and must stay in Kahndaq. The third Robin, Tim Drake/Red Robin, one of the Titans who first rebelled Superman's regime is being released from the Phantom Zone's imprisonment along with Wonder Girl and Starfire, with the exception of Superboy who preferred to stay in the said dimension after Superman broke his heart back in the first game's previous comic issue. Unfortunately, Tim's reunion did not last long, as Zod trails the Titans to be able to escape and shots Tim's heart with his Heat Vision from behind, killing the Boy Wonder. Before Batman plans to avenge Tim's death, Ra's sends Amazo to kill Zod for good, and Harley sadly expresses about how Tim had been a better Robin as Dick used to be if they were alive. After fully he recovered from his heart surgery during Amazo's attack, Superboy, now the Insurgency's new Superman learned that he is now implanted with Zod's heart, the same villainous Kryptonian general who murdered Tim. At some point after Damian was forced to return to League of Assassins by his mother and younger sister, Damian figured out that the impostor Batman is none other than the revived former second Robin, Jason Todd, now working for Ra's. During the Insurgency's raid on the Assassins' hideout in South America to save one of their kidnapped children and Harley, Jason fought Wildcat and almost killed him, until Green Arrow and Black Canary's son Conner knocks Jason back with a sonic scream inherited from his mother Canary. As the League of Assassins and their Suicide Squads relocated in Gorilla City to allied themselves with King Solovar, then recently kill the peaceful human civilians in Arizona by dispatching Amazo, Jason starting to doubt about Ra's ideal. By time Ra's and Solovar begin their plans to wipe out every humans on Earth after Grodd and his followers had been exiled, Damian, Vixen, and Animal Man plan a second rebellion against Ra's for his madness. Jason soon figures out the three heroes' plan to betray Ra's. However, Damian tries to convince Jason of what they are doing for Ra's is actually wrong, and believes in him that killing innocent human civilians is not what he desired. Injustice vs. The Masters of the Universe As this series continues alternatively from the second game's bad ending, it revealed that Damian (now as a new Batman) and his fellow ex-Regime and Titans member Cyborg finally realize what they have been fighting for, just like how The Flash, Hal Jordan and the late-Shazam felt before them, and began to defect to and lead the Insurgency, while also being joined by the former Batman imposter Jason/Red Hood. Damian admit on never forget his accidental sin he committed on his late-Nightwing predecessor Dick. When Skeletor's Army arrived in their universe's Earth, at the same time Darkseid's Apokalips Army arrived there as well, Damian summoned He-Man/Prince Adam and his allies for a same purposes. After manage to find and freed his both father and predecessor from Superman's Brainiac Tech brainwashing, Damian told him about Supergirl's location and compare Superman to be just like Zod and Ra's was. Unfortunately, Damian is snapped by Wonder Woman's lasso on his neck from behind in cold blood, but his death eventually gives original Batman a stronger will to break free from Superman's control. When Skeletor revealed his true color on playing both Darkseid and Superman's side for his scheme, Superman stand down and recently mourn Damian's death, leading him once again made a temporary truth to settle with Darkseid and Skeletor.

It stars Lino Capolicchio, Dominique Sanda and Helmut Berger. The film is based upon Giorgio Bassani's 1962 novel of the same name. It won the Golden Bear at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival, and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1972. Plot In the late 1930s, in Ferrara, a group of young friends get together for afternoons of tennis and happy times. Some of them are Italian Jews and a rising tide of Fascism has imposed increasingly anti-Semitic restrictions in their lives. Barred from regular tennis clubs, they go to play at the grand, walled estate owned by the Finzi-Continis, a wealthy, intellectual and sophisticated Jewish family. The two young Finzi-Continis, Alberto and his sister Mic√≤l, have organized a tennis tournament. Oblivious to the threats around them, life still seems to be sunny at the large Finzi-Contini estate, keeping the rest of the world at bay. Among the visitors there is a man vying for the beautiful, tall and blonde Mic√≤l Finzi-Contini. Giorgio, her middle class Jewish childhood friend, feels entitled to her heart. A series of flashbacks show how Giorgio used to wait outside the walls of the estate, hoping for a glimpse of Mic√≤l. As teenagers they became fast friends. Now as adults, they enjoy their mutual company and Mic√≤l gives Giorgio special attention. Escaping a sudden downpour in a gazebo, Giorgio tries to touch her, but she rejects him. Alberto, whose health is fragile, enjoys a close friendship with Giampiero Malnate, a darkly handsome gentile with socialist sympathies. Giorgio's father considers the Finzi-Continis so different that they don‚Äôt even seem to be Jewish. Wealth, privilege and generations of intellectual and social position have bred them into a family as proud as it is vulnerable. The other Jews in the town react to Mussolini's edicts in various ways: Giorgio is enraged; his father is philosophical. But the Finzi-Continis hardly seem to know, or care, what is happening. Giorgio, who is about to graduate, becomes a frequent visitor to the Finzi-Continis' villa where he is allowed to use their extensive library. He is in love with Mic√≤l, and she seems to return his feeling, but she unexpectedly leaves to stay in Venice with her uncles. On her return Mic√≤l changes, coldly rejecting any show of affection from Giorgio. Instead she carries on an affair with Giampiero, a man she claims to despise as too vulgar, crude, and leftist for her tastes. Peeking through a window Giorgio discovers Giampiero and Mic√≤l naked together. Heartbroken Giorgio is comforted by his father. The political events close in. A journey to visit his brother Ernesto in Grenoble exposes Giorgio to news of the Nazi persecution, but he returns to Ferrara. With the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Giampiero is recruited and sent to the Russian front. By 1943 all the young Jews who used to visit the Garden of the Finzi-Continis have been arrested. Giampiero has been killed at the Russian front. By the time the frail and sick Alberto dies, Italy is occupied by the Germans and the fascists are hunting down and rounding up the Jews of Ferrara. The Finzi-Continis are abruptly taken away from their contentment and illusory isolation. Separated from her parents Mic√≤l and her frail and distraught grandmother are placed in a former classroom. They are surprised to find Giorgio‚Äôs father. Anxiously she asks him about Giorgio. He tells her that he hopes that Giorgio and the rest of his family has made it abroad. The fate of the Jews of Ferrara is to be deported to the concentration camps. Giorgio's father hopes that at least they won't be separated. Images show happy days of Mic√≤l and Giampiero playing tennis and now the empty tennis court. The sequence is accompanied by the El male rachamim, a Jewish lament for the dead.  Cast  The Garden of the Finzi-Continis marked the debut or near-debut for some of its stars, notably the actors who played the two adult Finzi-Contini children, Mic√≤l and Alberto. For Dominique Sanda (Mic√≤l), it was her first Italian feature film (followed by such films as The Conformist and 1900). For Helmut Berger (Alberto), it was his second feature film. *Lino Capolicchio ‚Äì Giorgio *Dominique Sanda ‚Äì Mic√≤l *Helmut Berger ‚Äì Alberto *Fabio Testi ‚Äì Malnate *Romolo Valli ‚Äì Giorgio's Father *Camillo Cesarei ‚Äì Mic√≤l's Father * Inna Alexeievna ‚Äì Mic√≤l's Grandmother * Katina Morisani ‚Äì Mic√≤l's Mother * Barbara Pilavin ‚Äì Giorgio's mother  Reception  In 1972, the Garden of the Finzi-Continis won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. It won the Golden Bear at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival in 1971. It was de Sica's penultimate film. While the film was well received by the public and the cinematic community, there was controversy in the literary community over the fact that the film made Mic√≤l's relationship with Malnate explicit. This alteration changed the tone of the work, and tainted Mic√≤l's persona. It led to Giorgio Bassani attempting to distance himself from Vittorio de Sica's work.

The device is available in four capacities of Flash memory: 2 GB (e250), 4 GB (e260), 6 GB (e270), and 8 GB (e280). All players have a 1.8-inch, TFT LCD display with a resolution of 176 by 220 pixels. Certain files, if not in a format accepted by the player's original firmware, must first be converted with the Sansa Media Converter Windows software. This will convert images to bitmap format (.bmp) and videos to MJPEG (in a .mov container), for v1 models. On v2 players it will convert videos to DivX and simply resize images. It is not possible to simply copy videos to the device, even if they seem to be in the correct format; trying to access them displays an error message. Features The Sansa e200 series can display album art and display song information, thanks to the audio files' ID3 content. The players are powered by a user-replaceable (offered as replacement set by SanDisk and some competitors) lithium ion battery that is also rechargeable, and come with a built-in expansion slot for microSD cards, an FM tuner with a recording function (only available in North America, Japan, New Zealand, Australia and some other countries), and microphone for voice recording. SanDisk released a version 2 of the e200 series in December 2007 with internal hardware different from the first version. Version 2 changes include support for Rhapsody channels through RhapPFS DRM (Plays For Sure enhanced to support Rhapsody channels), support for Audible audio books, microSDHC, and DivX, and also has a different boot screen and adds the ability to format the device, among other minor improvements.  Issues  The player lacks Asian text support when displaying song names and artists, but users can patch the firmware to add support. Rockbox firmware also supports the e200 series just as it supports the c200 series, and adds the same features. The standard firmware for e200 models with version 1 hardware is not compatible with the newer microSDHC format (generally 4GB and higher); Rockbox firmware adds this support. Rockbox also supports e200 models with version 2 hardware. A number of bugs in the firmware cause problems. One introduces a 0.2 second delay between tracks, even those that are consecutive to a given album. This is most noticeable on musical tracks where the song does not fade completely out before the next begins. Artists whose names begin with \\"The\\" are listed incorrectly as well. For unknown reasons, the order of tracks on a given album play in alphabetical order, seriously disrupting the continuity of the listening experience. The early firmware for version 2 units (firmware version information is under Settings >> Info) removed the ability for unsupported operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to see the internal storage as a standard flash drive when plugged in via the USB port. Version 1 players had a menu option under the Settings menu for storage mode that could be toggled to show up as standard USB flash drive. For V2 Sansa players with firmware version V03.01.11, this option has been completely removed from the settings menu. Upgrading to later firmware versions, V03.01.14 or V03.01.16 will restore the USB Mode menu option under the Settings menu. Under the USB Mode menu are three choices - Auto Detect, Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), and USB mass-storage class (MSC). MSC is Mass Storage Class where the computer would see the Sansa as a regular flash drive. MTP is Media Transfer Protocol which is a Microsoft-specific mode invented to deal with media files that include Digital Rights Management.  e200R Series  The Sansa e200R was released in October 2006. Physically identical to the regular Sansa e200, this player is sold exclusively at Best Buy, or directly through Rhapsody, the RealNetworks digital music store. The main differences in the e200R is the firmware and bootloader, which are not easily interchangeable with the e200. The player has a feature called \\"Rhapsody Channels\\", which is the online service's brand of podcasting, and also comes with pre-loaded content. Models with smaller capacities will receive about 1 GB of pre-loaded content, while bigger ones will have approximately 2 GB. It also anti-aliases the text displayed, and has different names for the USB modes.898141  See also  * SanDisk * SanDisk Sansa * Sansa c200 Series * Sansa Fuze * Comparison of portable media players  References   External links  *SanDisk Sansa Micro Site Category:Digital audio players Category:Portable media players Category:SanDisk products ru:Sansa#Sansa —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏ e200 ","title":"Sansa e200 series"},{"id":"8058816","text":"A sports photographer looking around during 2019 Pocono 400. Photographers at a game at Croke Park, Ireland. Note the use of telephoto lenses. Filming from a motor is done often in endurance sports. Pictured: Ellen van Dijk at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Photographer on the sideline of an American football game with multiple cameras, long lenses, and monopods. Mikaela Shiffrin Sports photography refers to the genre of photography that covers all types of sports. In the majority of cases, professional sports photography is a branch of photojournalism, while amateur sports photography, such as photos of children playing association football, is a branch of vernacular photography. The main application of professional sports photography is for editorial purposes; dedicated sports photographers usually work for newspapers, major wire agencies or dedicated sports magazines. However, sports photography is also used for advertising purposes both to build a brand and as well as to promote a sport in a way that cannot be accomplished by editorial means. Equipment Equipment typically used for sports photography includes a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera or Mirrorless Camera with high continuous shooting speeds and interchangeable lenses ranging from 14mm to 400mm or longer in focal length, depending on the type of sport. The proper lenses are very important as they allow the photographer to reach closer or farther as quickly as possible to keep up with the game play. Essential accessories include a monopod or tripod for stability and extra batteries. Longer focal length lenses are typically used to photograph action in sports such as football, while wide angle lenses can be used for sideline and close- up athlete photos. Camera bodies The preferred camera bodies for modern sports photography have fast autofocus and high burst rates, typically 8 frames per second or faster. The current flagship sports cameras produced by Canon and Nikon are the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II and the Nikon D5; these are popular in professional sports photography. As a non-professional, there are multiple other camera bodies to choose from. If you are a fan of DSLR camera, bodies like the Canon 6D and the Canon 5D offer full frame censors to get the highest quality image without compromising ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed in your camera settings. Other non-professionals looking to get the newest technology in the photography world can use Sony Alpha A7 III or the Canon EOS R. Lenses Different sports favor different lenses, but sports photography usually requires fast (wide aperture) telephoto lenses, with fast autofocus performance. Fast autofocus is needed to focus on movement, telephoto to get close to the action, and wide aperture for several reasons: * The background is dramatically put out of focus due to a shallow depth of field, resulting in better subject isolation. * The lenses can focus more quickly due to the increase in light entering the lens ‚Äì important with fast- moving action. * Faster shutter speeds can be used to freeze the action. Extremely wide apertures (such as f/1.2 or f/1.4) are more rarely used, because at these apertures the depth of field is very shallow, which makes focusing more difficult and slows down autofocus. The main distinction is between outdoor sports and indoor sports ‚Äì in outdoor sports the distances are greater and the light brighter,Canon Outdoor Sports Lens Recommendations, The Digital Picture while in indoor sports the distances are lesser and the light dimmer.Canon Indoor Sports Lens Recommendations, The Digital Picture Accordingly, outdoor sports tend to have longer focal length long focus lenses with slower apertures, while indoor sports tend to have shorter lenses with faster apertures. Both zoom and prime lenses are used; zoom lenses (generally in the 70‚Äì200, 75‚Äì300, 100‚Äì400 or 200-400 range) allow a greater range of framing; primes are faster, cheaper, lighter, and optically superior, but are more restricted in framing. As an example the Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8G ED VR AF lens and the Canon EF 300mm f/2.8L IS II USM lens are both fixed telephoto lenses which cannot zoom. Apertures of f/2.8 or faster are most often used, though f/4 is also found, particularly on brighter days. Particularly visible are the Canon super telephoto lenses, whose distinctive white casing (to dissipate the sun's heat) is recognizable at many sporting events. Of these, the Canon 400mm f/2.8 is particularly recommended for field sports such as football.Canon EF 400mm f/2.8 L IS USM Lens Review, The Digital Picture This varies with sport and preference; for example golf photographers may prefer to use a 500mm f/4 as opposed to a 400mm f/2.8 as it is a lighter lens to be carried around all day. Indoor sports photography, as mentioned earlier, can present its own challenges with less distance between the action and photographer and extreme lighting. For example, competition cheerleading allows for photographers to be up close to the action while looking upwards directly into harsh stage lighting against a black background. A different approach to such a situation is to use the prime lens named a \\"nifty fifty\\". The shutter speed is extremely fast while still setting the aperture to bring in enough light. In this scenario a budget telephoto lens would produce both dark and blurry images. Using a prime 50mm lens is a budget friendly option for many other indoor events such as school plays, concerts, dance recitals, etc. Remote cameras Sports photographers may use remote cameras triggered by wireless shutter devices (i.e. Pocket Wizards) to photograph from places they could not otherwise stay, for example in an elevated position such as above a basketball basket, or to be in two places at once, i.e. at the start and the finish - such as at horse racing. Technique Location is often important for sports photography. At big events, professional photographers often shoot from VIP spots with the best views, usually as close to the action as possible. Most sports require the photographer to frame their images with speed and adjust camera settings spontaneously to prevent blurring or incorrect exposure. Some sports photography is also done from a distance to give the game a unique effect. Getting to know your subjects is critical in capturing emotion. Effects and editing can only do so much for a photo. Understanding who athletes are by having a conversation with them can change your view on the person, making you a better photographer. Knowing the game. Predicting what happens next in a sports game is critical in understanding how to compose your shot. The action moves fast so you take the time to prepare yourself before going out and taking photos. Panning Shutter speed is critical to catching motion, thus sports photography is often done in shutter priority mode or manual. A frequent goal is to capture an instant with minimal blur, in which case a minimal shutter speed is desired, but in other cases a slower shutter speed is used so that blur shows to capture the motion, not simply the instant. A particular technique is panning, where the camera uses an intermediate shutter speed and pans with the subject, yielding a relatively sharp subject and a background blurred in the direction of motion, yielding a sense of speed ‚Äì compare speed lines. ISO speed is often high (to allow faster shutter speeds) and may be left in auto. Photos are often taken in burst mode to capture the best moment, sometimes in combination with JPEG rather than RAW shooting (JPEG files being smaller, these allow longer bursts). Strip photography While the vast majority of sports photography focuses on capturing a moment, possibly with some blur, the technique of strip photography is sometimes used to instead show motion over time. This is most prominent in a photo finish, but can also be used for other purposes, often yielding unusually distorted images. Notable photographers A number of notable photographers are known for their sports work; they have often worked for the magazines Life or Sports Illustrated. * John G.

His name is sometimes read as Yoshitomo.Papinot, Jacques. (2003). Nobiliare du Japon -- S≈ç, p. 56; Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d'histoire et de g√©ographie du Japon. Under the influence of Konishi Yukinaga, he was baptized and accepted the name \\"Dario\\". He took part in Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea in the 1590s, and led a force in the Siege of Busan. The S≈ç clan did not participate in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600; however, the tozama S≈ç clan were allowed to continue to rule Tsushima.Appert, Georges 'et al. (1888). Ancien Japon, p. 77. Early life Yoshitoshi was the fifth son of S≈ç Masamori; his wife, who took the baptismal name Maria, was the daughter of Konishi Yukinaga. Yoshitoshi became the head of the family in 1580, after his adoptive father, S≈ç Yoshishige, was defeated, and Tsushima conquered, in a prelude to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Ky≈´sh≈´ Campaign. Yoshitoshi thus entered Hideyoshi's service and began organizing negotiations with Korea, as Hideyoshi's representative. The Joseon king refused to allow Japanese troops to pass peacefully through Korea in an attempt to conquer Ming-dynasty China, and the negotiations ultimately proved entirely fruitless, leading to Hideyoshi's decision to invade Korea militarily. In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi confirmed the S≈ç clan possession of Tsushima. Yoshitoshi played a crucial role in Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea, as a result of Tsushima's strategic location between Japan and Korea, and his knowledge of, and experience with, Korea. He thus led the first major land assault of the Imjin War, the Siege of Busan, on 13 April 1592, while Konishi Yukinaga attacked the Korean naval fortress. He continued his command through a number of the ensuing engagements. After Sekigahara Shortly after news of the Toyotomi defeat at the Battle of Sekigahara was received by the Joseon Court, a process of re- establishing diplomatic relations was initiated by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1600. As an initial gesture and as an earnest of future progress, some Joseon prisoners were released at Tsushima Island. In response, a small group of messengers under the leadership of Yujeong were sent to Kyoto to investigate further. With the assistance of S≈ç Yoshitomo, an audience with Ieyasu was arranged at Fushimi Castle in Kyoto.Kang, Jae-eun et al. (2006). The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism, pp. 312‚Äì313. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu established a new shogunate; and S≈ç Yoshitoshi was officially granted Fuch≈´ Domain (100,000 koku) in Tsushima Province. In 1604, Yujeong confirmed the Joseon interest in developing further contacts; and the Tokugawa sh≈çgun reciprocated by releasing 1,390 prisoners-of-war.Kang Jae-eun, p. 274. Yoshitomo's descendants held this domain until the abolition of the han system. The S≈ç would remain the shogunate's intermediaries with the Joseon government throughout the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868); and the clan would profit politically and economically. As representatives and spokesmen for the Tokugawa, the S≈ç helped ensure a continuing series of major Joseon missions to Edo (Joseon missions to the Tokugawa shogunate). These benefited the Japanese as legitimizing propaganda for the bakufu (Tokugawa shogunate) and as a key element in an emerging manifestation of Japan's ideal vision of the structure of an international order, with Edo as its center.Walker, Brett L. \\"Foreign Affairs and Frontiers in Early Modern Japan: A Historiographical Essay\\", Early Modern Japan (Fall 2002), p. 48.

Life He was son of Robert Graves (died 1825), and younger brother of the engraver Robert Graves, A.R.A. He was born on 16 July 1806. At the age of sixteen he became an assistant of Samuel Woodburn, the art dealer, and later was employed by Messrs. Hurst, Robinson, & Co., the successors of Boydell, as manager of their print department. Tuer alleges that the company name \\"Hodgson, Boys & Graves\\" was changed to \\"Hodgson & Graves\\" in 1841 but the name change seems to have occurred in 1836. On the failure of this firm in 1825, Graves, in conjunction with Francis Graham Moon and J. Boys, acquired the business which was carried on with various changes of partnership until 1844, when Graves became sole proprietor ; the title of the firm has since been Henry Graves & Co. He also had a print publishing partnership, Hodgson & Graves, with Richard Hodgson. In the course of an enterprising and successful career, throughout which he was recognised as the leading London printseller, Graves published an immense number of fine engravings from pictures by Turner, Wilkie, Lawrence, Constable, Landseer, Faed, Frith, Grant, Millais, and other contemporary painters. He specially devoted himself to the reproduction of the works of Sir Edwin Landseer, employing upon the work the best engravers of the day, and paying the artist himself more than ¬£50,000 for copyrights. He also issued valuable library editions of the works of Reynolds, Lawrence, Gainsborough, Liverseege, and Landseer. Graves was one of the founders of The Art Journal and the Illustrated London News, an active member of the Printsellers' Association and the Artists' General Benevolent Fund, and a governor of the Shakespeare memorial at Stratford. He died at his house on Pall Mall, London, on 23 August 1892, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.Obituary, The Times, 24 August 1892, p.8.

Graves studied German in Bonn, Germany, before working for his father's company Henry Graves & Co., researching for catalogues that the company published. Career During a period of recovery following an injury, Graves had the idea of creating a catalog of art that was exhibited in London, from his extensive lists of artists and their works that he had compiled while working on other projects. In 1884 he published the first edition of his idea, entitled \\"A Dictionary of Artists who have Exhibited Works in the Principal London Exhibitions from 1760 to 1880\\". A second edition followed in 1885 and a third in 1901. In 1899, Graves and William V. Cronin issued the first volume of their work on Sir Joshua Reynolds, which they sold by subscription. In 1900, a book on Sir Thomas Lawrence by Lord Ronald Gower included a catalogue by Graves. When his father Henry died in 1892, Algernon took over the running of Henry Graves & Company, where he worked until he retired in 1907. Personal life Graves married the daughter of an art dealer, John Clowes Grundy from Manchester, England and they had a son, Herbert Seymour Graves, who later assisted Graves with later editions of the Dictionary of Artists series.
