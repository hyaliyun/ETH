Biography He was the son of John Spring (d.1601) and his wife Mary (or Anne) Trelawney. He was the grandson of Sir William Spring of Lavenham and his first wife Anne Kitson, and of John Trelawney of Menheniot, Cornwall and his wife Anne Reskymer. His stepfather was Sir Robert Gardiner, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating in 1603, followed by Middle Temple until 1606. At university, Spring became a close friend of another student from Suffolk, John Winthrop, with whom he would correspond for the rest of his life. He served as High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1596 and was knighted by James I on 12 February 1611. He served his second term as High Sheriff in 1621. He was first elected as Member of Parliament for Suffolk in 1623. Whilst in London for the 1624 meeting of Parliament, Spring kept a diary of proceedings in the House of Commons, which is now a valuable record of the time. He was elected to serve as the MP for Bury St Edmunds in 1625. Spring had been brought up as a Puritan by his stepfather, Sir Robert Gardiner, and was involved in several Parliamentary commissions regarding the Roman Catholic faith in England, such as a commission of \\"inquiry into popish schoolmasters.\\" He was initially reluctant to stand for Parliament in the 1628 elections due to poor health, but was convinced by Sir Edward Coke and was returned as the MP for Suffolk. Spring was appointed to a bill committee concerning the neglect of preaching and catechizing, and sat on a committee of inquiry into electoral irregularities in Cornwall. He left no trace on the records of the Commons' brief 1629 session. Spring was a Justice of the Peace in Suffolk between 1618 and his death, and held numerous other local offices such as Commissioner for Piracy (1627) and Commissioner for Trade (1625). During the 1630s, Spring used his large fortune to found two lectureships at the University of Cambridge. However, they were opposed by the Laudian bishop and Vice-Chancellor of the university, Matthew Wren, who subsequently closed down both of them. Sir William died in 1638 at Ridenhall, and was buried at Pakenham. He had married Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Sir William Smith, in 1610, with whom he had nine children. He was succeeded by his son, William, who was made a baronet by Charles I.

It was Carax's first feature film. The plot follows the relationship between an aspiring filmmaker (Denis Lavant), who has just been left by his lover, and a suicidal young woman (Mireille Perrier), who is also reeling from a failed romance. Plot A depressed, aspiring filmmaker falls in love with a suicidal young woman. Both have been recently dumped by their lovers and neither is coping very well. They meet via an apartment block intercom system. Later the filmmaker sees her by the Seine. They finally meet in person at an elegant party and begin a long, strange conversation over a kitchen table. During the course of their talking, the two find themselves unable to resist their mutual neediness and this leads them to tragedy.

It was released in France on 21 November 1984. Vincent Canby reviewed the film for The New York Times: \\"Mr. Carax is 24, but Boy Meets Girl looks like the work of a talented 18-year-old, someone who still spends more time inside the Cinematheque Francaise than outside it. ... In Boy Meets Girl, one recognizes a bit of Jean-Luc Godard here, something of Francois Truffaut there, and every now and then one hears what may be the faint, original voice of Mr. Carax trying to make himself heard around and through the images of others.\\" Canby added however that \\"Boy Meets Girl has been handsomely photographed (by Jean-Yves Escoffier) in black-and-white images that look as velvety smooth as fudge sauce atop vanilla ice cream. The performances are perfectly decent -Miss Perrier is especially good in a long Godardian monologue. What's still missing is the film maker's own idiosyncratic personality, which, if it exists, could surface in Mr. Carax's next film.\\" The film had a total of 131,042 admissions in France. http://jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=6700 References External links  Category:1984 drama films Category:1984 films Category:French black-and- white films Category:Films directed by Leos Carax Category:French drama films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:Films set in Paris ","title":"Boy Meets Girl (1984 film)"},{"id":"32543701","text":"A Pseudocolumn is a \\"column\\" that yields a value when selected, but which is not an actual column of the table.

But his stay in Denmark was to be short since he only a month later was sent to Norway as a first lieutenant in the 14th artillery company in Trondheim. In 1787, Ohme returned to Denmark and was promoted to captain on November 23, and later Major on 12 June 1795. Military career On 8 May 1805, Ohme was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the artillery, and returned to Norway as a colonel and head of the Artillery Corps on 8 February 1809. At the outbreak of the Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809 he was put in charge of a reserve brigade in the area between Grønsund and Fetsund, and later during the war transferred to the infantry. After the war in 1809, he became interim commander at Akershus Fortress, and later commandant at Fredriksten from the 13 February 1810. He was on 25 January 1812 also promoted to major general. During the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814, Fredriksten fortress came under siege, and suffered under heavy bombardment. But the fortress held out and was not surrendered to the Swedes until after the Convention of Moss. Ohme was later again offered the position of commandant at Fredriksten, but turned it down.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The mansion was built in the old English Tudor style, completed in 1908. It was built for Mr. W. Lester Mangum and his wife Jennie Knight Mangum. Mrs. Mangum was the daughter of the famous Utah mining man, Jesse Knight. The lot was purchased for $3,500 and the home was built at a cost of about $40,000. The Mangum family was able to afford the home due to the fact that they had sold their shares in Jesse Knight's mine located in Tintic, Utah, for eight dollars a share. They had purchased the shares for only twenty cents a share, so the excess allowed them enough funds to purchase the home. The contractors for the home were the Alexandis Brothers of Provo. Description \\"This two and one half story house in a style which is the product of the Arts and Crafts movement has an asymmetrical composition, steep gable roof with exposed rafters, decorative stick work on the top two stories, cross gables and gable dormers, exposed purlins, decorative brackets along the roofline, and a flat roofed single story porch with exposed rafters that wrap around the southeast corner. The house rests on a raised concrete basement. Clinker brick has been used for the first story, for the posts of the porch, for the chimneys, and for the wall that surrounds the house. The upper stories are of wood frame and stucco with stick work. The windows are grouped in various arrangements, including a three party bay window on the second story gable end of the facade, and are casements with wood stripping around their edges. Changes in the fenestration of the west wall and the addition of a two story exterior staircase on the northwest corner are alterations which detract from the original integrity of the building, but are not significant enough to destroy its original effect. (Cannon p. 2)\\" The Victorian mansions of Provo Built between the years 1893 and 1908 in Provo, Utah, this group of Victorian mansions are historically significant and represent not only fine architecture but some of the most successful men of the city and state at the time. These mansions include the Charles E. Loose House, the William H. Ray House, the Knight-Allen House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight–Mangum House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. All of these homes derive from the high style: Eastlake, Shingle, Craftsman, Italianate, Classical, Moorish, Colonial, and Romanesque Revivals. Made primarily of brick, these homes exhibit the finest architecture and most ornate detailing to be found in the city of Provo. Jesse Knight and the Tintic mining industry The successful commercial mining of precious metals and minerals transformed Utah's economy from basically an agrarian base to a more industrialized state. Within this development the Tintic Mining District, located approximately thirty miles southwest of Provo, was founded in 1869 and by 1899 became the leading mining center in Utah with a value of output placed at $5 million. A central figure in Tintic success was Jesse Knight and the Knight family who resided in Provo. Jesse Knight attained wealth with his Humbug mine in the mid-1890s. The large silver producer allowed Knight to develop other mines in the East Tintic area. Knightsville grew around the workings and became touted as the only saloon-free, prostitute-free, privately owned mining camp in the U.S. His strict adherence to doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made the town one inhabited primarily by members of that church. Jesse Knight was able to expand farther than the tintic mines, reaching to the power plant in Santaquin, the Tintic drain tunnel project, the Knight Dry farm, and the smelters at Silver City. The Bonneville Mining company, the Knight Woolen Mills, Ellison Ranching Company, The American- Columbian Corporation, The Springville–Mapleton Sugar Company, The Spring Canyon Coal Company, Utah Savings Bank, The Layton Sugar Company, and the Tintic Drain Tunnel Company all represent facets of the Knight Investment Company. W. Lester and Jennie Knight Mangum W. Lester Mangum was born in 1873 in Nephi, Utah. He attended Brigham Young University and was made an instructor in English there. In 1905 he married Jennie Knight, the daughter of the mining magnate Jesse Knight. Mangum was quickly included in the Knight family businesses and held different executive positions in these businesses. He also served as vice-president and manager of the American Colombian Corporation which owned huge tracts of land in South America. Mangum was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served as a member of his stake's high council. Mrs. Mangum was active in civic and church affairs. Preservation After the death of Mr. Mangum in 1949, the home was sold to Paul Salisbury of Salt Lake City who divided the home up into eleven individual apartments. In 1969 Mr. Milo Baughman, one of America's leading furniture designers and present chairman of the Environmental Design Department at BYU, acquired the home. It is now used as an apartment building. The carriage house which was built next to the home has also been transformed into apartments as well. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as part of a multiple property submission that nominated seven and listed six Provo houses. The listed houses are this house, the Knight–Mangum House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Allen House, the William H. Ray House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. The seventh, the Charles E. Loose House, was determined to be NRHP- eligible but was not NRHP-listed due to owner objection. The Knight-Mangum mansion was designated as a historic landmark of the city of Provo on April 28, 1995.

It was also released as the B-side of Lennon's \\"Jealous Guy\\" single in 1985. Lyrics & music The lyrics of \\"Going Down on Love\\" reflect Lennon's feelings during his so-called \\"lost weekend\\" separation from wife Yoko Ono. As such, it sets the tone for the entire Walls and Bridges album. Lennon laments the fact that even though his life at the time looked like fun, he actually needed to be rescued from his pleasure seeking, loveless situation. The singer accepts his loss of his \\"precious and rare\\" love as the price for his past abuses. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe the lyrics as being as frank as the lyrics of the songs on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. Ben Urish and Ken Bielen describe the lyrics as \\"bleak.\\" The title phrase incorporates a sexual pun. The phrase \\"going down on love\\" is used in the song in the context of \\"giving up on love.\\" He even adds that he \\"got to get down, down on my knees,\\" which in a literal sense would mean he is on his knees pleading for help or begging for forgiveness. But these phrases also imply a sexual act, although part of the joke seems to be that within the song neither the stated romantic longings or the implied sexual desires are fulfilled. Andrew Jackson, however, takes the title phrase combined with the pun to imply a promise by Lennon to be a better lover if Ono takes him back. \\"Going Down on Love\\" opens with a percussion accompaniment that author Andrew Jackson compares to Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" and \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),\\" albeit slower. The song alternates between slow, smooth sections and sections with a funky rhythm punctuated by bongo drums. Urish and Bielen believe that this approach generates a \\"feeling of nervous energy,\\" which they consider appropriate to the song's anxious and resigned mood. Although it is a \\"song of loss,\\" music critic Johnny Rogan states that the \\"jaunty tone\\" of the song produces an effect of irreverence and defiance. Rogan finds the two most notable elements of the song are Lennon's \\"strident\\" vocal and Bobby Keys' horn arrangement. The phrase \\"Somebody please, please help me\\" is sung to a similar melody, albeit at a slower tempo as the similar phrase Lennon sang in the Beatles' song \\"Help!\\" According to Madinger and Easter, the recording and mixing of \\"Going Down on Love\\" are crisper than on many other Lennon songs. Reception Rock journalist Paul Du Noyer notes the irony that although the lyrics contain the line \\"Nothing doin' nowhere,\\" in a creative sense there was more going on here and throughout the Walls and Bridges album than on Lennon's recordings in recent happier times. Author John Blaney notes that the song is \\"as raw and honest as anything [Lennon had] written,\\" adding that Lennon was often at his best creatively when dealing with difficulties. Madinger and Easter call it a \\"terrific LP opener.\\" Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon – vocals, guitar *Nicky Hopkins – piano *Jesse Ed Davis – electric guitar *Eddie Mottau – acoustic guitar *Ken Ascher – electric piano *Klaus Voormann – bass *Arthur Jenkins – percussion *Jim Keltner – drums *Bobby Keys, Steve Madaio, Howard Johnson, Ron Aprea, Frank Vicari – horns References External links * Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:1974 songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon Category:1985 singles ","title":"Going Down on Love"},{"id":"32544182","text":"Stefano Tomasini (born 20 August 1963) is an Italian former professional cyclist, who competed between the years of 1987 and 1990.

The Festival is held each April in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada and has been recognized as the largest annual winter sports and music festival in North America. It has been called the snowsport industry's version of Burning Man. The World Ski & Snowboard Festival was created by Doug Perry in 1996. The festival was developed in a partnership between Perry, Tourism Whistler and Whistler/Blackcomb. The inaugural WSSF in 1996 consisted of 22 sports events and competitions. In subsequent years it underwent exponential growth in attendance and media coverage, resulting in Whistler becoming the busiest mountain resort in North America in the month of April. At its peak, annual attendance reached an estimated 250,000 resort visitsand was televised in 122 countries. An Economic Impact AssessmentCanadian Sport Tourism Alliance conducted during the 2006 event found that the WSSF generated $37.7 million in economic activity for the province of British Columbia, with visitor spending and operational expenditure injecting more than $15.7 million into the Whistler economy. Over 28,000 hotel room nights were sold during the Festival, with 86% being directly attributed to WSSF. In 2006 the ownership of the festival was consolidated in a joint acquisition of Perry's ownership stake by Tourism Whistler and Whistler/Blackcomb. The predecessor to WSSF was the World Technical Skiing Championships (WTSC). WTSC was created by Doug Perry as the world's first international freeskiing competition. The first event was staged on Blackcomb Mountain in April 1994 and was televised on ESPN in the United States and its international affiliates. WTSC was designed as a made-for-tv invitational event in which world champions, Olympians and skiing legends from the sport's major disciplines vied for the title of world's best all-mountain skier in a decathlon-format competition of freeskiing, GS racing, moguls and steeps down the Saudan Couloir. WTSC was modelled after Japan's largest skiing event, the All Japan Technical Skiing Championships, in which Perry competed as a member of Team Salomon. The inaugural World Technical Skiing Championships was groundbreaking in that it drew over 100 media outlets to Whistler at a time when the resort was just beginning to emerge as an international destination. The media attention seeded the idea of developing a more diverse annual event with the potential to attract more top athletes, media and attendees to Whistler Resort. The 1996 World Ski & Snowboard Festival included the 2nd World Technical Skiing Championships, World Masters Alpine Open, Westbeach Snowboard Classic, Whistler Cup, Couloir Extreme Race and a ski industry symposium. Subsequent festivals expanded to include the Whistler Concert Series, World Skiing Invitational, World Snowboarding Invitational, World Snowboarding Championship, Kokanee Boardercross, Salomon Skiercross, Pro Photographer Showdown, Filmmaker Showdown, Brave Art, State of the Art, Fashion Exposed, Multiplicity, Intersection and many others. The World Ski & Snowboard Festival has included Canada's largest free outdoor concert series with 50 live acts per festival. Acts on the WSSF stage have included The Black Eyed Peas, Justin Timberlake, Nickelback, Michael Franti, Nas, Toots and the Maytals, and others. From 2001 through 2006, the World Ski & Snowboard was televised as a four-part series on the Global Television Network and was syndicated to 122 countries. In 2018, the World Ski & Snowboard Festival was acquired in full by Vail Resorts, Inc. upon its acquisition of Whistler Blackcomb. Vail Resorts announced WSSF would continue under new management, Crankworx Events Inc., in a shorter 6-day format, running April 10–15, 2018. Tourism Whistler relinquished its 22-year part ownership of the property. 2018 also marked the return of the Saudan Couloir Ski Race Extreme after a 20-year hiatus.Vancouver Courier In 2019, Vail Resorts, owner of Whistler Blackcomb, announced the World Ski & Snowboard Festival would be shortened to 5 days, running April 10-14. In November 2019, the World Ski & Snowboard was acquired in full by Gibbons Whistler from Whistler Blackcomb.The 2020 Festival was cancelled due to COVID-19 and the 25th Anniversary festival is scheduled for 2021.

College career Rockford College Harshbarger was able to earn a scholarship to Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois, where she played both soccer and football. Soccer She played for the Lady Regents, an NCAA Division III institution, from 2004–2005, where she was twice named All-Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference. Football She was the kicker for the football team. Benedictine University Harshbarger transferred to Benedictine University after two years at Rockford. She played football her Junior year. For soccer, she was twice again named All-NIIC. As a senior in 2007, Harshbarger had five goals and led the Benedictine team with seven assists. Professional career Chicago Cardinals In 2010, Harshbarger tried her luck with the Chicago Cardinals. After showing up to multiple tryouts, Harshbarger was cut before the season started for the Cardinals. 3 weeks into the season, the team called her back and asked for her to play due to their kicking woes. This made Harshbarger the 2nd woman ever to play in the CIFL, the first being Katie Hnida of the Fort Wayne Firehawks.FireHawks' new kicker rekindling her dream Hnida went on to make an extra point in the FireHawks opener, thus becoming the first female to ever score a point in the CIFL. Hashbarger would however, become the first ever female to make a field goal in an indoor football professional game. She connected with a 24-yard field goal against the FireHawks in a 69-45 loss. For the season she was 1 for 16 on field goal attempts and 4 for 11 on PAT's.2010 Chicago Cardinals stats Chicago Knights In 2011, she joined up with the Chicago Knights, who replaced the Cardinals in the CIFL. She saw her production take a much greater incline by making 8 of 14 field goals, 19 of 26 PAT's and lead the team in points scored with 43.2011 Chicago Knights stats Chicago Vipers On February 23, 2012, it was announced that Harshbarger had signed with the Chicago Vipers, who replaced the Chicago Knights in the CIFL. Chicago Blitz In 2014, Harshbarger signed with the Chicago Blitz, also of the CIFL. Harshbarger lead the CIFL in field goals name (5), on her way to being named CIFL Special Teams Player of the Year. Harshbarger was released on April 5, 2016. Chicago Eagles Harshbarger signed with the Chicago Eagles on May 12, 2016.

It was drafted by a committee of foreign-educated Afghans, including Sardar Abdul Hakim Ziai and Sardar Abdul Rahim Ziai, appointed for the task by Mohammed Zahir Shah. The primary goals of the Constitution were to prepare the government and the people for gradual movement toward democracy and socioeconomic modernization. A Loya jirga (grand council of notables) had debated, modified and approved its innovations, which included a bill of rights for all Afghans, explicitly including women. After public review, the constitution was put into effect in October 1964. Provisions A new parliament was created, dominated by its lower house (the Wolesi Jirgah), which was to be elected through universal suffrage. It had the power to reject royal appointments to the cabinet and to dismiss it by a vote of no confidence. Laws passed by parliament were to have constitutional precedence over traditional Islamic law (the Sharia). Parliament was to meet regularly, not at royal pleasure as before. It could refuse budget increases, but could not reduce appropriations below the level of the previous year. Its members had control over the organization of parliament and enjoyed legal immunity for what they said in debate. Members had the right to form political parties, but their formation required legislation acceptable to the cabinet and, hence, the king. Bold as its innovations were compared with the functional autocracy it replaced, the constitution was filled with provisions intended to assure that the royal government would not lose control. A wide constitutional gulf separated the cabinet from the parliament. The cabinet was to exercise the monarch's powers, including the initiation of all government policy and the invocation of emergency decrees. Cooperation between officials and legislators, integral to classical parliamentary systems, was discouraged. Legislators were prohibited from holding ministerial or other executive positions. The cabinet was assured control over the composition of the Meshrano Jirgah, the parliament's upper house. Judicial restructuring and elective provincial councils were endorsed, but the constitution did not prescribe their structure or working arrangements. The failure to spell out a complete structure for the government lent a provisional character to the constitution. At least seventy articles required parliamentary legislation in order for them to take effect. The constitution's democratic features were especially provisional. Ample authority was retained for the executive branch to slow, halt or reverse legislation. Nor was caution only displayed toward would-be overweening legislators. The most notorious provision in the constitution was its prohibition of official or political activity by any member of the royal family other than the monarch. The implications of this clause would soon haunt the constitutionalists. No means was provided for an increasingly restless Muhammad Daud to return to power without nullifying the constitution. Impact and evaluation Shortly after its enactment, the vulnerability of the constitution to political realities became dramatically clear. The adversarial relationship it created between the cabinet and the parliament brought about tragedy and a serious loss of political momentum. In October 1965, following the election of the new legislature, an impasse over its approval of the new cabinet brought about rioting and intervention by the army leading to the death of at least three student demonstrators. The proposed cabinet was withdrawn, following which a reshuffled one under the leadership of Muhammad Hashim Maiwandwal, a senior diplomat, was approved with little opposition. Officials and legislators were faced with running the new system with hopes considerably dampened. The liberal or constitutional experiment, which lasted for the next eight years, has been generally seen as a political failure. The cabinet and legislature were constantly deadlocked, unable to enact laws vital to the constitution or seriously weakening it through long delays. Legislators proved to be effective critics of the bureaucracy, which responded by holding back legislation to avoid scrutiny or lengthy disputes. There was a wide social and cultural gap between the legislators and senior ministry officials. Few of the former had had the exposure to the modern education and foreign experience enjoyed by senior ministry officials. More than 90 percent of the Wolesi Jirgah members represented rural constituencies. Legislators had the right to lobby ministers and senior bureaucrats directly. Doing so was more rewarding than dealing with middle rank provincial officials who had less authority and information. The constitution discouraged executive-legislative cooperation on policy, but it did not prevent the give and take of patronage.

Biography After training to be a ballet dancer and also exploring the American dance tradition, Vo-Dinh expanded her learning experience at the Merce Cunningham School in New York. Back in France, she danced with François Raffinot from 1991 to 1996. In 1997, she founded the Sui Generis company. She was noticed early on for her distinctive style. In 1999, she was awarded a Villa Medicis Hors-les murs grant for her research in creating Texture/Composite, for which she was awarded the Prix d’Auteur at the Rencontres chorégraphiques internationales de Bagnolet in 2000. The piece was subsequently presented at Danspace Project in New York in 2002. Since then her productions have been presented on a regular basis both in France and abroad. In January 2012, Vo- Dinh became the director of Le Phare, Centre Chorégraphique National du Havre Haute-Normandie, ushering in a new artistic vision that has reached out to a diversity of choreographic styles. Vo-Dinh's wide-ranging choreography has been shaped through the process of creating new work. While she initially focused on choreographing in a more formal way, her methodology gradually evolved toward an open-ended process affording a prominent role to improvisation in the studio. Surrounded by close collaborators, Vo-Dinh works with her performers on a long-term basis. Several pieces have been deeply rooted in scientific and anthropological research on human beings, romantic relationships, absence, the lack of emotion and schizophrenia. The art world has also informed her work: between figurative and abstract in the visual arts, as well as in the relationship between bodies in motion and the music of Beethoven, Dusapin, Zeena Parkins or Gérard Grisey. Although the choreographic structure often draws on minimalism to the point of repeating and transforming a single motif, Vo-Dinh has mainly focused on time, how it is perceived and its relationship to memory and memories. After a long absence, fragmented narration has surfaced in her latest pieces – a new approach to time and point of view, as well as to the body and how it relates to others. Vo-Dinh readily accepts invitations, including Rainbow, her piece for amateur dancers in collaboration with David Monceau, and her work with the writer Jérôme Mauche for Concordanse. Beginning with Histoires Exquises in 2011, she has invited choreographers to create solos from oral testimonies, the starting point for opening up the creative process to audiences. That willingness to share and her curiosity about other approaches to dance were to be the leitmotif in her vision for the CCN du Havre. Since 2012, Vo-Dinh has endeavored to make Le Phare a platform for many different kinds of choreography – during key moments such as the Pharenheit festival, as well as throughout the year, bringing the CCN to life in order to showcase dance in all it vibrancy. Since 2014, she has been the president of the Association des Centres Chorégraphiques Nationaux, a network comprising nineteen national choreographic centers in France. Vo-Dinh was awarded the insignia of Chevalier de l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres in July 2014.

The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas, petroleum, and brine will flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants (either sand or aluminium oxide) hold the fractures open. Hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947, and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950. As of 2012, 2.5 million \\"frac jobs\\" had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells; over one million of those within the U.S. Such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in shale gas, tight gas, tight oil, and coal seam gas wells. Some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain veins or dikes. Drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the United States a major crude oil exporter as of 2019, but leakage of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has dramatically increased. Increased oil and gas production from the decade-long fracking boom has led to lower prices for consumers, with near-record lows of the share of household income going to energy expenditures. Hydraulic fracturing is highly controversial. Its proponents advocate the economic benefits of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons,Hillard Huntington et al. EMF 26: Changing the Game? Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies Report. Stanford University. Energy Modeling Forum, 2013. as well as replacing coal with natural gas, which burns more cleanly and emits less carbon dioxide (CO2). Opponents of fracking argue that these are outweighed by the environmental impacts, which include groundwater and surface water contamination, noise and air pollution, and the triggering of earthquakes, along with the resulting hazards to public health and the environment. Research has determined that human health is affected, including confirmation of chemical, physical, and psychosocial hazards such as pregnancy and birth outcomes, migraine headaches, chronic rhinosinusitis, severe fatigue, asthma exacerbations, and psychological stress. Groundwater contamination has been documented. Adherence to regulation and safety procedures are required to avoid further negative impacts. There is considerable uncertainty about the scale of methane leakage associated with hydraulic fracturing, and even some evidence that leakage may cancel out the greenhouse gas emissions benefits of natural gas relative to other fossil fuels. For example, a report by Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) highlights this issue, focusing on the leakage rate in Pennsylvania during extensive testing and analysis was found to be approximately 10%, or over five times the reported figures. This leakage rate is considered representative of the hydraulic fracturing industry in the US generally. EDF has recently announced a satellite mission to further locate and measure methane emissions. Increases in seismic activity following hydraulic fracturing along dormant or previously unknown faults are sometimes caused by the deep-injection disposal of hydraulic fracturing flowback (a byproduct of hydraulically fractured wells), and produced formation brine (a byproduct of both fractured and nonfractured oil and gas wells).US Geological Survey, Produced water, overview, accessed 8 November 2014. For these reasons, hydraulic fracturing is under international scrutiny, restricted in some countries, and banned altogether in others. The European Union is drafting regulations that would permit the controlled application of hydraulic fracturing. Geology Halliburton fracturing operation in the Bakken Formation, North Dakota, United States A fracturing operation in progress Mechanics Fracturing rocks at great depth frequently becomes suppressed by pressure due to the weight of the overlying rock strata and the cementation of the formation. This suppression process is particularly significant in \\"tensile\\" (Mode 1) fractures which require the walls of the fracture to move against this pressure. Fracturing occurs when effective stress is overcome by the pressure of fluids within the rock.The minimum principal stress becomes tensile and exceeds the tensile strength of the material. Fractures formed in this way are generally oriented in a plane perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, and for this reason, hydraulic fractures in well bores can be used to determine the orientation of stresses. In natural examples, such as dikes or vein-filled fractures, the orientations can be used to infer past states of stress. Veins Most mineral vein systems are a result of repeated natural fracturing during periods of relatively high pore fluid pressure. The impact of high pore fluid pressure on the formation process of mineral vein systems is particularly evident in \\"crack-seal\\" veins, where the vein material is part of a series of discrete fracturing events, and extra vein material is deposited on each occasion. One example of long-term repeated natural fracturing is in the effects of seismic activity. Stress levels rise and fall episodically, and earthquakes can cause large volumes of connate water to be expelled from fluid-filled fractures. This process is referred to as \\"seismic pumping\\". Dikes Minor intrusions in the upper part of the crust, such as dikes, propagate in the form of fluid-filled cracks. In such cases, the fluid is magma. In sedimentary rocks with a significant water content, fluid at fracture tip will be steam.  History   Precursors  Fracturing as a method to stimulate shallow, hard rock oil wells dates back to the 1860s. Dynamite or nitroglycerin detonations were used to increase oil and natural gas production from petroleum bearing formations. On 24 April 1865, US Civil War veteran Col. Edward A. L. Roberts received a patent for an \\"exploding torpedo\\". It was employed in Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, and West Virginia using liquid and also, later, solidified nitroglycerin. Later still the same method was applied to water and gas wells. Stimulation of wells with acid, instead of explosive fluids, was introduced in the 1930s. Due to acid etching, fractures would not close completely resulting in further productivity increase.  20th century applications  Harold Hamm, Aubrey McClendon, Tom Ward and George P. Mitchell are each considered to have pioneered hydraulic fracturing innovations toward practical applications.Khan, Salmaan A. \\"Government Roads, Subsidies, and the Costs of Fracking\\", Mises Institute, 19 June 2014.

Oil and gas wells  The relationship between well performance and treatment pressures was studied by Floyd Farris of Stanolind Oil and Gas Corporation. This study was the basis of the first hydraulic fracturing experiment, conducted in 1947 at the Hugoton gas field in Grant County of southwestern Kansas by Stanolind. For the well treatment, of gelled gasoline (essentially napalm) and sand from the Arkansas River was injected into the gas-producing limestone formation at . The experiment was not very successful as deliverability of the well did not change appreciably. The process was further described by J.B. Clark of Stanolind in his paper published in 1948. A patent on this process was issued in 1949 and exclusive license was granted to the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company. On 17 March 1949, Halliburton performed the first two commercial hydraulic fracturing treatments in Stephens County, Oklahoma, and Archer County, Texas. Since then, hydraulic fracturing has been used to stimulate approximately one million oil and gas wells in various geologic regimes with good success. In contrast with large-scale hydraulic fracturing used in low-permeability formations, small hydraulic fracturing treatments are commonly used in high-permeability formations to remedy \\"skin damage\\", a low-permeability zone that sometimes forms at the rock-borehole interface. In such cases the fracturing may extend only a few feet from the borehole.A. J. Stark, A. Settari, J. R. Jones, Analysis of Hydraulic Fracturing of High Permeability Gas Wells to Reduce Non- darcy Skin Effects, Petroleum Society of Canada, Annual Technical Meeting, 8 – 10 June 1998, Calgary, Alberta. In the Soviet Union, the first hydraulic proppant fracturing was carried out in 1952. Other countries in Europe and Northern Africa subsequently employed hydraulic fracturing techniques including Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia(before 1989), Yugoslavia(before 1991), Hungary, Austria, France, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Tunisia, and Algeria.  Massive fracturing  Well head where fluids are injected into the ground Well head after all the hydraulic fracturing equipment has been taken off location Massive hydraulic fracturing (also known as high- volume hydraulic fracturing) is a technique first applied by Pan American Petroleum in Stephens County, Oklahoma, USA in 1968. The definition of massive hydraulic fracturing varies, but generally refers to treatments injecting over 150 short tons, or approximately 300,000 pounds (136 metric tonnes), of proppant.Ben E. Law and Charles W. Spencer, 1993, \\"Gas in tight reservoirs-an emerging major source of energy,\\" in David G. Howell (ed.), The Future of Energy Gasses, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1570, p.233-252. American geologists gradually became aware that there were huge volumes of gas-saturated sandstones with permeability too low (generally less than 0.1 millidarcy) to recover the gas economically. Starting in 1973, massive hydraulic fracturing was used in thousands of gas wells in the San Juan Basin, Denver Basin,C.R. Fast, G.B. Holman, and R. J. Covlin, \\"The application of massive hydraulic fracturing to the tight Muddy 'J' Formation, Wattenberg Field, Colorado,\\" in Harry K. Veal, (ed.), Exploration Frontiers of the Central and Southern Rockies (Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, 1977) 293–300. the Piceance Basin,Robert Chancellor, \\"Mesaverde hydraulic fracture stimulation, northern Piceance Basin – progress report,\\" in Harry K. Veal, (ed.), Exploration Frontiers of the Central and Southern Rockies (Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, 1977) 285–291. and the Green River Basin, and in other hard rock formations of the western US. Other tight sandstone wells in the US made economically viable by massive hydraulic fracturing were in the Clinton-Medina Sandstone (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York), and Cotton Valley Sandstone (Texas and Louisiana). Massive hydraulic fracturing quickly spread in the late 1970s to western Canada, Rotliegend and Carboniferous gas-bearing sandstones in Germany, Netherlands (onshore and offshore gas fields), and the United Kingdom in the North Sea. Horizontal oil or gas wells were unusual until the late 1980s. Then, operators in Texas began completing thousands of oil wells by drilling horizontally in the Austin Chalk, and giving massive slickwater hydraulic fracturing treatments to the wellbores. Horizontal wells proved much more effective than vertical wells in producing oil from tight chalk;C.E Bell and others, Effective diverting in horizontal wells in the Austin Chalk, Society of Petroleum Engineers conference paper, 1993. sedimentary beds are usually nearly horizontal, so horizontal wells have much larger contact areas with the target formation. Hydraulic fracturing operations have grown exponentially since the mid-1990s, when technologic advances and increases in the price of natural gas made this technique economically viable.  Shales  Hydraulic fracturing of shales goes back at least to 1965, when some operators in the Big Sandy gas field of eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia started hydraulically fracturing the Ohio Shale and Cleveland Shale, using relatively small fracs. The frac jobs generally increased production, especially from lower-yielding wells.E. O. Ray, Shale development in eastern Kentucky, US Energy Research and Development Administration, 1976. In 1976, the United States government started the Eastern Gas Shales Project, which included numerous public-private hydraulic fracturing demonstration projects.US Dept. of Energy, How is shale gas produced?, Apr. 2013. During the same period, the Gas Research Institute, a gas industry research consortium, received approval for research and funding from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In 1997, Nick Steinsberger, an engineer of Mitchell Energy (now part of Devon Energy), applied the slickwater fracturing technique, using more water and higher pump pressure than previous fracturing techniques, which was used in East Texas in the Barnett Shale of north Texas. In 1998, the new technique proved to be successful when the first 90 days gas production from the well called S.H. Griffin No. 3 exceeded production of any of the company's previous wells. This new completion technique made gas extraction widely economical in the Barnett Shale, and was later applied to other shales, including the Eagle Ford and Bakken Shale. George P. Mitchell has been called the \\"father of fracking\\" because of his role in applying it in shales. The first horizontal well in the Barnett Shale was drilled in 1991, but was not widely done in the Barnett until it was demonstrated that gas could be economically extracted from vertical wells in the Barnett. As of 2013, massive hydraulic fracturing is being applied on a commercial scale to shales in the United States, Canada, and China. Several additional countries are planning to use hydraulic fracturing.  Process  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), hydraulic fracturing is a process to stimulate a natural gas, oil, or geothermal well to maximize extraction. The EPA defines the broader process to include acquisition of source water, well construction, well stimulation, and waste disposal. Method A hydraulic fracture is formed by pumping fracturing fluid into a wellbore at a rate sufficient to increase pressure at the target depth (determined by the location of the well casing perforations), to exceed that of the fracture gradient (pressure gradient) of the rock. The fracture gradient is defined as pressure increase per unit of depth relative to density, and is usually measured in pounds per square inch, per square foot, or bars. The rock cracks, and the fracture fluid permeates the rock extending the crack further, and further, and so on. Fractures are localized as pressure drops off with the rate of frictional loss, which is relative to the distance from the well. Operators typically try to maintain \\"fracture width\\", or slow its decline following treatment, by introducing a proppant into the injected fluida material such as grains of sand, ceramic, or other particulate, thus preventing the fractures from closing when injection is stopped and pressure removed. Consideration of proppant strength and prevention of proppant failure becomes more important at greater depths where pressure and stresses on fractures are higher. The propped fracture is permeable enough to allow the flow of gas, oil, salt water and hydraulic fracturing fluids to the well. During the process, fracturing fluid leakoff (loss of fracturing fluid from the fracture channel into the surrounding permeable rock) occurs. If not controlled, it can exceed 70% of the injected volume. This may result in formation matrix damage, adverse formation fluid interaction, and altered fracture geometry, thereby decreasing efficiency. The location of one or more fractures along the length of the borehole is strictly controlled by various methods that create or seal holes in the side of the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing is performed in cased wellbores, and the zones to be fractured are accessed by perforating the casing at those locations. Hydraulic-fracturing equipment used in oil and natural gas fields usually consists of a slurry blender, one or more high- pressure, high-volume fracturing pumps (typically powerful triplex or quintuplex pumps) and a monitoring unit. Associated equipment includes fracturing tanks, one or more units for storage and handling of proppant, high-pressure treating iron, a chemical additive unit (used to accurately monitor chemical addition), low-pressure flexible hoses, and many gauges and meters for flow rate, fluid density, and treating pressure. Chemical additives are typically 0.5% of the total fluid volume. Fracturing equipment operates over a range of pressures and injection rates, and can reach up to and (100 barrels per minute). Well types A distinction can be made between conventional, low-volume hydraulic fracturing, used to stimulate high- permeability reservoirs for a single well, and unconventional, high-volume hydraulic fracturing, used in the completion of tight gas and shale gas wells. High-volume hydraulic fracturing usually requires higher pressures than low- volume fracturing; the higher pressures are needed to push out larger volumes of fluid and proppant that extend farther from the borehole. Horizontal drilling involves wellbores with a terminal drillhole completed as a \\"lateral\\" that extends parallel with the rock layer containing the substance to be extracted. For example, laterals extend in the Barnett Shale basin in Texas, and up to in the Bakken formation in North Dakota. In contrast, a vertical well only accesses the thickness of the rock layer, typically . Horizontal drilling reduces surface disruptions as fewer wells are required to access the same volume of rock. Drilling often plugs up the pore spaces at the wellbore wall, reducing permeability at and near the wellbore. This reduces flow into the borehole from the surrounding rock formation, and partially seals off the borehole from the surrounding rock. Low-volume hydraulic fracturing can be used to restore permeability. Fracturing fluids Water tanks preparing for hydraulic fracturing The main purposes of fracturing fluid are to extend fractures, add lubrication, change gel strength, and to carry proppant into the formation. There are two methods of transporting proppant in the fluidhigh-rate and high-viscosity. High-viscosity fracturing tends to cause large dominant fractures, while high-rate (slickwater) fracturing causes small spread-out micro-fractures. Water-soluble gelling agents (such as guar gum) increase viscosity and efficiently deliver proppant into the formation. Example of high pressure manifold combining pump flows before injection into well Fluid is typically a slurry of water, proppant, and chemical additives. Additionally, gels, foams, and compressed gases, including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and air can be injected. Typically, 90% of the fluid is water and 9.5% is sand with chemical additives accounting to about 0.5%. However, fracturing fluids have been developed using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propane in which water is unnecessary. The proppant is a granular material that prevents the created fractures from closing after the fracturing treatment. Types of proppant include silica sand, resin-coated sand, bauxite, and man-made ceramics. The choice of proppant depends on the type of permeability or grain strength needed. In some formations, where the pressure is great enough to crush grains of natural silica sand, higher-strength proppants such as bauxite or ceramics may be used. The most commonly used proppant is silica sand, though proppants of uniform size and shape, such as a ceramic proppant, are believed to be more effective. USGS map of water use from hydraulic fracturing between 2011 and 2014. One cubic meter of water is 264.172 gallons. The fracturing fluid varies depending on fracturing type desired, and the conditions of specific wells being fractured, and water characteristics. The fluid can be gel, foam, or slickwater-based. Fluid choices are tradeoffs: more viscous fluids, such as gels, are better at keeping proppant in suspension; while less-viscous and lower-friction fluids, such as slickwater, allow fluid to be pumped at higher rates, to create fractures farther out from the wellbore. Important material properties of the fluid include viscosity, pH, various rheological factors, and others. Water is mixed with sand and chemicals to create hydraulic fracturing fluid. Approximately 40,000 gallons of chemicals are used per fracturing. A typical fracture treatment uses between 3 and 12 additive chemicals. Although there may be unconventional fracturing fluids, typical chemical additives can include one or more of the following: * Acids—hydrochloric acid or acetic acid is used in the pre- fracturing stage for cleaning the perforations and initiating fissure in the near-wellbore rock. * Sodium chloride (salt)—delays breakdown of gel polymer chains. * Polyacrylamide and other friction reducers decrease turbulence in fluid flow and pipe friction, thus allowing the pumps to pump at a higher rate without having greater pressure on the surface. * Ethylene glycol—prevents formation of scale deposits in the pipe. * Borate salts—used for maintaining fluid viscosity during the temperature increase. * Sodium and potassium carbonates—used for maintaining effectiveness of crosslinkers. * Anaerobic, Biocide, BIO—Glutaraldehyde used as disinfectant of the water (bacteria elimination). * Guar gum and other water-soluble gelling agents—increases viscosity of the fracturing fluid to deliver proppant into the formation more efficiently. * Citric acid—used for corrosion prevention. * Isopropanol—used to winterize the chemicals to ensure it doesn't freeze. The most common chemical used for hydraulic fracturing in the United States in 2005–2009 was methanol, while some other most widely used chemicals were isopropyl alcohol, 2-butoxyethanol, and ethylene glycol. Typical fluid types are: * Conventional linear gels. These gels are cellulose derivative (carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose), guar or its derivatives (hydroxypropyl guar, carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar), mixed with other chemicals. * Borate-crosslinked fluids. These are guar-based fluids cross- linked with boron ions (from aqueous borax/boric acid solution). These gels have higher viscosity at pH 9 onwards and are used to carry proppant. After the fracturing job, the pH is reduced to 3–4 so that the cross-links are broken, and the gel is less viscous and can be pumped out. * Organometallic- crosslinked fluids – zirconium, chromium, antimony, titanium salts – are known to crosslink guar-based gels. The crosslinking mechanism is not reversible, so once the proppant is pumped down along with cross-linked gel, the fracturing part is done. The gels are broken down with appropriate breakers. * Aluminium phosphate-ester oil gels. Aluminium phosphate and ester oils are slurried to form cross-linked gel. These are one of the first known gelling systems. For slickwater fluids the use of sweeps is common. Sweeps are temporary reductions in the proppant concentration, which help ensure that the well is not overwhelmed with proppant. As the fracturing process proceeds, viscosity- reducing agents such as oxidizers and enzyme breakers are sometimes added to the fracturing fluid to deactivate the gelling agents and encourage flowback. Such oxidizers react with and break down the gel, reducing the fluid's viscosity and ensuring that no proppant is pulled from the formation. An enzyme acts as a catalyst for breaking down the gel. Sometimes pH modifiers are used to break down the crosslink at the end of a hydraulic fracturing job, since many require a pH buffer system to stay viscous. At the end of the job, the well is commonly flushed with water under pressure (sometimes blended with a friction reducing chemical.) Some (but not all) injected fluid is recovered. This fluid is managed by several methods, including underground injection control, treatment, discharge, recycling, and temporary storage in pits or containers. New technology is continually developing to better handle waste water and improve re-usability. Fracture monitoring Measurements of the pressure and rate during the growth of a hydraulic fracture, with knowledge of fluid properties and proppant being injected into the well, provides the most common and simplest method of monitoring a hydraulic fracture treatment. This data along with knowledge of the underground geology can be used to model information such as length, width and conductivity of a propped fracture. Injection of radioactive tracers along with the fracturing fluid is sometimes used to determine the injection profile and location of created fractures. Radiotracers are selected to have the readily detectable radiation, appropriate chemical properties, and a half life and toxicity level that will minimize initial and residual contamination. Radioactive isotopes chemically bonded to glass (sand) and/or resin beads may also be injected to track fractures. For example, plastic pellets coated with 10 GBq of Ag-110mm may be added to the proppant, or sand may be labelled with Ir-192, so that the proppant's progress can be monitored. Radiotracers such as Tc-99m and I-131 are also used to measure flow rates. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission publishes guidelines which list a wide range of radioactive materials in solid, liquid and gaseous forms that may be used as tracers and limit the amount that may be used per injection and per well of each radionuclide. A new technique in well-monitoring involves fiber-optic cables outside the casing. Using the fiber optics, temperatures can be measured every foot along the well – even while the wells are being fracked and pumped. By monitoring the temperature of the well, engineers can determine how much hydraulic fracturing fluid different parts of the well use as well as how much natural gas or oil they collect, during hydraulic fracturing operation and when the well is producing.  Microseismic monitoring  For more advanced applications, microseismic monitoring is sometimes used to estimate the size and orientation of induced fractures. Microseismic activity is measured by placing an array of geophones in a nearby wellbore. By mapping the location of any small seismic events associated with the growing fracture, the approximate geometry of the fracture is inferred. Tiltmeter arrays deployed on the surface or down a well provide another technology for monitoring strain Microseismic mapping is very similar geophysically to seismology. In earthquake seismology, seismometers scattered on or near the surface of the earth record S-waves and P-waves that are released during an earthquake event. This allows for motion along the fault plane to be estimated and its location in the Earth's subsurface mapped. Hydraulic fracturing, an increase in formation stress proportional to the net fracturing pressure, as well as an increase in pore pressure due to leakoff. Tensile stresses are generated ahead of the fracture's tip, generating large amounts of shear stress. The increases in pore water pressure and in formation stress combine and affect weaknesses near the hydraulic fracture, like natural fractures, joints, and bedding planes. Different methods have different location errors and advantages. Accuracy of microseismic event mapping is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio and the distribution of sensors. Accuracy of events located by seismic inversion is improved by sensors placed in multiple azimuths from the monitored borehole. In a downhole array location, accuracy of events is improved by being close to the monitored borehole (high signal-to-noise ratio). Monitoring of microseismic events induced by reservoir stimulation has become a key aspect in evaluation of hydraulic fractures, and their optimization. The main goal of hydraulic fracture monitoring is to completely characterize the induced fracture structure, and distribution of conductivity within a formation. Geomechanical analysis, such as understanding a formations material properties, in-situ conditions, and geometries, helps monitoring by providing a better definition of the environment in which the fracture network propagates. The next task is to know the location of proppant within the fracture and the distribution of fracture conductivity. This can be monitored using multiple types of techniques to finally develop a reservoir model than accurately predicts well performance. Horizontal completions Since the early 2000s, advances in drilling and completion technology have made horizontal wellbores much more economical. Horizontal wellbores allow far greater exposure to a formation than conventional vertical wellbores. This is particularly useful in shale formations which do not have sufficient permeability to produce economically with a vertical well. Such wells, when drilled onshore, are now usually hydraulically fractured in a number of stages, especially in North America. The type of wellbore completion is used to determine how many times a formation is fractured, and at what locations along the horizontal section. In North America, shale reservoirs such as the Bakken, Barnett, Montney, Haynesville, Marcellus, and most recently the Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Utica shales are drilled horizontally through the producing interval(s), completed and fractured. The method by which the fractures are placed along the wellbore is most commonly achieved by one of two methods, known as \\"plug and perf\\" and \\"sliding sleeve\\". The wellbore for a plug-and-perf job is generally composed of standard steel casing, cemented or uncemented, set in the drilled hole. Once the drilling rig has been removed, a wireline truck is used to perforate near the bottom of the well, and then fracturing fluid is pumped. Then the wireline truck sets a plug in the well to temporarily seal off that section so the next section of the wellbore can be treated. Another stage is pumped, and the process is repeated along the horizontal length of the wellbore. The wellbore for the sliding sleeve technique is different in that the sliding sleeves are included at set spacings in the steel casing at the time it is set in place. The sliding sleeves are usually all closed at this time. When the well is due to be fractured, the bottom sliding sleeve is opened using one of several activation techniques and the first stage gets pumped. Once finished, the next sleeve is opened, concurrently isolating the previous stage, and the process repeats. For the sliding sleeve method, wireline is usually not required. Sleeves These completion techniques may allow for more than 30 stages to be pumped into the horizontal section of a single well if required, which is far more than would typically be pumped into a vertical well that had far fewer feet of producing zone exposed.  Uses  Hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the rate at which fluids, such as petroleum, water, or natural gas can be recovered from subterranean natural reservoirs. Reservoirs are typically porous sandstones, limestones or dolomite rocks, but also include \\"unconventional reservoirs\\" such as shale rock or coal beds. Hydraulic fracturing enables the extraction of natural gas and oil from rock formations deep below the earth's surface (generally ), which is greatly below typical groundwater reservoir levels. At such depth, there may be insufficient permeability or reservoir pressure to allow natural gas and oil to flow from the rock into the wellbore at high economic return. Thus, creating conductive fractures in the rock is instrumental in extraction from naturally impermeable shale reservoirs. Permeability is measured in the microdarcy to nanodarcy range. Fractures are a conductive path connecting a larger volume of reservoir to the well. So-called \\"super fracking,\\" creates cracks deeper in the rock formation to release more oil and gas, and increases efficiency. The yield for typical shale bores generally falls off after the first year or two, but the peak producing life of a well can be extended to several decades. While the main industrial use of hydraulic fracturing is in stimulating production from oil and gas wells, hydraulic fracturing is also applied: * To stimulate groundwater wells * To precondition or induce rock cave-ins mining * As a means of enhancing waste remediation, usually hydrocarbon waste or spills * To dispose waste by injection deep into rock * To measure stress in the Earth * For electricity generation in enhanced geothermal systems * To increase injection rates for geologic sequestration of Since the late 1970s, hydraulic fracturing has been used, in some cases, to increase the yield of drinking water from wells in a number of countries, including the United States, Australia, and South Africa. Economic effects Production costs for unconventional oil and gas continue to outweigh profits Hydraulic fracturing has been seen as one of the key methods of extracting unconventional oil and unconventional gas resources. According to the International Energy Agency, the remaining technically recoverable resources of shale gas are estimated to amount to , tight gas to , and coalbed methane to . As a rule, formations of these resources have lower permeability than conventional gas formations. Therefore, depending on the geological characteristics of the formation, specific technologies such as hydraulic fracturing are required. Although there are also other methods to extract these resources, such as conventional drilling or horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing is one of the key methods making their extraction economically viable. The multi-stage fracturing technique has facilitated the development of shale gas and light tight oil production in the United States and is believed to do so in the other countries with unconventional hydrocarbon resources. A large majority of studies indicate that hydraulic fracturing in the United States has had a strong positive economic benefit so far. The Brookings Institution estimates that the benefits of Shale Gas alone has led to a net economic benefit of $48 billion per year. Most of this benefit is within the consumer and industrial sectors due to the significantly reduced prices for natural gas. Other studies have suggested that the economic benefits are outweighed by the externalities and that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from less carbon and water intensive sources is lower.Phillips. K. (2012). What is the True Cost of Hydraulic Fracturing? Incorporating Negative Externalities into the Cost of America’s Latest Energy Alternative. Journal of Environmental Sciences Program. 2,1st Edition, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC The primary benefit of hydraulic fracturing is to offset imports of natural gas and oil, where the cost paid to producers otherwise exits the domestic economy. However, shale oil and gas is highly subsidisied in the US, and has not yet covered production costs – meaning that the cost of hydraulic fracturing is paid for in income taxes, and in many cases is up to double the cost paid at the pump. Research suggests that hydraulic fracturing wells have an adverse impact on agricultural productivity in the vicinity of the wells. One paper found \\"that productivity of an irrigated crop decreases by 5.7% when a well is drilled during the agriculturally active months within 11–20 km radius of a producing township. This effect becomes smaller and weaker as the distance between township and wells increases.\\" The findings imply that the introduction of hydraulic fracturing wells to Alberta cost the province $14.8 million in 2014 due to the decline in the crop productivity, The Energy Information Administration of the US Department of Energy estimates that 45% of US gas supply will come from shale gas by 2035 (with the vast majority of this replacing conventional gas, which has a lower greenhouse-gas footprint). Public debate Poster against hydraulic fracturing in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain, 2012) Placard against hydraulic fracturing at Extinction Rebellion (2018) Politics and public policy An anti-fracking movement has emerged both internationally with involvement of international environmental organizations and nations such as France and locally in affected areas such as Balcombe in Sussex where the Balcombe drilling protest was in progress during mid-2013. The considerable opposition against hydraulic fracturing activities in local townships in the United States has led companies to adopt a variety of public relations measures to reassure the public, including the employment of former military personnel with training in psychological warfare operations. According to Matt Pitzarella, the communications director at Range Resources, employees trained in the Middle East have been valuable to Range Resources in Pennsylvania, when dealing with emotionally charged township meetings and advising townships on zoning and local ordinances dealing with hydraulic fracturing. There have been many protests directed at hydraulic fracturing. For example, ten people were arrested in 2013 during an anti- fracking protest near New Matamoras, Ohio, after they illegally entered a development zone and latched themselves to drilling equipment. In northwest Pennsylvania, there was a drive-by shooting at a well site, in which someone shot two rounds of a small-caliber rifle in the direction of a drilling rig, before shouting profanities at the site and fleeing the scene. In Washington County, Pennsylvania, a contractor working on a gas pipeline found a pipe bomb that had been placed where a pipeline was to be constructed, which local authorities said would have caused a \\"catastrophe\\" had they not discovered and detonated it. In 2014 a number of European officials suggested that several major European protests against hydraulic fracturing (with mixed success in Lithuania and Ukraine) may be partially sponsored by Gazprom, Russia's state- controlled gas company. The New York Times suggested that Russia saw its natural gas exports to Europe as a key element of its geopolitical influence, and that this market would diminish if hydraulic fracturing is adopted in Eastern Europe, as it opens up significant shale gas reserves in the region. Russian officials have on numerous occasions made public statements to the effect that hydraulic fracturing \\"poses a huge environmental problem\\". Hydraulic fracturing is currently taking place in the United States in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Other states, such as Alabama, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio, are either considering or preparing for drilling using this method. Marylandhttps://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2017/04/04/with-governors- signature-maryland-becomes-third-state-to-ban-fracking/ and Vermont have permanently banned hydraulic fracturing, and New York and North Carolina have instituted temporary bans. New Jersey currently has a bill before its legislature to extend a 2012 moratorium on hydraulic fracturing that recently expired. Although a hydraulic fracturing moratorium was recently lifted in the United Kingdom, the government is proceeding cautiously because of concerns about earthquakes and the environmental impact of drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is currently banned in France and Bulgaria. In December 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency issued the \\"Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States (Final Report).\\" The EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Documentary films Josh Fox's 2010 Academy Award nominated film GaslandDocumentary: Gasland (2010). 104 minutes. became a center of opposition to hydraulic fracturing of shale. The movie presented problems with groundwater contamination near well sites in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and Colorado. Energy in Depth, an oil and gas industry lobbying group, called the film's facts into question. In response, a rebuttal of Energy in Depth's claims of inaccuracy was posted on Gasland's website. The Director of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) offered to be interviewed as part of the film if he could review what was included from the interview in the final film but Fox declined the offer. Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips aired advertisements during 2011 and 2012 that claimed to describe the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and argue that hydraulic fracturing was safe. The 2012 film Promised Land, starring Matt Damon, takes on hydraulic fracturing. The gas industry countered the film's criticisms of hydraulic fracturing with informational flyers, and Twitter and Facebook posts. In January 2013, Northern Irish journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer released a crowdfundedKickstarter, FrackNation by Ann and Phelim Media LLC, 6 April 2012 documentary called FrackNation as a response to the statements made by Fox in Gasland, claiming it \\"tells the truth about fracking for natural gas\\". FrackNation premiered on Mark Cuban's AXS TV. The premiere corresponded with the release of Promised Land.The Hollywood Reporter, Mark Cuban's AXS TV Picks Up Pro-Fracking Documentary 'FrackNation', 17 December 2012 In April 2013, Josh Fox released Gasland 2, his \\"international odyssey uncovering a trail of secrets, lies and contamination related to hydraulic fracking\\". It challenges the gas industry's portrayal of natural gas as a clean and safe alternative to oil as a myth, and that hydraulically fractured wells inevitably leak over time, contaminating water and air, hurting families, and endangering the earth's climate with the potent greenhouse gas methane. In 2014, Scott Cannon of Video Innovations released the documentary The Ethics of Fracking. The film covers the politics, spiritual, scientific, medical and professional points of view on hydraulic fracturing. It also digs into the way the gas industry portrays hydraulic fracturing in their advertising. In 2015, the Canadian documentary film Fractured Land had its world premiere at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. Research issues Typically the funding source of the research studies is a focal point of controversy. Concerns have been raised about research funded by foundations and corporations, or by environmental groups, which can at times lead to at least the appearance of unreliable studies. Several organizations, researchers, and media outlets have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry and governmental pressure, and expressed concern over possible censoring of environmental reports. Some have argued there is a need for more research into the environmental and health effects of the technique.  Anti-fracking banner at the Clean Energy March (Philadelphia, 2016) There is concern over the possible adverse public health implications of hydraulic fracturing activity. A 2013 review on shale gas production in the United States stated, \\"with increasing numbers of drilling sites, more people are at risk from accidents and exposure to harmful substances used at fractured wells.\\" A 2011 hazard assessment recommended full disclosure of chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing and drilling as many have immediate health effects, and many may have long-term health effects. In June 2014 Public Health England published a review of the potential public health impacts of exposures to chemical and radioactive pollutants as a result of shale gas extraction in the UK, based on the examination of literature and data from countries where hydraulic fracturing already occurs. The executive summary of the report stated: \\"An assessment of the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. Most evidence suggests that contamination of groundwater, if it occurs, is most likely to be caused by leakage through the vertical borehole. Contamination of groundwater from the underground hydraulic fracturing process itself (i.e. the fracturing of the shale) is unlikely. However, surface spills of hydraulic fracturing fluids or wastewater may affect groundwater, and emissions to air also have the potential to impact on health. Where potential risks have been identified in the literature, the reported problems are typically a result of operational failure and a poor regulatory environment.\\" A 2012 report prepared for the European Union Directorate-General for the Environment identified potential risks to humans from air pollution and ground water contamination posed by hydraulic fracturing. This led to a series of recommendations in 2014 to mitigate these concerns. A 2012 guidance for pediatric nurses in the US said that hydraulic fracturing had a potential negative impact on public health and that pediatric nurses should be prepared to gather information on such topics so as to advocate for improved community health. A 2017 study in The American Economic Review found that \\"additional well pads drilled within 1 kilometer of a community water system intake increases shale gas-related contaminants in drinking water.\\" Statistics collected by the U.S. Department of Labor and analyzed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a correlation between drilling activity and the number of occupational injuries related to drilling and motor vehicle accidents, explosions, falls, and fires. Extraction workers are also at risk for developing pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer and silicosis (the latter because of exposure to silica dust generated from rock drilling and the handling of sand). The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) identified exposure to airborne silica as a health hazard to workers conducting some hydraulic fracturing operations. NIOSH and OSHA issued a joint hazard alert on this topic in June 2012. Additionally, the extraction workforce is at increased risk for radiation exposure. Fracking activities often require drilling into rock that contains naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), such as radon, thorium, and uranium. Another report done by the Canadian Medical Journal reported that after researching they identified 55 factors that may cause cancer, including 20 that have been shown to increase the risk of leukemia and lymphoma. The Yale Public Health analysis warns that millions of people living within a mile of fracking wells may have been exposed to these chemicals. Environmental impacts Clean Energy March in Philadelphia September 2019 climate strike in Alice Springs, Australia The potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing include air emissions and climate change, high water consumption, groundwater contamination, land use, risk of earthquakes, noise pollution, and health effects on humans.Tatomir, A., McDermott, C., Bensabat, J., Class, H., Edlmann, K., Taherdangkoo, R., & Sauter, M. (2018) https://www.adv-geosci.net/45/185/2018/. Conceptual model development using a generic Features, Events, and Processes (FEP) database for assessing the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater aquifers, Advances in Geosciences, v.45, p185-192. Air emissions are primarily methane that escapes from wells, along with industrial emissions from equipment used in the extraction process. Modern UK and EU regulation requires zero emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Escape of methane is a bigger problem in older wells than in ones built under more recent EU legislation. Hydraulic fracturing uses between of water per well, with large projects using up to . Additional water is used when wells are refractured. An average well requires of water over its lifetime. According to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, greater volumes of fracturing fluids are required in Europe, where the shale depths average 1.5 times greater than in the U.S. Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits, and ground water can be contaminated if the fluid is able to escape the formation being fractured (through, for example, abandoned wells, fractures, and faults) or by produced water (the returning fluids, which also contain dissolved constituents such as minerals and brine waters). The possibility of groundwater contamination from brine and fracturing fluid leakage through old abandoned wells is low. Produced water is managed by underground injection, municipal and commercial wastewater treatment and discharge, self-contained systems at well sites or fields, and recycling to fracture future wells. Typically less than half of the produced water used to fracture the formation is recovered. About of land is needed per each drill pad for surface installations. Well pad and supporting structure construction significantly fragments landscapes which likely has negative effects on wildlife. These sites need to be remediated after wells are exhausted. Research indicates that effects on ecosystem services costs (i.e. those processes that the natural world provides to humanity)has reached over $250 million per year in the U.S. Each well pad (in average 10 wells per pad) needs during preparatory and hydraulic fracturing process about 800 to 2,500 days of noisy activity, which affect both residents and local wildlife. In addition, noise is created by continuous truck traffic (sand, etc.) needed in hydraulic fracturing. Research is underway to determine if human health has been affected by air and water pollution, and rigorous following of safety procedures and regulation is required to avoid harm and to manage the risk of accidents that could cause harm. In July 2013, the US Federal Railroad Administration listed oil contamination by hydraulic fracturing chemicals as \\"a possible cause\\" of corrosion in oil tank cars.Frederick J. Herrmann, Federal Railroad Administration, letter to American Petroleum Institute, 17 July 2013, p.4. Hydraulic fracturing has been sometimes linked to induced seismicity or earthquakes. The magnitude of these events is usually too small to be detected at the surface, although tremors attributed to fluid injection into disposal wells have been large enough to have often been felt by people, and to have caused property damage and possibly injuries. A U.S. Geological Survey reported that up to 7.9 million people in several states have a similar earthquake risk to that of California with hydraulic fracturing and similar practices being a prime contributing factor. Microseismic events are often used to map the horizontal and vertical extent of the fracturing. A better understanding of the geology of the area being fracked and used for injection wells can be helpful in mitigating the potential for significant seismic events.Managing the seismic risk posed by wastewater disposal, Earth Magazine, 57:38–43 (2012), M. D. Zoback. Retrieved 31 December 2014. People obtain drinking water from either surface water, which includes rivers and reservoirs, or groundwater aquifers, accessed by public or private wells. There are already a host of documented instances in which nearby groundwater has been contaminated by fracking activities, requiring residents with private wells to obtain outside sources of water for drinking and everyday use.Roberts JS Testimony of J.Scott Roberts, Deputy Secretary for Mineral Resources Management, Department of Environmental Protection (Pennsylvania) 20 May 2010. Despite these health concerns and efforts to institute a moratorium on fracking until its environmental and health effects are better understood, the United States continues to rely heavily on fossil fuel energy. In 2017, 37% of annual U.S. energy consumption is derived from petroleum, 29% from natural gas, 14% from coal, and 9% from nuclear sources, with only 11% supplied by renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.  Regulations  Countries using or considering use of hydraulic fracturing have implemented different regulations, including developing federal and regional legislation, and local zoning limitations. In 2011, after public pressure France became the first nation to ban hydraulic fracturing, based on the precautionary principle as well as the principle of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards. The ban was upheld by an October 2013 ruling of the Constitutional Council. Some other countries such as Scotland have placed a temporary moratorium on the practice due to public health concerns and strong public opposition. Countries like England and South Africa have lifted their bans, choosing to focus on regulation instead of outright prohibition. Germany has announced draft regulations that would allow using hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the exception of wetland areas. In China, regulation on shale gas still faces hurdles, as it has complex interrelations with other regulatory regimes, especially trade. Many states in Australia have either permanently or temporarily banned fracturing for hydrocarbons. In 2019, hydraulic fracturing was banned in UK. The European Union has adopted a recommendation for minimum principles for using high- volume hydraulic fracturing. Its regulatory regime requires full disclosure of all additives. In the United States, the Ground Water Protection Council launched FracFocus.org, an online voluntary disclosure database for hydraulic fracturing fluids funded by oil and gas trade groups and the U.S. Department of Energy. Hydraulic fracturing is excluded from the Safe Drinking Water Act's underground injection control's regulation, except when diesel fuel is used. The EPA assures surveillance of the issuance of drilling permits when diesel fuel is employed., Environmental Protection Agency In 2012, Vermont became the first state in the United States to ban hydraulic fracturing. On 17 December 2014, New York became the second state to issue a complete ban on any hydraulic fracturing due to potential risks to human health and the environment.

He played Minor counties cricket for Suffolk from 1981 to 1990, making 64 Minor Counties Championship and 8 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances. He made his first List A appearance for Suffolk against Derbyshire in the 1981 NatWest Trophy. He made 5 further List A appearances for the county, the last of which came against Northamptonshire in the 1989 NatWest Trophy. In his 6 List A matches for Suffolk, he took 5 wickets at an average of 22.00, with best figures of 2/14. With the bat, he scored 40 runs at an average of 10.00, with a high score of 26 not out. He retired at the end of the 1990 season.

The UK Albums Chart is a weekly record chart based on album sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom. Albums are defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as being a type of music release that features more than four tracks and lasts longer than 25 minutes. During the 1970s, sales of albums in the United Kingdom were compiled on behalf of the British music industry by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB). Panel sales from approximately 250 (later expanded to 450) representative record stores across the UK were collected each week, and a multiplier figure would then be applied to these panel sales figures to obtain an estimate of the total sales across the country and to compile the weekly chart. Each week's number one was first revealed at 12.45 pm on Thursdays on the lunchtime show on BBC Radio 1, and then moved to 6:05 pm (later 6:30 pm) on Wednesday evenings during the Peter Powell and Bruno Brookes shows. The official charts of the best-selling singles and albums of the 1970s were compiled by BMRB and published in Music Week in the issue dated 22 December 1979, and the top 100 singles and albums were counted down throughout the day on Radio 1 on 31 December 1979, playing one track from each of the top 100 albums. As the charts had to be compiled before the end of the year, the cut-off date for collection of sales data was 8 December 1979. The biggest-selling album of the 1970s in the UK was Bridge over Troubled Water by American duo Simon & Garfunkel. Released on 6 February 1970, it spent a total of 33 weeks at number one, and was the best-selling album of both 1970 and 1971. Originally it was credited with 41 weeks at number one, but this figure includes eight weeks in February and March 1971 when no charts were published due to a postal strike which prevented collection of sales data, and the chart of 30 January 1971 was reused during this period. In 2006 the OCC decided that the rival Melody Maker album chart would replace the missing weeks, with George Harrison's All Things Must Pass at number one during that period. Although it was not an immediate big seller at the time and therefore does not appear in this list, Bat Out of Hell by Meat Loaf has since gone on to become one of the UK's best-selling albums. Released in the UK in February 1978, the album has only ever spent four weeks in the top ten of the album chart, two of them in 1981 in the wake of Meat Loaf's follow-up album Dead Ringer, and the other two in 2013 following Bat Out of Hells repackaging and re-release along with the Hits Out of Hell DVD. On both occasions the album peaked at number nine. However, Bat Out of Hell sold consistently for several years following its release, and has spent more than 500 weeks on the UK album chart, a total that, for a studio album, is bettered only by Fleetwood Mac's Rumours. As of February 2014 Bat Out of Hell is the 19th best-selling album of all time in the UK, and the third best- selling album released during the 1970s, behind Rumours and The Dark Side of the Moon and ahead of Bridge Over Troubled Water in fourth place. BMRB's methodology and data collection system have been criticised by other chart statisticians. However, while other chart compilers have produced their own versions of the equivalent 1970s singles chart, BMRB's list remains the only chart of the best-selling albums of the 1970s.

The song's chorus has a lyric inspired by a line from the Pixies song \\"Bone Machine\\". Bone Machine features the line 'You're so pretty when you're faithful to me', while Gavin Rossdale sings 'So pretty when you're faithful'. It was mutual appreciation of the Pixies that drew founding members Gavin Rossdale and Nigel Pulsford together. The song bears some resemblance to previous Bush hits \\"Glycerine\\" and \\"Letting the Cables Sleep\\" in that it is more subdued than the band's other singles. However, it is the only Bush song to feature an acoustic guitar.http://onesecondbush.com/bush/music/lyrics/golden-state/inflatable/ The song is the last single featuring the four original members of the band and it would be the last single to be released under the Bush name for almost 9 years until 2010 when \\"Afterlife\\" was released. The song was featured in the TV series 7th Heaven and Smallville.  Promotion  Rossdale and new guitarist Chris Traynor performed the song acoustically on the short-lived show Late World with Zach in 2002. Music video Inflatable was the last Bush song prior to their 2010 \\"The Sea of Memories\\" to feature a music video and was directed by Giuseppe Capotondi. Guitarist Pulsford was absent from the video as he had left the band a month before. Rossdale's initial vision was for the video to be set at a wedding ceremony for a young conscript about to leave for the Vietnam war. However, Rossdale was concerned that he would be seen as capitalising on his own impending wedding to Gwen Stefani and so instead the video was set at a leaving party. The band can be seen performing on stage while people dance. Later a brawl outbreaks but the band continue to perform undisturbed in a tranquil manner in fitting with the mood of the song. The video was filmed in London at the Lambeth Liberal & Radical club. The video featured the famous Russian couple and actors Zhanna and Sergei.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 9 December 1960. The following is a list of characters that first appeared in 1970, by order of first appearance. Anita Reynolds Anita Reynolds, played by Elisabeth Sladen, made her first screen appearance on 5 January 1970. Coronation Street marked Sladen's second television appearance, after previously taking a minor part in an episode of ITV Playhouse. Sladen's character became a love interest for established character Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), \\"even though the firebrand builder had gone to school with her father.\\" In 2009, Sladen recalled \\"In Corrie, I played Anita Reynolds, Len Fairclough's new girlfriend, and I was in it for five or six episodes.\\" Anita worked at the Flying Horse pub. When Annie Walker (Doris Speed), landlady of the Rovers Return, alienates her customers, the Flying Horse briefly becomes the first choice for the Rovers regulars, including Len Fairclough. Even though Len was nearly twenty years older than Anita, they put aside the age gap as they both like each other. Anita refuses to answer questions about the relationship from customers and even warns Maggie Clegg (Irene Sutcliffe) away from Len. Anita and Len go on a double date with Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and Alan Howard (Alan Browning). Anita talks with Elsie and impresses her. Anita asks Len to meet her parents, but Len begins to worry about the age gap and believes meeting Anita's parents would only increase his fears. Anita accepts Len's marriage proposal, but he gets cold feet and admits to Anita that he has doubts about their relationship. Len suggests they have a long engagement, but Anita makes it clear that she wants to get married and breaks up with him. Frank Bradley Frank Bradley, played by Tommy Boyle, made his first screen appearance on 8 July 1970.Little 2000, p.71. Frank and his friend Jud Johnson turned up looking for Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) and, after swearing that they were reformed characters, talked Ray into giving them a job. Ray employed Frank and Jud to build a display cabinet for Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) shop, but they stole a camera and threatened to pin the blame on Ray, unless he helped them with a robbery. Ken Barlow (William Roache) scared Frank and Jed off by posing as a policeman. A newly returned Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) was not put off by Frank's past and embarked on a \\"passionate affair\\" with him. At nineteen, Frank was almost half Bet's age and she was worried that he would leave her. Bet tried to get Frank to commit to her, but he felt trapped and broke off the relationship. Tony Parsons Tony Parsons was a young boy who received harmonium lessons from Ena Sharples in 1970. Although Tony had broken into the Victoria Street Mission on 5 August 1970, Ena wanted to nurture his talent and as she was an experienced player she took Tony under her wing and got him a scholarship at a music college. In February 1971, Tony gave his first public performance at the college and Ena was in attendance, along with Tony's mother Mrs Parsons. Mrs Parsons Mrs Parsons, played by June Brown, made her first screen appearance on 19 August 1970. Brown appeared as Mrs Parsons for three episodes. In 1985, she joined newly launched soap opera EastEnders as Dot Cotton. Dot stated that she was a fan of Coronation Street in 2010, to mark the serial's 50th anniversary. Mrs Parsons was the mother of Tony Parsons (David Hill), a young boy who received harmonium lessons from Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) in 1970. Ena was keen that Tony's talent be encouraged and was delighted to meet Mrs Parsons so they could talk about her son. The following year, Mrs Parsons and Ena went to Tony's first public concert at his music college, where Ena had got him a scholarship the year before. Mark Howard Mark Howard was Alan Howard's son from his first marriage to Laura. Tall, blonde and self-assured, he arrived without any announcement at Number 11 one night in October 1970 to the amazement of stepmother Elsie, who was totally unaware he existed in the first place. Mark was 18 years old and studying textile technology at college for three years. He had chosen that over civil engineering to be near his dad, keen to rebuild their relationship which had been fractured after his divorce from his mother, who had refused to allow father and son to see each other. Elsie and Mark were studiously polite to each other – her thoughts were preoccupied with the fact that Alan had been keeping secrets from her while he seemed to find it difficult to warm to the woman who had supplanted his mother in Alan's affections. Nevertheless, she agreed to Mark staying with them while he found digs, while letting rip at Alan for not being truthful with her. Mark quickly settled into No.11 but all the time there was an edge to his relationship with Elsie, not helped by him telling her how much Alan had loved Laura. Elsie was not fooled and sensed that Mark was making a hopeless attempt to reconcile his parents though Alan assured her that there was no chance of that happening. Mark made a good impression in the Rovers where Annie Walker concluded that he was a nice young man and looked on favourably when he chatted up her ward Lucille Hewitt. For her part, although she was interested in him, in the main Lucille agreed to go out with him to spite Ray Langton who she still held a candle for. The date was initially a success with Lucille being charmed by his manners though as the night wore on he upset her with his crude jokes and she confided in a worried Elsie that she thought he had a dark side to his character, going so far as to describe him as \\"dangerous\\". When pushed, she admitted to Elsie that Mark had asked Lucille for sex on their first date, using offensive language to do so. That same night, Mark revealed his true colours: he and Alan made arrangements to go to a football match but Mark had cottoned on to the fact that Elsie and Len Fairclough were old friends. He cried off the match at the last minute and quietly entered No.11, knowing that Len was visiting Elsie. Stood in the hallway, he listened at the closed doorway to the back room as Len and Elsie chatted, swapping their old suggestive banter between one another. Mark eagerly reported the conversation back to his father, putting on a front of being shocked at what he had heard. Alan asked Elsie what was going on and, in turn, she confronted Mark who denied the conversation. He told her that all he wanted was for his father to be happy, but told her obliquely that she wasn't the one to do that. She walked out on the two men and Alan, at last starting to see what was happening, told his son that he wouldn't let him come between him and his new wife and there was no way he was returning to Laura. Mark walked out on his father and Alan and Elsie were reconciled. Unwittingly, Mark came between the Howards again just over a year later when Laura decide to spend Christmas 1971 in the Mediterranean. He invited Mark to stay with them and, predictably, Elsie went ballistic when she found out and the two spent the festive season apart. Mark's character didn't improve and when Alan saw Laura briefly in January 1972, she blamed him for their son's unstable nature and wayward ways.

Overview  YPI takes place in secondary schools in North America and the UK as part of a mandatory course, so that each student across the entire grade level/year is able to participate. Students begin their YPI experience by taking part in an introductory workshop, forming teams, and working together to identify the social issues that are prevalent in their own community. Once they have identified these social issues, students select one issue as their focus, and search for local grassroots charities that exist in their community to assist vulnerable members of the local population. Student teams select the charity they believe best addresses their chosen issue, and begin preliminary research around the charity, its mandate and its activities. Teams contact and visit their chosen charity, conducting interviews to help gain a greater understanding of what the charity does, how it operates, the impact it has and challenges it faces, and how it can be supported by young people and the larger community. Students then go on to develop a presentation that will advocate on behalf of their charity and demonstrate the impact a grant to that charity would have on the community. The presentations are delivered in the classroom, and finalists are chosen to go on to deliver their presentation to a larger audience and a panel of judges as part of the YPI Final Presentation Assembly. Here, the judging panel will select one winning group to receive a $5,000 (£3,000) grant for their chosen charity. Through YPI, charities receive important funding from the youth of their community, and students - acting as young philanthropists - become powerful agents of social change. YPI is currently run in 370 schools to over 50,000 students annually in North America and the UK. Grants delivered through YPI total over $11,000,000 CDN as of November 2014.  History  YPI was developed by the Toskan Casale Foundation (founded in 2001 by Frank Toskan, Victor Casale, and Julie Toskan-Casale), a family foundation situated in Toronto, Canada, that is dedicated to supporting and strengthening local, community-based social service agencies. YPI was first piloted in 2002, at Royal St. George's College, in Toronto. In 2003, YPI took place in 29 schools across Ontario. By 2005, YPI was being run in British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec. In partnership with the Institute for Philanthropy, YPI International was launched in 2006 and piloted in London, England. The following year YPI was in 10 schools across England. YPI launched in Scotland in 2008 with the support of Sir Ian Wood and The Wood Foundation. In 2009, the Initiative launched in New York City, and through 2010 and 2011 began to be run in Atlantic Canada and Northern Ireland. In 2010, YPI was presented with the Best Practice Award in Civic Education by the Institute for Canadian Citizenship. In 2011, YPI's president Julie Toskan-Casale was honoured with the first-ever Premier's Award for Philanthropy in Education. In 2012, YPI celebrated over one million pounds donated to UK charities throughout England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, since 2006. YPI celebrated its 10th anniversary during the 2012-2013 academic year In 2014, YPI celebrated over ten million dollars donated internationally to community- based, social service charities.  YPI Canada  YPI is currently run in 158 schools across Canada, with an estimated 26,000 students participating. The École des Sentiers, at Quebec City is the only francophone school to participated. A total of $7,375,000 has been granted to Canadian charities through YPI. In the 2012-13 academic year, 4,225 Canadian charities were advocated for through YPI, and an estimated 61,000 people will directly benefit from YPI grants to charities. YPI students reached an estimated 182,000 Canadians with their presentations and information on their charities. YPI launched in Canada in 2002.  YPI Northern Ireland  YPI is currently run in schools across Northern Ireland with an estimated 2,250 students participating. YPI launched in Northern Ireland in 2011.

He served in the Chinese Imperial Maritime Custom Service from 1874 to 1908, but is best known for his scholarly publications after his retirement, most prominently The International Relations of the Chinese Empire, a three volume chronicle of the relations of the Qing dynasty with Western countries, and The Chronicles of the East India Company Trading to China, 1635–1834. Morse descended from New England stock although for five generations his family lived in Nova Scotia, where he was born. The family returned to Medford, Massachusetts when Morse was young. He attended Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard College in 1874, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He married Annie Josephine Welsford in London on February 8, 1881. The couple had no children of their own. After Morse's retirement, they lived in Surrey, England, and during World War I he became a British citizen. He was granted an honorary LL.D. from Western Reserve University in 1913 and an Honorary LL.D. from Harvard in his Fiftieth Reunion year, 1924. He died in on February 13, 1934 in Surrey, England. Maritime Customs Service In his senior year of college, Morse and three of his Harvard classmates were recruited to join the Imperial Maritime Custom Service under Sir Robert Hart, who had headed the Service since 1860. Morse was at first stationed in Shanghai, where he studied the northern dialect, Mandarin, for an hour each day before breakfast, and then served in Peking. His spoken Chinese became good enough for interpreting day-to-day business, but he could not read well enough to handle a wide variety of texts. He was posted to Tientsin in 1877, doing extra duty for the Northern Chinese Famine of that winter and the following summer. When posted to the London office of the Customs Service, he met Annie Josephine Welsford – \\"Nan\\" – who had been born in Brooklyn to British parents. They were married in 1881. While in London, Morse also joined the Royal Asiatic Society and met a number of the leading Orientalists of the time. On the couple's subsequent posting to Tientsin, Nan took an almost instant dislike to China and the Chinese, though it is not clear how this affected her husband's attitudes. Morse was involved under Li Hongzhang's direction, in the diplomacy surrounding the Sino-French War of 1885 for which he received the Order of the Double Dragon, third division, second class.John King Fairbank, Martha Henderson Coolidge and Richard J. Smith. H. B. Morse, Customs Commissioner and Historian of China. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1995. , 18–20, 26–27, 55. In the following years Morse helped to audit and supervise the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, a joint venture between Chinese officials and merchants. He worked with Sheng Xuanhuai, but ran into trouble negotiating the political currents. Upon his resignation from the company in 1877, he was reassigned to Shanghai, where he supervised the Statistical Department. In the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, he found himself one of some two hundred and fifty members, most of whom worked for the Customs Service, and soon became one of the most productive. He and Nan were sent to Pakhoi (Mandarin: Beihai), on the north coast of the Gulf of Tonkin, in 1889, and then on a two- year leave in the United States. Their next posting was to Tamsui in Taiwan, where he was an important witness to the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1895. He then served in Pakhoi once more, Youzhou, Hunan, and Hankow. Poor health forced him to take leave from 1900–1903, but he returned to the Customs Service to head the Statistical Service from 1904 to 1908. He retired from the Customs Service in 1908.Fairbank, H.B. Morse, 61–62, 69–92. Second career: Morse the scholar and his role in the study of China Upon his retirement in 1908, rather than return to New England, which his wife disliked almost as much as China, the couple took up residence in Surrey, England. In 1909 he turned down feelers from the American government to become Ambassador to China. During the First World War, he became a British citizen (as he had been born in a British colony). He traveled frequently to the United States, and kept up relations with his Harvard classmates, including Charles Franklin Thwing, president of Western Reserve University. A long-time smoker, he died of pneumonia in February, 1934. Morse published his first large work in 1908, the year of his retirement, The Trade and Administration of the Chinese Empire. The first volume of The International Relations of the Chinese Empire came out in 1910 (the third and last volume in 1918). Articles in magazines and journals included \\"A Short Lived Republic,\\" which recounted his resistance to the 1895 takeover of Taiwan by Japan and the attempt to establish an independent nation.The New China Review (March 1919), cited in Fairbank, H.B. Morse, His novel, In the Days of the Taipings drew on the material in Volume II of International Relations to portray the viewpoints of both foreigners and of the Taiping leaders who rebelled against the dynasty which Morse had served. His most ambitious project was the massive documentary study of the British East India Company based on records in London's India Office, Chronicles of the East India Company. He had first contemplated the study in 1919, and was able to carry it out only because the India Office allowed him to remove the record books and ledgers and work on them at home. He scrupulously summarized and edited some two hundred years of trade and commercial relations of the Company, giving historians a lasting documentary. Western study of China was changing, however. John K. Fairbank went to Morse for scholarly guidance in 1929 and considered himself a disciple. He wrote that although the older scholar lived through the decades of foreign imperialism and the collapse of the Qing empire, his historical work \\"avoids the obtrusive chauvinism of the Western treaty port community of that period.\\" He recalled that \\"to me, as to other beginners, he offered generous encouragement and wise counsel.\\"John King Fairbank, Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast: The Opening of the Treaty Ports, 1842–1854 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1953;Reprinted: 1964), dedication. Fairbank characterized The International Relations of the Chinese Empire as \\"the most comprehensive history of modern China\\" in its time, but added that it was \\"foreign-documented bluebook history,\\" that is, diplomatic history which described foreign wars and treaties – \\"what was done in and to China by foreigners.\\" He noted that in the 1930s, a new generation of China specialists (including himself) chose to explore and emphasize the Chinese part of the story and what he called \\"China's response to the West.\\"Quoted in Paul Cohen, Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past (New York, London:: Columbia University Press, 1984), p. 102. That is, the new focus was on China, not the West. Fairbank noted that Morse \\"records the criticisms.... but gives little indication of the more positive side of the Confucian tradition, including its effort to maintain the ideals of loyalty and public service, and its capacity for reform.\\" Morse, moreover, was isolated from Chinese colleagues because of his wife's strong dislike of them—by having few Chinese friends, he was \\"flying on one wing.\\" Morse had neither the documents from the Chinese archives nor the conceptual tools of later scholars. Although he supplied chapter and verse for foreign aggression in China, \\"imperialism\\" was not mentioned as such.Fairbank, H.B. Morse, 222–223, 226. Nevertheless, even today there is still no other English language survey of China's diplomatic relations in the nineteenth century. International Relations was a sourcebook basic to such Marxist surveys as Hu Sheng's Imperialism and Chinese Politics (1952) and a Chinese translation was published in Beijing in 1957. The recent opening of archives in China has made available Maritime Commission documents which are not available outside that country, and Morse's contributions will be further revised. Morse's knowledge of Chinese money (from hands-on experience in the Customs) was excellent, and his works on Chinese money and Chinese numismatics remain essential references. Morse's personal collection of Chinese coins was acquired by the British Museum in the 1880s.Helen Wang, \\"A Short History of Chinese Numismatics in European Languages\\", in Early China Vol.35, Jan 2013, pp 403-437.

Loose House is a historic house located in Provo, Utah, United States. The house was individually nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 but was not listed due to owner objection. It later was included as a contributing property in the Provo East Central Historic District. Description Built in 1893 by Charles E. Loose, the Charles E. Loose House (383 E 200 S) \\"Combines the massing of the Shingle Style with a consistent program of Eastlake ornamentation. Its enveloping roof, veranda and pentagonal fanlight gable windows mark its individuality among the city's architectural sites (Historic Provo p. 24).\\" The Charles E. Loose House was designated a historic Provo City Landmark on April 28, 1995. The Victorian Mansions of Provo Built between the years 1893 and 1908 in Prov, this group of Victorian mansions are historically significant and represent not only fine architecture but some of the most successful men of the city and state at the time. These mansions include the Charles E. Loose House, the William H. Ray House, the Knight-Allen House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Mangum House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. All of these homes derive from the high style: Eastlake, Shingle, Craftsman, Italianate, Classical, Moorish, Colonial, and Romanesque Revival. Made primarily of brick, these homes exhibit the finest architecture and most ornate detailing to be found in the city of Provo. Charles E. Loose Charles E. Loose (1853–1929) was a banker and a Utah State Senator. Charles was linked to Provo as a central entrepreneur during the period of time when Provo's economy transformed from primarily agrarian to that of commercial mining. Charles E. Loose was a non-Mormon, as opposed to many of the other primary entrepreneurs made wealthy by the Tintic Mining District, and probably the most prominent in Provo at the turn of the century. As Grand Central stock rose, so did Charles Loose. By 1900 the company had installed a new surface plant, including an innovative all steel headframe over its shaft—a first and only in the entire area. Thus, Loose built his Provo residence in 1893. Jesse Knight and The Tintic Mining Industry The successful commercial mining of precious metals and minerals transformed Utah's economy from basically an agrarian base to a more industrialized state. Within this development the Tintic Mining District, located approximately southwest of Provo, was founded in 1869 and by 1899 became the leading mining center in Utah with a value of output placed at five million dollars. A central figure in Tintic success was Jesse Knight and the Knight family who resided in Provo. Jesse Knight attained wealth with his Humbug mine in the mid-1890s. The large silver producer allowed Knight to develop other mines in the East Tintic area. Knightsville grew around the workings and became touted as the only saloon-free, prostitute-free, privately owned mining camp in the United States. His strict adherence to doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made the town one inhabited primarily by Latter-day Saints. Jessie Knight was able to expand farther than the tintic mines, reaching to the power plant in Santaquin, the Tintic drain tunnel project, the Knight Dry farm, and the smelters at Silver City. The Bonneville Mining company, the Knight Woolen Mills, Ellison Ranching Company, The American- Columbian Corporation, The Springville-Mapleton Sugar Company, The Spring Canyon Coal Company, Utah Savings Bank, The Layton Sugar Company, and the Tintic Drain Tunnel Company all represent facets of the Knight Investment Company. The success resulting from the Tintic Mining District provided the means for Charles E. Loose to acquire the wealth evident from his residence. In fact, Loose was involved in the Grand Central mining Company as a manager. Preservation The house was nominated on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as part of a multiple property submission that nominated seven and listed six Provo houses. The listed houses are the Knight- Mangum House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight- Allen House, the William H. Ray House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. This house, the Charles E. Loose House, was determined to be eligible for the National Register, but it was not listed due to an objection by the owner.

Purpose  Compared to other sources of illumination, such as fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, LEDs are energy efficient and increasingly inexpensive. As hard-point light sources, however, LEDs have several significant limitations in edge-lit digital displays. First, the light generated by LEDs must be spread evenly to all parts of the display by a light guide (typically a plate of poly(methyl methacrylate)), which transports light by total internal reflection (TIR). Extraction patterns on the surface of the light-guide meter out the light and generate a uniform brightness distribution. Even with a light guide, dark zones can be noticeable along the injection edge closest to the LEDs. The existence of these dark zones requires that the injection edge be shielded by a border or bezel. The necessity of incorporating a bezel limits design options and the space available for displaying information. Dark zones also influence the spacing between LEDs, which is typically between about 9 mm and 11 mm; placing LEDS farther apart creates more pronounced dark zones. This, in turn, limits the ability of designers to reduce the number of LEDs in a display despite the cost advantages and increased energy efficiency of such a reduction. Furthermore, the poor light-mixing of current light guides makes digital displays highly sensitive to variations in LED color and brightness. Closely packed LEDs can also create thermal management issues. The first microstructured light-mixing tape was scheduled to be introduced in late 2011. 3M™ Uniformity Tape is designed to be applied directly to the injection edge of a light guide for the purpose of defusing the light generated by LEDs. The microstructure consists of linear aspheric prisms (Figure 1) that are aligned perpendicular to the plane of the guide. The size of the microstructure is small compared to the size of the LEDs, typically on the order of 12-50 μm. As a result, no registration of the tape with the LEDs is required. Figure 1. Schematic of Tape on Light Guide and Tape Microstructure File:Uniformity tape-Wiki-fig1.tif  Benefits  Microstructured Uniformity Tape greatly reduces dark zones by inducing lateral light-spreading in the plane of the light guide. The effect of the 3M Uniformity Tape on the injection of LED light from a nominally lambertian LED is shown in Figure 2a-c. The left image in Figure 2a shows the injection cone angle of the LED into a light guide under normal TIR conditions (+/-42 degrees in a conventional PMMA light guide with an optically flat entrance face). The right image shows a close-up view of the left image. Figures 2b and 2c (and their details on the right) show the effects of two variations of 3M Uniformity Tape, with refractive index equal to 1.54 and 1.62, respectively. Figure 2. Demonstration of the Light Spreading Enabled by Uniformity Tape File:Uniformity tape-Wiki-fig2.tif Research conducted by 3M indicates that the tape enables a 50 percent reduction in LED count. Additional redesign of the light guide's extraction pattern could lead to an LED reduction approaching two-thirds of current levels. The tape also opens opportunities for digital displays with lower cost, higher performance and new design flexibility, including the development of a robust backlight that will retain a uniform brightness despite multiple LED failures. These benefits can be achieved with little effect on overall system efficiency. Injection losses can be as low as 1-2 percent with a properly designed light guide. Application of Uniformity Tape also appears to provide ancillary benefits. When applied to the input edge of the light guide, the optically clear adhesive will wet out and conform to the surface roughness of the light guide edge so that the film and light guide were optically coupled (i.e., no air is trapped between them). As a result of this optical coupling, the PMMA plate does not require the level of polishing required in a conventional light guide; this suggests that Uniformity Tape could lead to a reduction in manufacturing steps and lower costs.

Allen Home is a historic house located at 135 E. 200 North in Provo, Utah. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Description  According to its 1978 NRHP nomination, the home \\"is a good example of the architectural transition from the Queen Anne style to turn-of- the-century revival styles, which emphasized symmetry and classical detailing.\\" Except for wide, curved horizontal and vertical brackets, the porch is classically detailed. This is one of the tallest and largest historic houses in Provo, and its two-story carriage may be the single largest building of its type. The heavy landscaping somewhat obscures the building's massiveness. The single-family dwelling has four major projections, each gabled, extending from the rusticated stone lintels, ornamental porch and bargeboards, polychrome color scheme, and combination of square and slanted bay wings. In good condition and relatively unaltered, the house is architecturally significant, as is the monitor-form carriage house, the lower level bays of which has been filled with windows.  The Victorian Mansions of Provo  Built between the years 1893 and 1908 in Provo, Utah, this group of Victorian mansions are historically significant and represent not only fine architecture but some of the most successful men of the city and state at the time. These mansions include the Charles E. Loose House, the William H. Ray House, the Knight-Allen House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Mangum House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. All of these homes derive from the high style: Eastlake, Shingle, Craftsman, Italianate, Classical, Moorish, Colonial, and Romanesque Revivals. Made primarily of brick, these homes exhibit the finest architecture and most ornate detailing to be found in the city of Provo.  History  Dr. Samuel H. Allen relocated to Provo in 1892, and built his beautiful home using local workers and materials. For a few years, he also ran his medical office out of his home, but the office was moved to the Knight block after it was built. In 1903 Samuel R. Thurman bought the home from Allen. S. R. Thurman had previously been mayor to the city of Lehi prior to moving to Provo in 1882. In 1882, he was elected the youngest member of the Utah House of Representatives, a position to which he was privileged to return for several election years in a row. Thurman was also politically involved as a member of the Utah Constitutional Convention of 1882, and as a chairman of the committee which drafted the first part of the Provo People's Party in 1882. As national parties began to replace these local parties, Thurman, like many Mormons of that era, became a Democrat, as well as a judged on the Supreme Court of Utah. It was not long before Thurman sold the home to John W. Taylor. John Taylor settled his third wife, Nellie Eva Todd, in this home, while his second wife, Nettie, lived at 287 East 200 North. John W. Taylor, the son of the third president of the LDS Church John Taylor, operated four farms in the area for income. In 1915, Taylor was excommunicated from the church, and his financial situation forced him to sell the home. Taylor sold this house to Dr. David Westwood, who had become vice-president of the Provo General Hospital, Provo's first hospital. Westwood used part of the home as his office. Later, his son John T., a dentist, and his family also lived in the home and shared an office (65 E 2nd N) with him. During the 1940s, the house was left vacant when the Westwood's moved away. In 1952, Monroe and Shirley Paxman bought the home and have continued to live there since. The Samuel H. Allen House was designated a historic Provo City landmark on April 28, 1995. The house and the carriage house are listed as two contributing buildings in the NRHP nomination. and See also *History of the National Register of Historic Places *United States National Register of Historic Places listings  References  *Taylor, Samuel Woolley, Family Kingdom, SLC: Western Epics, Inc. 1974. *Polks City Directory of Provo, 1891. *Sanborn Maps 1890. *Shirley Paxman, Interview, November 7, 1977 *Journal History, LDS Church, LDS Church Archives  External links  *NRHP Listings in Provo Utah Category:Houses in Provo, Utah Category:Houses completed in 1897 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:Queen Anne architecture in Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Provo, Utah Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Utah Category:Historic district contributing properties in Utah ","title":"Dr. Samuel H.

Early life Born into a family of singers and writers, Baron was introduced to many musical genres by her family at an early age. Noting her singing talents, her parents brought their young child to auditions for musical theater productions in New York City. The singer joined Glee clubs at school and formed her own female singing groups at school. At the age of 11, she heard her first \\"Rock and Roll\\" song. This affected her taste in music and desire to emulate the style; it was the first time she heard a Rock group with a female lead singer. This was significant since she realized that she could be a lead singer. Recording career At the age of 15, her parents sent her for vocal coaching in Manhattan, N.Y. After a while her coach sent her to record a demonstration record in a sound studio near Broadway. Upon hearing her sing, the sound engineer contacted his friend who was a producer of a small record company in N.Y.C.; he was impressed by her voice and immediately signed her to a contract. The singer's mother co-signed the document since Baron was a fifteen-year-old minor at the time. Baron became one of the many girl group/girl sound singers of the early 1960s. Baron was not a member of a group; her producers would hire \\"pay for hire\\" backup groups for her recordings. This \\"sound\\" as it is referred to had much to do with Phil Spector, one of its major creators; Spector produced recordings of this genre prolifically. The groups were composed of young adult or teenage girls, each with a lead singer and any number of back up singers. At the time, the troubled label (a small N.Y.C. record company owned by Wally Zober) could not promote Baron's \\"I've Got A Feeling\\"/\\"Oh Yeah\\" 45 vinyl and so she eventually signed a contract with Jerry Goldstein producer of FGG productions, also located in Manhattan. \\"Where Did My Jimmy Go\\"/\\"Tra la la, I Love You\\" was the result (Diamond). Later life Baron left the music industry at the age of 19, choosing to enter higher education due to changes in the music industry of those days; she eventually received an advanced degree.

Hodge (October 5, 1941 – May 31, 2011) was a U.S. Virgin Islander politician and lawyer. Hodge served as the Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands for two terms from 1987 to 1995 under Governor Alexander Farrelly. The Virgin Islands Daily News called him a \\"towering figure in local politics,\\" referring to his political career, which spanned several decades. Biography Early life Derek Michael Hodge was born on October 5, 1941, on the island of Saint Croix to parents, Rexford Hodge and Enid Kettle Hodge. He had one brother - Winston Hodge. Hodge was a cousin of Sir Cuthbert Sebastian, the Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis. He was raised in the Crucian town of Frederiksted and attended elementary school on the island. Hodge attended high school at Colegio San Justo on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico, where he graduated as class valedictorian and acquired a fluency in Spanish. Hodge received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1963 from Michigan State University. As an undergrad at Michigan State, Hodge formed a steel band called the Bamboushay Steel Band consisting of himself, Ariel Melchior Jr. (the future publisher of the Virgin Islands Daily News) and his brother, Winston Hodge. Following his graduation from Michigan State in 1963, worked as a teacher at schools in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including Brooklyn College, Elena Christian Junior High School in Saint Croix and the College of the Virgin Islands. In 1966, Hodge competed as a center basketball player at the 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games in San Juan with the U.S. Virgin Islands basketball team. He earned a juris doctorate from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington D.C. in 1971. Political career Hodge moved back to Saint Croix in 1972 and joined his brother's law firm, Hodge, Sheen and Finch. He became active in local politics and was elected the St. Croix District Chairman of the Democratic Party in 1974. He remained a lifelong Democrat. In 1982, Hodge ran for Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands as a Democrat, but without the official endorsement of the Democratic Party. He lost the election. (Governor Juan Francisco Luis won re- election for a second term in a five-candidate gubernatorial race. Hodge then served as the president of the Virgin Islands Bar Association shortly before his election to the legislature in 1984. Hodge attempted a successful political comeback in 1984, when he was elected as a senator to the 16th Legislature of the Virgin Islands. He won the most votes in the senate race on Saint Croix. Hodge's colleagues in the legislature elected him President of the Virgin Islands Legislature during his freshman term in office, from 1985 to 1986. In 1986, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alexander Farrelly persuaded Hodge to leave the Senate and become his running mate for lieutenant governor in the election. Farrelly and Hodge defeated the Republican Julio Brady and won the election in November 1986. They were sworn in as governor and lieutenant governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 5, 1987. Both were re-elected to a second term in 1990, defeating former Virgin Islands Governor Juan Francisco Luis. Lt. Governor Hodge and former delegate Ron de Lugo collaborated to obtain $20 million in federal funding for Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on Saint Croix. According to Governor John de Jongh, Hodge also worked to restore a good bond rating for the U.S. Virgin Islands government, which allowed $230 million in bonds to become available for the Virgin Islands' Capital Improvement Program. Hodge is also remembered for lobbying for federal emergency funds to rebuild after Hurricane Hugo struck Saint Croix in 1989, devastating the island's buildings and infrastructure. Governor Farrelly was term limited in 1994 and could not seek a consecutive third term. Lt. Governor Derek Hodge announced his candidacy for governor in 1994 with the full endorsement of the Democratic Party and chose Alfred O. Heath as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Hodge was defeated in a special gubernatorial runoff election held on November 22, 1994, by the independent ticket of Roy Schneider, and his running mate, Kenneth Mapp. Hodge left office on January 2, 1995, when Schneider and Mapp were sworn in as governor and lieutenant governor. Later life Hodge and his cousin, Kathleen Mackay, opened a private law firm after he left office in 1995. In 2002, Hodge delivered the eulogy for former Governor Alexander Farrelly in Washington D.C. Derek Michael Hodge died of cancer on May 31, 2011, at the age of 69. He was survived by his first wife, Jessica Margaret Austin Hodge, his second wife, Beatrice Emmy Nieves Hodge, and the last wife, Monique Sibilly- Hodge; two children, Marisol Cohen and Jonathan Hodge; his sister, Coleen Hodge; and three grandchildren, Olivia, Malachi and Hadassah. He was preceded in death by his brother, Winston Anthony Benjamin Hodge, and his parents. Hodge was laid in state at Government House on Saint Thomas on June 8, followed by a memorial service held at the Episcopal Cathedral Church of All Saints in Charlotte Amalie. He was the flown to Christiansted, where he was laid in state on Saint Croix's Government House as well. Hodge's funeral was held at St. John's Episcopal Church in Christiansted on June 10, 2011. He was buried at Frederiksted Cemetery with honors provided by the Virgin Islands National Guard.

Symptoms include pain, swelling, and a decreased ability to move the knee. People are generally unable to walk. Complication may include injury to the artery or nerve, arthritis, and compartment syndrome. The cause is typically trauma such as a fall or motor vehicle collision. Risk factors include osteoporosis and certain sports such as skiing. Diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with X-rays and a CT scan. Some fractures may not be seen on plain X-rays. Pain may be managed with NSAIDs, opioids, and splinting. In those who are otherwise healthy, treatment is generally by surgery. Occasionally, if the bones are well aligned and the ligaments of the knee are intact, people may be treated without surgery. They represent about 1% of broken bones. They occur most commonly in middle aged males and older females. In the 1920s they were called a \\"fender fracture\\" due to their association with people being hit by a motor vehicle while walking.  Signs and symptoms  Tibial plateau fractures typically presents with knee effusion, swelling of the knee soft tissues and inability to bear weight. The knee may be deformed due to displacement and/or fragmentation of the tibia which leads to loss of its normal structural appearance. Blood in the soft tissues and knee joint (hemarthrosis) may lead to bruising and a doughy feel of the knee joint. Due to the tibial plateau's proximity to important vascular (i.e. arteries, veins) and neurological (i.e. nerves such as peroneal and tibial) structures, injuries to these may occur upon fracture. A careful examination of the neurovascular systems is imperative. A serious complication of tibial plateau fractures is compartment syndrome in which swelling causes compression of the nerves and blood vessels inside the leg and may ultimately lead to necrosis or cell death of the leg tissues.  Cause  Tibial plateau fractures may be divided into low energy or high energy fractures. Low energy fractures are commonly seen in older females due to osteoporotic bone changes and are typically depressed fractures. High energy fractures are commonly the result of motor vehicle accidents, falls or sports related injuries. These causes constitute the majority of tibial plateau fractures in young individuals.  Mechanism  Fractures of the tibial plateau are caused by a varus (inwardly angulating) or valgus (outwardly angulating) force combined with axial loading or weight bearing on knee. The classically described situation in which this occurs is from a car striking a pedestrian's fixed knee (\\"bumper fracture\\"). However most of these fractures occur from motor vehicle accidents or falls. Injury can be due to a fall from height in which knee forced into valgus or varus. The tibial condyle is crushed or split by the opposing femoral condyle, which remains intact. The knee anatomy provides insight into predicting why certain fracture patterns occur more often than others. The medial plateau is larger and significantly stronger than the lateral pleateau. Also, there is a natural valgus or outward angulation alignment to the limb which coupled with the often valgus or outwardly angulating force on impact will injure the lateral side. This explains how 60% of plateau fractures involve the lateral pleateau, 15% medial plateau, 25% bicondylar lesions. Partial or complete ligamentous ruptures occur in 15-45%, meniscal lesions in about 5-37% of all tibial plateau fractures.  Diagnosis  In all injuries to the tibial plateau radiographs (commonly called x-rays) are imperative. Computed tomography scans are not always necessary but are sometimes critical for evaluating degree of fracture and determining a treatment plan that would not be possible with plain radiographs. Magnetic Resonance images are the diagnositic modality of choice when meniscal, ligamentous and soft tissue injuries are suspected. CT angiography should be considered if there is alteration of the distal pulses or concern about arterial injury.

Multiple classifications of tibial plateau fractures have been developed. Currently, the Schatzker classification system is the most widely accepted and used. It is composed of six condyle fracture types classified by fracture pattern and fragment anatomy. Each increasing numeric fracture type denotes increasing severity. The severity correlates with the amount of energy imparted to the bone at the time of injury and prognosis. Schatzker classification for tibial plateau fracture: * Type I = Lateral Tibial plateau fracture without depression. This is a wedge-shaped pure cleavage fracture and involves a vertical split of the lateral tibial plateau. It is usually the result of a low energy injury in young individuals with normal mineralization. May be caused by a valgus force combined with axial loading that leads to the lateral femoral condyle being driven into the articular surface of the tibial plateau. Represent 6% of all tibial plateau fractures. * Type II = Lateral tibial plateau fracture with depression, This is a combined cleavage and compression fracture and involves vertical split of the lateral condyle combined with depression of the adjacent load bearing part of the condyle. Caused by a valgus force on the knee; it is a low energy injury, typically seen in individuals of the 4th decade or older with osteoporotic changes in bone. Most common, and make up 75% of all tibial plateau fractures. There is a 20% risk of distraction injuries to the medial collateral ligament. May include distraction injury to the medial collateral ligament or anterior cruciate ligament. * Type III: Focal depression of articular surface with no associated split. This is a pure compression fracture of the lateral or central tibial plateau in which the articular surface of the tibial plateau is depressed and driven into the lateral tibial mataphysis by axial forces.3 A low energy injury, these fractures are more frequent in the 4th and 5th decades of life and individuals with osteoporotic changes in bone. They are extremely rare. Can be further divided into two subtypes: IIIA Compression Fracture of the lateral tibial plateau IIIB Compression Fracture of the central tibial plateau May result in joint instability. * Type IV = Medial tibial plateau fracture, with or without depression; may involve tibial spines; associated soft tissue injuries. This is a medial tibial plateau fracture with a split or depressed component. It is usually the result of a high energy injury and involves a varus force with axial loading at the knee. Represent 10% of all tibial plateau fractures. There is high risk of damage to the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve and therefore carry a worse prognosis. May include distraction injuries to lateral collateral ligament, fibular dislocation/fracture, posterolateral corner. * Type V = Bicondylar tibial plateau fracture, Consists of a split fracture of the medial and lateral tibial plateau. It is usually the result of a high energy injury with complex varus and valgus forces acting upon the tibial plateau. May include injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament and collateral ligaments. Make up 3% of all tibial plateau fractures. * Type VI = Tibial plateau fracture with diaphyseal discontinuity Main feature of this type of fracture is a transverse subcondylar fracture with dissociation of the metaphysis from the diaphysis. The fracture pattern of the condyles is variable and all types of fractures can occur. This is a high energy injury with a complex mechanism that includes varus and valgus forces. Up to 33% of these fractures may be open, often with extensive soft tissue injuries and risk of compartment syndrome. Represents 20% of all tibial plateau fractures.  Treatment  Repair of a tibial plateau fracture Pain may be managed with NSAIDs, opioids, and splinting. In those who are otherwise healthy, treatment is generally by surgery. Occasionally, if the bones are well aligned and the ligaments of the knee are intact, people may be treated without surgery. The surgery usually involves reducing the fractured fragments of the tibia plateau to their anatomical position and fixing them in place with screws only or fixed angle anatomical plates ensuring absolute stability. Implant selection is based on the type of injury. Generally, simple or incomplete fractures (Schatzker type 1) of the plateau are compressed with 6.5mm partially threaded cancellous screws. Complex type fractures will require a plate for enhanced stability. As the tibia condyles articulate with the femur (thigh bone) to form knee joint, any incongruity in the articular surface is unacceptable as it leads to early arthritis. Prolonged immobilization of the knee joint is also not recommended which result in stiffness of the joint and difficult recovery.  Epidemiology  Tibial plateau fractures constitute 1% of all fractures. Peak age is 30–40 years old in men and 60-70 in women. Approximately half of the people who sustain a tibial plateau fracture are aged over 50 years old.

Life and work Gustav Reichardt was born in Schmarsow. He received his first music lessons at the age of five from his father, the versatile educated countryside preacher Rev. Georg Gustav Zacharias Reichardt (1766-1852). Already, at the age of nine, he appeared on violin and piano. From 1809 to 1811, he received music lessons in Neustrelitz and was a violinist in a local Chapel. In 1811 he attended grammar school and then he began studying theology at the University of Greifswald. In 1818 he moved to the Berlin Academy, but decided to study music in 1819. He became a pupil of Bernhard Klein in music theory and composition. As a member of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin (1819-1832) he co-founded the Berliner Liedertafel and soon attracted attention due to his well-trained bass voice. He turned entirely to composition and developed a fruitful activity in this area. After a number of years he acted as a singing teacher with extraordinary success. Due to this he began to have access to aristocratic circles and the royal family of Frederick William III of Prussia. As a popular teacher, he taught singing, including to the later Emperor Frederick III. For his wedding in 1858, he composed a cantata festival. In 1850 he was appointed royal music director. Reichardt's compositions number only thirty-six and they are mostly vocal popular songs, preferably for male choirs. Among them is the song The image of the Rose. Artists such as Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and music enthusiasts met regularly at his home. During a visit to the Sněžka in 1825, he set to music the poem Des Deutschen Vaterland by Ernst Moritz Arndt, thus becoming well known in Prussian Berlin circles. The song became one of the hymns of the German unification movement. In 1871 he published under Opus 36 his last work, a national anthem, with lyrics by Müller von der Werra. Reichardt died, aged 87, in Berlin. His final resting place is located after on the southwestern alley of Stahnsdorf cemetery. Literature *Hans Michael Schletterer: Reichardt, Gustav.

It is in 1999 when he makes history by conducting the first heart transplant surgery in Puerto Rico. On June 27, 1999, Dr.Iván González Cancel along with a group of healthcare professionals performed the surgery which took 3 hours and 17 minutes at the Cardiovascular Center of Puerto Rico. Among the group of physicians that participated in the successful surgery were: Dr. Héctor Banchs Pieretti, Dr. Cid Quintana, Dr. Rolando Colón, Dr. Héctor Delgado Osorio and Dr. Efraín Defendini.

Quintero's wife María Petra Rubio was born near 1741 and came from Álamos, Sonora. A person of Spanish descent. They bore five children María Gertrudis, María Concepcíon, María Tomasa, María Rafaela, and José Clemente. Luis Quintero and his wife María Petra Rubio, represent one of the eleven original couples to settle with their families at El Pueblo de Los Angeles in 1781. The Quintero family traveled from Sonora to Alta California to be one of the founding families of the new Spanish pueblo in 1781 being escorted along with other settlers and soldiers by Fernando Rivera y Moncada. When Captain Rivera assembled his crew of soldiers and settlers in Álamos in January 1781, Luis Quintero’s destiny was already tied to the historic expedition about to take place. On January 21, his 16-year-old daughter Catharina was married at Purísima Concepción Church in Álamos to one of Rivera’s soldiers, Joaquin Rodríquez. His 15-year-old daughter, Fabiana Sebastiana, was married to another soldier of the expedition, Eugenio Valdés, on the same day. And, on the following day, Luis’s eldest daughter, 18-year-old María Juana Josefa, was united in marriage with still another soldado de cuera, José Rosalino Fernández. The prospect of never seeing his daughters again may have played a role in Luis' decision to join the expedition, for it is believed that Luis Quintero was the last poblador to sign on the dotted line. When the settlers left Álamos on February 2, 1781, Luis, María Petra, and their eight children were among them. Very little is known about Luis Quintero’s activities in the first half year at the pueblo. But, on March 22 and 25, 1782, Luis served as padrino (godfather) for the Indians confirmed by Father Serra at the San Gabriel Mission. However, a day later, on March 26, 1782, Luis and two other settlers were expelled from Los Angeles by order of Governor de Neve and \\"sent away as useless to the pueblo and themselves.” Their properties confiscated by the authorities, Luis and his family joined the Santa Barbara Company on their journey to the northwest. In analyzing the causes of Luis Quintero’s expulsion from Los Angeles in 1782, the tailor Luis Quintero was probably not well suited for the rigors of frontier life. He was not a farmer and, at the age of 55, it was not likely that he could have adjusted effortlessly to the profession of farmer. Three of Luis’ daughters had married soldiers who were attached to the Expedition of 1781. All three of these soldiers (José Rosalino Fernández, Joaquin Rodríguez, and Eugenio Valdés) were destined to be stationed at the Santa Barbara Presidio in the Spring of 1782, and it is possible that the Quintero family hoped to be closer to those daughters. Whatever the case may be, it is known that Luis Quintero lived out the remaining 28 years of his life as a respectable member of the budding Santa Barbara community, serving as the maestro sastre (master tailor) for the soldiers at the presidio. Quintero died in 1810 in Santa Barbara, after serving as tailor for the soldiers at the presidio.

The Fortress of Arad is a fortification system built in the city of Arad, on the left bank of the Mureş River in the 18th century at the direct order of the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa. The fortress lies today in the Subcetate neighbourhood of the city, on the former military border between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The fortress has been used during its existence as a military garrison, a military prison and today it is the home of the Mixed Romanian-Hungarian Battalion since 1999. Building of the fortress Following the victories of the Holy League at the Battle of Vienna and the Habsburg victory at the second Battle of Mohács the city of Arad has been freed from Ottoman rule. After the Treaty of Karlowitz, the entire city of Arad was on the border region of the Habsburg Empire and so, of critical importance for the Viennese Court as it became a focal point of the Military Frontier administration until 1751. The strategic placement of the city determined Prince Eugene of Savoy, to rebuild and improve the former rectangular Turkish built fortress, on the right bank of the river, but after consultations with the Empress, the decision was made not to rebuild the old fortress, but to erect a new and vastly improved fortified complex on the peninsula lying just south of the city. The project was made after the plans of the Austrian general and architect Ferdinand Philipp von Harsch, having the form of a star with six corners, built with three rows of underground pillboxes and several trenches, which in the past could have been flooded. Construction lasted from 1763 to 1783, the building efforts were done with thousands of prisoners and with costs of 3 million Gulden. The main entrance gate and buildings inside the fortress were built in the Baroque style. Inside the fortress, there is a Catholic church, and in the surrounding church buildings were housed Franciscan friars, under the patronage of St. John of Capistrano. The last four monks lived in the fortress until 1861. Today the church and adjacent buildings are more or less in a derelict state. History After its completion, the fortress was a part of the inner system of fortifications that protected the outer regions of the empire, for possible conflicts in the area, as with the Oradea and Timișoara fortifications. Starting from 1794, the fortress has been used as a military prison when 1200 French soldiers were imprisoned. During the 1848–1849 Revolution, the fortress played a key role as it was besieged by the Hungarian Republican army for nine months until it was finally occupied in June 1849. After only 46 days, the Habsburg army moved back into the fortress and used it partly as a military prison for more than 500 officers. Most of the prisoners were sentenced to death. Among them were the 13 Generals of the Republican Army that were executed on October 6, outside the outer east walls of the fortress, and today are considered martyrs. In 1852 Emperor Franz Joseph I visited the fort and ordered some pardons. One of the most important prisoner who was imprisoned in the fortress, was the Romanian revolutionary Eftimie Murgu. During the First World War, thousands of Serb soldiers and civilians from Bosnia-Herzegovina were placed in detention here in an improvised camp outside the fort. Out of the entire number of persons imprisoned here 4317 died as a result of typhus and maltreatment. They were buried in several mass graves in the cemetery Pomenirea. A plaque has been placed at the entrance of the fortress in their honor. The most famous prisoner in the fortress of Arad was undoubtedly Gavrilo Princip, who on 28 June 1914 killed the heir to the throne of Austria- Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, in Sarajevo, which led to the outbreak of World War I. About the inhuman conditions in which prisoners were held in the fortress of Arad warned Ştefan Cicio Pop, deputy of the Romanian National Party in an interpellation to the Hungarian parliament in Budapest during 1917. After the first World War, the fortress was occupied by allied Serbian and French troops under French command, until July 1919 when it was handed over to the Romanian Army. In the interwar period, the fortress was a garrison of the 93 Infantry Regiment of the 1st Romanian Infantry Division. After the armistice between Romania and the Soviet Union, in September 12, 1944 the city and Arad Garrison was occupied by the Soviet Red Army. The city garrison remained a Soviet tank unit until 1958 when the Red Army retreated leaving way to the Romanian Army. Currently the fortress is hosting a mixed Romanian-Hungarian joint peacekeeping battalion, operational since 1999.

Lithography by (1822-1873) of the New Royal Palace in Tilburg in 1849. In the drawing there's a mistake. The artist drew in the façade of the palace only six of the original eight windows on both sides of the entrance adjoining series of windows. The City Hall of Tilburg or Palace-Council House (Dutch: Paleis- Raadhuis) is a former royal palace and presently a part of Tilburg city hall in the Netherlands. Construction of the palace was commissioned by King William II of the Netherlands, who placed the cornerstone on 13 August 1847. The king wanted to have a country residence in Tilburg. He never lived in the palace as he died on 17 March 1849, just 22 days before completion of the palace. The palace was built by contractor and carpenter from Tilburg. On 7 July 1847 Goijaerts accepted the commission from William II of the Netherlands for the sum of ƒ 57,000. Goijaerts completed the palace on 7 April 1849. The palace has been rebuilt thoroughly twice, in 1865 and from 1934 to 1936, to give the palace a different purpose. The palace has been used as a school and as city hall of the municipality Tilburg. The school offered secular tuition on high school level. Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was the school’s most famous student. In 1931 the palace was donated to Tilburg municipality by the Dutch royal family. During World War II the palace was used as an observation post for detecting allied aeroplanes. The palace lost its main function in 1971 when a much larger and more modern building was completed. This building is connected to the palace through a sky bridge at the north side of the palace. Since then the Palace is mostly used as a location for wedding ceremonies, lectures, oath-takings and symposia.  Construction   Location  The new royal palace was built in the backyard of a former royal residence. This former residence was actually a connected row of houses. In 1835 The Prince of Orange bought these houses behind the church of Saint Denis from a family called Frankenhoff and had them rebuilt into a sober palace. When William succeeded his father as king of the Netherlands in 1840 the palace didn’t have the royal quality befitting his new status. A new palace had to be constructed. The former palace was demolished in 1847. Façade of the palace on a draft of the palace around 1845.  Design  According to legend king William II made the first sketches for the palace himself, following the neo-gothic building style he knew from his childhood in England. It’s very likely that drawing teacher Frederik Lodewijk Huijgens of the royal military academy in Breda and royal master builder Jan C. Boon were involved into the design. The building's basement is about 60% subterranean and 40% above ground. This was common among houses, castles and palaces at the time. On top of the basement sits the piano nobile, the most important and impressive floor of the building, primarily used for receiving guests. Notable to the design are the four round towers at each of the four corners of the building. These form four independent stairwells and lead from the basement up to the piano nobile and the second floor.  School  Vincent van Gogh in 1873. Survey of the Rijks-HBS Koning Willem II in 1866. Also the surrounding of the school is on the map, like the Saint Denis church. The buildings around the palace like the gym and the laboratory, which are both in one building, the art school and the caretaker's house were all demolished later.\\"Jaren van voorzichtig beleid\\" Ter gelegenheid van het 125-jarig bestaan van de Rijksscholengemeenschap Koning Willem II in Tilburg (1866-1991),  Rijks- HBS  By the second half of the 19th century 28,000 people lived in Tilburg. A need was felt for a HBS, a then new type of high school for secular education. It was aimed at bourgeois pupils as preparation for 'higher' positions in society, better adapted to the economic demands of a rapidly changing society than the Latin school. It was meant for middle class youth who didn't need an academic education, but required a broad general knowledge to fulfil important positions in trade and industry.  Koning Willem II School  Although the city council wanted to provide this new type of education to the city's inhabitants, Tilburg did not receive state financial support for a school building. As the city couldn't afford a new building, it was suggested that King William II's palace be used for the new school. The palace was still owned by the Dutch royal family. On 30 November 1863 the city council sent a letter to the secretary of the royal family, requesting the palace's use as a school building. Authorisation came in 1864 and in 1865 alterations to the building began. On 9 April 1866 the palace was opened as a school, named: Koning Willem II (King William II). One of its first students would also become its most famous alumni: Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, then 13 years old, attended classes in 1866 and left the school for unknown reasons in 1868. With an average rating of 7.36 (on a scale from 1 to 10) young Vincent was a mediocre student. His art teacher was the painter Constant Cornelis Huijsmans.  Controversial beginning and the continual growth  The first 25 years of the school’s existence were tough. There was a large turnover of staff and the number of students remained small. The lack of religious education caused a lot of criticism from the Roman Catholic clergy. Initially the school offered tuition to boys only; in 1894 the first girl was signed up – Maria Bes, daughter of the mathematics teacher. She passed her exams in 1899 and went to Delft to study engineering. She became one of the first female engineers in the Netherlands. In the 1920s electric light and central heating were installed in the building and the 50-year-old desks were replaced. In 1934 the school moved, for lack of space, to a new location at the Ringbaan Oost in Tilburg.  City hall  Stained glass windows in the half circular stairwell, made by .  Alteration of 1934–1936  In 1934 the palace was 85 years old and for about 70 years it had functioned as a school. The building was totally decrepit and had to get renovated and altered. In 1931, when the building was still used as a school, the city council already considered using the palace as the new city hall. , an architect from Nijmegen, was commissioned by Tilburg city council to alter the decrepit school into a representative Palace-Council House. Leeuw tried to restore the original character of the building. He brought back the long lost merlons and made the building more gothic than it ever was by replacing the square windows with lancet windows. The thin and slender towers near the entrance with the pinnacles on top were replaced by a middle risalit, with an entrance made in art deco style. On 1 August 1936 mayor reopened the reconstructed Palace-City Hall.  Interior  The alteration of the Palace-City Hall also changed its interior. The basement got a separate entrance at the east side. The piano nobile was completely rearranged. In the northern wing two wedding rooms were built. In the southern wing the mayor’s office was constructed. At the east side, above the entrance to the basement, a half circular balcony was built. With a similar half circular extension, a new and elegant stairwell was made, which contains a broad marble spiral staircase. The circular extension have stained glass windows made by stained-glass artist . The scenes in the stained glass express the virtues of a number of administrators and figures from classical antiquity. On the second floor three halls were built. One big wedding room in the north wing and a big hall for the city council itself, complete with a press gallery in the southern wing. A smaller room between the wedding room and the council chambers was made for the aldermen. On the lintel beam a fresco is made by Henri Sicking. It’s a symbolical representation of a prosperous future in an urban society of culture and economy. Expressed by a woman, flanked by a man and a woman, writing on a banner which has been draped over a book support with the Latin words: 'CVLTVRA' and 'OECONOMIA' on it. The latter is derived from the Ancient Greek οἰκονομία. Respectively these words mean: 'culture' and 'economy'.

Since the normal greeting of Muslims i.e. \\"Assalamu Alaikum\\" was meant for Muslims only,Sahih Muslim, Hadith # 2167 (According to International Numbering) and Muslims in India lived in a multi-faith and a multi-lingual society, this alternative form of greeting was coined. Its use became so pervasive in the high culture of northern and central India that it was not considered inappropriate to reply to 'salaam' with 'aadaab' and vice versa and it was used frequently in non-Muslim households as well. The phrase and gesture has decreased in use in both Pakistan and India because they are perceived as insufficiently Islamic compared to other greetings. The gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the finger tips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward. It is typical for the person to say \\"adab arz hai\\", or just \\"adab\\".

Frisby during the first year of his term as Provo City Mayor. \\"The House is a somewhat modest Victorian Eclectic house type that was most likely influenced by house pattern books. This house type was not used in Salt Lake City, or in many other areas of the state, but was inexplicably popular in Utah County (Historic Provo p. 8).\\"  Structure  Front \\"The Joseph H. Frisby house is a two story brick house with an irregular plan. The irregular plan is determined by the roof configuration of a central pyramid intersected on three sides by projecting gables. A one story porch wraps around the northeast corner of the facade and is terminated at each end by one of the projecting opelted wings. The porch is supported on Tuscan columns that extend from the side of one gabled wing under the eaves of the pyramidal roof to the other gabled wing. Classical detailing appears in the cornice and in the porch. The boxed cornice has brackets and a frieze decorated by dentils. A pediment with Classical Revival decoration on its tympanum and dentils on its frieze is located above the steps leading to the main entrance. Of particular note in the fenestration are the second story windows which have a triangular top above which the brickwork is in the configuration of a four-center ogee and a key-hole, and an oval stained glass window on the south wall of the first floor. A rear extension, which may have been a later addition, was most likely added soon after the original structure was built, and complements the house in its massing and fenestration (National Park Service p.2).\\"  Joseph H. Frisby and Charles Hopkins  Joseph H. Frisby was born in Birmingham, England in 1850, and was an English immigrant. He came to Utah in 1864, crossing the plains by ox team, and settled in Coalville, where he remained for several years until he went to Arizona. He settled in Provo in the year 1903, and had this house built soon after in 1905. Frisby lived at this location until 1913, when he sold this house and moved down the street to 258 North 400 West, where he died two years later. Joseph H. Frisby lived a significant life, having served as a justice of the peace, having operated a mercantile business, and having been mayor of Provo for two years. Frisby's election was tangled up in controversy. During this time, the town of Provo was divided. Needing a railroad, the east side of town insisted that it be built on the east side of Provo, while the west insisted it belonged on the west side. Hoping to sway the decision, the west side of Provo nominated Joseph Frisby for mayor in hopes that he would act in their favor. Having won the election but narrowly, Joseph decided to postpone the decision until he was out of office. Joseph Frisby sold his house to Charles Hopkins in 1913. Hopkins, born February 21, 1864, at Dorcetshire, England, immigrated to America in 1887 and settled in the town of Elkhorn, Montana. In Elkhorn Hopkins was primarily involved in mining and the mercantile business, as well as serving as the local postmaster for fifteen years. In 1912 Hopkins relocated to Provo, where he was elected to the Provo City Commission, where he served for thirteen years. Under his administration the City and County Building was built, the Provo Memorial Park was planned and most of Provo's streets were paved. Hopkins also served as the chairman of the Utah County WPA and FERA. He died November 9, 1936 in the Frisby House.

Philips Clarke in West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1921. The firm was active in South Florida for only a few years, but in that time designed a number of distinctive homes, apartments, churches, and commercial buildings. Harvey was a member of the West Palm Beach Planning Commission. Firm member Gustav Maass designed several railroad stations, and became a noted South Florida architect in his own right. History American National Bank Building, the first building designed by Harvey and Clarke Henry Stephen Harvey, born in Winona, Mississippi, in 1889, and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in 1914 with a B.S. in architecture. Later, he served in World War I in the Air Service branch as a second lieutenant of civil life, a position in which he planned and constructed aviation buildings at various aviation camps throughout the United States. Harvey remained in the Air Service for a few years after the war, until receiving an honorable discharge. By 1920, he had established an independent architectural firm in Palm Beach. L. Philips Clarke, son of Louis Semple Clarke, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but visited Palm Beach frequently since infancy. In the 1880s, his father built a home in Palm Beach, known as \\"Dulciora\\". Like Harvey, L. Philips Clarke graduated from UPenn and also served in World War I, enlisting in the Navy in 1917 as a chief machinist’s mate, when he worked on bomb diffusion machinery. After the war, Clarke wanted to return to the Palm Beach area to establish an architectural firm, but lacked experience to be eligible for a license. Harvey, intrigued by the possibility of an economic land boom, trained Clarke so he could pass licensing examinations. In exchange, Clarke apparently financed the firm, providing between $1,000 and $2,000 for startup funds. Overall, Harvey and Clarke designed over 200 commercial and residential buildings between 1921 and 1929, including 50 train stations for the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The firm estimated that between 1921 and 1925, they were responsible for $7 million in new construction in South Florida. Harvey served as a Mayor of West Palm Beach from 1924 to 1926. During the peak, at least 25 people were involved in the firm, including Gustav Maass. The firm offered small house plans to those unable to afford a personal architect. Initially, the firm survived the collapse of the 1920s land boom, but began to fail during the onset of the Great Depression. In October 1928, the month after a devastating hurricane, Clarke became supervisor of plans for new hotels and residences. Harvey moved to Birmingham, Alabama, before returning to Florida in 1933 to work at a hardware store in Miami Beach. Clarke remained in the architectural industry, designing buildings such as a school auditorium in Belle Glade in 1932 and a new City Hall for West Palm Beach in 1947. Several of the firms remaining structures were listed in the National Register of Historic Places or have otherwise been preserved. However, the Dixie Court Hotel was demolished in 1990 for construction of a new courthouse for Palm Beach County, while the Pennsylvania Hotel was demolished in 1995 and replaced with the McKeen Towers, a senior living facility.

The story mentioned in the cartoon is based on \\"The Gingerbread Man\\", published in St. Nicholas Magazine in 1875. Plot In a living room, Oswald and the boy beagle are listening to a radio, awaiting a program. Suddenly, they are interrupted by a baby dog from another room who is sucking a thumb very loudly. Not wanting to be bothered by the noise, the boy beagle approaches the small puppy and puts a boxing glove on the latter's hand. The two friends resume their waiting at the radio, only to be disturbed again by the bawling baby dog. The boy beagle then comes back to help the little mutt burp as well as giving a diaper change. While Oswald and the boy beagle are still anticipating at the living room, the baby dog comes to them, craving for chocolate pudding. This time, Oswald stands up and takes the little mutt to the dining room. The rabbit then provides a serving spoon and a bowl with the dessert. When the baby dog gets busy eating, Oswald and the boy beagle were finally listening to their sound system in peace. Their awaited program is a fairy tale about a live ginger bread boy. Once there was a spinster who desperately wanted to have children but simply couldn't obtain any. Thus she decided to create a boy out of ginger bread. After baking one in the oven, it came to life somehow. While the ginger bread boy is still on the table, getting used to his new life, the household cat sees and finds him delicious. The cat began running after the humanoid biscuit, much to the spinster's dismay. A clever dodger, the ginger bread boy was unfazed by the cat's ferocity and is able to keep himself at a safe distances. With a little help from the spinster, he eventually drove the fearsome feline away from household, resulting a favorable outcome for both him and his surrogate mother. Back in the living room, Oswald and the boy beagle were enjoying themselves, listening to the rest of their radio program. Just then, the baby dog comes in again, wanting to have a hobby after such a meal. Still having a large supply of chocolate pudding, the small puppy decides to splatter it on the faces of the two friends, thus leading to a friendly food fight. Directing Unusual to most shorts of the series, the person who directed the cartoon is not credited, although some believe it was Fred \\"Tex\\" Avery. The reason to this remains undisclosed. Differences from the original story In the original version of the fairy tale, the ginger bread boy ends up eaten by the animal chasing him, namely a fox. In this adaptation, he subdues his predator and remains alive. Also in the original story, the ginger bread would always try to run away from anyone (including his creator) just for pleasure. In the film, he cherishes his human mother and would not run off.

Volume 1 was released on August 3, 2010 and features songs from Average Joe's Entertainment and Backroads Records artists such as Colt Ford, Brantley Gilbert, The Lacs, Corey Smith and Sunny Ledfurd. Backroad as since released ten volumes of the popular title. In addition to country music, Average Joe's founded a southern urban genre-oriented subsidiary imprint called AVJ Records, specializing in southern rock, pop, R&B; and hip hop artists, including Nappy Roots, Anamul House and Rehab. In 2014, AVJ was also converted into a country- rap brand. Rehab was the only previous artist that remained on AVJ. A minor re-alignment also took place at this time moving Demun Jones and new artist Sarah Ross to the Average Joes brand and Danny Boone and Twang & Round to AVJ. Marketing In the early days of Average Joes, the company used unique practices what they referred to as \\"hi-tech/low-tech\\" marketing, where they leaned on both digital \\"direct to fan\\" social marketing along with face-to- face integrations tied in with artist's tours. Many of their early tours were in non-traditional small market venues that mostly included mud bogs and parks. Through this practice the company built massive direct to fan data bases. Management Average Joes Entertainment also formed a management arm that started in 2009 under the name Fullscope and was originally steered by Ken Madson. In 2011, Fullscope was re-branded as Average Joes Management and in 2019 rebranded as Arcade Management. Arcade is currently headed by Jamie Reeder. Past and current management clients include Colt Ford, Brantley Gilbert, The Lacs, Tyler Farr, John Michael Montgomery, Sister Hazel, Gaelic Storm, Josh Gracin, Nappy Roots, Bubba Sparxxx and more. Film and television In 2011, Average Joes formed Hideout Pictures to focus on film and television. Recent projects include CMT's Still The King starring Billy Ray Cyrus, Joey Lauren Adams and Madison Iseman, Jay and Silent Bob Reboot directed by Kevin Smith, 3022 starring Kate Walsh, Omar Epps and Miranda Cosgrove and more. Other subsidiaries AJE also owns motor-sports league Mega Truck Series and clothing line Slinger.

In other words, there is only one tonality in a piece, and every segment formerly considered as another tonality is only a region, a harmonic contrast within that tonality...subordinate to the central power of [its] tonic.

He started with White Owl cigars, and later endorsed Jell-O pudding and gelatin, Coca-Cola (including New Coke), Texas Instruments, E. F. Hutton & Co., Kodak, and the 1990 United States Census. , Cosby held the record for being the longest-serving celebrity spokesperson for a product, through his work with Jell-O. In 2011, he won the President's Award for Contributions to Advertising from the Advertising Hall of Fame. Cosby was one of the first black people to appear in the United States as an advertising spokesperson. He was known for his appeal to white consumers in the second half of the 20th century, in an industry seen as slow to accept diversity. In spite of making contradictory soft drink pitches and endorsing a disgraced financial company, he continued to be considered effective and believable. In the 1980s, studies found Cosby the \\"most familiar\\" and \\"most persuasive\\" spokesperson, to the point where Cosby attributed his wealth to these contracts, as opposed to his television series. However, in 2014, allegations of sexual assault significantly damaged Cosby's public image; public opinion polling following the news placed him near the bottom of a list of 3,000 personalities, when rated on trust and effectiveness. Public opinion of him dropped substantially in 2014, by many sexual assault accusations, the earliest of which dates back decades. More than 60 women accused him of rape, drug-facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse, and sexual misconduct, although the statute of limitations had by then expired in nearly all cases. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault in April 2018, and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison in September 2018. Personality Anthony Tortorici, director of public relations at Coca-Cola, told Black Enterprise magazine in 1981 that the \\"three most believable personalities are God, Walter Cronkite, and Bill Cosby.\\" At the peak of his advertising career in the mid-1980s, Cosby had a Q Score of 70, meaning that 70 percent of those responding to a survey of 1,000 United States residents thought highly of him, thus deeming him the most familiar and persuasive endorser.Pendergrast, p. 362 In 2003, industry publication Advertising Age said that \\"during [Cosby's] 14-year reign over the ad industry's public approval index [he had only been surpassed by] the Pope. In 2012, the separate Celebrity DBI index listed Cosby as second most-trusted celebrity on a list of celebrities people pay attention to on television, behind Morgan Freeman. Professionally, Coca-Cola advertising director John Bergin considered Cosby the company's \\"greatest weapon\\", stating that \\"magic happens when the camera starts.\\" Bergin also noted, however, that he found Cosby to be \\"inconceivably arrogant\\", and mentioned \\"blow-ups\\" on the set.Pendergrast, p. 147 Cosby biographer Linda Etkin said that Cosby \\"comes across as a father figure, a teacher, and a friend\\" in his advertisements. William Turner, in 1982 the marketing manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said that Cosby \\"represents comfort, and people trust him\\". In 2014, one educator asked for comment said he remembered Cosby as a \\"black male authority figure, one of those people who folks that don't live on the edges of the country think of as a good black guy; they trust that guy\\". In 1988, a representative for Kodak said Cosby had become \\"synonymous with quality products and quality services\\". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby has the advantage of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, \\"if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I think I do better than anybody\\". An article in Black Enterprise said part of Cosby's mystique is \\"that he can endorse a number of products and still retain credibility in each individual sell\\". Shortly after being signed by Coca-Cola, Cosby appeared at a bottlers' convention. He refused to drink the bottle of Coke he carried on stage, saying, \\"I'm waiting for all the Jell-O pudding I ate to settle\\". Cosby said that in childhood, he experienced \\"periods of addiction\\" to Coca-Cola, consuming fifteen bottles by 2 pm. Career in advertising 1960s Nat King Cole plays a piano, 1946, a photo pre-dating his television series. The American advertising industry was initially reluctant to use black spokespeople for fear of angering white customers. The Nat King Cole Show (1956-1957), the first nationally syndicated U.S. television series to be hosted by an African American, never found a national sponsor; after its cancellation Cole said, \\"Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark\\".; ; the books say Revlon was the specific instigator of the remark. Cosby's first advertisement was for White Owl cigars. His agent approached them in 1965, before the debut of I Spy, but after several appearances on the late-night talk program The Tonight Show, a signifier of success in American comedy. He told agent Norman Brokaw of William Morris Agency that he liked their tagline, \\"We're going to get you.\\" Cosby later said there were no commercials \\"with a black person holding something, buying a product, so the absence of pictures, in retrospect, said a lot\\". Despite the stigma among advertisers around using a black spokesperson, sales of the product rose. According to an entry in Ad Age Encyclopedia, the public acceptance of Cosby and Robert Culp appearing as equals on I Spy made it possible for advertisers to show black people and white people together in their commercials. The Bill Cosby Radio Program, which debuted in 1968, was sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. The series was syndicated to over 200 radio stations by McCann Erickson, Coca-Cola's advertising agency. 1970s In 1974, Cosby began promoting Jell-O pudding for General Foods. Cosby said comedian Jack Benny, whose program the brand sponsored, was the only previous spokesman for Jell-O, but Kate Smith, Lucille Ball, and Andy Griffith have also pitched the brand. In previous campaigns since the brand's launch in 1902, it was targeted towards parents rather than to children, a practice from which the company departed in 2001. Cosby's early commercials were unscripted, but later were written by comedy writers. Cosby disagreed with the writers, who wanted to say the food was for when you were \\"hungry\\"; Cosby thought there was not enough substance to satisfy hunger and wanted to use the word \\"appetite\\". In 1979, General Foods introduced Pudding Pops, the company's first frozen dessert product. With Cosby as spokesperson, it sold US$100 million its first year. After introducing Gelatin Pops and frozen Fruit Bars, the company's frozen desserts sales reached $300 million. Cosby was engaged to promote the flagging Jell-O gelatin product line in the mid-1980s, when General Foods introduced a holdable Jell-O product called \\"Jigglers\\". Sales increased seven percent during the first year of the promotion. Cosby appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola's 1979 campaign, \\"Have a Coke and a Smile,\\" and made a guest appearance at the Great Get-Together, a major bottlers' convention held that year.Pendergrast, p. 324 This campaign continued into 1981. His work in this decade was well received. Advertising Age named Cosby the top advertising personality of 1978. In 1999, Advertising Age magazine named Cosby's 1975 Jell-O commercials, which they called \\"Bill Cosby with kids\\", the 92nd best advertising campaign of all time. 1980s Black Enterprise magazine found that Cosby was one of only a very few African Americans who could command among the highest fees paid for advertising spokespeople. The 1981 feature also highlighted how rare it was for African Americans to be hired for a complete campaign, as opposed to a single advertisement, despite an overall increase in opportunities. Cosby's agents told the magazine he had earned at least $3 million in current advertising contractsabout one-fifth of his incomethe rest of which he earned from live performances. Cosby returned as Coca-Cola's spokesperson in its 1982 \\"Coke Is It\\" campaign, a series of commercials mocking the Pepsi Challenge. One advertisement in this series showed a Pepsi vending machine to mock the brand, which author Mark Pendergrast called \\"unthinkable\\". Another said Pepsi Challenge commercials were misleading because they never showed anyone choosing Coke. John Bergin, who directed the series of commercials, personally disliked Cosby but said his presence in Coca-Cola advertising ended the first Pepsi Challenge campaign in 1983.Pendergrast, p. 346 In mid-1982, Cosby was hired by Texas Instruments to appear in television advertisements for the company's TI-99/4A home computer. He was to be paid $1 million a year for the campaign. Pages 225 and 230. The company touted Cosby's education and rapport with adults and children. The campaign was aimed at parents, rather than children, as was the campaign for the Commodore 64. Cosby was the face of a mystery rebate program, offering reimbursements of between $3 and $1,000. J. Fred Bucy, who was head of Texas Instruments' home computer operation in 1983, scrapped Cosby's advertisements to focus on the product's educational value. Radio Shack vice-president of marketing David Beckerman said, \\"A celebrity draws attention to the product. Even if we had President Reagan on our ads, we wouldn't sell any more computers. A product sells itself. A celebrity causes indirect sales.\\" Cosby, along with entrepreneur James Bruce Llewellyn, bought stock in a Philadelphia Coca-Cola bottler in 1983 as part of the company's push to increase African American participation in the company. This was, in part, a response to pressure by Jesse Jackson's PUSH campaign. Spots with Cosby calling Pepsi too sweet were ill-advised, given the introduction of the reformulated sweeter tasting \\"New Coke\\". At the height of the Cola Wars, marketer Sergio Zyman persuaded Coca-Cola executives to create and air commercials with Cosby praising Coke for being less sweet than Pepsi, which was aired only in areas where sales of Pepsi were dominant. One commercial from the series features Cosby \\"rubberfacing an icky frown\\" and describing Pepsi as \\"gooey\\". These advertisements were broadcast from October 1984; Coca- Cola's independently owned bottlers demanded the commercials were run in their markets as well. Zyman said despite the upcoming contradiction, the ads were the first boost to Coke's image in years. Coca-Cola was simultaneously testing possible new variations of its soft drink and decided it would sell more product if it used a sweeter formula. Once New Coke was launched, Pepsi prepared its public response to the change; among its talking points for journalists writing about New Coke was to \\"Ask them about those Bill Cosby ads\\".Oliver, page 129. One of a new series of Coke advertisements showed Cosby dressed in a toga; this campaign was described as unconvincing. Coca-Cola faced a widespread public backlash, internal dissent, and ultimately the original drink recipe returned as \\"Coca-Cola Classic\\".Pendergrast, pp. 354–371 In the days following the reversal, an editorial cartoon featured Cosby pouring a can of Pepsi into a can of Coke.Oliver, page 143. Marcio Moreira, a McCann Erickson creative executive behind the New Coke introduction, said in 2011 that the decision to hire Cosby was not made until other commercials were being edited. The Cosby Show debuted in 1984, becoming \\"TV's biggest hit in the 1980s\\" and reviving both the sitcom genre and NBC. Before the series premiere, Cosby told reporters his income from commercials for Coke and Ford, as well as his Las Vegas shows, had made him financially secure. At some point before 1985, Cosby featured in advertisements for Bird's Eye frozen foods. In 1986, Cosby's only contract was with Jell-O, but by the end of the year he had added two more endorsements. By August, Cosby began promoting E. F. Hutton & Co. with a series of print and television advertisements, and comedy concerts. The company had been accused of fraud and needed a spokesperson who was well- liked. Soon after Cosby's commercials aired, the company merged with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. In late December, he added J. Walter Thompson agency account Kodak Colorwatch System photographic processing system to his list. The estimated $10 million contract included commercials featuring Cosby to run in print, on television, as point of sale, and in promotional programs. Coca- Cola purchased Columbia Pictures in 1982.Pendergrast, p. 374Pendergrast, p. 386 In 1987, Columbia decided revenues from its spy comedy Leonard Part 6 (1987) would offset its losses on Ishtar (1987). Leading up to release, Columbia announced it would spend $12 million on \\"synergies\\" with the film, taking into account the success of Cosby's television series and record sales for his parenting book, Fatherhood. Promotions included posters, spy cameras, point of sale standees of Cosby, and a contest to win Porsche cars.Pendergrast, p. 387, as referenced in Pendergrast on page 386, citation on page 516. Cosby, who acted in and produced the film, was initially supportive of it, but close to the release date he publicly distanced himself from it. The film failed, with a net loss of $33 million. In the 1980s, Cosby also appeared in public service announcements. To increase black participation in the 1990 United States Census, the bureau recruited Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople. 1990s to 2010s Partnership for a Drug-Free America. He is seen with a production assistant and Ginna Marston, an advertising executive who produced the spot This Is Your Brain on Drugs. Cosby also created a 1971 album titled Bill Cosby Talks to Kids About Drugs. Cosby continued to be a Jell-O spokesman through the 1990s. He was present for the lighting of the brand's first billboard in New York's Times Square in 1998. In 1999, Cosby's 25th year as spokesman for Jell-O, was also the final year he appeared in its advertising. The company distributed 120,000 copies of his picture book series, Little Bill, into American public libraries. Despite the transitions of advertising agencies and despite the 1989 merger of General Foods into Kraft, the then-newly merged company Kraft General Foods let Cosby remained with Jell-O as their spokesperson. He appeared at the Utah State Senate in 2001 to designate Jell-O the official state snack, and made a promotional visit to the Jell-O Gallery in 2004. In 2010, Cosby returned to Jell-O as executive producer for the company's \\"Hello Jell-O\\" campaign. In return, the brand sponsored his weekly web show OBKB, a children's interview series similar to Kids Say the Darndest Things. As of 2002, Cosby's time with Jell-O was considered the longest- standing celebrity endorsement in American advertising history. In the 1990s, Bill Cosby was also the spokesperson for Service Merchandise. At the Advertising Hall of Fame induction ceremonies on March 30, 2011, Cosby was the first winner of the American Advertising Federation's President's Award for Contributions to Advertising, for special achievements in the field. Criticism In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby was past his prime. Among the reasons, \\"making spokesman commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He has evolved into a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been\\". \\"The Noble Cos,\\" a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of- touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, \\"So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars ... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa ... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man ... I'm proving that all men are brothers.\\"; quote believed to have originated in \\"Sharing Humor, Sharing Tears\\", St Louis Post-Dispatch, 20 January 1997. In 1981, Cosby told Black Enterprise magazine: Sexual assault and rape allegations In October 2014, a stand-up comedy routine by Hannibal Buress, addressing allegations of rape against Cosby, went viral on YouTube. On November 10, Cosby posted a message requesting meme images, using a hashtag of #CosbyMeme, on his Twitter feed. Many of the images posted in response related to the allegations, which were fresh in the respondents' minds. After numerous women came forward as victims of Cosby's alleged actions, a television special and a series in development were cancelled. Cosby refused to address the situation; his lawyer said such actions would dignify \\"decade- old, discredited\\" allegations. Many media outlets commented on the way such actions clashed with his image as \\"America's Dad\\". One of the accusers felt nobody would believe her claims at the time of the alleged incident, given Cosby's status in advertising. Joan Tarshis told the media that Cosby was \\"Mr America; Mr Jello, as I called him\\". The publicity surrounding the allegations had a drastic effect on Cosby's reputation, as seen in the following drop in his ratings. In March 2013, Cosby had a 76.3 rating on the Davie-Brown Index, a rating of the public perceptions of roughly 3500 personalities published by Omnicom Group company The Marketing Arm, placing him as the third most-trusted celebrity, behind Morgan Freeman and Dr. Mehmet Oz. By November 19, this had fallen to 57.1, placing him at either the 2,626th spot or 2615th, depending on the source. The same company's separate rating on who consumers view as an \\"effective product spokesperson\\" saw Cosby drop to 2,746th spot; at one point, he had been 5th. Awareness of Cosby increased from 63rd to 51st. The Marketing Arm warns about misinterpreting the ratings fall; it said 900 celebrities were within the margin of error for Cosby's rating. At the time of the accusations, E-Poll Market Research had not updated its scores; a Q Score for Cosby was not expected until 2015. The executive vice-president of Q Scores Co. said polling in the midst of a scandal would likely overstate the score's longterm effects. All three companies' scores are updated at different intervals, meaning they are not directly comparable. Jell-O was relatively unaffected on social media by allegations against Cosby. The brand was mentioned in one percent of posts about Cosby, which was considered low. Still, negative connections continued, including by rapper Eminem in a freestyle rap, and an article by Food Drink and Franchise magazine pointed out moments in commercials that were awkward in retrospect. The numerous accusations of rape, drug facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse, and sexual misconduct spanned from 1965 to 2008 across ten U.S. states and one Canadian province. On September 25, 2018, Cosby was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in state prison for sexual assault for an assault against Andrea Constand.

It is an adventure/quest novel which is a sequel to her debut novel The Eight. The main character, Alexandra Solarin (daughter of Catherine Velis), must enter into a cryptic world of danger and conspiracy in order to recover the pieces of the Montglane Service, a legendary chess set once owned by Charlemagne. The novel contains several repeated elements from The Eight and was a New York Times Bestseller for six months.The Fire « Katherine Neville  Plot summary  The Fire is launched thirty years after the events of The Eight, when the a chess piece from the Montglane Service mysteriously resurfaces in Russia. The children of the previous characters know nothing of the quest of their parents, but are drawn into it nonetheless — and “The Game” is afoot again. The plot moves between modern day and the early 1800s, 30 years after the French Revolution. In 2008, Alexandra arrives to find that her mother is missing and that a series of strategically placed clues, followed swiftly by the unexpected arrival of a mysterious assortment of house guests, indicates that something sinister is afoot. Alexandra is swept into a journey that takes her from Colorado to the Russian wilderness and at last into her own hometown: Washington D.C. In 1822, Haidee – the daughter of a powerful ruler in the Ottoman Empire – is sent on a dangerous mission to smuggle a crucial piece of the Montglane Service out of Albania to the hands of the one man who might be able to save it. Haidee’s journey from Albania to Morocco to Rome to Greece, and into the very heart of The Game, leads to revelations about the powerful chess set and its history.  Reception  The Fire received rave reviews, spending more than 6 months on bestseller lists around the world, including France, Spain, Holland, New York, Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, and DC. The Washington Post called the novel “[An] exotic, labyrinthine conspiracy tale . . . the perfect escapist adventure.” The Chicago Sun-Times stated, \\"Katherine Neville’s follow up to The Eight, a cult classic that impressed many readers as a more intelligent and literary precursor to Dan Brown’s The DaVinci Code. . .

Both studies are conducted at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, California. The research teams include uniformed officers as well as investigators from the Department of Defense and academic institutions. right Purpose The purpose of the Millennium Cohort Family Study is to gain a more complete understanding of the military experience and its impact on the health and well-being of Service members and their families. The Family Study also provides a unique opportunity to explore the impact of relationship quality on the physical and psychological health of Service members, their spouses and children. A comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by military families provides a vehicle to create truly effective interventions and support mechanisms. A cohort study follows a distinct group of people over an extended period of time. In epidemiological research, only a cohort study has the strength to describe long-term health outcomes that are of concern to the military. Important health facts, which may seem obvious now, were not always known to be true - they were learned through cohort studies. For example, we know that smoking causes lung cancer and that untreated high blood pressure causes heart disease, but less than 50 years ago, these relationships were not clear. Background More than 5 million US military personnel have been deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with nearly 800,000 deploying multiple times and over 3 million children and spouses directly affected by the deployment of a Service member. Family relationships play an important role in the functioning and well-being of US military Service members, yet few studies have examined the impact of deployment and occupational exposures on family members. Study design The Family Study is a longitudinal study designed to follow spouses of Service members from all branches of the military, including the National Guard and Reserve, for 21 years. Spouses of Service members participating in the Millennium Cohort Study were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire between 2011 and 2013 and will be re-surveyed every three years. Because families and family relationships change over time, spouses are asked to complete follow-up surveys every three years, even if their spouse is no longer in the service or their marital status changes. The questionnaire asks participants about their mental and physical health, the quality of their marital and family relationships, their deployment and reunion experiences, their perception of how their spouse is coping, and the effects of military life and deployment on their children. Participation in the Family Study is completely voluntary.

Shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the United States over the past decade, and interest has spread to potential gas shales in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia. One analyst expects shale gas to supply as much as half the natural gas production in North America by 2020. In a 2013 report, the US Energy Information Administration estimated the quantity of technically recoverable shale gas for 41 countries. North America leads the worldwide production of shale gas, with the US and Canada having significant levels.US Energy Information Administration, , 23 Oct 2013 Beyond the US and Canada, shale gas is so far produced at a commercial scale only in Argentina and China. While the shale gas potential of many nations seems promising, there are several obstacles spanning several economic, environmental, technical and social issues grouped in major categories such as access to resources, infrastructure and governance.Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre, 2015. \\"Pathways to Shale Gas Development in Asia-Pacific\\". URL http://aperc.ieej.or.jp/file/2015/11/25/Pathways_to_Shale_Gas_20151124.pdf Shale gas production has been blocked in many countries largely because of the environmental risks involved. These risks and social concerns have resulted in legal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, that have prevented a more extensive development of shale gas worldwide. Africa South Africa Map Showing Operator Permits in the Karoo Basin, South Africa South Africa has a major sedimentary basin that contains thick organic-rich shales: the Karoo Basin in central and southern South Africa. The Karoo Basin is large, extending across nearly two-thirds of the country, with the southern portion of the basin potentially favorable for shale gas. However, the basin contains significant areas of igneous sill intrusions that may impact the quality of the shale gas resources, limit the use of seismic imaging, and increase the risks of shale gas exploration. The Karoo is estimated to have technically recoverable resource of 485 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas. Several companies intend to explore for shale gas using hydraulic fracturing in the Karoo region. This is bitterly opposed by a coalition of environmentalists, farmers and local residents. Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd. was an early entrant into the shale gas play of South Africa, obtaining an 11,600-mi2 (30,000-km2) Technical Cooperation Permit (TCP) along the southern edge of the Karoo Basin. Shell obtained a larger 71,400-mi2 (185,000-km2) TCP surrounding the Falcon area, while Sunset Energy holds a 1,780 mi2 (4,600-km2) TCP to the west of Falcon.

Facing Energy Shortage, Argentina Steps Up Pressure on YPF-Repsol. World Politics Review. (Posted: 11 Apr 2012) Large reserves of tight oil and gas were in the Vaca Muerta formation. In 2014, three-quarters of the shale gas and oil concessions in the country were held by the Argentinian company YPF (nationalised in 2012) which committed to develop the Vaca Muerta field with US company Chevron Corporation. However, in spite of a hydrocarbons law favourable to exploring and developing companies and passed by the Argentine Senate in 2014, the Financial Times noted that \\"Some analysts doubt whether many companies will follow Chevron until Argentine's erratic president Cristina Fernandez, leaves power in 2015.\\"Mander, Benedict and Webber, Jude (3 November 2014) \\"YPF courts oil major to unlock Argentine shale\\" the Financial Times, page 19, Companies and Markets. A similar article is available on the Internet with a subscription at Canada Recent shale gas discoveries have caused a sharp increase in estimated recoverable natural gas in Canada.Carrie Tait, \\"Canada's natural gas resource jumps dramatically in estimates\\" , Montreal Gazette, 13 May 2010. The nation has a number of prospective shale gas targets in various stages of exploration and exploitation in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.Kevin Heffernen, Shale gas in North America, emerging shale opportunities , PDF file, retrieved 15 April 2009. One major area of exploration in Canada is north of Fort Nelson, in north east British Columbia. Encana and EOG Resources are developing the area known as Horn River due to its high yield shale deposits. A number of these well sites are serviced by Alberta fracturing companies, many of which started out as a one-person operation with the purchase of a cement truck. This rapid expansion of shale gas in Canada is not without controversy. On 8 March 2011, the Quebec provincial government effectively declared a temporary moratorium on the use of chemical fracturing during shale gas drilling pending a stricter full environment assessment audit. Acting under recommendations from a provincial environmental assessment board, Quebec Minister of Environment Pierre Arcand stated that \\"We are committed to making sure that it is done properly or it won’t be done at all,\\"RHÉAL SÉGUIN, , Globe and Mail, 8 March 2011. The assessment board cites the chief concern of groundwater contamination with respect to the St. Lawrence valley, and recommended the audit in order to fully inform and involve communities and the public of the risks involved in shale gas exploitation in Quebec. Mexico Mexico drilled its first shale gas well in 2011, in the Burgos Basin of northern Mexico, in the equivalent of the Eagle Ford Formation of the US. But as of February 2013, there have been only six productive shale gas and tight oil wells drilled in Mexico (a seventh was abandoned as non-productive), all producing from Eagle Ford equivalent.David Alire Garcia, \\"Mexico still far from tapping shale potential, minister says\\", Toronto Globe and Mail, 8 May 2013. The national oil company Pemex has limited investment capital, and focuses its effort on what it sees as higher-return conventional oil and gas projects, rather than gas shales or tight oil.Roberto Lozano, The challenges for shale gas production in Mexico, 2013, Regional Workshop on the Changing Global Market and Unconventional Gas, Jakarta, Indonesia The US Energy Information Administration estimates Mexico's recoverable reserves of shale gas to be 681 trillion cubic feet, the fourth largest shale gas reserves in the world.http://geology.com/energy/world-shale-gas/ In Mexico's case, the relevance of shale gas passed from official speeches to energy policy priorities, with two scenarios of production included in the Energy Strategy 2012. With five shale basins preliminarily identified, the business-as-usual scenario in the Strategy encompassed the development of only one shale gas play, with the more favorable scenario adding another play. For each scenario, production would start by 2016 with the output expected amounting to 15% and 29% from the total gas production expected by 2026. By early 2013, the thrill of shale gas started to transform, with less fanfare in the edition of the Strategy that year, recognizing that in spite of the considerable shale gas potential, the path of development chosen would be constrained by Mexico's legal and economic framework, with more favorable opportunities depending on the implementation of more ambitious measures, namely an energy reform that could complement the state-owned oil and gas monopoly of more than 75 yearsJuan Roberto Lozano-Maya, The United States Experience as a Reference of Success for Shale Gas Development: The Case of Mexico, 2013, Energy Policy, Vol. 62. While this reform was eventually accomplished, other challenges must be surmounted.Dudley Althaus, \\"Zetas gang poses daunting threat to Mexico's shale gas\\", Houston Chronicle, 26 Sept. 2012. Mexico's shale oil and gas development close to the US border is hampered by the activities of organized criminal groups that include the theft of pipeline products and the extortion to companies in the extractive industries, along with lack of adequate infrastructure; overall, this has resulted in the low economic competitiveness of Mexico's shales in comparison with those across the border in the United States soil. It remains to be seen if the awaited Mexican energy reform will overcome these drawbacks. Owing to Mexico's weak rule of law and poor success in previous major industry reforms, the legal changes brought about might as well end up worsening the drawbacks in the energy sector and namely in the development of the country's shale resources. United States The first commercial gas well drilled in the US, in 1821 in Fredonia, New York, was a shale gas well producing from the Devonian Fredonia Shale formation. After the Drake Oil Well in 1859, however, shale gas production was overshadowed by much larger volumes produced from conventional gas reservoirs. In 1996, shale gas wells in the United States produced , 1.6% of US gas production; by 2006, production had more than tripled to per year, 5.9% of US gas production. By 2005, there were 14,990 shale gas wells in the US.Vello A. Kuuskraa, Reserves, production grew greatly during last decade Oil & Gas Journal, 3 Sept. 2007, p.35-39 A record 4,185 shale gas wells were completed in the US in 2007.Louise S. Durham, \\"Prices, technology make shales hot,\\" AAPG Explorer, July 2008, p.10. In 2007, shale gas fields included the No. 2 (Barnett/Newark East) and No. 13 (Antrim) sources of natural gas in the United States in terms of gas volumes produced.US Energy Information Administration, Top 100 oil and gas fields , PDF file, retrieved 18 February 2009. A study by MIT says that natural gas will provide 40% of America's energy needs in the future, from 20% today, thanks in part to the abundant supply of shale gas. With 4% annual production growth expected between 2010 and 2030, shale gas has been \\"a veritable game changer\\" for the United States. Shale gas, especially from the Marcellus Shale, have tested up to 16% ethane content. This low priced feedstock for ethylene synthesis has led to a \\"frenzy\\" of new ethylene plants in the US. Asia Turkey According to data obtained from the US energy information. Turkey has 679 billion cubic meter shale gas reserves, especially in the Southeastern Anatolia and Thrace regions, 651 billion cubic meters can be drilled in the first stage.https://thenewturkey.org/what-is-turkeys-shale- gas-potential China China has set its companies a target of producing 30 billion cubic meters a year from shale, equivalent to almost half the country's gas consumption in 2008. Potential gas-bearing shales are said to be widespread in China, although as yet undeveloped.Zinchuan Zhang, \\"Unconventional gas systems in China,\\" 33rd International Geological Congress, Oslo, 6–14 August 2008. In November 2009, US President Barack Obama agreed to share US gas-shale technology with China, and to promote US investment in Chinese shale-gas development.White House Blog, The US and China: towards a clean energy economy, 17 November 2009. China launched a national shale gas research centre in August 2010. Based on existing reports, China may have 30 trillion cubic metres of shale gas reserves.Reuters, China launches national shale gas research centre, 23 August 2010. In a 2011 report, the US Energy Information Administration estimated that China had 1,275 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas, the largest reserves of all countries surveyed in that report.World Shale Gas Resources: An Initial Assessment of 14 Regions Outside the United States. As of April 2012, Shell has already drilled a few wells in Sichuan. Notwithstanding the commercial production status reached in 2013, shale gas output remains marginal and at a preliminary stage in China. There are still many challenges to develop this type of unconventional gas resources on a massive scale. Because of the high population density across China, there are considerable water access limitations which must be taken into consideration in any scenario of rapid large-scale production.A Comparison between Shale Gas in China and Unconventional Fuel Development in the United States: Water, Environmental Protection, and Sustainable Development, Farah, Paolo Davide; Tremolada, Riccardo in Brooklyn Journal of International Law, Vol. 41, No. 2, 2016, June 2016. Oilfield services are dominated by Chinese companies, while the interaction with international companies experienced in the development of shale gas and supply chain solutions is minimal.Asia Pacific Research Centre, 2015. \\"Pathways to Shale Gas Development in Asia-Pacific\\".

Reliance Industries paid a reported US$1.7 bn for a 40% share in Atlas Energy's leasehold in the Marcellus shale gas play in the eastern US.Louise S. Durham, \\"Marcellus poised for even more attention,\\" AAPG Explorer, July 2010, p.24. A complication to shale gas in India is that the government-issued leases for conventional petroleum exploration do not include unconventional sources such as shale gas.S.A. Aiyar, \\"Shale Gas: Could it be a new energy source?\\" Times of India, 9 August 2009. However, this policy now has been changed under the Hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy, which provides a uniform license for exploration of conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources and includes private participation.http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hydrocarbon- policy-india-over-the-barrel-how-to-help/ In August 2010, a delegation including the director-general of hydrocarbons and officials of the oil ministry is scheduled to meet in Washington with the US Geological Survey to discuss help in identifying and exploiting shale-gas resources in India. Basins of preliminary interest identified by Indian geologists are the Cambay Basin in Gujarat, the Assam-Arakan basin in northeast India, and the Gondwana Basin in central India.R. Suryamurthy, \\"Shale gas mission to US\\", Calcutta Telegraph, 5 July 2010. During US President Obama's visit to India in November 2010, India and US decided to cooperate in the fields of clean-tech and shale gas. \\"We agreed to deepen our co-operation in pursuit of clean energy technologies, including the creation of a new clean energy research centre here in India, and continuing our joint research into solar, biofuels, shale gas and building efficiency,\\" Obama said.Jo , New Delhi, 8 November 2010. Indonesia According to the Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia has proven shale gas resources of 574.07 trillion cubic feet (tcf) or 16.3 trillion cubic meters distributed as follows:Unconventional Oil and Gas Potential in Indonesia with Special Attention to Shale Gas and Coal-bed Methane [The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Indonesia] 7 May 2013 Sumatra Island has 233.05 tcf proven resources, Kalimantan Island has 193.93 tcf resources, Papua Island has 94.04 tcf, Java Island has 47.64 tcf, and Sulawesi Island has 5.41 tcf proven resources. In Sumatra Island, the proven shale gas resources are in the North Sumatra province, Central Sumatra, Ombilin, and South Sumatra. Proven shale gas reserves also found in north-west and also north-east of Java Island. In Kalimantan Island, the proven reserves are in Barito, Kutei, Tarakan, Melawi, and Ketungau. Whereas, in Sulawesi Island, there is only one proven reserve, which is Sengkang. Lastly, in Papua Island, the reserves are found in Akimeugah and Bintuni. As of 2012, shale gas, like coal bed methane (CBM), is not yet being developed in Indonesia. The potential reserve of Indonesia shale gas is greater than either CBM or conventional natural gas, with 453 tcf and 334 tcf, respectively. The Indonesian government has established new regulations to reduce the cost of development of shale gas to ease the advancement of shale gas and bolster exploration both offshore and onshore. The government hopes that these new regulations will attract international as well as national investments. The vital part of this new regulation is that the government now treats oil and gas as oil and natural gas. The government also acknowledges the fracking technology, which makes shale gas exploration possible. There are some challenges in shale gas development in Indonesia even though that it has abundant resources of shale gas. First, there is a concern that hydraulic fracturing technology could affect the water system in certain areas. Advance and better technology must be applied if the developer wants to utilize the shale gas. Other challenges such as poor local governance, lack of incentives for investors, and insufficient infrastructure must also be addressed. Pakistan As of 2009, Pakistan stands 19th in the world in terms of total technically recoverable shale gas reserves. Pakistan has about 51 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of shale gas reserves. Pakistan consumes 100% of natural gas that it produces, so shale gas may be an area of future growth in Pakistan. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated shale gas at 586 Tcf against its 2011 estimates of 52 Tcf for Pakistan. More recent estimates as of November 2015, point to over 10,000 Tcf of Shale gas reserves, of which about 205 Tcf is technically recoverable as reported recently by Pakistan's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. Exploratory drilling continues. Europe Potential shale gas basins in western Europe (US EIA, 2011) While Europe has no shale gas production as yet, the success of shale gas in North America has prompted geologists in a number of European countries to examine the productive possibilities of their own organic-rich shales.GFZ, Gas shales in Europe .David Jolly, \\"Europe starting search for shale gas,\\" International Herald Tribune, 22 August 2008, accessed 18 March 2009.Peggy Williams, \\"Europe needs home-grown gas,\\", E&P;, 25 September 2009, accessed 25 October 2009.Danny Fortson, \\"Shale gas blasts open world energy market\\", The Sunday Times, 1 November 2010. Norwegian company Statoil is in a joint venture with Chesapeake Energy to produce Marcellus Formation shale gas in the eastern US, and has indicated interest in bringing knowledge gained in the US to European shale gas prospects. Russian giant Gazprom announced in October 2009 that it may buy a US shale-gas producing company to gain expertise which it could then apply to Russian shale gas prospects.Bloomberg, \\"Gazprom takes a look at U.S. shale-gas producer,\\" Moscow Times, 22 October 2009. In the Barnett Shale in Texas, French oil firm Total SA entered a joint venture with Chesapeake Energy, and Italy's ENI purchased an interest in Quicksilver Resources. A 2012 report from the European Commission states that, unlike the United States, \\"Shale gas production will not make Europe self-sufficient in natural gas. The best case scenario for shale gas development in Europe is one in which declining conventional production can be replaced and import dependence maintained at a level of around 60%.\\"Unconventional Gas : Potential Energy Market Impacts in the European Union There is a divergence of opinion among the Weimar Triangle countries with regard to shale gas development. France has introduced a ban, because of the risks connected to the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, while Germany has suspended operations awaiting further environmental assessments. In November 2012, a divided European Parliament approved committee reports which recommended that policy on developing shale gas should be set by each member country for itself, rather than by the European Parliament.BBC, MEPs divided over shale gas use, 20 November 2012. This was done despite intense lobbying by the Russian gas exporter Gazprom for an EU-wide ban on hydraulic fracturing.Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, \\"Poland's shale drive will transform Europe, if it does not drop the ball\\", The Telegraph, 21 August 2013. As of February 2013, five European countries had bans or moratoriums in place against hydraulic fracturing: France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria; Romania had recently lifted its moratorium.The Economist, \\"Frack to the future\\", 2 February 2013. The flood of shale gas in North America is credited with lowering the price of natural gas in Europe. Producers of liquified natural gas (LNG), which in 2008 had been preparing to ship their product to the United States, had to find new markets, and so increased their exports to Europe. The increased competition from LNG, as well as the prospect of shale gas development, has given European governments leverage to negotiate price reductions from the Russian gas exporter Gazprom.James Marson and Joe Parkinson, \\"In Reversal, Neighbors Squeeze Russia's Gazprom Over Natural-Gas Prices\\", Wall Street Journal, 1 May 2013.The New Power Map, Foreign Affairs, European Union Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard noted in 2013 that shale gas could be a \\"game changer\\" in helping Europe reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as the US has done, by switching from coal to less carbon-intensive natural gas. She cautioned, however, that shale gas would not reduce the need for greater energy efficiency and renewable energy.Sophie Yeo, Shale gas could be a \\"game changer\\", says EU climate chief\\" , 1 November 2013. Austria Exploration is underway in Austria, where OMV is working on a promising basin near Vienna. Bulgaria Hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking' is prohibited by moratorium despite the 30-million-euro contract signed with Chevron for the exploration of shale gas deposits in Novi Pazar. The exploration plans faced public disaffection that elevated to nationwide protests which led to the decision of the government to ban shale gas exploration in Bulgaria. Study of an additional five sites was planned. The Bulgarian government suspended Chevron's license for shale gas prospecting on 14 January 2012. Denmark The French oil company Total S.A. has announced that it will start drilling for shale gas in Denmark in 2013. Total has experience producing shale gas in the US.Tara Patel, \\"Total will start shale drilling in Denmark this year, CEO says\\", Bloomberg, 10 January 2013. The Danish affiliate, Total E&P; Denmark B.V., and the state-owned oil and gas company Nordsøfonden have been granted two onshore licences for exploration in Northern Jutland and North Zealand.Shale gas in Denmark, The Danish government has stated, that Denmark should be free of fossil fuels by 2050, and the Danish Energy Agency (Energistyrelsen) has determined that shale gas could be a sustainable link to a green transition in Denmark. France In 2011, following strong lobbying from Europe Écologie Euro MP José Bové against shale gas exploration in the Larzac area of southern France, the French government suspended three gas exploration permits \\"until at least this summer\\". The Environment minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet announced the creation of a commission charged with evaluating the environmental impact of shale gas production, adding \\"no authorizations for shale gas exploration will be given, or even considered, before the commission reports\\". The final report was expected in June 2011. On 20 July 2012, Environment minister Delphine Batho confirmed that the government would maintain a moratorium on shale gas exploration, saying: \\"nowhere in the world it has been proven that this exploitation can be done without major environmental impact and major health risks\\".Le gouvernement n'envisage pas de revenir sur l'interdiction de la fracture hydraulique On 14 Sept. 2012, French president François Hollande canceled seven permits for shale gas drilling. He declared \\"In our current state of knowledge, no one can tell that shale gas and oil extraction by hydraulic fracturing, the only technique known today, is free from serious risks to health and environment.\\"Gaz de schiste : Hollande ferme la porte à la fracturation hydraulique Le Monde, 14 septembre 2012 On 5 November 2012, despite a governmental study 'rapport Gallois' advising continuing study of new extraction methods of shale gas due to the groundwater pollution risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, French president François Hollande refused following pressure from the Green Party.

In the Netherlands some test wells were planned to be drilled in Boxtel,Ruimtelijke ordening, \\"Mijnbouwlocatie Boxtel-1 Brabant Resources\\", (in Dutch) accessed 15 May 2012 however it was stopped due to political questions. Up until now there has not been a shale gas well for exploration purposes. The drilling of such a well has been suspended by the Dutch government due to environmental concerns. The Ministry of Economic affairs, Innovation and Agriculture is currently researching the impact of shale gas exploitation, and the results are expected to be published by the end of 2014. Poland Potential shale gas basins in Poland (US EIA, 2011) 2011 estimates by the US Department of Energy in 2011 pegged out Polish shale reserves as the largest in Europe.US Energy Information Administration, \\"World Shale Gas Resources: An Initial Assessment of 14 Regions Outside the United States\\" US Department of Energy, April 2011. The authors of the report calculated that Poland had reserves of about 22.45 trillion cubic meters of shale gas, of which 5.30 trillion cubic meters was recoverable. Most of the shale gas about 3.66 trillion cubic meters is in the Baltic Sea Basin, about 1.25 trillion cubic meters within the region of Lublin province, followed by 0.4 trillion cubic meters in the Podlaskie province. 2012 estimates by the Polish Geological Institute put recoverable reserves at only around 350–750 billion cubic meters, and a 2012 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey estimated 38.09 billion cubic meters of recoverable gas. The reduced estimates, slow rate of exploration, legal and regulatory wrangling, and challenging geology saw most major companies, including ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil, Eni, and Talisman Energy, pull out of the country. In 2014 Reuters reported that Chevron and ConocoPhillips are the only two major international companies left. Nevertheless, Poland has more shale-gas exploration, drilling, and extraction in progress than any other European country. Poland is highly dependent on coal for electrical generation. Unlike in most of Western Europe, Polish coal mines are still active. Methane in the mine workings poses safety problems. Most methane is currently treated as waste, but studies show that coalbed methane can be profitably used as a gas resource. As of 2010, Poland imports two-thirds of its natural gas from Russia. Tapping shale gas resources would greatly boost Poland's proven reserves, and lessen the importance of gas imports from Russia.Dash for Poland's gas could end Russian stranglehold, The Times, 5 April 2010.Should Gazprom fear shale gas revolution?, BBC News, 8 April 2010. In June 2013 Occupy Chevron – an anti-fracking group occupied a field near the Polish village of Żurawlów, close to the city of Zamość. Opinions polls during the same year showed however that more than 70% of Poles were in favour of exploiting their shale resources. In November 2018 the Polish finance ministry determined that Polish gas would be unprofitable. The Polish politicians have struggled to curb the near-total dominance of coal within the domestic energy system, but the high hopes placed on shale gas has been a result of overstated gas demand projections combined with uncertain assessment of available shale gas resources Romania Romanian shale gas reserves could consolidate the country's role as the largest gas producer in Central Europe. In May 2012, the government temporarily suspended permits for shale gas exploration while waiting for the results of the EU's environmental studies on this energy source. In March 2013, Prime Minister Victor Ponta announced that the moratorium on shale gas exploration in Romania had been lifted. This decision could help boost domestic energy resources and reduce Romania's dependency on Russian gas. This decision sparked large nationwide protests aimed at banning the exploitation of shale gas and to remove the current government of Romania. Romania's National Agency for Mineral Resources has launched a study to determine the level of national shale gas resources, whilst a study conducted by the US Energy Information Administration, based on estimates made without exploratory drilling, has put Romania's unproven wet shale gas technically recoverable resources (TRR) at a possible 1.4 trillion cubic metres (51 trillion cubic feet): the third largest deposit in Europe behind France and Poland. Energy company Chevron holds a number of concessions in Romania and has announced plans to begin exploration work there in late 2013. National energy corporation Petrom is also conducting preliminary analyses of its concessions and Romgaz, MOL, Sterling and East-West, and Zeta Petroleum have also all expressed an interest in further opportunities in Romania. Romania depends on imports to cover about 20% of its overall energy needs, according to data from the World Bank. Natural gas makes up close to 30% of national energy consumption. Of the total gas imported in 2010, (17% of the country's annual consumption) 98% of imports came from Russia. The recent US Energy Information Administration study has reported that there could be enough domestic shale gas to meet the country's needs for 100 years. Aside from job creation, Chevron has said that its investment alone in the country could total $600 million over the next 15 years. This is before the investment of other oil and gas exploration companies is taken into account. The Romanian government has come out in support of shale gas, citing energy independence and a decrease in the price of gas as motivations to pursue shale gas avenues. Energy Minister Constantin Niță has called for more exploration to determine the size of the shale gas deposits. Prime Minister Victor Ponta has also endorsed shale gas, saying he supports both exploration and exploitation. Sweden Royal Dutch Shell evaluated the viability of the Alum Shale in southern Sweden as a source of shale gas, but as of 2011 has declared that it is not viable and decided to abandon the operation.Royal Dutch Shell, Annual Report and Form 20-F for the year ending 31 December 2008 , p.25, PDF file, retrieved 16 April 2009. Other companies, e.g. Gripen Gas and Aura Energy continue to drill, prospect and report good finds. The company Gripen Gas completed test drillings outside Motala in the south-east of Sweden and reported that if all the gas were extracted, it would allow Sweden to keep up its current gas usage rate for 1,000 years. Gripen Gas announced in April 2012 the drilling results from their Ekeby Permit, onshore Sweden. Four shallow vertical wells tested the prospectivity of biogenic gas from the organic rich Cambro-Ordovician Alum Shale over an area covering about 150 km2. The prospective Alum Shale was encountered at depths of 75–85 metres in the wells and all wells had gas shows whilst drilling. One well cored the Alum Shale section. All wells were drill stem tested. Gripen Gas confirmed in October 2012 that Bergsstaten (Swedish Mines Inspectorate) had awarded the Sandön exploration licence covering 162 km2 in the western part of lake Vättern, in Östergötland County. The exploration licence is for biogenic gas exploration in the organic rich Alum shale formation. This new award plus the existing licences make Gripen Gas AB the principal gas explorer in Sweden at 583 km2. Aura Energy's recent announcement that they are about to start drilling at their Motala shale gas project in Sweden, is further evidence of the growing interest in unconventional gas resources. The managing director of Aura Energy, Dr Bob Beeson, a professional geologist with over 35 years of experience in mineral exploration and development, explained the company's position in Sweden. \\"Aura's Motala Project covers approximately 140 square kilometres of the Alum Shale. Dr Beeson said he was very excited about the project's potential, particularly as the Motala shale may share some similarities with a highly successful play in North America. \\"Gas flows of up to 50 cubic metres per hour have been reported from drill holes used to extract water, so it is definitely worth investigation,\\" he said. \\"Because of existing gas production in the region, rigs are available and we have already started to drill two out of the five holes.\\" Ukraine Ukraine has Europe's 3rd largest shale gas reserves at 42 trillion cubic feet (1.2 trillion cubic meters). Ukraine relies heavily on Russia for its gas imports. The EIA notes that the country produces 30% of its natural gas requirements and makes up the bulk from Russian and Turkmenistan imports. The administration states that its location makes it an important transit country for Russian gas supplies, and disputes have resulted in supply disruptions.Ryan W. Lijdsman Shale gas discoveries are potentially changing the game. Shell has signed on to explore an area that government estimates indicate could have 113 Bcm (4 Tcf) in reserves. The country's gas reserves have geologic similarities to its neighbor Poland, and the Lublin basin could be 10 to 15 times the size of the Barnett shale. It also suffers less from population and water issues that plague its neighbor to the northwest. But it suffers from the same bureaucratic issues that affect many other countries with shale deposits. \\"Lousy domestic policy remains the single greatest impediment to gas investments in Ukraine,\\" said Edward Chow, a senior fellow at the Center of Strategic and International Studies. Despite these issues, Chevron was proceeding with its plans to explore for shale in the Olesska field in the west of the country, according to Reuters. A government draft for a $10 billion shale gas production-sharing agreement has been approved. The draft was sent to the Cabinet of Ministers for a signature, the article states.

A number of wells have been drilled and a single shale gas well has been hydraulically fractured, but as of 2019, there has been no commercial production of shale gas in the UK. On 1 November 2019, following a report from the Oil and Gas Authority, the government called a halt to all fracking in the UK \\"with immediate effect\\" and warned shale gas companies that it would not support future projects.

After taking the chapel of San Alonso, Chagas headed for the Mission of San Carlos, where the independentist forces led by Andresito and Serapio Rodriguez awaited the Portuguese. After days of very intense fighting, the Portuguese managed to control most of the town and push Andresito's men to San Carlos' church and college, in which heavy fighting continued to occur, while they expected for reinforcements to come. However, the column of Captain Arand that had the objective of helping the rebels was attacked by the Portuguese and crushed, having its commander been killed. On the third day of battle, the buildings in which the rebels were caught fire, making their situation even more desperate and forcing them into submission, even though some men, including Andresito himself, managed to escape.

Filming took place in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The screenplay was written by Chuck Hustmyre and Brian A. Miller, based on Chuck Hustmyre's novel of the same title. Plot Ray Shane (Dave Bautista) is an ex-vice cop trying to turn his life around after spending 5 years in prison. He works as the head of security for The House of the Rising Sun, a strip club and illegal gambling den. During a night on the job, a masked gang hold him at gunpoint to rob the strip joint of $300,000, ending with the club owner's son, Peter (John G. Carbone), getting killed in the shootout. When the police arrive, they suspect Ray led the robbery. Ray's relationship with Jenny Porter (Amy Smart) is rocky following her regretful affair with Tony (Dominic Purcell), the right-hand man of his boss, when he was imprisoned. Ray is enlisted by his boss Vinnie Marcella (Lyle Kanouse) to track down his son's killers. He finds help from his former police colleague Jimmy LaGrange (Brian Vander Ark), who lends him information in his pursuit, but Vinnie and Tony start to believe they wrongly trusted him and that he is behind the robbery. That night, Tony and his partner, Joey (Franz Klain), attack Ray at his motel. After escaping, Ray stays with Jenny at her apartment, although Tony attempts to find him there, but Jenny does not let him in. During their conversation, She tells Ray she became a call girl only until his prison sentence ended. He forgives her and they make love. The next day, Ray meets with Charlie Blackstone (Craig Fairbrass), finding out Tony is planning to take over his boss Vinnie's position. He gets more info from one of the only surviving shooters involved with the robbery; the robbery was for an unknown inside man who killed the other shooters. The shooter refuses to bear testimony, and Ray kills him when threatened by a gun. Tony meets with Vinnie's older brother, Carlos (Danny Trejo), who Charlie works for. However, Tony is ordered to kill Charlie upon hearing he spoke with Ray, luring Charlie out of his house to kill him while Joey kills his wife, the latter murder which leads back to Ray because of his pocket knife. On the run, with the help of Jenny, Ray discovers Tony was involved in killing the shooters. Confronting Carlos with the development, it becomes known Tony's wife Priscilla is aiding his agenda by sleeping around with Carlos and distracting him so that Tony can take over his brother Vinnie's strip club. Offended, Priscilla shoots Carlos dead, but Ray avoids a bullet and shoots her dead. Ray calls the police. He informs Vinnie at his office they were both set up, with Tony framing Ray for the robbery and turning Vinnie's brother Carlos against Vinnie to eventually take over the club. Tony shows up with the money to confirm it as truth, and Jenny is being held hostage by his partner Joey. Tony is bitter that Carlos, who he worked with to build the company, handed it down to Vinnie, who vows revenge for the death of his son and betrayal before Tony kills him. With Tony offering $25,000, Ray's former co-vice cop Jimmy shows up to kill him for Tony, instead Jimmy gives Ray a gun causing a shoot-out. Ray takes cover, but Jimmy is hit, and Tony takes off with the money and Jenny down to the floor of the club. There, Jenny escapes with the money and tosses it to the strippers. In the parking lot, Ray fights Tony until the police arrive, and he tries to convince them Tony did the robbery and set him up. When Tony shoots towards Jenny, the police shoot him down. Jenny pleads to the police that Ray is innocent, but her testimony is insufficient and they still arrest him and take him into custody. In the end, Jenny is able to kiss Ray for a final time before he is driven off back to prison.

Team Lioness  Cpl. Jennifer San Martin, 24, a lioness attached to 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment, Regimental Combat Team 5, who is from Katy, Texas, searches an Iraqi woman as she travels through the checkpoint in Haditha City, Iraq, Saturday. The successes of Team Lioness and the later FETs is still under review, a report is due but no date has been set for its release. More American servicewomen have been killed and wounded resulting from hostile action in the Iraq War than in any other previous war, but this has more to do with the fact that there are more US servicewomen performing more missions than in any previous conflict. Official policy barred the armed services from assigning women to direct ground combat units in most situations. Instead, when commanders want to put talented women soldiers on combat teams, they must do so by temporarily \\"attaching\\" them to those units, or sending them in a support role, rather than an official combat role, thus Team Lioness was \\"attached,\\" but not assigned to infantry units. Their role was one of pacifying and attempting to win the hearts and minds of the local population.  Documentary  A documentary titled Lioness covered one of the first members of Team Lioness in Ramadi, Iraq between 2003 and 2004. Since its release in 2008, Lioness has contributed significantly to the mainstreaming of the movement to recognize and respond to the needs of American servicewomen. As a catalyst for military-civilian dialogue, the film has led to tangible change in a number of arenas by framing an important but largely invisible issue in meaningful human terms. Among the film’s notable accomplishments is its integration into the national veteran and Department of Defense healthcare infrastructures as a training tool for VA and military healthcare personnel. The film has also played a pivotal role in the passage of two critical pieces of legislation improving women veterans' access to healthcare in the VA system. The Women Veterans Healthcare Improvement Act, designed to increase availability of gender-specific services for women, was signed into law by President Obama on May 5, 2010, as part of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act. The Compensation Owed for Mental Health Based on Activities in Theater Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Act expanded the definition of combat, making it easier for all veterans to qualify for combat- related disability benefits.

In June 2020, Makani’s assets began to appear online available for public auction.  Technology  In order to meet its goal of producing low-cost renewable energy, the Makani kite-energy system uses autonomous tethered wings which fly in a circular path and generate electricity via wind turbines mounted upon the main wing, a method known as crosswind kite power, originally envisioned by Miles Lloyd in a 1980 paper. Loyd stated that for large scale purposes flying the generators was expected to be disfavored because of the need to fly the mass of the generators;Miles Loyd, 1980: homes.esat.kuleuven.be (pdf) many of Makani Power competitors have generators kept on the ground, like KiteGen, Italy.AWES Museum www.energykitesystems.net |KiteGen http://kitegen.com/ The electricity is transmitted to the ground via an electrical cable within the kite's tether. Several patent applications have been made; some have been granted. In December 2016, Makani operated for the first time a 600 kW prototype with 28 meter wing span. Since August 2018, Makani has operated an energy kite test site on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Mishaps  In 2019 the offshore energy kite was lost during testing. Investigation and reporting the technical details of the mishap are underway. The wing did not successfully land on the platform resulting in the loss of the energy kite.

The phones are certified for operation within military networks by the Joint Interoperability Test Command testing labs.  Firmware  In 2006 a firmware upgrade was made available for free for this series of phones adding the ability to use the phone with all SIP phone systems. The book SIP Security has an extensive section covering security of the 9600-series phones. SIP is now considered the de facto standard for connecting all unified communications including VoIP end devices. Firmware release 2.0 also provides Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). In 2009 firmware version 3.0 and 3.1 were released adding the ability to display JPG and JPEG images as screen savers, and supporting multicast receive audio. With the 3.1 firmware release these phones have the ability to create a VPN connection back to a corporate network to allow working remotely with a secure connection back into the office network. The VPN client built into the phones supports Avaya VPN gateways and other vendors gateways. By connecting the PC to the phone this will support both phone and computer operations back to the corporate network systems.  Current models  9621G IP DeskphoneThe 9601 is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) only phone for use with SIP Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems. The 9608 phone is an eight-line phone with directory and speed dial functions, with a monochrome display and four programmable keys. The device also supports Bluetooth headsets. The 9611G phone has a 3.5-inch color display and supports eight lines. The device has a built in gigabit Ethernet switch to allow a PC to connect to the network through the phone. The 9621G phone has a 4.3-inch color touchscreen. The 9641G phone has a 4.7-inch color touchscreen. The device has a built in gigabit Ethernet switch to allow a PC to connect to the network through the phone. The 9620L phone is a PoE Class 1 phone. The 9630G and the 9640G phones have advanced features and the 9630 can handle up to 24 lines. The 9650C phone is a receptionists style phone or is used by contact center agents. The 9670G phone has a 6.4-inch touchscreen, and is a cross between a PC and a phone. New applications can be downloaded into the phone to have access to Internet-based information. All of these phone models are designated as Class 1 PoE devices typically only drawing between 2.2 and 2.7 watts. This low power consumption decreases the total cost of ownership. All of the phones except for the 9601 can run firmware that allows communications over the H.323, or SIP protocols. Functionality The Avaya 9600 phone series supports DHCP functionality. This means that you can plug the phone into a standard Ethernet port and it will obtain an IP address for connectivity on a data network. Using this data connectivity the phone series is able to transmit Voice over Internet protocol or VoIP. The voice traffic is compressed to provide efficiency of transmission using one of the standard CODECs such as G711 or G729. In this way a data network connection can Multiplex both voice and data transmissions over a single physical link. Avaya 9600 phone models support a built in switch functionality. This allows a computer to be plugged into the back of the phone. The phone implements Data Bridging functionality so that a single data switch port from a data switch in the closet can support both voice and data services which is a significant savings over separate hard wired TDM connections for voice and data. Virtual Private Networking capabilities built into Avaya 9600-series phones means that companies with teleworkers may easily ship one of these phones to a remote location that has a cable modem or DSL Internet connection and with no manual configuration on the part of the remote worker the phone will securely connect back to the corporate network Call Router and Signaling Server and seamlessly make calling to the voice extension possible no matter where the phone is located. Caller ID, or Caller Identification is a phone feature that is able to display the phone number of the subscriber originating the voice call from the PSTN to the digital phone network such that the recipient is able to determine who is originating the call.

Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, et al., 895 F.2d 563 (9th Cir. 1990) was a lawsuit decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on February 2, 1990. Screenshot from reel 247 showing High Tech gays at 1989 Pride parade, Charles Cyberski papers (1994-03), Courtesy of Gay, Lesbian,Bisexual, Transgender Historical SocietyIn 1984, High Tech Gays, a social organization of gay people employed in the technology industry founded in 1983 in San Jose, California, All sources except this Times article date the founding of the organization to 1983, not 1973. challenged the policy of the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO), a unit of the U.S. Department of Defense, that routinely denied security clearances to applicants who were known or thought to be homosexual. The group brought the suit as a class action with three named plaintiffs. DISCO's policy was to deny high-level security clearances to anyone who had participated in homosexual activity within the past fifteen years and to require more extensive review of applications for security clearances on the part of gays. The plaintiffs were employed by businesses doing work under contract to the Department of Defense. In 1987, the District Court determined that laws that treat gay people as a class must be reviewed under the federal courts' heightened scrutiny standard because gay people are a \\"quasi-suspect class\\", noting that Bowers v. Hardwick held that only that \\"under the due process clause lesbians and gay men have no fundamental right to engage in sodomy\\". It found that the Defense Department's policy did not meet even its lowest standard of review, rational basis. The District Court stayed the enforcement of its decision during appeal after the Department of Defense presented arguments \\"based on new evidence from several sources indicating that hostile intelligence agencies target persons who are especially vulnerable, and that among others, persons who are gay people are considered vulnerable by these agencies.\\" The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision. It held that the proper standard of review was rational basis, citing Hardwick and writing that \\"the right to privacy inheres only in family relationships, marriage and procreation, and does not extend to all private sexual conduct between consenting adults.\\" Addressing the other criteria that would require the use of a different standard of review, the Court added that \\"Homosexuality is not an immutable characteristic; it is behavioral\\" and \\"homosexuals are not without political power\\". It found the Defense Department's policies were based on its determination \\"that counterintelligence agencies target homosexuals\\" and therefore were \\"rationally related to permissible ends\\". It also recognized that \\"Special deference must be given by the court to the Executive Branch when adjudicating matters involving their decisions on protecting classified information.\\"For a discussion of the Court's understanding of the targeting of gay people by foreign agents, see especially p. 148 n. 13. The plaintiffs' complaint was addressed on August 2, 1995, when President Clinton issued Executive Order 12968 prohibiting discrimination \\"on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information\\". of August 2, 1995.

Like extrusion, material is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990. Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later. Regardless of method, one of the greatest challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. \\"The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes.\\" Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size- related effects on the crystallite (grain) structure and boundaries. Development and use Microextrusion is an outgrowth of microforming, a science that was in its infancy in the early 1990s. In 2002, Engel et al. expressed that up to that point, only a few research experiments involving micro-deep drawing and extruding processes had been attempted, citing limitations in shearing on billets and difficulties in tool manufacturing and handling. By the mid- to late 2000s, researchers were working on issues such as billet flow, interfacial friction, extrusion force, and size effects, \\"the deviations from the expected results that occur when the dimension of a workpiece or sample is reduced.\\" Most recently, research into using ultrafine- grained material at higher formation temperatures and applying ultrasonic vibration to the process has pushed the science further. However, before bulk production of microparts such as pins, screws, fasteners, connectors, and sockets using microforming and microextrusion techniques can occur, more research into billet production, transportation, positioning, and ejection are required. Microextrusion techniques have also been applied to bioceramic and plastic extrusion and the manufacture of components for resorbable and implantable medical devices, from bioresorbable stents to controlled drug release systems. Microextrusion processes Like normal macro-level extrusion, several similar microextrusion processes have been described over the years. The most basic processes were forward (direct) and backward (indirect) microextrusion. The ram (which propels the billet forward) and billet both move in the same direction with forward microextrusion, while in backward microextrusion has the ram and billet moving in opposite directions. These in turn have been applied to specialized applications such as the manufacture of microbillet, brass micropins, microgear shafts, and microcondensers. However, other processes have been applied to microextrusion, including forward rod–backward cup extrusion and double cup (one forward, one backward) extrusion. Strengths and limitations Strengths of microextrusion over other manufacturing processes include its ability to create very complex cross-sections, preserve chemical properties, condition physical properties, and process materials which are delicate or dependent on physical or chemical properties. However, microextrusion has some limitations, though primarily related to the need for improvement of the relatively young process. Dixit and Das described it thus in 2012: > With the scaling down of dimensions and increasing geometric complexity of > objects, currently available technologies and systems may not be able to > meet the development needs. New measuring devices, principles and > instrumentation, tolerance rules, and procedures have to be developed. > Materials databases with detailed information on various materials and their > properties/interface properties including microstructures and size effect > would be very useful for product innovation and process design.

Its title comes from a street in Salvador, Bahia, where many cobblers once worked. It was originally released in 1938 as the B side to Salada Mista, which did not achieve the same level of success. This first recording was sung by Carmen Miranda with Orchestra Odeon. She never released the song on disc in the United States. The song was originally going to be featured in the Carmen Miranda film Banana da Terra (1939), but was replaced with \\"O Que É Que A Baiana Tem?\\", because of the high license fee demanded by Ary Barroso to use his song. However the song has been recorded many other times by a large number of artists. The song gained international fame when it was featured in the Disney film The Three Caballeros (1944). Notable covers The second recording of the song was in 1939, by Ary Barroso himself on the piano and Laurindo Almeida and Garoto on guitars. Other artists to record the song include Valdir Azevedo, Bola Sete, Elizete Cardoso, Dorival Caymmi, Luiz Bonfá, Paulinho Nogueira, Dilermando Reis, Baden Powell de Aquino, Lennie Dale and the Sambalanço Trio, Leny Andrade and the Breno Sauer Quarteto, Wilson Simonal, João Gilberto, Banda Black Rio, MPB4, Luiz Eça and Victor Assis Brasil, Gal Costa, Elis Regina, Toquinho, Raphael Rabello once with Ney Matogrosso and once with Romero Lubambo, Trio Mocoto, Eliane Elias, Léo Gandelman, Trio Esperança, João Nogueira, Nivaldo Ornelas and Juarez Moreira with Orquestra de Câmara Sesiminas, Rosa Passos and Lula Galvão, Caetano Veloso, and Raúl di Blasio. Baía The song, retitled \\"Baía\\" (also known as \\"Bahia\\"), was featured in the Disney film The Three Caballeros, with English lyrics written by Ray Gilbert and sung by Nestor Amaral. The lyrics to \\"Baía\\" are not a translation of Ary Barroso’s original Portuguese lyrics, and differ from them considerably. However, both songs share a similar theme of longing for the past. This version was very successful and has been played over a million times on US radio. Due to the popularity of the song, one million copies of sheet music were printed in the United States in 1945 alone. Notable covers of Baía On the official soundtrack of The Three Caballeros, the song was sung by Ray Gilbert with Charles Wolcott and his Orchestra. Some notable artists who have recorded this version of the song are Bing Crosby with Xavier Cugat and his Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra, André Kostelanetz and Orchestra, Jack Pleis and His Orchestra, Claude Thornhill, Caterina Valente with Werner Müller and his Million Strings, Luiz Eça and Victor Assis Brasil, John Coltrane, Herbie Mann, Mickey Baker, Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis and Shirley Scott, Percy Faith and his Orchestra, Trio Los Panchos and Chucho Martinez Gil, Ahmad Jamal, Ed Lincoln (as Don Pablo de Havana) and sua Orquestra, Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd, Perry Como, Walter Wanderley, Gato Barbieri, Catalyst, The Ritchie Family, Idris Muhammad, Lalo Schifrin, Santana, Herb Alpert, Ran Blake, Laurindo Almeida, Martin Denny, Perez Prado, Mel Torme and Cleo Laine, Johnny Mathis, Dionne Warwick, Plácido Domingo, Tete Montoliu, Mongo Santamaria, Arthur Lyman, Blacktop, Juan Garcia Esquivel, Dinah Shore, Daniel Barenboim, Palmyra and Levita with João Donato, and John Klein and Sid Ramin.

Styled after classical Western animation, it is a musical fantasy based on the fairy tale of the same name with the screenplay by Shūji Hirami, music organization by Yū Aku and songs and score composed and arranged by Takashi Miki with Shun'ichi Tokura and Tadao Inōe.The original, Japanese-language version film itself. It was released in Japan on July 20, 1974 and in the United States by Columbia Pictures in 1976. Plot Jack resides with his mother in a small house out in the country. Being very poor, they eventually find themselves forced to sell their cow, which has stopped giving milk. Jack runs into a mysterious man on the way into town and trades the cow for a handful of \\"magic\\" beans. Jack's mother becomes angry at him and spanks him with a broom before throwing the beans out the window. As Jack sleeps, the beanstalk grows, much to the astonishment of Jack's dog, Crosby. Crosby is even more surprised to see a mouse in a dress descending the beanstalk. Jack awakens and is also amazed at the sight of the beanstalk. The mouse convinces Jack and Crosby to accompany her up the beanstalk. Upon arriving at the top, the trio find themselves in the courtyard of a castle, where they find a girl who appears to be in a trance looking at them. The girl, Margaret, is the princess of the castle. Her mother and father have disappeared, but she claims to be happy since she will soon be marrying her beloved prince, Tulip, who is actually a giant. Margaret introduces Jack to Tulip's mother, Madame Hecuba, who herself is actually an evil witch that has put the princess under a spell. The witch aspires to become queen of the Land of the Clouds when Tulip and Margaret are married. Madame Hecuba takes Jack to an upstairs dining hall, where she feeds him some soup intended to put him to sleep. She has to hide him quickly when Tulip, who is not very bright, arrives upstairs. As he is eating, Tulip smells Jack's presence. Jack manages to escape, much to the chagrin of Hecuba, who orders Tulip to find him and promises to share Jack with him. In the meantime, Jack meets more clothed mice as well as a talking harp. The harp initially starts calling for the giant, but is quick to cooperate when the mice and Jack persuade her that it would be in her best interest. She reveals that Madame Hecuba got rid of the king and queen and turned the people of the castle into mice. Tulip comes into the treasure room and Jack witnesses a golden hen lay a golden egg. The harp also reveals that the witch's spell must be renewed daily. Jack decides to grab the hen and as much treasure as he can carry and make his way back down the beanstalk. In the process, he tricks Tulip into thinking he fell to his doom. Jack and his mother celebrate their new-found fortune until Crosby persuades Jack that he should stop the princess from marrying the giant. With fresh determination to help the princess, Jack ascends the beanstalk a second time. He learns from the harp that the spell over the princess can be broken with a kiss from someone who is truly brave. Jack crashes the mock wedding and gives Margaret a kiss. The witch and the giant are both angered when Margaret returns to normal and recognizes them for who they are. A chase ensues, and Jack eventually faces Madame Hecuba again. Tulip enters the room and prepares to step on Jack when, at the last moment, he turns on his mother and steps on her instead. With the witch destroyed, the mice turn back into people and the castle starts to return to normal. The giant is still around, however, and chases Jack and Crosby. The two eventually climb down the beanstalk with Tulip in hot pursuit, and cut the beanstalk down upon reaching the bottom, causing Tulip to fall to his death. Sometime later, Jack and Crosby look up to the clouds, thinking about their friends in the sky.

Henry Herx wrote in his Family Guide to Movies on Video: \\"Its songs are insipid and the animation rather primitive[;] still it moves along at a lively enough pace and may amuse younger children.\\" Richard Eder of The New York Times remarked: \\"The lines are blurry, the colors muddy, and the action is blocklike. When the characters' lips move up and down, the words come out sideways.\\" He ended his short review with this comment: \\"It is the kind of thing grandfathers are sent out to send their grandchildren to. They will sit silently, side by side, and a quiet loathing will come up between them.\\" In 2010, Michael R. Pitts said that the songs are \\"forgettable\\". Conversely, the writers of Jerry Beck's Animated Movie Guide hailed it as \\"A successful Japanese emulation of American fairy tale theatrical cartoon features with many delightful songs\\", and gave it four stars.

Poley is particularly noted for his central role in uncovering the so-called Babington plot to assassinate the Queen in 1586, and for being a witness of, and even a possible party to, the reported killing in self-defence by Ingram Frizer of the famous poet/dramatist Christopher Marlowe in May 1593. Early life There is no known record of Poley's birth and early education, the first information being his matriculation as a lowly sizar at Cambridge University's Clare College in the Michaelmas trimester of 1568. Although there was a fairly wide range, the typical age at matriculation was about 17 which would suggest that he was born in the early 1550s. He didn't go on to take a degree which could indicate that he was in fact a Catholic, as was certainly the cover he adopted later. After his spell at university, nothing is known of his whereabouts or occupation until the early 1580s, apparently with large sums of money at his disposal. In 1582 he married someone referred to as \\"Watson's daughter\\", by whom he had a daughter, Anne, who was baptised on 21 April 1583. At around this time, he started a campaign to work for Sir Francis Walsingham as a Catholic informer, the only result of which seems to have been his imprisonment in the Marshalsea on Walsingham's orders until May the next year. During this imprisonment he refused to see his wife, but regularly entertained a married woman called Joan Yeomans to \\"many fine banquets\\" there. Early career Following his release he continued his attempts to find employment in the government's service, both with Sir Francis Walsingham (via Walsingham's young relative Thomas Walsingham) and with the Earl of Leicester. The latter approach seems to have met with some success, since in June 1585 he was working with Christopher Blount (possibly a relative of Poley's?) under Leicester's aegis. He was sent as a 'special messenger' – in other words a Catholic sympathiser – to Paris to contact Thomas Morgan, one of the main conspirators working on behalf of Mary, Queen of Scots, and to deliver a letter from Blount. He returned around 10 July. In late 1585 Poley was placed, apparently by Blount, with Sir Philip Sidney who had recently married Sir Francis Walsingham's daughter Frances and, as a part of the marriage settlement, was living in Sir Francis's house in Seething Lane. This meant that Poley (whether it was planned or not) could claim to have regular access to Sir Francis without there being any suspicion that he was actually working for him. On 18 January 1586 Morgan wrote that Poley \\"is placed with the Lady Sidney, the daughter of Secretary Walsingham, & by that means ordinarily in his house\\". When Sir Philip left England to fight in the Netherlands in November 1585, Poley remained behind with Frances, and remained there until Sir Philip's death in October 1586, nearly a year later. In January 1586 he was actually asked to organise the delivery of a packet of letters to Mary, Queen of Scots. Apparently fully trusted by the Catholics, Poley nevertheless delivered the details to Walsingham. In March/April that year he was also able to reveal thoughts of plot to kill Leicester to the Earl himself, and wrote back on Leicester's behalf to discover the details. The Babington Plot In June 1586 Poley's cover as a Catholic sympathiser in Sir Francis's household was still working as he was asked to help obtain passports from Walsingham for Sir Anthony Babington and his fellow-conspirator Thomas Salisbury. From then on Poley became Babington's \\"servant and companion\\" and was often seen in his company despite doubts about Poley's trustworthiness being expressed by some Catholics. In the first two weeks of August, the conspiracy came to its fateful conclusion. On 2 June the conspirators had met and dined \\"in Poley's garden\\", the house having actually been requisitioned by the government from a Queen's Messenger, Anthony Hall. Babington found Poley copying some of his papers, but Poley was able to talk his way out of it. On the following day, Poley briefed Sir Francis and on 4 June passed messages from him back to Thomas Walsingham, who seems to have been the case officer. Although the conspirators fled they were all caught. In his cover as one of them Poley was committed to the Tower on 18 August, \\"charged to have dealt treacherously\\", but the Catholics weren't fooled. Anthony Babington, who was executed on 20 September, feared that it was Poley who had betrayed him, but he could never bring himself fully to accept it. After his arrest Babington sent Poley a letter saying \\"Farewell sweet Robyn, if as I take thee, true to me. If not adieu, omnius bipedum nequissimus [of all two-footed creatures the vilest].\\" Babington also asked him to return a diamond ring. Poley spent the next two years imprisoned in the Tower of London, during which time Sir Philip Sidney died from wounds he had received at Zutphen in the Netherlands, and Mary Queen of Scots was tried and executed. He was released late in 1588, having nevertheless kept in touch with both Blount and Walsingham during his incarceration. Messenger of the Court His cover as a Catholic agent now blown, Poley moved into a more administrative role in Walsingham's service, apparently acting as more of a case officer and messenger. He was credited with creating complex ciphers in order to deliver his messages without fear of interception. Records of payments to him between December 1588 and September 1601 show travel with important and secret documents to and from Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Scotland for members of the Privy Council. Sir Francis died in 1590, but payments continued to be made to Poley mainly by the Vice- Chamberlain, Sir Thomas Heneage or the Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, until Heneage's death in October 1595, and after that mainly by Burghley's son Sir Robert Cecil. The killing of Christopher Marlowe It was in the course of one of these trips that the killing of Christopher Marlowe occurred in the house of a widow, Eleanor Bull, in Deptford. Poley had left England on 8 May 1593 with messages for The Hague. The warrant for his payment, dated 12 June, tells us that he had delivered the reply to the court at Nonsuch Palace on 8 June and that he had been \\"in her Majesty's service all the aforesaid time.\\" In 1925, however, Leslie Hotson discovered details of the inquest on the death of Christopher Marlowe, the famous poet/dramatist, at which Poley was one of the three witnesses. The report itself tells us that Ingram Frizer killed Marlowe in self-defence, by stabbing him over the right eye in a scuffle started by Marlowe in a dispute over payment of the bill (the \\"reckoning\\") for the room and board provided for them. Poley and another man, former government agent Nicholas Skeres, were sitting on either side of Frizer when Marlowe allegedly attacked him from behind. Although some biographers still accept the story told at the inquest as a true account,For example and the majority nowadays find it hard to believe, and suggest that it was a deliberate murder, even though there is little agreement as to just who was behind it or their motive for such a course of action.See, for example, , , , , , , and – all of whom offer different explanations. The Marlovian theory even argues that the most logical reason for those people to have been there at that time was to fake Marlowe's death, allowing him to escape almost certain trial and execution for his seditious atheism. Why, after the inquest, there was a week's delay before Poley delivered to the Privy Council the replies to the letters concerning \\"special and secret affairs of great importance\\" he had carried, is one of the several mysteries concerning this event. Later career For the next eight years Poley was fairly regularly employed by the Privy Council either as a messenger, agent provocateur or spy. It was presumably in one of the latter two categories that in September 1593 he was arrested and imprisoned in the Netherlands accused of activities \\"amounting to treason\\", but after a couple of weeks he was released without charge. There was another probably much longer period of imprisonment for him in the Summer of 1597, when it seems that he was placed in the Marshalsea to spy on the playwright Ben Jonson whose play, The Isle of Dogs, written with Thomas Nashe had upset the authorities. Jonson attacked Poley and a second informer, named Parrot, as \\"damned villains\\" and later wrote a poem praising convivial company without spies, including the line \\"we shall have no Poley or Parrot by\\". The last payment known to have been received by Poley was 5 September 1601, when he was paid £10, by Sir Robert Cecil, for carrying post from and to Paris. This is the last heard of him except for a letter he wrote to Cecil on 18 July the following year. He sends information concerning Jesuits and their means of entering the country, but also indicates that his relationship with Cecil is now rather strained, saying, \\"How, half offended, you said to me I never made you good intelligence, nor did you service worth reckoning, is the cause I have not since presented myself with offer of my duty, although I much desire my endeavours might please you, my necessities needing your favour.\\"See . A transcript of this letter, together with the information sent with it, is viewable at British History Online, accessed 20 January 2012. The place and date of his death is unknown.

The lingam appears white in colour and is believed to have derived the colour from the milk poured by Kamadenu. Legend behind the temple Lord Parvathi wanted to play with a ball. Lord Shiva collated the four vedas as a ball for his consort. To avoid interference, Parvathi disallowed sunset. This resulted in natural calamity leading to the fury of Shiva and kicked away the ball to obscurity. The lord cursed parvathi to become a cow and ordered her to worship him in the place where the ball was floated under kondrai tree.

Vatapi Ganapati, the other Ganesha icon, was installed in a smaller shrine at a later date. Names and legend The Shiva temple was known as Siruthonda Ganapatishvara, named over Siruthondar. The name \\"Ganapatishvara\\", which also gives the town his alternate name \\"Ganapatishvaram\\", denotes Shiva as \\"Lord of Ganesha\\" and alludes to the legend that Ganesha killed a demon called Gajamukhasura and then worshipped his father Shiva here.Ayyar p. 402 According to another legend, A king ruling Rameswaram region prayed to Lord Shiva for child boon and performed a yajna. Through His voice, Lord assured the king that Ambica would be his daughter. When the king set out on hunting, he found four female children, brought up them as his own daughters. When they attained age, king got married them to Lord Shiva.

As per oral tradition, the icon of Vatapi Ganapati was brought booty from the Chalukyan capital of Vatapi (presently known as Badami in northern Karnataka) by Paranjothi, the commander-in-chief of the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I (reign: 630–668 CE), following the conquest of Pallavas over the Chalukyas (642 CE). The icon was placed in Paranjothi's birthplace Tiruchenkattankudi. Later, Paranjothi renounced his violent ways and became a Shaiva monk known as Siruthondar, is venerated as a Nayanar saint today.Catlin in Brown pp. 146, 150 However, no written records substantiate the oral tradition; the Ganesha icon is missing from list of war booty brought by the Pallava general.

The regiment is separate from and has no connection with the 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment which served in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and is also separate from the 3rd Regiment, Arkansas State Troops, which participated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Organization In September 1864, the remnants of several Arkansas Regiments captured at the Siege of Vicksburg or Port Hudson and later exchanged were consolidated in the Trans-Mississippi Department. There is some evidence that this consolidation may have occurred as a field consolidation as early as May 1864. The 3rd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry was created by combining the following depleted regiments: * 15th (Gee/Johnson) Arkansas Infantry Regiment. * 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, (Dockery's) * 20th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. Col. H.G.P. Williams was selected to command the new consolidated regiment. On September 30, 1864 the 3rd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry was assigned to Brigadier General Evander McNair's 2nd (Arkansas) Brigade, Acting Major General Thomas J. Churchill’s 1st (Arkansas) Division, Major General John B. Magruder’s Second Army Corps, Army of the Trans- Mississippi and remained in that assignment through December 31, 1864.United States.

On 17 November 1864, a union spy reported that the McNair's Brigade and Churhill's Division was in the vicinity of Camden, in Ouachita County, Arkansas. On 31 December 1864, General Kirby Smith's report on the organization of his forces lists the regiment, under the command of Colonel H.G.P.

MA thesis, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 2003, Page 36 Surrender This regiment was surrendered with the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, General Kirby Smith commanding, May 26, 1865. When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (war- ravaged Arkansas no longer able to subsist the army). The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering. A company or two managed to keep together until they got home. For example, Company G, 35th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, traveled back to Van Buren, Arkansas where they surrendered to the U.S. post commander in a formal ceremony, drawn up in front of the court-house, laying down their weapons, etc. But for the most part, the men simply went home. Many of the Arkansas Cavalry units, which had largely been furloughed for the winter of 1864-1865 following Price's disastrous Missouri Expedition did formally surrender at Jacksonport, Wittsburg, and a few other locations.Howerton, Bryan, \\"Re: 17th/1st/35th/22nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment.\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 26 October 2011, Accessed 26 October 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=24907 See also * List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units * Lists of American Civil War Regiments by State * Confederate Units by State * Arkansas in the American Civil War * Arkansas Militia in the Civil War References Category:Arkansas Confederate Civil War regiments Category:1865 disestablishments in Arkansas Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1865 Category:Military units and formations in Arkansas Category:Military in Arkansas Category:1861 establishments in Arkansas Category:Military units and formations established in 1861 ","title":"3rd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"32547011","text":"Pukeashun Mountain is a peak in the Monashee Range in British Columbia, Canada.

Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963), is a 6-to-3 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the reservation of jurisdiction by a federal district court did not bar the U.S. Supreme Court from reviewing a state court's ruling, and also overturned certain laws enacted by the state of Virginia in 1956 as part of the Stanley Plan and massive resistance, as violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.. The statutes here stricken down by the Supreme Court (and one overturned by the Virginia Supreme Court after the 1959 remand in Harrison v. NAACP) had expanded the definitions of the traditional common law crimes of champerty and maintenance, as well as barratry, and had been targeted at the NAACP and its civil rights litigation. Background After the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, especially the 1955 decision known as Brown II,. which ordered federal courts to enforce the 1954 decision \\"with all deliberate speed\\", U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd declared a policy of Massive Resistance to desegregation of Virginia's schools. Meanwhile, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was filing legal challenges to segregation in various Virginia schools. Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County had been filed in 1951, and became a companion case decided along with Brown. In January 1956, Virginia voters called for a limited state constitutional convention to allow tuition grants, which could be used at segregation academies and thus undercut the desegregation required by Brown. That constitutional convention was held in March 1956. On September 29, 1956, the Virginia General Assembly met in a special session and passed more than two dozen statutes concerning segregation and the schools, which Governor Thomas B. Stanley soon signed into law and which became known as the \\"Stanley Plan.\\" Some concerned tuition grants. Seven of the new statutes concerned NAACP practices in Virginia, and of those, five regulated lawyers: expanding the definitions of the common law legal ethical violations called barratry, champerty, maintenance, running and capping.\\"School, NAACP Bills Signed by Gov. Stanley.\\" Washington Post. September 30, 1956. Barratry is the \\"stirring up\\" of litigation by inducing individuals or organizations to sue when they otherwise would not.Dickson, Del, The Supreme Court in Conference, 1940-1985: The Private Discussions Behind Nearly 300 Supreme Court Decisions (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001) at p. 314 Champerty occurs when a third party (not the plaintiff or nor their legal counsel) assumes the risks and financial costs of a lawsuit in return for a portion of the monetary award.Dickson, p. 314. Maintenance occurs when a third party supports or promotes a litigant's suit to prolong litigation when the parties would otherwise have brought an end to litigation or settled the suit. The bills were specifically aimed at curbing the NAACP, which many segregationists believed was \\"stirring up\\" integration lawsuits against the Commonwealth.\\"Bills Aimed at NAACP Stir Va. Assembly Fight.\\" Washington Post. September 11, 1956. By 1956, the NAACP had filed fifteen desegregation petitions with local school boards.Brian J. Daugherity, Keep on Keeping On (Charlottesville, University of Virginia Press, 2016) p. 46. The new laws also collectively required annual filing of financial reports and membership lists for any group that promotes or opposes state legislation aimed at (1) any race, (2) any organization attempting to influence public opinion on behalf of any race, or (3) any group raising funds to employ legal counsel in connection with racial litigation. Virginia's legislature also established two new legislative committees composed of lawyer members of both houses, which investigated NAACP practices both in light of and using the new statutes. One chaired by John B. Boatwright became known as the \\"Boatwright Committee\\"; another chaired by Byrd's son-in-law James M. Thomson became known as the \\"Thomson Committee\\". This was similar to the approach taken by several other southern states, decided as Sheldon v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1958) (overturning Arkansas laws requiring public schoolteachers to disclose every organization to which they belonged or made donations to during the previous five years; and prohibiting NAACP members from holding any state job), NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958)(overturning an Alabama attorney general Patterson's attempt to enjoin all NAACP activities in the state) and Louisiana ex rel. Gremillion v. NAACP, 366 U.S. 293 (1961) (overturning Louisiana's attempt to prevent NAACP from doing business in the state). The Virginia NAACP soon filed suit in federal court in 1956 against the five new legal ethics laws, and also supported Quaker printer David Scull when he was subjected to aggressive testimony by the Thomson Committee. Both cases reached the U.S. Supreme Court around the same time, and were argued after January 19, 1959 (Robert E. Lee's birthday, a holiday in Virginia), when both a three-judge federal panel in James v. Almond and the Virginia Supreme Court in Harrison v. Day invalidated many other provisions of the Stanley Plan. Then on May 4, 1959, the Supreme Court unanimously threw out the contempt conviction the Thomson Committee had obtained in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities. The case that ultimately became this one had been filed by the NAACP against the Attorney General of Virginia (first James Lindsay Almond Jr. then when he resigned to run for governor his interim successor Kenneth Cartwright Patty, and later other successors), to have the five barratry, champerty, maintenance, running and capping laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of its members' rights under the 1st Amendment to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.Dickson, p. 315. The district court overturned three of the laws on constitutional grounds, and remanded the remaining two to state courts. The newly elected Attorney General, Albertis S. Harrison, Jr., appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, although he delegated the case to outside counsel David J. Mays who argued it on March 23 and 24, 1959, with future justice Thurgood Marshall arguing on behalf of the NAACP. In Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167 (June 8, 1959), the U.S. Supreme Court accepted Mays' arguments and held that the federal district court should have abstained from deciding the laws' constitutionality until state courts had had a reasonable chance to construe them. The NAACP then pursued its suit in state court, suing Harrison and later substituting his successors as Virginia Attorney General (initially Frederick Gray then Robert Button, since Harrison resigned to run for Governor, and was elected on the Democratic ticket with Button), in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond to have the two remaining statutes overturned on constitutional grounds. During the three day trial, the NAACP (represented by Robert L. Carter of New York and Oliver W. Hill of Richmond) called its Executive Secretary W. Lester Banks to establish the harms the new provisions had caused, as membership dropped significantly even though the NAACP refused to disclose its membership lists as required by the new laws. Attorneys representing Virginia's attorney general questioned several Virginia attorneys who handled NAACP cases, as well as more than a dozen plaintiffs in such actions. Meanwhile, in February 1960, the NAACP and other organizations began sit-ins to support desegregation. The Virginia State Bar, following the reports of the Boatwright committee, also initiated disbarment proceedings against NAACP attorney Samuel W. Tucker in Emporia, Virginia based on the expanded laws. The NAACP brought in attorney Robert Ming from Chicago to defend Tucker, and after two years of litigation, state judges dismissed the charges against Tucker in early 1962. This did, however, keep desegregation progress slow. By the fall of 1960, NAACP litigation had resulted in some desegregation in eleven localities, and the number of at least partially desegregated districts had slowly risen to 20 in the fall of 1961, 29 in the fall of 1962, and 55 (out of 130 school districts) in 1963 (only 3,700 black pupils or 1.6% attended school with whites even in 1963).Daugherity p. 99 However, the Richmond court refused to declare the new attorney discipline laws unconstitutional.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 418. The NAACP appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which upheld one statute but not the other. The NAACP appealed again to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. While Mays (who had argued the case previously before the U.S. and Virginia Supreme Courts) supervised the brief and attended the oral arguments (Robert L. Carter arguing for the NAACP), due to time constraints Mays let Wickham handle what turned out to be two arguments.James R. Sweeney (ed.) Race Reason and Massive Resistance: The Diary of David J. Mays, 1954-1959 (University of Georgia Press 1959) indicates that Mays thought the Supreme Court would strike down the laws. The book does not contain excerpts from the years in which this case was briefed and argued, but the Historical Society of Virginia library does have Mays's voluminous diary from those years. The case was argued on November 8, 1961 and reargued on October 9, 1962, due to the resignation of two justices (Charles E. Whittaker and Felix Frankfurter) and their replacement (after a Senate confirmation process) by Byron White and Arthur Goldberg. Both resigned justices were in the majority in Harrison v. NAACP; both new justices were in the majority in this decision. Ruling The opinion was issued on January 14, 1963. Majority Associate Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote the decision for the majority, and was joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Associate Justices Hugo Black and Arthur Goldberg. Associate Justice William O. Douglas concurred in the decision, but wrote an opinion expressing further views on the subject. For Brennan, the first issue before the court was a procedural one. In Harrison v. NAACP, the Supreme Court had ordered the district court to remand the case back to the state courts for disposition. However, the district court was to still maintain jurisdiction over the issue. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the NAACP could appeal the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals' ruling directly to the U.S Supreme Court, or was the NAACP required to go through the federal district court again? Brennan held that although the federal district court had reserved jurisdiction, this did not impinge on the Supreme Court's authority to review a supreme state court's decision.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 427-428. Having asserted the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the matter, Brennan now turned to the constitutional issues. The Commonwealth of Virginia argued that it was not regulating the free speech of individual lawyers and citizens, but rather that of a corporation (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), and that the U.S. Constitution did not protect the free speech rights of corporations as strongly as it did that of people. Brennan disagreed: Corporations, he said, not only have rights equal to that of individuals, but a corporation may also assert free speech and free assembly rights on behalf of its members.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 428. The nature of these free speech rights in particular, Brennan said, were not limited to \\"abstract discussion\\", but included lawful advocacy against government intrusion on this and other rights.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 429. Litigation, too, he said, was protected. Litigation was not merely a mechanism for resolving differences between two private parties but a constitutionally protected form of political expression.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 429-430. Furthermore, litigation is constitutionally protected because it is one of the few lawful means by which equal protection of the laws can be enforced. The state of Virginia had argued that organizational activity (collecting membership dues, hiring attorneys, advocating lawsuits, etc.) of the kind the NAACP engaged in was not literally a speech act, a petition for redress of grievances, or assembly of the kind mentioned in the First Amendment. But Brennan and the majority disagreed, concluding that Court precedent clearly establishes that this kind of lawful activity is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 430-431. Relying on the authoritative construction of the acts by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, Brennan noted that merely telling another individual that their rights have been violated and referring that person to an attorney or group of attorneys became a crime under the five statutes.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 434. This chilled the lawyers' and individual's First Amendment rights, and made the individual's ability to enforce its Fourteenth Amendment rights difficult, both of which were unconstitutional:NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 437. \\"There thus inheres in the statute the gravest danger of smothering all discussion looking to the eventual institution of litigation on behalf of the rights of members of an unpopular minority.\\" The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals had asserted that government had an interest in ensuring high professional standards in the legal community, and that it was not the state's intent to restrict freedom of expression. Brennan said this was no defense, for only the most compelling of governmental interests justifies an imposition on freedom of speech—and Court precedent had long established that a state's interest in prohibiting professional misconduct did not constitute a compelling interest.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 438-439. Virginia does have a governmental interest in regulating the practice of law, Brennan said, because litigation can be malicious: It can abuse the legal system for personal gain, it can be used to oppress others, and lay people can urge the use of the legal system for their own personal financial gain.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 440-441. But \\"the exercise ... of First Amendment rights to enforce constitutional rights through litigation, as a matter of law, cannot be deemed malicious.\\"NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 440. Yet First Amendment litigation is exactly the sort of activity the Virginia laws sought to bar.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 442-444. Furthermore, Virginia could not show at trial any substantive evil flowing from the NAACP's activities.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 444. The judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals was reversed.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 445. Douglas' concurrence Associate Justice Douglas concurred in the Court's ruling. He addressed the dissent by pointing out that not only the laws' legislative history, but both the district court and the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals clearly found that the legislature passed them to discriminate against the NAACP and to circumvent the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 445-446. \\"[T]hey make clear the purpose of the present law — ... to evade our prior decisions... The fact that the contrivance used is subtle and indirect is not material to the question.\\"NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 446. White's concurrence and dissent  Associate Justice Byron White concurred in the Court's judgment, but dissented from its reasoning. White thought that the five Virginia legal business laws unconstitutionally infringed on freedom of speech and the constitutionally protected lawful exercise of the court system to ensure the full exercise of those rights.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 447. A more narrowly drawn statute, White felt, may have passed constitutional scrutiny, but the majority's decision appeared unable to admit such an outcome.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 447-448. White would not have discussed the maliciousness of the NAACP's activities, as that issue was not properly before the Court.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 448. Harlan's dissent Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II, who had written the majority opinion in Harrison v. NAACP, now wrote the dissent, joined only by Associate Justices Tom C. Clark and Potter Stewart. Harlan argued that the record before the Court clearly showed that the lawyers working for the NAACP were members of the organization's legal staff, that NAACP policy and officers controlled the lawyers' actions, and that the NAACP did not merely represent clients who came to it but instead actively sought out very specific types of clients to advance its policy agenda. Thus the dissenters thought that the \\"normal\\" attorney-client relationship was often not present in the NAACP's relationships with its legal clients.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 448-451. The dissenters thought the NAACP had violated not only the five new legal business laws, but also similar laws adopted more than 20 years earlier.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 451. Harlan noted that the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals construed the five new legal business laws as not prohibiting the constitutional exercise of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and thought that should be determinative.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 451-452. The dissenters denied that litigation enjoyed strong constitutional protection, because it was only \\"associated\\" with freedom of expression, and the Virginia statutes only incidentally infringed on this speech.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 453-454. Furthermore, Harlan considered litigation conduct, which does not enjoy the same strong constitutional protection as speech.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 454. Harlan also disagreed with the majority's characterization of the NAACP's activities as free from financial gain, calling it not a typical (and protected) attorney-client relationship because the NAACP and its clients lacked enough common interests to avoid maliciousness.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 456-463. The dissenters argued that the Court had never allowed before allowed constitutional lawsuits avoid the rules of evidence, regulation of the law, legal ethics, or other state interests.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 463-465. Harlan chided the majority for labeling the Virginia statutes vague and overbroad, arguing that neither the trial record nor the state courts' construction of the statutes had found the laws vague.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 465-467. Since Harlan would have upheld the statutes despite the First Amendment challenges, he thought the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process of law and equal protection of the law not infringed.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. at 469-470. Consequences The next year, the Supreme Court heard and decided Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar. Virginia's attempt to use its professional responsibility regulations to curtail union practices was again curtailed in another opinion authored by Justice Black, over the dissents of Justices Clark and Harlan. Justice Stewart did not participate in the Trainmen decision. The NAACP v. Button decision, which approved the NAACP's \\"test case\\" strategy, also led to the growth of public interest law firms with other goals, such as less restrictive housing of the mentally ill, and even contesting the No Child Left Behind Act. However, those later class action cases also raised possible ethical problems of lawyers placing ideological motivations above actual client interests. The American Bar Association later adopted Model Rule of Professional Conduct 6.1 (applicable to lawyers working without charging clients) to distinguish those solicitations from others that violate legal ethics guidelines, although Justice Thurgood Marshall criticized that approach as benefiting primarily white establishment attorneys who could afford to work without pay, rather than increasing diversity within the bar, as NAACP practices had. Thus, in Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,436 U.S. 447 (1978),. the Supreme Court distinguished inappropriate for-profit client solicitations from the protected political speech in Button and the ACLU attorney in In re Primus, whom it found South Carolina improperly prosecuted for offering legal services for free to a woman who was involuntarily sterilized.Nicole M.

It closed in 1891. Origins In 1819, Rowland Hill moved his father's Hill Top School from central Birmingham, establishing a new school called Hazelwood at Edgbaston, an affluent suburb, as an \\"educational refraction of Priestley's ideas\\".W. H. G. Armytage, 'The Lunar Society and its Contribution to Education', in University of Birmingham Historical Journal vol. 67 (1967-68)P. W. J. Bartrip, 'A Thoroughly Good School: an Examination of the Hazelwood Experiment in Progressive Education' in British Journal of Educational Studies, vol. 28 (1980), pp. 46–59 Hazelwood soon became a model for the education of the new middle classes, aiming to give sufficient knowledge and skills to enable a boy to continue self-education throughout a life \\"most useful to society and most happy to himself\\".Elie Halévy, The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism (1972) pp. 153-4 The new school, which Hill designed himself, had both a science laboratory and a swimming pool. In his Plans for the Government and Liberal Instruction of Boys, Hill argued that kindness, instead of corporal punishment, and moral influence, rather than fear, should be to the fore in school discipline. Science should be a compulsory subject, and boys were to be self-governing. Hazelwood School gained international attention when Marc Antoine Jullien visited the school and wrote about it in the issue of Revue encyclopédique for June 1823, then sent his own son there. Foundation A 19th-century extension built for the school Hazelwood so impressed Jeremy Bentham that in 1827 a branch of the school was created at Bruce Castle in Tottenham, with Rowland Hill as its head master. Unfortunately for the old school, the new one proved much more popular than the old, with boys transferring to it in large numbers, and in 1833 the original Hazelwood School closed and became a home for Francis and Caroline Clark (sister of Rowland Hill) and their large family.Brown, Robert and Martin/Clark Committee The Hatbox Letters Published by the authors, Adelaide 1999. Its educational system was continued at the new Bruce Castle School.The Durham research review: the research publication of the Institute of Education, University of Durham, Issues 11-15 (1960), pp. 75-79 History From its beginning Rowland Hill ran the school along radical lines, inspired by his friends Richard Price, Thomas Paine, and Joseph Priestley.Malcolm Dick, Joseph Priestley and his Influence on Education in Birmingham (2004) Its principle was that the role of the schoolmaster is to instill the desire to learn, more than to impart facts. There was no corporal punishment and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils. The school's curriculum included foreign languages, science and engineering.Jean Pegram, 'From Manor House... to Museum', in Haringey History Bulletin, 28 (London: Hornsey Historical Society, 1987, ), p. 10 At the time, most established schools focussed on Classics, and for a school to include engineering in its curriculum was almost unheard of. In 1829 and 1830, Hill employed Edward William Brayley to lecture on physical sciences, both at Hazelwood and at Bruce Castle.J. N. Hays, 'Brayley, Edward William (1801/2–1870)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) In the biography of one early pupil, Sir Henry Barkly (1815–1898), the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that \\"...the school's particular curriculum endowed him with a lifetime interest in science and statistics.John Benyon, 'Barkly, Sir Henry (1815–1898)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) The school taught the sons of Charles Babbage, the computing pioneer, and of many diplomats based in London, especially from the new nations of South America. One such was the son of José Rufino Echenique, a former President of Peru.Carr (1908), p. 6 \\"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\\". In 1839 Rowland Hill was appointed as head of the General Post Office, where he introduce the world's first postage stamps. He left the school in the hands of his younger brother, Arthur Hill, who continued as head master until 1868, when he was succeeded by his son Birkbeck Hill. He retired in 1877, ending his family's long connection with the school. The Rev. William Almack succeeded him. During the School's time, Tottenham's character changed. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840 made commuting to central London possible, and in 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a line from Enfield to Liverpool Street, with a station at Bruce Grove. The Bruce Castle School was in some ways a victim of its own success. As its methods were adopted elsewhere, parents returned to traditional schools which had adapted themselves to a new age. The Rev. William Almack continued to run the school until 1891, when it was closed. The Municipal Borough of Tottenham bought the house and grounds, which were opened to the public as Bruce Castle Park in June 1892. The Park is still in use, and is adjacent to Broadwater Farm. A printing press designed by Rowland Hill and built by pupils of the school is on display at London's Science Museum.

This is the first narration of a Sri Lankan female guerrilla soldier to be published as a memoir in English. It was initially written as a diary while at boarding school after the author fled Sri Lanka. The author was inspired to rewrite the book for publication after seeing the negative reaction to those fleeing from the civil war in Sri Lanka,. The book was first published by Allen & Unwin in May 2011. It is included in the 50 Books You Can't Put Down' list as part of the Get Reading programme sponsored by the Australian Ministry for the Arts and the Australia Council. It was subsequently published in the United States and India in May 2012, and in the UK in August 2012. Pen name The name Niromi de Soyza is based on that of Richard de Zoysa, a well-known Sri Lankan journalist and human rights activist who was abducted and murdered in 1990, by suspected government agents. Author At the time of publishing the work in 2011, the author of the book is the mother of two children, and living in Sydney, Australia. She was raised in Sri Lanka by a middle-class Tamil Christian family, and at the age of 17 ran away from her convent school to join the Tigers. After leaving the Tigers she was sent by her family to a boarding school in India, and then gained political asylum in Australia at a time when the Tigers were not regarded as a terrorist organisation by the Australian government. Responses Australian Media response The book received wide publicity in Australia, drawing in general sympathetic comment from Australian media personnel. Gordon Weiss,Niromi de Soyza in conversation with Gordon Weiss: Tue 5 Jul 2011 the Australian-born former UN spokesman in Sri Lanka and author of The Cage: The Fight for Sri Lanka and the Last Days of the Tamil Tigers, responded warmly to the book, saying > I found it incredibly moving, you get the perspective of a young person, > coming of age and experiencing oppression in extraordinary circumstances, > who then joins in great innocence this organisation which seems to offer so > much hope. She ultimately sees (the LTTE) as no solution and leaves, because > she doesn't want to become like them. It's really a story of redemption. A > young woman drags herself back from the precipice and literally, one day, > casts off her uniform and walks out of the forest. Reviews Gerard Windsor reviewing Tamil Tigress came to the conclusion that the form of the book is more that of a realist novel than a memoir, leading him to tell us that there must be a creative element here, although he was probably unaware that the book was first written in diary form immediately after de Soyza fled Sri Lanka. He commented that action, often pedestrian and repetitious, rather than thoughtfulness, is what moves the book forward with a mature, briskly businesslike de Soyza only entering the book in its final pages. Prof. V.Suryanarayan in the Eurasia Review calls it an absorbing account \\"which describes the best and the worst of the Tigers.\\" Publishers Weekly, in relation to the US release, describeshttp://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-7423-7518-2 the book as an engaging memoir where readers \\"will both empathize with and judge de Soyza’s experiences in the Tamil struggle.\\" The Book Review Literary Trust in India describes the memoir as deeply moving, very humane, and a \\"jaw-dropping true story.\\" A Lost Cause Under the Microscope The reviewer, M.R. Narayan Swamy, comments, \\"Indeed, I have not read another more honest and candid account of the now vanquished Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), that too from the inside,\\" stating that the book is more than just an autobiographical journey, but is a rare microscope that takes its readers into the heart of the LTTE. Historical detail The book's authenticity has been challenged by some on the grounds that it makes an error in historical detail.Michael Roberts (September 2011) Forbidden Fruits? Niromi de Soyza, Noumi Kouri and Helen Demidenko? The Island Tigressails&code;_title=33739 Part 1, Part 2 . Michael Roberts, Forbidden Fruits: Niromi de Soyza’s \\"Tamil Tigress\\", Noumi Kouri and Helen Demidenko?, Groundviews, 31 Aug 2011 They allege a misrepresentation by the author of the identity of her combat adversaries which contradicts the historical context of her claimed fighting tenure (late 1987 to 1988 according to Tamil Tigress ). From late July 1987 to early 1990, the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord and the consequent arrival of the IPKF ensured the withdrawal of the Sri Lankan troops from the Battlefield. Under the terms of the agreement,Colombo agreed to a devolution of power to the provinces, the Sri Lankan troops were to be withdrawn to their barracks in the north and the Tamil rebels were to surrender their arms.Text of the Peace accord.Tamil Nation When the LTTE was at war with the IPKF from early October, 1987 to end of 1989, not one of the three arms of the Sri Lankan forces participated in joint action with the IPKF or had any integrated command structure. The Sri Lankan forces stayed clear of direct combat with the LTTE during this period, apart from the limited operations undertaken at sea by the Sri Lankan Navy. In contrast the blurb of Tamil Tigress announces, > \\"Two days before Christmas in 1987, at the age of 17, Niromi de Soyza found > herself in an ambush as part of a small platoon of militant Tamil Tigers > fighting government forces in the bloody civil war that was to engulf Sri > Lanka for decades…\\" This is not a publisher's mistake confined to a publisher's blurb as the author herself makes specific reference to who the Tigers fought during this time. When she joined 'the Indian forces had arrived and the Tigers had chosen to fight the Indian forces as well as the Sri Lankan forces.'Margaret Throsby,With Niromi de Soyza, Thursday 21July2011 When the war resumed, 'just as Prabhakaran had predicted', they 'were fighting not only the government troops but the peacekeepers, too'. She 'put down her gun and fled the violence she'd become a part of, unable to deal any longer with the brutality of her fellow Tigers or the viciousness of the Sri Lankan armed forces'. Most of her time with the Tigers was 'spent running and hiding from government soldiers'. In her Throsby interview, responding to a question about a film - the \\"four corners documentary\\", which is a documentary covering the atrocities committed by the Sri Lankan Government Forces during the final stages of the Elam War, Niromi de Soyza makes another statement, which can be linked to this misrepresentation of the historical context of the period. > \\"I watched it. I forced myself to watch it… It distressed the whole time….I > couldn’t sleep that night… but at the same time it wasn’t new. This was > something that I knew had happened. I mean I had witnessed much of it and I > knew when… the Tamil tigers were caught by the soldiers those things would > happen …they would be shot in the head, raped, tortured all of those things. > It was nothing new.\\"-(between 35.56 and 36.23) Michael Roberts, a Sri Lankan-Australian historical anthropologistPersonhood and Suicidal Devotion to Cause: Kamikaze, Jihadist, Tiger. University Scholars Programme, 19 October 2006 who has a history of asking his readers to disbelieve Tamil accounts of the war in Sri Lanka, has interpreted this contextual misrepresentation by the author as an attempt to give the book greater contemporary currency by projecting the Sri Lankan Forces (contemporary target for war crimes allegations) into the fighting experiences attributed to Niromi de Soyza in Tamil Tigress. A review of the memoir in Ceylon Today states that while some of the arguments put forward to question its authenticity may have some veracity, they are excusable, whereas the other arguments put forward are \\"a load of nonsense.\\" The reviewer states that most of the debunking allegations are rather arbitrary and petty, and that Jaffna Tamils who have actually read the book point out that its portrayal of Jaffna life at that time is quite authentic. Sri Lankan Government response The quibbles regarding the book's authenticity would seem to be rendered irrelevant by the Sri Lankan government, who do not seem to have any reservation confirming that de Soyza was indeed a member of the LTTE, and that the claims she makes are true.Sri Lankan Government on Tamil Tigress Author's response As part of an \\"inspirational address\\" to an Australian women's business network, it was reported that while \\"Sri Lankan critics have questioned Niromi's incredible story, she stands by her memoirs.\\" When asked about the allegations of authenticity in a Q&A;, the author responded, \\"Many have dispelled these myths. I trust in the intelligence of the readers - to read the book with an open mind without agendas and to listen to my many interviews and make up their own mind.\\"  References  *  External links  *Interview with Ashley Walsh, 14 July 2011 * Writing and truth:The instance of Niromi de Soyza’s Tamil Tigress, By Charles Ponnuthurai Sarvan, the Sunday Times Plus, 25 September 2011 Category:Sri Lankan Civil War books Category:Sri Lankan diaspora Category:Memoirs Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:Allen & Unwin books ","title":"Tamil Tigress"},{"id":"32547124","text":"The Western Michigan Broncos baseball team is a varsity intercollegiate athletic team of Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States.

When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (war-ravaged Arkansas no longer able to subsist the army). The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering. A company or two managed to keep together until they got home. For example, Company G, 35th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, traveled back to Van Buren, Arkansas where they surrendered to the U.S. post commander in a formal ceremony, drawn up in front of the court-house, laying down their weapons, etc. But for the most part, the men simply went home.

There is some evidence that this consolidation may have occurred as a field consolidation as early as May 1864.

MA thesis, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 2003, Page 36  Surrender  This regiment was surrendered with the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, General Kirby Smith commanding, May 26, 1865. When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (war-ravaged Arkansas no longer able to subsist the army). The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering. A company or two managed to keep together until they got home. For example, Company G, 35th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, traveled back to Van Buren, Arkansas where they surrendered to the U.S. post commander in a formal ceremony, drawn up in front of the court-house, laying down their weapons, etc. But for the most part, the men simply went home. Many of the Arkansas Cavalry units, which had largely been furloughed for the winter of 1864-1865 following Price's disastrous Missouri Expedition did formally surrender at Jacksonport, Wittsburg, and a few other locations.Howerton, Bryan, \\"Re: 17th/1st/35th/22nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment.\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 26 October 2011, Accessed 26 October 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=24907  See also  *List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units *Lists of American Civil War Regiments by State *Confederate Units by State *Arkansas in the American Civil War *Arkansas Militia in the Civil War  References  Category:Arkansas Confederate Civil War regiments Category:1865 disestablishments in Arkansas Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1865 Category:Military units and formations in Arkansas Category:Military in Arkansas Category:1864 establishments in Arkansas Category:Military units and formations established in 1864 ","title":"2nd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"32547196","text":"Itchy Jones Stadium is a baseball venue in Carbondale, Illinois. It is home to the Southern Illinois Salukis baseball team of the NCAA Division I Missouri Valley Conference. The field, opened in 1964, holds 2,000 spectators. The field was previously named for former Southern Illinois baseball coach Abe Martin. In 2014 after a complete renovation, the venue was dedicated \\"Itchy Jones Stadium\\" after head coach Itch Jones.  History  After the field's 1964 construction, it remained undedicated until 1972. On April 30, 1972, the field was formally dedicated to Abe Martin. Martin coached Saluki baseball for 19 seasons (1946–1964) during a 33-year tenure at the university. A scoreboard was also added around the time of the dedication. In the decades after the facility's opening, several minor improvements were made. In 1966, new bleachers, believed to have been taken from Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, were added. Sportsman's, the former home of Major League Baseball's both St. Louis Cardinals and Browns, had closed earlier that year. In 1988, a clubhouse was built. 2000 renovations saw bermuda grass installed in the outfield and batting cages beyond the right field fence. In 2006, an electronic scoreboard was constructed past the right center field fence.  2011 renovations  As Martin Field entered its fifth decade of use, calls for improving the aging facility increased. The facility, called \\"Ancient Abe\\" by writer Todd Hefferman, was the oldest in use by a Missouri Valley Conference team. In 2011, plans were made to update the field. The university announced in May 2011 a fundraising campaign to renovate Abe Martin Field. Planned additions include stadium lighting, a press box, fencing, and new dugouts. A new seating structure was built, and Martin's combination rye and Bermuda grass surface was replaced by FieldTurf. Saluki head baseball coach Ken Henderson supported the effort, saying, \\"To take the next step, to take that next big step, we've gotta have that facility.\\" Computer images of the future facility were made available. On March 13, 2014, the field was officially renamed in honor of Jones. Jones was in attendance and threw out a ceremonial first pitch.

The animal sanctuary has been open to the public and BCR sells tickets to visitors for tours including private tours, night tours, and feeding tours. However, BCR closed the facility to the public on March 16, 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and Carole Baskin later announced that she was considering not reopening the animal sanctuary to the public. In 2019, BCR had 51 animals — 17 big cats and 34 small cats of 11 species including bobcat, Canada lynx, caracal, cougar, Eurasian lynx, jaguar, leopard, lion, ocelot, serval, and tiger — down from 66 in 2018. BCR has been accredited by Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries since 2009, and has received 4-star ratings from Charity Navigator for 2007–2017. History In 1992, Don Lewis and Carole Lewis (now known as Carole Baskin) acquired a bobcat. The following year they acquired dozens more. In 1995, they incorporated Wildlife on Easy Street, Inc. in Florida as a Not For Profit Corporation with the stated purpose of \\"acquisition, shelter, feeding, breeding and socialization of exotic and non-exotic animals; public education and awareness to benefit their wild counterparts.\\" In 2003, Wildlife on Easy Street, Inc. was dissolved in a merger into a newly incorporated nonprofit, Big Cat Rescue Corp., with the stated purpose \\"Prevention of cruelty to animals by providing rescue and a permanent retirement home to exotic cats\\". The sanctuary featured a bed and breakfast experience that allowed guests to spend the night with a young wild cat in their cabin. According to the sanctuary, this part of its history was a misguided effort to aid captive conservation and animal welfare of privately owned animals. The sanctuary was accredited by The Association of Sanctuaries in 1998, and its successor, the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries since 2007 to present. In September 2000, Wildlife on Easy Street applied to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for accreditation as a Certified Related Facility. The application was denied in March 2001 for various reasons, including concerns about the amount of visitor contact with the cats, lack of any trained zoological professionals on staff, insufficient formal veterinary programs and unfinished perimeter fencing. BCR ceased physical encounters of any kind between the public and cats housed there in 2003. In 2013, following a 2011 lawsuit, Joseph Maldonado-Passage, aka \\"Joe Exotic\\", whose family runs the GW Exotic Animal Park, was ordered to pay Big Cat Rescue $ for using confusingly similar trademarked materials. Joe Exotic attempted to hire a hitman to kill Carole Baskin, Chief Executive Officer of Big Cat Rescue, who had won a lawsuit against him in 2013. Maldonado-Passage has since been arrested and convicted of two counts of murder-for-hire, eight violations of the Lacey Act and nine of the Endangered Species Act. In October 2014, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission inspected BCR based on a complaint and issued a warning for \\"maintaining a Leopard in an uncovered outdoor cage >1000 sq. ft., without the use of a moat system, and without previously obtaining written approval by the Commission\\". In March 2019, Big Cat Rescue opened a zoo exhibit without live animals, using augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. Visitors come in person and access the exhibit through a mobile app on their cell phone. In March 2020, Big Cat Rescue temporarily closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic in Florida. Conservation Tiger at Big Cat Rescue in 2012. One of the stated main goals of Big Cat Rescue is to end ownership and trade of exotic felines in the private sector entirely. Big Cat Rescue claims that permit systems are not effective at ensuring animal welfare and campaigns for a total ban of private ownership of big cats regardless of keeping conditions. The center is part of the International Tiger Coalition, which is dedicated to stopping the trade of tiger parts. In 2005, Big Cat Rescue published an action plan to end all captive keeping of all exotic cats, including animals in AZA-accredited zoos bred for conservation. According to the plan, Big Cat Rescue wanted interstate transport of big cats for any reason (including conservation breeding programs) to end by 2012, display of large exotic cats in zoos to end by 2013 and keeping of any exotic cats (including smaller species) in zoos to be discontinued by 2015. In 2015, Big Cat Rescue began campaigning for the passage of a bill in the United States Congress called The Big Cat Public Safety Act (H.R. 3546) that would ban all future keeping of all large cat species in the United States, with zoos certified by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, as well as certain sanctuaries, universities, wildlife rehabilitators, and traveling circuses being exempt. In 2019 the Big Cat Public Safety Act was revised to end cub handling, the primary cause of abuse and phase out private ownership of big cats, while allowing possession by USDA licensees. As of January 2020, HR1380 has 227 co-sponsors in the House and the companion bill, S2561 has 17 co-sponsors in the Senate. Rescue of Skip In January 2011, the center received attention for its rescue of \\"Skip\\", a bobcat, who had likely been hit by a car on Florida State Road 46 and had a crushed pelvis. Fans of Skip who watched his recovery on Ustream organized on Facebook, calling themselves \\"Skipaholics\\". These fans contributed money for cameras, cat beds, and other equipment, but Skip died in September 2012.

The documentary is hosted by historian Manuel Vicuña and the actor Francisco Melo, reprising the roles of Felipe Pigna and Mario Pergolini in the Argentine documentary. The documentary was based on investigations by Andrea Larroucau, Juan Carlos Arellano, Jorge Martin, Carolina Odone and María José Schneuer, and the support of Hernán Rodríguez, Alejandra Araya and Fernando Purcell.Televisión Nacional presenta serie dominical: “Algo habrán hecho por la Historia de Chile” The documentary narrates the history of Chile, from the Spanish colonization by Pedro de Valdivia and the begin of the Arauco War, to the Centennial of Chile in 1910. In the interim, the documentary deals with the Chilean War of Independence, the Chilean civil wars, the War of the Confederation, the War of the Pacific, among others. The documentary uses two main styles, jumping from one to the other. One style is the use of actors to represent certain key events. The second style is the plain explanation of the things taking place, which could be done with visual gags, with the hosts in some modern day location, or at a representation of an event. The use of jokes or visual gags, however, is very limited, and the documentary does not have the humoristic tone of the Argentine one; and the acted passages are longer and more detailed.

It was created by John Clarke and Andrew Knight and starred Terry Bader, Richard Healy, Debra Lawrance and Peter Hosking. According to Debra Lawrance on The Conversation Hour in ABC 774 radio 15 October 2015 (at about 26 mins into the file), the ABC taped over the master Umatic tapes.  Plot Overview  This comedy series follows two private investigators, Bryce (Terry Bader) and Ken (Richard Healy), who run a firm known as the \\"Excelsior Research Foundation\\". They are assisted by Pat (Debra Lawrance), their receptionist. Bryce thinks he is smart and boasts about his elite private school background, but is actually very stupid and fails to understand what is really happening around him. He dropped out of law school in the second year. Ken is the down-to-earth blue- collar member of the team, but they both usually get into deep trouble. Pat is the sensible and smart one, but the others don't recognise this. She and Detective Sergeant Blair (Peter Hosking) usually rescue them and clean up after them. The plots are a black comedy and satire. The agency is desperate for work and usually takes on small cases involving simple detective work (e.g. domestic disputes). Bryce and Ken stumble around trying to solve it - mostly when Bryce takes the obviously wrong approach - and getting deeper into trouble. Meanwhile Pat does the real detective work and uncovers a bigger crime that is linked to the small case (e.g. corporate crime). Although Pat discovers the real criminals, they often escape prosecution because of loopholes in the law or they are too powerful to touch. In the end, the simple case is wrapped up and Bryce undeservedly takes the credit for it. But the audience and Pat realise the injustice, because the wrapup usually results in the innocent becoming the victim and the real criminals getting way with it.

Design  The Stevens and early Savages models have one trigger and an exposed hammer, with a barrel selector on the right side of the receiver (up for the rifle barrel and down for the shotgun barrel) and no manual safety. Later models had the selector on the top of the exposed hammer (forward/down for shotgun barrel and back/up for the rifle barrel) with a cross-bolt hammer- block safety through the receiver.

These guns were manufactured between 1977 and 1981.\\"A Brief History of the Savage-Stevens 22-410 Over and Under\\" by Marshall Williams Like all later Model 24s, it uses a single trigger and single exposed hammer with a barrel selector lever incorporated into the hammer. It also has a checkered stock and a shotgun bead sight.  Savage Model 42  The Savage Model 42 combo-gun was introduced in 2012, as the successor to the Model 24.\\"New from Savage: Model 42 Combination\\" by Chris Dumm. January 18, 2012. The Model 42s barrels are 20 inches long, and the upper barrel fires .22 LR or .22 Magnum, while the lower barrel fires .410 gauge shells. It features black plastic furniture and the adjustable rifle sights can be removed to install a scope base. In 2016, Savage Arms introduced the Model 42 \\"Takedown\\" model which breaks down with the push of one button.\\"Savage Model 42 Takedown: Gun Review\\"  Savage Model 2400  The Savage Model 2400 was made by Valmet of Finland and imported by Savage from 1975 to 1980.

Iambus depicted the ugly and unheroic side of humanity. Iambus or iambic poetry was a genre of ancient Greek poetry that included but was not restricted to the iambic meter and whose origins modern scholars have traced to the cults of Demeter and Dionysus. The genre featured insulting and obscene languageChristopher Brown, in A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets, D.E.Gerber (ed), Leiden 1997, pages 13–88Douglas E. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, Loeb Classical Library (1999), Introduction pages i–iv and sometimes it is referred to as \\"blame poetry\\".D. Mankin, Horace: Epodes,C.U.P., 8 For Alexandrian editors, however, iambus signified any poetry of an informal kind that was intended to entertain, and it seems to have been performed on similar occasions as elegy even though lacking elegy's decorum.J.P. Barron and P.E. Easterling, \\"Elegy and Iambus\\" in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature, P.Easterling and B.Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 120 The Archaic Greek poets Archilochus, Semonides and Hipponax were among the most famous of its early exponents. The Alexandrian poet Callimachus composed \\"iambic\\" poems against contemporary scholars, which were collected in an edition of about a thousand lines, of which fragments of thirteen poems survive.A.W. Bulloch, \\"Hellenistic Poetry\\", in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature, P.Easterling and B.Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), pages 556–57, 569 He in turn influenced Roman poets such as Catullus, who composed satirical epigrams that popularized Hipponax's choliamb.Peter Green, The Poems of Catullus, University of California Press (2005), pages 10, 33 Horace's Epodes on the other hand were mainly imitations of ArchilochusE. Fraenkel, Horace, Sandpiper Books Ltd, 32 and, as with the Greek poet, his invectives took the forms both of private revenge and denunciation of social offenders.J.P. Clancy, The Odes and Epodes of Horace, Chicago (1960), page 196V.G. Kiernan, Horace: Poetics and Politics, New York (1999), page 52 Historical background Originally \\"iambos\\" () denoted a type of poetry, specifically its content, and only secondarily did it have any significance as a metrical term. This emerges for example from the fact that Archilochus, a famous iambic poet, was once criticized for being \\"too iambic\\"The phrase \\"too iambic\\" appears in a fragmentary inscription dated to the third century BC, originally part of a commemorative shrine to Archilochus, \\"The Archilocheion\\". The inscription was a part of a record of his life and reception on Paros, where his poetry was deemed offensive by the population until Dionyssus opened their eyes to their own folly by punishing them with some kind of affliction, possibly impotence (the fragment is very patchy at that point). A Pythian oracle then advised them to honour Archilochus and thus a shrine was established to him. (see Archilochus fr. 3 and commentary, D.E. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 16–25 The genre appears to have originated in the cult of Demeter, whose festivals commonly featured insulting and abusive language (, aischrologia). A figure called \\"Iambe\\" is even mentioned in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, employing language so abusive that the goddess forgets her sorrows and laughs instead. The abuse of a divinity however is quite common in other cults too, as an ironic means of affirming piety: \\"Normality is reinforced by experiencing its opposite\\".C. Brown in A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets, 41 The common element in all iambus is blame, drawing attention to dangerous or unsuitable behaviours. It is addressed to an audience with shared values and customs, which are represented as under threat, as for example a body of citizens or companions. Whatever its real composition, the audience is cast in the role of mutual friends and their friendship (, philotēs or Latin amicitia) is asserted in various ways: *the poet, speaking in his own person, might criticize someone directly, whether a group member or an outsider; *the poet might act out the role of someone guilty of misconduct, condemning \\"himself\\" in his own words; *the poet might tell a story, combining 'self-indictments' with a narrative account of misconduct. Blame ranges from humorous ribbing of friends to merciless attacks on outsiders.D. Mankin, Horace: Epodes, 8–9 Among ancient literary theorists, iambic verse came to be regarded as lower than lyric poetry, partly because iambic meter was thought to be the simplest of verse forms, and the nearest to common speech, but also because of its undignified content.S. Harrison, Lyric and Iambic, 190 It isn't clear what role Archilochus played in the development of the literary genre at the beginning of the seventh century. Demeter was a significant deity in his home island, Paros, but she isn't prominent in his surviving poetry. Possibly he became involved in iambus via the cult of Dionysus. This cult's association with iambus seems to be indicated etymologically by the poetic form associated with Dionysus, the dithyramb, a term which appears to include the same root as \\"iambus\\". Early dithyrambs were a \\"riotous affair\\"D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 2–3 and Archilochus was prominent in the controversial development of Dionyssian worship on ParosD. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, 138 (possibly in relation to phallic rites).D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 3 There is no sure evidence about the original venue for iambic poetry but the drinking party (or symposium) and the cult festival were probably the main occasions.D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 4 Nor do we know clearly what role iambic poetry played in ancient society. It was certainly complex. It seems to have found voice during times of social change and political dissent, when the poet felt entitled or empowered to preach and condemn.L. O'Higgins, Women and Humour in Classical Greece, 63 Semonides, probably about the middle of the seventh century, composed iambic verse on a misogynist theme, but without the invective and obscenity of Archilochus.D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 7–8 A hundred years after Archilochus, Hipponax was composing choliambs, a deliberately awkward version of the iambic trimeter symbolizing mankind's imperfections and vices,P. Green, The Poems of Catullus, 10, 33 yet by then iambus seems to have been performed mainly for entertainment (our understanding of his work however might change significantly when and as more fragments are unearthed).D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 2 The genre's religious and moral value was evidently not appreciated by the fifth century lyric poet Pindar, who condemned Archilochus for being \\"sharp-tongued\\" and \\"grown fat on the harsh words of hate\\",Pindar, Pythian II, translated by Geoffrey Conway, The Odes of Pindar, 93 yet Archilochus's brand of iambus could still find sympathetic audiences even in the first century AD, when the philosopher, Dio Chrysostom, compared him with Homer in these terms: The spread of literacy impacted on all ancient poetry, iambus included. Its influence was already becoming evident in Athens by the fifth century BC, gradually changing the nature of poetry from a performance before a local group to a literary artifact with an international reach.E. Fraenkel, Horace, 41 By the Hellenistic period, the librarian/scholar Callimachus claimed to be following the example of Hipponax yet introduced a wider range of content and a more literary and intellectual focus. He also aligned iambus more closely with other genresS. Harrison, Lyric and Iambic, 190 such as curse poetry (Ἀραί) and farewell poetry (propemptika, ).E. Fraenkel, Horace, 35 Iambus was taken up as a political weapon by some public figures in Rome, such as Cato The Elder, who, in an account by Plutarch: Neoteric poets such as Catullus combined a native tradition of satirical epigram with Hipponax's pungent invective to form neatly crafted, personal attacks. Hipponactean choliambs were among Catullus's most often used metersP. Green, The Poems of Catullus, 10, 33 but the spirit of iambus seems to have infused much of his non-iambic verse as well.S. Harrison, Lyric and Iambic, 192 Horace nominally modelled his Epodes on the work of Archilochus but he mainly followed the example of Callimachus, relying on painstaking craftsmanship rather than instinctive vitriolE. Fraenkel, Horace, 32 and broadening the range of the genre. Thus for example he introduced a panagyric element in support of Augustus (Epodes 1 and 9), a lyrical element (Epode 13), and a suggestion of love poetry (Epodes 11 and 14). Moreover, his iambic persona is deliberately presented as powerless, in contrast to the swaggering persona of Archilochus.S. Harrison, Lyric and Iambic, 192–94 Horace's weak iambic persona is not inconsistent with the genre. Traditionally the iambic poet, though he bullies others, is a victim too. Thus Archilochus was said to have driven his would-be in-laws to suicide by his invectives after they had cheated him out of a promised marriage, and Hipponax was said to have driven Bupalus to suicide after being caricatured by him in a sculpture. Similarly the author of the Strasbourg fragment below is motivated by revenge. Moreover, Horace's thematic variety is not without parallel among archaic poets such as Archilochus and Hipponax: the mood of the genre is meant to appear spontaneous and that inevitably led to some \\"hodepodge\\" contexts.L. Watson, The Epodes: Horace's Archilochus?, 99 Whatever his unique contribution may have been, Horace still managed to recreate something of the ancient spirit of the genre, alerting his companions to threats facing them as a group, in this case as Roman citizens of a doomed republic: A tale of two ditties The nature of iambus changed from one epoch to another, as becomes obvious if we compare two poems that are otherwise very similarHorace's Epode 10 (around 30 BC) and the \\"Strasbourg\\" papyrus, a fragment attributed either to Archilochus or Hipponax (seventh and sixth century respectively). The modern world became aware of the Greek poem only in 1899, when it was discovered by R. Reitzenstein among other papyri at the University Library of Strasbourg. He published it straight away, recognizing its significance and its resemblance to Horace's poem. This study however begins with Horace and it is based on comments by Eduard Fraenkel.E. Fraenkel, Horace, 25–35 Epode 10 Horace's poem is in couplets, where a line of iambic trimeter (six iambic feet) is followed by a line of iambic dimeter (four iambic feet). Here it is broken into four-line stanzas to bring out the intrinsic structure of the poem. The English translation has the same metrical couplets but the rhythm is accentual (the norm for English verse) rather than quantitative (the norm for classical Latin and Greek verse). {style=\\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\\"  width=\\"400px\\"  width=\\"400px\\" - border=\\"0\\" |- Valign=top et agna Tempestatibus. Epode 10 from D. Mankin, Horace: Epodes, 38-9 The ship casts off from shore in an ill-omened hour, Carrying the stinking Mevius. God of the southern windtake care to pulverize Both its sides with horrendous waves! Let the black eastern wind turn the sea upside-down, Some oars here, some rigging there, And may the north wind loom as large as when it rends Oaks trembling on the mountain tops, And not one friendly star appear through the dark night As Orion sinks in the west! May the sea carrying him be no more gentle than The waves the winning Greeks sailed on That time Athena turned her rage from smouldering Troy Onto Ajax and his damned ship! Oh what a cold damp sweating will beset your crew While you change hue to a pale green, And oh how woman-like will all that wailing be And all those prayers ignored by Jove, When the Ionian sea, resounding with the wet Southern wind, breaks apart your ship! If then the rich spoil, scattered round the curving shore, Lies at the pleasure of the gulls, There will be sacrifices of a lusty goat And lamb in honour of the Winds. |} It is not known who Mevius is nor what he is supposed to have done wrong. The name could be of a real person but it could also function like \\"John Doe\\" and thus it might be a stock figure with some special significance for the original audience. Some scholars identify him with the Maevius rubbished as a contemptible poet by Virgil in Eclogues 3.90 but there is no proof for such an identification. He could represent an imaginary scapegoat intended to avert the gods' anger from the poet's circle of 'friends', a device common in the archaic iambus of Hipponax and Archilochus: in this case, the \\"friends\\" may be understood to be Roman citizens at a time of social and political decay.D. Mankin, Horace: Epodes, 183–4 A fictional Mevius would also be consistent with iambus as a mere literary topic, where Horace makes up for the lack of any real context by adding artistic values, in the Hellenistic manner.E. Fraenkel, Horace, 42 The poem is skilfully structured. There is an introduction briefly outlining the situation (lines 1–2), a large midsection made up of curses (lines 3–14) and predictions (15–20), and finally an epilogue (21–24). Three winds (Auster, Eurus, Aquilo) are the chief figures in the main body of the poem and also at the very end (Tempestates). Each wind is assigned its own couplet (lines 3–8), but only the south wind is addressed. The south wind gets another mention, though by a different name, 'Notus' (line 20), so that these two mentions provide the poem with the kind of symmetry found in Ring composition. By the latter part of the poem, however, the south wind is no longer being addressed, a change that happens when Mevius is addressed instead (lines 15–20). This change in addressee is preceded by a mythological episode taken from the heroic Ajax legend, occurring exactly in the middle of the poem (lines 11–14), where it functions as a sort of piano nobile, with curses before and predictions afterwards. In some versions of the poem, Mevius continues to be addressed right to the very end, i.e. iuverit has been taken to be iuveris instead (line 22). Some scholars prefer iuveris since it implies that only Mevius ends up as rich spoil for the gulls, but other scholars argue that it is quite consistent with iambus for the whole crew to be punished on account of one offender, a result implied by the impersonal ending iuverit in the version here. Moreover, the impersonal ending marks a clear break between the epilogue and the main body of the poem.E. Fraenkel, Horace, 32–3 The intricate structure of the poem reveals Hellenistic influence. A poet of the archaic period, such as Archilochus or Hipponax, might have mentioned this or that wind but not arranged them as neatly as here, assigning each its own couplet. Moreover, the epode bears resemblance to curse poems or , fashionable in the Hellenistic period. On the other hand, Horace leaves out the heavy- handed pedantry of a craftsman like Callimachus. The epode also resembles a \\"farewell\\" poem or but with an ironic inversion: in a Hellenistic \\"farewell\\" poem, it was conventional to wish upon the traveller a safe voyage and favourable winds, pledging sacrifices if the ship arrived at port. Nevertheless, the ironic genre-bending quality of epode 10 (and some others in the collection) was fairly typical of Hellenistic poetry generally. The \\"serious struggle\\" is found in the Strasbourg fragment. Strasbourg papyrus Reitzenstein, the first editor of the fragment, attributed it to Archilochus but, in the following year (1900) Friedrich Blass assigned it to Hipponax. The papyrus includes, among its tattered portions, an incomplete name (, Hippona..), which seems to support Blass's identification since Hipponax often mentions himself by name in his extant work. However the brilliance of the poem's invective suggests it is the work of a more significant poet i.e. Archilochus.D. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, 157 Some scholars conclude that the fragment is not a single poem, assigning part to Archilochus and the rest to Hipponax.D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 437 Like Horace's epode above, the verse below is made of couplets, but the meter is a bit different. An initial line of iambic trimeter in this case is followed by a hemiepes (two dactyls then an emphatic final syllable). The English translation follows it closely but in accentual rhythm. The opening lines are lost and the square brackets indicate another lost portion. The square brackets are not in the English version, replaced by an \\"educated guess\\" suggested by Eduard Fraenkel. A few more letters were lost in the original but scholars are in general agreement about their identity and those gaps are not shown here. The comments are also largely based on Fraenkel's work.E. Fraenkel, Horace, 28–9 Despite all the gaps in the original, the fragment supplies a key meaning absent from Horace's epodea motive for hate. {style=\\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\\"  width=\\"400px\\"  width=\\"400px\\" - border=\\"0\\" |- Valign=top ..... Strasburg papyrus, D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 436-438 .... Drifting about in the swell; When he comes nude to Salmydessus, may the kind Thracians, their hair in a bun, Take him in handthere he shall have his fill of woe, Slavishly eating his bread Stiff with the freezing cold; emerging from the froth, Clung to by piles of seaweed, May he lie like a dog face-down on chattering teeth, Laid low by his feebleness, Sprawled at the breakers' edge, still licked at by the surf! These are the things I must see, Because he wronged me, trampling all over our oaths, Once a companion of mine! |} The language is vigorous and direct, appropriate to the mood of the piece. Some of the diction is borrowed from the older work of Homer but it adds dignity and pathos without any artificiality. Meanings flow clearly and naturally with the simple meter, except in one place, marked with a \\"parenthesis\\" or endash, where emotions get ahead of the poet's control as he anticipates years of suffering for his former friend. Images seem to tumble from his excited mind but nothing is superfluous and his control of the material is shown for example in his use of irony when referring to the great kindness of the savage Thracians, their hair neatly dressed, in contrast to his nude friend.E. Fraenkel, Horace, 28–9 His skill as a wordsmith can be seen in the way he loads the beginnings of lines with key words, a trend he overturns in the final couplet, with a caesura, marked by a comma, between key words justifying his hatred, (\\"wronged me, trampling\\").D. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, 157 One of the uncertainties in the text comes in the word , which indicates that the seaweed has a hold on the castaway. Some scholars prefer to read , indicating that he spews out seaweed.The variant reading is cited for instance by D. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, 438 Scholars often contrast the poem's realism with the artificiality of Horace's Epode 10, but not all scholars are willing to go along with this view, citing the Homeric diction as a literary device and the absence of proof that the oath-breaker was ever a real man rather than just a scapegoat or imaginary exemplar.D. Mankin, Horace: Epodes, 182 Yet the poet has made the context seem real.

(Page 760) Structure As opposed to his previous music, which models itself on the Roman style of baroque composition best exemplified by Arcangelo Corelli, the concerti of L'arte del violino were created in the newer Venetian style of Antonio Vivaldi. The music makes ample use of the violin's very high register, giving it a bel canto quality lacking in Locatelli's early work.Roeder, Michael T. A History of the Concerto. Portland, OR: Amadeus Press, 1994. (Page 105). Each of the twelve concertos in L'arte del violino contained the traditional three movements, with the typical progression of two faster movements surrounding a slower, more contemplative middle movement. In each concerto, the two outer movements contain what is known as a capriccio. These capricci, often lasting several minutes, can be described as a kind of written-out violin cadenza played extemporaneously during which the soloist is given ample opportunity to display his or her skill with the instrument. The capricci intervals contradict the expected format of the solo concerto by occurring before the final ritornello of the tutti. It is these 24 extraordinary capricci intervals for which L'arte del violino attained its fame, for they are described as \\"the most difficult violin display passages of all Baroque literature.\\"White, Chappell. From Vivaldi to Viotti: a history of the early classical violin concerto. Langhorne, PA: Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, 1994. (Page 9). The final concerto of the twelve, nicknamed the \\"Labyrinth\\" concerto by the composer, is notorious for its exceedingly difficult capricci. Locatelli wrote the following inscription beneath the first-movement capriccio: \\"Laberinto armonico: 'Facilis aditus; difficilis exitus.'\\" This can be translated to mean, \\"Harmonic Labyrinth: Easy to enter; difficult to escape!\\" In a letter dated April 11, 1741, Benjamin Tate, an English visitor, expressed his astonishment after listening to Locatelli play from the Labyrinth Concerto: Outline of concertos and movements *Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 3/1 *# Andante *# Largo *# Andante *Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 3/2 *# Andante *# Largo *# Andante *Concerto No. 3 in F major, Op. 3/3 *# Andante *# Largo *# Vivace *Concerto No. 4 in E major, Op. 3/4 *# Largo – Andante *# Largo *# Andante *Concerto No. 5 in C major, Op. 3/5 *# Largo *# Adagio *# Allegro *Concerto No. 6 in G minor, Op. 3/6 *# Largo – Andante *# Adagio *# Vivace *Concerto No. 7 in B flat major, Op. 3/7 *# Andante *# Largo *# Allegro *Concerto No. 8 in E minor, Op. 3/8 *# Andante *# Largo *# Allegro *Concerto No. 9 in G major, Op. 3/9 *# Allegro *# Largo *# Allegro *Concerto No. 10 in F major, Op. 3/10 *# Allegro *# Largo – Andante *# Andante *Concerto No. 11 in A major, Op. 3/11 *# Allegro *# Largo *# Andante *Concerto No. 12 in D major: Il Laberinto Armonico, facilus aditus, difficilis exitus, Op. 3/12 *# Allegro *# Largo *# Allegro  References   External links  * Full free score for violin solo part of L'arte del violino Category:1733 compositions Category:Compositions by Pietro Locatelli ","title":"L'arte del violino"},{"id":"32547576","text":"Timothy Dale Cruickshank (born 19 May 1982) is a New South Wales cricketer.

It is native to the Willamette Valley and Coast Range of Oregon and the southwestern corner of Washington in the United States. It is threatened by the destruction and degradation of its habitat, and it is a federally listed threatened species of the United States. This plant is a perennial herb producing several erect stems up to a meter tall from a thick taproot. The blades of the leaves are variable in shape. In general, the basal leaves are palmate in shape and the upper leaves are more deeply divided. Each stem can bear up to 100 pink flowers in a spikelike raceme. The species is gynodioecious, producing bisexual flowers and female flowers that lack the ability to produce pollen. Each flower has a purple-tinged calyx of sepals and five petals up to 1.5 centimeters in length. The fruit is a schizocarp with one seed in each of its seven to nine segments. Blooming occurs in late May through mid-July. The plants reproduce sexually via seed and vegetatively by sprouting from broken-off pieces of the root. This plant can be found in a number of wetland habitat types and is not limited to a specific kind. It grows in wet open habitat such as sedge and grass meadows and the transition zone from prairie to woodland. It can grow on sunny forest edges and in riparian habitat and it is tolerant of disturbance, occurring even near campgrounds. There are six main population centers, four in the Willamette Valley and one each in the Coast Range and southwestern Washington State. The latter is made up of two populations. A large population is present in William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge. The largest population in the Oregon Coast Range is located at Walker Flat in Yamhill County. Most populations are small. About 48% of them contain fewer than 100 plants and 31% contain under 25. This plant faces a number of threats. Fire suppression is a main threat because the habitat becomes overgrown with thick vegetation in the absence of the normal fire regime that maintains open clearings. Wildfires are beneficial for this plant, because they clear the large and woody vegetation that prevent sunlight from reaching it. Despite the plant's tolerance of disturbance, populations occurring near roads and cultivated fields are vulnerable. Many populations in the Willamette Valley are threatened or already extirpated by agricultural and urban development. Over the last 150 years 99% of the wetland habitat in the Willamette Valley has been altered or destroyed. The possible future construction of a dam threatens a large population. Even in protected areas the plant is threatened by the invasion of non-native plant species. Such weeds include reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea). Other threats include herbicides and predation by the weevil Macrohoptus sidalceae. This checkerbloom is known to hybridize with its Sidalcea relatives, such as Sidalcea cusickii, a process that can lead to genetic pollution of the rare plant.

At the outbreak of War in 1914 he enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps and attained the rank of captain by the time he was severely gassed in 1917.

Dubiously reliable source, however it does cite many specific news articles. having rented a corrugated iron shed in Sawbridgeworth with a 14-year-old lad as assistant.  From small beginnings  While in Sawbridgeworth, Cosby married Josephine Collins, the daughter of a local doctor. In the 1920s Cosby was frustrated by poor quality lathes available and resolved to produce his own design for a cheap but effective production lathe with pneumatically actuated headstock and tailstock and its own electric drive. In 1929 he was trading as Smallpeice Ltd, and moved the company to Foleshill Rd, Coventry where he shared premises with Cromwell Engineering. The collaboration allowed the production in 1929 of the Smallpeice Multicut production lathe. There was also a precision lathe marketed under the Cromwell name, and Smallpeice continued in the development of pneumatic aids to production, and apart from premises in Mile Lane in Coventry he had a drawing office in the village of Marton.  War Years  Production lathes were obviously of key importance in the war years, however on 14 November 1940 the Smallpeice and Cromwell factories in Coventry were completely destroyed by a large air-raid. Production of the Multicut lathe was resumed by a relationship with Alfred Herbert Ltd, as the Herbert-Smallpeice Lathe. While, in the village of Marton, work continued on pneumatic devices, and the company Martonair was formed. A new product, the Martonair pneumatic hoist, found a strong market in wartime factories due to the large proportion of women involved in production. In 1941 the head office was moved to a disused dance hall in Parkshot near Richmond, Surrey. While Martonair thrived, Cosby was working on a new precision lathe, something now in short supply. The design was put out to tender in December 1944, and the first lathe was produced for Smallpeice Ltd by J Evans & Sons of Portsmouth in October 1945 (though at the time they were in Frome, where they had been relocated during the war). Post-war The new Smallpeice lathe was advertised as the Cromwell S.S. & S.C. 3.5\\" x 19\\" Super-Precision Model S.800. At £448 in 1947, it was a very expensive lathe, and was built to very high-standards with many novel features,http://www.lathes.co.uk/cromwell/index.html including a Ward Leonard drive system to allow precise control of speed. A total of 350 of these precision lathes were produced by J Evans up to about 1955,Portsmouth Records Office, J.Evans Company Records, Portsmouth and J Evans were also involved in the production of some post-war Multicut lathes. Martonair continued very successfully with pneumatic systems, and built a new factory in Feltham, Middlesex. In 1966 the company was floated on the stock market, allowing Cosby to found The Smallpeice Trust, and to retire and enjoy his sailing yacht.

Meals has been a full-time MLB umpire since 1998 after serving as an MLB reserve umpire from 1992 to 1997. He worked in the 2008 NLCS between Philadelphia and Los Angeles and the All-Star Game in 2002 and 2015. He has also worked in nine Division Series (1999, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2019, 2020) and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Early life and career Meals was a 1979 graduate of Salem High School, where he played second base and briefly competed on the wrestling team. After umpiring local baseball for four years, Meals graduated from the Joe Brinkman Umpire School in 1983. At age 21, Meals received his first minor league umpiring assignment in the Class A Appalachian League. By 1985, Meals had moved to the South Atlantic League, where he was partnered with 20-year-old future MLB umpire Wally Bell. While working in the Southern League in 1989, Meals was featured in an ESPN documentary on minor league umpires. His family and fellow umpires Chris Jaksa and Fieldin Culbreth also appeared in the film. Meals worked in Triple-A baseball (Triple-A Alliance and the International League) from 1990 to 1997 before receiving a full-time promotion to the major leagues. Meals spent the 2014 season as an interim crew chief while regular crew chief Gary Darling was on the Disabled List. Meals was officially promoted to permanent crew chief upon Darling's retirement. Notable games In his first full-time MLB season, Meals was the home plate umpire when Kerry Wood tied a major league record with 20 strikeouts in a 1998 game. Meals was struck in the mask by a Wood fastball on his first pitch of the game, but the umpire was not injured. On May 7, 2011, Meals worked behind the plate for Justin Verlander's second career no-hitter. The umpire's ball four call on J. P. Arencibia in the eighth inning prevented Verlander from achieving a perfect game. However, Verlander later said that he agreed with the call. In game 2 of the 2010 American League Division Series between the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays, Meals was involved in a controversial call of a checked swing by Michael Young. Replays on television appeared to show that Young had gone around on his swing, but when asked for an appeal, Meals ruled that Young had held up, and Young's at bat stayed alive. One pitch later, Young hit a 3-run home run to put Texas ahead 5-0. The Rangers won the game 6-0, and won the series 3 games to 2, ending Tampa Bay's season. Rays manager Joe Maddon came out to argue the play and was ejected from the game. Meals and Major League Baseball both acknowledged that he missed a call in the 19th inning of a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Atlanta Braves on July 26, 2011. With respect to length of time, the game was the longest in Pirates history.Salem grad and umpire Meals says he missed call in Pittsburgh loss During the play in question, a ground ball, Pirates catcher Michael McKenry received a throw and appeared to tag Braves runner Julio Lugo three feet in front of home plate but Meals called him safe and the Braves won the game. Meals received criticism for the call and the Pirates issued a public complaint.Pirates issue statement: Jerry Meals “got this one wrong” MLB executive vice president for baseball operations Joe Torre responded to the complaint and officially acknowledged that Meals' call was an error.\\"MLB acknowledges blown call, The Associated Press (via ESPN.com), July 28, 2011.

Meals in April 2014 On Saturday, September 8, 2012, Meals incorrectly ruled Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees out on a game-ending double play at first base against the Baltimore Orioles. If Meals had made the correct call, the game would have been tied, but instead the Orioles won and moved up a game to be even with the Yankees for first in the AL East. On Monday, July 29, 2013, Meals incorrectly ruled Daniel Nava of the Boston Red Sox out at home plate in the 8th inning against the Tampa Bay Rays which would have tied the game. Instead, the Rays held on to win 2-1. Red Sox manager John Farrell was ejected for arguing the call, which Meals later admitted was incorrect.http://nesn.com/2013/07/jerry- meals-admits-to-blowing-call-at-home-plate-says-daniel-nava-should-have-been- safe/ On April 22, 2014, Meals was the home plate umpire when Albert Pujols of the Los Angeles Angels hit his 500th career home run against the Washington Nationals. On April 3, 2017, Meals was home plate umpire for Opening Day when the Washington Nationals faced the Miami Marlins.

It was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the Drosophila Trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste' proteins, from which the acronym SET is derived [Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax].  Structure  The SET domain appears generally as one part of a larger multidomain protein, and recently there were described three structures of very different proteins with distinct domain compositions: *Neurospora crassa DIM-5, a member of the Su(var) family of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) which methylate histone H3 on lysine 9, *human SET7 (also called SET9), which methylates H3 on lysine 4 *garden pea Rubisco LSMT, an enzyme that does not modify histones, but instead methylates lysine 14 in the flexible tail of the large subunit of the enzyme Rubisco. The SET domain itself turned out to be an uncommon structure. Although in all three studies, electron density maps revealed the location of the AdoMet or AdoHcy cofactor, the SET domain bears no similarity at all to the canonical/AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold. Strictly conserved in the C-terminal motif of the SET domain tyrosine could be involved in abstracting a proton from the protonated amino group of the substrate lysine, promoting its nucleophilic attack on the sulphonium methyl group of the AdoMet cofactor. In contrast to the AdoMet- dependent protein methyltranferases of the classical type, which tend to bind their polypeptide substrates on top of the cofactor, it is noted from the Rubisco LSMT structure that the AdoMet seems to bind in a separate cleft, suggesting how a polypeptide substrate could be subjected to multiple rounds of methylation without having to be released from the enzyme. In contrast, SET7/9 is able to add only a single methyl group to its substrate.  Function  It has been demonstrated that association of SET domain and myotubularin- related proteins modulates growth control. The SET domain-containing Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly) protein, enhancer of zeste, has a function in segment determination and the mammalian homologue may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription and chromatin structure. Histone lysine methylation is part of the histone code that regulates chromatin function and epigenetic control of gene function. Histone lysine methyltransferases (HMTase) differ both in their substrate specificity for the various acceptor lysines as well as in their product specificity for the number of methyl groups (one, two, or three) they transfer. With just one exception, the HMTases belong to SET family that can be classified according to the sequences surrounding the SET domain. Structural studies on the human SET7/9, a mono- methylase, have revealed the molecular basis for the specificity of the enzyme for the histone-target and the roles of the invariant residues in the SET domain in determining the methylation specificities. Associated domains The N-terminal pre-SET domain (), as found in the SUV39 SET family, contains nine invariant cysteine residues that are grouped into two segments separated by a region of variable length. These 9 cysteines coordinate 3 zinc ions to form a triangular cluster, where each of the zinc ions is coordinated by 4 four cysteines to give a tetrahedral configuration. The function of this domain is structural, holding together 2 long segments of random coils. The C-terminal region including the post-SET domain () is disordered when not interacting with a histone tail and in the absence of zinc. The three conserved cysteines in the post-SET domain form a zinc-binding site when coupled to a fourth conserved cysteine in the knot-like structure close to the SET domain active site. The structured post-SET region brings in the C-terminal residues that participate in S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding and histone tail interactions. The three conserved cysteine residues are essential for HMTase activity, as replacement with serine abolishes HMTase activity.  Examples  Human genes encoding proteins containing this domain include: * ASH1L, also has an associated with SET domain (AWS) * BAT8 * EHMT1, EHMT2, EZH1, EZH2 * FP13812 * MLL, MLL2, MLL3, MLL5 * NSD1 * PRDM1, PRDM2, PRDM5 * SETD1A, SETD2, SETD3, SETD4, SETD5, SETD6, SETD7, SETD8, SETDB1, SETDB2, SETMAR, SMYD1, SMYD3, SMYD4, SMYD5, SUV39H1, SUV39H2, SUV420H1, SUV420H2, * WBP7, WHSC1, WHSC1L1  References  Category:Protein families ","title":"SET domain"},{"id":"32548090","text":"Strudyna, also known as Structural Dynamics Co., Ltd, is a renowned engineering and manufacturer of Stainless Steel Tensile Components for facade structures,British Stainless steel Association, Strudyna, June 2010 with offices and fabrication facilities in the UK, Australia and Thailand, and manufacturing facilities in Thailand.PRlog.org, Strudyna, July 2011 With engineering and development practices of high tensile components for glass façade structures, building envelop and seismic induced structures, Strudyna focused on solutions aimed for full stress cycle loading structures. The tensile façade engineering leg of Strudyna and parent company Kinzi (Thailand) Co Ltd developed several pioneering solutions for well known façades, including the New Bangkok International Airport, Suntec city façade renovation Singapore and New Doha International Airport Grid H façade Qatar. Other recognizable façade structures include Shilin Sogo department store MPG façade in Taiwan, Marina Bay Sands Casino Ned Kahn Wind Arbor in Singapore, LA Live Ritz Carlton hotel Los Angeles USA and People's leasing bank HQ in Colombo Sri Lanka. The founders developed the trade name Stru-dyna from a shorthand description of the company name Stru-ctural and Dyna-mics, and choose this name as it represented the unique dynamics forces that the stainless steel products are subjected too. History After working in several International façade projects, Kinzi (Thailand) Co Ltd in Thailand and Arcus Wire Group Pty Ltd in Australia, the parent companies of Strudyna, found major flaws in the availability of Stainless Steel components available for the Structural market. Up until then, stainless steel tensile components were primarily designed for the marine industry, in particular yacht standing rigging which were hastily adapted for architecture applications, where by doing this in many cases compromised the aesthetic of the support system. Coupled with shortage of reliable tensile fabrication source, Strudyna was created in 2006 to fill this gap. Since then Strudyna's engineers have dedicated to developing commercial tensile architectural systems for glass facades, curtain walling, and fabric structures. This enabled the original Kinzi engineers to pursue R&D; of new tensile technology for major projects.Strudyna.com, History, 2011  Production and processes  Strudyna's tensile components are manufactured primarily in stainless steel grade AISI 316, A4-80, Duplex and Super Duplex.

It is found in the Mediterranean Sea and around islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where it lives below the intertidal zone. Its carapace, eyestalks and claws are marked with numerous red spots. C. tubularis and its sister species, C. verrilli, are the only hermit crabs known to show sexual dimorphism in shell choice, with males using normal marine gastropod shells, while females use shells of gastropods in the family Vermetidae, which are attached to rocks or other hard substrates. Distribution The genus Calcinus has its centre of diversity in the central Pacific Ocean, and only two species occur in the north-eastern Atlantic – Calcinus paradoxus and Calcinus tubularis. C. tubularis is a chiefly Mediterranean species; its range extends from Madeira in the west to Lebanon in the east, with outlying records from Madeira, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Ascension Island. Although it is distinctively coloured, the sedentary behaviour of C. tubularis allows epibionts to colonise its shells, providing excellent camouflage, and it can easily go unnoticed; it was first reported on the coast of the Portuguese mainland in 2011, but is thought to have been living there for a long time. Description The carapace of Calcinus tubularis is bluish in colour, with many red spots, and extends forwards as a short, triangular rostrum. The eyestalks are white with similar red spotting, as is the last segment of each of the walking legs, and both the fixed and movable fingers of the claws. The colour scheme exists in a dark form and a light form, which appears to be linked to camouflage, particularly for females. C. tubularis is of \\"normal size\\" for a Calcinus species, frequently exceeding a carapace width of . Ecology Calcinus tubularis is a rare species, found below the intertidal zone. It is one of only two species of hermit crab (the other being the closely related C. verrilli) in which sexual dimorphism in shell use has been observed. Males inhabit gastropod shells, chiefly those of Pisania maculosa or Cerithium vulgatum, which they can move freely; females occupy the fixed tubes made by the vermetid snail Lementina arenaria. The only parasite known to attack Calcinus tubularis is a rhizocephalan barnacle, probably of the genus Septosaccus, although it is also targeted by another barnacle, Trypetesa lampas, which is an egg predator of various hermit crabs. Taxonomy Calcinus tubularis was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1767 12th edition of his Systema Naturae, under the name Cancer tubularis. It was later described by Polydore Roux as Pagurus ornatus, and that species was transferred to the genus Calcinus in 1892 by Édouard Chevreux and Eugène Louis Bouvier. Lipke Holthuis recognised that C. ornatus was a junior synonym of Cancer tubularis, and transferred Linnaeus' species to the genus Calcinus, at which point it reached its current scientific name. The specific epithet ' refers to the animals habit of living in the tubes of vermetid molluscs. Linnaeus' description is imprecise, and could refer to \\"practically any hermit crab\\", but the type locality (the Mediterranean Sea), together with the statement that it lives in worm tubes, restricts the possibilities to this one species. Evolution The sister species of Calcinus tubularis is C. verrilli, which is endemic to Bermuda. The two species show the same sexual dimorphism in shell choice, making this an example of niche conservatism.

It is very similar to M. rubra, but has a more northerly and higher- altitude distribution. Overwintering larvae may become either workers or queen ants, with up to 20 queens living in a colony of up to 2,500 individuals. Two subspecies are recognised, differing in the relative size of the queen. Description There is a close resemblance between Myrmica ruginodis and Myrmica rubra, another common species across much of Eurasia. They differ in the shape of the base of the antennae, which are curved in M. ruginodis and sharply angled in M. rubra, and in the spines projecting from the back of the thorax – in M. ruginodis, these are as long as the distance between their tips, while in M. rubra, they are shorter. Distribution and ecology Myrmica ruginodis is found across the northern Palaearctic region, at higher altitudes and latitudes than M. rubra. Its range extends from Western Europe to Japan, and from Italy in the south to the Norwegian North Cape in the north. M. ruginodis is the only species of ant to have been recorded from all of the vice-counties into which the British Isles are divided for the purposes of biological recording, including the Channel Islands, and the only ant species present in Shetland, where it is \\"locally common\\". It is \\"very abundant\\" in European woodland and moorland, especially above an altitude of , where it replaces M. rubra. The diet of M. ruginodis usually consists of small insects and other arthropods, but may also include any carcasses of birds and mammals found while foraging. Life cycle Myrmica ruginodis overwinters as larvae. The larvae which have experienced the cold weather of a winter can develop into either workers or queens, and the specialisation into castes occurs only about a week before the end of the larval growth. A queen lays eggs throughout the spring and summer, and these larvae form two broods, with different rates of development. The fast brood develop within three months, and become workers; the slow brood take a year to develop and are the larvae which overwinter and develop into queens or workers. Each colony contains 1,200 to 2,500 individuals, including 10–20 queens. Mating flights take place in July and August. Taxonomic history Myrmica ruginodis was first described by the Finnish biologist William Nylander in 1846. It has been divided into two subspecies, based on the size of the queens. One, M. r. macrogyna, has queens significantly larger than the workers, while the other, M. r. microgyna, has queens of a similar size to the workers. M. r. microgyna has a different distribution to M. r. macrogyna (restricted to north-western Great Britain, for instance), and also differs from M. r. macrogyna in that the colonies also reproduce by \\"budding\\", while M. r. macrogyna only reproduces through mating flights.

Ten ships that were part of a convoy on its way from Jamaica to the United States and Britain wrecked on the surrounding reef. While local residents braved the stormy waters and successfully rescued the ships' crews and passengers, eight people from the convoy died. History Wreck of the Ten Sail memorial plaque and viewpoint - dedicated by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 Following the British Royal Navy's capture of the French 12-pounder frigate, l'Inconstante, off of St. Domingue, the British took charge of the ship in November 1793, renaming her . The newly christened naval frigate and her seasoned captain, John Lawford, were ordered to escort a 6-vessel merchant convoy from Jamaica to Britain. Three other vessels, bound for the United States, joined the convoy. The nine merchant ships were: , Eagle, Fortune, Ludlow, Moorhall, Nancy, Richard, Sally, and William and Elizabeth.The Maritime Heritage of the Cayman Islands, pg. 156; Roger C. Smith, 2000 - University Press of Florida After sailing for nearly 24 hours, Lawford believed they had already passed Grand Cayman Island. Before going to bed the evening of 7 February 1794, he gave permission for a change of course several points to the north, heading directly for the western end of Cuba and the Florida Channel. With most of the convoy to the south of the lead ship, six or seven merchantmen ships moved ahead of the leading ship and without attracting the attention of Convert's watch. At 3 a.m. on 8 February Lawford was called on deck following the discharge of a distress gun. With a Convert watchman yelling, \\"Breakers ahead. Close to us!\\", Lawford gave orders for the rest of the fleet to disperse, hoping to avoid disaster. A merchantman on the opposite tack, however, struck Convert twice and forced her into the windward reef, causing her to become severely damaged and eventually swamped.Texas A&M; University Department of ArchaeologyFounded Upon the Seas, pg. 57-58; Michael Crayton, 2003 - Ian Randle Publishers One vessel, Diana, Thompson, master, saw the disaster but not having any boats, could not render any assistance and so sailed on to Britain, arriving at the Downs on 16 March. An initial report appeared in Lloyd's List on 21 March. Caymanians living on the East End and in Bodden Town came to the aid of the 10 ships and rescued the crews and passengers. Despite their efforts, eight lives were lost as a result of the wreck.\\"History\\" - Cayman Islands Government websiteFounded Upon the Seas; Michael Crayton, 2003 - Ian Randle Publishers Amongst those lost was Captain Martin of Britannia, who went down with his ship.Founded Upon the Seas, pg. 59; Michael Crayton, 2003 - Ian Randle Publishers After his rescue, Captain Lawford travelled to George Town, sending a number of distress messages, one of which was to the Governor of Havana, asking for assistance with the remains of the convoy; another was sent to his commander-in-chief, Commodore John Ford. Three days after the wreck, leaders among the inhabitants of Grand Cayman informed Lawford that they were unable to continue to house and feed the numerous merchantmen and sailors. Lawford shipped off as many of the shipwrecked convoy members as he could. Among those to first leave Grand Cayman following the shipwreck were Lady Emilia Cooke and the naval and military officers who were travelling home.Founded Upon the Seas, pg. 60; Michael Crayton, 2003 - Ian Randle Publishers Within three weeks, a number of sloops and schooners arrived from Jamaica with provisions and assistance. Lawford and what was left of his crew proceeded to camp on the beach at Gun Bay. During this time, Lawford's crew attempted to rescue the guns from the submerged ships. While none of the guns were salvaged, the mail carried on Convert was saved, along with a large proportion of the cargo from all the wrecked ships. Among the cargo salvaged from the merchant ships were loads of rum, cotton, and wood. After Commodore Ford received Lawford's distress call, a rescue was sent to the shipwrecked remaining on the island. arrived at Grand Cayman in mid-March 1794, anchored only for a short time before taking Lawford and his crew back to Port Royal where he was court martialled aboard the same ship. Lawford was acquitted of all charges and went on to serve with distinction until his retirement in 1811.Founded Upon the Seas, pg. 60; Michael Crayton, 2003 - Ian Randle Publishers Legend Residents of the Cayman Islands enjoy a tax-free existence; local legend has it that the reason for the absence of taxation is related directly to the Wreck of the Ten Sail. According to the legend, a member of the passenger list for the 10 vessels included a royal prince, one of the sons of Britain’s King George III. The legend further states that when the King was apprised of the bravery on the part of the Caymanians in saving the crews and passengers of the foundering ships, he decided to repay their bravery. The reward became a decree that the people of the Cayman Islands would thereafter be free from war conscription and taxes. There is, however, no documented evidence that the decree was ever issued or that there was a member of the Royal Family on board one of the ships. Regardless, the legend continues today and is often repeated to travellers and tourists as well as amongst the residents of the Cayman Islands.Cayman Islands New Resident publication Memorial Two of the ten memorial stones embedded into ironshore cliff overlooking the Ten Sail wreck site A picture of the Wreck of the Ten Sails memorial taken from the water. Today, a park exists as a remembrance of the night of the shipwreck and the heroism of the residents who came to rescue those on-board all the ships. Beginning with the Maritime Trail that leads visitors to a view of the reef where the ships were wrecked and a cliff full of treacherous ironshore as well as brass and stone memorial to those who perished. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, visited the spot and dedicated the memorial plaque and park in 1994 - the 200th anniversary of the event. Below and beside the plaque and viewing platform on a cliff made of ironshore are ten embedded cement blocks.

It grows up to tall, with 2–4 female spikes and 1 male spike in an inflorescence. These stalks bend as the seeds ripen, and the seeds are collected and dispersed by ants of the species Myrmica ruginodis. Description Habitus The culms of Carex pilulifera grow to a length of , and are often noticeably curved. The leaves are long and wide, and are fairly flat. The rhizomes of C. pilulifera are very short, giving the plant a caespitose (densely tufted) appearance. The tussock grows outwards through the production of annual side-shoots. The inflorescence comprises a single, terminal, male (staminate) spike, and 2–4 lateral female (pistillate) spikes. The spikes are clustered together, and the whole inflorescence is long. The female spikes are long, ovoid or approaching spherical, and contains 5–15 flowers. The female spikes are attached directly to the stem, and each is subtended by a bract which does not form a sheath. The male spike is long and much narrower. Distribution and ecology Carex pilulifera has a wide distribution in Europe, extending from Macaronesia and the Balkan Peninsula to Scandinavia. It grows on acidic substrates including heathland, grassland and woodland. It typically inhabits soils with a pH of 4.5–6.0. As the seeds of C. pilulifera ripen, the culms bend, and can eventually touch the ground. The seeds are then dispersed by ants, particularly Myrmica ruginodis, in a process known as myrmecochory, and are eaten by other insects, such as the ground beetle Harpalus fuliginosus. Taxonomic history Carex pilulifera was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum, which marks the starting point of botanical nomenclature. The specific epithet ' means \\"bearing small globular structures\\", in reference to the female spikes.

Biography Maroso was born in Marostica, in the province of Vicenza. He was the brother of Pietro Maroso (1934–2012), also a Serie A player and honorary president of A.S. Varese. Club career Maroso played as a defender. After a period on loan at Alessandria (1944), he made his club debut with Torino on 14 October 1945, in a 2–1 defeat to rivals Juventus in the Turin Derby. In total, he played 103 times for Torino in league matches, scoring once, and won four consecutive Serie A (scudetti) titles between 1945 and 1949. International career At international level, he was capped seven times for the Italian national team between 1945 and 1949, scoring one goal. His debut came on 11 November 1945, in a 4–4 draw against Switzerland. Style of play A promising and highly talented player, Maroso was a precocious full-back, who is considered to be one of the best Italian players ever in his position, and is even rated by some pundits in the sport to be Italy's greatest left-back ever. A fast, powerful, elegant, and technically gifted offensive-minded left-back, who was known for his flair and touch on the ball, Maroso was one of the first ever attacking full-backs in football, and was even capable of playing as a winger due to his ability to get up the flank; although he stood out for his attacking prowess, he was also strong defensively, courtesy of his foot-work and anticipation, and was capable of playing with either foot. In addition to his playing ability, he also stood out for his correct behaviour and fair-play on the pitch, and rarely gave away fouls; despite his skill, however, he was also injury-prone. Death and legacy Maroso died with most of the Grande Torino team in the Superga air disaster near Turin, on 4 May 1949. The football stadium in his home-town of Marostica is dedicated to him.

The Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore di Siponto is a church in Manfredonia, Apulia, southern Italy. Once the city's cathedral, it received the status of Basilica Minor in 1977; it is dedicated to the Holy Virgin of Siponto (the ancient name of Manfredonia). The church was completed around 1117, when it was consecrated (perhaps in place of a pre-existing 6th century Palaeo-Christian edifice) and the relics of Laurence of Siponto where put under the high altar. Description The building has an unusual square plan, consisting of two independent churches (one, underground, is the current crypt), two apses on the southern and eastern walls, and a medieval monumental portal with two side lions, facing the road entering in Manfredonia. The interior, with four pillars, dates to the 11th century, and once housed the icon of the Holy Virgin of Siponto (Italian: Maria Santissima di Siponto), dated to the 7th century. The icon is now in the Manfredonia Cathedral, as well as the polychrome wood Byzantine statue of \\"La Sipontina\\" (6th century) The underground church dates to the early Middle Ages, and was replaced by the upper one after having been destroyed by an earthquake.

The bridge opened in 1959 and is 316 metres long and 10 metres wide. The bridge carries two lanes of traffic and a footpath. Prior to 2009 State Highway 2 and State Highway 29 ran concurrently over the bridge. Following the completion of the Harbour Link project, State Highway 2 was diverted over the Tauranga Harbour Bridge, so at the present time only State Highway 29A runs over the bridge.  History  Since the bridge has been built in 1959, there have been changes to its design. For example, in 2014, there was a project that implemented a new barrier between the bridge and the already existing one. That project took about two months and is now being redeveloped in the more recent project. The current redevelopment process has been separated into four stages. It has completed three out of the four thus far.  Present  Before the Maungatapu Bridge was undergoing construction there were many accidents happening across it. In turn, there were many complaints and worries from the citizens who drove through the bridge daily. According to citizens who have driven across it for a long period of time, the danger of the bridge had increased along with the dramatic increase of traffic. In June 2016, there was car crash involving multiple cars that injured five people in total, two of them considered to be seriously injured. The crash was so serious that the road had to be blocked off which caused a serious backup in terms of traffic flow. Just last November 2018, there was another multiple vehicle car crash that once again blocked off the roads. There were no serious injuries, but it did result in another round of complaints and worries from the citizens of there needing to be a change. These are just a few accounts of the many accidents that have happened throughout the years of the bridge's existence. As of now, the Maungatapu Bridge is under the process of construction. The Maungatapu underpass was reopened on June 22, 2018. In July 2018, the New Zealand Transport Agency set up a trial run that lasted for ten days. This trial closed off the straight through option of the bridge and allowed for people to only use the roundabout. In doing this, the hopes of those in charge of the project and the trial was to see if the new design was efficient and safe. It gave the planner a chance to gather information regarding the traffic flow and travel times of the new design. The construction consists of four stages, three of them already completed, while the remaining is still in works. The first stage dealt with the addition of street lights, the second stage was improvements to the intersections, and the third had to do with gathering data that would best help those in charge of the project in coming up with the best new design.  Future  Welcome Bay Bridge The Maungatapu Bridge is currently under construction and has been since 2008 when they had street lights added to the roundabouts as the first stage of the redevelopment design. The second stage dealt with improvements of the intersection, and the third stage dealt with finding the best solution for improvements in traffic flow and safety. That was all stated before, and now, the project is currently on its fourth stage which calls for the Maungatapu underpass to become two lanes instead of one, as well as the construction of a new bridge over the Kaitemako Stream. Part of the new design will link the Welcome Bay Road to the Hairini highway. In going through this redevelopment process, the hopes of the New Zealand Transport Agency are to ensure better traffic flow and the safety of its citizens in terms of the movement of the road and even the pedestrians. There is no information regarding the completion date for the new project.  Miscellaneous Information  Maungatapu is the name of a mountain located in New Zealand and because the bridge is located in the region where that mountain resides, it was named after it. The name comes from the language of the natives of New Zealand and it translates directly to “sacred mountain.” In 1866, this mountain became the site of the infamous Maungatapu murders. The Maungatapu murders is a series of murders of five men that was done by a gang known as the Burgess gang. In the end, one member of the gang turned him and his members in to the police due to disagreements rising within the gang. They were punished for their crimes and there is now a monument put up at the mountain site dedicated to those who were murdered as a result of the gang's doings. The Maungatapu Bridge is in the city of Tauranga, often referred to as the vacation destination. The city of Tauranga is home to Mount Maunganui which provides views of the area and activities for both the locals and tourists. Some of these activities include whale watching, swimming, surfing, rock climbing, and extreme jet boating. Tauranga is a city known for its beaches, scenery, and the area's activities.

Initially educated at home, and originally intending to become a teacher, from the age of 13 she attended the prestigious Miss Higbee's School for Young Ladies in Memphis, Tennessee.\\"The Higby School took only the best girls from the best families in Memphis — not always the first families [such as] those with places at the Cotton Exchange on Front Street … but always the most respectable families …\\" (Livingston, 2013). A change in her family's fortunes meant that a career as a teacher was no longer possible, and her family encouraged her to pursue an acting career.Miss Maud Jeffries: Success of a Talented Southern Girl: After a Triumph in England She Goes to Australia to Support Wilson Barrett, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, (Sunday, 19 December 1897), p.22.  Theatrical career  From the age of 5, Jeffries regularly entertained her family with recitations; and, once at Miss Higbee's School for Young Ladies, in addition to her elocutionary skills, she also began to display a great talent at music,Miss Higbee’s School, The Memphis Daily Appeal, (Tuesday, 10 June 1884), p.1. and at singing.\\"Braga's Trois Banquette de Marguerite was exquisitely sung by Miss Maud Jeffries, the cadences of her voice filling every ear with delight\\" (Commencements, The Memphis Daily Appeal, (Tuesday, 13 June 1885), p.4). Apparently, when offstage, Jeffries was a somewhat modest and shy person;Other exceptionally shy people in real life who have flourished on stage include Bea Arthur (1922-2009) (see Jweekly, 30 April 2009); and Ann-Margret (1941-) (see Saturday Evening Post, 4 May 1963). and, except for (perhaps, only) two occasions throughout her career — in The Memphis Daily Appeal of 9 July 1888,Stage Struck Girls, The Memphis Daily Appeal, (Monday, 9 July 1888), p.5. and The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, of 19 December 1897 — she refused to be interviewed by the press.Miss Maud Jeffries on Interviewing, The (Sydney) Sunday Times, (Sunday, 6 March 1898), p.2.  United States (1887-1890)  In October 1887, when Jeffries was just seventeen, she performed in Lizzie Evans's new play, Our Angel, at the New Memphis Theatre. Leaving Memphis on 14 August 1888 for New York,Personal, The Memphis Daily Appeal, (Wednesday, 15 August 1888), p.4. she joined the Lizzie Evans company; however, within three weeks it was reported that \\"Miss Maud Jeffries has been compelled to give up her engagement with the Lizzie Evans company and has returned home for rest and quiet\\".Movements of Prominent People, The Memphis Daily Appeal, (Sunday, 2 September 1888), p.10. — with a more detailed account emerging a week later: In 1889 she went to New York and worked with Augustin Daly's company, playing small parts in pays such as \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and \\"As You Like It\\". Whilst working with Daly's company, she attracted the attention of Wilson Barrett.  England (1890-1892)  Advertising Jeffries' English debut (4 December 1890) Jeffries left the United States on the RMS City of Chester on 6 August 1890,Through the Opera Glass: Personal and Other Jottings, The (San Francisco) Morning Call, (17 August 1890), p.11. and arrived at Liverpool on 16 August 1890. Her first appearance on the English stage was in a small part in a new play, The People's Idol, that Barrett had written in collaboration with Victor Widnell. She made her English debut, on 4 December 1890, in the play's first public performance:The opening night had been delayed due to problems with the construction of the theatre. on the opening night of The New Olympic Theatre, in London's Drury Lane, an entirely new, purpose-built theatre, which Barrett also managed. In August 1891, Wilson Barrett discovered that, due to a half forgotten arrangement made several years earlier, his leading lady at the time, \\"Maud Elmore\\",Almost certainly, the \\"Maud Elmore\\" in question was Alice Maude Mary Ann Belmore-Gastin (1844-1911), née Cooke (mother of Lionel Belmore, Paul Belmore, and Daisy Belmore), who often worked with Barrett, and was usually billed as \\"Miss Alice Cooke\\". was contracted to appear with Morris Abrahams at the Pavilion Theatre for the whole of the 1891/1892 season.Theatrical Gossip, The Era, (Saturday, 29 August 1891), p.8.According to Thomas (1984, p.109), another actress, Mary Eastlake (1856-1911) who had been with Barrett for nine years, and had also been his \\"leading lady\\", had left Barrett's company a year earlier (towards the end of 1890), by amicable mutual agreement, and was touring the provinces, financed by Barrett — having been given the rights to perform the play \\"Clito\\" (co-written by Barrett and Sydney Grundy in 1886). Within days, it was being reported that \\"Miss Maud Jeffries, a former member of the Daly Company, is now leading lady in Mr. Wilson Barrett's company\\".Music and the Drama, Berrow's Worcester Journal, (Saturday, 12 September 1891), p.6. Perhaps her reaction to Barrett's unexpected announcement was somewhat amplified by the fact that, as a consequence of becoming his leading lady, she had to master a total of 14 leading roles in the space of just three weeks. She soon settled into her new position, and by 22 October 1891, she was playing Desdemona, to Barrett's Othello, in the first performance of an entirely new production of Shakespeare's Othello, that Barrett had adapted to accommodate Jeffries \\"unique new school acting style\\" (Thomas, 1894, p. 111). Jeffries was an outstanding success and, throughout the rest of her career, her performances as Desdemona were considered to be amongst her finest roles.

Jeffries was involved in the creation of Wilson Barrett's play The Sign of the Cross; which was originally produced at the Grand Opera House, St. Louis, Missouri on 28 March 1895.Wilson Barrett’s New Play, Kansas City Daily Journal, (Friday, 29 March 1895), p.2. By the end of 1896, Jeffries was well-established as Barrett's leading lady; and had played opposite Barrett in a wide range of works, including: * Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Hamlet, and Othello * Ben-my-Chree and The Bondman (stage versions of Hall Caine's novels The Deemster and The Bondman respectively) * Brandon Thomas' The Color Sergeant * Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman's Chatterton () and The Silver King * Barrett's The Miser (adapted from a poem, \\"A Masque\\", by Silas Weir Mitchell);See Wilson Barrett's Curtain Raiser, New York Dramatic Mirror, 1890, and, for the poem, \\"A Masque\\"). * Barrett's The People's Idol (written in collaboration with Victor Widnell) * Barrett's The Acrobat (a version of Charles Dillon's Belphegor) * Barrett's Jenny the Barber * Henry Arthur Jones's A Clerical Error * Barrett's Our Pleasant Sins;It was originally written (in 1892) collaboration with Charles Hannan; however, by mid-1893, Barrett was claiming that he had so thoroughly rewritten the play that \\"it was no longer Mr. Hannan's work\\" (World Players, The New York Clipper, (Saturday, 27 May 1893), p.182). * Barrett's Pharoah * Benjamin Thompson's The Stranger (a version of the melodramatic Menschenhass und Reue (\\"Misanthropy and Repentance\\") of August von Kotzebue) * W. G. Wills' Claudian * James Sheridan Knowles' Virginius. * Barrett's own masterpiece, The Sign of the Cross.  Australia (1897-1898)  One of the unusual features of the company Barrett brought to Australia was that it also contained the brothers of three of his female stars:See, for example, the classified advertisement for the Perth performance of Claudian in June 1898: Amusements, The West Australian, (Saturday, 18 June 1898), p.1. Norman Jeffries, the brother of Maud Jeffries, Daniel McCarthy, the brother of Lillah McCarthy, and Paul Belmore, the brother of Daisy Belmore (1874–1954).Daisy Gertrude Belmore- Garstin married Samuel Waxman, a Melbourne solicitor and barrister, on 9 April 1902 (see Marriages: Waxman—Belmore Garstin, The Australasian, (Saturday, 17 May 1902), p.1164); as well as Paul, she was also the sister of Lionel Belmore (see \\"Mr. Lionel Belmore\\", (Mebourne) Table Talk, (Thursday 23 May 1918), p.2).

The company performed in Christchurch, Dunedin, Wellington, Masterton, and Auckland, and its final performance was The Lady of Lyons, at Auckland's Her Majesty's Theatre, on Saturday, 17 February 1906. The final performance of the Knight-Jeffries Company was with The Lady of Lyons, in Sydney's Palace Theatre, on 16 March 1906.

Osborne as \\"the handsome and graceful actress, Miss Maud Jeffries\\",Pippa, \\"Social Doings in Sydney\\", The Australasian, (Saturday, 24 January 1914), p.205. whilst another theatre critic still believed that her performances far outshone those of the current favourite-of-the-day, Melbourne born actress Madge Titheradge.Theatre Royal, (Melbourne) Punch, (Thursday 1 January 1914), p.35.

Children  On 2 February 1894, and far from the United States,In 1890, the average time taken for a steamer to travel from Sydney to San Francisco (or from San Francisco to Sydney) was around 25 days (see, for example, the 1890 advertisement for the Union Steamship of New Zealand states, in relation to the \\"Sydney to San Francisco, via Auckland and Honolulu\\" journey, \\"through in 25 days\\". and representing herself as \\"Bertha Jeffreys\\" from Tasmania, she gave birth to a daughter, Florence Beatrice Jeffreys (1894-1974) – later Mrs. George Frederick Seymour — in North Carlton, Victoria, Australia.

Picture postcards  A constant, and important ongoing source of income for Jeffries was that derived from the royalties from the sale of a wide range of popular photographic postcards of her either in the costume of a particular stage role — as Mercia in The Sign of the Cross (), as Kate Cregeen in The Manxman (), as Elna in Daughters of Babylon (), as Mariamne in Herod; A Tragedy (), etc. — or studio portraits representing her \\"off stage\\", such as (), (), (), etc. In 1904 it was reported that, even though payment was only six cents per copy, Jeffries had made at least $US10,000 from royalties in less than two years;Beauty is Prized in London and Fortunes are made out of the Royalties from the Sale of Photographs, The San Francisco Call, (Sunday, 29 May 1904), p.17. and, several years later, it was estimated that some 200,000 postcards of Jeffries had been sold in Sydney over the 1906 Christmas/New Year period alone.Our Sydney Letter, The Mercury, (Saturday, 5 January 1907), p.11.

In April, the Melbourne Age announced that \\"Miss Jeffries has instructed her London solicitors to announce that it is exceedingly distasteful to her to be associated with tombstones in any way, and the offending sculptors are being brought to book for the liberty they have taken\\";Personal Notes from London, The Age, (Saturday, 28 April 1906), p.17.\\"Always thought that Maud Jeffries was of the disposition angelic, but the reverse is evidently the case, as the popular actress is said to be excessively annoyed at the idea of her classic physiognomy being reproduced by monumental masons as a suitable likeness of an angel. As Maud was never by any means \\"flighty\\", possibly it's the thought of putting on \\"wings\\" she objects to.\\" (The (Brisbane) Truth, (Sunday 20 May 1906), p.6). and, soon, the following (humorous) paragraph was being widely circulated in the Australian press: \\"Miss Maud Jeffries denies, through her solicitors, that she has authorised the manufacture of marble reproductions of herself as tombstone angels. Her solicitors, nevertheless, write from Angel Court.\\"Wit and Humor, The Grenfell Record and Lachlan District Advertiser, (Saturday, 14 July 1906), p.3.

Not that Mrs. Osborne  On Sunday 20 January 1929, on the way to Redbank Station, Jugiong, near Harden, New South Wales, a motor car driven by a Mr. P. O'Rorke, crashed into an oncoming vehicle at the South Coast town of Narooma. The driver of the other vehicle, and O'Rorke's passenger, a \\"Mrs. Osborne\\", were badly injured and taken to hospital. Given that the injured woman was a \\"Mrs. Osborne\\", from a property somewhere in rural New South Wales, it was immediately assumed that the woman was, indeed, Jeffries, and the news of the accident was widely broadcast in newspapers in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Great Britain, and the British Colonies. Three days later, it was revealed that, rather than being the supposed \\"Mrs. J.B.N. Osborne\\" of Gundaroo, the accident victim was, in fact, Mrs. Elsie Evelyn Osborne (1878-1930), née Dickenson, of Redbank Station, Jugiong, NSW, the widow of Benjamin Marshall Osborne (thus \\"Mrs. B.M.

It derives from the requirements of modern professional business practice and enables comparisons respectively an assessment of the considered persons or educational achievements from the specific view of professional practice.  Concept  Berufswertigkeit orientates oneself on a modern occupation term which covers a pronounced functionality and a high identification of the working persons with their tasks, actions and areas of responsibility (comprehensive professionalism). With this measurement concept the assessment perspective of the professional world is chosen and regarded for the first time. Therefore, the requirements of professional practice and expectations of companies towards their employees respectively of the operational environment towards employees and executives in companies and towards a comprehensive professionalism independent of formal pre-qualification are set in the center of attention and less the theoretical comparison of defined competence fields. The term is in this respect based on the term ‘employability’ from the bologna process which claims a specific orientation of qualifications on the requirements of professional practice. Furthermore, the term ‘Berufswertigkeit’ stands for a comparative moment for different professional qualifications and professional operational areas. Herein the term is based on the discussion of ‘equality’ of different formal forms of achievements. These discussions are considered insofar as the concept ‘Berufswertigkeit’ provides a standard of comparison which locates an occupational equality as a comparable value of the considered employees of the company through the concrete balance of detected fulfillments of requirements of the employees with different formal achievements. So this orientates largely independent from formal qualifications on the value contribution for the company. To realize a scientifically based assessment concept several working stages have been realized. (concept 2006, survey 2007, survey 2009, survey 2011)  Working stages  The obtained results of examinations from the view of Berufswertigkeit shall and can serve to support scientific and public discussions in education. These can be orientated on: *(a) comparability (equality discourse) and promotion of the transition between different education systems (comparative objective), *(b) support of a general recognition and also motivation, e.g. of school leavers to acquire an educational achievement in the direction of their own professional activities (promotion objective), *(c) further development of the several frameworks of qualifications like for example curricula, forms and terms of achievement due to feedback from professional practice. The concept Berufswertigkeit was coined in two research studies 2007 and 2009 among others by Prof. Dr. Matthias Klumpp  Literature  * Klumpp, M.; Kriebel, K.; Beschorner, H.; Buschfeld, D.; Dilger, B.; Diart, M.: Berufswertigkeit konkret.

It is a burrowing frog and is found in rocky gorges and creeks in the Pilbara following cyclonic rains. The species name saxatilis means \\"rock-dwelling\\". Description They are only about long with small limbs and a narrow snout. They have large glands and their toes have extensive webbing. They are brown with darker spotting and red femoral patches.

The target of the attacks were a number of trains headed to Reggio Calabria, bringing workers to the city for the protest march scheduled for the next day. The attack was part of a larger set of bombings perpetrated by neo-fascist terrorists belonging to the National Vanguard, linked to the Movimento Sociale Italiano party and Francesco Franco, leader of the revolt in Reggio Calabria sparked by the choice of Catanzaro as regional capital.  Political situation  In July 1970, after the decision from the Italian Government to make Catanzaro regional capital of Calabria instead of Reggio Calabria a major protest strike begun in Reggio, led by both leftists and right-wing workers unions.Partridge, Italian politics today, p. 50 After five days of rioting, the right-wing National Italian Workers' Union (CISNAL), led by Francesco Ciccio Franco, took the lead of the revolt, turning it to a full revolt against police forces and the formerly allied leftist unions, and became the informal leader of the rebel Action Committee and of the revolt. La Rivolta di Reggio Calabria, Archivio'900 The Italian Communist Party (PCI), the main leftist party of the country, dissociated itself from the protest after it turned violent. On July 22, 1970, a bomb exploded on \\"Treno del Sole\\", the Palermo-Turin train, in the Calabrian city of Gioia Tauro, killing 6 persons and wounding 136. The Gioia Tauro massacre was linked to the revolt. In 1993, a former member of the 'Ndrangheta (a Mafia-type criminal organisation based in Calabria), Giacomo Lauro, said he had supplied the explosives to people linked to the leaders of the revolt. La brutta avventura di Reggio Calabria, La Repubblica, January 5, 2008 On February 4, 1971, one was killed and 13 people were injured when three grenades were thrown into a crowd demonstrating outside the headquarters of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement in Catanzaro.Anti‐Fascist Crowd Battles Rome Police, The New York Times, February 6, 19716,000 Anti‐Fascists March Through Rome in Protest, The New York Times, February 7, 1971 By their own admission, many of the urban- guerilla style actions during the revolt were coordinated and led by members of National Vanguard.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 67 In February 1971, the revolt was suppressed. Prime minister Emilio Colombo offered to build the Fifth Steelwork Centre in Reggio including a railroad stump and the port in Gioia Tauro, an investment of 3 billion lire which would create 10,000 jobs, which softened the people of Reggio and helped to quell the revolt.Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy: 1943-80, pp. 156-57 The issue of Calabria's capital was resolved by a Solomonic decision: Catanzaro and Reggio Calabria became Calabria's joint regional capitals, Catanzaro as the seat of the regional administration and Reggio Calabria as the seat of the regional parliament.Vote for a Capital In South Italy Lost By Reggio Calabria, The New York Times, February 16, 1971 The revolt ended up by being taken over by neo- fascists (relevant was also the role of the militant neo-fascist movement National Vanguard) and led to unexpected electoral fortunes for the Italian Social Movement at the Italian general election in May 1972, when Franco was elected senator. The neo-fascists benefitted, because the Christian Democrats were divided, and the PCI supported the suppression of the riots.  Workers protest  The leftist unions led by the Italian General Confederation of Labour, who abandoned the revolt after the first five days due to violence and exploitation by the neo-fascists, set up a workers march in Reggio on October 22, 1972, named Conferenza del Mezzogiorno, in order to show the city that workers from the whole country were supporting their requests but rejecting the means of violence. On a less evident level, the unions desire was to weaken the apparent influence of CISNAL and Francesco Franco, demonstrating that the majority of workers were with them. For the first time in Italian unions history, a major national rally was held in southern Italy. The industrial powerhouse of the country was in the north, while the political hub is in the center, so the southern part was usually underrepresented in the unionist action. Twenty trains were chartered to bring workers from northern and central Italy, especially from the FIAT plant in Turin. One thousand shipbuilders from Genova Ansaldo shipyards booked a whole ship for their trip.  Bombs  In order to impair the rally, right-wing terrorists placed bombs on the railway. The track in Cassino was bombed. Some trains were assaulted by people while crossing stations, some of them trying to join the protest, some trying to infiltrate the workers as agent provocateur. Taunts from some bystanders to the workers, as Roman salutes and insults, were a common occurrence during the trip. In Priverno-Fossanova station, near Latina, a bomb blew up on a train coming from Bologna, causing only five injured. A new train was brought, and the workers continued their trip. A bomb was detonated on the stairs of the Palace of Justice of Latina. Two bombs exploded in Roccella Jonica, destroying two pylons of the telephone lines. On the Rome–Reggio Calabria railway a bomb is detonated in the Valmontone station. After the explosion, police found another unexploded device at the entrance of the Palmi gallery. Between Lamezia Terme and San Pietro a Maida another bomb exploded damaging the railway track. Near Gioia Tauro, the town of the Freccia del Sud massacre, two explosive devices were found on the railway tracks. Despite the bombings and the disruptions of rail service, over 40,000 people managed to reach Reggio Calabria. The unionist organizers were under great strain, fearing attacks or bombings on the march course, and were doubtful if marching was a sound thing to do after the attacks. Some workers begun the march autonomously, and were followed by the rest of the crowd. The parade received some stone throwing from provokers, but resisted responding to the violence. Ultimately, the protest became a strong message to the city and a great blow to Franco's power, effectively closing an age of turmoil in the city. Aftermath According to the neo-fascist activist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, who at the time belonged to National Vanguard, the group had been responsible for the bombs.Cento Bull, Italian Neofascism, p. 39 Senator Francesco Ciccio Franco was investigated for distributing leaflets hostile to the anti-fascist demonstration. Seduta di venerdì 2 febbraio 1973 Atti Parlamentari, Camera dei Deputati, February 2, 1973 Subsequent judicial investigations of charges of provocation and terrorism ended with his acquittal.

He made today's Dogo Onsen while he was the Mayor. He thought the tourism era would come in the future, so he made a plan to make the city into a resort city.Nikami Susumu, Ehimeken no sōseki wo sasaeta nōri Isaniwa Yukiya , 78. Early life and education Narukawa Yukiya was born in 1828 to Narukawa Kunio, a Dogo physician, and his wife, Maki.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 3. Yukiya liked studying. He was taught by Mikami Zean, a doctor in Matsuyama-han which is today’s Matsuyama. In 1845, when he was adopted by Abe Yasuo, a low-level samurai, he became Abe Yukiya, and in 1848, he married Yasuo's daughter, Isa. In 1855, Abe Yukiya founded \\"Rōbai Gejuku,\\" a private school. In 1868 when the Japanese period changed to the Meiji era, Abe Yukiya already had three children: Onoe (first son), Ran (first daughter), and Momoyo (second daughter). When his eldest son, Onoe, reached adulthood, Yukiya established him as the head of the household. Then, Yukiya himself left the Abe family and took the name of Isaniwa Yukiya.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 4-5. As Matsuyama was reorganized during the abolition of the han system, Isaniwa Yukiya began working in a city office of Matsuyama han in 1870 and in 1873, and then he worked in a city office in some prefectures in Shikoku between 1877 and 1886.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 6-7. Then in 1890 he was appointed as Dōgo Yunomachi’s first mayor (chōchō) Town Head in 1890.Ehime Shinbunsha, Hakkutsu Ehimebito, 78. He did this job for 12 years. Dogo Yunomachi before Yukiya  Dogo Yunomachi means the hot spring town of Dogo. The spring had good quality and visiting it was cheap, so it was popular among the people of the town. Because the flow of hot spring water was small, it couldn't be divided and brought to hotels. Since about 1603, the hot spring had been divided into three hot spring rooms and a free outdoor hot spring for cures. Those two springs supported Dogo Yunomachi. However, both of them were quite old and needed to be renewed.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 12. Yukiya's achievements as the mayor  Dogo Onsen Station in 1895. During the two years that Isaniwa Yukiya served as a mayor, he changed many things. First, he began charging money fora free outdoor hot spring for cures, because the hot spring was old, it needed to renew.Nikami Susumu, 'Ehimeken no sōseki wo sasaeta nōri Isaniwa Yukiya , 78. Then he rebuilt the hot spring for cures in 1892.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 42. And then he planned to renew the main hot spring.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 47.

And he also founded Dogo train corporation and he asked to make the train rail to Dogo through Ichiban-cho in 1897, because Yukiya thought Dogo Onsen station Ehime Shinbunsha, Hakkutsu Ehimebito, 79. makes people come and visit to Dogo Yunomachi.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 70. And in the same year, he made the park around the Dogo Onsen and for people to enjoy sweets, he made red and white Yuzarashi Dango, today's Botchan Dango. However, most people of the city disagreed with his these ideas until they saw the new Dogo Onsen.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 73. Disagreement Dogo Onsen in 1894. First, when Yukiya charged money for the outdoor hot spring for cures, many people disagreed with the idea, because if people of Dogo Yunomachi were charged for the hot spring, Dogo hotels' business would suffer.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 21. But Yukiya needed money to renew it, so he ignored them.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 20. Second, people objected to paying money for the construction.Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 45. Yukiya said \\"Dogo Onsen should be a fabulous building, to make people to visit, \\"It is now hard for us, but this experience will change this city in the future and it will be a great city,\\" and \\"this plan is not rash!\\"Katō Keiichi, Dōgo no yoake, 62.

It was originally the terminus of the Worsborough branch line which ran from the main line of the South Yorkshire Railway at Wombwell. The lower part of the line to Worsborough was opened in June 1850, reaching Moor End two years later, in March 1852. An inclined plane connected the nearby House Carr Colliery with Silkstone Common. By the end of the 19th century this had been replaced by an ordinary railway line, continuing the Worsborough branch to West Silkstone Junction. Like many other lines in South Yorkshire the main reason for this line was the transportation of coal, and several collieries were situated along the line. Some opened before the line was built, some were constructed afterwards. Around the lower part of the line and opened prior to 1864 was Bell Ing, Edmund's Main and Martin's Main collieries at Worsborough. Further along the line were collieries at Silkstone Common, including the ill-fated Huskar Pit, where 26 children died in a disaster in 1838. Later, in 1880, after the South Yorkshire Railway had joined with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, the line was extended, not from its terminus but from a junction a short distance before it was reached, Moor End goods then being on a short spur.

Plot Hugo, a playboy serial killer (Hugo Stiglitz), stalks beautiful women in his helicopter, seducing them under false pretenses and inviting them to his castle estate. There, he kills them in a variety of gruesome ways with the help of his groundskeeper, Dorgo. He then uses their flesh to feed a plethora of cats that he keeps in a fenced-in pit, and preserves their pickled heads as trophies inside glass jars. A doctor who stops by the castle and eventually even his groundskeeper also become meals for the cats. Finally, one brave woman defies death and miraculously escapes his clutches, accidentally making a hole in the fence around the cat pit (which eventually allows the cats to escape). During the fight, Hugo gets hit in the face. Sensing his injury, the cats gang up, descend upon Hugo, and finish him off, allowing the woman to escape free. Fan reception Blood Feast has a very small fan base, but has made a home for itself among exploitation film fans. At its release, the film caused mild controversy due to its seemingly cruel treatment of cats. One scene depicts Hugo violently grabbing a large white cat and tossing it over a high wall into its pen. The camera does not cut away, indicating that the real cat was thrown. Critical reception Shock Cinema Magazine deemed Blood Feast possibly \\"the worst film ever made about killer felines\\", and said it was very silly with little entertainment value and bad acting, although still better than Cardona's later films.Steven Puchalski, \\"The Night of a Thousand Cats\\", Shock Cinema, 1990 The Terror Trap gave it 2 stars, calling it \\"rather unimpressive\\", \\"mild\\", \\"drab\\", and \\"uninspired\\".\\"The Night of a Thousand Cats\\", The Terror Trap Tars Tarkas suggested that cats are intrinsically not very scary, even when there's a thousand of them, rating the film 2/10. \\"The Night of a 1000 Cats\\", Tars Tarkas Aggressions Animales reckoned it one of René Cardona Jr's worst films, and said that aside from a few of its ideas, there was nothing interesting.\\"La Noche De Los Mil Gatos\\" (Review), Aggressions Animales, December 5, 2009 Technical details Blood Feast was shot in color.

A total of 16 units were ordered in 1995, with an option of 16 more, at a price of 80 million Finnish marks. The first units arrived in Finland in February 1997 and testing started in Central Finland a month later. However, VR cancelled the deal at the end of the same year. By that time, six units had been delivered. The trains left Finland in 1999. One of the units was later seen in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2000 before they were sold to Cuba. The train was unofficially called the Mandolino, which rhymed with the then-new Pendolino. VR did not accept the Dm11 in regular traffic for multiple reasons. It was claimed to weigh during ordering, but the final units were overweight. This caused a problem, as the units were expected to run on lower quality tracks. The noise level in the passenger compartments was also measured to be 12 dB louder than expected. Furthermore, the windows of the train froze during winter service. The black ends of the train were seen as a hazard for drivers, and yellow was added to the nose of unit 4401 to increase visibility. VR started a new tender in December 1997, asking for 12–20 trains and a maximum of 20 options.

It is transcribed from the opposite strand to BACE1 and is upregulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease. BACE1-AS regulates the expression of BACE1 by increasing BACE1 mRNA stability and generating additional BACE1 through a post-transcriptional feed- forward mechanism. By the same mechanism it also raises concentrations of beta amyloid, the main constituent of senile plaques. BACE1-AS concentrations are elevated in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Knocking down BACE1-AS reduces amyloid production and plaque deposition.

In 1996, legislators from various parties are believed to have taken bribes from the National Union Chinese Medicine Association (中華民國中藥商業同業公會聯合會) in exchange for their support of an amendment reversing the February 1993 changes. The eight legislators in question were indicted in January 2008. Among them, Jao Yung-ching (DPP) was simultaneously indicted in another bribery case regarding a 2003 amendment to the Oral Healthcare Act. Of the eight legislators in question, Chiu Chuei-chen (DPP) and Liao Hwu-peng (KMT) were found guilty in a lower court trial, while the remainder were found not guilty.

Effects The PAL establishes labelling requirements for all items under its purview, requiring them to display an authorisation number, expiration date, usage instructions, and a list of side effects. Such items are not limited to ingested medicines, but include other items such as condoms and face masks. The Department of Health is tasked with inspections to ensure compliance with the law; private organisations such as the Consumers' Foundation have also been known to carry out clandestine checks. A February 2007 check of sex shops found that 18 out of 25 condom brands did not label their ingredients clearly or at all, while 22 gave an incorrect authorisation number or none at all. A 2009 survey, also by the Consumers' Foundation, looked at 41 face masks (17 N95 masks and 24 surgical masks), and found that 90% did not meet the labelling and packaging requirements. Sellers of drugs and medical devices are required by article 27 of the PAL to obtain a license from the Ministry of Health. Furthermore, article 37 requires that sales of all drugs, though not of medical devices, be carried out by a licensed pharmacist (or assistant pharmacist, in the case of non-narcotic drugs). Not just pharmacies, but various other types of stores including convenience stores and supermarkets, have been able to obtain the required licenses. However, many small online sellers bring covered items back from overseas and sell them on internet auction websites without knowing about this requirement. Under articles 27 and 92, fines could range from NT$30,000 to $150,000. Items covered under the law include not just those which consumers traditionally think of as pharmaceuticals, but some unexpected items such as make-up, tooth bleaching agents, hair removal products, band-aids, knee pads, and body fat percentage monitors.

He then became the chief railroad engineer for the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad. In connection with his work on the Little Rock & Fort Smith Robinson received one square mile of land south of the Cadron Ridge in Faulkner County, extending south roughly from what is today Prince Street to Dave Ward Drive. Robinson reserved the northeast corner of his property for the establishment of a town site, and the southern half as private hunting lands and as a plantation for raising shorthorn cattle, hogs, and sheep. He drove a stake in the ground at the place where Conway Station was to be constructed. A post office was built at Cadron Gap, but later transferred to Conway Station in 1872. Conway was named and became the county seat of Faulkner County in 1873. One year later Robinson married his second wife, Mary Louise De St. Louis of Montreal, Canada. Conway was incorporated in 1875, and Robinson was elected the town's mayor in 1887. He also became president of the local school board. Robinson personally pledged land for the courthouse square, and several local churches. Robinson Avenue in Conway is named in his honor. Robinson was actively engaged in Republican politics. In 1884 he laid out the federal Hot Springs Reservation. He died in Conway on 12 October 1898, two days after his 76th birthday.

History Sampiro National High School was established through the initiative of Mayor Rodolfo H. Manalo to provide solution to the problem of students in going to a distant barangay to pursue secondary education. Transportation is the main factor which hinder learners will to pursue studies due to limited access of jeepney which most of the time its aggravated by the condition of muddy and rough roads during the rainy season. In 2006 Mayor Manalo, planned to build a secondary school in this community so that transportation will no longer be a problem. This proposal came to the knowledge of Mr. & Mrs. Loreto M. Mendoza and because they feel the heartfelt sincerity of Hon. Mayor Manalo to bring education to the youth in the community they donated a piece of land. Construction of the two classrooms began in April 2006 and started the school operation on June 5, 2006. Through the help of Mr. Florencio P. Ilao, Principal II of Buhaynasapa National High School, he himself got the special permit to operate in the Department of Education and to prepare pertinent supplies of the newly opened school. The pioneer batch of the school came from barangays of Sampiro, Quipot, Sapangan, and even some barangays of Rosario. The total enrollees reach 90 students, 45 boys and 45 girls, with three teachers namely; Mrs. Margarita H. Delen, Ms. Ruvielyn B. Barcelona, and Ms. Leonilita M. Ferrer. On June 14, 2008, Mr. Lemuel M.

Life The son of Thomas Shaw, blacksmith, he was born at Repton, Derbyshire, in 1635. From Repton Grammar School he went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted sizar, 23 December 1650, and graduated B.A. In 1656 he was appointed master of the grammar school at Tamworth, Warwickshire. Before 15 September 1657 he was called to be curate of the chapelry of Moseley, under John Hall, vicar of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, brother of Thomas Hall. There being no classis in Worcestershire, he was ordained by the presbyterian classis of Wirksworth, Derbyshire, on 12 January 1658. Some months later he was presented by Oliver Cromwell to the sequestered rectory of Long Whatton, Leicestershire (a crown living). His approbation and admission by the Triers are dated 28 May 1658, and he took possession on 5 June. The sequestered rector was Henry Robinson, a half-cousin of William Laud and his death enabled Shaw to obtain a crown presentation under the great seal (1 September 1660), with the act of the Convention parliament passed in the same month making good his title without institution. Next year, however, Shaw was removed (1661) from his living at the instance of Sir John Pretyman; he obtained no other benefice, and then the Uniformity Act 1662 disqualified him, as he refused to submit to re-ordination. He removed to Coates, in the parish of Prestwould, Leicestershire. Some relatives brought the bubonic plague there from London in 1665, and Shaw lost two children. At the end of 1666 he moved to Ashby-de-la- Zouch, Leicestershire, and was appointed master of the grammar school there in 1668. Through Edward Conway, Earl of Conway, he obtained a licence (26 December 1670) from Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon, on a modified subscription (to the first, third, and first half of the second article, specified in the thirty-sixth canon of the Thirty Nine Articles). William Fuller, bishop of Lincoln, who admired Shaw's book on the plague, added his own licence, on a subscription ‘dictated and inserted’ by Shaw himself. Thomas Barlow, who succeeded Fuller as bishop of Lincoln, was his correspondent. Shaw's school was successful, and his house was full of boarders, including several who became divines in the Church of England. He wrote comedies for his scholars, ‘which they acted for the entertainment of the town and neighbourhood at Christmas time.’ He rebuilt the schoolhouse, and erected a gallery in the parish church for his scholars. On the passing of the Toleration Act 1688, he licensed his schoolhouse for nonconformist worship, preaching only between church hours (at noon), and attending the parish church with his scholars. Shaw was noted for extempore prayer, lasting two or three hours. He died on 22 January 1696. Works His first publication was a funeral oration (1657) for Thomas Blake, vicar of Tamworth. He published, besides sermons: * ‘The Voice of One crying in the Wilderness,’ 1666; 1674, (includes ‘A Welcome to the Plague’ and two other pieces). * ‘Immanuel,’ 1667; 4th edit. Leeds, 1804 (with memoir from Calamy). * ‘The Great Commandment … annex'd the Spiritual Man in a Carnal Fit,’ 1679. * ‘Words made Visible, or Grammar and Rhetoric,’ a comedy, 1679. * ‘The True Christian's Test,’ 1682 (consists of 149 meditations in two parts). * ‘Grammatica Anglo-Romana,’ 1687. * ‘Ποικιλοφρόνησις: or, The Different Humours of Men represented at an Interlude in a Country School,’ 1692. * ‘An Epitome of the Latin Grammar,’ 1693 (Calamy). His farewell sermon at Long Whatton is the eighth in ‘England's Remembrancer,’ 1663. Family He married a daughter of Ferdinando Pool (died 1676), ejected from Thrumpton, Nottinghamshire. His son, Ferdinando Shaw, M.A., was ordained 14 April 1698, became minister of Friar Gate chapel, Derby, on 25 March 1699, published several sermons, as well as ‘A Summary of the Bible,’ 1730, 12mo, and died in 1744.

Volume 12. Page 101. was an Act of the Parliament of England, which received the royal assent on 24 May 1689.House of Lords Journal: 24 May 1689: record of royal assent British History OnlineText of the Act British History Online The Act allowed freedom of worship to nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation, i.e., Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists, Congregationalists or English Presbyterians, but not to Roman Catholics. Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own schoolteachers, so long as they accepted certain oaths of allegiance. The Act intentionally did not apply to Roman Catholics, nontrinitarians, and atheists. It continued the existing social and political disabilities for dissenters, including their exclusion from holding political offices and also from the universities. Dissenters were required to register their meeting houses and were forbidden from meeting in private homes. Any preachers who dissented had to be licensed. Between 1772 and 1774, Dr Edward Pickard gathered together dissenting ministers, to campaign for the terms of the Toleration Act for dissenting clergy to be modified. Under his leadership, Parliament twice considered bills to modify the law, but both were unsuccessful and it was not until Pickard and many others had ended their efforts that a new attempt was made in 1779.John Stephens, ‘Pickard, Edward (1714–1778)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 February 2010 The Act was amended in 1779 by substituting belief in Scripture for belief in the Thirty- Nine Articles of the Anglican churches, but some penalties on holding property remained. Penalties against Unitarians were finally removed in the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. Background William III. giving his royal assent to the Toleration Act. With fears that the new king, James II, and his son James Francis would establish a Roman Catholic dynasty, the previous violent divisions among the different Anglican and Protestant sects were put aside to focus on their common adversary, the Church of Rome. Political and religious leaders from among this coalition invited William of Orange, Stadholder of the Netherlands, who was married to James's daughter Mary, herself raised in the Church of England, to invade the country and seize the crown. The resulting \\"Revolution\\" of 1688 (commonly referred to as the Glorious Revolution) resulted in success for William and Mary, who became joint sovereigns. A series of Acts of parliament assured a new constitutional settlement of this situation; these include the Bill of Rights 1689, the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689, the Mutiny Act 1689, the Toleration Act 1688, and later the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Union 1707. The historian Kenneth Pearl sees the Act of Toleration as \\"in many ways a compromise bill. To get nonconformists' (Protestants who were not members of the Church of England) support in the crucial months of 1688\\". Both the Whig and Tory parties that had rallied around William and Mary had promised nonconformists that such an act would be enacted if the revolution succeeded. James II had himself issued an act of toleration, but the nonconformists believed their future would be more secure if the Sovereign was not a Roman Catholic. Catholics and Unitarians were not hunted down after the Act was passed but they still had no right to assemble and pray. As there still remained a Test Act, non-Anglicans (including all Protestant non-Conformists, Jews, Catholics, and Unitarians) could not sit in Parliament even following the passage of the Toleration Act 1688.Jeremy Black, Eighteenth-Century Britain, 1688-1783 (2nd ed. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008), p. 131. The Toleration Act of 1712, passed following the union between Scotland and England, granted limited toleration, specifically the right to worship for Scottish Episcopalians who prayed for the monarch and used the English Book of Common Prayer.Stewart J. Brown, \\"Religion and Society to c. 1900\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (eds. T. M. Devine & Jenny Wormald: Oxford University Press, 2012). Unitarians were only granted toleration after the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813; prior to that time, denying the Trinity was a capital offense in Scotland. The Test Act remained in force until the nineteenth century. Influences Historians (such as John J. Patrick) see John Locke's A Letter Concerning Toleration advocating religious toleration (written in 1685 and published in 1689) as \\"the philosophical foundation for the English Act of Toleration of 1689\\". While Locke had advocated coexistence between the Church of England (the established church) and dissenting Protestant denominations (including Congregationalists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Quakers) he had excluded Catholics from toleration – the same policy that the Act of Toleration enacted. Implementation in the overseas colonies The terms of the Act of Toleration within the English colonies in America were applied either by charter or by acts by the royal governors. The ideas of toleration as advocated by Locke (which excluded Roman Catholics) became accepted through most of the colonies, even in the Congregational strongholds within New England which had previously punished or excluded dissenters. The colonies of Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware, and New Jersey went further than the Act of Toleration by outlawing the establishment of any church and allowing a greater religious diversity. Within the colonies Roman Catholics were allowed to practise their religion freely only in Pennsylvania and Maryland.

Repeal The whole Act, except section 5 and so much of section 8 as specified the service and offices from which certain persons were exempt and section 15, was repealed by section 1 of, and Part II of Schedule 1 to, the Promissory Oaths Act 1871. The whole Act, so far as unrepealed, was repealed by section 1 of, and Part II of the Schedule to, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969. Later developments Toleration of worship was later extended to Protestants who did not believe in Trinitarian doctrine in the Unitarians Relief Act 1813. Roman Catholics (\\"Papists\\") were allowed to worship under strict conditions through the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791. As time went on, oaths and tests that barred non- conformists and Roman Catholics from holding public offices, keeping schools, and owning land were rescinded by laws such as Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1778, the Roman Catholic Charities Act 1832, the Test Abolition Act 1867, the Promissory Oaths Act 1868, the Promissory Oaths Act 1871 and the Oaths Act 1978. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 allowed followers of that religion to be elected to Parliament and to hold most offices under the Crown, while the Jews Relief Act 1858 had a similar effect for adherents of Judaism. The Religious Disabilities Act 1846 ended restrictions on Roman Catholics for education, charities, and owning property, although Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham universities were allowed to continue to exclude Roman Catholics until Universities Tests Act 1871 took effect. By the passage of the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855, an optional system of registration for non- Anglican places of worship was passed which gave certain legal and fiscal advantages for those that registered, and \\"alternative religion was not only lawful, but was often facilitated by the law.\\" See also *Catholic Emancipation *Freedom of religion *Maryland Toleration Act – gave Protestants and Catholics the right to worship freely in Maryland *Religious toleration *Religion in the United Kingdom *Puritan's Pit References Further reading * Grell, Ole Peter, and Jonathan Irvine Israel.

Its 12 or 15 metal strings are arranged in either five or six courses. Construction The viola da terra is constructed of wood with a traditional guitar \\"hourglass\\" shape for the body, a fretted neck, and headstock supporting the tuners. Traditionally the viola da terra had wooden friction pegs inserted from behind the headstock (see illustration), rather than the \\"watch-key\\" mechanism used on Portuguese instruments such as the Guitarra Portuguesa. Nowadays the Viola da terra usually has machine heads, similar to those of the classical guitar. What at first glance appears to be the bridge is actually just the support for the bridge pins, which anchor the lower end of the strings. The bridge saddle is a separate piece, which sits on the soundboard of the instrument, in front of the bridge pin plate. Like all Portuguese violas, the number of bridge pins does not match the number of strings, and often there are two or three strings on each pin. Scale length is about 540mm (about 21.3 inches), shorter than the modern classical guitar scale of about 655mm (about 25.8 inches). 22-24 metal frets are set into the fingerboard. One unusual distinguishing feature of the viola da terra is that the portion of the fingerboard which passes over the instrument's body is set flush with the top face of the soundboard. Another unique feature is the use of a pair heart-shaped sound holes, although the instrument is occasionally made with a single round sound hole. The instrument is much lighter in construction than the classical guitar, using thinner tone woods, which supports a considerable volume of sound, despite the instrument's small size and light strings. There is also a smaller version (about three-quarter size) called a Requinto. Tuning and further info Strings are generally of metal, and very light gauge, due to the instrument's light construction. The lowest pitched \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" strings are wound, as is the lowest \\"E\\" string on 15-string instruments. All other strings are of plain, unwound steel. With 12 strings, the lower 2 courses have 3 strings each (2 of them high octaves and the third a low octave), and the higher 3 courses have 2 strings each, all tuned in unison. It is tuned A3 A3 A2•D4 D4 D3•G3 G3•B3 B3•D4 D4. With 15 strings and five courses, each course is triple strung, and the tunings is A3 A3 A2•D4 D4 D3•G3 G3 G3•B3 B3 B3•D4 D4 D4; with 15 strings and six courses, the lower three courses are triple strung and the upper three courses are double strung: E3 E3 E2•A3 A3 A2•D4 D4 D3•G3 G3•B3 B3•D4 D4 -- similar to the Viola terceira.

History The viola and other string instruments were brought during the Portuguese maritime expansion to the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde, Brazil and other locales, becoming common in the populations.José Wellington do Nascimento (2012), p.18 Due to its importance in Portuguese music it likely arrived in Angola, Goa and Macau, and as far as Hawaii by the 19th century, where it became the forerunner of the ukulele. These early cordophones, the violas, had characteristics identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula, where it appeared in iconography, poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, who identified it as just a \\"Viola\\", suggested that it first arrived in the Azores in the second half of the 19th century, brought the first settlers.Gaspar Frutuoso (2005), p.120-127 There is little documentation that dates the arrival of the Portuguese Violas de Arame in the islands of the Azores. In the second quarter of the 15th century, Santa Maria and São Miguel were the first islands to be settled. It is likely natural that these early string instruments arrived in the baggage of its first colonists.José Wellington do Nascimento (2012), p.19 The oldest reference to this instrument appeared in documents associated with the sale of lands around 1479, where the property-owner received in trade four rams and a viola. But, no records show the type or number of instruments that arrived by Azorean colonists, and over time the construction of new Violas based on the originals resulted in a substantial difference between island and continental instruments. Yet, the methods and materials used in its construction were basically the same. The Azorean Viola was the privilege of the nobility and wealthy people, creating strong roots in local culture, becoming party of the grooms marriage dowry in most cases. Instrument The instrument exists in a 15-string/6-course version, an 18-string/6-course versionVTR Terceira Acores 18 Portuguese Traditional Acoustic Guitar , and an 18-string/7-course version, and resembles a small 12-string guitar with an extended headstock (to accommodate the additional strings). The sound box is typical \\"figure 8\\" guitar shaped, with typically a central circular sound hole; the fingerboard is fretted, with (commonly) 18 frets. The 15-string instrument features six courses: three triple-strung bass courses and three double-strung treble courses. It is tuned, from lowest to highest pitched string, as follows: * E3 E3 E2 • A3 A3 A2 • D4 D4 D3 • G4 G3 • B3 B3 • E4 E4 The 18-string 6-course instrument has six triple-strung courses, tuned as follows: * E3 E3 E2 • A3 A3 A2 • D4 D4 D3 • G4 G4 G3 • B3 B3 B3 • E4 E4 E4 The 18-string 7 course instrument features: four triple-strung bass courses and three double-strung treble courses. It is tuned as follows: * C3 C3 C2 • E3 E3 E2 • A3 A3 A2 • D4 D4 D3 • G4 G3 • B3 B3 • E4 E4 Note that the lowest pitched (7th) course is frequently tuned to pitches other than 'C', at the player's discretion, to accommodate the music. The tuning to C is common, but not standard.Azores: viola da Terceira References Notes Sources  * The Stringed Instrument Database * ATLAS of Plucked Instruments Category:String instruments Category:Portuguese musical instruments Category:Azorean culture pt:Violas portuguesas ","title":"Viola da Terceira"},{"id":"32549892","text":":For more detail & team line-outs see separate entry for 1948 Senior Camogie Championship.

Maupertus-sur-Mer Airfield is a former World War II military airfield, which is located near the city of Cherbourg-Octeville in the Manche department of Lower Normandy in northwestern France.Maupertus-sur-Mer Airfield The facility was built as a French military airfield in 1937 before World War II. Used by the Germans during the Occupation of France, it was seized by the United States Army on 27 June 1944 during the Normandy Campaign. Reconstructed by the IX Engineering Command, 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion, it was used as a combat airfield. After the war, it was returned to the French government, and today it is the civil Cherbourg – Maupertus Airport. History The airfield was built by the French Air Force in 1937 as an annex to the military airfield at Querqueville. It consisted of a 1,000m grass runway. In 1939, a concrete perimeter track was added, and on 9 May 1940, it was equipped with Bloch MB.155 fighter aircraft. During the 1940 Battle of France, the aircraft assigned did not engage in any combat, and it was seized by the occupying German Army in June. It was turned over to the Luftwaffe which assigned Junkers Ju 87 attack aircraft of Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG-2) to the field. During the Dieppe Raid of August 1942, Ju 87s from Maupertus attacked the raiding Allied forces. In the fall of 1942, the Luftwaffe moved the aircraft to the east, and replaced them with six 88mm flak guns, used for anti-aircraft defense of the area. After the Allied landings in France during June 1944, the United States Army VII Corps reached the airfield on 21 June. The 4th Infantry Division, with the support of the 70th Tank Battalion captured the airfield on 27 June. The 4th's 22nd Regiment moved on the airport from the south and east at 1100 hours on D+20 (June 26), with the three battalions abreast and a troop of cavalry protecting each flank. Heavy fire from enemy antiaircraft guns held up all three battalions for several hours, but, with the aid of supporting fire from the 44th Field Artillery Battalion, the 1st Battalion took a series of positions south of the airport and captured Gonneville, the 2nd Battalion occupied the western edge of the field, and the 3rd Battalion captured Maupertus and the defenses along the northern side of the field. The enemy, however, continued to offer determined resistance and not until the following day was the airfield finally taken. Designated ALG (Advanced Landing Ground) A-15, the airport became operational a few days later by the 834th Aviation Engineers, IX Engineer Command. 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion and 877th Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion. Known as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-15\\", the airfield consisted of a 6000' (1800m) Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) runway aligned 11/29. A secondary PSP 5000' (1500m) runway was also laid down aligned 17/35. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout The 363d Fighter Group with P-47 Thunderbolts moved into Maupertus on 9 July. Planes began taking off and landing despite the fact that stacked along the main runway was a pile of bombs, live shells, duds, and 600 mines lifted from the airfield. The fighter planes flew support missions during the Allied invasion of Normandy, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops in Normandy and Brittany when spotted. The bombers also attacked bridges and German-controlled airfields in occupied areas. Prime Minister Churchill landed at A-15 on July 20 as did General Charles de Gaulle on August 20. On 22 August, the B-26 Marauder 387th Bombardment Group replaced the 363d. In addition to the bombers the 422d Night Fighter Squadron, equipped with the P-61 Black Widow night interceptor used the airfield until the end of August 1944. After the Americans moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was used as a resupply and casualty evacuation airfield for several months, before being closed on 22 December 1944. It was then turned over to French authorities.Johnson, David C.

During the Cold War, in the 1950s, a modern concrete jet runway for NATO aircraft was laid down by the United States using French contractors, along with a circular marguerite system of dispersal hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. The Cold War air base was never used and was abandoned when France pulled out of the NATO central command structure in 1967. The remains of the World War II main (11/29) runway are still visible just to the south of the current airport runway. Also a part of the secondary runway was reused as a taxiway to the now aircraft parking area to the south of the runway. The Cold War-era marguerite hardstands appear to be well-maintained, their use being undetermined. A memorial to the men and units that were stationed at Maupertus-sur-Mer Airfield is located at the front of the terminal building at Cherbourg-Maupertus Airport. It has the shape of an obelisk, on each of its faces are identified land built at that time (A1 to A26), the Fighters wings, groups Fighters, Bombs groups, Liaison Squadron who were based in Normandy, and the Air Engineers Battalions who participated in the construction of land.

Biography Born in 1948, at the beginning of the 70s he starts his studies at the School of Applied Arts in Cordoba, Spain and starts participating in collective expositions in the region of Córdoba and Jaén.Personal Website He is mostly autodidactic, splitting his time between teaching activities and artistic activities. In 1992, he joins a graphic work group for expanding his artistic techniques. Luque has a long and broad expositive trajectory and a full curriculum. Some of his works are part of the permanent collection of important art galleries and museums in Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla, A Coruña, Murcia, Pamplona and Córdoba. His work can be seen regularly in both collective and personal expositions and in the permanent collections of important art galleries and museums in Spain.Museo Ruiz-Mateos Style The sculpture style of Francisco Luque is based on a utopic ideal of human beauty where shapes are revealed through peculiar adoptions of the concepts of volume and space. His work usually talks about the nudity body or the female figure. His Venus are exuberant. It is possible to see in his works a strong disproportion in the elements, with solid and exuberant forms, that the artist develops imprinting in them a characteristic stamp and style with a very warm and tender spirit. According to some critics, this particular style is inspired in the new trends for esthetics with no or little relation to classical or academic models. Clearly influenced by the graphic work of Peter Paul Rubens, the sculptures of Francisco Luque represent women overflowing sensuality and carnality, transmitting warmth through the shape. The disproportion detected in his human figures, opposite to the canon of conventional beauty, puts him closer to Fernando Botero full of tenderness and serenity. In the sculptures of Francisco Luque, the close and defined painting stroke characteristic of Fernando Botero is transformed in smoothness and curves, which enclosed in themselves the female spirit, main motif of the artist. Work and recognition \\"Motherhood\\" Francisco Luque’s work has received a number of awards and recognitions (First Prize of the National of Painting and Sculpture of Valdepeñas; First Prize in Sculpture of the XXV Anniversary of the Arts Circle of Pozoblanco, Cordoba; Second Prize of Sculpture in the X International Contest of Villa de Rota, Cadiz; and Honorary Mention of the Sculpture Contest Club 63, Jaén; among others). His sculptures are part of the permanent exposition in the Museo Diocesano Bellas Artes of Córdoba, in the MuseoSección de Esculturas Ruiz Mateos, Cadiz, in the National Library in Madrid and in the City Hall of Santaella among others. An example of his monumental work can be seen in the promenade of his hometown, Santaella.

The boys-only school was established by the then Bengal intelligentsia along with Sanskrit College, Calcutta. The establishment date is 1 January 1824. It is situated opposite the Presidency University, Kolkata, College Square and Hindu School, Kolkata and next to the University of Calcutta and Hindu School. History It is located on College Street in central Kolkata. Its centrality is heightened by its proximity to Presidency College, Kolkata, the University of Calcutta, and the Indian Coffee House. It was established during the Governor-Generalship of Lord Amherst, based on a recommendation by HT James Prinsep and Thomas Babington Macaulay among others. The institution rose to prominence during the principalship by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in 1851, who admitted students from other than the Brahmin caste. In particular the tol or traditional Indian training school model was incorporated as a department in the 1870s. In the pre-independence era, it was one of the finest seats of academic excellence in matters pertaining to Hinduism, eastern philosophy, ancient Indian history and ancient Indian languages like Pali and Prakrit. It is particularly well known for the contribution of its faculty and students in the social, cultural and religious transformation in nineteenth century Bengal in what came to be popularly regarded as the Bengal Renaissance. In terms of scholarship and intellectual output, it contributed hugely to enriching the knowledge of ancient Indian society and interpretation of ancient Indian texts. Campus The combined campus of the Sanskrit Collegiate School and Sanskrit College is one of the largest in Kolkata. The ownership of the campus is a contentious issue, leading to conflicts about which parts of the ground the students can access, whether they can play in the College's field and whether they can use the gates of the college. Though the campus does not contain a playground, the students are free to use the field of Presidency College. The school was once combined with Sanskrit College and was situated in the same building which was built in a Victorian Architecture. Later a new four storied building has been built for the school. Students As of March 2006, a total of around 600 students study in the school. Class 11 and 12 are divided into two 'streams' known as Science and Arts (Humanities). Faculty As of March 2006 around 40 teachers are teaching in the school. Extracurricular Activities A football tournament is held during the summer. Intra-section competitions as well as inter-section and inter-class ones ensure that almost every student gets a chance to play at the official tournament. During the winter, a cricket tournament of smaller scope is held. The annual sports competition is held in two stages, a heat followed by the finals. The events include sprints (50 meters, 100 meters, 200 meters depending on different grades), short put, long jump. The students engage in sports (mostly football with some playing cricket) during the recess (commonly called the tiffin period) which lasts for 20 minutes from Monday to Friday. There is no recess on Saturday (it is a half-day), while on Sunday the school is closed. The annual prize distribution ceremony sees plays, vocational and instrumental music performed by the students as well as other cultural programs held at the Derozio Hall. During the year other smaller cultural programs take place in the school, mainly featuring Rabindra Sangeets. The school participates in quiz contests, debates, extempores and yoga competitions. The largest festival is the Saraswati Puja, which is organised by the students of the school. A science exhibition usually accompanies the two-day festival. There is a controversy over whether the school should celebrate a religious festival like Saraswati Puja as it is under a constitutionally secular government, however students have tended to support holding the puja. As with most major religious festivals of Bengal, the puja can be said to transcend religious boundaries and become an almost secular signature of Bengali culture as a whole.

The target killing or assassination was blamed on the Taliban insurgents, who are guided and supported by foreign elements such as Pakistan's ISI spy agency and Iran's Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.Is Iran Supporting the Insurgency in Afghanistan? Two other associates of Afghan President Hamid Karzai – his half brother Ahmad Wali Karzai and Jan Mohammad Khan – were assassinated in the weeks that preceded Haider's killing. Two of Hamidi's deputies and a police chief were previously assassinated. Hamidi himself survived a 2009 bomb attack on his car.

In 1999, Cash was standing in the pub when the third and final nail-bomb exploded in a campaign targeting minorities. He received compensation, and used it to fund a university course in Dramatic Writing. Some years later, he developed a two-hander play about a convicted terrorist being interviewed in prison by a psychiatrist. It premièred at the Brighton Festival Fringe in , and received the Best Theatrical Performance Award. It was later adapted for radio. In 2011, comparisons were drawn between the terror campaign, the play, and the attacks in Norway.  Background  alt=low-resolution monochrome image showing several people in a pub, scattering; one is a policeman. One man, his face circled, sits on the floor in front of the bar, looking bemused. The First Domino play takes its name from the domino effect, and was written as a response to a real-world nail bomb attack. In 1999, David Copeland, a Neo-Nazi and former member of the British National Party, who was found to have decorated his bedroom with Nazi symbols and collected news stories on racist attacks, intended to stir up ethnic and homophobic tension with a series of bombs targeting the minority communities of London. The first attack was in the largely black community of Brixton on Saturday, . The second hit the Asian community of Brick Lane on Saturday, . The third took place at a pub in Old Compton Street, Soho – the heart of London's gay community. On Friday , a sunny evening after work, Jonathan Cashauthor of the playhad agreed to meet two friends in the Admiral Duncan, as was usual for them. While he waited, patrons noticed an unattended bag. The previous two bombs had made Londoners wary; although they had been described as race-hate attacks, police had issued a warning that a gay bar could be the bomber's next target, and The Yard another pub in the area had displayed a poster warning customers to be alert. The Admiral Duncan bomb, a home made device of fertiliser and nails, exploded at The Soho alt=A blue/purple public house with large prominent signage as \\"The Admiral Duncan\\". A rainbow flag is above it, and a number of garbage bags are on the pavement in the foreground. Three people died as a result of the blast (including a pregnant woman) and many more were seriously hurt, including Cash, who was standing close to the bomb; he received injuries to his back and shoulder, and burns to his face and legs. David Copeland was convicted of murder on 30 June 2000, and given six concurrent life sentences.Buncombe, Andrew; Judd, Terri; and Bennett, Jason. \\"'Hate-filled' nailbomber is jailed for life\\", The Independent, 30 June 2000. He had been diagnosed by five psychiatrists as having paranoid schizophrenia.Hopkins, Nick and Hall, Sarah. \\"David Copeland: a quiet introvert, obsessed with Hitler and bombs\\", The Guardian, 30 June 2000. In 2007, the High Court ruled that he must serve at least 50 years.Attewill, Fred. \\"London nail bomber must serve at least 50 years\\", The Guardian, 2 March 2007. Cash received financial compensation, and used it to fund an MA in Dramatic Writing at the University of Sussex, saying he \\"wanted to do something positive with the money\\". Cash perceived Copeland as wanting to be the first domino, setting off a race war. Plot The opening scene shows a young man kneeling on a Union Jack, manufacturing a bomb, which is left menacingly on the stage. We meet him some time later, in a top-security prison, convicted for terrorism. He is interviewed by a psychiatrist who is engaged in research on sociopaths for an academic paper. The bomber's belief system, incorporating violent racism and homophobia, is revealed causing the audience to question their own beliefs. A series of psychological games starts between the prisoner and the psychiatrist, which challenges the audience's conceptions. Secrets are gradually revealed, reality is distorted, and the play ends with a surprising twist. It is a play about hatred, which illustrates how violence breeds more violence. The complex relationship between bomber and psychiatrist fails to result in a solution. Reception A preview in The Guardian in said it had \\"surprising twists [...] as the plot thickens\\", and one reviewer said it was \\"one of the most honest and hard hitting plays I have seen\\". The play received that year's Best Theatrical Performance Award. A representative of the Gay Police Association hoped the play would raise awareness; the GPA helped to raise money for producing it, and recollections from the police influenced the story.  Development  It was several years after the bombing before Cash was able to write about the events with objectivity. He wrote The First Domino as part of his M.A. Dramatic Writing course at the University of Sussex, where he met Faynia Williams, who encouraged the development and directed the production. The play was produced by the Brighton Theatre and directed by Williams. It was a two-hander about a fictional terrorist being interviewed by a psychiatrist in a top-security prison. Danny Seldon (who used to be a marine) played the part of the terrorist, the doctor was played by Cary Crankson, and music was by Rory Cameron. with \\"surprising twists\\". Cash and Williams's production company, Brighton Theatre, presented the play at Brighton Festival Fringe on , close to the of the bombing (though they state the date was coincidental). It was described as \\"honest and hard-hitting\\". Cash was then commissioned by production company Unique (part of UBC Media Group) to rewrite the play for BBC Radio 3's series of single dramas The Wire. The completely re-imagined piece was first broadcast on Saturday, . The cast list included Toby Jones, Joseph Kloska, Claire Price and Struan Rodger. Less than a year later, Cash was quoted in The Guardian in a piece reacting to the 2011 Norway attacks as conclusions were reached about the similarities between David Copeland and Anders Behring Breivik. Cash said, \\"It has made me think about the words people use. How they create a landscape. When someone is being bigoted or homophobic, everybody should be asking questions\\".

An order matching system or simply matching system is an electronic system that matches buy and sell orders for a stock market, commodity market or other financial exchange. The order matching system is the core of all electronic exchanges and are used to execute orders from participants in the exchange. Orders are usually entered by members of an exchange and executed by a central system that belongs to the exchange. The algorithm that is used to match orders varies from system to system and often involves rules around best execution. The order matching system and implied order system or Implication engine is often part of a larger electronic trading system which will usually include a settlement system and a central securities depository that are accessed by electronic trading platforms. These services may or may not be provided by the organisation that provides the order matching system. The matching algorithms decide the efficiency and the robustness of the order matching system. There are two states for a market, continuous trading where orders are matched immediately or auction where matching is done at fixed intervals. A typical example when a matching systems works in auction state is at the market open when a number of orders have built up. History Electronic order matching was introduced in the early 1980s in the United States to supplement open outcry trading (for example the then Mid West Stock Exchange (now the Chicago Stock Exchange) launched the \\"MAX system, becoming one of the first stock exchanges to provide fully automated order execution\\" in 1982).Commodity Exchange Act Cea: Issues Related to the Regulation of Electronic Trading by Thomas J. McCool, Cecile O. Trop 2000 page 18 Algorithms There are a variety of algorithms for auction trading, which is used before the market opens, on market close etc. However, most of the time, continuous trading is performed. The trading mechanism on electronic exchanges is an important component that has a great impact on the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets. The choice of matching algorithm is an important part of the trading mechanism. The most common matching algorithms are the Pro-Rata and Price/Time algorithms. Comparison of Price/Time and Pro-Rata Following are few basic remarks about the two basic algorithms and their comparison. Price/Time algorithm (or First-in-First-out) * Motivates to narrow the spread, since by narrowing the spread the limit order is the first in the order queue. * Discourages other orders to join the queue since a limit order that joins the queue is the last. * Might be computationally more demanding than Pro-Rata. The reason is that market participants might want to place more small orders in different positions in the order queue, and also tend to “flood” the market, i.e., place limit order in the depth of the market in order to stay in the queue. Pro-Rata algorithm * Motivates other orders to join the queue with large limit orders. As a consequence, the cumulative quoted volume at the best price is relatively large. * Does not motivate to narrow the spread in the natural way. This weakness is partially offset by introducing the time priority element for the first order that makes a new price. Efficiency Large limit orders can be \\"front-run\\" by \\"penny jumping\\". For example, if a buy limit order for 100,000 shares for $1.00 is announced to the market, many traders may seek to buy for $1.01. If the market price increases after their purchases, they will get the full amount of the price increase. However, if the market price decreases, they will likely be able to sell to the limit order trader, for only a one cent loss. This type of trading is probably not illegal, and in any case, a law against it would be very difficult to enforce.

The METAP, whose objective is environmental improvement in the Mediterranean region, was established in 1990 by the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the United Nations Development Programme. The goals of the network are to strengthen the environmental management capability of local administration, through decentralised activities involving technical assistance, and also to reinforce awareness of interdependence and common responsibility regarding the policies of urban environmental conservation in the Mediterranean basin.\\"Going Glocal\\": a Europeanist and non materialist political agenda History The creation of Medcities was a consequence of METAP's objective of strengthening decentralised actions involving technical assistance as the best means of promoting awareness of urban environmental problems and making those actions into a vehicle for empowering municipalities in developing countries in respect of management of urban environmental issues. Medcities continues offering this support. Afterwards, Medcities has extended its activities from the initial local environment to the wider local sustainable development field.Medcities Objectives The Medcities network is a tool to strengthen the environmental and sustainable development management capability of local administration, but it is also useful in order to identify the domains where a common activation could be the most useful means to improve the regional environmental conditions. The goals of the Medcities Network are the following: \\\\- to reinforce the awareness of interdependence and common responsibility regarding the policies of urban environmental conservation in the Mediterranean basin; \\\\- to strengthen the role and the means (institutional, financial and technical capability) of municipalities in the implementation of local sustainable development policies; \\\\- to develop awareness and involvement of citizens and consumers on urban sustainable development; \\\\- to set up a direct cooperation policy in order to implement the partnership between coastal Mediterranean cities.Medcities Network Members The network originally comprised one city in each country, with a preference for cities other than the capital. Then an accord was subsequently reached expanding possible membership to two cities per country, and including Jordan. Medcities includes today 27 cities from Mediterranean countries: \\\\- Aleppo \\\\- Alexandria \\\\- Ancona \\\\- Ashdod \\\\- Barcelona \\\\- Benghazi \\\\- Dubrovnik \\\\- El Mina \\\\- Gaza \\\\- Grand Lyon \\\\- Izmir \\\\- Larnaca \\\\- Latakia \\\\- Limassol \\\\- Marseille \\\\- Oran \\\\- Rome \\\\- Sfax \\\\- Silifke \\\\- Sousse \\\\- Tangier \\\\- Tetouan \\\\- Thessaloniki \\\\- Tirana \\\\- Tripoli \\\\- Zarqa Organisation General Assembly: it is the supreme body of the Association, and it is composed of all its members. It must be convened at least one every three years, and it gives a ruling on the items on the agenda proposed by the board, and on various others issues. It elects the President and the members of the Board. Board: the Association is governed by a Board of 5 to 9 members: the President, the Secretary General and from three to seven members. It meets at least once a year. Presidency: the President represents the Association in all acts of civil life, and he is invested with all the powers to this effect. The mandate of the President covers the period from one General Assembly to the other. The Presidency has been held by Barcelona, Marseille, Tangier, Limassol and Rome (at the present time). General Secretariat: it is an administrative body which helps the Association's President and Board in their respective tasks. It is managed by a General Secretary and it takes care of the management of the network, identifying the needs of the cities, representing the Medcities network in international events (together with member cities), ensuring technical and financial coordination, the preparation and follow-up of field projects, the organisation of the General Assembly and the Board's meetings and the publishing of presentation material. The General Secretariat has a four-years mandate, and may be re-elected. Limassol, Marseilles and Barcelona (at the present time) have held the function of Secretary General. Network activities Institutional activities Medcities is a tool that reinforces the environmental management capacity of local administrations. The network identifies areas where joint actions could contribute to improve regional environmental conditions. A key objective of Medcities is promoting sustainable urban development as a general policy in the Mediterranean. To this effect, it participates in the Nations Mediterranean Action Plan, and it is also a member of the Commission on Sustainable Development in the Local Government Area. Medcities is also a member of the steering committee for the European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign and of the Mediterranean Working Group of the Union of Cities and Local Governments. Operational activities The network's normal working procedure is based on environmental audits and medium-term environmental plans, followed by specific programmes to pursue the priorities that have been identified. Experts from Northern cities take part in developing these programmes, and those cities provide financing for one half of the cost of the work of those experts, with the remainder financed by METAP organisations (European Union, World Bank, UNDP) and the co- operation agencies of developed countries. Training is also provided through seminars, visits by technicians, training manuals and exhibitions. Medcities publishes an internal bulletin providing information on actions taken by the different cities and the network's own activities. Areas of intervention \\\\- Governance, institutional support, local finances; \\\\- Urban planning and development; \\\\- Environment and risk management (waste, air quality and mobility, water).

He is a consultant on education, governance, poverty, politics, conflict, forced migration, security, oil and gas, and development issues generally in the Great Lakes region of Africa. He was previously a coordinator of the MA programme in international relations and diplomatic studies in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Makerere University. He has taught at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology. Mushemeza is a past alternate executive committee member of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa. He has published widely in international journals. He is the editor of the Journal of Development Issues. Outside academia, Mushemeza is active in Ugandan politics. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly 1994-95 that debated, scrutinized, enacted, and promulgated the Constitution of Uganda, and a Member of Parliament of Uganda in 1996. He was a presidential advisor at the level of a senior Cabinet minister and the vice-chairperson of the Electoral Commission of the National Resistance Movement, the ruling party in Uganda (2010–2015). In his book, The Politics and Empowerment of Banyarwanda Refugees in Uganda, 1959–2001, Mushemeza explores how Banyarwanda refugees achieved reasonable levels of integration in Ugandan society because of demographic, social, economic, and cultural characteristics similar to that of the Ugandan population in the areas where they settled. If the Ugandan state had not \\"failed\\" in the late 1970s and 1980s, these refugees would perhaps have been naturalised. Although almost all the Hutu and the Tutsi refugees achieved meaningful levels of integration (as some were treated badly and abused with derogatory language), their leaders and some of the elites never gave up the dream of returning home. The opportunity to return eventually emerged in the context of civil war in Uganda (1981–86). Banyarwanda refugees joined the NRM/NRA struggle that enabled them to acquire political, diplomatic, and military skills, which they used effectively to achieve their empowerment ambitions.

The question of his identity was thoroughly discussed in newspapers and in courtrooms, and endured for almost 40 years. Due to nationwide interest in the case, the term smemorato di Collegno became a common saying since the 1930s, meaning a person who forgets something. The man was originally identified as Professor Giulio Canella, an Italian philosophy scholar and teacher who had gone missing in action in World War I. His wife, Giulia Concetta Canella, had refused to give up hope of seeing him again. When she saw a newspaper photograph of a man who claimed to have no memory of his past or name, she thought she recognized him. She went to the mental hospital where he had been confined. After a few visits, she became convinced that he was her husband. However, a few days after he was released to her, an anonymous letter was sent to the Quaestor of Turin, claiming that the man was actually an anarchist and petty criminal with an extensive police record named Mario Bruneri. After an inquiry and several trials and appeals, the court found that he was indeed Bruneri. During that time, the couple had lived together and had three children. After the final verdict was rendered, they moved to Brazil to get away from the scandal. Bruneri died there in 1941. Giulia Concetta Canella tried without success to have the decision overturned. She died in 1977. Background Giulio Canella was born in Padova in 1881. After his studies, he moved to Verona, where he became the principal of a high school specializing in education. In 1909, he founded with Agostino Gemelli the Rivista di filosofia neoscolastica, and in 1916 was among the founders of the newspaper Corriere del mattino, a Roman Catholic opinion newspaper. He married his cousin Giulia, the daughter of a wealthy landowner who had a successful business in Brazil. The couple had two daughters, the second in 1916. Mario Bruneri was a typist from Turin, born in 1886. He was homeless, an anarchist, and a petty criminal, wanted since 1922 for fraud and violence. The beginning Missing in action On 25 November 1916, Canella was serving on the Macedonian front, near Nikopole, as a captain of an infantry company committed to capturing Monastir Hill. The company was caught in a crossfire by Bulgarian soldiers armed with machine guns and was decimated. Among the missing was Canella. Some of his comrades-in-arms reported that he was severely wounded in the head, but was still alive and was taken prisoner by the enemy. After the ambush, the company fell back and regrouped, counterattacked, and ultimately took the hill despite heavy losses. Medics searched the battlefield, recovering Italian wounded and corpses, but Canella was not found. Some Bulgarian prisoners were questioned, but denied having captured a captain. Canella was listed as missing in action by the Ministero della Guerra, and a letter was sent to his wife. She never accepted the news, and kept hoping for his return. Enter the amnesiac Eleven years later, on 6 February 1927, the Chi li ha visti? (In English, \\"Who has seen them?\\") column of the national newspaper La Domenica del Corriere broke the story of an inmate of the Collegno Mental Hospital, confined there since 10 March 1926. The man had been found by the caretaker of the Jewish graveyard stealing a copper vase.\\"Smemorato e sconosciuto\\" Italian Carabinieri website. Article not found as of 2 August 2011. When apprehended by the Carabinieri, he had been strolling around Turin, crying and threatening suicide. The 45-year-old man had a full beard, and claimed to have no recollection of his past or his name. The Quaestor of Turin ordered him put in the mental hospital, in the hope that he would recover his memory. The man was well behaved and calm, and exhibited to the staff signs of some education. They diagnosed a \\"mental block\\" that prevented him from remembering his history and identity. The man was classified as Inconnu (\\"unknown\\", much like a John Doe), and given the number 44170. Giulia Concetta Canella saw the photograph of him in the newspaper, and thought to have found her beloved lost husband. She asked to visit, and on 27 February 1927, she was granted a meeting with the man. Meetings at the hospital Great care was placed in the handling of the meeting, in order to hide from the patient that the encounter had been prearranged. The man had showed signs of fear and psychological stress when confronted with staff members or visitors, so the meeting was to look to him like a random occurrence. The man was taken for a stroll in the cloister of the hospital, and crossed Giulia Canella's path without showing any emotion or sign he recognized her. Canella stated that the man was her husband beyond doubt. On a second attempt the day later, the man told his psychiatrists that he vaguely recognized the woman, and that some recollections were resurfacing in his mind. In the third meeting, the woman broke into tears, and the man hugged her, apparently recognizing his wife. On the same afternoon, a fourth encounter convinced the doctors that the man was indeed Canella, who told them about some vague recollections about his children. More encounters were scheduled to aid in memory recovery, but the man was now considered identified. In March 1927, the patient was officially recognized as Professor Canella and sent back to Verona with his wife. The story of a man lost in the war and returning to his family after ten years received a lot of news coverage, sparking hope in many other people who had also lost relatives in the conflict. The usually moderate Turin newspaper La Stampa printed the emphatic headline \\"A cry, a shiver, a hug, the light\\". Despite newspapers covering the story, no interviews were granted. No one knew what he had done in the nine years he went missing. Arrest On 3 March 1927, just a few days after the apparently happy ending, an unsigned letter was received by the Quaestor of Turin stating that the man was not Canella, but instead Mario Bruneri, a typist from Turin born in 1886, an anarchist and con artist wanted since 1922 due to some convictions for acts of violence. Bruneri was not new to jails: he had served time for accounting fraud and stealing. His criminal record was extensive. He was wanted in other cities, including Pavia and Milan, along with a woman from Brescia, Camilla Ghidini. She had a long criminal record too, with crimes against property and prostitution. The records about Bruneri included a detailed physical and psychological profiling, perfectly matching the character and aspect of the amnesiac. On Sunday, 6 March 1927, the quaestor, firmly convinced he had been tricked, arranged for the arrest of Bruneri, who was brought back to Turin the same day. Two days later, Bruneri's relatives were called in for an identification: his wife, Rosa Negro, recognized him immediately, along with their 14-year-old son, Giuseppino. His sisters Maria and Matilda and his brother Felice confirmed his identity. Bruneri had been missing for six years, when he fled the family to live with Camilla Ghidini. Bruneri refused to admit knowing the family, and faked a fainting. Another woman named Milly who had a love affair with him recognized him as Bruneri as well. Bruneri's mother, Eugenia Mantaud, while still alive, was not involved in the identification, being weak of heart. The identification was contested by Giulia Canella's attorneys on the ground that the mother had not been allowed to see the man, claiming she would have foiled the whole Bruneri family plot orchestrated in conjunction with the quaestor and police, not on the grounds of illness. Eugenia died two days later on 4 July 1929 of heart failure, causing some embarrassment to Canella's attorneys. Inquiry The quaestor ordered fingerprints to be taken, and had them compared with those from Bruneri's criminal records. Fingerprints had been sent to the central police archive in Rome when the man was initially arrested, but no matching was found at a superficial search of the huge archive. The second try proved to be 100% positive, and the Scientific Investigation School of Rome wired back a telegram confirming that Bruneri and the alleged amnesiac were the same person. Bruneri was a fugitive and had to serve two years from previous sentences, so he was jailed in the Collegno mental hospital while awaiting further trials. Giulia Canella fought the allegations and began a long campaign of appeals to the Turin Court, asking for the man to be set free on the premise that he was not Bruneri. The famous attorney and jurist Francesco Carnelutti offered to defend Bruneri, along with the lawyer and fascist gerarca (National Fascist Party member) Roberto Farinacci. Carnelutti, with the aid of political pressure, managed to have the man released on 23 December 1927. The Turin Court stated that no certain proof of the man being Bruneri had been presented, despite the identification from the criminal records. Bruneri's mother, after learning of the developments, stated that she was sure beyond doubt that the case was another scam by her son, that being his style. Rosa Negro and Felice Bruneri (Mario Bruneri's wife and brother) challenged the court decision in order to obtain an executive order from the court to bring Bruneri back to his duty to his wife and his mother. Trials Chronology *28 December 1927. The Turin Criminal Court declares the man's identity unproven despite the questor's identification and Coppola's neuropsychiatric analysis. *Early 1928. Bruneri family challenges the decision in the Turin Civil Court *15 November 1928. The Turin Civil Court acknowledges the complete and sure identification of the man as Mario Bruneri, rejecting further requests from the Canella family. *24 March 1930. The Corte di Cassazione voids the Turin Civil Court finding due to procedural errors. The Canella family is granted the right to present further evidence in their favor. *2 May 1931. After a new trial is held, the Florence Appeal Court reinstates the Turin Court's verdict, rejecting the Cassazione's request and denying further prolonging of the trial. *25 December 1931. After another appeal from the Canellas, the Cassazione denies a further reexamination of the case. The decision is a close call, with the 14 judges equally divided. Ultimately, the commission president asks to consult with the Minister of Justice, Alfredo Rocco, and votes against a new trial. Bruneri identification is confirmed again. *1946. A further request for a reopening of the case is rejected, since the outcome is not considered a \\"fascist political sentence\\", thus not subject to a new law requiring reviews of trials of prosecuted political opponents. *1964, Giuseppe Canella, son of Giulio Canella, asks to reopen the case, but is denied. The civil trial On 22 October 1928, the civil trial began, lasting over two years and ending with a solid identification of the man as Mario Bruneri. High-profile witnesses were brought into the debate, including Father Agostino Gemelli and Earl Giuseppe della Torre. The former had worked with Canella at the Rivista di Filosofia Neoscolastica, the latter was a co-founder of the Corriere del Mattino and director of the Catholic newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. Gemelli and Dalla Torre both stated that the man was not in any way Canella. They were important representatives of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and independently chose to testify. They were accused by Canella's attorneys -despite Carnelutti being a close friend of the Church himself- of being part of a secret plot to hurt the family. The Italian Army never removed Canella's name from its list of missing in action, stating that nothing had suggested that the man was Canella. An appeal from Giulia Canella was rejected by the Turin's Appeal Court on 7 August 1929. The family took the matter to the Corte di Cassazione, which on 11 March 1930 agreed to consider the case and ultimately allowed a new trial to be held in a new courtroom. Cassazione pointed out a procedural error by the Turin judges: they had denied Canella the chance to bring further evidence in his favor, in particular a new psychological survey and more examination of the fingerprints. That was required since the evidence presented by the public prosecutor came from a civil trial, not a criminal one, and could be lacking in \\"formal rigor\\". The man kept living with Giulia Concetta Canella. They had three children. Elisa was born on 21 November 1928, Camillo on 31 December 1929 and Maria on 12 September 1931. According to Italian law, they were not sons of the still missing Giulio Canella; they were registered in Brazil thanks to the influence of Giulia's father. In Florence, the Canellas' appeal was rejected again, and the man was sent to the Carceri Nuove jail to serve the remaining two years of Bruneri's sentences. He was later transferred to the Pallanza jailhouse. Giulia Canella asked for help from her friend Giuseppe Parisi, an army's captain, and Germano Alberti, a priest. They suggested going to the Corte di Cassazione again. Public opinion On 11 March 1927, just a few days after the unsigned letter accusing Bruneri, an official bulletin was published by Agenzia Stefani, the censorship organ and news agency of the National Fascist Party, stating that the man was a fake in the eyes of the party. Newspapers had to conform to the agency's directives, called veline. The case gave a big boost to newspaper sales, and many news providers over time sided with or against the Canella family. Two informal groups, the canellians and brunerians, emerged. Canellians cited as evidence the culture and education shown by the man while in the mental hospital. Bruneri was a rough and uneducated man, so the unknown man had to be Canella, the wealthy and educated professor. The man had been recognized by 25 members and friends of Canella family, and 145 other people. Brunerians responded that Bruneri was well educated himself, having studied in institutes like the ones where Professor Canella received his formal education. Moreover, they had on their side the scientific evidence of fingerprints and many witnesses, among them Gemelli and Della Torre. It was found that Bruneri, when young, had been fond of philosophy, and had studied the subject himself. In 1931, the neuropsychiatric expert Alfredo Coppola, an expert in war traumas, published Il caso Bruneri-Canella all'esame neuropsichiatrico (studio psicobiografico e medico-legale). He confirmed that the man was none other than Bruneri, and that the amnesia was plainly faked. Extremely advanced methods of cognitive analysis were used in the study. The work was so advanced for its time that it is still considered a milestone in neuropsychiatry. Coppola's work gained him the chair of Palermo University Department of Clinical Neurosciences. Other eminent contemporary scholars, among them Mario Carrara (son-in-law of Cesare Lombroso and his successor as director of the Forensic Medicine department) and Ernesto Lugaro agreed with Coppola. Among the dissenting scholars were Giovanni Mingazzini, Calligaris, Perrando and Pellegrini. Final sentence In 1931, the Cassazione Court confirmed Bruneri's identity and his remaining jail time. Among the 14 judges, seven were in favor and seven against. The Court president had to cast the deciding vote, and called Minister of Justice Alfredo Rocco to ask for three more days of debate. Rocco refused, saying \\"I'm not giving you an hour more. Let's close this clown show now\\". The court declared the couple's three children illegitimate, and their union \\"against public morals\\". A newspaper inquiry found that the man showed no sign of a gun wound to the head, as Canella would have had. None of the five trials acknowledged the man to be Canella. The identification of Mario Bruneri was confirmed by all the trials except the first. Exile in Brazil Giulia Canella lived more uxorio (as man and wife) with Bruneri: that brought scandal to her and harmed her reputation. Her father, concerned about the damage to the family name, forced her to move to Brazil along with her sons and her alleged husband (as soon as he was released from jail). Some newspapers stated that Giulia Canella herself was now convinced that he was not her husband, but had to keep pretending otherwise to avoid a major scandal. Slander and malicious allegations about the issue became common. The Brazilian government legally recognized the couple's sons and gave them the name Canella. The man registered as Julio Canella, and his title of \\"Professor\\" was legally validated. They moved to Rio de Janeiro, where the man occasionally worked on local newspapers, studied philosophy and gave some lectures. Bruneri/Canella wrote to Pope Pius XI about some of his philosophical thoughts. The Vatican secretary answered, addressing the letter to \\"Ill.mo signor dottor Giulio Canella\\", despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Bruneri died in Rio de Janeiro on 12 December 1941. Giulia Canella tried again to have the verdict overturned, until she died in 1977. Further discoveries Account of alleged meeting between Canella and Bruneri After the trial was over, an English noblewoman living in Milan wrote to the court a letter under the name \\"Mrs Taylor\\". The woman asked for a meeting to give her account of a story. In 1923, she gave shelter to a homeless man found wandering in the streets, dressed in an old military uniform. She gave him a meal, new clothes and some food. She nicknamed him \\"The Tramp\\" (Il Randagio). Later they met again; moved by his politeness, she became his friend. The homeless man told her that he had fought in the Great War, and he was sure he had a family. Unfortunately, he was suffering from consequences of a trauma, was psychologically unstable and could not remember his identity, where his family lived and many other details. He came to know a local girl, a salesgirl of dairy products, and he introduced her to the noblewoman. The two became friends and often talked about \\"The Tramp\\": from their combined experiences, the women became suspicious about the man's real identity, and ultimately begun thinking that the Tramp was actually two very similar-looking men. That would explain his mood changes, the inconsistency of his stories, and his forgetfulness of details and memories from day to day. The suspicion was apparently confirmed when the noblewoman gave a jacket to the man, which was ultimately found among Bruneri's possessions. Bruneri was indeed living in Milan at the time with Camilla Ghidini, wanted by police. Taylor alleged that the good-hearted Canella was the original Tramp. She speculated that Bruneri must have joined him in his life on the street, and the two became close friends, thanks to their physical resemblance. Bruneri later came to know many facts about Canella's life (but details were missing due to the man's mental condition), and when he feared that the police were on his track, he devised a plan to steal Canella's identity and hide in a mental hospital. When Canella's wife came to see him, he seized the chance to escape his criminal past. Bruneri's letters In 1960, new information about the case came to light. Felice Bruneri, Mario's brother, showed five letters sent by his brother to their mother while in the mental hospital. In the letters, he explained his situation and asked for the family's help, since he was hungry and repentant for his crimes. The letters were published 19 years after Bruneri's death. However, few of his other writings had survived, so they could not be scientifically compared for handwriting. Nevertheless, the letters are nowadays still considered one of the most reliable clues about the man's true identity. The brother was sorry for not having shown the letters before, but was fearful of shaming the family name and his mother. Despite the great span of time that had elapsed, the letters elicited strong reactions from the canellians, who tried to get a new trial to clear Giulio Canella's name. Denial: heirs and the Church In 1964, Beppino Canella, the first son of Giulio Canella, gave a public speech reasserting that the man was his father. Don Germano Alberti, a friend of Giulia Canella, nominated Giulio Cannella for beatification. The request was ultimately refused. After much lobbying from Canella heirs and friends, on 10 June 1970, the Roman Catholic Church officially released a press statement by Cardinal and Secretary of the Vatican State Giovanni Benelli, asserting that in the Church's eyes, the man was Giulio Canella, and his sons were to be considered legitimate. The statement clashed with the court findings and the new evidence uncovered, but was presented as certain despite being supported by nothing other than testimonies. Political aspects The case broke at a very delicate time politically, when the newly elected Fascist regime was beginning to face the many social problems of a divided country. The intellectual elite was divided. Many Catholic higher-ups sided with the brunerians, despite the official position of the Church in the following years. Politicians and journalists, especially from the liberal wing, sided with the canellians. The story was used by certain politicians as a means of distracting the public from the commission writing the Lateran Treaty, the agreement between the Church and the Italian state that gave the former more authority, a trick by Benito Mussolini to gain the support from the Catholic electorate, while risking protests from the then strong Liberal party. Leonardo Sciascia wrote about the political use of the story in Il teatro della memoria. Mussolini, while using the trials to his advantage, became concerned about the whole matter. When the case itself turned out to be a divisive issue among clerics and liberals, he intervened, trying to reduce its exposure in the national mass media. Ultimately, he ordered the newspapers to stop writing about it. Scientific importance The case was a landmark for the judicial process. Science, especially forensics disciplines such as handwriting comparison and psychiatric analysis, became a common tool in trials. The case marked one of the first uses of scientific fingerprint analysis in the legal system in Italy. Psychology received media attention, and the now famous experts who had worked on the Bruneri/Canella case were instrumental in the birth of many psychological study institutes. Stefano Zago underlined how in this case Coppola developed cognitive evaluation methods still in use nowadays. Popular culture Luigi Pirandello was inspired by the case when writing Come tu mi vuoi, a three-act drama first staged in Milan in 1930. In 1936, actor Angelo Musco was the star of Lo Smemorato, a theatrical adaptation of the story. In 1962, the movie Lo smemorato di Collegno by Sergio Corbucci was released, with Totò as the star. In 1970, RAI aired two episodes of Processi a porte aperte about the case on 11 and 13 August. Bruneri's nephews tried to have the broadcast blocked, as did Canella's wife and Don Germano Alberti. The petition started by the priest received only about three hundred supporters. Pasquale Festa Campanile presented at the Venice Film Festival the movie Uno scandalo perbene in 1984: he presented the story, but left the final open for interpretation. In 1988 in Collegno, an exhibition titled Sconosciuto a me stesso was held. French writer Jean Giraudoux was inspired by the case for Sigfrid et le Limousin. The case is mentioned in Umberto Eco's 2004 novel The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana. Radio host Fiorello created a character named lo smemorato di Cologno on his show on Radio Due. The voice was an imitation of Silvio Berlusconi (Cologno being the headquarters of his TV channels). The character lost his memory every time issues about political promises, social issues or an opposing politician were named. Berlusconi himself played the role in the last broadcast before the winter holidays in 2006. Rai Uno produced a TV movie named Lo smemorato di Collegno by Maurizio Zaccaro. On 1 April 2009, the TV show Chi l'ha visto by Rai 3 (a show investigating missing people) asked the Carabinieri RIS to examine the letters sent by Canella from the war front with the letters presented by Bruneri's brother in order to compare any traces of DNA. The examination proved inconclusive. Czechoslovak TV included an episode “The Unknown Man” (“Neznámý\\" in Czech) as the last episode of the last season (1998) series “Adventure of Criminalistics” (“Dobrodružství kriminalistiky”). French 2018 movie : L'inconnu de Collegno, directed by Maïder Fortuné.

The amended law permitted stores to sell certain over-the-counter drugs without having a pharmacist on staff, opening up the market to convenience stores, supermarkets, and other such stores. 7-Eleven was the first convenience store to take advantage of the amended law, while Aeon supermarkets also began selling OTC drugs at a 20% to 40% discount to competing drug stores (including Aeon-affiliated companies). The amendment was expected to put significant competitive pressure on drug stores. However, the law continued to ban internet sales of OTC drugs, which the Ministry of Health had previously justified by stating that drug sales should only be conducted in person by pharmacists or other qualified vendors who could explain the side effects of the drugs. On May 24, 2013, the Government Cabinet approved a revision of Pharmaceutical Affairs Law to simplify the approval process for medical devices and regenerative medicine products, the safety of regenerative medicine using iPS cells (stem cells). According to the revised bill, medical equipment can be checked by the private organization including regenerative medicine products and validation of the post-marketing effectiveness.http://www.asahi.com/politics/update/0524/TKY201305240029.html References External links *Full text of the law *English translation of full text of the law Category:1960 in law Category:Drug control law Category:Japanese legislation Category:Medical law Category:Drug policy of Japan Category:Regulation of medical devices Category:Regulation in Japan ","title":"Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices"},{"id":"32550261","text":"Walter Wright may refer to: * Walter Wright (cricketer) (1856–1940), English cricketer * Walter Wright (academic), English Tudor academic administrator * Walter C.

Effects The law has brought difficulties to diabetes patients, as the test strip papers required by glucose meters used for home blood glucose monitoring were considered pharmacological supplies under the law, and thus legally could only be sold by pharmacies. Medical supply shops were tacitly permitted to sell the test strips as well, but a 2005 crackdown on 200 such shops in Suseo-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul brought the law into the spotlight. Diabetics complained that different meters required different test strips, and pharmacies did not always carry the required brands. An official at the Korea Food & Drug Administration said the government might resolve the issue by reclassifying the test strips as non-pharmacological supplies, but the issue would take time due to conflicts of interest.

There are three spectroscopically different copper centres found in multicopper oxidases: type 1 (or blue), type 2 (or normal) and type 3 (or coupled binuclear). Multicopper oxidases consist of 2, 3 or 6 of these homologous domains, which also share homology with the cupredoxins azurin and plastocyanin. Structurally, these domains consist of a cupredoxin- like fold, a beta-sandwich consisting of 7 strands in 2 beta-sheets, arranged in a Greek-key beta-barrel. Multicopper oxidases include: *Ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase), a 6-domain enzyme found in the serum of mammals and birds that oxidizes different inorganic and organic substances; exhibits internal sequence homology that appears to have evolved from the triplication of a Cu- binding domain similar to that of laccase and ascorbate oxidase. *Laccase (urishiol oxidase), a 3-domain enzyme found in fungi and plants, which oxidizes different phenols and diamines. CueO is a laccase found in Escherichia coli that is involved in copper-resistance. *Ascorbate oxidase , a 3-domain enzyme found in higher plants. *Nitrite reductase , a 2-domain enzyme containing type-1 and type-2 copper centres. In addition to the above enzymes there are a number of other proteins that are similar to the multi-copper oxidases in terms of structure and sequence, some of which have lost the ability to bind copper. These include: copper resistance protein A (copA) from a plasmid in Pseudomonas syringae; domain A of (non-copper binding) blood coagulation factors V (Fa V) and VIII (Fa VIII); yeast Fet3p (FET3) required for ferrous iron uptake; yeast hypothetical protein YFL041w; and the fission yeast homologue SpAC1F7.08.

In July 2011 she initiated the 2011 Israeli Social Justice Protest that took place in Tel Aviv and were the largest social protests in Israel's history. Following the civil protest Leef focused on issues regarding fair housing in Israel and established various independent social projects. In 2017 Leef debuted the first movie she directed named \\"Before My Feet Touch the Ground\\", which is a documentary about the 2011 protest from her personal perceptive. The film was chosen to open the \\"Docaviv - Tel Aviv International Documentary Film Festival\\" in May 2017, and was part of the official selection of the 2017 \\"International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam\\".  Biography  Daphni Naomi Leef is the daughter of the Israeli composer Inam Leef, and the great-granddaughter of the Israeli engineer Zalman Leef. Leef was born in Jerusalem and raised in the Rehavia neighborhood of the city. She attended Gymnasia Rehavia junior high. In 2002, at age 16, she moved with her family to Kfar Shmaryahu, a local council within the Tel Aviv District ranked very highly on the Israeli socio-economic scale. During her high school period Leef majored in Film Studies at a high school in Ramat Hasharon. In September 2002 Leef signed a public letter along with dozens of other pre-army-aged youths that declared their refusal to serve in the \\"army of occupation\\". Leef did not serve in the IDF, but claimed in an August 2011 interview that she did not serve in the military due to medical reasons. In 2005, after she finished high school, Leef moved to Tel Aviv and began studying in the film department of Tel Aviv University. Leef graduated from the university in 2008. She became a professional video editor and has created many short films, music videos for Israeli singers (such as Eran Tzur, Michal Amdursky and Noam Nevo) and films for various political NGOs, including a short work for the \\"Free Israel\\" association (\\"ישראל חופשית\\"), which promotes civil marriage in Israel.  2011 protests  During June 2011 Leef received a notice to vacate the apartment that she had rented in Tel Aviv for the previous three years. After several weeks of searching to no avail for a new apartment within reach of her film-editing job, Leef discovered that the rental prices in the entire Tel Aviv metropolitan area had doubled in the previous five years. As an act of protest Leef decided to open a Facebook page and ask people to help her in organizing a protest. Ten people, among them Stav Shaffir (later to become MK in Israeli Parliament), Regev Contes (filmmaker) and other activists, replied and attended a preparation meeting, in which they decided to pitch tents in Tel Aviv, claiming young people in Israel have no way to pay their rent. Two weeks later, on 14 July, they pitched five tents at the Rothschild Boulevard in Tel-Aviv, while police warned them against camping in the public sphere without permission. Soon afterward the protests gained momentum as thousands joined the protests, pitching tents in the central streets of cities across Israel. sparking off the 2011 Israel housing protests. On 29 August 2011, in the context of aspersions about Leef's background and intentions, Leef abruptly ended an interview when asked about not doing mandatory military service or Sherut Leumi, her affluent upbringing, what the Trajtenberg Committee was dealing with, and a question about her lack of presence or if she has even slept in the Tel Aviv tent area. She revealed that she received an exemption from the army for having epilepsy but had volunteered in a children's shelter, and that she had not slept in the Rothschild Boulevard tents the preceding week.  2012 protests  Dafne Leef at a rally in 2011 At 22 June 2012, Daphne Leef and several other activists tried to restart the housing protests by re-erecting a tent encampment in the Rothschild Boulevard in Tel-Aviv. The municipality had not issued a permit and as a result Leef, along with eleven other activists, were arrested when they resisted the 20 policemen and municipal inspectors who arrived to dismantle the tents. The protesters' tents were confiscated by the police forces as well.  \\"Before My Feet Touch the Ground\\", 2017 Movie  Leef's debut film as a director came out in 2017 in the opening of the Docaviv - Tel Aviv International Documentary Film Festival. The documentary movie uses news clips and Leef's own video footage, as she looks back on the turbulent period in 2011 when she was transformed from a somewhat naive young woman into a celebrated and controversial national icon. The movie was produced by Yael Abecassis and Hillel Roseman, and was edited by Tal Shefi. Controversy As the housing protests continued, personal criticism of Leef and her political views mounted. Opponents charged that Israeli left-wing media and political organizations were exploiting the demonstrations and economic distress of the Israeli public for political purposes, with the intention of overthrowing the right-wing Netanyahu government.חדשות מחלקה ראשונה - News1: מפגיני הדיור - 'אידיוטים מועילים' On 15 July 2011, demonstrators drove Likud Knesset member Miri Regev out of the tent encampment. Regev responded by saying that Leef \\"represents the extreme left.\\" Leef denied this, claiming her protest was first and foremost a social struggle. On 20 July 2011, Im Tirtzu announced it would no longer take part in the housing protests because the New Israel Fund and anti-Zionist left-wing groups were being directly involved. Im Tirtzu said, \\"Daphni Leef, who is perceived in the media as the initiator of the struggle, is actually a video editor for the New Israel Fund and Shatil.\\" At a press conference held on 26 July 2011 Leef responded: \\"What hasn't been said about me in the recent days? When we came here with our tents about ten days ago, some said we are spoiled children from Tel Aviv, some said we are leftists, but after more cities from across the country and as more people from across the entire political spectrum in Israel joined the protests — all understood that we represent all the people.\\" In an interview with the Israeli radio network Galei Tzahal on 3 August 2011, Leef referred to the \\"tent representation\\" group, which seeks to democratically replace the leadership of the housing protest: \\"It hurts me, things have been said about my character, I hope it would be resolved.\\" On 3 November 2011, Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Leef and partner Stav Shaffir decided to officially establish a fund so that they could fundraise money to pay for the continuing efforts.  In popular culture  * In October 2011 the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra premiered Matti Kovler's \\"Fanfare to Israel,\\" inspired by Daphni Leef, and quoting from Eviatar Banai's song \\"Yesh Li Sikui.\\" The performance took place at the closing Gala concert of the Israeli Music Celebration at the Henry Crown Symphony Hall, Jerusalem Theater, with Leef's father, composer Yinam Leef in the audience. * In 2011 the Israeli poet Apollo Braun recorded the song \\"Inspired By Daphni Leef\\". The song appears in his spoken word CD \\"The Obsessive Poet\\". * In May 2012 the Israeli rock band The Giraffes released the song \\"Daphni Daphni\\" (דפני דפני), \\"as a homage to the person who ignited the protests\\".

However, unionized workers may earn higher wages. Many commercial cleaning companies provide on- the-job training for all new employees due to the nonexistence of tertiary based courses for the cleaning industry. A trend in the cleaning industry is the elimination of the usage of more hazardous chemicals such as drain cleaners due to liability and environmental concerns.

The superfamily includes a wide variety of enzymes as well as non-enzymatic seed storage proteins. Members of the superfamily play a role in allergy, especially seed storage proteins like 7S and 11S globulins, also known as vicilins and legumins, respectively. These proteins can be found at high concentrations in seeds of both mono- and dicotyledonous plants and are an important component of the normal human diet.  History  Thomas Burr Osborne at the end of the 19th century was the first person to systematically study seed storage proteins by their solubility characteristics. He established 4 classes of proteins: water-soluble albumins; salt soluble globulins: vicilin—typically having sedimentation coefficients, S values (a measure of the protein mass determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation) of about 7 Svedberg units (hence the common name 7S globulin) and legumin (11S); alcohol/water-soluble—cereal—prolamines; and a fourth class, glutelins, of difficultly soluble proteins no longer recognized and now considered low solubility prolamin or globulin storage proteins . Gluten consists of a mixture of prolamins: 'glutenin' and 'gliadin'. Osborne and his Yale colleague Lafayette Mendel are considered the 'founders' of the modern science of nutrition. Earlier, the fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) deBary was the first oxalic acid (oxalate), secreting organism to be described as early as 1886 in Botan. Z. by A. de Barry. However, since oxalate secreting fungi are not a major threat to crop cereals no studies of this interaction were made for almost 100 years. In the early 1980s a protein dubbed 'germin' was identified in germinating wheat embryos; and in the early 1990s (1992) it was found to be an enzyme having oxalate oxidase (OXO) activity converting an oxalate substrate into carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. This latter-day discovery of 'germin' was soon followed by the discovery of the 'cupin superfamily' of proteins.  Classification  Legumin and vicilin share a common evolutionary ancestor, namely, a vicilin-like protein in a fern-spore which also exhibits some characteristics of legumin. Each of these proteins contains equivalent 'subunits' indicating an evolution from a single-gene ancestor which has been duplicated during evolution. It was suggested that \\"germin\\" , {first found and only known to occur in the \\"true cereals\\": barley, corn, oat, rice, and wheat} a plant enzyme, oxalate oxidase 'one-very-tough-little- protein' was such an ancestor. This hypothesis stimulated a search for the evolutionary roots of the seed storage globulins which include such food proteins as the legume soy protein—the gold standard for plant-based proteins—due to its balanced content of 7S and 11S globulin protein, other beans, the pseudocereals buckwheat, & quinoa, pumpkin seeds, cocoa, coffee, nuts, and the two cereals oats and rice. This search turned up a new realm: that seed storage globulin proteins (7S & 11S), as well as many other non-storage plant proteins {notably germins (G-OXOs), germin-like proteins (GLPs)} and microbial proteins belong to a vast superfamily of proteins dubbed the 'cupin superfamily' of proteins, named on the basis of a conserved beta-barrel fold (cupa the Latin term for a small barrel) originally discovered within germin and germin-like proteins from higher plants. Germin is a monocupin and 7S & 11S are each bicupins. It is a large and functionally immensely diverse 'superfamily' of proteins, numbering in the thousands, that have a common origin and whose evolution can be followed from bacteria to eukaryotes including animals and higher plants. \\"Cupins\\" are the most functionally diverse protein superfamily occurring in all spermatophytes (seed bearing plants). \\" GLPs, moreover, are now known to be ubiquitous plant proteins, no longer linked only to cereal germination, but involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. \\"G-OXOs and GLPs are plant do-all proteins.\\" Germin of the \\"true cereals\\" is known as the 'archetypal' member of the cupin superfamily, however it is not to be considered an empty cask or barrel but a 'jellyroll' jelly roll fold in which six monomer subunits are wrapped in three dimensions to form a barrel shape. This structure accounts for its astonishing 'refractory' nature toward various 'denaturing' agents: all germins share a remarkable stability when subjected to heat, detergents, extreme pH and resistance to broad specificity proteolytic (digestive) enzymes. Seed storage proteins of grasses and cereals belong to the eponymous prolamin superfamily which also includes plant albumins(2S). Prolamin seed storage proteins so characteristic of cereals and grasses is not considered very nutritious because of its high content of the amino acid proline which it shares with gelatin and its low content of lysine, a vital amino acid. Germin was initially identified in the early stages of wheat seed germination, thus its name. Domesticated cereals most notably 'hexaploid' bread wheat ( pasta wheat is tetraploid) was selected by humans for its resistance to fungal pathogens. Many years later it was found to have oxalate oxidase activity generating 'antimicrobial' hydrogen peroxide from a substrate of the double- acid, oxalic acid, secreted by an invading fungus or other microbe. A reaction between oxalate and the calcium cation makes calcium oxalate, a type of 'kidney stone' in humans. Amazingly, oxalate is a metabolite of ascorbate (vitamin C), and it is worth emphasizing that ascorbate is a direct precursor of oxalate in plants.  Application  The 'sweetest' outcome from our knowledge of germin biochemistry is that the wheat-germin gene is the obvious candidate for insertion into the American chestnut for producing a transgenic American chestnut. This tree called the \\"perfect tree\\" has no resistance to Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus. The fungal mycelium produce oxalic acid which eats away at the tree's bark giving it a portal into the underlying growing tissue. The xylem vessels carrying water become plugged through the chelation of calcium cations by oxalate just as in the kidney. Death is by strangulation as a canker encircles and girdles the trunk. Transgenic American chestnut seedlings have been produced and field tested carrying the wheat germin gene for oxalate oxidase which breaks down oxalic acid the caustic chemical excreted by the invasive chestnut blight fungus.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/magazine/american-chestnut.html Soybean Protein Nomenclature: Aprogress.

Local people have no idea who made them or how they were used. Over the years, it has been speculated that they were graves, defensive positions, or storage places. Recent thought is that they were storage pits built during the time of the Inca Empire (1438-1533).  Description  The band lies between and extending in a basically north-south orientation over uneven terrain. The band begins at the edge of a valley and runs up a hill for about 1.5 km. The holes, actually pits with raised edges, are about 1 meter in diameter and 50–100 cm deep. They are arranged in discernable blocks or segments along a band that varies in width from 14–21 meters, with an average width of about 19 meters. Recent investigations Modern attention was drawn to the site in 1933, when the aviator Robert Shippee published an aerial photograph in National Geographic. Victor Wolfgang von Hagen surveyed the area in 1953. In The Royal Road of the Inca he describes these as pre-Inca graves, writing that: > These circular, stone-lined although unused graves lay in rows, seven to > nine, and marched up the 50° angle to the slope called Mt. Sierpe, that is > the “shaking” line of graves reminding the one who named it of a serpent. > There are over 5,000 such graves; empty, graves in so far as they are > circular and stone-lined, and of the same construction of those graves which > are found with mummies, weavings and pottery. For years, ever since 1931 > they appeared on the photographic plates of the aerial surveys of the > Shippee-Johnson expedition, they were the \\"strange and mysterious > pockmarks”, but when discovered and surveyed by the von Hagen expedition in > 1953 and found to be unused graves, the mystery was compounded. The Inca > engineers would have seen the same phenomena but as in the case of the > equally mysterious Nasca lines, they filled in those which interfered with > the road and ran it over and through them.

Archaeologist John Hyslop wrote in his 1984 book The Inka Road System that \\"Circular structures, sometimes semisubterranean, that may have been used for storage are also found on the Peruvian south coast in the sites Quebrada de la Vaca (Andes 1960:252, 253) and at Tambo Colorado. Hundreds of stone-lined circular holes in rows have been found on a low ridge on the north side of the Pisco Valley (Shippee 1933:93; Wallace 1971:105-106). Although their role has not been determined, a hypothesis for investigation is that they were used for storage. They are between two important Inka sites (Tambo Colorado and Lima la Vieja), and very near the point where the Inka coastal road crosses the road to the highlands. They might be one of the empire's larger storage sites.\\" In 2015, archaeologists from UCLA made a brief visit to the site, using photography from drone aircraft to create a detailed map. They speculate that the holes could have been used to measure produce given to the Inca state as tribute; the measurements might have been recorded on Incan khipus and reported to government officials. The archaeologists hope to do further studies to detect pollen or phytoliths that could tend to confirm this hypothesis.  References   Further reading  *Engel, Frederic. 2010.

The mines were active during the mid and late Neolithic between 4,300 and 2,200 BC. Declared to be \\"remarkable for the diversity of technological solutions used for extraction\\" the site and its surroundings were inducted into the UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 2000.  Description  Discovered in 1843, the first excavations were undertaken by the mining engineer Alphonse Briart and two others during railway construction in 1867,Alphonse Briart et al., Rapport sur les découvertes géologiques & archéologiques faites à Spiennes en 1867 (Mons, 1872), on Google Books. with results presented to the International Prehistoric Congress held in Brussels in 1872.Thomas Wilson, Arrowpoints, Spearheads, and Knives of Prehistoric Times (Washington DC, 2007), ch. 4. Intermittent excavations have been carried out up to the present day. The Mines of Spiennes cover some of downland four miles south-east of the city of Mons. The site is dotted with millions of scraps of worked flint and numerous mining pits, that Neolithic settlers have gradually turned into vertical mine shafts to depths of over . Underneath is an elaborate man-made network of caverns accessible via the many shafts. A seminal stage of human inventiveness, technological and cultural application and progress, the transition between opencast and underground mining for flint nodules is impressively displayed and documented. Research has illustrated Neolithic techniques for the cutting of the flint and the extraction of large slabs of flint, that weighed up to hundreds of kilos. The nodules were extracted using flint picks. The stones were then knapped into rough-out shapes of axes, and finally polished to achieve the final state. The SILEX'S Interpretive Centre opened in spring 2015. The rough-outs were exchanged over a wide area, about , and were often polished at their destination. Polishing strengthens the final product, making the axe- or adze-head last longer. The smooth surface also aids the cutting action by lowering friction with the wood. The axes were used initially for forest clearance during the Neolithic period, and for shaping wood for structural applications, such as timber for huts and canoes.  Similar sites  The site has been compared with Grimes Graves and Cissbury in the United Kingdom, and Krzemionki in Poland, which are also sources of flint stone. However, different hard rocks were used for the polished stone axes. There are several locations in Britain where fine-grained igneous or metamorphic rock was collected from screes or opencast mines, then roughed out locally before trading on to other parts of the country. Examples include the Langdale axe industry, Penmaenmawr and Tievebulliagh.  References  ;Bibliography * C. Guillaume, Ph. Lipinski & A.

Due to crisis environment and uncertainty in the market fundamentals, investors started to use the Federal Reserve's information found in its policy pronouncements. Rational herding in financial markets can take place because some investors believe others to be better informed than themselves, and follow them, disregarding their own information or market fundamentals.Handbook of Behavioral Finance edited by Brian Bruce 2010 page 103 This is based on the idea that if information is costly for an uninformed actor, his ignorance is rational and that, if he cannot afford the information, there is a potential benefit of following another player who can pay for such information. Reliance on rational herding can be a source of instability in financial markets. There are also scholars who note that rational herding is still based on anecdotal observations and that there is lack of empirical evidence due to the way the so-called \\"herding literature\\" focuses on the price or investment patterns, information that is readily available.

Strinning was born in Kramfors, and came from a Swedish family with origins in the 18th century in Ångermanland. The name was taken at the beginning of the 20th century by the family farm \\"Strinningen\\" north of Härnösand. Nisse Strinning was best known for the String bookshelf system that he and his wife, the designer Kajsa Strinning, designed in 1949 for a contest initiated by Bonnier, a leading Swedish publisher. In the 1940s, he studied architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (KTH). Already as a student, he designed a dish rack which consisted of plastic coated metal wires. Dish rack, which was named elfa (not to be confused with electronics company ELFA), became very popular and was then starting when he and his wife created the famous String shelf. In 1952 he founded the two companies String Design AB and Swedish Design AB. Together with his wife, he designed many plastic items in 1960—and 1970s. Nisse and Kajsa Strinning are rightly seen as an icons of Scandinavian Modern design and the String Shelving System as a modern contemporary design classic (see other articlehttp://www.string.se/index.asp?ID=10&ICON;=284&LAN;=2).

With revenues of over $4 billion, it functions as a holding company for Stewart and Lynda Resnick and as such is a vehicle for their personal investments in a number of businesses. The company currently counts as business divisions the following brands: juice company POM Wonderful, bottled water company FIJI Water, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Almonds, Wonderful Halos, JUSTIN Vineyards and Winery, Landmark Vineyards and Winery, JNSQ Wines, pest control company Suterra, flower delivery service Teleflora, sea freight company Neptune Pacific Line and in- house marketing agency Wonderful Agency. History As the current incarnation of the Resnicks' holding company, The Wonderful Company has a number of predecessors. The Resnicks first bought Teleflora and API Alarm Systems in 1979, at which time Lynda left her advertising job to become Teleflora's executive vice president of marketing, and eventually president, securing flagship TV sponsorship roles which grew the company into the nation's largest floral wire service. In 1986 they purchased The Franklin Mint, known for making model cars, souvenir plates, figurines, and Civil War- inspired chess sets. Stewart Resnick served as CEO and Chairman of the Franklin Mint Company until its sale to a private equity group in 2006. In 1989 the Resnicks formed Paramount Farms to begin growing and harvesting pistachios and almonds in California's Central Valley. In 1993, the Resnicks renamed the holding company Roll International (later Roll Global) and continued to expand their portfolio of complementary businesses in food and beverages. As of June 1, 2015, Roll Global changed its name to The Wonderful Company. Brands , the following brands are among those of The Wonderful Company and its subsidiaries:http://www.wonderful.com/press/wonderful-company- announcement/  POM Wonderful  In 2002 the Resnicks founded POM Wonderful. The company's main product is pomegranate juice, which is sold in a trademark \\"double-bulb\\" bottle. The company also packages and sells POM POMS fresh pomegranate arils as well as fresh pomegranates. The company also sells a variety of pomegranate flavored teas. In 2017, POM Wonderful acquired the pomegranate distributor Ruby Fresh.  FIJI Water  The Resnicks acquired the FIJI Water business in 2004, after which Lynda supervised marketing that focused on promoting the uniqueness and exotic nature of the water. According to Resnick's book, sales of Fiji Water soon increased by 300%, and in 2008 it became the largest imported bottled water brand in the US.  Wonderful Halos  In 2013 the Resnicks launched Wonderful Halos mandarins, with a $220 million facility in the San Joaquin Valley capable of processing 19 million mandarins a day. By 2017 Halos was the #1 segment brand, forecast to have around 70-80% market share by 2018. In 2017, Halos accounted for around three- quarters of growth in the mandarin category, and 12% of total produce sales growth.  Wonderful Pistachios and Almonds  Wonderful Pistachios & Almonds is the world’s largest vertically integrated pistachio and almond grower and processor, cultivating and harvesting more than 65,000 acres of pistachio and almond orchards and delivering more than 450 million pounds of nuts globally each year. Known for its Get Crackin’ campaign, Wonderful Pistachios was the US's fastest-growing snack brand and the number 1 tree nut brand in 2018.  Wonderful Sweet Scarletts  A variety of red grapefruit known for its sweetness, The Wonderful Company’s Sweet Scarletts brand has been grown and packed in South Texas since 2014 and distributed to grocery stores nationwide.  JUSTIN Wines  In 2010 the Resnicks purchased Justin Vineyards and Winery, a 50,000 case-production winery in California's Central Coast region founded in 1981. JUSTIN Wines specializes in Bordeaux style varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, and was named the 2015 American Winery of the Year by Wine Enthusiast Magazine.  Landmark Wines  Acquired in 2011, Landmark Wines is a Sonoma County vineyard specializing in high-quality Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Syrah. Founded in 1974, Landmark's Overlook Chardonnay has appeared on Wine Spectator's Top 100 list six times.  JNSQ Wines  In 2019, the Resnicks launched a female-focused luxury wine brand, JNSQ (named for the French phrase \\"je ne sais quoi\\"). JNSQ Rosé Cru and JNSQ Sauvignon Blanc made their debut alongside the Fall/Winter 2019 collection from California-born designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, who brought their show to Los Angeles (instead of New York Fashion Week) on February 5.  Suterra  Using technology from naturally occurring pheromones, Suterra has become the world’s leading provider of biorational products for crop protection and pest control. Founded in 1984, it offers mating disruption products as well as various traps and lures that help protect fields and orchards against different pests.  Teleflora  The Resnicks purchased Teleflora in 1979, at which time Lynda left her advertising job to become the company's executive vice president of marketing and eventually president. In 2019, Teleflora had over 13,000 member florists throughout the U.S. and Canada, with an additional 20,000 affiliated florists outside North America, making it the largest privately held floral wire service in the world.  Controversy  The Wonderful Company has been criticised for its aggressive consumption of water in the drought ridden state of California. The company has expanded its business even as California residents have faced water shortages and the water ecosystem has been irreversibly damaged. Residents of the Central Valley, while the target of the company's charitable giving, suffer from an acute water crisis. It is also claimed that the company lobbies to privatise the State's water and funds opposition research on the impact of farming on the drought.  Central Valley philanthropy  Since 2010 The Wonderful Company has made significant improvements to the communities that dot California's Central Valley, especially in the city of Lost Hills, where half of the homes have at least one family member working at The Wonderful Company. Over the years, the Resnicks and The Wonderful Company have given over $100 million to build two charter schools, and $20 million to create an agriculture-career college prep program for seven public high schools in California's Central Valley. Forbes noted that between 2010 and 2015 \\"the company has helped 55,000 students in the region through programs like college prep, scholarships and summer camps. One education program they built and partially funded, which was awarded an $8.5 million grant from the state in June 2015 to help them expand it, gives 200 students a year partial agricultural education and college scholarships to gain technical experience. It will reach 2,000 students in four years.\\" The Wonderful Company has also been a leader in minimum wage increases. In 2019 the company increased its minimum pay to $15 an hour for all of its California workers, three years ahead of the state-mandated deadline. In 2006 the company introduced the Wonderful Giving Program which has since empowered employees to direct over $37 million in company funds to 7,200 different non-profits. The largest local recipient of donations under the program is Wasco Union High School, which during the 12 years prior to 2018 received more than $210,000, thanks to Wonderful Giving. Lost Hills Elementary School, the program's second-leading recipient, took in $141,000. In 2016 the US Chamber of Commerce recognized Lynda Resnick and The Wonderful Company with their Corporate Citizenship Award for their work in community improvement.

Thain, sailing from the Port of Liverpool to the Port of Quebec on April 17, 1847. 462 passengers boarded at Liverpool. Typhus was caught by two male passengers in Liverpool and broke out during the crossing. Scarlet fever also erupted. Of the 462 passengers, 117 had died from typhus by the time the ship reached Miramichi on June 3. 100 more were deathly ill. Only 53 survived to reach Quebec. The passengers were well off financially, but the ship was refused permission to land at Middle Island until the captain threatened to run his ship aground on the island. Permission was grudgingly granted. Joseph Cunard sent a boat to tow the vessel to the island at night. Thain and the only crew member able to stand transferred the rest to the island. Since the quarantine station had been moved to Sheldrake Island, the only shelter available was several drafty fish sheds. Thain and the rest eventually fell ill as well. He was ill for 27 days, but recovered. Another building was eventually built on the island, taking only 4 days. Of the surviving passengers, only 53 were willing to continue the voyage to Quebec in the vessel. The rest were put off at Chatham. The ship later sailed for the Port of Belfast, arriving on September 27, 1847 with a new crew and master.

In 1879–80 the church was enlarged by Sharpe's successors, Paley and Austin, who rebuilt the chancel, reseated the church, and added an organ chamber and a porch at a cost of £1,307. In 1889 the same practice, now Austin, Paley and Austin, added a new nave roof, and altered the west elevation. Architecture Holy Trinity has a three-bay nave, each bay containing a triple lancet window. At the west end are four lancets, one on each side and two over the entrance.

The unit was composed mainly of militia units called to service by Colonel Solon F. Borland in response to an anticipated invasion of Northeast Arkansas in the fall of 1861.  Organization  The 1st Arkansas Regiment, 30-Day Volunteers (infantry), was formally organized on November 23, 1861, which is the date of the appointments of the field and staff officers—under command of Colonel James Haywood McCaleb. Col. McCaleb was the commander of the 25th Militia Regiment, from Lawrence County, Arkansas. It appears that several of the companies that composed the new \\"30 Day Volunteer\\" regiment originated as part of the 25th Militia Regiment: *Company A – Capt. A. G. Kelsey — Randolph and Lawrence counties. This company was presumably organized in Randolph county, Arkansas, by Captain A. G. Kelsey. The company enlisted for 30 days on November 18, 1861, and was discharged on December 18, 1861, at Camp Borland, near Pocahontas, Arkansas. This company's records are in the poorest shape of any of the companies of the regiment. The orderly sergeant had extremely poor handwriting and in most cases entered only initials in lieu of first names. This makes it difficult to verify the identities of most of the men; however, those who can be identified seem to be mostly from Randolph and neighboring Lawrence counties. It must have been a local company, because no authorization was made for payment of transportation to their homes. Endorsement on Company A muster roll—\\"Muster Roll of Capt. A. G.

A.) *Surgeon H. W. Vaughs, *Sergeant-Major T. A. Baxter, *Drum Major James J. Vest, (appointed from Co. G.) *Wagonmaster Simon Peter Hurn,(appointed from Co. D.) *Assistant Wagonmaster James Johnston,  Background  Solon F. Borland served in the Arkansas Regiment of Mounted Volunteers during the Mexican War; he served as the Adjutant General and a United States Senator before the Civil War In May 1861, Pocahontas and the nearby strategically important Pitman's Ferry, in Randolph County, became an important Confederate military depot. Following the transfer of the State Troop regiments to Brig. Gen Hardee, virtually all the regiments stationed in northeast Arkansas were transferred in late September east of the Mississippi River to Bowling Green, Kentucky. Col. Solon Borland was left in command of a small force at Pitman's Ferry. Col. Borland's force was the only defense left in Northeast Arkansas. The forces included: Borland's own cavalry regiment of seven companies, Col. McCown's five companies of infantry, Maj. Desha's four companies of raw troops, Capt. Robert's artillery unit of 60 men but no guns and about 150 recruits brought by Maj. McCray – altogether about 1,286 men. But of these, owing to sickness and casualties Col Borland said he could count on no more than 600 for fighting service, and all were \\"raw, inexperienced, poorly disciplined and indifferently armed.\\" A second round of recruiting for new regiments was just getting underway when Col. Borland began receiving reports of enemy movements in Missouri. The initial reports seemed to indicate a possible movement on Pitman's Ferry. The Union army was massing troops in southeast Missouri mainly for the purpose of a thrust down the Mississippi River. But this posed a very real threat to all areas of northeast Arkansas. Col Borland indicated that he had reliable information \\"that there are 300 infantry and 150 cavalry at Rives' Station, on Black River, north of Pitman's Ferry Also that there is a strong infantry force-7,000-at Greenville, north of Rives' Station.\\" Borland was maintaining a regular correspondence with Brig Gen. M. Jeff Thompson, of the Missouri State Guard, who commanded the First Military District of Missouri at Bloomfield, Missouri. Reports of these Union troop movements were sent to area militia units. The Jacksonport Herald of October 26, 1861, published a communication received by Christopher W. Board, Commander of the 34th Militia Regiment of Jackson County. Col. Borland moved his command from Pitman's Ferry to Pocahontas and was sufficiently alarmed over the reports to issue a call for reinforcements from the militia. On November 5, 1861, Col. Borland issued an appeal for volunteers in the surrounding counties to hastily organize companies for the defense of Pitman's Ferry until new regular Confederate regiments could be organized and dispatched. When news of Borland's situation reached Little Rock, the state Military Board responded to Borland's call for aid by calling out the 8th Militia Brigade under the command of Brig. Gen. Phillips: Brig. Gen. Theodore H. Phillips offered his services to Col. Borland, who welcomed his aid in the emergency. Phillips undertook the organization of the new 30 day volunteer companies into a brigade. He placed a requisition for camp equipment as follows:\\" Brig. Gen Phillips added his explanation for the requisition: \\"In response to Col. Borland's call for militia service for 30 days. We have responded and entered service. [with] Capt. Ruffner.\\" The receipt was dated Pocahontas November 23. 1861, and was signed by \\"T. H. Phillips, Brig. Gen. 8th Brigade of Arkansas Militia.\\" Col. Borland's call received an almost immediate response, but he continued to harbor serious misgivings about his situation. On November 10, he wrote to Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, C.S.A., commanding the 1st Division Western Department, at Columbus, Kentucky, and told of his call for reinforcements from the militia. He said the response was \\"somewhat tumultuous.\\" On November 9, 1,000 men had arrived unorganized and so ill-supplied with arms that be deemed it best to direct them to return home. They followed this direction and assured Borland that within a week's time he would have at least 3,000 men at his command. He told them that companies thus organized and prepared would be received into service for 30 days from the time they reported again to him. Borland added a postscript to this letter, saying that he had just received a report from his scouts that a Federal force of 7,450 was between Reeve's Station and Greenville in Missouri. He told Gen. Polk that the force he had was wholly insufficient for either attack or defense. It should be three times as large or be abandoned altogether; and finally he asked to be relieved of his command. \\"It is a Brigadier's command, and should have his responsibility, which I am daily growing more and more distrustful of my competency to sustain. Public interests here would be better provided for by other and abler hands.\\" News of Borland's call for volunteers and the resulting convergence upon Pocahontas was of course reported to other parts of the state. The Arkansas True Democrat of November 14 printed a dispatch from Des Arc dated November 9, 11:00pm: Some two dozen of these emergency companies were organized in Greene, Independence, Izard, Jackson, Lawrence and Randolph counties, including the areas now encompassed in present-day Clay, Cleburne, Sharp and Woodruff counties. They converged on Pocahontas and Pitman's Ferry, beginning about November 9, and were mustered into Confederate service for a period of thirty days. Few records of these hastily organized and short-lived companies have survived.

He touted ARC Energy in his speech at Nashua North High School later that same day, \\"That is why jobs will be our number one focus in 2010. And we’re going to start where most new jobs do – with small businesses. These are the companies that begin in basements and garages when an entrepreneur takes a chance on his dream, or a worker decides it’s time she became her own boss. They’re companies like ARC Energy, which I visited earlier today. These folks are hard at work on a new manufacturing process for ultra-efficient LED lights that will make them affordable for ordinary people. The technology they’ve created is the only of its kind in the world. They’re this little business in a condo out on Amherst Street, and they have the potential to revolutionize an industry.

From the time of President Obama's visit to Gary Locke's visit ARC Energy signed several hundred million dollars worth of contracts and expanded its workforce over 300 percent. In August 2015, ARC Energy became the first company to report repeatable growth of 300 kilogram Sapphire single crystals, having produced the first 300 kg crystal in April 2015, followed by the second one in July 2015 following the same semi- automated and repeatable process parameters. Operations ARC Energy developed a sapphire crystal “c-axis” growth technology specifically for LED applications, called CHES (Controlled Heat Extraction System).CHES Furnaces enable substrate manufacturers to produce large diameter (4”, 6”, 8”, 10” and larger), LED-quality sapphire for mass production.

India recognised South Sudan on 9 July 2011, the day South Sudan became an independent state. India maintains an embassy at Juba, and South Sudan maintains an embassy in New Delhi. History India remained neutral during the First Sudanese Civil War (1962-72) and the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005). The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was established at the end of the First Civil War. Indian President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed visited the region in December 1975, and addressed the Regional Peoples' Assembly in Juba. According to the Embassy of India in Khartoum, \\"On the whole, the visit to Juba made it evident that the Southern Sudanese have deeper respect for India.\\" Indian engagement with South Sudan increased after the end of the Second Civil War. Then Indian Minister of State for External Affairs E.A. Ahamed attended the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement on 9 January 2005 in Nairobi. From 2006, India began inviting South Sudanese citizens for training and exchange programmes in India. India opened a consulate in Juba in August 2007. India formally recognized South Sudan on 9 July 2011, the day it declared independence, and Vice President Mohammad Hamid Ansari attended the country's independence day celebrations in Juba. In a letter to South Sudanese President Salva Kiir, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote, \\"India stands ready to share its development experience and extend whatever assistance possible to South Sudan. I am confident that our co-operation will grow from strength to strength in the coming days for the mutual benefit of our two peoples.\\" The Indian government has stated that it was willing to assist in developing infrastructure, training officials in health, education and rural development. A Foreign Ministry official stated, \\"We have compiled a definite road map using (sic) which India can help South Sudan.\\" The Consulate General in Juba was upgraded to an embassy in March 2012. President Salva Kiir attended the Third India Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in October 2015, and also held a bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the first state visit by a South Sudanese President to India.  Economic relations  Pramit Pal Chaudhuri wrote in the Hindustan Times that South Sudan \\"has other attractions. As the Indian Foreign Ministry's own literature notes, South Sudan [is] 'reported to has (sic) some of the largest oil reserves in Africa outside Nigeria and Angola.\\" An article in 'The Telegraph' noted that South Sudan is \\"one of the poorest [countries] in the world, [but] is oil rich. Foreign ministry officials said New Delhi has [a] keen interest in increasing its investments in the oil fields in South Sudan, which now owns over two- thirds of the erstwhile united Sudan's oil fields.\\" Bilateral trade between the two countries is limited, and precise statistics are not available as most of the trade is conducted through third countries such as Kenya and the United Arab Emirates. The main commodities exported from India to South Sudan are consumer and household goods, food items, pharmaceuticals, motorcycles and three-wheelers. The main commodities India imports from South Sudan are oil and timber. Between 2003 and 2015, ONGC Videsh Ltd. invested a total US$ 2.5 billion in the oil industries of Sudan and South Sudan. Indian peacekeepers As of January 2016, two battalions of the Indian Army, or 2,000 personnel, are deployed in Jonglei and Upper Nile, South Sudan's two largest states, as part of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). 37 Indian Police officers are also present in the country training the South Sudan National Police Service. Indian civilians are also present as part of UNMISS. The Indian Army battalions have also been involved in community activities such as conducting medical camps, donating books to educational institutions, and building roads. One senior Indian Army officer and four soldiers were killed, and four Indian soldiers were injured on 9 April 2013, when a contingent of 36 Indian soldiers escorting a United Nations convoy from Pibor to Bor in Jonglei state was attacked by rebels. Two more Indian soldiers were killed in an attack on the UN Base at Akobo, Jonglei State on 19 December 2013, and another two soldiers were injured during an attack on the UN Base at Bor, Jonglei State in April 2014. Indian foreign aid India pledged US$ 5 million for the construction of a hospital in South Sudan at the April 2005 Oslo Donors Conference. India donated US$100,000 worth of tents and medicines to both Sudan and South Sudan for flood relief efforts in January 2008. To boost South Sudan's almost non-existent power generation infrastructure, India's Central Electronics Limited completed a solar electrification project near Juba in 2011. In February 2012, India and South Sudan signed an agreement to include the latter in the Pan African e-Network Project. State-owned ONGC Videsh Ltd. donated 1,000 artificial limbs (Jaipur foot) to disabled veterans of South Sudan's armed forces in 2014. The Indian government has also offered to establish a vocational training centre, a rural technology park and an agricultural seed production and development centre in South Sudan. India is a major destination for South Sudanese patients seeking medical treatment. Citizens of South Sudan are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Indians in South Sudan Most of the Indian community in South Sudan migrated north to Sudan following the outbreak of the Second Civil War in 1983. As of January 2016, 700 Indian citizens reside in South Sudan. Some are business owners in Juba. Indians own and operate hotels, borehole companies, printing presses and department stores. The community was among the first to establish such businesses in South Sudan beginning in early 2006. Some Indian citizens are employed by various companies in the country, and a small number are Christian missionaries. There are also 2,000 Indian Army peacekeepers, 37 police officers and several civilian officials attached to UNMISS resident in South Sudan as of January 2016.

Following his discharge from the U.S. Army in 1946, he secured a position designing books for the Adjutant General's Office and subsequently worked as a designer for the Civil Aeronautics Bureau. While residing in Madison, Wisconsin, he designed numerous University of Wisconsin bulletins, brochures, exhibition catalogs as well as publications, posters, calendars and items related to the 1948 Wisconsin Centennial for the Wisconsin Historical Society. Anderson also established a relationship with the Holt Rinehart and Company while designing and providing many of the illustrations for a 1958 psychology text, The Behavior of Man. After receiving his graduate degree in 1941, Anderson taught briefly at Iowa and then at Duluth State College before moving to Washington, D.C. In the fall of 1947 he accepted a full-time position in the Department of Art at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During the next thirty-five years, Anderson taught popular design, lettering, typography, calligraphy and watercolor painting courses until he retired in December 1982. Within a year of joining the faculty in the Department of Art at UW-Madison, Anderson gained considerable recognition for his paintings, was included in many invitational exhibitions and in competitive painting shows was a frequent award winner. Known for his exquisite watercolor paintings that demonstrate an intimate knowledge of traditional techniques as well as research and experiments with new materials and concepts, Anderson also excelled at mixed media drawings and employed a variety of materials, including found objects, when producing collages assembled on sturdy wood backings.  Jazz Enthusiast  Don began listening to jazz records while still in high school and started drawing jazz musicians at the University of Iowa, where he often attended jam sessions and played trombone in a college band. During the 1940s, Anderson also served as the staff artist and designed many of the covers for The Record Changer magazine, often signing them with his initials, DMA. Anderson continued to produce jazz-inspired drawings, mixed-media pieces and in 1960 undertook a major jazz project that extended over a two-year period. After spending over three years completing his Elements of Design textbook, he purchased one hundred 24 x 38-inch blotters, which according to Anderson, he “attacked … with brush and ink in a series of duels that lasted two years.” He later issued a portfolio containing twenty-five smaller versions of the famous jazz musicians depicted in his original large drawings in an edition of fifty. The original jazz drawings Anderson produced from 1960 through 1978 were displayed in an exhibition mounted at the Grace Chosy Gallery in Madison, Wisconsin in 1992.  Publications  Donald M. Anderson authored two highly regarded textbooks. At the request of the publisher, he wrote and designed the Elements of Design (1961), a popular text used for decades in basic design courses around the country that sold over 85,000 copies. His The Art of Written Forms (1969), another popular book also published by Henry Holt and Company, served as both a college text and also appealed to a much wider audience. The second book was reissued in 1992 as Calligraphy: The Art of Written Forms. Anderson also collaborated with academic colleagues on several limited edition ventures issued under the imprint Meles Vulgaris Press that received national awards. These included Il Perfetto Scrittore, Parte Seconda, by Giovan Francesco Cresci, which was later published by the University of Wisconsin Press as A Renaissance Alphabet, as well as The Trajan Letters, De Caratteri Di Leopardo Antonozzi, Libro Primo. A limited edition, boxed volume titled Have Wrench/Will Monkey featured illustrations of tools and wrenches arranged in humorous positions that suggested living creatures.  Awards  Starting in 1948 and during the next fifteen years, Donald Anderson's paintings were exhibited frequently in the Midwest, and he received about forty regional and national awards. In 1948 he won two large awards: one for his entry in the Wisconsin Centennial Exhibition, judged by Ben Shahn, and another at the Northwest Territory Exhibition in Springfield, Illinois. Anderson frequently participated in the Wisconsin Painters and Sculptors and Wisconsin Salon exhibitions, and in 1951 won a Gimbels purchase award for a painting titled “City at Night.” It was featured at the Milwaukee Art Museum and later reproduced as a two-page spread in the January 14, 1952 issue of Life magazine. In 1959, Anderson received two design awards: one for his jacket cover for a University of Wisconsin Press book, On Numerical Approximation, and one of his full-color illustrations for The Behavior of Man was featured in Illustration ’59. In 1974, his limited edition Meles Vulgaris books were displayed at the Grolier Club in New York and were included in the American Institute of Graphic Art's Fifty Best Books in 1976 and 1977. His books also received awards from the Society of Typographic Arts in 1971, from the Chicago Book Clinic in 1973 and the Type Directors Club of New York in 1973 and 1979. Numerous libraries have acquired copies of Anderson's limited edition books. These include: The Newberry, the Vatican, the Smithsonian, Cooper Hewitt, the New York Public, Yale University, the University of Texas, the Lily at the Indiana University and the Kohler at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Examples of Anderson's paintings and drawings are included in the following collections: the Cooper Hewitt Museum (New York City), the University of Iowa Museum of Art (Iowa City), as well as the Chasen Museum of Art (the University of Wisconsin-Madison), the Milwaukee Art Museum (Milwaukee) and the Museum of Wisconsin Art (West Bend, Wisconsin). The Newberry Library in Chicago acquired most of the personal papers and manuscripts of this widely recognized authority and skilled practitioner in the fields of typography and calligraphy. The Donald M. Anderson collection is housed in the Roger and Julie Baskes Department of Special Collections at the Newberry.  Death and legacy  Donald died at age 79 on September 5, 1995. Donald M. Anderson bequeathed his entire estate to a foundation bearing his name, the designated beneficiary of which was design education in the Department of Art at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In recognition of Anderson's generous contribution, two classrooms in the Humanities Building on that campus have been designated as the Donald M. Anderson Design Research Laboratory. The Anderson foundation's annual dispersements have funded lab equipment, undergraduate design scholarships as well as graduate design fellowships.

Early life and education Sehnaoui was born in Beirut, to parents Maurice Sehnaoui and Mouna Bustros, on 23 April 1967 and grew in the Achrafieh a Beirut neighborhood. He attended Grand Lycee Franco-Libanais following which he earned a BA in Economics from Panthéon-Assas University and an MBA from ESA Beirut. Career In 2000, Sehnaoui became chairman of the board of Sogecap, a leading life insurance company and in 2004, chairman of the board of Sogelease Liban a financial leasing firm. He held both positions until early 2008. Since 1996, he has been a board member of Sehnaoui Plant a regional construction equipment distribution company. Sehnaoui served as the Minister of Telecommunications of the Republic of Lebanon between June 2011 and February 2014. Under his leadership, the Ministry of Telecommunications (1) upgraded antiquated copper backbone to fiber optics and DWDM latest technologies with plans ready for FTTC and FTTB, (2) replaced ancient EDGE cellular networks with 3G across the country and 50 Mbit/s 4G LTE in greater Beirut, (3) and increased Lebanon's international bandwidth tenfold via IMEWE whilst securing redundancy through participation in the Alexandros submarine cable; all while reducing internet & mobile costs by over 80%. By June 2013, with the infrastructure well on its way to recovery, Sehnaoui turned his attention to Lebanon's knowledge economy, more specifically its digital economy: he created Beirut Angels – Lebanon's 1st tech startup angel network – and actively supported the creation of Banque du Liban Circular 331 – a groundbreaking US$400 million equity investment guarantee initiative that transformed Lebanon's banks into VC-oriented institutions. Sehnaoui is now leading Lebanon's Digital Roadmap Steering Committee to ensure the successful implementation of BDL C331. All these efforts where measured & confirmed by the United Nations International Telecommunication Union that ranked Lebanon 1st in progress out of 157 countries in the 2012 ICT Development Index (IDI).ICT Development Index Report Prior to taking office, Sehnaoui successfully managed several companies across a variety of industries. Sehnaoui is a strong advocate of a secular political system although his rhetoric has been described as highly sectarian. Beginning in 2011 and under Sehnaoui's management, Lebanon has witnessed significant infrastructure upgrade investments, mainly, deployment of a 4,700 km fiber-optic network linking all telecom exchanges, purchase of 25% of the Alexandros submarine cable capacity (multiplying Lebanon's international capacity 14-fold), launch of both 3G and 4G mobiles networks and a major increase of Internet speeds (15-fold for the fixed network with an ~80% price decrease and 18-fold for the mobile network with a ~88% price decrease). In 2011, Lebanon was included among 10 countries that witnessed the greatest rank improvement according to the IDI moving up three spots globally and ranking sixth regionally.ICT Development Index In 2018, Nicolas Sehnaoui was elected as Member of Parliament for the Beirut I District.

It follows the story of Wendy Everly as she meets Finn Holmes, who informs her of her inherited royal status and true identity as a member of the Trylle. Background Switched was first self-published as an eBook by author Amanda Hocking in early 2010, and was published in paperback by St. Martin's Press on January 24, 2012. Her failing to initially get published through traditional book publishers was an advantage because \\"it allowed me to put a lot of books on the market quickly, so if people liked them, they could immediately buy another\\" ... so the first of a trilogy, Switched, sold 50 eBooks the first month and increased rapidly reaching almost a million copies. This was \\"the most spectacular example of an author striking gold through ebooks.\\" Plot summary In the prologue, Wendy recounts her sixth birthday party. At the party, she expresses contempt at the gifts of fragile porcelain dolls and throws a tantrum after being presented with a chocolate birthday cake, which she does not like. After which, Wendy's mother claims that she is not her daughter and attempts to take Wendy's life with a large kitchen knife, but is stopped by Wendy's brother Matt. Eleven years later, Wendy is living with her brother and her aunt Maggie, who assumed guardianship after her mother was placed in a mental institution. After difficulties at previous schools, Wendy had just transferred to a new high school when she meets Finn, another new student, who asks her to a school dance. At the dance, Finn makes some rude comments to Wendy which angers her, and prompts her to want to leave. She approaches another student and gets him to take her home through a \\"persuasive\\" ability by looking in his eyes and telling him what she wants. When Wendy performs this ability in front of Finn, he becomes alarmed. Later that night, Finn comes to her bedroom window and tells her that she is a changeling and that he is here to bring her back to her biological family. He tells her that her ability to \\"persuade\\" people is because she is Trylle. At first Wendy does not believe Finn, but then she recounts the differences between herself and her family. She uses her persuasive ability to get her brother Matt to drive her to the mental institution to visit her mother, Kim, who advises she still doesn't believe that she is her child. Kim states that the doctor told her that she was pregnant with a boy which is one of the reasons she doesn't believe Wendy is her child. After the visit Wendy starts to consider that she may be a changeling. One morning, she decides to take a walk to consider the implications of what Finn told her when she is attacked by two trackers from a rival Trylle band. Finn rescues her from her attack but tells her that she is not safe. Wendy leaves with Finn and they head to a gated and protected community in Minnesota called Forening. There Wendy meets her biological mother, Queen Elora, who is aloof and distant with her. Wendy learns she is a princess and will become queen of this community upon Queen Elora's death. She also meets Rhys, who is a mansklig, which is the human child that is taken when the Trylle offspring is left behind. She learns that Trylle have various supernatural abilities at various strengths and she starts instruction on learning to develop and control her ability. Wendy is invited to sit in on royal meetings with high ranked members of the community, with results that Elora shows displeasure with because Wendy does not understand Trylle protocol. Wendy also gets the sense that there some background information that is being withheld. Whilst wandering the Palace for more information, Wendy breaks into a locked room stocked with many undisplayed paintings. Finn finds her and tells her that Elora's Trylle power is of precognition that she can only express through painting. Finn tells her of the societal rules of the Trylle; whilst the Princess, Queens and Marksinna (nobles) are the highest, the Trackers and mänsklig are considered even lower than the peasantry. Finn begins to tutor her in the history and etiquette of the Trylle so that Wendy can properly handle her future role as Queen and not embarrass Elora. He warns Wendy that she cannot become involved with Rhys past a platonic level as it would \\"corrupt\\" the bloodline of the royalty, and the strong powers held by the royals would cease to exist. An introductory ball is scheduled to be held in Wendy's honour. Elora tells Wendy that she will be choosing a more appropriate name for her Trylle life. Wendy says that she does not want to and will not, much to Elora's annoyance. Elora speaks with Finn and he resigns. Wendy finds him before he goes and the two share a kiss. Finn says that he cannot allow her to proceed. At Wendy's ball, the Vittra attack, forcing the Trylle that possess helpful powers to retaliate. During the fight Jen, the Vittra tracker who had previously attacked Wendy when trying to kidnap her, rounds on her, knocking Rhys unconscious in the process. Finn returns, almost losing his life to aid the princess. Tove, a young Markis, uses psychokinesis to save Finn's life and successfully get rid of Jen. Elora and the other Trylle manage to quell the Vittra threat. Finn and Wendy reunite, until Elora informs Wendy that Finn has left, having been transferred once more. Wendy reacts angrily and uses her persuasive powers on Rhys to get him to drive her back to Matt and Maggie.  Characters  Wendy :Narrator of the series. The Trylle \\"Princess\\".

Photo during screening cinema French Film Festival UK 2014  History   The Festival debut  The festival began during Britain's presidency of the EC and was one of the artistic events initiated when Edinburgh hosted the Euro-summit in 1992. It was created on the initiative of two film journalists Richard Mowe and Allan Hunter who ran the festival in tandem for a number of years. Hunter now has relinquished the reins to concentrate on other activities, including the Glasgow Film Festival and the Italian Film Festival UK, both of which he is a co-director. Mowe is now director of the French Film Festival UK, co-director of the Italian Film Festival UK and director of the distribution company CinéFile as well as continuing his journalistic activities. Ilona Morison now has joined the FFF UK team as deputy director.  Year by year   1992  It was the year of Josiane Balasko, Gérard Jugnot, Indochine, Madame Bovary and then newcomer Arnaud Desplechin's La Vie des morts. The Air France photographic archive was on show.  1993  Jean Reno's mega-hit time-travelling comedy Les Visiteurs hit these shores to great success although the Festival would have to wait a few years for Reno himself to appear. Instead actor Christine Bujeau appeared in his place. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau came and conquered with Cyrano de Bergerac and other films in his canon; there was Bertrand Blier's Un, deux, trois soleil; Coline Serreau's La Crise (including a special screening and dinner in the Royal Museum of Scotland for sponsors Paribas) and a special focus on Claude Chabrol. The festival introduced Cédric Klapisch to the British public with Riens du tout. A link was forged with the Brest European Short Film Festival ensuring a selection of new French short films. Jeanne Moreau and Claude Sautet sent messages of support.  1994  The Festival have brought Michel Deville and Aux petits bonheurs, Gérard Jugnot back again this time with Casque Bleu; The César winning Tonie Marshall was discovered with Pas très catholique as well as Philippe Lioret and his audience award-winner Tombés du ciel. Antoine Desrosières, a young directorial Turk, brought his youthful protagonists Mathieu Demy and Aurélie Thierrée and A la belle étoile. The Harcourt Studio's photographic archives were on show.  1995  It was the year of Mathieu Kassovitz whom we introduced to the UK long before La Haine thrust him into the spotlight; Claude Lelouch was among the guests with Alessandra Martines; Josiane Balasko appeared on screen with Gazon Maudit; Hervé Palud and Louis Becker accompanied Un indien dans la ville and a test audience of youngsters gave their verdicts on dubbed and subtitled versions. Marion Vernoux was another discovery for Personne ne m'aime. Bernard Stora won the audience award for Consentement Mutuel and Patrick Braoudé enchanted with the original Neuf mois. We celebrated 100 years of Gaumont in a poster show.  1996  The grande dame of French cinema, Agnès Varda received a retrospective in her honour and in her presence. Patrice Leconte launched Les grands ducs. Gabriel Aghion camped it up with Pédale douce … Michel Serrault and Carmen Maura discovered Le bonheur est dans le pré and pupils went to school with Le maître des éléphants with special screenings for teachers and their charges. Abel Gance's monumental La Roue featured a live score by Adrian Johnston. A restored copy of Jour de fête gave Jacques Tati a new lease of life. Didier Bourdon clowned around in Les trois frères and in person. And there were new films from Pascale Ferran, Agnès Merlet and Tonie Marshall.  1997  The real-life Lucie Aubrac made a heart-rending appearance in support of Claude Berri's Resistance epic. Bernard Giraudeau presented his breathtaking Les caprices d'un fleuve and screenwriter Éric Assous discussed his scripts for La femme défendu and Les Randonnneurs. We discovered Robert Guédiguian long before Marius et Jeanette with A la vie, à la mort – and on screen there was Godard, Kassovitz and Klapisch, Michel Piccoli made his directorial debut, Alain Chabat showed dogged determination with Didier and Philippe Muyl's Tout doît disparaître. Jan Kounen delivered Dobermann while Pascale Ferran and Pierre Trividic presented Petit arrangements avec les morts.  1998  Claude and Annie Miller presented La classe de neige and other landmark films including La meilleure façon de marcher, Garde à vue, Le Sourire, and L'éffrontée. Antoine de Caunes showed his serious side in L'homme est une femme comme les autres and was present with actress Elsa Zylberstein. Patrice Chéreau also took the plane to talk about Ceux qui m'aiment prendront le train. The classic choice of René Clair's Un chapeau de paille d'italie was accompanied by a live score by Ramond Alessandrini. Patrice Leconte launched Une chance sur deux at its London premiere and Betrand Tavernier made a lasting impression with Capitaine Conan. Francis Veber caused ripples of laughter with Le dîner de cons, subsequently a huge box office hit. Danièle Doubroux tantalised with Le journal du séducteur – and there were startling debuts by Jean-François Richet (Ma 6T va crack-er), Sébastien Lifshitz with Les corps ouverts, Olivier Dahan with Déjà mort and Laurent Bouhnik with Zonzon. Claude Duty brought his shorts.  1999  Time to vive la différence: women film-makers were ready for their close-ups, among them Anne Fontaine, Valérie Lemercier, Brigitte Rouan, Diane Kurys and Danièle Dubroux – all were guests except Kurys. Jean Renoir's La carrosse d'or gleamed anew in a restored print. Michel Deville returned to form with La maladie de Sachs and first film talents included Smadi Wolfman, director Olivier Péray and producer David Kodsi (all guests) with Petits désordres amoureux as well as Stéphane Brizé, Didier Le Pêcheur and Christine Carrière. Alain Beigel (guest) revealed the talents of Emma de Caunes in Milles bornes – and accompanied his first feature, one of the year's most refreshing debuts.  2000  Bertrand Blier gathered together a who's who of French stars for Les acteurs and came to talk about them. We took a special look at les thrillers with such acclaimed titles as: Scènes de crimes (Frédéric Schoendoerffer) with Charles Berling, and André Dussollier; Le cousin (Alain Corneau) starring Alain Chabat, Patrick Timsit, and Marie Trintignant; Au coeur du mensonge / The Colour of Lies (Claude Chabrol) starring Jacques Gamblin, Sandrine Bonnaire, Antoine de Caunes and Valéria Bruni-Tedeschi; Total Western / The Hunted Man (guest Eric Rochant) starring Samuel Le Bihan, Jean-François Stévenin and Jean-Pierre Kalfon; as well as Une affaire du goût / A tasteful affair (Bernard Rapp) introduced by actor Jean-Pierre Lorît.

Là-bas … mon pays / Over There … My Country (Alexandre Arcady) took a fresh look at Algeria with Antoine de Caunes playing a celebrated television journalist while Le vache et le président (Philippe Muyl, also a guest) proved a delightful film for young people about a boy's bid to save his favourite cow and was scene by thousands of school children. Other guest included Anne Villaceque for Petite Cherie, and Sabine Franel for Le premier du nom. A new company CinéFrance was established to continue the pioneering work of the festival throughout the year, and to date has released successfully Au coeur du mensonge and La vache et le président with more titles pending.  2001  The return of Josiane Balasko for Un crime au paradis; Jean-Pierre Salomé for Belphégor; Claude Miller for Betty Fisher; Thierry Lhermitte for Le prince du pacifique; Lucy Russell for L'anglaise et le duc; Thomas Gilou for La vérité 1 and 2; Mehdi Charef for Marie-Line; Fabrice Genestal for La Squale; Yves Lavandier for Oui mais … and Anne-Sophie Birot and Islid Lo Besco for Les filles ne savent pas nager; Christian Carion for Une hirondelle a fait le printemps and Pierre- Olivier Scotto and Thierry de Ganay for Le roman de Lulu.

In Glasgow the Corneau retrospective found a home at the CCA, adding yet another venue to the line-up while the Ciné Lumière devoted a weekend to the retro. In Edinburgh and Glasgow, the festival's founding cities, the response to the overall programme which embraced work by Claude Miller, Claude Chabrol, Jean Becker, Raoul Ruiz, Philippe Muyle, Jeanne Labrune, Michel Deville, Robert Guédiguian and Danièle Thompson among many, proved pleasingly buoyant and maintained the growing momentum seen over the last couple of years. Stirling Macrobert were cautiously upbeat about the participation on four titles. Sidebar activity included the stunning exhibition of photographs by Nicolas Guerin, a photographer who works for Positif, shown at the French Institute in Edinburgh and on the walls of GFT's Café Cosmo; a round table on literary adaptations in the cinema featuring Franco-Scottish input from Bernard MacLaverty, Alain Corneau and Leslie Hills at the French Institute where additional attractions included a programme of documentaries on writers as well as four portraits of directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Claire Denis, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Robert Guédiguian. Again the level of activity built on initiatives started in previous years. One of the resounding causes for optimism was the positive reaction to the educational programme (Moi César, Le Papillon and Vivre me tue) which proved popular with pupils, students and teachers. The strong opening weekend (and closing at London Ciné Lumière) with many guests in attendance including Alain Corneau, Nadine Trintingnant, Jean Veber, Nicolas Vannier, and Nicolas Guerin, ensured that the festival had a vibrant send-off and produced vibes that resonated over the days ahead. Distribution of guests ensured that Dundee (Jean and Louis Becker) and Aberdeen (Thomas Chabrol) shared in the bounty.  2004  The star appearance in Glasgow of Jean Reno, created a storm of interest. Guests appeared variously in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh and included Gael Morel for Le Clan, Dominique Cabrera for Folle embellie, Abelllatif Kechiche for L'esquive, and Emmanuel Mouret for Venus et fleur. Consul general Pierre Antoine-Berniard hosted an agreeable brunch at his residence and guests of honour included director Gael Morel, Unifrance's Antoine Khalife, Sylvain and Sally Chomet, Scottish director Richard Jobson, Palme Dog promoter Toby Rose and others including the French Institute's Olga Poivre d'Arvor. Education events surrounded Les choristes, Malabar Princess, Genesis and Raining Cats and Frogs. Special teaching packs were devised by Glasgow Film Theatre's learning team in collaboration with local authorities. Such events are becoming an increasingly important of FFF activities, with teachers demonstrating an unprecedented demand and interest. The tribute to Alain Delon whose image adorned the cover of the brochure, drummed up a strong following for La Piscine, Mr Klein and Melodie en sous sol.  2005  There was a mini-celebration of le cinema francais to enable the French Film Festival UK to change calendar dates and to join forces in 2006 with the Renault French Film Season to become an all-encompassing showcase for French cinema in the UK. Titles presented comprised: Afiter You / Après vous; Just Friends / je préfère qu’on reste amis; The Art of Breaking Up / Un fil a la patte and The Ax / Le Couperet. Sadly the collaboration was short-lived and in 2007 the Festival regained its traditional November slot.  2006  The year of the collaboration with the Renault French Film Season. The Panorama section of the Festival was devoted to titles featuring such big name stars as Carole Bouquet, Sandrine Bonnaire, Sabine Azéma, and, from the younger generation, Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou. Themes range from school rebellion (Bad Spelling, to be released by CineFile), a right royal romp which has already had considerable coverage over here (Palais Royal!, Momentum Pictures) and 1968 revolutionary fervour (Regular Lovers, Artificial Eye). Cutting-edge, new talent is celebrated in the Discovery section. Xavier Giannoli's An Adventure (Momentum Pictures) depicts a strange psychological encounter between Ludivine Sagnier and Nicolas Duvauchelle, while Mon Ange (Parasol Peccadillo) features Vanessa Paradis in her first screen role for six years, playing a hooker with a heart of gold who suddenly finds her world turned upside down. Master Classes, open to all, were scheduled with Bertrand Tavernier, the subject of the 2006 retrospective. As someone who has carved his own unique niche in French cinema as a dedicated cinéphile, producer, script-writer, and director, Tavernier has won countless international awards for his work which will be discussed at public events in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee. He will also present his latest film Holy Lola with Jacques Gamblin and Isabelle Carré plus the cult hit Death Watch, made in Glasgow with Romy Schneider and Harvey Keitel. The festival is presided over by honorary patron Sylvain Chomet, the Oscar-nominated creator of Belleville Rendez-vous currently working on this side of the Channel – another example of Franco-British fusion in action. There were three launches – in Edinburgh (Cockles and Muscles with Jacques Martineau and Olivier Ducastel), Glasgow (Lemming with Dominik Moll) and London (Le Temps qui reste) with Melvil Poupaud. Russian Dolls had its London bow at the Cineworld Shaftesbury Avenue followed by Bertrand Tavernier's masterclass and screening of Holy Lola. The delegation comprised, among others, Marie Gillain, Melvil Poupaud, Dominik Moll, Cédric Klapisch, Olivier Marchal, Bertrand Tavernier, Olivier Ducastel, Jacques Martineau, Edouard Colin, as well as Jacques Bonnaffé and Aisa Maiga (the latter low profile pair had least to contribute to the proceedings being secondary characters in their respective films Cockles and Russian Dolls).  2007  After a year of close collaboration with Unifrance and the showcase in London designed to promote films with UK distribution in place, it was agreed that the two events should regain their separate identities in 2007. The policy change within Unifrance was communicated relatively late in the planning of the FFF UK 2007 leaving the 15th edition of the festival locked in to dates from 15 April to 6 May (not necessarily the ideal timeframe) while the Rendezvous ran earlier from 29 March to 1 April and was based only in London. The FFF UK welcomed a range of guests including Christian Vincent, the subject of this year's retro. He attended screenings in three cities (London, Edinburgh, Glasgow) as well as taking part in masterclasses at Screen Academy Scotland in Edinburgh and at the Alliance française in Glasgow. Another three- city guest was director Patrick Grandperret who presented his new film Meurtrières / Murderers. Michel Hazanavicius, the director of OSS 117 attended with actress Bérénice Béjo – and took part in two screenings at Filmhouse Edinburgh and Vue Ocean Terminal. Unfortunately they had to cut their Glasgow date because of a funeral in France. The final attendee was Claudie Ossard, one of France's most powerful producers (Amélie / Betty Blue / Delicatessen) who presented her new production Paris je t'aime with FFF UK patron Sylvain Chomet (director of one of the segments). She used the occasion to talk shop with Chomet about their new live-action feature project.  2008  The introduction of a Preview section devoted to showcasing films with UK distribution already in place (as a way of filling the gap left by the demise of the 2008 Unifrance London Rendezvous) also produced dividends. In particular the take-up for Priceless (top performer) and A Secret. The line-up of guests included Lola Doillon attending the openings in Edinburgh and Glasgow with her first film Just About Love, Jean Becker and Jean-Pierre Darroussin supporting Conversations with My Gardener in Scotland and London, and Lebanese film-maker Danielle Arbid in attendance for A Lost Man. Daroussin and also accompanied The Premonition, his first film as a director with actress Valerie Stroh. Lionel Bailliu worked tirelessly at master classes built around his feature Fair Play and his short film Squash at Screen Academy Scotland and Stirling University as well as the Alliance Française in Glasgow. London additionally welcomed Pierre Salvadori, Serge Bozon and Barbara Carlotti, and Damien Odoul. The only guest who failed to appear was Melvil Poupaud, who had to return at the last moment to the States for re-shoots on his new film. Award-winning photographer Fabrizio Maltese appeared in Edinburgh and Glasgow to publicise his exhibition Faces of French Cinema at the Institut franìais. He was accompanied by his editor Boyd van Hoeij.  2009  The 17th edition featured two contrasting tributes to diverse but legendary figures: Jacques Tati and Jean Eustache. A new documentary The Magnificent Tati premiered in Edinburgh and Glasgow, presented by its director Michael House while Tati expert Professor David Bellos from Princeton University introduced all major screenings of Tati's oeuvres. The focus on Jean Eustache, curated by the University of Edinburgh, was presented by Eustache expert Jerome Game and Professor Keith Reader from Glasgow University. Panorama gathered titles featuring the crème de la crème of French stars among them Gérard Depardieu, Nathalie Baye, Josiane Balasko, Catherine Frot, André Dussollier, Gérard Jugnot, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Fabrice Luchini, Chiara Mastroianni, and Emmanuel Mouret as well as a clin d'oeil on novelist Françoise Sagan. The Discovery section, among a wide selection, showcased Guillaume Depardieu's final moving performance and an arresting new Swiss film Another Man whose director Lionel Baier was in attendance with the support of the cultural department of the Swiss Embassy. Director and sailor Pierre Marcel presented his documentary Tabarly (the Gallic master mariner Eric Tabarly). Top French titles due on UK screens later in that year included the Cannes Film Festival award winner A Prophet by Jacques Audiard and Welcome by Philippe Lioret. In addition to regular cities (Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Manchester, Warwick, Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee) we welcomed to the fold Dumfries, Durham, Cambridge, St Andrews and Stirling. The Rhône-Alpes region around Lyon active in film locations, tourism and commerce held a special gala evening as part of the celebration.  2010  The festival welcomed more than 20,000 spectators. An even wider geographical selection was on offer through the addition of the Horizons label, warmly embracing the world of Francophonie and its varied cultures thanks to the input of TV5 Monde. After the memorable Jacques Tati tribute and retrospective in 2009 the festival maintained the link by focussing on the work of Pierre Étaix in his presence and in particular the restored copy of Le grand amour. With his roots in the circus, he helped Tati on many of his films, developed multiple skills and carved his own film career working with everyone from Robert Bresson to Jerry Lewis. A close-up on a key figure in French cinema, André Techiné whose concerns have involved identity, sexuality and roots, was mounted in association with Stirling University's Bill Marshall. The new films cover titles from major directors such as Bertrand Tavernier, Rachid Bouchareb, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Costa-Gavras, to the newer generation of Christophe Honoré, Stephane Brizé, Cédric Kahn, and Zabou Breitman.  2011  Daniel Auteuil supported in person his remake Marcel Pagnol's classic The Well- Digger's Daughter (as actor and director) while Daniel Armogathe, President of the Marseille Cinematheque shared his Pagnol insights at screenings of the film in Edinburgh and Glasgow, part of a delegation from Marseille. Following the previous recent celebrations of Jacques Tati and, in 2010, Pierre Étaix, we saluted in their presence a Belgian burlesque duo in the same tradition Fiona Gordon and Dominique Abel and their Cannes hit The Fairy. The Belgian flag also was flown by Bouli Lanners (The Giants) and Dominique Reding's Robert Mitchum is Dead, all organised by Edouard Notte, lecturer in French language and literature at the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with WBI (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Francophone Community). The opening choice of Romantics Anonymous starring Isabelle Carré and Benoît Poelvoorde was directed by Jean-Pierre Améris who accompanied his film at most screenings. There were documentaries such as Oceans, Special Flight, Think Global and a portrait of Charlotte Rampling (The Look) through animation (Zep's colourful Titeuf and A Cat in Paris) to new works by Alain Cavalier, André Techiné, Philippe Claudel, Danielle Arbid (who accompanied her controversial Beirut Hotel) as well as The Women on the 6th Floor's Philippe Le Guay. Scots actor Jamie Sives demonstrated the Auld Alliance in action and teamed up with director Vincent Vizioz for Temblay-en-France. Classic cinema included Jean Delannoy's collaboration with Jean Cocteau Love Eternal and Fantomas by Louis Feuillade, the first great master of feature-length film- making, accompanied with a live electronic score by two cult Parisian DJs Jean-Yves Leloup and Éric Pajot (aka RadioMentale) in Dundee and The Hippodrome, Bo'ness.  2012  The 20th Anniversary of the festival between 8 November and 2 December in over 12 cities including London, Edinburgh and Paris.coThe guests of the festival were: Chantal Akerman, Pierre Jolivet, Eric Lange, Sophie Lellouche, François Pirot and Noémie Lvovsky with a piano recital by Jason Kouchak held at the ambassadors residence in Paris.

The Horizons panorama made discover films like capital with Gad Elmaleh, or The Man Who Laughs with Gérard Depardieu. The view was also discover a beautiful hilarious movie Me, Myself and Mum featuring the incredible personable actor- director Guillaume Galienne.  2014  This year, the Horizons panorama in the brochure included the hit movie Belle and Sebastian by Nicolas Vanier or he tells the friendship between a boy and a dog, all our strength From Nils Tavernier or man that is loved too with Guillaume Canet by André Téchiné .

Bentley's father began grooming his son for the family business while he was attending Brown University, sending Bentley abroad to study French and business. However, Bentley intended to pursue philosophy and English. He graduated from Brown with a degree in English and Economics, eventually joining his father's business in research and advertising. Bentley was involved with Miehle and its successors, Miehle-Goss-Dexter and Rockwell International, in his capacity as a major stockholder. Bentley married twice: first to Marjorie Drawbaugh in 1936, with whom he had one daughter, Judy, and next to Elizabeth Dyas in 1955. Bentley died in 1994 and was survived by Dyas.

Founded in 1912, it is one of the oldest existing Buddhist temples in the North American mainland region. The temple is a branch of Koyasan Shingon Buddhism and is the North America regional headquarters for the school. History In 1909, the Reverend Shutai Aoyama, native and former chief priest of Kakuganji Temple in Toyama- ken, left Japan for the United States with the blessings of Archbishop Misumon Yuhan and his other superiors, “to observe the religious situation in North America, as well as propagate Shingon Buddhism. In 1912, with support and encouragement from some of the Los Angeles Japanese community’s leading citizens, Issei and Nisei temple members a like, he opened the first Shingon temple in the United States in a store front in Little Tokyo called Koyasan Daishi Kyōkai of Los Angeles or just Daishi Church. The Koyasan Shingon sect of Buddhism focuses on Shingon teachings compiled by Kobo Daishi (Kukai) in the Heian period. In 1935, the Temple was elevated to the status of Koyasan Beikoku Betsuin, meaning it became the North American regional headquarters, recognized by the Koyasan Headquarters of Japan. In 1940, the Temple moved to its current location on East 1st Street, but the bombing of Pearl Harbor would forever changed the Japanese American community across the nation. Anti-Japanese sentiment ran rampant. Within a year, the temple in Los Angeles was closed, its hall and basement piled to the ceiling with members’ possessions, and its membership, both U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike, were relocated to internment camps during World War II. Over the years, the temple began opening cultural and religious programs and classes for the local community. Prior to redevelopment in Little Tokyo in the 1980s, Koyasan served as the main hub of Japanese cultural events. In 1987, the temple hosted the Kechien Kanjo ritual, a service rarely conducted outside Japan. Two years later, the temple was designated the keeper of the Hiroshima Peace Flame, brought over from Japan by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. Starting in 1999, the temple underwent a ten-year renovation of the old facilities to meet with the city building codes; the building was especially retrofitted to fit the needs for the monthly Goma fire ritual service. In 2012, the temple celebrated its centennial anniversary, hosting a special goma fire ritual service presided over by Bishop Ekan Ikeguchi from Kagoshima.  Building  The Aoyama Tree is a 60-by-70 foot Moreton Bay Fig Tree (Ficus macrophylla) located in the city of Los Angeles-owned parking lot next to the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, a component of the Japanese American National Museum. The tree marks the former location of the Koyasan Daishi Church. The first established site was a storefront in 1912 near Elysian Park. In 1920, the temple was moved to a larger building on Central Avenue. A tree was planted in front of the new building by Koyasan Temple members to commemorate the move. The Aoyama Tree is a 60 by 70-foot Moreton Bay Fig tree (Ficus macrophylla) and notable landmark in Little Tokyo was given historical status by the Los Angeles City Council in 2008. However, currently this tree faces a great threat of decades of neglect. After the former temple building was demolished, the tree was left without an irrigation system with the area immediately surrounding the tree was paved over, covering the tree's extensive roots system, denying the tree essential water. The current building consists of a main hall, which measures 60x120 feet, and an annex that measures 40x50 feet. The main hall has a seating capacity of 600 people, and a grand scale altar where the traditional esoteric rituals are performed. The main Buddha in the main hall is Dainichi Nyorai of the Vajradhatu Mandala. There are several other esoteric deities enshrined in the main hall of the temple (Fudo Myoo, Yakushi Nyorai, Jizo, Kannon, and Kobo Daishi). The second floor of the annex has been designed for the purpose of religious gatherings and study classes especially for small groups, and accommodates a seating capacity of 100 people. It is known as the “Daishi-Do.” The temple basement, located under the main altar, is used as an assembly room for scouting activities. In addition, an office, meeting room, reception room, kitchen, and several classrooms are provided for the purposes of the institution’s operations. Bishops The temple has had eight head bishops since its establishment in 1912. The fourth and fifth bishop, Reverends Seytsu Takahashi and Ryosho Sogabe, are credited with creating what we now see as the Koyasan Buddhist Temple. Reverend Seytsu Takahashi was recognized for his personal contributions and strong faith in campaigning for building a new temple; Takahashi served a one year term in 1982 as the 482nd Hōin-daikajō-i for Kongobuji Temple at Mt. Koya, passing away shortly afterward in 1983. Reverend Taido Kitagawa was a co-organizer of the temple's Boy Scout Troop 379, one of the oldest Boy Scout troops in the United States. Reverend Taisen Miyata, the seventh bishop and translator of Esoteric Buddhist texts, served from 1993 to 2007 and was acting bishop from 2011 to 2013. *Rev. Shutai Aoyama (1909-1921) *Rev.

Future actor and gay rights activist George Takei was one of the troop's members. Other names for the troop include AL Post 525, Koyasan, and Green Giant. The Commodore Perry Scouts were a junior marching and maneuvering corps based in Los Angeles, California. They were sponsored by the Commodore Perry American Legion Post 525 and the Koyasan Buddhist Temple. Associated with the Los Angeles Boy Scout Troop 379, the Scouts boasted 164 Eagle Scouts among their ranks in 1935. Among the corps' awards were the state American Legion Championships in 1955, 1956, 1962, and 1963. The corps' colors are green, black, and white. The troop was also featured in the 1953 movie, Mister Scoutmaster, with Clifton Webb and George \\"Foghorn\\" Winslow. In the film he mobilized the Troop, played by members of Koyasan Troop 379, to search for Foghorn as he was missing. Later in 1971, the Drum & Bugle Corps, upon the request of the members, changed the name to Third Generation, as they were not nisei or issei generation Japanese Americans.

He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Roque joined the Cardinals' organization in 1967. He was called to the majors for the first time in September 1970 after his selection as an All-Star by the Class A California League, where he led the circuit in runs scored (101) and hits (165) in 137 games played. In 1971, after another strong showing, this time in the Double-A Texas League, Roque received another September audition. In his first game back with the Cardinals, he had three hits in four at bats September 26 against the Expos. Then he spent the second half of with the MLB Cardinals; he appeared in 32 games and started 19 as a center- or right fielder, but he batted an anaemic .104, with seven total hits in 67 at bats. On November 6, the Cardinals traded Roque to Montreal to reacquire their former All-Star catcher of the 1960s, Tim McCarver. Despite having hit a grand slam as Montreal's starting center fielder on Opening Day , and receiving a lengthy trial during the season's first month, his desperate struggles as a batsman continued. Three consecutive two-hit games from April 17–19 lifted his batting mark to .222, but he would collect only one more safety through May 6, when he was supplanted by Ron Woods as the club's right-handed-hitting center fielder. Roque was sent to Triple-A after May 15. He hit .148 in 61 at bats during his Expo tenure. As a major leaguer, he collected only 19 career hits and ten bases on balls in 154 plate appearances; he batted .137 with four doubles, one triple, and two home runs.

Its most important episode was the siege imposed by the Portuguese on the far larger Dutch garrison of Luanda. In 1641 Johan Maurits sent an expedition under Admiral Cornelis Jol from Recife in Dutch Brazil to seize the Angolan capital of Luanda. The Dutch were able to easily capture Luanda in August as the Portuguese forces were occupied inland in a campaign against the Kingdom of Kongo. The two countries fought to a stalemate over Angola, until in 1648 the governor of Rio de Janeiro and Angola, Salvador de Sá, reached Luanda and finding the city defended by 1200 Dutch troops, besieged them and regained it for Portugal exactly seven years after its loss. When a Dutch force of 300 soldiers returned from the interior to help their garrison of Luanda, they also surrendered to the Portuguese, but their allied warriors of the Queen Ndjinga fought a battle against the Portuguese and were defeated as well. Then, Salvador Correia de Sa sent a force to Benguela where the Dutch garrison surrendered. He also sent a fleet which recaptured the archipelago of São Tomé e Príncipe from the Dutch, who left behind their artillery. This was a decisive Dutch defeat since the Dutch Brazil couldn't survive without the slaves from Angola. And the end of the Dutch presence in South America (with the exception of the Guiana) meant not only the bankruptcy of the WIC, but also the end of the West Dutch empire.

The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) uses this genus name, while other sources use Drynaria to include Aglaomorpha. Species are commonly known as basket ferns. As circumscribed in PPG I, the genus contains around 50 species. Basket ferns are epiphytic or epipetric and are native to tropical Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Some species are economically important as medicinal plants. Description Aglaomorpha rigidula growing on rocks in Australia. The fertile foliage fronds are large and dark green, the smaller brown sterile nest fronds are clustered at their bases. Sori on the abaxial surface of the foliage frond of Aglaomorpha quercifolia. Basket ferns are characterized by the presence of two types of fronds, fertile foliage fronds and sterile nest fronds. The dark green foliage fronds are large, long, with elongated stalks. They are deeply lobed or pinnate, winged, and bear sori (structures producing and containing spores) on the bottom surfaces. The nest fronds are smaller rounded leaves basal to the foliage fronds. They do not bear sori and are persistent, not being shed after turning brown and dying. They form a characteristic 'basket' that collect litter and organic debris, hence the common name. The collected debris decompose into humus, providing the plants with nutrients it would otherwise not have received from being suspended above the ground. Both frond types grow from rhizomes typically anchored to a tree or a rock. The rhizomes of basket ferns are creeping and densely covered in brown scales. Habitat and distribution Basket ferns are epiphytic (growing on trees) or epipetric (growing on rocks). They can also sometimes be found in man-made structures like brick walls. They are found in wet tropical environments, usually in rainforests. Their native range extends from equatorial Africa to tropical South and East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Life cycle The \\"Drynaria\\" type prothallial germination. Like other spore-bearing plants, Aglaomorpha exhibits metagenesis or the alternation of generations. One generation being the diploid multicellular sporophyte (the phase where the plant is most familiar), and the other being the haploid multicellular gametophyte (the phase where the plant is known as a prothallus). Gametophytes develop from spores released by mature sporophytes; while sporophytes, in turn, develop from the fusion of gametes produced by mature prothalli. The synonym Drynaria lends its name to a certain type of prothallial germination, the 'Drynaria type', observed in several other ferns. In this type, the spores germinate into a germ filament composed of barrel- shaped chlorophyllous cells with one or more rhizoids at the base cell. The tipmost cell divides repeatedly by cross-walls, forming a broad spatulate (spoon-shaped) prothallial plate. One of the cells at the top margin of the prothallus then divides obliquely when it has 5, 10, or more cells across its width. This results in an obconical meristematic cell. Division by this type of cell is parallel to each other and perpendicular to the rest of the cells, forming rows. This eventually results in the formation of a notch at the anterior edge of the prothallus, giving it a roughly heart-shaped appearance (cordate). The cordate prothallus are usually smaller with thinner midribs than that of other members of Polypodiaceae. They are also usually more sparsely haired, with some prothalli rarely having multicellular hair. They mature after six to nine months, and finish their life cycle at around a year. The gametophytes produce male (antheridium), and female (archegonium) gametes. The gametes fuse, forming the diploid sporophyte, the 'fern' part of the life cycle. Aglaomorpha also naturally exhibits apospory, the production of a gametophyte not from spores, but directly from the vegetative cells of the sporophytes. Their leaves can develop prothalli under dim light and sporophytic buds in strong light. Ecology Amethystine pythons (Morelia amethistina) of Australia commonly seek shelter in Aglaomorpha rigidula Ants feeding on nectar secreted by the lower surface of a young Aglaomorpha quercifolia frond. Aglaomorpha, like some other genera of ferns (including Polybotrya and Polypodium), possess specialized nectar-secreting structures (nectaries) on the bases of the frond lobes or the underside of the fronds. The produced nectar is rich in sugars and amino acids. Their function may be to attract ants (or other organisms) for protection or for spore dispersal. They may also be simply excretory organs (hydathodes), used for exuding surplus metabolic products. The ant species Iridomyrmex cordatus is commonly associated with A. quercifolia, in addition to other epiphytic plants. In Australia, Aglaomorpha rigidula serve as shelter for amethystine pythons (Morelia amethistina) and scrub pythons (Morelia kinghorni). As much as 81% of sightings of the snakes in one study were in large individuals of A. rigidula located about above the ground. Snakes seek shelter in A. rigidula more frequently during the colder seasons. In the 19th century, Indigenous Australians were documented by the Norwegian explorer Carl Sofus Lumholtz to have hunted pythons regularly during the winter months by climbing up to individuals of A. rigidula. The large rhizome mass of Aglaomorpha can also serve as growing substrates for other plants like the ribbon fern (Ophioglossum pendulum). Due to their ability to preserve moisture and persistence even after death, the nest leaves of Aglaomorpha are also fertile hosts to a large number of water-borne fungi. Classification Basket ferns are classified under the subfamily Drynarioideae of the family Polypodiaceae. Species belonging to Aglaomorpha were once classified under the genus Polypodium (rockcap ferns), under the subgenus Aglaomorpha.

Traditional medicine Extracts from the rhizomes of some Aglaomorpha species are used extensively in traditional medicine. In China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos, the rhizomes of gu-sui-bu, Aglaomorpha fortunei (more frequently cited by Asian authors by its illegitimate synonym Drynaria fortunei), are commonly used to treat bone injuries. Its common name literally means \\"mender of shattered bones\\" in Chinese. Another species, the oak-leaf fern (Aglaomorpha quercifolia) is used similarly in South Asia and Maritime Southeast Asia. Conservation A basket fern in Ravensbourne National Park, Australia Species of Aglaomorpha commonly used in traditional medicine like A. roosii and A. quercifolia are in danger of being overexploited. None of the species are currently cultivated for the alternative medicine industry. Aglaomorpha are also considered endangered in some areas (like in New South Wales, Australia), due to threats of habitat loss and low population numbers. Evolution and fossil record Fossil species have not been transferred to Aglaomorpha in PPG I, and are still recorded in the genus Drynaria. In 2010, twelve well-preserved fossil specimens were described from the Sanying Formation of the Yangjie coal mine of China. Named Drynaria callispora, it comes from the Piacenzian age of the Pliocene epoch (about 3.6 to 2.5 million years ago). The fossil record of drynarioids is not very well documented due to the typically poor preservation of fossils recovered. Previous fossil species assigned to Drynaria include Drynaria astrostigma, D. dura, and D. tumulosa from the Cenomanian of the Czech Republic; and D. durum, all assigned tentatively to the genus in 1899. The arrangement and type of their sori, however, indicate that they are members of the family Matoniaceae instead. Outside the genus, Protodrynaria takhtajani from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary of Kursk Oblast, Russia shows some affinities to Drynaria but only distantly. The only other reasonably convincing fossil remains of drynarioids aside from D. callispora was a specimen named Polypodium quercifolia recovered in 1985 from the Late Miocene (23.03 to 5.332 million years ago) of Palembang, Indonesia. These were later transferred to the living species Aglaomorpha heraclea. It remains, as of 2011, the oldest known drynarioid.

Pakok is near the border with Ethiopia, near Dimma, Ethiopia. In 1985, a group of 500-600 army officers and soldiers from Uganda fled to South Sudan as refugees after a coup. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) gave them the choice of remaining to fight for South Sudan independence from the north, or return to Uganda. Almost all choose to remain, and were sent for training to SPLA bases in Ethiopia. The bases were tolerated by the Ethiopian government, which was hostile to the Khartoum regime. In 1988 the Ugandans were brought to Khor Shum, where they built a camp and lived there from February 1988 until November 1992. They were assigned work planting crops and building huts for an SPLA base, and also portering food from the refugee camp at Dimma. During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005) many civilians fled to Ethiopia. Several thousand unaccompanied boys were trained by the SPLA, then used to help prop up the Mengistu regime. When that regime collapsed in May 1991, the SPLA began moving hundreds of thousands of refugees back to Sudan, many of them temporarily settled at Nasir, Pochalla, and Pakok (the new name for Khor Shum). Refugees from Fugnido camp migrated to Pochala while those in Dimma walked to Pakok. Many of the Ugandan crops were destroyed when the first repatriates arrived, but some were harvested and sent to SPLA troops in the field. By the end of 1991 the United Nations registered slightly less than 10,000 refugees at Pakok, including 2,548 unaccompanied minors. In November 1991 a nutritional survey showed that two thirds of the boys at Pakok were moderately malnourished. In January 2007, more refugees from Dimma camp in Ethiopia arrived in Pakok after walking for 13 hours. Many of them were male students, who had left Dimma because their educational allowances for the 2006-2007 academic year had been reduced and because they did not want to wait any longer before returning home. Most of the returnees made their way by foot to the nearby village of Boma, where the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (SSRRC) registered 612 returnees, mainly from Upper Nile and Jonglei States.

Background After spending most of his childhood in Utah, Brian Draper moved with his family to Pocatello, Idaho. He met Torey Adamcik when they were both students at Pocatello High School. They were both interested in films and started recording their own. Cassie Jo Stoddart (December 21, 1989 – September 22, 2006) also attended the same school; she and both boys were juniors. The murder On the night of September 22, 2006, Cassie was house sitting for her aunt and uncle, Allison and Frank Contreras, on Whispering Cliffs Drive in northeast Bannock County.Sumter, A.N. (2019) Murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart: 16-year-old girl was brutally killed by her classmates, Brian Lee Draper and Torey Michael Adamcik. The Criminal Journal. Retrieved April 23, 2020. The Contreras family was out of town and had hired Cassie to come take care of their three cats and two dogs for the weekend. Cassie was visited that evening by her boyfriend, Matt Beckham, who arrived around 6:00 p.m. Later, classmates Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik, who were both 16 years old at the time, came over to the house to “hang out.” Cassie gave the friends a tour of the house, including the basement. The 4 teens went into the living room to watch the film , _Kill Bill, Volume II_ but Torey and Brian ended up leaving before the film ended, saying they 'wanted to watch a movie at their local movie theater instead'. Cassie and Matt stayed behind. Cassie was unaware that before the boys left, Brian unlocked the basement door so he and Torey could re-enter the house undetected. Sometime after leaving the house on Whispering Cliffs, Brian and Torey returned to the neighborhood, parked down the street, got out of the car, and put on costumes consisting of dark clothing, gloves, and white masks. They quietly entered the house through the basement door while Matt and Cassie were watching TV in the living room. They intentionally made some loud noises in an attempt to lure Matt and Cassie downstairs “so they could scare them.” Next, they found the circuit breaker and turned off the power in the house, hoping the pair would come downstairs to check the breaker. When Matt and Cassie did not come downstairs, the boys turned some of the lights back on. Cassie became uneasy after the temporary power outage, and Matt noticed that one of the Contreras’ dogs kept staring down the basement stairs, periodically barking or growling. Seeing that Cassie felt scared, Matt called his mother to ask if he could stay the night at the house with her to ease her mind, but she denied his request -instead she offered to let Cassie come home with Matt and stay at their house for the night, and she would bring Cassie back to the Whispering Cliffs house the next morning. However, Cassie felt it was her responsibility to stay at the house as she was hired to do and care for the animals, and declined Matt’s mom’s offer. At approximately 10:30 pm, Matt’s mom picked him up, leaving Cassie at the house alone. Matt called Torey’s cell phone to see where Torey and Brian were, possibly to meet up with them later. Matt said he could barely hear Torey, who was whispering on the phone, and Matt assumed the boys were in a movie theater. From the basement, Brian and Torey heard Matt leave. The teens turned the lights out again at the circuit breaker in the basement and waited, hoping Cassie would come downstairs to turn the lights back on, but she did not. Eventually the boys went upstairs. Brian was armed with a dagger-type weapon and Torey had a hunting-style knife. STATE v. DRAPER, Leagle Brian opened and slammed a closet door at the top of the stairs to scare Cassie, who was lying on the couch in the living room. The boys then brutally attacked her, stabbing Cassie approximately 30 times; 12 wounds were potentially fatal. The murder weapons were purchased at a pawn shop with the help of 18 year-old Joe Lucero. Throughout the investigation of the murder, police found that Brian and Torey had recorded their plan to murder Cassie in advance on video tape while they were at school. This video footage was shown at their trials. Arrest and interrogations Draper and Adamcik were arrested on September 27, 2006 and charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. During the interrogations, each teen blamed the other. Draper claimed he was in the same room with Adamcik when Cassie was killed but denied stabbing her. He later admitted stabbing her allegedly under commands from Adamcik. He led the investigators to Black Rock Canyon where the youths had disposed of the clothing, masks, and knives they used for the murder. Trial and sentencing At the trial, the prosecution revealed that Draper had said he was inspired by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre. Later Adamcik was said to have been inspired by the Scream horror film franchise. On April 17, 2007, Draper was found guilty. Adamcik's trial started on May 31, 2007; he was convicted on June 8, 2007. On August 21, 2007, based on being convicted of first-degree murder, each received a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole, and 30 years- to-life for being convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. Adamcik and Draper are both serving their time at Idaho State Correctional Institution. It is located in unincorporated Ada County, Idaho, near Kuna.\\"Locations.\\" Idaho Department of Correction. Retrieved on June 4, 2011. \\"Idaho State Correctional Institution (ISCI), 13500 S. Pleasant Valley Rd, Kuna, ID 83634\\" In November 2019, Adamcik’s sentence was upheld after his appeal was denied by the Idaho Supreme Court. Appeals Their attorneys filed separate appeals at the State Supreme Court in September 2010 for Adamcik and in April 2011 for Draper. Draper was seeking to have his conviction vacated or to be given a limited life sentence that would allow for his release on parole (if approved) after 30 years. The first appeal for both Adamcik and Draper was denied in a 3/2 decision. The high court vacated Draper's conviction on conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, saying that jurors were given erroneous instructions on that charge, but they affirmed his conviction for first-degree murder and life sentence without parole. In July 2015 Adamcik gained a hearing for post- conviction relief with state Sixth District Magistrate Judge Mitchell W. Brown. He claimed that testimony from character witnesses could have changed the outcome of the sentencing, but that his former attorney, against Adamcik's parents' wishes, chose not to call upon these witnesses. Adamcik said that his attorney believed that the prosecution would have submitted even more damaging evidence. In March 2016 Judge Brown denied his request for post-conviction relief.Shelbie Harris, \\"Remembering Cassie Jo — Brother opens up on 10th anniversary of grisly murder\\", Idaho State Journal, 25 Sep 2016; accessed 9 June 2017 Adamcik appealed Judge Brown's decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. A hearing was held on November 9, 2017, and on December 26, 2017, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Adamcik's appeal for post-conviction relief, upholding the district court decision. Following the Idaho Supreme Court's decision, Adamcik filed a federal writ of habeas corpus in January of 2018, in which he argues that the Idaho Supreme Court denied his first appeal based on a theory that was not presented to the jury. Adamcik also argues that he should be entitled to a new sentencing hearing in light of the Miller and Montgomery decisions (see section US Supreme Court and mandatory life sentences below). Federal magistrate judge Candy W. Dale presided over Adamcik's writ and on November 25, 2019, she denied the writ. Adamcik is currently appealing Judge Dale's decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Civil suit by Stoddart family In 2010 the Stoddart family filed a civil lawsuit against the Idaho School District. They claimed that the school was negligent and should have known that Draper and Adamcik posed a threat to others. Both the civil court and the State Supreme Court dismissed the case, saying the actions of the killers were not foreseeable. US Supreme Court and mandatory life sentences In Miller v. Alabama, , the United States Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders, even in cases of murder, ruling that the youth of the convict had to be considered. In 2016 the Supreme Court ruled in Montgomery v. Louisiana that this doctrine had to be applied to cases retroactively, and directed a review of all such cases, potentially 1200 to 1500 nationwide. Given juveniles' brain immaturity, the Supreme Court ruled that there had to be an opportunity to consider mitigating factors, as well as for later review of the sentences of such inmates, with possible relief for persons who had reformed. It said that \\"children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.\\"\\"Supreme Court: Life sentences on juveniles open for later reviews\\", Washington Post, 25 January 2016; accessed 9 June 2017 Draper and Adamcik are among the cases that the state courts will review under this ruling. Some 1100 cases are found in the states of Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Michigan, where state courts had ruled that the Supreme Court's Miller v. Alabama (2012) decision overturning mandatory life sentences for juveniles was not retroactive. On October 16, 2019, the supreme court held oral arguments in Mathena v. Malvo, which is another juvenile life without parole case that could have an effect on Adamcik and Draper's sentence.

Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, 359 U.S. 344 (1959), is a 9-to-0 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that a conviction violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution if the defendant is not given an opportunity \\"to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer\\" an inquiry put to him by the legislature of a U.S. state.. Background The state of Virginia enacted a package of statutes in September 1956 designed to ensure racial segregation in that state's public schools despite the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). The legislative program (\\"the Stanley Plan\\") was named for Governor Thomas B. Stanley, who proposed the program and successfully pushed for its enactment. The Stanley Plan was a critical element in the policy of \\"massive resistance\\" to the Brown ruling advocated by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr.Duke, p. 18. The Stanley Plan was introduced and passed during a special session of the Virginia General Assembly. During the special session, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson, an ardent segregationist, introduced a bill (unrelated to the Stanley Plan) to establish a seven-member Assembly committee to investigate any group seeking to influence public opinion in the state, teacher quality, uniformity of courses and curriculum in the public schools, and the effects of integration on public education.Baker, Robert E. and Feeley, Connie. \\"New Bill Would Give Stanley Pupil Assignment.\\" Washington Post. September 7, 1956.\\"Bills Aimed at NAACP Stir Va. Assembly Fight.\\" Washington Post. September 11, 1956. The bill passed on the last day of the special session. The legislation established a 10-member Assembly committee composed of six delegates and four senators.\\"Key Parts of Virginia School Bills.\\" Washington Post. September 23, 1956. The committee was charged with investigating the effect of integration on public schools, racial matters in the state in general, and the effectiveness of racial legislation. The committee was to issue a report and make recommendations (if any) to the Assembly by November 1, 1957. The legislative investigating committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the \\"Thomson Committee\\" after its chair, Delegate Thomson.Anzalone, p. 652-653. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing literature in favor of racial integration on behalf of a number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to racial integration, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge).Anzalone, p. 653. Scull refused to answer some of these questions and asked whether they pertained to the committee's legal charge. The committee went to court to force him to answer. The Circuit Court of Arlington County ordered Scull to answer the questions.Anzalone, p. 652. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court. Scull appealed his conviction to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Without comment, the state supreme court declined to hear his appeal in 1958.Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, p. lxxx. Scull appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case. Ruling Associate Justice Hugo Black wrote the decision for the unanimous Court. Scull made four claims: # That the committee was part of a program of state-sponsored harassment of those attempting to win racial integration of Virginia's public schools; # That the questions put to him violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and right to petition; # That the information sought was not relevant to the legislative function of the Virginia General Assembly; and # That despite repeated requests, the committee failed to show that its interrogatories were relevant to its legal charge. Black declined to address the first three of Scull's claims, deciding instead to rule on the narrow grounds of the fourth claim. The record of the committee's proceedings showed that Scull asked the committee what the purpose of its inquiry was, so that he could determine which questions put to him were pertinent.Scull, 359 U.S. at 347. Chairman Thomson made an ambiguous reply, then told Scull that \\"several\\" of the lines of inquiry did not apply to Scull.Scull, 359 U.S. at 347-348. When Scull claimed that he still did not know what properly constituted the committee's subjects of inquiry, the committee proceeded to ask 31 questions of Scull.Scull, 359 U.S. at 348. Black expressed scepticism regarding the committee's actions: \\"It is difficult to see how some of these questions have any relationship to the subjects the Committee was authorized to investigate, or how Scull could possibly discover any such relationship from the Chairman's statement.\\"Scull, 359 U.S. at 349. Thomson's testimony in the contempt proceeding before the Circuit Court further muddied things. During his testimony, Thomson \\"successively ruled out as inapplicable to Scull each of the subjects which the Legislature had authorized the Committee to investigate.\\"Scull, 359 U.S. at 350-351, quoted at 351. Nor did the state circuit court's instructions to Scull clarify matters. Black noted that the circuit court did not analyze any of the 31 questions put to Scull, did not explain to Scull what the subject of the committee's inquiry was, and did not explain how these questions related to that inquiry.Scull, 359 U.S. at 352. It was clear, Black held, that the questions put to Scull clearly involved the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association. The Court's long-established test in such cases was to determine if there was a compelling governmental interest which could justify infringement on these fundamental rights.Scull, 359 U.S. at 352-353. But the majority did not need to reach even this constitutional question, Black concluded, because Thomson's, the committee's, and the circuit court's statements about the subject of inquiry were so unclear that Scull was prevented from knowing what he was supposed to answer.Scull, 359 U.S. at 353. \\"To sustain his conviction for contempt under these circumstances would be to send him to jail for a crime he could not with reasonable certainty know he was committing.\\" The Supreme Court had repeatedly held (Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451 [1939], Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223 [1951], Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178 [1957], Flaxer v. United States, 358 U.S. 147 [1958]) that \\"fundamental fairness\\" required that a reasonable certainty exist as to what crime an individual might be committing. Relying on Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948), Black concluded that such certainty is \\"essential\\" when individuals are asked to give up their freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association out of a fear of violating a vague law. But the \\"far too wavering, confused and cloudy\\" responses given to Scull did not meet these standards. The Court reversed and remanded the case to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.

Jeffreys was born in Ceylon and made her stage debut in London in 1889. She quickly became a leading West End player. In the early 1890s she had a long run in the operetta La Cigale, and then was a member of Charles Wyndham's company at the Criterion Theatre. In 1895 she created a role in The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith, which she played in London and on Broadway. Most of her roles were in modern- dress drawing room comedy, but she also acted in classics including She Stoops to Conquer and The School for Scandal. In several years between 1895 and 1906 she was seen in the US, both on Broadway and in national tours. After that she continued to play in Britain, mostly in the West End, into the 1930s. During that decade she appeared in thirteen films, before retiring in 1938, five years before her death. Life and career Early years Jeffreys was born in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the daughter of Captain Dodsworth Jeffreys and his wife Elizabeth, née Corcor. She made her stage debut at the Savoy Theatre, London, with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1889 in the chorus of The Yeomen of the Guard. She then appeared at Her Majesty's Theatre in December 1889, as Butterfly in the pantomime Cinderella, after which she was engaged for the Lyric Theatre where she appeared in 1890 as Polly in The Sentry and then during the long run of La Cigale, she played and sang several leading female roles. In the early 1890s Jeffreys was a member of Charles Wyndham's company at the Criterion Theatre, where she appeared in The Bauble Shop, The Fringe of Society, The Headless Man, Betsy, Madame Favart, La Mascotte and Haste to the Wedding. In 1894 Jeffreys married the Hon Frederick Graham Curzon, the younger son of the 3rd Earl Howe.\\"Marriages\\", The Times, 12 September 1894, p. 1 Unlike some actresses who retired after marrying into the aristocracy,\\"Titles and the Stage\\", The Era, 20 February 1897, p. 16; and \\"From Actress to Aristocrat\\", The Sketch, 28 February 1906, p. 204 she continued her stage career.

In 1905 and 1906, for example, Jeffreys divided her time between London and the US. She appeared on Broadway as Queen Sonia in The Prince Consort and on an American tour as Lady Gay Spanker in London Assurance. After playing in On the Love Path at the Haymarket Theatre she returned to New York, to create the part of Lady Clarke Howland in The Fascinating Mr Vanderveldt, reappeared in London at the Duke of York's Theatre in a revival of The Marriage of Kitty, and again returned to New York, playing Mrs Brooke in The Dear Unfair Sex, after which she starred in a coast-to-coast tour as Kate Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer.

Incorporating traits from tablet computers, the GamePad has traditional input methods (such as buttons, dual analog sticks, and a D-pad), touchscreen controls, and motion controls. The touchscreen can be used to supplement a game by providing alternate, second screen functionality or an asymmetric view of a scenario in a game. The screen can also be used to play a game strictly on the GamePad screen, without the use of a television display. Conversely, non-gaming functions can be assigned to it as well, such as using it as a television remote. The Wii U GamePad can be used in conjunction with other controllers compatible with the console, such as the Wii Remote Plus, Wii Balance Board, and the more conventional Wii U Pro Controller. History The originally-unveiled Wii U GamePad prototype, featuring circle pads instead of analog sticks. During development of the Wii console, video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto brought in mobile phones and controllers for automotive navigation systems for inspiration for the Wii Remote, eventually producing a prototype that resembled a cell phone. Another design featured both an analog stick and a touchscreen, but Nintendo rejected the idea of a touchscreen on the controller, \\"since the portable console and living-room console would have been exactly the same\\". Nintendo's development team had determined that the Wii's notification light did not provide enough information to be useful beyond whether it had received content or not. With the complexity of modern televisions, Miyamoto believed that a monitor separate from the console would provide an easier way to check on the console's status without needing to use the television. Its operation as a supplemental display was also inspired by the common use of a similar display at karaoke establishments in Japan, which displays song information and also allows its users to select their next song. Satoru Iwata explained that the controller's design is intended to allow players to \\"see games in a different way,\\" a concept referred to as \\"asymmetric gaming\\" during Nintendo's E3 2012 press conference. With the Wii U's Miiverse social networking functionality, Iwata also likened the controller's screen to a \\"social window\\", which can allow users to remain connected even if they are not playing. Gyroscopic capabilities were added by the team specifically to aid in aiming for first and third person shooter games. The Nintendo EAD development team created two controller prototypes: a monitor with two Wii Remotes glued to the sides, and a display attached to a Wii Zapper. In a prototype shown at E3, the controller had featured circle pads similar to those of the Nintendo 3DS. On May 19, 2012, a photograph of a near-final version of the controller was leaked on Twitter by an employee of TT Games, revealing a wider build with ergonomic grips, a redesigned button layout, and analog sticks instead of circle pads. On June 3, 2012, Nintendo officially unveiled the final version of the controller, named \\"Wii U GamePad\\", in a video presentation preceding E3 2012. The presentation confirmed the leaked changes, and unveiled other features making use of the screen. Features The GamePad's primary feature is its , FWVGA (854x480), resistive touchscreen display, which can be controlled with either fingers or an included stylus. The screen can be used as a supplement to gameplay to provide additional functionality that can be controlled using the screen, or to stream gameplay from the console in lieu of a television display (Off-TV Play). The controller also features a front-facing camera (usable for video chat), dual analog sticks, nine-axis motion detection via a three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis magnetometer, rumble support, and an infrared array that can emulate the Wii Sensor Bar. The GamePad also supports NFC, which allows developers to create figurines (such as Nintendo's Amiibo figures) or cards that can wirelessly interact with the controller, and allow users to make contactless credit card transactions with compatible cards. In a special presentation preceding E3 2012, Nintendo unveiled more details about the GamePad; including its ability to be used as a remote control for a television with the Nintendo TVii app, and the ability to send handwritten messages and other content. The GamePad communicates with a Wii U console over a modified Wi-Fi protocol designed for low-latency transmission, establishing its connection with the console by using a variant of the WPS process, with proprietary transfer protocol and software co- developed with Broadcom. The GamePad's display contents are streamed as video from the console using a custom protocol and the H.264 video codec, for which the GamePad contains a hardware decoder. Nintendo's first presentation of the controller in 2011 led to confusion upon whether the Wii U would support the use of multiple GamePads. A Nintendo spokesperson stated that the GamePad would not be sold individually from a Wii U console, and Shigeru Miyamoto had not ruled out the possibility of using multiple GamePads with a single console—but also felt that it may be more convenient to use the Nintendo 3DS as a controller in this scenario as well—implying potential compatibility. During Nintendo's E3 2012 presentation, it was confirmed that Wii U games could theoretically support up to two GamePads simultaneously. However, this feature was ultimately never supported by any software.

In his 5 first-class appearances, he scored 32 runs at an average of 4.57, with a high score of 14. With the ball, he took 4 wickets at an expensive bowling average of 67.50, with best figures of 2/65. Westley attended Lancaster Grammar School with his twin brother, Stuart, and they both played for Oxford University in first- class cricket, one of the few times twins have appeared together in first- class cricket. He later became a cricket coach at Haileybury College. Westley died in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire on 15 May 1982, aged just 35.

The TARC is mainly used for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems and array antennas, where the outgoing power is unwanted reflected power. The name shows the similarities with the active reflection coefficient, which is used for single elements. The TARC is the square root of the sum of all outgoing powers at the ports, divided by the sum of all incident powers at the ports of an N-port antenna. Similarly to the active reflection coefficient, the TARC is a function of frequency, and it also depends on scan angle and tapering. With this definition we can characterize the multi-port antenna’s frequency bandwidth and radiation performance. TARC can be computed directly from the scattering matrix by : \\\\Gamma^t_a = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N |b_i|^2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N |a_i|^2}}, where [b]=[S][a]. [S] is the antenna's scattering matrix, [a] is the excitation vector, and [b] represents the scattered vector. The TARC is a real number between zero and one, although it is typically presented in decibel scale. When the value of the TARC is equal to zero, all the delivered power is accepted by the antenna and when it is equal to one, all the delivered is coming back as outgoing power (thus the all power is reflected, but not necessarily in the same port). The normalized total accepted power is given by (1-|\\\\Gamma^t_a|^2) . Since antennas in general have loss 0 \\\\leq \\\\epsilon \\\\leq 1 , the normalized total radiated power is given by \\\\epsilon_l = \\\\epsilon (1-|\\\\Gamma^t_a|^2) . If the directivity of the antenna array is known, the realized gain can therefore be computed by multiplication by \\\\epsilon_l . As with all reflection coefficients, a small reflection coefficient does not guarantee a high radiation efficiency since the small reflected signal could also be due to losses.

He was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia and immigrated to New York City in 1923, becoming a US citizen in 1928. Many of his illustrations were covers for such magazines as The New Yorker, The Saturday Evening Post, and Fortune. He also illustrated many books, including the first edition of George Gershwin's Song Book. His works are in New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum. He died in Amenia, New York. Life Constantin Alajálov was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, in 1900 to an Armenian family. In 1917, the Red Revolution broke out, interrupting Alajálov's time at the University of Petrograd. Unable to stay, Alajálov joined a government organized group of artists. Traveling the countryside, they painted large propaganda murals and posters for the revolution. After this, Alajálov emigrated to Persia and again started painting for a revolution until no longer safe. After his stay in Persia, Alajálov headed to Constantinople, his last stop before he emigrated to America at age 23. Getting a job was hard, but he finally landed one, painting wall murals at a restaurant about to be opened by Russian Countess Anna Zarnekau. Within three years, Alajálov was selling his paintings to The New Yorker magazine, where his first cover appeared on September 25, 1926. He went on to create more than 70 covers for the magazine. He also designed rugs for New York artist and entrepreneur Ralph Pearson. Alajálov's first cover for the Saturday Evening Post appeared on October 6, 1945; this was unusual in that he was also doing covers for The New Yorker at the time, and both publications ordinarily required exclusivity of their artists. His final cover was for the December 1, 1962, issue. That final cover portrayed an accomplished bridge player awakened from a dream, still analyzing her bridge hand. Many of his Saturday Evening Post cover paintings can be viewed at the American Illustrators Hall of Fame in Indianapolis. Alajalov died in New York in 1987. His papers are at Syracuse University, and the Archives of American Art. He bequeathed funding for a scholarship in his name to Boston University, which also maintains a collection of his photographs and scrapbooks. The Boston University holdings include a painting of Alajálov by George Gershwin. Book Illustrations *Flamingo, by Mary Borden (1927; Alajalov signed the dustjacket) *Tantivy Towers, by A. P.

Landmarks Lasjan is house to a large number of meadows, brick kilns and stone crushers. However, the latter have caused an increase of SPM in the air of this area. The meadow areas are also shrinking due to nearby landlords occupying them initially as farms and gradually as construction sites for houses and shops. The tombs of Hazrat Baba Syed Farid and Syed Ishaq Mantaqi al-Hamadani are also located here and Muslims of the Barelvi sect celebrate their _urs_ in the last week of December.

Having moved to the United States to escape persecution for his sexual orientation, he became known locally for establishing Sangat, an organization to support LGBT south-Asian youths, and internationally for publishing Narman, a poetry collection that was the first open expression of homosexual themes in the Urdu language. Nasim was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1996. Personal life Nasim was born in Faisalabad, Pakistan (then called Lyallpur) shortly before independence, a middle child in a large family. As a teenager he felt ostracized and alone, and was unable to live as openly gay; at the age of 21 he emigrated from Pakistan to the US, inspired in part by an article in Life magazine that he recalls describing the US as \\"the place for gays to be in\\". Several of his siblings later followed him to the US, and he eventually naturalized as a US citizen. Ifti Nasim died in hospital in Chicago on July 22, 2011 following a heart attack, at the age of 64. Poetry The publication for which Ifti Nasim was best known was a book of poetry entitled Narman, a word meaning \\"hermaphrodite\\" or \\"half-man, half-woman\\" in Persian. It met immediate controversy in Pakistan and had to be distributed underground; even the printer of the book, belatedly realizing its contents, was reported to shout, \\"Take these unholy and dirty books away from me, or I'll set them on fire!\\" However, its frankness inspired a younger generation of Pakistani poets to write \\"honest\\" poetry, a genre becoming known as \\"narmani\\" poetry. He later released Myrmecophile in 2000, and Abdoz in 2005.

It connects Blackpitts to New Street and is close to St Patrick’s Cathedral. History This area was originally part of the Liberty of Thomas Court and Donore (later called the Earl of Meath's Liberty), having been granted by Henry VIII to Sir William Brabazon, whose ancestors were later the Earls of Meath, after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538.Gillespie, Elgy, (1973), The Liberties of Dublin, E&T; O’Brien p.120 This location was then on the fringes of the expanding 18th- century city when the lane itself was set out by local brewer and Quaker Jacob Poole in 1721 to connect Blackpitts (where he had property) to New St. The lane has long had mixed industrial and residential use. Historically, tanning brewing and associated industries flourished in this part of Dublin, partly because the River Poddle is close by. The industrial heritage of the area even dates back even to the mid 17th century and is linked to and influenced by both Quakers and Huguenots. In 2006 archaeologists found evidence of medieval leather tanning off Fumbally Lane and nearby New Street with wood-lined soaking pits and elaborate ditch systems. They also identified that one of the existing large old former brewery buildings on Fumbally dates from the 1740s Particularly brewing flourished here in the Fumbally/Blackpitts area since the mid 18th century. It is very possible that the first Dublin porter was brewed here. The Poole and Taylor families, who were related, had brewing interests here from at least that time and before. From 1779 Samuel Madder operated the Blackpitts Porter Company on the north of the lane, he acquired a brewery from a James Farrell. In 1830 John Busby a distiller, acquired a brewery property in Fumbally and erected a new distillery here. This stone faced building features his initials JB and 1836 on a ’cast iron water tank’. This inscription can still be seen today. This particular refurbished 19th century stone faced building is part of the Fumbally Studio development and now home to both apartments and an office building. In 1862 John Busby listed as 'a licensed distiller and maltster' was still operating in Fumbally Thom's Irish Almanac and Official Directory for the Year 1862 but shortly afterwards sold out. The City of Dublin Brewery was situated on the corner of Fumbally and Backpitts and between 1867 and 1883 they took over the 'Busby' buildings including a still house spirit store and a brewhouse. Later the complex was used for other industrial uses including use as a textile factory in the late 19th century, many of the buildings on the brewing complex and along the lane later fell into disuse or dereliction. A significant detached three storey house possibly dating from the 1720s existed in the street until the late 1980s. According to an unpublished thesis, this rare example of an early Irish house may have been built by the relations of Jacob Poole a Quaker Taylor family Mc Rory, Rachel Unpublished thesis on the history of 12 Fumbally Lane who had brewing interests here and in Marrowbone Lane. It may have incorporated offices for the brewery owner, as a deed from 1789 connects it to the brewery. This house was later used as a textile factory, housed 'Blair's Fancy Linens' and was subsequently burnt down and demolished c 1990 Now only the large curved entrance walls and a cobble forecourt remain. According to the 1901 Census just 68 people are listed as living on Fumbally Lane and 102 are listed in the 1911 census. Origin of name The name Fumbally is a peculiar one and a name that has provoked a wide range of theories and suggestions as to its origin. The street is officially called Fumbally Lane today or Lána Fumbally. It has not always been called that and has had many name variations since 1721. The lane first appears in Charles Brooking's map of 1728 without a name and with variations in subsequent maps including John Rocque's map of 1756 as 'Bumbailiff’s Lane' and in Wilson's map of 1798 as 'Fumbailie’s Lane'. It is mistakenly suggested by the Rev. Mr. McCready in Dublin Street Names: Dated and Explained that Fumbally’s Lane (as it was then referred to in Thom's Directory) was just a ‘corruption of Bumbailiff's-lane’. McCready, Christopher T. Dublin Street Names: Dated and Explained. Dublin: Carraig Books, 1892 Fumbally's Lane is also the name James Joyce uses in chapter 3 of his novel Ulysses where he refers to \\"the tanyard smells\\" \\"Bumbailiff\\" is a derogatory term for \\"a bailiff or underbailiff employed in serving writs, making arrests.\\" However, there is some evidence that the name derives from a local Huguenot family named Fontvielle, Fomboilie, Fombily, Fombela, Fonveille and or Fombally. The name appears differently in a wide variety of sources. Christine Casey refers to the street association with a Huguenot family called Fombily and confirming this, Peter Pearson provides two names: David Fombily and Anthony Fombily who were described as ‘skinners’. Pearson, in reference to a study on the houses the Liberties by Peter Walsh, confirms this from a 1741 lease given on two houses on 'Fombily's Lane'. There is further evidence from a Registry of Deeds entry of an assignment dated 7 October 1762, mentioned in the RSAI Journal in 1893 The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland; Ser. 5, Vol. III, p. 90 (Berry, H. F., p. 302 (Burtchaell, G. D.) 1893 and from a reference to the RDS, written in 1915,Berry, Henry Fitz-Patrick, 1915, A History of the Royal Dublin Society, London: Longmans; p. 64. referring to a Royal Dublin Society prize for life drawing in March 1746 was won by a 'Mr. Fombally'. These all suggest that a Fombally or Fombely family resided in Dublin and were associated with this lane in the mid-18th century. A 1788 Domestic Intelligence report in The Gentleman's Magazine mentions an assault on the corner of \\"Fombally's Lane.\\" In addition, records retrieved from the International Genealogical Index show that Charles, David, Ester, Jacques, Jean, Jeanne, Phillippe and Susanne Fonvielle were all born in Dublin or christened at Peter St. Church and dwelling at Lucy Lane (now Chancery Place, Smithfield) at the beginning of the 18th century in the period between 1704 and 1718. Today Substantial physical evidence of the 18th & 19th century brewing and distilling industry buildings remain on both sides of the lane today, including storehouses and a five-storey malthouse. Most of these remnants of its industrial past have been converted to modern office use. Today, Fumbally Lane is home to dozens of people living in new apartments and in mainly 19th-century houses, although three possibly date to the late 18th century. It is also home to clusters of mainly design creative businesses based in Fumbally Court which is a large 19th-century distillery building, remodelled as offices c 1990 and Fumbally Square, a development of new office space developed in 2005. The street remains a ’unique remnant of the mixed residential and industrial architecture that characterized the area’ McCullough, Niall Dublin: An Urban History, Anne Street Press, Dublin, 2008, p.101 A number of local enterprises have borrowed the Fumbally name including the Fumbally Café and Fumbally Exchange, a non- profit community of design professionals founded in Fumbally Square in 2010.

He currently lives in Forlì, Italy, and he has been exhibited both in Italy and abroad. His works are noted for a theoretical reflection about image status shown on the \\"books\\" written by him, edited in publications on art, and essays by contemporary artists. Having expressed himself through geometric abstraction and informal painting from the late '80s, he achieved a synthesis of modern and contemporary art, using images of Italian specific tradition - the centuries '300 and '400 - in which tradition, innovation, abstract way, form and conceptual way are looking for an almost paradoxical form of synthesis. His landscapes are made of fluctuating fields, empty houses that are out of proportion, quiet and rich in creepy shadows that create a disturbing sort of visual paradox.  Biography  Graduated in painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna in 1984 with Prof. Maurizio Bottarelli.

To the east of the plains the Eastern Uplands run along the Ethiopean border. The county is administratively divided into the Natinga, Narus, Mogos, Jie, Kauto, Naita hills and Katodori payams. Jie Payam is located in the extreme northwest corner of the county, home of the minority tribe of Jie people. This payam has been cut off from its neighbors for years. It has no sustainable water, and all attempts to drill boreholes have failed. In the past the whole community has migrated to the Buma area of Jonglei state in search of water, resulting in violent conflict with neighboring communities. Kabekenyang/Natinga payam includes the villages of Natinga and Kabekenyan. Narus payam includes Narus and Nadapal. Economy The pastoral people own large numbers of cattle, sheep and goats. They graze their animals near their villages in the rainy season, then move them to dry-season pastures when the rains end, gradually moving back to the village which they reach at the start of the next rainy season. In February 2011 the mobile telephone operator Vivacell stated that they had an operational transmission booster in Narus and was planning to build other boosters in Lolim, Loyoro and Napotpot. The Holy Trinity Peace Village at Kuron, in the north east, was founded in 1997 with a demonstration farm. It as intended as a model to show that the different peoples of the area including Toposa, Jiye, Murle, Nyangatom and Kachipo could live and work together in harmony. The village has attracted considerable attention from aid organizations, with construction of a school, grinding mill, primary health care center etc. A bridge was built nearby over the Kuron River, which flows into the country from Ethiopia. Benefits were mixed, with improvements in communication with the Buda region offset by creation of a new route for cattle rustling. Health and education Toposa woman Malaria is a problem is some parts of the county. In 2011, long lasting mosquito nets were being distributed to women and children under the age of five by Population Services International - Sudan, an NGO. In the first quarter of 2011, 136 cases of Dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease) were reported from Kapoeta East out of 194 cases for all of South Sudan. The disease is caught by drinking stagnant contaminated water. In 2009 there were plans to launch a vaccination program against Meningitis in the county, following reports of 62 cases of Meningitis A in Kapoeta North and South. Kapoeta East has the poorest level of health care coverage of Eastern Equatoria with just one facility for every 66,000 people. The Catholic Diocese of Torit operates a primary health care center in Narus with 25 beds for in-patients. The center provides clinical care, laboratory services, ANC, Immunization, Health Education and Child care. The Kuron Primary Health Care Unit at Kuron Peace Village, in the extreme east of the county is supervised by the Narus center. The diocese also operates a primary health care center at Nanyangachor, towards the Ethiopian border in the east of the county. This center has a catchment population of over 300,000 people from the Toposa and Nyangatom ethnic groups. A 2008 survey found that less than 30% of school age children were enrolled in schools in the Eastern Equatoria State. Prevalent cultural values did not favor education, particularly of girls, and girls lacked support while at school. Following a program initiated by UNICEF assisted by other organizations such as SNV Netherlands, a slight increase in enrollment was achieved. In 2009, 6,090 pupils (3,799 boys, and 2,291 girls) were enrolled in Kapoeta East County compared to 6,041 pupils (3,754 boys and 2,287 girls) in 2008. Issues For many years the Toposa people of Kapoeta have exchanged cross-border cattle raids with the Turkana people of Kenya, and have been involved in conflict over pasturage and access to water points. The two governments began intensive bottom-up conflict resolution approaches in May 2010. By July 2011 the Kapoeta East county commissioner Titus Lokwacuma reported that the situation was much calmer than it had been in the past. The border crossing at Nadapal on the road from Narus to Lokichogio in Kenya has a vital role in supply of goods and services to Southern Sudan, forming part of the \\"Northern Corridor\\" linking the port of Mombasa through Kenya to Southern Sudan. In July 2008 the border crossing road was closed after Kenyan police prevented truckers from bringing arms into their country. A dispute flared up, with troops from both sides arriving, and the border remained closed for two days as the dispute was sorted out. In July 2011 the South Sudan government imposed a ban on entry of Somali people to the country, forcing hundreds of traders and truck drivers to camp at the Nadapal border. After a two-week delay the government relaxed the rule, saying that Somalis of Kenyan origin could enter as long as they produced their national identity cards or passports. For security reasons, non-Kenyan Somalis were still rigidly excluded. This came at a time when growing numbers of Kenyans were seeking business opportunities in the newly independent South Sudan, making the border crossing increasingly busy.

Education and family Anna Maria Heywood Denman was born in 1873 in Liverpool, the daughter of the Hon. Richard Denman and Helen McMicking. Her brother was Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman. She was educated privately. In 1895 she married John Emmott Barlow, the Liberal MP for Frome in Somerset and senior partner in his family businesses with principal interests in textiles, tea and coffee and rubber. They had two sons and two daughters. Her son John who succeeded his father to become the second baronet was Liberal candidate for Northwich in 1929. He later became a National Liberal representing Eddisbury from 1945–1950 and then a fully fledged Conservative being MP for Middleton and Prestwich from 1951–1966. In religion, Sir John and Lady Barlow were Quakers, Lady Barlow having converted to that denomination in about 1911. Politics Lady Barlow was a steadfast companion to her husband in his Somerset constituency over many years. She shared his political interests and campaigned with him and on his behalf. The couple were close friends of Liberal Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. She also stood in her own right for election to the House of Commons twice as a Liberal. First she contested the Derbyshire, High Peak division at the 1922 general election. At this election only thirty-three women were selected as candidates out of 1,387 contenders for the House of Commons’ 615 seats The Times, 6 November 1922 p.20 and only two, the Tory Lady Astor and the Liberal Margaret Wintringham were elected. Lady Barlow came third at High Peak in a three-cornered contest with 20% of the vote. She next fought the nearby seat of Ilkeston at the 1924 general election. The number of women candidates was growing now but there was a still a real sense in which they were pioneers. Overall only forty-one women were chosen to stand for election and Lady Barlow was one of only six female candidates out of a total of 333 Liberal hopefuls. Again she came third in a three-cornered race. A champion of the political rights of women, Lady Barlow was also a strong supporter of the traditional Liberal policy of free trade and shared her husband's close interest in labour affairs. In her later life during the 1950s and 60s, at a time when the Liberal Party had declined in public affections, Lady Barlow seems to have transferred her political allegiance to the National Liberals. Her son, the second baronet, was of course a National Liberal and later a Conservative MP, which must have been an influence upon her. She does not appear to have been politically active in campaigning for National Liberal candidates but did support a large number of their social and fundraising functions,The Times, 12 March 1955 p.8 & various ff as well as attending talks at meetings of the National Liberal Forum.The Times, 22 February 1962 p.12 Welfare reformer Lady Barlow was active in a number of different fields of moral, welfare and political reform. For 22 years she was President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Band of Hope Union an organisation dedicated to teaching and impressing upon children the importance and principles of sobriety and teetotalism. In addition, she appeared as a speaker for other temperance groups including The Young Abstainers Union.The Times, 12 September 1911 p.9 Outside her own electoral campaigning, Lady Barlow supported for the cause of women's suffrage and as a Quaker she was a campaigner for peace and disarmament. She and her husband opposed the introduction of conscription both before The Times, 29 November 1913 p.7 and more crucially during the First World War and sent their sons to a Quaker college in the United States. Lady Barlow particularly tried to promote peaceful international relations and reconciliation during and after the Great War. To this end she maintained an extensive correspondence with influential figures throughout Europe and maintained a speaking schedule at related events at home such as the Peacemakers’ Pilgrimage Rally in Hyde Park in 1926. Papers A number of Lady Barlow's papers and letters are contained in the Barlow Collection deposited in the Cambridge University Library, Manuscripts Departments.

The film was produced by Equinoxe Films. Filming took place in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Robben Island in South Africa beginning in April 2010. Controversy Winnie Mandela criticized the fact that she was not consulted for the making of a film about her life, stating, \\"I have absolutely nothing against Jennifer [Hudson, the film's star], but I have everything against the movie itself. I was not consulted. I am still alive, and I think that it is a total disrespect to come to South Africa, make a movie about my struggle, and call that movie some translation of a romantic life of Winnie Mandela.\\" Some South African actors also criticized the selection of American actors for South African roles; Oupa Lebogo, general secretary of the Creative Worker's Union (CWU) said of Hudson's casting, \\"This decision must be reversed, it must be stopped now. If the matter doesn't come up for discussion, we will push for a moratorium to be placed on the film being cast in South Africa. We are being undermined, there is no respect at all.\\" A preview of the film released in November 2010 was referred to by the filmmakers as originating from computer hackers, saying it was an \\"unauthorised download originated from a secure website belonging to our sales representative, Filmbridge ...

М. Художники XIX в. Мирза Кадым Эривани и Мир Мохсун Навваб / Под ред. Полевого В. М.. — Искусство Азербайджана. — Баку, 1954. — Т. IV. Mirza Kadym Irevani is famous for his drawings and miniature paintings. In the 1850s, he was commissioned by the Russians to repaint the interior of the Erivan Sardar's Palace, which had originally been painted by a Persian artist in 1815. He also painted 4 big (1 м X 2 м) portraits for the Sardar's Palace.Эривани / Под ред. Б. В. Иогансона. — Искусство стран и народов мира (краткая художественная энциклопедия): Советская энциклопедия, 1962. — P. 61. Mirza Kadym Erivani's works are kept in the National Art Museum of Azerbaijan, the Art Museum of Georgia, and the Hermitage. Biography Mirza Kadym Irevani was born in 1825, in the city of Erivan in Qajar Iran during the tenure of the last Iranian governor of the Erivan Khanate, Hossein Khan Sardar, and belonged to a \\"family of professional decorators\\". During Hossein Khan's capable governorship, Erivan prospered; the Sardar's Palace became decorated with mirrors, stuccos, and fourteen paintings. The paintings depicted four heroes from the Iranian Shahnameh epic, including Rostam and Sohrab, as well as contemporary Iranian notables; king Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (1797–1834), Abbas Mirza, Hossein Khan Sardar, and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar. Other paintings included two hunting and battle scenes. All fourteen paintings were originally painted in 1815 by a Persian painter named ʿAbd al- Rāziq. At the decisive siege of Erivan of 1827, during the Russo–Persian War of 1826-1828, the Russian artillery gravely damaged the Sardar's Palace. After the Iranians were forced to cede Erivan to the Russians per the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828, the Erivan Sardar's palace was neglected by the Russians, and thus fell in ruins. A few decades later, in 1850, when Orientalism came in vogue, the Russians decided to rebuild the palace. The Russians commissioned Mirza Kadym Irevani to repaint the interior of the palace. Thus; \\"all historical figures depicted on the walls of the palace were from 30-40 years earlier than the time of Mirza Kadym Irevani\\". Mirza Kadym Irevani's oeuvre consists mostly of \\"typical Persian miniatures and lacquers\\". He also created some \\"monumental and easel paintings with figurative motives\\", but they are considered to be of lesser aesthetic quality.

Southern Pacific Transportation Company and predecessor railroads had been operating ferries between San Francisco and Oakland, California since 1862. By the early 20th century, service had stabilized on three routes to the San Francisco Ferry Building from Oakland Pier, Alameda, and the San Antonio Creek estuary. Each route required two ferries shuttling back and forth to meet the departure schedule, with a third ferry in reserve when one boat needed maintenance or repair. Southern Pacific's engineering department designed Alameda for the heavily traveled Oakland Pier route as passenger counts rose during the period of prosperity preceding World War I. Alameda used side wheels for propulsion; but, instead of being powered by a single walking beam engine, wheels were powered independently by two engines for greater maneuverability. The twin stacks were distinctive among 20th century San Francisco Bay ferries.Ford, Robert S. Red Trains in the East Bay (1977) Interurbans Publications pp.133 Alameda Alameda (documentation number 211868) was launched from Southern Pacific's Oakland shipyard in late 1913 and placed in service on 23 February 1914. In the early morning hours of 15 January 1939, Alameda made the last ferry run with connecting Oakland electric railway service before electric trains were routed over the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. Alameda was then idled until World War II when she was used as a relief boat for the ferries transporting shipyard workers from San Francisco to the Richmond Shipyards. She was sold to the United States Navy as floating barracks designated YHB-25, and scrapped in 1948.Ford, Robert S. Red Trains in the East Bay (1977) Interurbans Publications pp.134,209,284-286. Santa Clara The hull of Santa Clara was built by New Jersey Ship Building Company for $97,000 while Alameda occupied Southern Pacific's Oakland shipyard; but the hull was towed to Oakland for completion after Alameda entered service. Santa Clara (documentation number 213389) was placed in service on 3 July 1915. Santa Clara required extensive repair later that year following a fire started in the engine room. After being temporarily idled with Alameda following routing of electric commuter trains over the Bay Bridge, Santa Clara carried shipyard workers from San Francisco to Marinship through the second world war; and was scrapped in 1947.Ford, Robert S.

It was published by Laurentius Salvius in Holmiæ (Stockholm) in three volumes, with parts appearing from 1766 to 1768. It contains many species not covered in the previous edition, the 10th edition which was the starting point for zoological nomenclature. Starting point Only five editions of ' were written by Linnaeus himself, namely the first, second, sixth, tenth and twelfth. When a \\"starting point\\" for zoological nomenclature was first considered, in the Strickland Code of 1843, the 12th edition of ' was chosen, so that any names which Linnaeus had altered from previous editions would be recorded in their final state. It was later replaced by the 10th edition as the starting point for most zoological nomenclature. The starting point for most names in botanical nomenclature is the 1753 work '. Format Linnaeus divided the 12th edition into three volumes, the first of which was published in two parts. Volume 1 covered ' – the animal kingdom – with the first 532 pages appearing as Part 1 in 1766, and pages 533–1327 appearing as Part 2 in 1767. Volume 2 covered ' – the plant kingdom; it comprised 736 pages and appeared in 1767, with an additional 142-page '. Volume 3 covered ' – the mineral kingdom – and appendices to all three volumes; it comprised 236 pages and was published in 1768. Including appendices, front matter and back matter, the three volumes cover around 2,400 pages. Novelties Many species were included in the 12th edition which had not been included in earlier editions. For example, Linnaeus had included 700 species of mollusc in the 10th edition, and added a further 100 species for the 12th edition. Similarly, the number of bird species in the 12th edition was twice the number in the 10th edition. Sponges were included in the 12th edition, in the class \\"Zoophyta\\", having been omitted from previous editions. The 12th edition also included the hundred insect species published separately in ', and omitted a claim which Linnaeus had made in earlier editions, that new species do not form, implicitly allowing speciation.

They play in the Ardal Leagues North West, which is at tier 3 of the Welsh football pyramid.  History  The first record of a Saltney-based football club was in 1908 when they joined The Combination. The Combination was originally composed from clubs from Manchester and Liverpool and their environment. In later years, several Welsh clubs joined. One club, Northwich Victoria, earned admission to the Football League as members of The Combination. This League ran from 1890-1911. Saltney had a fantastic first season in the league finishing in 2nd place, Tranmere Rovers finished 3rd! We are uncertain on what happened after the league disbanded in 1911. In the 1919-20 season, Saltney-based side Crichton’s Athletic was a founder member of Cheshire County League. In 1921, the side changed their name to Saltney Athletic. In 1923, the side finished in 6th position before leaving the Cheshire County League. The history becomes a little hazy from then until the 1974-75 season when Saltney Social became founder members of Clwyd Football League, where they played for two seasons. For the 1992-93 season, Saltney Community Centre was formed. They entered the Clwyd League system in Division 1. A great start resulted in a 3rd play finish and instant promotion to the prestigious Clwyd Premier Division. In their first effort at the Clwyd top flight they finished in a very respectable 2nd place before going one better the following year, winning the League and being duly promoted to the Welsh Alliance League. In their two seasons in the league they finished in 6th, then 11th positions before resigning from the Alliance in 1998. The current club was formed in 2010 by two friends from the Saltney area, Marc Edwards and Andrew Johnson. Both have the ultimate vision of bringing their community together through football. The club are also known by their nickname of \\"The Bordermen\\", due to where they are situated. In their debut season, the Bordermen were victorious in both the League Cup, and the prestigious Horace Wynne Cup, beating Llanuwchlyn and Castell Alun in the respective finals. They also finished 3rd in their league, Welsh National Division 1.

The assault - which represented the largest and most audacious attack launched in the republic for over a year \\\\- is considered to have \\"shattered\\" the image of Kadyrov's unshakeable rule in Chechnya, as it was the first time in six years that his seemingly impregnable village had come under attack. Attack According to the rebel website Kavkaz Center, three detachments totaling up to 60 militants (and featuring ten suicide bombers) led by Emirs Zaurbek, Makhran, and Abdurakhman - commanders directly subordinate to Aslambek Vadalov \\\\- entered the village around 4:30 a.m. local time. The rebels overran two checkpoints and destroyed an armored personnel carrier before setting fire to ten of the homes of Kadyrov’s closest associates; they also seized ammunition and communications equipment. The militants were said to have employed the tactics of Afghanistan's Taliban, with groups of guerrillas attacking an object and inflicting as much damage as possible with no intention of retreating; some reports claimed that the militants “practically captured” the village for several hours and that the government had to revert to using artillery and helicopters to drive them out. During the fighting the militants managed to send an SMS message to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s North Caucasus service at 6:30 a.m. saying, “Tsentoroy is burning,” and television footage the following day showed a burnt-out car just 150 meters from the entrance to Kadyrov’s fortress-like residence, exhibiting just how deeply the brazen attack had penetrated the village. The version of events presented by Kadyrov was that his security forces had advance notice of the operation, permitted the fighters to enter the village and disperse, and then cornered them, killing 12 \\"devils.\\" He also added that the only militants who managed to escape “were filming for a report to their sponsors, but we are confident they will be found.”. Russian officials stated that all twelve slain militants were wearing explosive vests and that seven of those killed had detonated the vests and were thus unidentifiable; rebel sources in the village disputed this, citing unnamed residents of Tsentoroy who claimed that at least some of the dead identified as attackers were actually young men held in Kadyrov’s notorious private prison that were executed on his orders so as to increase the body count. Militant sources would add that the reason they were said to be “unidentifiable” was because it would have been clear that those dead were indeed long-held prisoners rather than members of the insurgent assault team, an allegation that one analyst stated was “entirely in keeping with what is known of [Kadyrov's] treatment of anyone suspected of abetting, or even sympathizing with the insurgency.\\" Chechen Interior Ministry sources would confirm that the insurgents entered the village and set fire to several homes, and a Chechen security official would also confirm that at least one of the fighters killed was from Zaurbek Avdorkhanov's group. Additionally, it was also reported that the rebels used weapons that were seized from the Ingush Interior Ministry's armory during the Shamil Basayev-led 2004 Nazran raid; among the arms recovered at the scene were seven rocket launchers, three Kalashnikov machine guns, nine Kalashnikov assault rifles, sixteen rounds for various types of grenade launchers, three hand grenades, 1,500 rounds of ammunition of various calibers, eight improvised explosive devices, and ten additional explosive devices. An expert on the area speaking to the website \\"Caucasian Knot\\" called into question Kadyrov's estimate of the attacking force, noting that the number of fighters alleged by the Chechen President would be incapable of launching an attack on the village since \\"all approaches to Tsentoroy, not to mention the village, are completely controlled by law enforcement. To try and storm the town, where almost every citizen is armed or enlisted in various law enforcement agencies, appears very doubtful...it would be easier to attack Kadyrov's convoy rather than commit suicide by attempting to break into a well-fortified town.\\" Aftermath The day after the attack, Vladmir Markin, spokesman for the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor (SKP) of the Russian Federation, stated that the Central Investigation Department of the North Caucasus and the Southern Federal District would investigate the attacks. On 2 September, Ramzan Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted as an indicator of the government's weakness. Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave in the days after the attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels. The operation was also viewed as being impossible without the aid of informants in the circles close to Kadyrov, leading to \\"massive\\" interrogations in the village. Some on Kadyrov's side allegedly blamed the incident on Isa Yamadaev's return to Chechnya, thinking that he or some of his associates may have supplied critical information to the insurgents due to a long-running, deadly feud between their two families; nothing has since emerged to tie Yamadaev to the assault in any way. Most analysis of the attack saw it as a \\"very painful blow\\" against both Kadyrov and Moscow. Earlier in the month, a quartet of top insurgent field commanders - including Aslambek Vadalov - had renounced their oaths of allegiance to Caucasus Emirate supreme leader Dokka Umarov in order to continue to fight for Chechen independence rather than a pan-Islamic state encompassing the entire North Caucasus; whereas many commentators expected this to weaken the insurgency, the Tsentoroy attack proved decisively that the Chechnya-based fighters were still a force to be reckoned with. Also in early August, Kadyrov made the outlandish claim that there were a \\"maximum [of] seventy\\" Islamist militants remaining in Chechnya; not only did the operation clearly refute that, but it also showed that the rebels still had strategists experienced enough to plan and coordinate a three-pronged attack as well as the types of mid-level commanders capable of carrying it out with minimal casualties. Disputed Reports of Deaths of Zaurbek Advorkhanov and Emir Ayub On 1 August 2012, Kadyrov announced that three militants involved in the attack had been killed in a special operation in Galashki, Ingushetia on 31 July. According to the Chechen president, Russian security forces received information that the militants were due at a private residence to pick up a bride for Ibrahim Avdorkhanov, then laid explosives which detonated and killed the trio. The slain insurgents were identified as Zaurbek Advorkhanov, Ibragim Advorkhanov and Ayub Khaladov, all who indeed participated in the 2010 attack on Tsentoroy. This account was disputed by Ingush President Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, who said the explosion actually took place on 29 July and that it was an accidental detonation of an explosive device, not a pre-planned operation by Russian security forces. Yevkurov also stated that two men were killed and another injured, and identified the deceased as Idris Abayev and Alikhan Dolkhadov. Following Kadyrov's 1 August statement, Ingush Security Council Secretary Akhmed Kotiyev revised Yevkurov's account, claiming that the men killed were indeed the Avdorkhanov brothers and Khaladov, and that they had been identified through documents they were carrying. This remains unconfirmed, as the Russian government has offered no visual proof and militant groups haven't commented.

Nilsson later recorded the song on his 1980 album Flash Harry. Lyrics & music Lennon and Nilsson wrote \\"Old Dirt Road\\" while Lennon was working with Nilsson producing Nilsson's Pussy Cats album. Lennon had written the first verse, when he was interrupted by some business people, and asked Nilsson to provide an \\"Americanism.\\" Nilsson provided a line, which Lennon incorporated into the song. Nilsson then continued writing part of the song. \\"Old Dirt Road\\" uses the road as a metaphor for a point of stability in an unstable world and a life subject to variability. In the line originally provided by Nilsson, life is described as \\"trying to shovel smoke with a pitchfork in the wind.\\" Even though the road is apparently stable, it too is at risk from the possibility of a mudslide. The singer advises the listener to just \\"keep on keepin' on.\\" The lyrics incorporate a reference to Bob Nolan's song \\"Cool Water,\\" where someone on the old dirt road suggests that the only thing needed is \\"cool, clear water.\\" According to authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen, the lyrics don't \\"make much literal sense but somehow sound right on an intuitive level.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan finds the mood of the song to be \\"stoical rather than despairing\\" and describes the lyrics as laissez-faire. The song is in the form of a ballad, with some country music influence. Jesse Ed Davis' guitar contributes to the country atmosphere. Musically, it reproduces some of the sound from Lennon's Imagine album in employing dual pianos, one played by Lennon and one played by Nicky Hopkins. Urish and Bielen describe the music as \\"mournful and relaxed.\\" John Blaney claims that it captures \\"an atmosphere of listless intoxication.\\" Music journalist Paul du Noyer believes that Charlie Patton's \\"Ain't Goin' Down That Dirt Road\\" may have been an influence on the song. Critical reception Lennon biographer Geoffery Giuliano describes \\"Old Dirt Road\\" as a \\"throwaway.\\" Allmusic critic Richard Ginell does not rate the song highly either. However, Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes it as \\"an enjoyable pop song.\\" Johnny Rogan praises the \\"interesting imagery\\" of the lyrics, particularly the line about shovelling smoke. Lennon himself dismissed the song as \\"just a song\\" and that he and Nilsson wrote it because they were drunk and nothing better to do. However, music journalist Paul du Noyer believes that Lennon under-rated the song, as he did with several other songs of this period. Author John Blaney agrees with du Noyer, believing that Lennon under-rated the song because it was written during a difficult period in Lennon's life, when he was separated from Yoko Ono and doing a lot of drinking and consuming drugs with Nilsson. Other versions A very early sketch of the song was included on Lennon's album Menlove Ave. and a more developed version, including acoustic guitar was included on John Lennon Anthology. The country music feel of the song is more pronounced on the Menlove Ave. version, as Jesse Ed Davis' guitar part is heard on its own. The Menlove Ave. version also makes more transparent the influence of chain gang songs on the \\"cool, clear water\\" line. The Anthology version differs from the Walls and Bridges version in the bridge and the ending, and also lacks the overdubs that were added to the Walls and Bridges version.

Dragging the river turned up two legs and two handless arms. The body was thought to be that of Captain William Bernard Butt, aged 52, of 248, Old Bath Road, Cheltenham, who had been missing since January. Sir Bernard Spilsbury carried out a post-mortem on the torso and other remains: he considered that they were parts of the same body and found several points of similarity with the missing Captain. Brian Sullivan, a 27-year-old dancer, the son of a nurse who looked after Butt's invalid wife, had committed suicide at his mother's home at Tower Lodge, Leckhampton, a few days after the Captain's disappearance and his blood-stained overcoat was found under the floorboards there. Extensive searches failed to find the head and hands of the body, and the inquest left the identity of the remains and cause of death officially undetermined.

The novel describes the difficulties encountered in the lives of characters as they embrace immigration, rationalism, and religious fundamentalism. Set in New England, the novel begins in early 2001 and describes the life of Hattie Kong, a widowed retired high school teacher. Kong's quiet life is interrupted when a family of Cambodian immigrants moves to her town. The family came to the United States as refugees from the Khmer Rouge. By the time that Kong meets them they are impoverished and racked by family conflicts and alcoholism. Kong soon develops a close friendship with the family's teenage daughter. The narrative concludes shortly after the September 11 attacks. The daughter of a missionary, Kong prides herself on her liberalism and compassion and rejection of superstitious beliefs. Throughout the novel, she struggles with a dislike of the worldview embraced by other skeptics and a difficulty living in harmony with the beliefs of others. The novel's point of view alternates between multiple characters, a technique praised by Donna Rifkind in her review of the book in the New York Times. Jen often employs Black humor throughout the book as she described the stress and suspicion of many characters. In his review of the book in the Washington Post, Ron Charles praises Jen for combining different themes with \\"endearing finesse\\", but faults her treatment of fundamentalist Christianity as \\"cliche\\".

Home to both seasonal and year-round residents, the lake and surrounding area offer public boating, fishing, hunting, hiking, biking, ATV, horse, and snowmobile trails, Despite its small population Brantingham is doing very well economically, with restaurants like; Pine Tree Tavern, Trailside Inn, The Coachlight, and Brantingham Inn and Motel, it is also home to an 18-hole golf course, Brantingham General Store, Brantingham Fire Department, and several camps. During the winter months, the area receives an average 150 inches of snow, making Brantingham a popular destination for winter enthusiasts.Lewis County Weather. \\"Lewis County Weather, USA.com. Retrieved on 2 January 2015.  History  Oneida Indians, who called the lake \\"Fish Lake\\", ceded most of the land in and around Brantingham to the state of New York by formal treaty on February 22, 1788. In 1793, Alexander Macomb made an application to purchase more than of land at six cents an acre, including all of Lewis County. On April 4, 1794, the land was sold to Thomas Hopper Brantingham of Philadelphia for $23,073, (forty-six cents an acre), however soon after, he executed three mortgages on the land, neglecting to make good on his debts, eventually it was sold again. John Greig became the next to acquire the land on which Brantingham sits. The town name eventually was changed to Greig, due to the past negative perception of Thomas Hooper Brantingham. Even with this change, the lake and surrounding hamlet kept the name Brantingham.  Geography  Brantingham Lake covers with of shoreline. The lake has a maximum depth of 70 feet, and an average depth of 30 feet in accordance with fluctuating yearly water levels. There are two islands present, Grant (or Round) Island, and Dark Island (about three times larger). Two distinct sand bars, each one marked by buoys and one visibly submerged sand bar stemming at the rear of Dark Island are visible. Depending on yearly water levels, these shallow sand bars may only be covered by a few feet of water, requiring caution from boaters. The lake bottom yields little vegetation, but rather is covered by organic matter and sand, making the lake favorable for recreational use during the summer months. On the southwestern side of the lake, there's an inlet leading to the portion of the lake that is referred to as the \\"Lily Pond.\\" There are two bridges crossing this inlet: 1) the wood walking bridge nearest Brantingham is a remnant from the Brantingham Hotel, and 2) the concrete bridge where Cottage Road crosses the inlet. Both bridges are navigable by most motor boats, although the height is limited. At the farthest end of the Lily Pond (to the west of the base of \\"Shady Point\\") is a small concrete dam used to draw down lake levels from October to May in order to prevent shore erosion and damage to docks during the winter. The water traveling over that dam flows south to the Lake of the Pines, then down Fish Creek and eventually into the Black River. A variety of fish are present in the lake such as Blue Gill, northern pike, Brown Bullhead, Lake Whitefish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. In 1995 a brief severe weather phenomenon, a microburst, caused heavy damage to lake properties and the surrounding landscape.National Weather Service Albany NY. \\"Adirondack Derecho of July 1995, National Weather Service Albany NY, Albany, NY, 15 July 2005.

Conservation Silene hawaiiensis was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act on 04 March 1994. Threats to the plant include fire in some areas. Fire also fosters the takeover of invasive plant species such as Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass), which displaces native plants; the flammable fountain grass then increases the likelihood of more fire. Construction and other activities at Mauna Kea and the Pohakuloa Training Area may threaten some plants. Introduced Mouflon sheep are a threat to this and other native plants.

First Formation  In May–June 1938, the 7th Mechanized Corps headquarters was relocated from Novy Petergof to Luga and converted into the 10th Tank Corps when the Red Army mechanized forces transitioned from a mechanized corps structure to a tank corps structure. On 4 August 1938, the 107th Separate Air Liaison Flight was formed as part of the corps at Luga. On 27 September 1939, the corps was relocated to the Pskov area on the Estonian border, to back up threats of force against that country. On 2 October it was moved to the Latvian border to threaten Latvia as well. Both of these movements were made to force the two Baltic states into signing the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty and the Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, respectively, which established Soviet military bases on the territory of both countries. On 10 October, the 18th Light Tank Brigade was transferred to another unit and replaced by the 1st Light Tank Brigade. The corps' other brigades were the 13th Light Tank Brigade and the 15th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade. On 13 October the corps was transferred back to the Leningrad Military District from the 8th Army and returned to Luga. By 30 November, in preparation for the Winter War, the Soviet attack on Finland, the 10th was relocated to the Finnish border as part of the 7th Army. On 30 November, the corps crossed the border at the beginning of the invasion, with its headquarters in the Korkiamyaki area, then at Rautu and Liipua. Between 13 and 16 December the 10th Tank Corps was transferred to advance towards Vyborg, concentrating in the Baboshino area. Its units were pulled out of combat and moved to Baboshin, with the headquarters at Tomilla by 20 December. The Red Army command considered the performance of the large tank corps to be unsatisfactory and ordered all of them, including the 10th, disbanded in January 1940 by an order dated 17 January. The corps headquarters was moved to Kingisepp to be used to form an army group under the command of Dmitry Pavlov.  Second Formation  The corps was reformed in April 1942Dupuy Institute Forum Discussion on Tank/Mech Corps and was part of Steppe Front for the Battle of Kursk. Fatyh Zaripovich Sharipov appears to have won the Hero of the Soviet Union while operating with the corps. 10th Tank Corps was subsequently assigned to the 5th Guards Tank Army, but by April 1945 during the Battle of Berlin, the 10th Tank Corps was part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK).Боевой состав Советской Армии на 1 апреля 1945 г. and Боевой состав Советской Армии на 1 мая 1945 г. See Combat composition of the Soviet Army. It comprised the 178th, 183rd, and 186th Tank Brigades, and the 11th Motor Rifle Brigade. It should not be confused with 30th Tank Corps, which became 10th Guards Tank Corps. Postwar it became the 10th Tank Division. On 30 April 1957, it became the 34th Heavy Tank Division. In March 1965, it became the 34th Tank Division. On 20 March 1992, it was taken over by Belarus. The division became the 34th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base, part of North Western Operational Command.
