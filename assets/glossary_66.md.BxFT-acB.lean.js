Around 2013 this regional radio network, previously powered by Zetron and Fylde MPT1327 controllers on Band III was redeveloped, with custom controllers designed by Maxxwave and was redeployed to lower frequency bands.

Ambitalk has installed microwave links and battery backup to each transmitter site.  Recognition  The UK Government has commissioned a UK Spectrum Usage and Demand report through the UK Spectrum Policy Forum (run by Department for Culture, Media and Sport). This report looks at all major communications solutions available across the UK and notes that a significant number of two way radio users in the UK are now using Ambitalk as their preferred communications platform.UK Spectrum Usage and Demand - Second Edition - Summary Report. 16 December 2015 In 2015, Ambitalk was awardedthe FCS Gerald David OBE award for Innovation in Business Radio. This award is given by the FCS, the UK communications trade body.

This was presented by Adrian Scrase, CTO of ETSI. In July 2016, Ambitalk received two \\"Comms Business Awards\\" for \\"Market Maker - Mobile\\" and \\"Ones to Watch\\".  Low frequency bands  Contrary to current trends, Ambitalk uses lower frequency bands than competing technologies.S. F. Hasan, Emerging Trends in Communications Networks, Section 6.1 - 5G Expectations and Limitations. Springer, Higher frequency bands are preferred for rolling out wireless communications systems due to the lack of interference from atmospheric disturbances, smaller antennas and more manageable coverage characteristics, vital when planning a Cellular network Low frequencies on the other hand are traditionally plagued by electronic interference from numerous sources and are prone to being unusable for weeks on end during summer months due to interference from foreign transmitters due to Sporadic E propagation thereby giving poor quality signals. Ambitalk addresses this interference by developing a Smart antenna array for low frequency bands. Such systems are normally only deployed in far higher frequency bands and the use of such a system in a low frequency band is somewhat unusual.

Previously, he was Legislator of the City of Buenos Aires by Commitment to Change. He is one of the most important members of Republican Proposal and led Mauricio Macri's presidential campaigns of 2015 and 2019. Early life and education Marcos Pe√±a was born on March 15, 1977, in Buenos Aires. Pe√±a is the son of F√©lix Pe√±a, a foreign trade specialist, and Clara Braun, an academic.

While he was Minister of Interior, right-wing groups organized street demonstrations in Paris on 6 February 1934 in which the police shot dead fourteen people. In the aftermath the cabinet was forced to resign. Frot supported Republican institutions, but by the late 1930s was a committed pacifist. In July 1940 he voted for the constitutional change that established the collaborationist Vichy government. As a result, he was barred from politics after the war. Early years (1883‚Äì1924) Eug√®ne Frot was born on 2 October 1893 in Montargis, Loiret. He became an attorney at the Paris court of appeal, and a publicist. In the general election of 1919 he ran for Loiret at the head of the Republican Concentration and Renovation list, but was not elected. Political career (1924‚Äì41) Deputy (1924‚Äì32) On 11 May 1924 Frot ran again as candidate of the Left Union, and was elected. He joined the Socialist group in the chamber. He was reelected in the first round for the Montargis constituency on the list of the Union of Radical Lefts and Socialists. He joined the committees on Foreign Affairs and on Public Works & Communications. He was reelected in the first round in 1932. Cabinet positions (1932‚Äì34) Frot (left), Joseph Paul-Boncour and Henri Ch√©ron leaving the √âlys√©e in 1933 Frot was under secretary of state for the president of the council from 18 December 1932 to 28 January 1933 in the cabinet of Joseph Paul-Boncour. He was Minister of Merchant Marine from 31 January 1933 to 24 October 1933 in the cabinet of √âdouard Daladier. He was Minister of Labor and Social Assurance from 26 October 1933 to 23 November 1933 in the cabinet of Albert Sarraut. He was Minister of Merchant Marine from 26 November 1933 to 9 January 1934. He was Minister of Labor and Social Assurance from 9 January 1934 to 27 January 1934. Minister of interior (30 January 1934 ‚Äì 7 February 1934) On 30 January 1934 Frot was appointed Minister of the Interior in Daladier's new cabinet. Right wing groups began rumors that Frot was the leader of a group of Daladier's ministers who aimed to establish a \\"dictatorship of the left\\". These groups organized a street demonstration on 6 February 1934 in Paris that turned into a riot. The police opened fire on the demonstrators. Fourteen were killed, 57 received bullet wounds and 655 were injured. One policeman was killed. Frot remained at the Ministry of the Interior that evening trying to track what was happening, but was handicapped by wildly inaccurate reports that did not mention civilian casualties but stressed violence against the police. Daladier, several ministers and senior officials gathered at the Ministry of the Interior, where Frot recommended declaration of a state of siege, preventative arrests and a ban on arms sales. He was opposed by Charles Donat-Guigue, the attorney general, on various legal and constitutional grounds. After Donat-Guigue left Frot gave Perrier, the head of police intelligence, authority to arrest extreme right and extreme left leaders other than municipal councilors, members of parliament, journalists and ancien combattants. After the others had left, Frot requisitioned army units, launched investigations against the right-wing leaders Charles Maurras and Maurice Pujo, called for an interim ban on all public demonstrations and informed the press and radio of the measures taken. He said \\"Tomorrow we may have to defend order again; we will do so for France and the Republic.\\" The police were not effective in their preventative arrests. They could not find Pujo. Maurras, who was soundly sleeping, did not open his door. The Garde R√©publicaine and the police were demoralized, blaming the authorities for the trouble as much as the crowds. The next morning Frot received reports that the demonstrations would resume, with the protesters now carrying guns and grenades. He was told the Croix-de-Feu and Action Fran√ßaise were coordinating their actions, and the latter had condemned Frot to death. Frot sent a message to Daladier recommending that he resign to avoid civil war. Frot resigned, and at 1:30 pm Daladier also resigned. Deputy (1934‚Äì41) In the aftermath the Action Fran√ßaise journal accused Daladier, Frot, Pierre Cot and L√©on Blum of having attempted a coup d'√©tat, and called for them to be punished for the massacre of innocents. Frot was accused of having ordered his armed agents to fire on unarmed people. He was called the \\"minister with bloody hands\\" and \\"Frot the executioner\\" (Frot-le-fusilleur). He was ostracized by his colleagues. A group called the \\"Avocats du 6 F√©vrier\\", members of the Camelots du Roi, tried to prevent Frot working as an attorney, and started fights whenever Frot entered the Palais de Justice. When Frot campaigned in 1935 for the Popular Front he was harassed by Camelots wherever he spoke in France. Nevertheless, Frot was reelected in the first round on 26 April 1936. He sat with the Socialist and Republican Union, but was less active in the chamber. Frot vacillated in his political positions. The pacifist L√©on Emery stated at the 1935 congress of the Ligue des droits de l'homme, \\"Parliament has, in the last twenty years, done nothing for democracy ... the distrinction between fascist states and democratic ones is merely a question of degree and not a fundamental one.\\" Frot spoke out against this position, saying \\"parliament is, after all ... the reflection of the wishes of universal suffrage.\\" This drew boos that forced him to leave the podium. By the late 1930s he had joined the extreme pacifists. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) he voted on 10 July 1940 in favor of the constitutional law that gave full powers to Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Later career (1941‚Äì83) Frot published articles in Ren√© Ch√¢teau's collaborationist paper France Socialiste. He agreed to sit in the Vichy National Council, but soon resigned, and in 1941 refused to enter the government of Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan. In 1941‚Äì42 he wrote a number of articles that defended the Republic. He helped the Nord movement but did not actively participate in the French Resistance. After the Liberation of France the jury of honor declared he was ineligible for elective office due to his vote on 10 July 1940. He resumed his career as an attorney for a short period, then became involved in company management. Eug√®ne Frot died on 10 April 1983 in Ch√¢teau-Landon, Seine-et-Marne.

Biography  Wilhelm Neumann-Torborg grew up in Wuppertal, Germany, the son of a school headmaster. He attended evening classes at the Royal Provincial Vocational School in Elberfeld, where he received his first lessons in drawing and painting. He spent the years 1874 and 1877 studying in Bad Kreuznach, in the sculpture workshop of the brothers Robert and Karl Cauer. He then further developed his craft in 1878 under Melchior zur Strassen in the Leipzig Academy of Visual Arts and until 1880 in the Academy of Arts, Berlin with Otto Knille and Fritz Schaper. In 1885, he won the Rome Scholarship from the Prussian Academy of Arts for his thesis, \\"The Judgment of Paris\\". In subsequent years, Neumann-Torborg lived and worked in Rome, where his wife, Emma Commichau, died after a short marriage. In 1892, the artist returned to Berlin. In 1917, he fell seriously ill and died during a visit to his hometown of Elberfeld. His tomb is located in the Lutheran cemetery in Wuppertal-Elberfeld.

Perhaps his best- known work, the fountain \\"Faun and Nymph\\", was commissioned by Baron August von der Heydt and originally stood in the park of his estate. It survived the Second World War unscathed and since 1909 has been on display in Bad Godesberg, Bonn. In 2013, it was restored and moved to a new location to permit greater public access. Another relief of Neuman-Torborg's, showing dancing youths with Bacchus, was installed in the Bad Godesberg city park in 2014. The sculpture includes a bench and a bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus, and was recovered in pieces from the van der Heydt estate. The \\"Elberfeld Poor Relief Monument\\" was destroyed during the war, when the bronze figures were melted down for metal. In 2003, the granite pedestal of the monument was rediscovered during excavations at the Elberfeld Old Reformed Church, and placed on display in Blankstrasse, Wuppertal. In 2011, it was restored thanks to 24 private donations. The bronze figures were recast at the Kayser Art Foundry in D√ºsseldorf. The statue commemorates the inauguration, in 1853, of the Elberfeld system of poor relief, which was copied by many cities in subsequent years.

In 2013, at 21 years old, Diaz defected from Holguin, Cuba to Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic alongside his childhood friend Leandro Linares and another unnamed individual.

After batting .458 (22-for-48) with a 1.252 OPS during spring training, and after injuries to other players forced the Indians to adjust their roster, D√≠az was named the Indians' starting third baseman for the start of the 2017 season.

Many webcomics have been influenced by video games and video game culture. Background Webcomics frequently poke fun at video game logic, the video game industry, and stereotypical behavior of gamers. The earliest video game webcomic was Polymer City Chronicles, which started in 1995. However, 1998's PvP is seen as the origin of the genre, influencing various webcomics following it. Low-quality video game webcomics were particularly common in the mid-2000s, often featuring author stand-ins with poor dialogue and unrealistic relationships. A common trope in video game webcomics is to have the main characters sit on a couch, talking about the game they are playing. It is common for webcomics to exclusively use in-game art and speech bubbles, such as in sprite comics. The term gamics has been proposed by Nathan Ciprick in 2004 to refer to webcomics that consist entirely of video game graphics. Despite the fact that video game graphics are generally copyrighted, owners of the intellectual properties used have traditionally been tolerant.

The primary educational programs at AUSOM were: a two-year premed course of study; a four-year medical curriculum, which led to a Doctor of Medicine degree; and a six-year track that combined the premed and medical training. In addition to theoretical and academic training, students were required to complete 48 weeks of clinical clerkships. Students participated in community health clinics from their first year of study, offering basic health checks, diabetes screenings, and basic eye examinations. Accreditation Atlantic University School of Medicine received approval from the St. Lucian Cabinet in 2010. It was not accredited by the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP). On February 14, 2018, the Antigua Daily Observer printed an article containing claims by AUSOM administrators that the school was now CAAM-HP approved. By December 2017 the school had already closed. On February 19, 2018 CAAM-HP responded with a statement on the Disclaimer section of their website headed \\"False Claim made in the Antigua Daily Observer about the Accreditation of Atlantic University School of Medicine\\".

It was founded by director Rama Narayanan. History Rama Narayanan set up Sri Thenandal Films in 1976 in Chennai, and the studio has gone on to distribute over 750 films across India. Sri Thenandal Films is one of the few producers in Tamil cinema to survive beyond 100 productions along with AVM, Modern Theatres, Gemini Studios, etc. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Sri Thenandal Films produced and distributed a series of devotional films directed by Rama Narayanan. The quick spate of releases titled after goddesses such as Palayathu Amman (2000), Nageswari (2001), Kottai Mariamman (2001) and Annai Kaligambal (2003), saw the studio garner an image of focussing solely on Hindu devotional subjects. In the 2010s, Murali Ramaswamy made a decision to actively purchase and distribute horror films, and experienced immediate success after Aranmanai (2014), Kanchana 2 (2015), Demonte Colony (2015) and Maya (2015) all became profitable ventures. The success of the studio's investment in that particular genre prompted them to finance smaller budget horror films including Strawberry (2015) and Jackson Durai (2016), in attempt to capitalise on the popularity of the genre across Tamil Nadu. The studio also ventured into the production of stage plays under the leadership of Murali's wife, Hema Rukmani, in 2015, and financed Chillu, a futuristic science fiction play, performed in Chennai. Hema Rukmani is the current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the production house. Following the release of Atlee's Theri, Sri Thenandal Films signed Vijay and Atlee for another project together titled Mersal for their 100th movie in September 2016. Following the release of Mersal, the studio faced financial problems and cancelled several projects that they were associated with. A proposed high budget fantasy drama titled Sangamithra directed Sundar C entered pre- production and was promoted at the Cannes Film Festival as one of India's most expensive films. The film, which was set to star Jayam Ravi, Arya and Disha Patani in the lead roles, went through multiple changes in its cast and budget before being postponed indefinitely. Ananda Krishnan's Furthermore, Ashwin Saravanan's Iravaakaalam with S. J.

In Cameroon he made hundreds of wells, built hospitals, founded schools and organized workshops to improve the knowledge of women from different communities. In 2008, the town council in La Garriga honoured him as Illustrious Citizen. Biography Early life Jordi Mas was born in La Garriga (Vall√®s Oriental) on 14 March 1930. At 24 he was ordained and his first destinations as vicar were Esplugues de Llobregat, la Geltr√∫ (Vilanova i la Geltr√∫) and the Miraculosa parish in Barcelona. In 1961 he left as a missionary to a much harder scenery, which he himself chose: first some cities in the south of Cameroon and later in the Far North Region of the country in the wide Sahel strip. His last towns were Makary and Blangoua, close to lake Chad, in Muslim black Africa. From 1961 to 2010 he worked supporting his small congregations and helping them in educational, healthy and social areas. Missionary career When he arrived he realized those people didn‚Äôt need a missionary ‚Äîas they were mostly either animists or Muslims‚Äî but they needed his help in their most basic needs such as food, water, health, education... :‚ÄùI have no solution. It‚Äôs up to those in power to find it at a global level. Yet, it would be stupid just to think that, as you cannot solve it all, it is not worth doing anything. The world is single country to which we all belong as citizens. You find out that to face such basic needs you must get down to work for their development. First you must live, then you can philosophize‚Äù. Jordi Mas Castells, missionary Jordi Mas, next to a well in Makary (Far North Region, Cameroon) Progressively he specialized in building wells which stopped villagers, particularly girls, the weakest ones in that society, from walking long distances to get water to drink for both their families and cattle. During his long stay in the country he built hundreds of them. Mas was also aware that health was one of the weaknesses of the region. Therefore, together with the Swiss doctor Giuseppe Maggi (1910-1988) he founded the hospitals of Tokomb√©r√© (1962), Zina (1970) and Mada (1978).In the latter, a heath reference center, he worked driving patients in a jeep-ambulance for many years, a job which enabled him to get to know the territory and, mainly, to be close to the 250,000 inhabitants living in the surroundings of the hospital, a vast area of about 200 kilometres including four countries: Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. In 1988 when doctor Maggi died, Jordi Mas went on to school founding, as it was evident for him that people without education have neither hope nor future. As a result of this work in 1998 he opened the big professional school of Blangoua CEFAVIHAR (Educational centre for the improvement of life in rural areas), next to lake Chad. In this school, which also includes a student residence promoted by Mans Unides, about forty youngsters from the villages near the lake can learn mechanics, electricity, welding, carpentry, business managering, sewing, typing, computer studies... Besides there is a primary school with 500 pupils which was created thanks to the collaboration of some Catalan organizations grouped together in the charity Makary-Blangoua In recent years, Mas focused on the home FEMAK (Femmes de Makary) (2008), a meeting point for women of all religions in the region of Makary to relate, learn and exchange experiences. They had sewing workshops, computers and vegetable gardens and classrooms where they received education about health, eating habits and cooking. :‚ÄùThe future of Africa is women‚Äôs hands. They have always been understimated, but they have an enormous capacity and potential and they will make Africa develop‚Äù Jordi Mas Castells, missionary Jordi Mas, at the Mada Hospital (Far North Region, Cameroon) His great knowledge of the region was crutial in other projects: accommodation for the teachers in Blangoua, the FEMAK home and the residence for charity workers in Makary (2008)... The last project he was keen to develop in 2009 was the growing of a seaweed rich in proteins called spirulina, which grows really well in areas like lake Chad. Later life In 2010 he fell ill and travelled to La Garriga to undergo the treatment which enabled him to go back to his home in Makary. However, he died on Thursday 18 November that year. He is buried in La Doma cemetery, in La Garriga. Jordi Mas died, but his work is fully alive helping the people near the lake. Nowadays, November 2015, the Italian Fabio Musi, a long term Cameroon resident, is responsible for the general coordination of the different parishes and schools. He does it from Maroua, the Far North Region capital city of the country. In the last two parishes where the priest from La Garriga worked, namely Makary and Blangoua, there are two native priests in charge.  Awards received  * Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (2000) awarded by King Juan Carlos I of Spain a proposal by the Spanish ambassador in Cameroon.

The Anita Krajnc case refers to the case of Toronto resident Anita Krajnc who was charged with criminal mischief for giving water to pigs in a slaughter truck on the way to Fearman's Pork Inc. slaughterhouse, located in Burlington, Greater Toronto Area. This incident occurred on June 22, 2015, and Krajnc was found not guilty on May 4, 2017. Background Anita Krajnc is a co-founder of Toronto Pig Save. She holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of Toronto. Her doctoral thesis was based on the role of scientific knowledge and public education in building international environmental regimes. Krajnc has been Assistant Professor at Queen's University. She has also been a media democracy activist and a writer. She was an aide to Charles Caccia, former Minister of Environment. Incident The related incident occurred on June 22, 2015, outside Fearman's Pork Inc. slaughterhouse in Burlington. The protest was undertaken by Toronto Pig Save, a group to which Krajnc, who is described as an animal rights activist, belongs. Krajnc and her group were providing water to pigs in trucks transporting them to slaughter, as they stopped at a traffic island at the intersection of Appleby Line and Harvester Road, through the vents on the sides of the truck. As they were doing so, a driver of one of the trucks, got down and went to her and asked her to stop. Krajnc recited a verse from the biblical Book of Proverbs: \\"If they are thirsty, give them water\\". In response the driver told her that the pigs weren't human. Krajnc asked the driver to be compassionate; he said he would call the police, Krajnc suggested that she would call Jesus. The driver then walked away, boarded the truck and drove on. This interaction was filmed by Krajnc's associates. The police report on the incident described the contents of the bottle as \\"an unknown liquid\\". On June 23, 2015, Eric van Boekel, from whose farm the pigs were brought, filed a case against Krajnc. On September 9, 2015, Krajnc was charged with criminal mischief, the penalty for which ranges from a fine to 10 years in prison. In response, the group arranged a vigil on September 24. On October 14, 2015, Krajnc appeared in court for an arraignment, to have charges read to her. In the context of the case The Daily Telegraph reports that under Canadian law pigs are considered property and can be transported without food and water for 36 hours. Krajnc has said that she would refuse to pay any fine and that she was willing to suffer imprisonment. The driver of the truck stated that though the activists were entitled to protest, his objection was to them interfering with his delivery and touching his truck (which may jeopardise the protester's own safety). He considers the charges justifiable. He said that the pigs were loaded an hour before the incident and argued that it was unlikely they were dehydrated. Metro printed a rebuttal from Bob Comis, a former breeder who stated that the pigs as seen in a video of the incident showed symptoms of \\"severe heat stress\\". Eric van Boekel, in support of his complaint, said, \\"They don't have the right to involve other people's property and they don't have the right to protest illegally\\". He stated that rules set by pig breeders regarding food and water were followed by his operations. Krajnc has stated that treating living animals such as pigs as property ‚Äì \\"no different than a toaster\\" ‚Äì is the focal issue of the matter and that being compassionate to them should not be considered criminal.  Trial  The case was heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and presided over by Justice David Harris. Closing arguments in the trial were made on March 9, 2017. Justice David Harris found Krajnc not guilty of criminal mischief on May 4, 2017, judging that a crime had not occurred because simply giving water to the pigs did not constitute interference \\"with the operation, enjoyment or use of\\" the pigs by their owners as argued by the Crown. Harris also dismissed the argument that Krajnc's actions created a safety risk via possible contamination, finding that the driver had delivered the pigs immediately afterwards with no mention of the incident because he did not think there was a real risk and that in the past, despite knowing that the pigs had been given water, abattoirs had never refused them. Harris dismissed the testimony of two defendant's expert witnesses as unobjective and also found that one of them had been \\"less than scientific\\". But he chastised the defence team for making attention-grabbing statements comparing Krajnc to Mandela, Gandhi, Susan B. Anthony, and those who had helped Jews during the Holocaust. Reactions Several online petitions sprung up including one called Compassion Isn't a Crime that had 125,500 signatures, and another asking the Ontario Court of Justice to drop charges against Krajnc had over 24,000. The Daily Telegraph called Krajnc's case a cause c√©l√®bre for animal welfare activists\\". Other incidents On October 4, 2016, Krajnc was arrested on charges of obstructing police and breaching her bail conditions for the 2015 incident, after a truck heading to the slaughterhouse overturned. Police had taped off part of the street and Krajnc was arrested after she \\"walked past the police tape more than once, and did not follow police directions to stop what she was doing\\". In June 2020, Regan Russell was accidentally killed by an animal transport truck while attending one of Krajnc's Toronto Pig Save protests at the same slaughterhouse.

Story The story of Rani Sati Dadi Maa starts from the time of Mahabharata. Narayani's wish of being married to Abhimanyu and her desire to be sati in her next life. As granted by Lord Krishna, in her next life she was born as the daughter of Gursamal Birmewal in the village of Dokwa in Rajasthan and was named Narayani. Abhimanyu was born in Hissar as a son of Jaliram Jalan and named Tandhan Jalan. Tandan and Narayani got married and were leading a peaceful life. He was in possession of a beautiful horse which was being eyed by the son of king of Hissar for quite some time. Tandhan refused to hand over his precious horse to the king's son. The king's son then decides to forcefully acquire the horse and thus challenges Tandan to a duel. Tandan fights the battle bravely and kills the king's son. The enraged king thus kills Tandan in front of Narayani in the battle. Narayani, symbolic of female bravery and power, fights with the king and kills him. She then commanded Ranaji (the caretaker of the horse) to make immediate arrangements for her to be set ablaze along with her husband's cremation. Ranaji, playing a vital role in fulfilling her wish to be sati with her husband, is then blessed by Narayani that his name will be taken and worshiped along with her name and since then she is known as Rani Sati. Temple A gallery within the temple The temple is notable for not holding any paintings or statues of either female or male gods. Instead a trishul depicting power and force is worshipped religiously by the followers. A portrait of Rani Sati dadiji is located in the pradhan mand.

It was written by Harley, Jim Cregan and Robert Hart, and produced by Harley. The song is Harley's first new song of five years, following the release of his 2010 album Stranger Comes to Town. Background \\"Ordinary People\\" was originally written and performed by Jim Cregan and Robert Hart as a demoed track, who handed the recording to Harley in 2010. Although Harley did nothing with the song for five years, in 2015, he gained the support of Cregan and Hart to develop the song further. The song, in an early incarnation, was first performed live by Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel during their Autumn/Winter 2014 tour at the York Barbican on 13 December. During this airing, Harley revealed the song was a \\"work in progress\\". The next performance of the song live was at Hull City Hall on 26 February 2015. In an online diary entry, dated 13 January, Harley noted: \\"Next show: Hull City Hall ‚Äì complete with new song. Well, the same new song we played at York Barbican, but with a twist. I said it was a work in progress, and now it has a separate section, a middle eight.\\" In June 2015, Harley spent several days in the Shrubbery Studio at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, recording \\"Ordinary People\\". Harley used his touring band Cockney Rebel to record the song, while the studio's owner Richard Clark engineered it.http://www.theshrubberyrecordings.com/staff The song was bassist Marty Prior's debut performance on a Steve Harley song, having joined the band in 2014. During the sessions, assistant engineer George Perks had posted a photograph to his official website, and announced: \\"Honoured to be in the Shrubbery studio this month with Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel, assisting the recording of \\"Ordinary People\\". The new single sounds great, and has been sent over to producer extraordinaire Matt Butler for mixing. I'm really excited to hear the final mix! Stay tuned...!\\" It was announced that month that the song would be released as a single nearer the time of the upcoming The Best Years of Our Lives tour in November. Harley hoped that the song would gain airplay on UK radio and act as a publicity boost for the tour. In Harley's online diary entry for 22 June, he wrote: \\"We spent a few days in a recording studio recently, and \\"Ordinary People\\" came out sounding like a potential R2 play- lister... if only! I've added an extra 12 bars of new melody and lyric (a Middle 8, which is actually 12).\\" It was also revealed that the digital recording files had been sent via Ethernet to Matt Butler, who would re-mix the song using Pro-tools. The single's release was first announced outside of the official website in the Southend Echo on 15 July, with the article noting that the single was still in the process of being remixed and prepared for release at that time. During an interview on the BBC Radio 2 show Steve Wright in the Afternoon, in November 2015, Harley explained how the song was developed: In an interview with Phoenix FM, backstage at the Brentwood Music Festival in July 2015, Harley also spoke of the song's development: The song has been described by Harley as \\"Beatle-esque\\". Speaking to Classic Rock in October 2015, Harley revealed: \\"It's a cri de coeur ‚Äì I'm speaking for the little man, as it were. It's not John Lennon, but as I get older I'm not ashamed to wear my heart on my sleeve.\\" Speaking of the song's chances of getting airplay on BBC Radio 2, he added: \\"The new single from Cliff Richard is on the A-list, and they play David Gilmour, but it's tough. I'd love it if Radio 2 played my single ‚Äì half the world and its grandmother thinks I only wrote one song. If it had the right name stuck to it I think they would play it.\\" Speaking to the East Anglian Daily Times in November 2015, Harley spoke of the song and its release: Release \\"Ordinary People\\" was made available as a pre-order digital single on 5 September 2015. It was released on 25 September. The song was not given a full commercial release on any physical format. The single's artwork features a close-up photograph of Harley, taken by Mike Callow. A promotional one-track CD release of the single was later issued with an \\"impact\\" date of 27 November, specifically for radio station use. As an exclusive for radio, the promotional CD features a \\"Radio Edit\\" version of the song, which has a shortened introduction and first verse, and is approximately 20 seconds shorter than the full version. The CD features the same artwork as the digital version for a picture sleeve, housed in a plastic wallet, with a record company information sticker placed on the rear side. The physical format release was limited to 150 copies, and was issued by Comeuppance Ltd and promoted by All About Promotions. The song was given its first play on 3 October, on BBC Radio Scotland's Billy Sloan Show. On 8 October, it received its first play on the Norwegian Oslo Radio, and on 21 October, it had its first BBC Radio 2 airing on Vanessa Feltz's show, followed with a play on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on 9 November. On 7 November 2015, an official video of the song being performed live was uploaded onto YouTube. The footage was recorded during the Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel tour of that same month. Critical reception Upon release, Andrew Thomas of The Westmorland Gazette reviewed the single, describing the song as \\"deceptively simple\\" and \\"of the type that you need years of experience to pull off so well\\". He commented on the \\"Beatles/George Harrison feel\\", Harley's \\"rich and assured vocals\\" and the \\"straightforward but heartfelt lyrics - a plea for ordinary people to band together and show their essential humanity to try to make the world a better place\\". He concluded \\"Ordinary People\\" was \\"a very mature song which grows on you with each listen\\". Reviewing the band's November 2015 concert at Scunthorpe Baths Hall, Scunthorpe Telegraph noted the song's inclusion within the set-list, commenting how \\"at the age of 64, Steve is still making great music\\". Another similar review on the band's Liverpool Philharmonic show, for the Wirral Globe, saw reporter Peter Grant comment: \\"We were treated to \\"Ordinary People\\" ‚Äì Steve's new single which is, he says, unashamedly Beatle-esque\\". When giving the song its first play on BBC Radio Scotland, Billy Sloan commented: \\"There's a brand new song which I think really is a fantastic piece of work, and I hope you agree. One of Steve Harley's best vocals in a long-long time, and that really is saying something when you consider his incredible back-catalogue\\". After playing the song on his BBC Radio 2 show, presenter Steve Wright commented that the song was \\"highly familiar\\", and that it \\"really does sound like a song I've heard before\\". After being played on Oslo Radio, the song received positive feedback from listeners.

The butte is a dark-colored mountain, the site of a former mine, and the site of a former post office. Little River joins Big River a few miles downstream to form the Coast Fork Willamette River. On older maps, Little River appears as a tributary of Garoutte Creek, also known as Saroutte Creek. However, in 1988 the United States Board on Geographic Names renamed the lower reach of Garoutte Creek so that it became part of Little River. The change rendered the upper reach of Garoutte Creek a tributary of Little River. The only named tributary of Garoutte Creek is Carlson Creek, which enters from the left. Post office The Black Butte Mine, developed by S. P. Garoutte in the 1890s, led to the establishment of a post office at Black Butte. William Harris was the first postmaster, and the office, established in 1898, was known by his last name, Harris. The name was changed in 1901 to Blackbutte. It operated under that name until permanently closing in 1957. Pollution In the 21st century, the former mine and the area around it have become a Superfund site. The Environmental Protection Agency is concerned about methylmercury contamination of streams including Garoutte Creek, the Little River, and the Coast Fork, as well as the Cottage Grove Reservoir on the Coast Fork. During its heyday, the mine was the second-largest mercury producer in Oregon. From 1900 to 1957, it yielded a total of 16,904 flasks of elemental mercury; equivalent to about .

He was an ex- husband of Jiang Qing, who later married Mao Zedong, and the father of Yu Qiangsheng, a top Chinese intelligence officer who defected to the United States in 1985, and Yu Zhengsheng, the fourth-ranked member of the 18th Politburo Standing Committee. Early life and revolution Huang Jing making a speech from a tram during the December 9th Movement in 1935 Yu Qiwei was born in 1912 to a prominent family in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province. His uncle Yu Ta-wei later served as Minister of National Defense of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The chemist Zeng Zhaolun was also his uncle. Yu enrolled in Shandong University in Qingdao, majoring in physics. At the same time, he spent significant amount of time in underground political activism for the Communist Party of China. While in Qingdao, Huang Jing met and married Li Yunhe (who would later change her name to \\"Jiang Qing\\" and marry Mao Zedong), in 1932. Huang introduced the 19-year-old Li to join the Communist Party in 1933. Soon afterwards, Huang was arrested by the government for his Communist activism. To avoid implicating Li, he sent a message asking her to leave him. Li was introduced to Shanghai film director Shi Dongshan, who was in Qingdao at the time, and followed Shi to Shanghai. After Huang's release in 1934, he lived with Li for a while with his family in Shanghai. However, Huang's family was adamantly against their marriage, and they became separated. In 1935, Huang Jing, then attending Peking University, co-led the December 9th Movement with Yao Yilin and Huang Hua, demanding the Chinese government to actively resist Japanese aggression in the aftermath of the Mukden Incident. After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Huang moved to the Communist base in Yan'an in winter 1939. Li Yunhe, now known as Jiang Qing, had also moved to Yan'an and married the Communist leader Mao Zedong. Huang later became a department head in the Communist bases in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei (Jin-Cha-Ji) and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu) border areas. Political career Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Communists took over northern Hebei Province, and Huang was appointed Mayor of Zhangjiakou. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he became the Mayor of the Tianjin municipality, as well as the city's Communist Party Chief. In 1952, Huang was appointed Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, which was in charge of the civilian industry (the Second Ministry was in charge of military work). When the National Technological Commission was established in 1956, he became its first chairman. While serving in these capacities Huang praised the work of a young engineer in Shanghai named Jiang Zemin, the later General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, who recalled that Huang invited him to a banquet at the Quanjude duck restaurant, and on another occasion, talked to him for four hours until 11 pm. Huang Jing was considered a promising young star of the Communist Party, but was labelled a counterrevolutionary when the Anti-Rightist Campaign began in 1958. He died in Guangzhou that same year, at the age of only 46. The circumstances surrounding his death are unclear. It is said that he suffered from mental and physical diseases and died of heart disease in a military hospital. Family After his relationship with Jiang Qing ended, Huang Jing married the journalist Fan Jin, who later became vice mayor of Beijing and president of Beijing Daily. Their son, Yu Qiangsheng, was a top Chinese intelligence officer who defected to the United States in 1985. Another son, Yu Zhengsheng, rose to become one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee in 2012, which effectively rules China.

It is an urban, industry-focused campus, in the heart of the Silicon Forest located in the same vicinity as Silicon Forest technology companies such as Mentor Graphics, Rockwell Collins, FLIR, Microsoft, Xerox, Convergence, Tektronix and DWFritz. US News and Education World Report ranks Oregon Tech two in public schools in the west, fifth in regional colleges west and #12 in best value schools. In a 2019 report, the University was ranked in the upper 1 percent in the nation in PayScale's release of top colleges based on graduates' return on tuition and borrowing investments. The campus focuses heavily on renewable energy with a commitment to environmental sustainability within the city of Wilsonville and the Portland Metro area. It offers bachelor's and master's degrees in the fields of Clinical Laboratory Science and Paramedic Science in partnership with OHSU, and engineering, technology and management degrees in electrical and renewable energy engineering, electronics, embedded systems, manufacturing, mechanical, software engineering, computer science, information technology, operations management, and geomatics. Oregon Tech is also affiliated with the Oregon Manufacturing Innovation Center in Scappose, Oregon.  History  Oregon Tech's four locations in the Portland metropolitan area were consolidated into a single campus in 2012 at InFocus' former headquarters in Wilsonville following a rebranding campaign launched in the same year. The Oregon Tech Portland-Metro campus was officially operational in 2012. The last major renovations at this campus were complete in June, 2015. This included the addition of four new offices for staff on the second floor of the campus and the renovation of a classroom on the fourth floor. Minor improvements to individual classes and the usability of space and resources was still in process until early 2016 when resources to all departments had been allocated. The original In-Focus building began construction in 1999 and was completed in 2001. After purchasing the building from In-Focus in 2008, Oregon Tech planned to keep much of the original \\"modern\\" design and architecture. The Portland-Metro campus currently occupies the first, second and fourth floors of the building, while Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based aviation-electronics company, occupies the third floor. Plans for expansion of the Klamath Falls campus were discussed in 2007 and 2008 to merge the Portland area sites, allow for a threefold increase in the number of students it serves and spur the creation of new degrees in specialized scientific and technical fields. Wide angle lens of OT Wilsonville (2016) Wilsonville (Fall 2016) Oregon lawmakers approved using $20 million in lottery-backed bonds to cover two-thirds of the building's cost, $20.6 million to purchase the structure and $9.4 million for renovations and related costs. 200x200px200x200pxWhile offering many of the same programs that the Klamath campus has, there are two signature programs at this campus: medical lab sciences, in partnership with the Oregon Health and Science University, and renewable energy engineering. Current enrollment at this campus is about 750 to 1,000 students per term. Many undergraduate students typically intern and work professionally while working towards a degree..  End of the OUS (Oregon University System)  Portland State University, Oregon Tech and Oregon State University were the last holdouts of the Oregon University System before its legal abolishment in July 2015. The decision left Oregon state universities to be run by their own independent governing boards, such as Oregon Tech Klamath Falls which now governs all Oregon Tech campuses under an independent board. All records from the OUS have been transferred to the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC), which has more limited powers than OUS did.  Organization and Administration  The mission statement of Oregon Tech reads: > Oregon Institute of Technology (\\"Oregon Tech\\"), Oregon‚Äôs public polytechnic > university, offers innovative, professionally-focused undergraduate and > graduate degree programs in the areas of engineering, health, business, > technology, and applied arts and sciences. To foster student and graduate > success, the university provides a hands-on, project-based learning > environment and emphasizes innovation, scholarship, and applied research. > With a commitment to diversity and leadership development, Oregon Tech > offers statewide educational opportunities and technical expertise to meet > current and emerging needs of Oregonians as well as other national and > international constituents. Oregon Tech Portland-Metro is a public university governed by 13 publicly appointed board of trustees at the Klamath Falls campus. It is still under the umbrella of the Oregon Tech oversight and is allotted separate funding from Klamath Falls.  Campus life  Oregon Tech Portland-Metro is situated around several technology companies which periodically enroll employees into the universities' student body as well as pool new graduates. Students typically purchase food from a micro market in the Student Commons or walk to either Argyle square or the Wilsonville city center.200x200px  Library  200x200px The campus has a library located on the fourth floor. The library houses approximately 1200 volumes and has access to all electronic resources that the university subscribes to. Students may also checkout items through Summit from more than 37 different university library campuses in the Pacific Northwest. The library has seven rooms that students can check out for studying or for group collaboration and functions as the hub for many school and industry related projects around campus.  Tutoring  Oregon Tech has a free and open tutoring service for students dubbed \\"Peer Consulting\\" which is located on the fourth floor, opposite of the campus library. The objective of the center is to have students who have a 'B' or higher in their classes assist their peers by providing direction in their study or work. The Peer Consulting center is unique because it attempts to de-stigmatize academic assistance, provide a space for students to ask questions and connect with their peers.  Intel workstation donation  200x200px Intel donated the workstation computers on the fourth floor of the campus and an Atom workstation in 2012 for ESET students.  Student Life Traditions   Annual Events  = Healthy Active Challenge = The Healthy Active Challenge provide a fun and competitive way for students to meet their own personal nutrition, fitness and lifestyle goals in an effort to enhance their overall well being. The event runs during the spring term and features health presentations, weekly prizes and an end of competition party. = Student Project Symposium = This official university event at the Portland-Metro campus allows students to showcase the projects that students conduct during their studies. The event is held annually towards the end of Spring term, and it provides an opportunity for students from different programs to share their work, as well as get to see other projects. 200x200px The Symposium includes project posters, demonstrations, and oral presentations and typically lasts two hours long. Students, faculty, family members, employers, educational and industry partners, as well as members of the public typically attend each year.  Pranks  Around 2013, after Oregon Tech purchasing the old Wilsonville building from InFocus, rumors of the University of Oregon purchasing the building and converting it into a \\"flagship tech-focused\\" campus arose among the staff, despite there being no hard evidence to support this rumor. A picture of a duck pushing an owl out from a building, presumed to be the Wilsonville Campus, was found in the student commons and was later removed. = Rivalry with Caltech = Since mid-2012, Oregon Tech and Caltech have been rivals after Oregon Tech rebranded from its stylized OIT logo and focused on being the number one institute of technology on the West Coast. On September 18, 2014, students handed out shirts in the first floor commons to newly admitted students that read \\"Caltack on Titan\\" on the front and an image of a beaver, Caltech's mascot, running away in fear while Hootie, Oregon Tech's mascot, plays a Fender Telecaster guitar. On December 10, 2015, a cardboard cutout of Sheldon from the Big Bang theory sporting the thumbs-up sign was placed in the stairway leading to Rockwell Collins with a speech- bubble that read, \\"Oregon Tech. It's above California Tech. That's why I moved!\\" The prank was presumably a pun on the newly aired Oregon State Lottery commercial \\"All things Oregon.\\"  ASOIT  Associated Students of Oregon Institute of Technology (ASOIT) is the student government on campus. ASOIT helps coordinate programs, clubs and events to enhance the quality of life for students and promote community on campus.  Active Clubs  The following are clubs that maintain an active presence on campus and are a registered club in accordance with ASIOT (Associated Students of Oregon Tech). OT Wilsonville Rapid Prototyping Room  3D Print Club  Oregon Tech Wilsonville has a 3D print club which actively aids student projects and other clubs. Since its founding in early 2014, the 3D print club supports all students' projects; however, students are required to provide materials if it is not for a class.  IEEE Oregon Tech Wilsonville  This club is part of the Oregon Institute of Technology Portland-Metro Student Branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  Society of Women Engineers   Hyperion International  The Hyperion International club works with the Foundation \\"Solar HOPE\\" (non-profit) dedicated to providing renewable energy solutions to underdeveloped regions of the world. Named after the Titan god of light and traveling internationally, the club installs solar systems at schools, hospitals, and orphanages where there is little or no electricity. This brings opportunities for lights, water pumping, phone/computer charging, vaccination refrigeration and more.  Tech Owls in Action  The purpose of TOA is to bring together students with interest in clean energy to provide development in leadership, professional, and project planning abilities, access to clean energy information, at least one clean energy event on campus, and to ultimately exercise teamwork to implement student led solutions that benefit the Wilsonville community.  Gravity and Space (GRASP)  GRASP Research is an organization that facilitates and conducts space experiments. It brings students and faculty of diverse backgrounds together to carry out various hands-on aerospace projects. As of March 2016, Oregon Tech Wilsonville has started partnering with SpaceX to test new designs and projects.  Other Clubs  * Technologists in Training * Graduate Student Organization * OWL Veterans Organization * International Energy Club * Inventors Club * Outdoor Club  Academics  In their 2020 report U.S. News & World Report considers Oregon Tech to be the #6 Public University in the regional West part of the United States. Forbes in 2019 rated Oregon Tech #423 in Top Colleges, #143 in public colleges, #82 among all West Coast universities and #217 in best value collegeshttps://www.forbes.com/colleges/oregon-institute-of- technology/#23feeeae48e5 considers it to be \\"innovative\\" and \\"very competitive.\\" The Wilsonville Oregon Tech campus was officially operational in 2012 and is located on Parkway Avenue in the remodeled InFocus building. The last major renovations at this campus were complete in winter 2019-20 with the addition of new offices for staff on the forth floor of the campus and the renovation of the student Commons to create additional recreational space for students. The Wilsonville campus currently occupies the first, second and fourth floors of the building, while Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based aviation- electronics company, occupies the third floor. Engineering degrees at the university are accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET. Oregon Tech graduates success rate is 97.5% graduate success, which is defined as being employed or continuing an educational path, within six months of receiving a degree and the average starting salary for an Oregon Tech graduate is $60,000 per year.\\"  Institution Philosophies  Oregon Tech Portland-Metro prides itself in having student-to-faculty ratio of approximately 14:1, allowing the staff to have a personal connection with the student as they make an individual progression towards a degree. The Portland- Metro campus has a focus on a hands-on learning style, \\"... guided by a willingness to try, fail, learn, and try again, is one that encourages students to dream big and set high standards with measurable goals for themselves.\\" Oregon Tech also favors hiring faculty members with decades of experience in professional settings and \\"understanding of principles that will guide our graduates both to short-term successes in the workforce and long- term successes in their chosen professions\\" according to the University. The university is noted as having the highest return on investment (ROI) of any colleges or universities in Oregon according to the 2019 April Payscale report.  Access to Campus   Transportation and housing  The Portland-Metro campus does not offer housing since many students live in surrounding cities such as Clackamas, Portland, Wilsonville, Tigard and Tualatin. Oregon Tech students can ride the S.M.A.R.T. (South Metro Area Transit) buses in Wilsonville and Portland to and from campus for free with a valid student ID.

He was described by one historian as \\"a flamboyant Birmingham mogul and New South industrialist.\\" Hailing from east Tennessee, in his early working years, Swann was a power salesman for the Alabama Power Company. He established the Federal Phosphorus Company to produce concentrated phosphoric acid, mainly for use as a concentrated fertilizer, using a novel method to produce the acid from phosphate rock by heat treatment in an electric furnace. He later established the Swann Chemical Company, focused on production of PCBs for the emergent electrical industry. Swann Chemical Company operated a chemical manufacturing plant in Anniston, Alabama where PCBs were first made on an industrial scale after development of a new process under Swann's leadership. In 1920, Swann gave his engineers the challenge of creating a process by which PCBs, up to that time very expensive and produced only in small quantities, could be produced in industrial quantities, and after much trial and error, they succeeded. The plant was later bought by Monsanto Industrial Chemicals Co. in 1935. The plant, just west of Anniston, had around 1,000 employees. One historian wrote that, \\"In many ways, the spirit of Swann Chemical became the corporate culture of Monsanto.\\" Swann's house in Birmingham, Alabama, built from 1927 to 1930, was at the time the largest residence in the city and cost $600,000 to build. While Monsanto became the most successful agrochemical corporation in the world, Swann began to slide into poverty. He was forced to sell his castle in 1945 when he filed for bankruptcy. He nearly made a comeback by selling a new design for a furnace to process iron ore to the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, but the dictator reneged after paying only a modest down payment.

The book was supported by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs as part of the country's Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarian Fund as a cultural outreach project. The announcement of support for these projects was made on 28 November 2012. > Northern Ireland is still a very divided society. We saw the potential for > sectarian activity to flare up again this summer, so it's clear that, > despite the enormous progress made since the Good Friday Agreement was > signed, great challenges remain.

It is described a true and transformational story of one woman's extraordinary journey from skepticism, through tragedy, into awakening to the knowledge that her dead fianc√© is communicating from the hereafter. The story recounts McCarthy's change in focus and career path, and how she moved toward Spiritualism and writing about spirituality as a result of these experiences. It was described by NYU Professor Ernest Rubeinstein as \\"a story that doesn't just save us from our fear of death but also from the vague uneasiness and sense of disconnection that sometimes infect a life.\\" It does this by emphasizing the existential implications of continued existence for this life and how joy and purpose come from having an open mind, an open heart, the courage to heal, and from being willing to embrace and share the compassion offered us from the unseen world. Feature article versions of the story appeared in the British magazine Psychic News and Salon.com. =Reception= In the first week of its release, Till Death Don't Us Part was ranked #1 New Release in its category on Amazon.

She underwent years of intensive training at Arthur Findlay College, a school of Spiritualism and the psychic sciences. She holds three awards, Certificates of Recognition, in mediumship, spiritual healing and public speaking from its governing body, the Spiritualist National Union.

He wrote a biography, published by American abolitionist Samuel Moore in 1854. His report is the only known document about the slave trade written by a former Brazilian slave.  Biography  Baquaqua was born in Djougou (currently in Benin) between 1820 and 1830 in a prominent Muslim trader family. He learned the Quran, literature and mathematics in an Islamic school. Still as an adolescent, he and his brother took part in the succession wars in Daboya, where he was captured and then rescued. Returning to Djougou, he became the servant of a local dignitary, perhaps the chief of Soubroukou, whom he called 'king'. The abuses he committed in that period made him target of an ambush in which he was imprisoned and transported to Dahomey; he was embarked into a slave ship in 1845 and taken to Pernambuco in Brazil. Baquaqua was a slave in Olinda, Pernambuco for around two years. His master was a baker. He worked in the construction of houses, carrying stones, learned Portuguese, and performed as an \\"escravo de tabuleiro\\" (peddling slave). The cruelty of his Brazilian masters made him resort to alcoholism and attempt suicide. Taken to Rio de Janeiro, Baquaqua was incorporated with the crew of the trade ship Lembran√ßa (\\"A Memory\\"), transporting goods to the southern provinces of Brazil. In 1847, a coffee shipment to the United States was his passport to freedom. The ship arrived in New York harbor in June, where it was approached by local abolitionists, who encouraged him to escape from the ship. After the escape, however, he was imprisoned in the local jail, and only the help of the abolitionists (who facilitated his escape from prison) prevented his return to the ship. He was then sent to Haiti, where he lived with the Reverend W. L. Judd, a Baptist missionary. Converted to Christianity and baptized in 1848, Baquaqua returned to the US due to the political instability in Haiti. He studied at the New York Central College in upstate New York for almost three years. In 1854, he moved to Canada; his autobiography was published the same year in Detroit by Samuel Downing Moore. It is not known what happened to Baquaqua after 1857. He was then in England and had turned to the American Baptist Free Mission Society to be sent as a missionary to Africa.

Gade from 1854. Gade's oeuvre contains many concert pieces of various lengths for orchestra, choir and soloists. Depending on which one counts, there are up to 16 of them, mostly referred to as \\"cantata\\". The longest of the pieces can take up to an hour. Some of the pieces are almost semi-operas or concert operas with dramatic development. Origins The plot of the song comes from the Danish folk-ballad Elveskud. In 1842 Gade wrote \\"Agnete og Havfruerne\\" for solo, female choir and orchestra with text by Hans Christian Andersen, and the same Andersen had in 1846 premiered the opera \\"Liden Kirsten\\" with music by Gade's father-in-law J. P. E. Hartmann. Both were inspired by Danish folksongs. This may have encouraged Gade to try his hand at the same set of motifs with a major concert piece. The earliest information on Elverskud is a mention in a letter from Gade in 1849, in which he wrote that he had allowed Hans Christian Andersen to prepare a text. For whatever reason it was never used by Gade, but a draft can be found among Andersen's papers. Some parts of the text were transferred to the final version. The next person who turned his hand to this text was Christian Molbech in whose papers there is a version that is closer to the final one, which by all accounts was developed by Gade's cousin Carl Andersen and the editor Gottlieb Siesby, while the atmospheric choral interlude \\"I √∏sten stiger solen op\\" was written already in 1837 by B. S. Ingemann and received a tune by C. E. F. Weyse the same year. The first sheet of Gade's score is dated December 12, 1851, but in March 1853 the work is mentioned a letter to Gade from his wife, suggesting that he had no time to work on it. In early 1854 the work was published in a piano arrangement by a German publisher as \\"Ballade nach d√§nischen Volkssagen\\". On 30 March 1854, it was first performed at a subscription concert at the Musikforeningen, presented as a ballad for soloist, choir and orchestra. Plot summary The ballad is divided into five sections, a prologue, three \\"acts\\" and an epilogue. * The prologue sets the scene: Sir Oluf has been seduced by some elf-maidens. * The first part starts with the chorus saying that Sir Oluf is to be married, but the situation goes awry when Oluf, to his mother's amazement, wants to ride out one night. He explains how he is torn between his golden-haired and blue-eyed bride-to-be and the elf-king's daughter, black-haired, bold and daring. Despite his mother's warnings, Oluf rides away. * The second part starts with Oluf's cautious ride through the dark and ominous forest where he meets the elf-maidens. The Elf King's daughter urges him to stay, but he refuses. She curses him, but he escapes and rides back home. * Part 3: the choir sings \\"I √∏sten stiger solen op\\" (\\"In the east the Sun Rises\\") and the mother is worried, but not yet aware of what has happened. As Oluf arrives, it is with death as a companion. * Epilogue: the choir sings the short moral that one should stay away from Elverh√∏j. The music Gade was apparently keen to emphasize that the music was not adaptations of folk songs, but rather all his own, but inspired by the ballads. Heard today, Elverskud fits the Danish romance style, particularly in the section where Oluf, the mother and the choir \\"talk\\" to each other in opera style. Elverskud has been shown to be one of the most popular Gade's works. According to a statement in Inger S√∏rensen's book, it was performed at least 184 times in Gade's life, a success unparalleled by other Danish composers. The work remains popular today, and two of the songs, \\"I √∏sten stiger solen op\\" and \\"S√• tit jeg rider mig under √∏\\" are often played as single pieces. Sources * Inger S√∏rensen: Niels W.

When the organization was created, the members made it an issue to function collectively rather than have an officer team or executive board, to encourage women's empowerment and not be discriminatory.104/6 Box 21, Folder: Archival Research WRAC History, NO.1 1972 Women's Resource Newsletter After WRAC had successfully established itself as a feminist group in the Iowa City community, it began to reach out to other oppressed groups, diversifying their human rights values to expand to groups including \\"people of color, people with disabilities, the elderly, and lesbians and gays.\\" Originally, as a source of education and entertainment, WRAC held workshops and programs such as counseling, divorce rights, abortion and birth control, women's health information, women's studies, self-defense, economics, etc. These workshops and programs were beneficial to all women involved with WRAC because of the knowledge they were obtaining. In the early 1980s, the Women Against Racism Committee (WAR) was formed as a branch of WRAC, and populated primarily by the members of WRAC, as well as other women in the Iowa City community. The original purpose of the organization was to critique the racism WRAC members perceived, and to raise awareness of the harmful effects of internalized racism. These actions evolved into the study of all forms of oppression, including sexism, disability-related discrimination, and homophobia, especially among colored women. As WAR grew in popularity, it brought in renowned speakers, such as Winona LaDuke and Natalie Wong to the University of Iowa campus to speak on behalf of the oppressed populations. In early April, 1989, WAR held its first and only national conference, \\"Parallels and Intersections: Racism and Other Forms of Oppression.\\" Participation in the Women Against Racism Committee declined throughout the 1990s until it was shut down in 1998.Women Against Racism Committee Records, Box 1, Iowa Women's Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City, Iowa Present day Programs WRAC offers services including counseling, scholarships, support groups, and a library containing resources that address financing, health care (women's health, abuse recovery, eating disorders), gender studies, LGBT studies, marriage, sex, parenting, feminism theory, domestic violence, single parenting, adoption, and literature.

One of WRAC's projects to fight sexual violence and increase safety was the Street Lighting and Safety Project. WRAC acted as an advisor to the Association of Student Women (ASW) and collaborated with them to complete the project. The goal of the Street Lighting and Safety Project was to have more street lights put in place around Iowa City to provide more lighting during the evenings and at night. WRAC and ASW began the project in 1976 and it was completed in 1980. The lights put up around the campus acted as a precursor to current lights and blue safety lights around campus today.

Research areas in this field include many different technologies, amongst which the chemical modifications of fibres are widely used. One important sector of application of the chemical modifications is the treatment of wood for giving it enhanced properties such as higher mechanical properties, water impermeability, less hygroscopicity, bacterial and fungal resistance. Transferring and adapting the technical knowledge on fibre modification available for the wood sector to the recycled paper sector is an innovative use of these chemical treatments which has been the subject of studies that have been carried out within an EU co- funded project called Fibre+.7th Framework Program ‚Äì SME-AGs funding scheme ‚Äì Grant Agreement n¬∞ 315633 ‚Äì http://www.fibreplus.org The project Consortium included members representing Paper and Packaging European Associations (CEPI, FEFCO), and research institutes specialized in the wood and paper for packaging sector and paper and packaging companies. The focus of the project was on chemical modification of the paper made recycled fibres, investigating the possibility to transfer wood fibre modifications technique from the wood sector to paper and packaging sector. The aim was to enhance the properties of papers and of the packaging, as the recycling process causes the deterioration of fibres. The chemical modification of recycled fibres aimed at the creation of a new generation of packaging papers characterized for being more recyclable, less hygroscopic, stiff and durable. The high recycling rate of papers in Europe (which is at the level of 72%) and the consequent importance that recycling has for the circular economy, were at the basis of this study. Paper products form part of an integrated carbon cycle based on the photosynthetic conversion of water, carbon dioxide, nutrients and solar energy into renewable wood-based biomass. Once consumed, paper may be recovered and used again either as a source of secondary fibres, to produce recycled paper or as bio-fuel. Fibre packages or corrugated containers made from corrugated board were the ones that were dealt with in the project, as they are considered as being the most prominent structural application of paper. Chemical modification attempts Fibre modification with chemicals or enzymes had been investigated in the production of fibreboards.Gomez-Bueso et al. 2000M√ºller et al. 2009 Fibre modification applying steam (steam-exploded wood) has been proved an efficient pre-treatment method in producing thermoplastic composites. Current theories for interfibre bonding during papermaking process are based on general recognition of the hydrogen bonding model. Consequently, all effort for boosting fibre strength is connected to mechanical beating of fibres in order to generate more flexible and fragmented fibres for increased bonding areas. As a consequence, significant drawbacks are obtained in terms of water retention ratio resulting in poor dewatering behaviour and high energy consumption. New mechanisms for interpretation and control of interfibre bonding are still upcoming. One way to overcome these drawbacks could be the molecular coating of cellulose fibres using polymers targeted on entropy controlled mixing of polymers and cellulose gel resulting in higher bonding forces. Theoretical results as well as experimental data on how application of polymeric layers (e.g. carboxymethyl cellulose) and enzymes on cellulose fibres can lead to sheets of high bonding strength without any mechanical beating have been already presented.Laine at al. 2002, Gustavsson 2003, Danielsson 2006, Erhard 2010. However, these attempts were still far from any industrial implementation and their application would have been costly and would not solve the problem of raw material availability. Objective Based on this state-of-the-art, the objective of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated board manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner. In the case of packaging, scientific technical knowledge of practical industrial relations between fibre characteristics, paper properties and corrugated board properties also is needed. From wood fibre modification to paper technology chemical wood modification aims at altering the structure of the cell wall matrix. Wood properties are improved considerably by converting hydrophilic OH-groups into larger more hydrophobic groups. Also the physical fixation of modifying chemicals in the cell wall matrix can considerably change the wood properties. In addition to a hydrophobing effect, the treatments reduce the volume of cell wall nano-pores and thus decrease the incorporation of water molecules into the cell wall matrix. On a macroscopic scale, wood modification can change important properties of the wood including biological durability (resistance against fungi), dimensional stability, hardness and UV-stability. Since paper is produced from wood fibres, it was possible to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, polyelectrolytes, functional polymers based on cellulose, hemicelluloses and starch) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and University of G√∂ttingen, Germany; Kungliga Tekniska h√∂gskolan (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on chemical fibre modification of recycled fibres. Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified recycled fibres with N-methylol compounds and glutaraldehyde with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance.Adamopoulos and Mai (2011). Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified recycled fibres were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones.Adamopoulos et al. 2011 The intention of the Fibre+ project is to build on the existing knowledge on fibre modification for adapting, implementing and disseminating this innovative technology in European paper SMEs. Results of the Fibre+ project on recycled fibres for packaging paper and information on potential developments of the Fibre+ concept can be found on the Fibre+ website including scientific articles that have been published as a consequence of the RTD work that has been carried out during the project.

Zion) Church and a professor of ministry with research interests in Practical Theology, Congregational Studies and Leadership, Ethnography, Evangelism and Church Planting, Black Church Studies, and Urban Church Ministry. Academics and professionals in these fields consider him a renowned thought leader. Tribble's experience in pastoral ministry allows for his work to bridge the gap between academic research and practical church leadership. Career Tribble received a B.S. from Howard University (1981), a Black Minister's Program Certificate from Hartford Seminary (1985), a M.Div. from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary (1990), and a Ph.D. from Northwestern University (2002). He began his work in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church as a minister of membership development at Martin Temple A.M.E. Zion Church in Chicago, Illinois (1990‚Äì1991). Tribble was ordained as an elder in 1992, when he then served as the pastor at St. Andrew A.M.E. Zion Church in Gary, Indiana (1991‚Äì1997). He has also served in the A.M.E. Zion Church as a pastor at St. Mark church in Chicago, Illinois (1997‚Äì2000), co-pastor at New vision Church in Suwanee, Georgia (2007‚Äì2008), Associate pastor at Greater Walters church in Chicago, Illinois (2006‚Äì2007), the minister of evangelism and men's ministry and founding Dean of the Life Development Institute at Martin Temple Church in Chicago, Illinois (2000‚Äì2006), and as the presiding elder for the A.M.E. Zion Church for the Augusta District (2008‚Äì2013) and the Atlanta District (2013‚Äìpresent). He began his career as an academic at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary where he served as adjunct faculty (1999‚Äì2000, 2008 and 2009), Instructor of Congregational Ministries and Director of Teaching Parishes and Congregational Research (July 2000 ‚Äì June 2003) and Assistant Professor of Congregational Leadership and Director of the Center for the Church and the Black Experience (July 2003 ‚Äì June 2007). He has been a lecturer at Apex School of Theology in Durham, NC (2009). He joined the faculty of Columbia Theological Seminary as Assistant Professor of Ministry (2007‚Äì2012). He currently still serves at Columbia Theological Seminary where he is now the Associate Professor of Ministry. He is also Presiding Elder for the Atlanta District, Georgia Annual Conference and Candidate for Bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church for 2016. Thought Tribble is a strong proponent of the transformative leadership idea. He has written extensively about how leaders, especially those who work in the church, should be open to transformation themselves as they transform the community they are leading. He writes about this specifically from the perspective of the Black Church in two of his books, Transformative Pastoral Leadership in the Black Church and Joining Jesus: A Class Manual for initiation into Christian Discipleship and Welcome into the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. From this point of view he emphasizes his research on how the Black Church \\"must continue its historic mission of being an instrument of survival, elevation, and liberation for its people.\\" He however does not limit his research just to the Black Church, he pushes for transformative leadership between various religious traditions as well. He has published numerous books, articles, and chapters that are used in this context by people and institutions across the world and across denominational lines.

She served as a faculty member of Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology and Department of Neurobiology and Behavior and taught graduate students while conducting research until retiring as of October 2010. She currently resides in Ithaca, New York, with her husband, Jack Bradbury.  Education  She graduated from Crescenta Valley High School in La Crescenta, California, in 1965. She went on to receive her bachelors in Zoology with honors from the University of California at Berkeley in 1970, and her Ph.D in Animal Behavior from Cornell University in 1976. After her extensive education, she started her career in research.  Personal and early life  Vehrencamp grew up in La Crescenta, California, and attended Crescenta Valley High School. During the time period Sandra Vehrencamp was born, women's scientific talents were substantially under-appreciated. She received her high-school diploma in 1965 and went on to pursue a higher education from there. However, before 1950, women earned less than 10% of Bachelor's in the STEM fields and less than 5% of the PhDs in these fields. She grew up with this stigma surrounding her and still managed to attend the University of California at Berkeley for her bachelors and Cornell University for her doctorate. The percentages of women receiving bachelors and PhDs were steadily rising throughout her young life, although the year she graduated from Cornell University still less than 10% of doctorates were received by women. Scientific women of the time were quite rare, and this fact highlights her dedication and passion for science, as is noted by other scientists. While in the midst of her education at Cornell University, she met her spouse-to-be, Jack Bradbury. They had their first child in 1975, just a year before Vehrencamp received her PhD and started her career. Their second child was born in 1979, when Vehrencamp was just beginning to settle into a career path. These few starting years were hectic for Vehrencamp, and it has been noted how impressive it is that she managed to keep furthering her career the way she did. Her older daughter, Kristin Nobel, is currently married and has two kids, her family living in Maine. Her younger daughter, Katrina Bradbury, studied ethnobotany but died in 2015.  Career  Since 1976 she worked with University of California at San Diego and Cornell University conducting intensive research about birds and their behavior, specifically song patterns and mating habits. She taught animal communication research methods in animal behavior to graduate students during her time at Cornell University, and currently holds a professor emerita position there. Vehrencamp is said to have been an outstanding mentor, teacher, and scientist by her graduate students. Additionally, she worked with the Laboratory of Ornithology Bioacoustics Research Program and contributed to the bird call section, specifically that of Costa Rican wrens; she still holds an emerita professor appointment there as well. Throughout her career she published over 75 papers, which have been cited more than 2,400 times, and wrote 19 book chapters. She collaborated with her husband, Jack Bradbury - a behavioral ecologist as well - consistently during her time as a scientist. They co-wrote a textbook, Principles of Animal Communication, published in 1998. It is a widely used work that combines physics, chemistry, neurobiology, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, and economics to delve deeply into animals and how they signal and communicate with one another. Its importance is highlighted by the fact that it has been cited more than 1,000 times. This textbook is highly regarded in the scientific community and is revered as the standard reference of the animal behavior world.  Notable research ventures  * Veherncamp quantified the energetic cost of display in sage grouse. This study employed doubly labeled water to measure oxygen consumption for a period of about a week while observing the lek attendance and display rate of each male. The key findings were that 1) male display activity varied enormously, from zero to daily attendance with high display rate, 2) only the most active males achieved matings, and 3) more active males traveled further away from the lek each day to forage. The paper was touted as one of the first to test honest signaling theory using energetics. * Vehrencamp studied the communal nesting behavior of the Groove-billed Ani in Costa Rica, and the conflict that occurs among the co-breeding pairs despite their overall cooperation. The egg-tossing behavior, which leads to a general advantage for the last-laying female, was a surprising finding at the time. In another study aimed at identifying the advantage to group as opposed to solitary pair breeding, she found that groups of two pairs had the highest fitness, benefitting from higher adult survival in groups while avoiding the excessive nestling competition and losses found in groups of 3 or more pairs. Based on these studies, Vehrencamp synthesized an optimization model that defined conditions under which group-living and cooperating individuals interact in a despotic versus and egalitarian manner. * Vehrencamp's songbird communication work focused on species with male song repertoires and investigated why such repertoires should evolve and how they are used in communication. Her research group found that in both song sparrows and the banded wren, males shared some fraction of their song types with each of their neighbors, and strategically used song-type matching and switching between song types to signal different levels of aggressive escalation. The song sparrow study was among the first to employ interactive playback techniques to test the signaling function of song type matching, overlapping, and different switching patterns, as well as the significance of trill structure. Vehrencamp spent decades of her life studying behavioral ecology, and retired fully accomplished in 2010. Her detailed work earned several awards soon after.  Awards  * In 2004 she received the Faculty Research Mentor Award from Cornell University for her outstanding performance conducting research while mentoring graduate students on bird song in Costa Rica. * She won the William Brewster Memorial Award in 2011 for her discoveries surrounding the reproductive ecology and competition of groove-billed anis and sage-grouse. This award is presented to an author or coauthors of an exceptional body of work on the birds of the Western Hemisphere. The American Ornithologists‚Äô Union stated that they, ‚Äúhonored Dr. Sandra Vehrencamp for her thorough and insightful body of work on social evolution and animal communication‚Äù. The award means significantly more when the fact that the overwhelming majority of recipients have been male is considered: out of 83 years, only 7 recipients have been female. * Vehrencamp and her husband co-received the Exemplar Award from the Animal Behavior Society, recognizing a ‚Äúmajor long-term contribution in animal behavior,‚Äù in 2012. This is the second most prestigious award given out by the ABS, and Vehrencamp's success is highlighted by the fact that the organization has been giving out exemplar awards since 1993 but only 4 out of 18 awards have been presented to women contributors. * She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as a fellow in the Biological Sciences in 2013, recognized as ‚Äúa founder of the field of behavioral ecology.‚Äù It is well known in the scientific community that being appointed a fellow in this organization is considered a great honor.

It has similar flowers and fruits and grows in similar environments to Myoporum tetrandrum but differs from it and all other members of the genus by having hairs on the outer edge of the petals. Description Myoporum velutinum is a shrub which sometimes grows to a height of and which has hairs on the stem and leaves but lacks the warty surface of many other myoporums. The leaves are arranged alternately and are lance shaped, usually long, wide, soft, covered with soft hairs, darker green on the upper surface and have a prominent mid-vein. The flowers are borne in leaf axils, usually in groups of 1 to 5 on stalks long. There are 5 triangular, pointed sepals and 5 petals forming a bell-shaped tube. The petals are white or pale lilac, sometimes spotted inside the tube and on the base of the lobes. The tube is long and the lobes are about the same length. The tube is hairy on its inner and outer surfaces and there are 4 stamens which extend slightly beyond the petal tube. The fruit that follows flowering is an oval-shaped drupe, about . Taxonomy and naming Myoporum velutinum was first formally described by taxonomist Bob Chinnock in Eremophila and allied genera: a monograph of the plant family Myoporaceae in 2007 from a specimen collected near Condingup. The specific epithet (velutinum) is a Latin word meaning \\"velvety\\", referring to the indumentum of the leaves\\". Distribution and habitat Myoporum velutinum occurs in a small area near Cape Le Grand where it grows along creeks in Melaleuca woodland. Conservation Myoporum velutinum has been classified as \\" Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is \\"likely to become extinct or is rare, or otherwise in need of special protection\\".

She has spent most of her career at CERN, where she today has the status of honorary member of the personnel. Maria received her degrees in Physics from the University of Rome in the 1940s. In 1954, she obtained a fellowship from the International Federation of University Women to do research at the University of Liverpool. In July 1955, she married Giuseppe Fidecaro, a fellow physicist. In 1956, Maria obtained the CERN fellowship. She is among the pioneering scientists at CERN since the establishment of the institution in 1954.  Scientific research  After Maria‚Äôs marriage, she and Giuseppe carried out experiments on pions. Maria worked with a diffusion chamber and Giuseppe with a lead glass Cherenkov counter. Maria and Giuseppe were also involved in cosmic rays experiment in the Italian Alps just after the war. The experiment was set at 3,500 meters on the face of Matterhorn, using a detector of 1-square meter. After Maria and Giuseppe moved to Geneva, Giuseppe was assigned to the Synchrocyclotron Division. The Synchrocyclotron was the first accelerator to be built at CERN in 1957. Meanwhile, Maria worked on a novel method to provide polarized proton beams to be used for particle collision in the accelerator. Throughout her career as an experimental physicist, she co-signed close to 200 publications. The majority of her research relates directly to the experiments, including interpreting the measurements and results in the search for new particles. In Maria‚Äôs early works in the 1960s, she studied the nucleon-nucleon charge exchange scattering, recorded data on high-energy electrodynamic processes. Her research work also tackled the phenomenon of proton-proton elastic scattering. In the 1990s, she investigated the design and test of a prototype gas-sampling electromagnetic calorimeter of high granularity and collaborated on the construction of a position-sensitive photon detector for CPLEAR experiment. CPLEAR experiment aims to carry out precision measurements of CP, T and CPT violation of the neutral kaon systems. Maria‚Äôs other work focused on phenomenological aspects of particle physics. She studied the fundamental symmetries in the neutral kaon systems. By the measurements of interactions and decays of neutral kaons, new and detailed information was found on CPT invariance in time evolution and decay. The newly achieved level of precision of the experiments called into question the validity of some of the often tacitly assumed hypotheses in particle physics. Maria was also involved in the search for CP-violation (charge-parity violation) in the NA48 experiment. After the theory of CP-violation in the decay of neutral kaon system was experimentally confirmed, the discovery brought the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1980 to the discoverers of the theories, James Cronin, and Val Fitch. The discovery played an important role in helping scientists explain the dominance of matter over antimatter.  Personal life  Maria and Giuseppe Fidecaro were the first few scientists among a total of 300 to 400 staff when CERN was first founded. During their time, few people could do experiments at CERN. Maria started with a group of only three scientists. The couple, having devoted 60 years to research at CERN since its beginning, is seen as a living memory of the institute.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1985 until October 1986 she won four of her nine races. As a two-year-old she finished second on her debut and won two minor races before recording an upset victory over a strong field for the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she finished fifth in the 1000 Guineas and second in the Coronation Stakes before ending her career with a win in the Petition Stakes. Her broodmare career was largely undistinguished but she produced one excellent racehorse in Zenno El Cid, a major winner in Japan. Background Embla was a \\"strong, rangy\\" dark bay mare with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by Cleaboy Farms. She was sired by Dominion who finished third in the 1975 2000 Guineas and won the Prix Perth in 1976. before being exported to North America and winning the Bernard Baruch Handicap in 1978. He sired several good horses over a wide range of distances including First Island, the sprinter Primo Dominie (Coventry Stakes), and the stayer Trainglot (Cesarewitch Handicap). Embla's dam Kaftan won one minor race from four attempts but was a half-sister to the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Blue Cashmere and a granddaughter of the Yorkshire Oaks runner-up No Saint, whose other descendants included Persian Heights. As a yearling Embla was offered for sale and bought for 46,000 guineas by representatives of Charles St George. The filly was sent into training with Luca Cumani at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1985: two-year-old season Embla began her racing career by finishing second in a minor race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in late June. She then started favourite for an eighteen-runner maiden race at Kempton Park Racecourse in July and won easily. On her next appearance she was less impressive as she started 1/5 favourite for a minor event at Ripon Racecourse in August but won by only three-quarters of a length from Raisinhell. Timeform described her as \\"scrambling home\\" in the race. Cumani, nevertheless, held the filly in high regard and later explained that she had been going through an \\"awkward growing phase\\" at the time. On her final appearance of the year, Embla was moved up sharply in class to contest the Cheveley Park Stakes (the only Group One race in Britain at the time restricted to juvenile fillies) over six furlongs at Newmarket in October. The leading American jockey Angel Cordero was booked for the ride, but the filly was given little chance and started a 20/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field. The Jeremy Tree-trained Kingcote started favourite after a four-length win in the Lowther Stakes, whilst the other contenders included Park Express, Storm Star (winner of the Cherry Hinton Stakes), Asteroid Field (Waterford Candelabra Stakes), Bambolona (Sirenia Stakes), Wanton (third in the Flying Childers Stakes), Nashia (runner-up in the Prix d'Arenberg) and Rose of the Sea (fourth in the Prix Morny). In the early stages Rose of the Sea led from Storm Star, with Embla towards the rear and apparently struggling to match the pace. Kingscote went to the front approaching the final furlong but Embla was making relentless progress and soon moved into contention. She overtook Kingscote a hundred yards from the finish and won by a length. Rose of the Sea held on for third ahead of Asteroid Field. 1986: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut Embla contested the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 15 April and finished fourth of the nine runners behind Sonic Lady. Sixteen days later she started 6/1 second favourite behind Sonic Lady in the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Tony Ives she finished fifth behind Midway Lady, Maysoon, Sonic Lady and Ala Mahlik. She proved no match for Sonic Lady in her next two races, finishing second in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and fifth in the Child Stakes at Newmarket on 9 July. After a break of three months the filly returned and was dropped in class for the Petition Stakes over one mile at Newmarket in October. She recorded her only success of the year as she narrowly defeated the colt Santella Mac. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1985, Embla was rated the third-best two-year-old filly in Europe after the French-trained Baiser Vole and Regal State. The independent Timeform organisation rated her on 121, three pounds behind their top juvenile filly Femme Elite. She was rated 110 by Timeform in 1986. Breeding record Embla was retired from racing to become a broodmare and produced eleven foals between 1988 and 2003. Three of her offspring won races, with the most successful, by far, being the Japanese horse Zenno El Cid. *Nordic Myth, a bay filly, foaled in 1988, sired by Shareef Dancer.

The main span is (two spans) and the bridge has a total length of . It is named after U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who was born in Kentucky and grew up in Southern Indiana. History The Abraham Lincoln Bridge opened on December 6, 2015, and is parallel to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge upstream and carries six lanes of northbound I-65 traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle lanes were in the original plans, but have since been removed. The existing I-65 John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, completed in 1963, is being renovated for six lanes of southbound traffic. On October 10, 2016, five lanes of the Kennedy Bridge reopened, at which time the Lincoln Bridge began carrying only northbound traffic after several months of carrying three lanes of traffic in both directions. Both spans opened, with six lanes of traffic in each direction, in December 2016. Tolling on both spans began on December 30, 2016. A Structured Public Involvement protocol developed by Drs. K. Bailey and T. Grossardt was used to elicit public preferences for the design of the structure. From spring 2005 to summer 2006 several hundred citizens attended a series of public meetings in Louisville, Kentucky and Jeffersonville, Indiana and evaluated a range of bridge design options using 3D visualizations. This public involvement process focused in on designs that the public felt were more suitable, as shown by their polling scores. The SPI public involvement process itself was evaluated by anonymous, real-time citizen polling at the open public meetings. On July 19, 2006, the final design alternatives for the bridge were announced. The three designs included a three-span arch, a cable-stayed design with three towers, and a cable-stayed type with a single A-shaped support tower. It was also announced that the projected cost for the bridge would be $203 million. The structure is an additional bridge in downtown Louisville joining the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge erected between spring 1961 and late 1963 at a cost of $10 million ($77.5 million in 2015 dollars); the four-lane George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge, constructed from June 1928 and to October 31, 1929, and the Big Four Bridge, which operated as a railroad bridge from 1895 to 1969 and reopened as a pedestrian bridge in May 2014. Some critics say that the Abraham Lincoln Bridge is not being used enough to warrant its cost of construction. The bridge, originally built to ease congestion, is proving to be unused by commuters who do not want to pay the toll. Among the original planners for bridge funding were some who resisted using tolls and the electronic transponder technique of payment without actual toll booths.

After completing her residency in internal medicine, she received her clinical fellowship training in infectious diseases at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and her post-doctoral training in molecular immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York. During the early 1980s, while working as a medical resident in Charleston, South Carolina, McElrath became inspired to research HIV/AIDS after caring for many young patients who were dying from a mysterious illness that, ultimately, was identified as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS. This desire even became more urgent as she focused on infectious diseases in New York City. In 1988, she was named an assistant professor at the Rockefeller University. In 1990, McElrath relocated to Seattle to take a position at the University of Washington as an assistant professor and to direct the HIV AIDS Madison Clinic at Harborview Medical Center. Within two years, she shifted her focus back to the bench to pursue the path to an HIV vaccine and became the director of the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Unit at the University of Washington. McElrath traveled to South Africa in 2000 and, while driving through villages in the coastal areas near Durban, she saw the tangible toll of the AIDS epidemic. Elderly women in Durban were cradling crying babies and teenagers were tending to toddlers ‚Äì the orphaned survivors of a decimated generation, she recalled in an interview. At the same time, a large percentage of people in the region also were known to be infected with HIV. She later described the situation as \\"terribly sobering.\\" In 1996, McElrath joined the faculty at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, bringing her work toward an HIV vaccine to the center. She was honored for her research with an NIH Merit Award and served as associate editor of the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Over time, she became a full professor at the University of Washington a full member at Fred Hutch, and the director of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HTVN) Laboratory Center. Headquartered at Fred Hutch, HVTN is the world's largest network dedicated to testing vaccines designed to prevent HIV. The finding launched a push to better understand how the trial vaccines prevented HIV and how they could be improved. That initiative became a major focus of the HVTN's lab program, headed by McElrath. The Thai trial led McElrath, her colleagues and collaborators at Duke University and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine to make a pivotal discovery. For the first time, they pinpointed \\"immune correlates\\" that were associated with reduced HIV risk. One of their key findings suggested the vaccines might spur some recipients to make antibodies that prevent HIV infection. McElrath‚Äôs quest to develop an HIV vaccine spurred her effort to launch a new immunology lab Cape Town, South Africa. That facility opened its doors in 2013. In addition to her work with HVTN and at Fred Hutch, McElrath is an attending physician at Harborview Medical Center, the University of Washington Medical Center and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the treatment arm of Fred Hutch. She has published nearly 300 papers in peer-reviewed journals, the majority on HIV/AIDS. In 2007, she co-founded the Vaccine Infectious Disease Institute at Fred Hutch and has served as sole director of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutch since 2011. Research McElrath‚Äôs scientific interests include investigations to understand the human immune responses that control and prevent HIV-1 infection by using multi-disciplinary and cross- platform approaches. She continues to be involved in a global initiative to develop an HIV-1 vaccine, and in research to identify innate and mucosal immune defenses generated following vaccination. McElrath has taken a leadership role or has been a significant contributor to numerous integrated programs at the national and international level to advance a coordinated effort to curb the HIV epidemic through prevention efforts. Those include: the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, the Gates Foundation Innate Immunity Consortium (PI), the Microbicide Trials Network (Director, Immunology Core), and the Seattle Vaccine Trials Unit (PI). At the McElrath Laboratory at Fred Hutch, a primary goal is to determine how T cell memory is induced both in natural infection and by immunization. McElrath and her team also are working to identify the properties of T cells that confer containment or eradiation of HIV-1. Their studies span a wide array of immunologic investigations in persons who experience unusual control of HIV-1 infection, including individuals with newly diagnosed infection, those with long-term non- progressive disease who control infection for more than a decade without antiretroviral treatment, and people repeatedly exposed but not infected. These clinical cohorts have been assembled for longitudinal studies in both Seattle and in two nations where the HIV epidemic is widespread ‚Äì South Africa and Uganda. On Dec. 1, 2015 the work of McElrath and HTVN scientists pursuing a vaccine to potentially halt HIV and AIDS will be highlighted in an HBO/VICE special report titled \\"Countdown to Zero.\\" Honors McElrath is a member of the Association of American Physicians, American College of Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. She is a past recipient of the Burroughs Wellcome Clinical Scientist Award in Translational Research, a National Institutes of Health Merit Award, and the GAIA Vaccine Foundation Award. She serves on numerous scientific advisory committees and boards for institutions, government and industry.

Webster is a locality in Alberta, Canada that was established in 1916 as a station on the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway, about 30 km north of the city of Grande Prairie. It was named after George Webster, a subcontractor for the railway at that time. Although there were a few railway workers who lived in the area from 1916 to the late 1920s, the town was properly settled in 1929 by Polish immigrants from the Vermilion area who had fled Poland after Russia invaded following World War I. In the fall of 1929, a store was opened by Andrew and Cathy Hancharyk, and a post office opened on October 15, 1929, with Andrew Hancharyk as postmaster. Across the street from the store was a butcher shop and caf√©. The community included two livery barns, a single elevator which served an area as far away as Heart Valley, an elevator house, and a water tank for trains. Across the creek was the Webster sawmill. In 1930, a large Catholic church was erected, which also served as a schoolroom for the Torun School District for several years. In the late 1930s, Webster Hall was built for community gatherings, and a rectory was added for the first resident Catholic priest. In later years, the elevator was destroyed by fire, followed by the church in the early 1960s. In 1957, Torun School closed, and the students were vanned to Sexsmith. The post office closed in 1966, leaving only the hall and the Catholic grotto which had been erected beside the church, as well as the Webster Cemetery.

There are many fruits that can be used in this process; the most popular one that artists use are watermelons, apples, strawberries, pineapples, and cantaloupes. History  China  Many believe that fruit carving originated in China during the Tang Dynasty, which lasted from AD 618-906. Fruit carving in China usually features legendary creatures, and animals. Not only is fruit carving used in cultural and traditional ceremonies, but also ordinary households are known for decorating plates with fruit carvings when they have guests over. Specifically, watermelon carving has been and still is very popular in China. Usually, the outside of the melon is carved on and the melon pulp is scraped out of the inside of the melon, so it can be used as a container to put food or flowers in. Chinese fruit carving is used to tell their legends and stories. Europe Fruit carving is included in Matthias Giegher's 1621 work Il Trinciante (\\"The Carver\\"), where he describes carving oranges and citrons into abstract patterns, shell-fish, four-legged animals and the Habsburgs' double- headed eagle, but the art was not common in Europe or North America until the 1980s when several books on the topic were published.  Thailand  A platter of Thai fruit carvings Fruit carving is a significant part of Thai cultural heritage. Watermelon carving dates to the 14th century in Thailand during the Sukhothai dynasty. The annual Loi Krathong Festival occurs each November where people in Thailand float lamps and lanterns down a river to honor water spirits. One legend is that one of the king‚Äôs maids decorated her lantern with a watermelon carved with flower designs to impress him and that he was so pleased that he encouraged all Thai women to adopt the practice. The king also requested that fruit carving become part of the primary school curriculum. Thailand fruit carving features flowers, birds and floral patterns. Japan The Japanese emphasize the presentation of a dish and how the plate aesthetically appeals to others. Fruit carving in Japan is referred to as Mukimono. Mukimono began in ancient Japan in an effort to make dishes more appealing since the food was placed and served on an unglazed pottery plate, which had a rough look to it. Chefs would cover the plate in leaves and would fold them into different designs in order to make the dish look better. This technique eventually turned into carving fruit that would also be placed on the plates to enhance the appearance of the dish. At first, when this technique came out, vendors on the streets would add carved fruit to their food when customers made a special request, but now it is very common for all Japanese dishes to feature carved fruits. Fruit carving and garnishing is now a significant part of Japanese chef training. Overview A fruit carving on a watermelon in Armenia The art of fruit carving uses many different tools, usually ordinary items but some specific to just fruit carving. All these tools give the artwork a different texture or help with its design. Some of the tools include: * Pen: to draw on the carving one wishes to make * Carving Knife: most commonly used for giving the carving shape * Peel Zester: this tool is used to create strips and grooves * Melon Baller: can be used for a variety of fruit to add ball shaped fruit carvings to the display * U shaped garnish tool: used to cut the outer layer of the fruit. This tool is used for fine detailed work. Many fruit carvers use this tool to create a pedals for a flower shape they are carving. * V shaped formed cutter: is used in a similar way as the U shaped garnish tool but for larger carving ideas. Before carving a fruit, the necessary materials must be gathered. The usual process is to have the tools handy for when they are needed in one's steps towards creating a carving. There are two types of carvings that can be done. The first is Skin Carving, this is when the outer skin of the fruit (or vegetable) is carved to reveal the fleshy center, where the color is different than the outer skin to create a design using the contrast between the outer skin and flesh of the fruit. The second type of carving is Three Dimensional Carving, the purpose of this particular technique of carving is to carve the fruit into a three dimensional object of the carver‚Äôs choice. The most popular three dimensional design is floral objects. It is easy to over-carve a fruit which leads to loss in nutrition, but it is always important to start off by outlining your carving on the fruit. Depending on the design that is being created it may take very little time or be more complex and use more time and concentration also different steps in the process are used for each design. Not one design is alike. An important aspect of fruit carving is that the fruit you carve must be suitable for the manner which one will display it. Most fruit carvings will need to be refrigerated before they are placed in the specific setting that is desired. Artists There are many artists and chefs who are known for their fruit carving skills. Each has a different technique. Many of these chefs have previously owned restaurants and now hold classes in this art. Valeriano Fatica is an Italian fruit carver, known through his videos on YouTube that has attracted people to his artwork around the world. He has carved many different fruits at a large scale. Jimmy Zhang is a fruit carver from China. He has won many awards in the culinary area and has also been featured in many newspapers across the globe for his skills. He teaches classes on how to carve fruit and vegetables and master the skills and learn history about the way China has created its fruit carving industry. Carl Franklin Jones, an expert in the art of fruit carving, practices in the United States. He is known for his fruit carving sculpture that was created for Ivanka Trump's wedding. He also holds a catering businesses in Tennessee. Jones was a business owner of many franchises also in Tennessee before starting his catering business. Today Jones travels the world and hosts mentoring programs for young ambitious fruit carving artists and chefs.  Fruit carving today  Some people perform fruit carving professionally. Some chefs utilize fruit carving as a culinary technique. Once fruit carvers have mastered the techniques past the intermediate stage and become professionals, they can price their services to restaurants, professional caterers, hotels and resorts. Professional fruit carvers can also create centerpieces and displays for various events, such as parties and wedding receptions. On a smaller scale, fruit carvers can present a dish with decorative garnishing to add an aesthetically pleasing experience to their viewers.

It was built in the Baroque style between 1726 and 1728, to designs of the French architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion. The building is linked to Palazzo Vilhena, but it has its own entrance and fa√ßade. History The Corte Capitanale was built between 1726 and 1728 along with the rest of Palazzo Vilhena, the Grand Master's official residence in Mdina. The building was mainly a courthouse, but it also served as the seat of the Capitano della Verga. Stairway with the doors of the courtrooms Its linking to the palace was a symbolic gesture to convey the fact that the courts were under the jurisdiction of the Order of St. John. The courthouse was also linked to the Bishop's Palace through a now-blocked underground passage, indicating the Church's role in the courts. During the French occupation of Malta, a Maltese doctor was accused of spying for the French by the Maltese insurgents. Despite not being found guilty by the court, the Maltese requested for him to be given a death sentence. Though the judge refused their demand, the Maltese assassinated him as soon as he exited the building.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/41629/1/Tobba_Maltin_matul_iz- zminijiet_1989.pdf In 1813 Civil Commissioner Alexander Ball terminated and transferred the judicial power of the Corte Capitanale of Mdina to the Castellania in Valletta. Today, the Corte Capitanale is Mdina's city hall, being the seat of the city's local council. The council considers the building as inadequate, and in 2012 it requested to move its premises to the Banca Giuratale. It is not regularly open to the public, but the main hall is occasionally open with temporary historical or cultural exhibitions. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument and it is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture Herald's Loggia The Corte Capitanale is built in the French Baroque style. The fa√ßade is decorated by superimposed Tuscan and Corinthian pilasters, and a cornice along roof level. A balcony is located above the main doorway, and it is decorated with allegorical statues of Justice and Mercy. The inscription Legibus et Armis (by using laws and arms) is inscribed below the centrepiece of the fa√ßade. The courthouse incorporates some prison cells and dungeons, which had been built in the 16th century. The building is also linked to a loggia known as Herald's Loggia, from which town criers used to announce decrees to the people. The loggia also predates the courthouse, and it is believed to date to the 17th century.

The new party held rallies to pressurise the British to extend the self-government plans to Burma. A proposal known as the Craddock Plan to give ethnic minorities separate representation was opposed by the GCBA, which saw it as an attempt at divide and rule. In 1922 the British agreed to extend the Indian system to Burma, and elections were scheduled for November. However, this caused a split in the GCBA, with the majority calling for a boycott and others calling for participation in the elections. This eventually led to 21 dissidents leaving to form the 21 Party, which emerged as the largest faction in the Legislative Council following the elections.Fukui, pp150‚àí151 The GCBA split again in the build-up to the 1925 elections due to differences over another boycott, as well as the organisation's finances and the role of monks. Dissidents left to form the U Chit Hlaing Faction, which subsequently splintered into the Home Rule Party and the Hlaing-Myat-Paw GCBA. The rump of the GCBA became known as the Soe Thein GCBA, named after its leader U Soe Thein. Another split occurred in 1929 when the organisation was split into the Ye-U group led by U Su and the Thetpan Sayadaws led by U Soe Thein. The latter collapsed in the early 1930s and many of its members joined other parties to contest elections. By 1932 the GCBA was effectively defunct, although its name continued to be used by some parties, including the United GCBA established in 1936.

Biography Originally a monk at the Monastery of Qartmin, Athanasius became Bishop of Maiperqat, a bishopric subordinate to the Metropolitan Bishop of Amid. During his tenure as bishop, Athanasius is known to have used church funds to obtain the support of the Caliph Marwan II to strengthen his position. By 742/743, Athanasius had been granted the title of Metropolitan of Mesopotamia, potentially due to the simultaneous growth and decline of Maiperqat and Amid respectively, as well as the decrepitude of Severus, Bishop of Amid.Palmer (1990), pp. 169-172 As metropolitan, Athanasius granted his student Isaiah of Ashparin administrative control of the greater part of the diocese of Amid as a result of Severus' inability to lead the diocese. During the late 740s, however, this appointment caused Athanasius to come into conflict with the patriarch Iwannis I who ordained a certain Abay, former Bishop of Arzun, as the new bishop of Amid. This conflict was exacerbated by Iwannis' failure to ordain Dionysius, Athanasius' appointment to the empty see of Tur Abdin, after the death of its former incumbent Athanasius of Nunib. At the Synod of Tella in 752, Athanasius expanded his authority as metropolitan from the area of the former Roman province of Mesopotamia to the entirety of Upper Mesopotamia through the use of implicit threats of reprisals from the Muslim authorities, despite the protests of the bishops. Athanasius commemorated his success with the erection of a new cathedral in the city of Maiperqat. He later used his new authority to ordain his student Iwannis Isaac as Bishop of Harran and depose the bishops of Samosata and Singara. Athanasius also succeeded in having Iwannis Isaac ordained as the patriarch and successor to Iwannis I in 754. Daniel, son of Moses of Tur Abdin, later claimed that Athanasius secured Iwannis' elevation to the patriarchal office by organising the election fraudulently. Athanasius succeeded Iwannis in 756 and served as patriarch until 758.

Bunge was born in a time where women were still in separate spheres from men and limited by society to domestic life. She challenged these expectations set by society and followed her passion for science, becoming an inspirational role model for women today.  Early life  Mary Bartlett was born on April 3, 1931 in New Haven, Connecticut to George Chapman Bartlett and Margaret Elizabeth Reynolds Bartlett. Her father built and renovated houses, including the house in which she grew up, whereas her mother worked as a painter and decorator. Neither of her parents had a college education, and her father thought that a college education was useless for women. Their careers were filled with an artistic expression that Mary found appealing. After her grandmother taught her how to sew, she expressed herself through art and fashion by designing and making all of her own clothes with the ultimate dream to be a fashion designer in New York City. She strongly considered this career in fashion design, but eventually decided her art interests could just be hobbies. She was also interested in the sciences from a very young age, even though it was not considered a traditional option for women at the time. She developed this passion for biology when she was exploring the stream near her home in her leaky little row boat. She observed the tadpoles swimming around her and questioned how they developed into frogs. Unlike her art interests, she knew that in order to pursue her childhood passion for biology, she would need to acquire a higher education.  Education  Mary Bartlett made the first step towards this higher education when she attended Simmons College in Boston to become a laboratory technician. This defied expectations for women at the time as the 1950s female college student was encouraged to marry, start a family, and put an end to her education. Only about a third of the women who entered college during the decade actually graduated. Only ten percent of working women entered a profession during this time. They instead settled for the traditional employment in secretarial, clerical, nursing, teaching, assembly lines, and domestic service, which were considered appropriate for women. Despite these statistics, Mary persevered, and at the end of her junior year at Simmons College, she was inspired to further her education while attending a program at Jackson Memorial Laboratory, where she witnessed a rabbit's heart contract in a tissue culture. This instance triggered the realization that she did not want to be a lab tech; she wanted to do research, so when she graduated from Simmons College in 1953, she accepted the invitation to graduate school at University of Wisconsin Medical School from Dr. Robert Schilling. He was a professor in the Department of Medical Physiology who offered Mary a research assistantship position when she was studying to obtain her master's degree. They researched intrinsic factor, which is lacking from the gastric juices when one has the condition of pernicious anemia and cannot absorb vitamin B12. Their research had a clinical relevance that influenced her later research to be focused toward clinical applications. This work was the basis of her thesis, which allowed her to graduate with her master's degree in medical physiology in 1955. There was implicit bias in society that women were not competent enough to excel in the science profession, so they were not always taken seriously when trying to attain this goal. Mary noted that Dr. Schilling was an exception to this and was an outstanding mentor to her. He helped set the high standards for her manuscripts when she was initially getting published. Women at the time struggled to get their work published because of the gender discrimination. When the author listed was a female name, people tended to reject the paper or not even read it, so women had to use their initials. Then, the author could not be labeled male or female, and the women had a better chance for equal evaluation of the work. While studying for her doctorate at University of Wisconsin Medical School, Mary worked in the Zoology Department with Dr. Hans Ris, who she also regarded as an outstanding mentor. She was grateful for his willingness to advise a young woman as she faced the extra challenges simply due to her gender. She noted that both of her two mentors, Dr. Schilling and Dr. Ris, greatly shaped and benefited her future. They were able to be gender blind when others could not and treated her as just another graduate student. With their support, she successfully graduated with her doctorate in 1960.  Personal life  While at the University of Wisconsin, Mary met a medical student named Richard Bunge, whom she married and shared her personal life as well as her career. They graduated together and moved to Columbia University to begin their post-doctorate research. Soon after settling in, the family doubled with the addition of two sons, Jonathan, born in 1962, and Peter, born in 1964. Since women perform most of the caregiving in society, they face more challenges than men in pursuing high level positions while balancing the family responsibilities. Bunge faced these challenges head on and was able to continue her career while attending to her motherhood responsibilities, but not without sacrifices. To balance family and work life, Bunge worked part-time for eight years as a Research Associate at Columbia University. It would have been too much for her to prepare lecture and teach on top of her research schedule and raising her sons, so she placed her tenure-track faculty member dream on hold. In 1970, the family moved to accept faculty positions at Washington University School of Medicine. She chose to be a Research Assistant Professor rather than be on the tenure-track so she could continue raising her sons, who were still young. Instead, she adjusted to a full-time schedule. By 1974, she had started to teach and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. She was promoted again in 1978 to Professor. She was grateful for the quality of environment at Washington University, which made it possible for her to continue her career while being a part of her children's lives.  Research  Richard also enriched Mary's life by introducing her to neuroscience, where she found her purpose and focused her research on while at Washington University School of Medicine. In particular, she focused on researching Schwann cells, which are cells that wrap around the axon of neurons to form the myelin sheath as an insulator to the neuron and to increase the speed impulses are conducted. One of her other major discoveries was that the oligodendrocyte was the cell that made the myelin sheath for the central nervous system. She first discovered this when she examined a section of a kitten's spinal cord in an electron microscope with the oligodendrocyte cell body forming myelin at each end. She also demonstrated that myelin could be reformed in the mature mammalian spinal cord, which has an important clinical relevance in addressing Multiple Sclerosis and spinal cord injuries, where the myelin has been damaged. Since 1989, Bunge has been a leading part of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at University of Miami School of Medicine, where her research on myelin has been implemented. Her husband was invited to be the scientific director of the project, so she was able to work with him there, and when he died in 1996 from esophageal cancer, she took his place at the forefront of the project. This was a common way for women of this era to acquire leading roles in projects. Women used the careers of their husbands to gain access to the resources to further their own careers, and when they died, the women were able to take their place, avoiding possible gender discrimination. The project Bunge took over tests regeneration strategies that could lead to successful treatment of spinal cord injury. She has the patent in ‚ÄúSchwann Cell Bridge Implants and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors to Stimulate CNS Nerve Regeneration‚Äù from 2009 for the application of restoring function after a central nervous system injury. She has dozens of other patents including \\"Methods and Systems for Neural Maintenance and Regeneration,\\" \\"Promoters of Neural Regeneration,\\" and \\"Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors for Cognitive and Motor Rehabilitation.\\" Her research is now being used for phase one of clinical trials, which gained approval from the FDA in 2012, to evaluate the safety of transplanting the Schwann cells of recently paralyzed patients into the site of their injury. Phase 1 of the clinical trial is the testing of the safety and efficacy of this technique. Each participant's own Schwann cells are obtained from sural nerve biopsy, which is above the ankle. By obtaining these cells from the participants, there is minimal concern for immune rejection. The cells are then purified and processed in a culturing facility to generate the number of cells necessary to be transplanted into the injury site. This cell therapy is combined with an intense exercise and rehabilitation regiment over ten months for the trial. The participants are to be monitored for 5 years. So far, Phase 1 has shown promising results as millions of Schwann cells have been successfully transplanted into four subjects with no adverse effects. While the trial has been occurring, Bunge has been working on other combination treatments for future clinical trials. In 2014, she published in the Journal of Neuroscience the promising results of a strategy tested in rat Schwann cells that were engineered to secrete the growth factor D15A and the enzyme Chondroitinase ABC which alters scar composition. This combination lead to more axonal regeneration and functional improvement. Bunge is extremely dedicated to her work, and although she considered retiring in 2010, she has remained in the lab to see through the success of the clinical trial.  Honors  Bunge has been a professor of cell biology, neurological surgery, and neurology at the University of Miami for 26 years now and has accumulated significant recognition for her research. In 1996, she received the Wakeman Award for Spinal Cord Repair. She is a three time recipient of the Javitis Neuroscience Investigator Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. She was the elected Chair of the Development of Women's Careers in Neuroscience Committee through the Society for Neuroscience from 1994 - 2002. In 2000, she received the Mika Salpeter Women In Neuroscience Lifetime Achievement Award for her leadership in advancing the careers of women in neuroscience. In 2001, she received the Christopher Reeve Research Medal for Spinal Cord Repair. She received the Christine E Lynn Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience Award in 2003 and the Lois Pope LIFE International Research Award in 2005. Her culminating recognition is being elected to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, which is an extraordinary honor that indicates the extent of her professional achievement and commitment to service in health and medicine. Just last year, she was named a Health Care Hero by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.

Broadsheet Format. La Tribuna was one of the most important daily newspapers in Paraguay's history. It was founded in 1925 in Asunci√≥n by Eduardo Schaerer, and was the country's leading newspaper for five decades. La Tribuna was the first Paraguayan paper to be widely published across the country. Politically, La Tribuna was positioned between liberalism and traditional national politics. It opposed especially the dictatorial regimes of Higinio Mor√≠√±igo and Alfredo Stroessner. During these dictatorial regimes, the editors became the target of persecution. Their crusade in favor of the Free Press in Paraguay gained attention abroad. In 1953, the newspaper's director, Arturo Schaerer, received the Mar√≠a Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University. History La Tribuna was founded in Asunci√≥n on December 31, 1925, by former Paraguayan president Eduardo Schaerer. La Tribuna was not Schaerer's first media outlet. In 1905, Eduardo Schaerer founded \\"The Journal\\" alongside Guadalberto Card√∫s Huerta and Adolfo Riquelme. After the death of President Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia in 1940, General Higinio Mor√≠nigo became President. Mor√≠nigo persecuted many politicians and well known members of the liberal party. This persecution of the independent press resulted in the closure of La Tribuna several times. General Alfredo Stroessner ascended to the Presidency of Paraguay in 1954. During his Presidency, La Tribuna continued to exist under similar circumstances and was constantly threatened. Schaerer asked for support from ambassadors and international contacts to keep the newspaper in operation. The continuing existence of La Tribuna worried the dictatorial government. Starting in 1954, La Tribuna's director had the support of Carlos Ruiz Apezteguia, who denounced the abuse and crimes of the government and the breakdown of the rule of law. In November 1956, La Tribuna was raided and Ruiz Apezteguia was arrested, tortured and then abandoned in a boat on the shores of Clorinda, Argentina. Ruiz Apezteguia began his exile in Montevideo, Uruguay. Under international pressure, Ruiz Apezteguia returned to Paraguay in 1959 and resumed his journalistic work in the newspaper. Despite the political unrest and the persecution La Tribuna was subjected to in the following decades, the newspaper grew into one of the most respected newspapers on the continent. La Tribuna had agencies in many countries and grew from a circulation of 2,000 daily copies at its founding to more than 70,000 by the year 1965. In 1953, Arturo Schaerer and his newspaper were given the oldest international journalism award, the Maria Moors Cabot prize from Columbia University, for the paper's work as independent press publication placing itself in opposition to the totalitarian regimes in Paraguay. Arturo Schaerer remained director of La Tribuna until May 15, 1972, when he was succeeded by Carlos Ruiz Apezteguia. At the time, Ruiz Apezteguia was a journalist and the husband of Schaerer's daughter, Myriam, and had been an involved partner and manager of La Tribuna for more than two decades. As director of La Tribuna, he denounced abuses in the negotiations associated with the Treaty of Itaipu and Yacyreta (with Brazil and Argentina respectively) on the construction of dams. With the creation of ABC Color in 1967, La Tribuna began to lose its space in the Paraguayan written press. At the end of 1977, the newspaper was closed and returned a year later, under the administration of Oscar Paciello. In that management, the newspaper presented an analytical editorial line and criticized certain aspects of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. This positioning bothered the Executive Branch, which suspended its printing and circulation between june and july 1979. Upon returning to activities, the newspaper maintained his criticism, but with some caution. By strong competition with other media, La Tribuna was closed again in October 1980, with the purpose of modernizing. Returning in March 1981, he presented a content with new printing techniques, but financial problems caused the quality of the newspaper to gradually decrease. After 57 years of existence, La Tribuna was closed definitively on September 24, 1983 and its facilities were sold to the Nicol√°s Bo Group which in 1984 inaugurated the Noticias.

The club was formed in the Spring of 2015, a merger between Lincoln Hockey Club and Lincoln Roses Hockey Club. Lindum Hockey Clubs plays its home games at the Lindum Sports Association on St Giles Avenue in Lincoln. The Men's 1st Team play in the North Hockey Association Premier Division, while the Ladies 1st Team play in the North Hockey Association Division One. The majority of the other teams compete in the Yorkshire Hockey League. As Lincoln's only field hockey club, the club fields seven men's teams, including two development sides, five ladies' teams, a veterans side, two mixed teams, and has a well established junior hockey section.  History  Despite being founded only relatively recently, the club's history stretches back over a combined 200-year period. Lincoln Roses Hockey Club began life as a part of the Sports Club of Rose Brothers (Gainsborough) Limited, a manufacturer of sweet wrapping equipment. Gainsborough Rose Hockey Club, as they were known at the time following an amalgamation with Gainsborough Ladies Hockey Club, started to take on organised hockey with the formation of the Lincolnshire Hockey League. Later, with the advent of artificial turf becoming the de facto playing surface in the sport, facilities were sought in Lincoln and in time a formal link with Lincoln University saw the club renamed Lincoln Roses Hockey Club. Lincoln Hockey Club was built on the foundations of Lincoln Ladies Hockey Club, started in 1898. The club's first links with the Lindum Sports Association came about in 1946 where the men‚Äôs club was also formerly created - named Lincoln Imps Hockey Club. The Lindum Sports Association was to be the base for both hockey clubs over the next 43 years before the need to use artificial turf took the club elsewhere in the city for their home games. In 1980 the two clubs were merged to become a single entity, continuing to be called Lincoln Imps Hockey Club, until 1998 when it became simply Lincoln Hockey Club. Olympic medalist and England / Great Britain International player Georgie Twigg is a former player of Lincoln Hockey Club.  The Merger  An attempt to arrange a merger between Lincoln Roses Hockey Club and Lincoln Hockey Club in the mid to late-2000s proved unsuccessful and the two clubs continued to provide opportunities to play hockey and promote the sport side- by-side in the same city. In 2013 a purpose-built artificial turf hockey pitch was laid at the Lindum Sports Association, in part funded by England Hockey and Sport England. Some of the logic behind the funding of the new facility was that two hockey clubs would benefit and so both Lincoln Hockey Club and Lincoln Roses Hockey Club were playing most of their home games at the same location. In early 2014, a team consisting of Gary Johnson, John Harrison, Mark Sadler and John Sisman put in place the plans and foundations for a merger of the two clubs. Extraordinary General Meetings were called at both clubs to present a vision for the future of hockey in Lincoln and, with that, both clubs formerly dissolved on 8 June 2015 and, on the same date, Lindum Hockey Club was created in their place.  Branding  In order to strike a balance between the two clubs, the decision was made to start afresh with branding. The new club name wouldn't involve any merging of the two former names but instead adopt the name used at the Lindum Sports Association, which is also used by other member clubs using the same facilities (the Lindum Cricket Club and Lindum Squash Club). The logo was inspired by Lindum Cricket Club's logo; the Roman of the 9th Roman Legion who founded Lindum Colonia.  2015 / 2016 Season  As well as the successful merger of the two former hockey clubs in the season, the season saw an affiliation in excess of 720 players. The Men's 1st Team also played Beeston Hockey Club at home in a cup clash that saw record crowds at the pitch-side, and the club organised and ran a successful Fireworks Event at the Lindum Sports Association.

Educated at Girton College, Cambridge, and Harvard Business School, she was a partner at McKinsey & Company for 10 years before joining Citigroup in 2004. In 2019, she was named president of Citigroup, and also CEO of Consumer Banking. In September 2020, Citigroup announced that she would replace Michael Corbat as CEO of the entire corporation in February 2021, becoming the first woman to head a major Wall Street bank. She was included on Fortune \\"Most Powerful Women in Business\\" list in 2014 and 2015 and has been called the \\"Number 1 Woman to Watch\\" for two consecutive years by American Banker. Early life and education Jane Fraser was born in St Andrews, Scotland. She attended Girton College, Cambridge, from 1985 to 1988, graduating with an BA (promoted to a MA per tradition) in economics. After graduation, she worked as a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Goldman Sachs, London, from July 1988 to July 1990, then as a brokerage associate for Asesores Burs√°tiles, a Madrid-based securities broker, from August 1990 to June 1992. In 1992 she enrolled at Harvard Business School, earning her MBA in 1994. McKinsey & Company In 1994 she joined McKinsey & Company, working in financial services and global strategy, eventually rising to partner. For the first six years she worked in New York, and for the last four years in London. She worked part-time while raising her young children. She wrote articles on globalization and was a co- author, with three other McKinsey employees, of the 1999 book Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm. As part of her research for the book, she traveled to China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and India to interview McKinsey clients about their global challenges. After hearing her speak about the book, Citigroup executive Michael Klein spent several years encouraging Fraser to make the move to Citigroup, which she eventually did in 2004. Citigroup Fraser was hired as Head of Client Strategy in Citigroup's investment and global banking division in July 2004. In October 2007 she was promoted to Global Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, a position she held until May 2009. Her tenure as Global Head coincided with the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2009, and she was part of the executive team that was \\"charged with restructuring the group, leading its re-engineering effort, making divestments and raising new capital\\". A Citi Private Bank office In June 2009 she was named CEO of Citi Private Bank. At the time of her promotion, the bank was running an annual deficit of approximately $250 million; it returned to the black during her four-year tenure. Among the changes she implemented were a decrease in the ratio of private bankers to clients, with a target of one banker for every 30 clients, and the removal of commissions and sales formulas for bankers in favor of a year-end discretionary bonus. In May 2013 she was asked to replace the retiring CEO of CitiMortgage. Though she knew the move was a career risk, she accepted the challenge. Her stewardship of Citigroup's mortgage division coincided with the marketwide drop in demand for mortgage refinancing, forcing the bank to refocus its efforts on selling residential mortgages to home buyers. Citigroup closed several mortgage offices nationwide and laid off 1,000 employees in September 2013 alone. Less than a year later, in March 2014, Fraser was promoted to CEO of US Consumer and Commercial Banking, succeeding Cecelia Stewart who announced her retirement. And in April 2015 she was named CEO of Citigroup Latin America, with responsibility for operations in 24 countries. The latter promotion followed a reshuffling of Citigroup executives sparked by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, CEO of Citigroup's global consumer bank. Medina-Mora was replaced by Stephen Bird, former CEO for the Asia-Pacific region, who in turn was replaced by Francisco Aristeguieta, former CEO of Citigroup Latin America. Now based in Miami, Fraser has been tasked with, among other things, \\"instilling a more U.S.-like culture\\" at Banamex (Banco Nacional de M√©xico), owned and operated by Citigroup since 2001. The bank was fined $2.2 million on fraud charges in 2014. The head of Banamex, Ernesto Torres Cantu, reports directly to Fraser. In October 2019, Fraser was appointed President of Citigroup and Head of Global Consumer Banking (GCB). In September 2020, Citigroup announced its CEO, Michael Corbat's retirement, to be effective in February 2021. Fraser was appointed to assume as CEO after Corbat, becoming the first female CEO of a Top-Tier Investment Bank. Memberships A member of the Citi Operating Committee, Fraser is one of only two women on that 24-member panel. She is also a member of the board of the Touch Foundation since 2006. Honours and recognition In 2015 Fraser was ranked number 41 on Fortune list of the 51 Most Powerful Women in Business, up from number 48 on the 2014 list. American Banker named her the \\"Number 1 Woman to Watch\\" both in 2014 and 2015. Personal Fraser is married and the mother of two sons. Her husband, a native of Cuba, left his job as a bank manager in Europe during the financial crisis of 2008 to spend more time caring for their young children. In June 2015 Fraser appeared on a CBS Local report about Citi Global Community Day, in which she and other volunteers spruced up the Liberty Square public housing project in Miami.

Later, it changed role and served in Sicily and Italy, and reformed in AA Command after the war. Origin As the international situation deteriorated in the late 1930s, the threat of air raids on the UK led to a rapid expansion in the numbers of anti-aircraft (AA) units manned by members of the part-time TA. Formed on 8 May 1939, the 75th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment of the Royal Artillery consisted of HQ and three searchlight batteries based at Cowley in Uxbridge.Frederick, p. 860.Litchfield, p. 180. World War II The Blitz 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth Anti-Aircraft Command mobilised in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September, and the regiment took its place in 38th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade (a formation composed entirely of searchlight units) in 1st AA Division, which had responsibility for defending London.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. Although AA Command and RAF Fighter Command had the advantage of the Chain Home radar network to detect air raids approaching the coastline, there was no radar coverage inland. In daylight, the Royal Observer Corps and searchlight detachments tracked the progress of raids visually; at night, sound location had to be used. 1st AA Division devised a system of 14 fixed base-lines of sound locators to detect night raids approaching the London Inner Artillery Zone. These were linked by automatic telephone equipment to the operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the Heavy AA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. Detachments of 75th S/L Rgt were trained to operate these baselines. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, in time for the opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced when searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced.Routledge, p. 389. London was attacked incessantly throughout the winter of 1940‚Äì41. 75th S/L Regiment served in 38 AA Bde in 1 AA Division in London through these raids until February 1941, when its role was changed.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Appendix D, p. 257. 75th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment On 15 February 1941, the regiment was re-equipped with light AA (LAA) guns and converted into 73rd (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, corrected on 26 February to 75th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment at Hanger Hill, Ealing, with 232, 233 and 234 LAA Batteries.Frederick, pp. 803‚Äì4, 807, 832.Farndale, Appendix M, p. 340.75 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 225th LAA Training Rgt at Newquay where they provided the basis for a new 303 LAA Bty formed on 18 September 1941. The battery joined the regiment on 9 December 1941 to replace 232 LAA Bty, which joined a newly forming 97th LAA Rgt. On 19 February 1942 the regiment formed a new 467 LAA Bty from cadres provided by its own 233 and 234 LAA Btys and by 277 LAA Bty of 83rd LAA Rgt. On 10 July 1942, 467 LAA Bty transferred to a newly-forming 141st LAA Rgt (it later served in the defence of Gibraltar).Joslen, p. 553.Routledge, pp. 204, 212. Early in 1943, 75th LAA Rgt was assigned to 76th AA Bde, which was training units for service overseas.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/11247. The regiment was then despatched to the Mediterranean to join Eighth Army for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). The assault went in early on 10 July 1943 against light opposition, and all Eighth Army's landings were successful. The town of Pachino was quickly secured, and 75th LAA's Bofors guns landed shortly afterwards to contribute to the AA defence of its airfield. Work started at once to repair this for use by the RAF, though this was interrupted by frequent day and night air raids. Even after the airfield was in operation, raids against it continued until the Luftwaffe withdrew to mainland Italy in mid-August. At this stage, 75th LAA Rgt had 233 and 234 Batteries protecting Pachino airfield and the beach, and 303 Battery at Cassibile Airfield.Joslen, p. 466.Routledge, pp. 261‚Äì3, Table XLII, p. 267. A Bofors gun crew in Italy, April 1944 Eighth Army captured the port of Taranto on the Italian mainland in September 1943 (Operation Baytown), and during October 8th AA Bde was landed there to defend the disembarkation ports and airfields in the 'heel' of Italy (southern Puglia) in a joint air defence organisation with the RAF. 75th LAA Rgt was one of the units assigned to this task, with one battery of 18 Bofors guns deployed at Brindisi Airfield, and the rest of the regiment as detachments at other airfields in the area.Routledge, p. 289. In December 1943, 25th AA Bde relieved 8th AA Bde and assumed command of 75th LAA Rgt. It upgraded the defence of Brindisi port by moving in another battery of 75th LAA Rgt.Joslen, p. 467.Routledge, pp. 290‚Äì1; Table XLVII, p. 296. However, as the Italian Campaign progressed, the region was becoming a backwater and the fighting units of Eighth Army urgently required manpower, so a reduction in AA units was begun in May 1944. 75th LAA Rgt was one of those selected for disbandment and on 8 September 1944, Regmental HQ with 233, 234 and 303 LAA Btys passed into suspended animation.and its personnel posted away.Routledge, Table XLIV, p. 293. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 75th LAA Rgt was reformed at Cowley as 610 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (Middlesex), forming part of 82 AA Bde (the former 56 AA Bde based at Heston).Frederick, p. 1026.<Litchfield, Appendix 5, p. 335.Farndale, Annex M, p. 340.592‚Äì638 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947.

The BCR&N;, with passenger and freight service between Minneapolis and St. Louis was considered the most important north- south rail line in Iowa. In 1903 the railroad was acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, and the freight house served that line. After the Rock Island Line went out of business the building sat empty until it was converted into a restaurant. The structure had to be restored after floods in 1993 and 2008 inundated it.

Pickering (July 9, 1916 ‚Äì November 18, 2015) was an American engineer, musical instrument designer, inventor and co-founder of the Audio Engineering Society. His most famous inventions are the modern Pickering cartridge, a high-fidelity, jewel-tipped phonographic cartridge, and the Pickering pickup. After leaving the audio technology company he founded, Pickering & Company, he developed ultrasound diagnostic techniques, studied violin acoustics, and constructed 37 violins. Biography Norman Pickering was born on Long Island on July 9, 1916 in Brooklyn to Herbert Pickering and Elsie Elliott Pickering. His father was a marine engineer, and his mother was a pianist. Norman learned to read music at an early age while sitting at his mother's side, and began playing violin at the age of 7 He was injured while playing baseball, which caused him to switch from violin to French horn. He wanted to study music, but his father, who thought music \\"was for sissies\\" asserted that he should study engineering. He graduated from Newark College of Engineering in 1936 with an electrical engineering degree. He then turned back to music, attending Juilliard School on a graduate scholarship. In 1937 he joined the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra as a French horn player, and was employed there until 1940. While in Indianapolis he started a recording studio as he was interested in the technical aspects. This work caused the C.G. Conn company to hire him in 1940, where he researched the acoustic properties of their musical instruments. At the beginning of World War II, the Conn facility was converted from manufacturing musical instruments to aircraft instruments for the Sperry Gyroscope Company. Sperry offered Pickering a position which allowed him to return to Long Island. He held this position from 1942 until 1945. While there he played French horn with the Sperry Symphony, but it also generated in Pickering an interest in aircraft, which led him to develop a design for vibration control in Boeing aircraft. His most famous invention came in 1945 when Pickering, frustrated with the acoustical limitations of sound reproduction from phonograph records, developed a pickup (a device which translates the vibrations of the needle into electrical impulses for amplification) which reduced record wear and significantly increased the accuracy of the sounds coming through the speaker. Pickering felt that phonograph records recorded sound at reasonable levels of fidelity, but that the reproduction standards were not acceptable. Listening to the results from his new device, Pickering felt that the improvement in sound \\"wasn't just a little, it was magnificent.\\" Further development resulted in the Pickering cartridge. Pickering showed Sumner Hall, who had recorded the Sperry Symphony at a Carnegie Hall concert, some prototypes of his pickup. Hall encouraged development, and Pickering & Co was started in November 1945. Initially the Pickering apparatus was only marketed for professional use in recording studios and radio stations, but by 1947 it became clear that there was potential in the consumer market. Pickering made his designs for 78rpm records, and the 1948 introduction of the LP record caught him off-guard. As a result, he had to completely re-work his design. In 1948, Pickering was among the founders of the Audio Engineering Society. In the 1950s he worked on further improving sound reproduction through tone-arm and variable equalizer modifications. He developed one of the earliest speaker towers. He was a visiting professor of acoustics at City College of New York from 1952 until 1955. In the 1970s, he was employed at the Southampton Hospital, researching ultrasonic technology, where he developed a method to detect eye diseases. He continued his involvement with music by participating with the Paumanok Ensemble. Later, in the 1980s, he returned to the violin by making instruments, doing consulting work for d'Addario, and as president of The Violin Society of America. He died at his East Hampton, New York residence, of cancer, on November 18, 2015. Personal life Pickering was married three times. His last marriage was in 1979 to Barbara Goldowsky. He had one daughter, three sons, and two step-sons.

Its headwaters are near the Musquodoboit Valley and the river flows southeast and empties in to the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia. The river has three main tributaries: West River Main, Killag River and Little River. The river was suffering from acidification, so a lime doser was installed and has been in use since September 2005. It stabilized the river's pH at 5.5, a healthy level for aquatic life. Geography The West River system, along with the East River watershed system, comprise a total area of 988 km2. The West River system has three main tributaries: West River, Killag River and Little River. West River is the main tributary of the West River system. It is approximately long and its headwaters are northwest of Beaver Dam. The river is prone to flash-flooding. There are two lake-like pools on the river. The first and more southerly one is Sheet Harbour Lake, which has an area of 1.2 km2 and is located near the West River Falls in Sheet Harbour. The other lake is Little Lake, which is more inland in the system and has an area of 0.5 km2. Killag River and Little River both discharge in to the Main West River. Killag River begins at West Lake and Little River flows from Lake Alma. West River then flows through Sheet Harbour Lake, then down the West River Falls and discharges in to the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour. Killag River is a secondary tributary of the West River system. It is approximately long. Its headwaters are at an altitude of . Most of the salmon in the river system breed on the Killag River. Killag River discharges in to West River. Little River is the other secondary tributary of the river system. Its headwaters are in Lake Alma, a shallow lake at an altitude of . Little River is approximately long. Little River discharges in to West River. History In 1922, a ground- wood pulp mill, owned by the American Pulp and Wrapping Paper Co. of Albany, began operation on the West River Falls. They had purchased it from Rhodes and Currie, the previous owners who were a lumber company. It produced its first ground-wood pulp on October 5, 1925. It remained in operation until it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in August 1971. West River has been dosed with a lime doser since September 2005. Sheet Harbour was the first community in North America to equip a lime doser on one of its rivers. It was the result of the worsening salmon population in Atlantic Canada rivers, which is being caused be acid rain and low pH levels.

(\\"Forward!\\" or literally \\"Go On!\\") was a Norwegian-language newspaper, important for its role in promoting socialism to a Scandinavian immigrant audience in the United States in the early 20th century. It was established at Girard, Kansas in November 1903, and moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota the following year. The Norwegian-language press played an important role in society as one of the main vehicles of communication and education. Between 1865 and 1914, 565 papers and magazines existed in the United States, with newspapers founded in every large town where Norwegians lived and in many small towns as well. Gaa Paa was particularly notable because it lasted for over two decades which was a long run in the world of left-wing papers of the time. The Norwegian-American press served immigrants who could not yet read English and was a source of cultural life for those immigrants who were most comfortable reading and speaking their mother tongue, as well as a way to keep cultural ties alive for the next generation. The papers covered a broad range of topics; educating readers on the history and government of their new country; commenting on local agricultural news and on news from Europe and Norway; entertaining with poems and literature, and acting as organs for a variety of political views. In the case of Gaa Paa, its socialist views came under scrutiny in the World War I period and it changed its name in 1918 in an effort to avoid a ban from the US Mail, taking the name Folkets R√∏st (People's Voice). It appeared under that title until October 1925. Its demise coincided with the aging of the socialist couple who published the paper for over two decades, Helle and Emil Mengshoel. In the aftermath of the 1919 split of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) which led to the establishment of the Communist Party of America (CPA) and Communist Labor Party of America (CLP), Folkets R√∏st remained allied with the social democratic SPA and promoted the candidacies of other like-minded groups. The weekly newspaper was the largest and longest-running radical Dano-Norwegian (Bokm√•l) periodical in North America. Publication history Establishment Julius A. Wayland (1854-1912), first publisher and financial angel of Gaa Paa. In 1903, Julius A. Wayland, publisher of the national weekly Appeal to Reason, decided to launch a Norwegian-language socialist newspaper from his base of operations at Girard, Kansas, a small town located in the southeastern part of the state.Odd S. Lovoll, Norwegian Newspapers in America: Connecting Norway and the New Land. Minneapolis, MN: Minnesota Historical Society, 2010; pp. 263-264. Wayland‚Äôs paper made the small farming community into a ‚ÄúMecca for Socialism‚Äù according to one author. Wayland realized that many Scandinavian immigrants were disposed to join the socialist movement and he wanted to recruit them to the socialist cause. Wayland invited the married socialist activists Emil Lauritz Mengshoel and Helle Cr√∏ger Mengshoel to relocate to Kansas to edit this new publication.Lovoll, Norwegian Newspapers in America, pg. 264. Emil Mengshoel had had experience with several papers at this point, and as a committed socialist, he was happy to leave his position at the conservative Republikaneran, based in Iowa. The plan was for the new paper to share the costs of publishing with Appeal to Reason. Wayland had met Emil Mengshoel ‚Äî the editor of the radical Minnesota Populist newspaper Nye Normanden (New Norseman) ‚Äî though his prior contributions to the Appeal to Reason, making him a logical choice for the editorial desk. Helle Cr√∏ger Mengshoel was a formidable activist in her own right, having worked previously as a trade union organizer in Christiana, Norway (today's Oslo).Robert L. Mikkelsen, \\"Norwegians,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: Volume 1: Migrants from Northern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 192. She was friends with many prominent Norwegian socialists and some of her letters are available through the archives of the Norwegian-American Historical Society. The couple assented to Wayland's request, moved to Kansas, and on November 29, 1903 the first issue of Gaa Paa (Forward) rolled from the Appeal's presses. Burdened by other tasks, Wayland soon decided to step down from his direct role as publisher of Gaa Paa, instead subsidizing publication of the paper through direct donations. The paper continued to be edited by the Mengshoels, joined by Helle Mengshoel's son, Andrew O. Devold, to make an editorial board of three. Throughout its history Gaa Paa would remain, in the words of historian Odd S. Lovoll, \\"basically a family venture\\". In the fall of 1904, the paper was moved to Minneapolis, closer to its primary readership in the Norwegian immigrant communities of the Upper Midwest, where it would remain for the next two decades. The move was completed during the second half of October 1904, with offices established at 1910 East Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis,\\"City News,\\" Minneapolis Journal, Oct. 22, 1904, pg. 7. in the heart of the Scandinavian enclave in the Twin Cities. There, the paper was close to advertisers and could form mutually beneficial relationships with socialist organizations. Development Gaa Paa publishers and editors Helle and Emil Mengshoel as they appeared in 1899. Gaa Paa was bolstered by the establishment of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation (Skandinaviske Socialistforbund) in 1910, a national organization which united local Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish language socialist clubs scattered around the United States.Odd S. Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" Minnesota Historical Society, vol. 52, no. 3 (Fall 1990), pg. 88. The organization of the disparate groups helped Gaa Paa's position as the only Dano-Norwegian (Bokm√•l) socialist weekly, but in 1911, the paper soon was challenged when the Scandinavian Federation launched its own publication, Social-Demokraten (The Social Democrat).Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 90. A feud developed between the privately owned and the Federation-owned papers as they battled for subscribers in a fairly limited market.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pp. 90-91. Gaa Paa was regarded by one contemporary observer as \\"the reddest and most radical of Norwegian newspapers,\\"J.B. Wist, \\"Pressen etter borgerkrigens slutning\\" (The Press After the Civil War) in Norsk-amerikanernes festskrift, 1914 (Norwegian-Americans' Memorial Volume, 1914). Decorah, IA: Symra Company, 1914. Quoted in Mikkelsen, \\"Norwegians,\\" pg. 192. touting itself on its masthead as the \\"Organ for Scandinavian Workers in America.\\" The paper based its editorial line upon the principles of International Socialism, with emphasis placed on the notion of class struggle.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 93. Despite its purple prose, however, the paper steered far away from the anti- political industrial union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), explicitly disavowing that organization's commitment to the use of the tactics of sabotage and direct action. Rather than holding to an apocalyptic view of attaining socialism through armed revolution, editor Mengshoel was influenced by the ideas of writers Laurence Gronlund and Edward Bellamy, emphasizing the functional superiority of the economic form of state ownership and the implication that evolution to socialist production and distribution would be a protracted, inevitable, evolutionary process. In other words, the Mengshoels believed that by educating workers about the benefits of capitalism, socialism would prevail by peaceful means - at the ballot box. Gaa Paa attained a circulation of 5,000 in 1912Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 87. and managed to maintain a largely stable readership of about 4,500 during the years up to American entry into World War I. Gaa Paa had a national readership and published work by writers from Norway to North Dakota well as from enclaves of Norwegian-American radicalism located in Seattle and Astoria, Oregon.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 92. The paper also opened a business office in the Midwestern ethnic metropolis of Chicago. In 1914, Andrew Devold, (Helle Mengshoel's son from her first marriage) threw his hat into the political ring on the Socialist Party ticket and won election to the Minnesota state legislature. He became the second Socialist elected to that body in the state. Devold was at the time listed as editor and publisher of Gaa Paa together with his stepfather, Emil Mengshoel. After leaving Gaa Paa in 1917, Devold went on to win election to the Minnesota State Senate in November 1918.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 95. He held public office continuously from 1914 until his death in office in 1939. His legislative work focused on passing labor laws, and he is credited as authoring the first universal eight-hour law.In Memoriam: Andrew Olaf Devold, Hennepin County Bar Association, February 1940, p. 2. Wartime repression In an effort to dodge a prohibition from the US Mail, Gaa Paa was forced to change its name to Folkets R√∏st in 1918. In contrast to the overwhelming majority of the Norwegian-American press, Gaa Paa maintained an anti-war orientation even after American entry into World War I in April 1917.Carl H. Chrislock, Ethnically Challenged: The Upper Midwest Norwegian- American Experience in World War I. Northfield, MN: Norwegian-American Historical Association, 1981; pg. 66. While taking a position of \\"undiscriminating hate\\" of \\"German junkerdom, English aristocracy, and American money power,\\" primary editor Emil Mengshoel expressed sympathy for Minneapolis socialists who dared to resist conscription. The paper never was so bold as to explicitly advocate resistance to registration and the draft, instead attempting to toe the fine line of legality while remaining true to the anti-militarist St. Louis proclamation of the Socialist Party of America. As with other non-English publications, Gaa Paa was also faced with the burdensome task of supplying English translations of all political articles and editorial comments during the wartime years.Chislock, Ethnically Challenged, pp. 75-76. Efforts to soften tone and comply with statutory regulations in order to appease federal authorities proved inadequate for Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, however, and in 1918 Gaa Paa was denied access to the United States mails. This proved a harsh blow to the financially unstable publication, threatening its survival. In an effort to keep the publishing operation alive, the Mengshoels resorted to an artifice widely used to beat European censorships, relaunching their publication with a new name, Folkets R√∏st (People's Voice) ‚Äî a name regarded as one less militant than Gaa Paa. The old publication was shut down in October 1918 with the ostensibly \\"new\\" paper first seeing print on December 21, 1918, following a pause in publication of some two months.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 98. Socialist split of 1919 Gaa Paa moved away from the Socialist Party slightly in the spring of 1918, when it began printing columns written by Sigvald R√∏dvick, top Norwegian-language official in the national office of the Non-Partisan League (NPL), a rival organization.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 96. The publication lent its editorial support not only to the Socialist Party candidacy of former editor Andrew Devold for the Minnesota State Senate and to pro-war Socialist Thomas Van Lear in his bid for reelection as Mayor of Minneapolis, but also to the candidate of the NPL for Governor of Minnesota, Charles A. Lindbergh. Following the split of the Socialist Party in the summer of 1919 into Socialist and Communist factions, with the latter forming rival organizations known as the Communist Party of America (CPA) and the Communist Labor Party of America (CLP), the Mengshoels remained loyal to the old organization, putting them at odds with the bulk of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation, which along with a number of other language federations of the Socialist Party quit the organization to join the fledgling Communist organizations. By the election of 1922 Folkets R√∏st had reduced itself to supporting only three Socialist candidates, including Andrew Devold, with the bulk of its support lent instead to the candidates of the Farmer-Labor Party. This political maneuver, in addition to helping return Andrew Devold to the Minnesota Senate, had the additional benefit of temporarily boosting circulation figures, with the paper managing to briefly match its pre-war press run.Lovoll, \\"Gaa Paa: A Scandinavian Voice of Dissent,\\" pg. 99. This boom would prove to be short- lived however, and Folkets R√∏st found itself facing termination fewer than three years later. Termination and legacy A combination of factors led to the demise of Folkets R√∏st in October 1925, including a fragmentation of the market for the radical Norwegian-language press resulting from the Socialist-Communist split, a gradual decline in the number of Norwegian speakers in America, and the declining health of editors Helle and Emil Mengshoel. Helle Menshoel's declining health prevented her from assisting with production of the paper during her final years. She died in 1929. The newspaper also found itself in dire financial straits, with Emil Mengshoel forced to find outside employment to help support the family. The quality of the paper declined and it was briefly reduced to a bimonthly publication schedule prior to its final termination. A partial run of Gaa Paa and Folkets R√∏st is available on microfilm, with the master negative held by the Minnesota Historical Society.

The update to US law explicitly allows US citizens and industries to \\"engage in the commercial exploration and exploitation of space resources\\" including water and minerals. The right does not extend to extraterrestrial life, so anything that is alive may not be exploited commercially. Overview The law was passed on 21 May 2015 to allow US industries to \\"engage in the commercial exploration and exploitation of space resources\\", but it asserts that \\"the United States does not [by this Act] assert sovereignty, or sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any celestial body.\\" Some scholars argue that the United States recognizing ownership of space resources is an act of sovereignty, and that the act violates the Outer Space Treaty.If space is ‚Äòthe province of mankind‚Äô, who owns its resources?

This has created a controversy on claims and on mining rights for profit. The SPACE Act includes the extension of indemnification of US launch providers for extraordinary catastrophic third-party losses of a failed launch through 2025, while the previous indemnification law was scheduled to expire in 2016. The Act also extends, through 2025, the \\"learning period\\" restrictions which limit the ability of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enact regulations regarding the safety of spaceflight participants. Indemnification for extraordinary third-party losses has, as of 2015, been a component of US space law for over 25 years, and during this time, \\"has never been invoked in any commercial launch mishap.\\" Businessweek has summarized one effect of the legislation as \\"American citizens could keep anything they brought back from space.\\"  Legislative history  Part of the origin of the law lies in the proposed Asteroids Act introduced by Representatives Bill Posey (R-FL) and Derek Kilmer (D-WA) in July 2014. That act was supported by lobbying efforts by Planetary Resources, a Washington-based company that hopes to commercially mine asteroids. Additional lobbying by Deep Space Industries and Bigelow Resources, two other companies with commercial interests in space, helped the proposed Asteroids Act along, which was later rolled into the SPACE Act. The House of Representatives passed the legislation in May 2015 and the Senate subsequently passed similar legislation. The legislation was reconciled between the House of Representatives and the Senate, then moved to the executive branch for signing or vetoing before 20 November 2015.

Life He was born in Brindisi. He reached Naples in 1629, where he probably studied under Jusepe de Ribera (according to Bernardo De Dominici), but according to other documents he frequently attended the studio of a certain Pietro Beato, marrying Beato's niece Angela Formichella in 1636. De Dominici saw his style as almost identical with that of Ribera, but modern critics find his style so different from Ribera's that it is thought to be close to that of Massimo Stanzione and Agostino Beltrano, whom he probably also studied under during his time with Beato. He died in Naples. Works The Adoration of the Shepherds by Passante, S√£o Paulo Museum of Art There are two signed works by Passante - The Adoration of the Shepherds at The Prado and a Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine in a private collection in Naples. Saint Sebastian Tended by Pious Women (London), Holy Family with Saint Joseph Sleeping (private collection, Causa), a large Adoration of the Shepherds (in a Swedish church - perhaps the painting cited by De Dominici as being in the church of San Giacomo degli Spagnoli in Naples according to Giuliano Briganti), a Saint Catherine of Alexandria (Palazzo Madama, Turin) and a Triumph (private collection in Rome) are all also attributed to him for stylistic reasons. At the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art there's another Adoration of the Shepherds attributed to him. SpinosaNicola Spinosa, Bartolomeo Bassante. Santa Caterina d'Alessandria, in Civilt√† del Seicento a Napoli, exhibition catalogue, Napoli 1984, scheda n. 2.5, p. 189 argued that Passante is to be identified with the Master of the Annunciation to the Shepherds - the latter was active in Naples in the mid 17th century. This is no longer held to be plausible given Passante's short lifespan and was based on an assumption that he survived until the mid 17th century, now disproved by a document dating his death to 1648.

From an 1898 edition of Saxo Grammaticus' chronicles (Gesta Danorum). Louis Moe (20 April 1857 ‚Äì 23 October 1945) was a Norwegian painter, illustrator and writer who settled in Denmark. He is known for his many book illustrations, illustrated classical works, fairytales, children's books and books on mythology, and contributed to children's magazines and weekly magazines. He is represented in the National Gallery in Oslo, and the Danish Museum of Art & Design in Copenhagen. Personal life Moe was born in Arendal to a dentist, Halvor Georg Theodor Moe, and Hansine Constance Halling. He was a nephew of priest and labour movement pioneer, Honoratus Halling. He married Inger M√∏ller in 1897. Career Moe studied with sculptor Julius Middelthun in Christiania, and later at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, and eventually settled in Denmark, becoming a naturalized Danish citizen in 1919. He is best known for his many book illustrations. He illustrated classical works as well as fairytales and children's books. He was also a graphic artist, and several of his works had decadent erotic motifs, such as naked women with monsters or animals. Among his paintings are Portrettgruppe (portrait group) from 1887, J√¶tte√¶tt (1888), Bondepige fra Norges Vestkyst (farmer girl from the West Coast of Norway) from 1891, and Drageoffer (Dragon victim) from 1894. From 1897 he regularly spent several months every year at his summer farm Juvlands√¶ter in Vr√•dal in Kviteseid, Norway, and Telemark was an important source of inspiration for his artistical work. He published the book Langt, langt borte i Skoge! (Far, far away in the woods) in 1904. Solveig Muren Sanden from Vr√•dal, one of the first significant female Norwegian comics illustrators, was guided by Moe as a young girl. Moe's illustrations of classical literature include an 1898 edition of Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum, the Old Norse Poetic Edda, and works by Johan Herman Wessel and Ludvig Holberg. Among his mythological works is the illustration of Tvermose- Thyregod's Oldemoders Fort√¶lling om Nordens Guder (Great grandmother's story of Norse Gods) (1890), Ragnarok. En Billeddigtning from 1929, and Valkyrjen from 1931. Moe delivered illustrations to the children's magazine Magne and the weekly magazine Norsk Ukeblad for many years. Moe is represented in the National Gallery in Oslo, the Danish Museum of Art & Design in Copenhagen and in Rasmus Meyers Samlinger in Bergen, and a Louis Moe Gallery has been established in Vr√•dal. He was decorated Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1931. He died in Copenhagen in 1945.

The fontana del Senato on Via degli Staderari, re-using a fountain basin from the baths.

These thermae were the second large public baths built in Rome, after the Baths of Agrippa, and it was probably the first \\"imperial-type\\" complex of baths, with a monumental scale and symmetrical, axially-planned design. While in the sixteenth century the foundations of the caldarium were still visible, nothing else of the structure remains above ground except some fragments of walls incorporated into the structure of Palazzo Madama. The thermae covered an area of about 190 by 120 metres. Their extent is shown by the modern-day piazza della Rotonda, via del Pozzo delle Cornacchie and via della Dogana Vecchia which now cover the site. The complex's water was initially supplied by the Aqua Virgo - already supplying the neighbouring Baths of Agrippa - then by the newly built Aqua Alexandrina after its restoration in the reign of the early third century emperor Alexander Severus, after whom it was subsequently renamed, though some continued to give it Nero's name.CIL VI.3052; Sid. Apoll. Carm. 23.495; Cassiod. Varia II.39.5: piscina Neroniana. The restoration was part of the extensive building program that Severus undertook during his reign, which also included the restoration of the Baths of Caracalla, the Colosseum, the Temple of Serapis, Circus Maximus, and the Alexandrian nymphaeum, among others. There is some contradiction among ancient sources with regards to whether the Baths of Nero and the Baths of Alexander are the same. Some affirmed that they are identical, while some claim that the two structures were merely close to each other. It is also suggested that the Severus added his baths to the existing facility built by Nero. Its construction was celebrated by a probable depiction of the baths on a coin of Alexander Severus.H. Cohen, Monnaies frapp√©es sous l'Empire. 2nd ed. 8 vols. Paris, 1880‚Äë1892, - Alex. Sev. 17; F. Gnecchi, Medaglioni romani. vol. II.101.6. According to Sidonius Apollinaris, it was still in use in the fifth century.Sid. Apoll. Carm. 23.495 Its appearance is known from Renaissance drawings made by Palladio and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and may substantially represent the design as it was the time of Nero. The overall layout of the baths has been confirmed by archaeological findings.John R. Patterson, \\"The City of Rome: From Republic to Empire\\", The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 82 (1992), p. 188. It fronted north, and was aligned with its walls facing the points of the compass. In the centre of the colder northern side was the natatio (swimming pool) flanked by two lateral peristyles, which may have been used as palaestrae. At the centre was the frigidarium with four adjoining chambers in the corners, flanked on either side by two apodyteria (changing rooms). South of these a tepidarium flanked by two rooms that may have been sudatoria or laconica (steam rooms) led finally to the southern, hottest end of the complex, where the caldarium stood projecting from the walls on either side, receiving the most sunlight and surrounded by praefurnia or propignea - chambers leading to the furnaces heating the whole thermae. An account stated that forests had been officially designated as sources for its heating fuel and that special taxes were imposed for its maintenance. Pipes from the Neronian structure were discovered between the piazza and the Salita dei Crescenzi. Neronian opus caementicium - concrete - has also been discovered. Brick stamps dating from the re-building by Alexander Severus were found in the remains of a hypocaust in Palazzo Madama in 1871. Another hypocaust was found on the site of San Salvatore in Thermis.\\"Thermae Neronianae or Alexandrinae\\" S. B. Platner, (as completed and revised by Thomas Ashby): A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, London: Oxford University Press, 1929. pp. 531-532. The ruins have been the source for numerous architectural fragments and sculptures re-used in subsequent centuries. Columns of grey granite, pavonazzetto, and even imperial porphyry were used in the architecture. Some of these, and their white marble capitals, have been found on the site. Several carved stone baths, including an \\"enormous basin for a fountain 6.70 metres in diameter, cut from a single block of red granite, with pieces of several others\\" have been found, together with the two complete basins described below.ibid. pp. 531. A monumental monolithic grey granite basin, a labrum, was removed from the site of the baths to the Villa Medici and was in the late eighteenth century moved to Florence. Since 1840, it has stood in the Medici's Boboli Gardens in Florence. The ruins of the baths also supplied an ornate column capital from the third century renovations of the baths. This capital, carved in relief with scenes of athletic triumph and the wreathing of the victor, was used as the base for the ancient Roman bronze fountain called the il Pignone when it was moved to its present position in the exhedra of the Vatican's cortile della Pigna in 1608. In the seventeenth century, during a renovation of the nearby Pantheon ordered by Pope Alexander VII, three pink granite columns from the Baths of Nero were used to replace the row of three columns on the damaged extreme eastern end of the Pantheon's pronaos. These columns are themselves badly damaged.De Fine Licht, K (1968). The Rotunda in Rome: A Study of Hadrian‚Äôs Pantheon. Copenhagen: Jutland Archaeological Society. pp. 241‚Äì242).Grasshoff, G., & Berndt, C. (2014). Decoding the Pantheon Columns. Architectural Histories, 2(1), Art. 18. Another column of pink granite was removed and re-erected in 1896 near the Porta Pia as a triumphal column supporting a winged victory in bronze and dedicated to the Breach of Porta Pia during the 1870 Capture of Rome, the final military action of Italian unification. Two further granite columns from the baths have been re-erected on-site beside the minor basilica of Sant'Eustachio. In the late 1980s, building work on the erstwhile Medici residence the Palazzo Madama, now seat of the Italian Senate, brought to light another monumental stone basin - round and of bichromatic black-red Egyptian granite. The basin, which probably stood in the caldarium for hot-water bathing, was restored (it had broken in three places) and was donated by the president of the Senate Giovanni Spadolini to the citizenry of Rome with a public ceremony. It is now a fountain - the fontana del Senato - on a Renaissance pedestal in the area since renamed piazza della Costituente, which connects via degli Staderari with via della Dogana vecchia and the piazza Sant'Eustachio.

Now below street level, they are the only Roman remains still standing in the city and form a thermae complex. History They were given the misnomer 'of Nero' in the medieval period, when they were believed to have been part of a palace - the earliest level actually dates to the final decades of the 1st century, during the reign of Domitian, as suggested by the use of the opus vittatum mixtum building technique with alternating layers of brick and tuff blocks. It was rebuilt during the 2nd century, as evidenced by an inscription (CIL XI, 1433, now held in National Museum of San Matteo) which cites the Veruleii Aproniani family,J. Scheid, Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Dr. Rudolf Habelt GmbH, Bonn (Germany), 1983, p. 225-228. well- known for owning extensive grounds and ceramics factories. In particular Lucius Venuleius Apronianus Priscus financed the rebuilding.Mario Torelli, Studies in the Romanization of Italy, University of Alberta, 1995, . He was a patronus of Roman Pisa and consul of Attidium (a Roman city near present-day Fabriano), who held a number of offices in the Antonine period. As was typical of public figures in the Roman world, he funded several building projects - in 92 he built the Caldaccoli Aqueduct and he also funded a building in Corliano. The best-preserved part of the complex is the sudatio laconicum (hot room), composed of an octagonal room with an apse, with a dome-shaped perforated roof, which has been partially restored. There are also the remains of some of the walls of the palaestra of the apodyterium and two walls from the tepidarium. Marble remains and some decorative sculptures have also been found. Its water was supplied by the nearby river Auser and from the Caldaccoli Aqueduct. They were re-discovered and restored in the 16th and 17th centuries by command of Cosimo III, excavated in 1881 by Clemente Lupi, fenced off in 1938 (after the demolition of some neighbouring houses) and finally fully restored in 1947.Paolo Gianfaldoni, Chiese e Porte nella storia di Pisa, C.L.D.

The American Immigration Council states that the majority of these immigrant women come from Mexico, meaning that the main demographic of immigrant women in the U.S. are Latina. As the fastest growing minority group in America, Latinas are becoming primary influencers in education, economics and culture in American society and the consumer marketplace.  Definition of a Latina  The word Latina is the feminine form of the word Latino, and represents strictly the female population of this ethnic group. The word Latino is short for LatinoAmericano, which translates to Latin American. It was originally adopted in the US for the purpose of additional categorization of the population in the United States Census. It is important to note that Latino/a is an ethnic category, and one that encompasses various racial groups. Latinas are women of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central American, South American, or Spanish origin. Though Brazil is part of Latin America, it is not a Spanish-speaking country, and is excluded from the category of Latinos by the United States Census office.  History of Latina Migration  Bracero Program 1970‚ÄìPresent The 1970s marked the first decade in which a gender shift occurred in Mexican migration.Cornelius, W.A. and A. Marcelli Enrico, 2000, \\"The changing profile of Mexican migrants to the United States: new evidence from California and Mexico.\\" IZA Discussion paper No. 220. http://www.iza.org/ During this time, more single women and more families began to migrate along with the working males who had already been migrating for several decades. This difference in gender migration is largely attributed to the difference in Latino and Latina work opportunities in the United States. Prior to the 1970s, the majority of the Latino migratory work was agriculturally based. However, with the end of the Bracero program, the United States policy on migration within the hemisphere shifted from encouraging primarily working males to migrate. Beginning with the Watershed amendment of 1965, the United States shifted their policy to encourage the migration of whole families by issuing less visas to unskilled single men and more visas to families. This marked the beginning of a large increase in Latina migration. While men typically migrate at a young age concentration of 18-25, females migrate at generally consistent rates at all age groups. This signals a difference in motives for female migration. While Latinos almost always migrate to the United States in search of work, Latina migration follows a pattern heavily tied to family life. Likewise, the early waves of the Cuban migration were primarily families. After they Bay of Pigs failure, many middle class Cuban families sought escape from the newly communist Cuba in the United States. 1961 and 1962 were marked by full family Cuban immigration. Thus, many Cuban women found themselves in the United States as a result of their family. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ability for Cubans to immigrate with their families became limited as a result of strained US-Cuba relations. This led to Cubans use of flotillas in order to make it to the southern coast of Florida.  Reasons For Latina Migration  While the primary reason for immigration into the United States for Latinas is economic improvement, the betterment of family life remains an important factor. Latina women also migrate with their families in an effort to seek refuge from violence and political instability in their native countries. Violent events in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras the number of Latinas entering the United States with families has nearly doubled in 2015. Likewise, many Latina women identified their primary reason for immigration was to reunite with family already in the United States.  Health  The Hispanic paradox refers to the medical research indicating that Latino immigrants enter the United States with better health, on average, than the average American citizen, but lose this health benefit the longer they reside in the United States. It is important to note that this health paradox affects both male and female populations of Latinos. Likewise, immigrant Latina women are found to have a lower infant mortality rate than U.S. born women. This has been explained by the tendency for Hispanic women to continue breastfeeding for a longer amount of time.Page, R. L. \\"Differences in Health Behaviors of Hispanic, White, and Black Childbearing Women: Focus on the Hispanic Paradox.\\" Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences: 300-12. Print. The Affordable Care Act does not cover non-citizens nor does it cover immigrants with less than 5 years of residency. As a result, Latino immigrants struggle to gain health care once they enter the United States. Non-citizen Latinos often avoid hospitals and clinics for fear of deportation, leading to an increased risk of preventable diseases such as tuberculosis and Hepatitis in this population.Liete, Paula, Adela Angoa, Xochitl Castaneda, and Emily Felt. \\"Health Outcomes of Mexican Immigrant Women in the United States.\\" Migrationpolicy.org. 2 Apr. 2013. Web. 15 Dec. 2015. Additionally, Latino health deteriorates as this population assimilates into unhealthy lifestyles associated with lower socioeconomic American populations.  Latina Women in the Workforce  Immigration to the United States offers new economic prospects for Latina women. While many Latina women work outside the home in their countries of origin, their efforts in the U.S. often yield more economic benefits. The Institute of Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame comments on this idea with Mexican women in mind, claiming that \\"much of the work that women do in the United States generates more income than it would in Mexico, allowing women to be much more financially independent.\\" This financial independence allows these women more freedom to act as the head of household. Though economic conditions in the U.S. are often better for these immigrants than in the countries from which they came, they are nowhere near those that men and even women of other ethnicities enjoy. Latina women make disproportionately less money than their male and non-Hispanic white counterparts. These disparities in wage and job availability leave this portion of the United States population more vulnerable to poverty and its implications. Though it is common knowledge that women in the United States make less than their male counterparts, this wage gap further varies by ethnicity. On average, Latina women make 55 cents to the dollar when compared to white, non-Hispanic males while white women make 78.1 cents to the same dollar. This discrepancy between white and Latina women continues further. The number of working poor Latina women is more than double that of white women, and poverty rates for Latinas are nearly triple those of white women. The elimination of this wage gap, on average, equates to: 194 more weeks of food for a Latina's family, more than 17 more months of mortgage and utility payments, nearly 27 more months of rent, or 12,342 additional gallons of gas. These wage gaps in the workforce affect Latinas at every socioeconomic status, not just the working class. Latina women are the most likely group to be paid at or below the minimum wage, with 5.7% of wage and salary workers earning this amount. Of women in the workforce with advanced degrees (master's, professional, and doctoral degrees), Latinas earn the lowest median weekly earnings of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Despite discrimination in the workforce, Latina participation is on the rise. From 1970 to 2007 Latinas have seen a 14% increase in labor force participation, which the Center for American Progress calls \\"a notable rise.\\" Of the Latinas participating in the labor force, 32.2% work in the service sector, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This percentage is significantly higher than that of white women, who fall at 20%. Conversely, Latinas are underrepresented in various other sectors of the labor force, particularly as business owners. However, Latina entrepreneurship has grown immensely since the start of the 21st century. In 2011, 788,000 Latinas ran their own businesses, representing a 46% increase from 2006. Comparatively, female business owners as a whole only increased by 20% during this same time period.  Family  In the United States, female employment has become an increasingly important determinant of family economic well-being, especially among disadvantaged populations such as Latinas. Female employment offers these women more autonomy, the chance to support themselves without relying on a spouse.  Domestic Abuse  This autonomy is particularly important considering some researchers believe that Latinas may be particularly vulnerable to domestic violence issues. These domestic abuse struggles result from a combination of violent partners and bureaucratic complications of the US immigration system. Domestic issues among immigrants are potentially exacerbated by language barriers, economic dependence, low levels of education and income, poor knowledge of services, undocumented status, lack of a support system, and the immigration experience in general. According to the Rutgers School of Social Work, around 17% of Latina immigrants are victims of Domestic Violence. This violence can manifest in different ways, and is often difficult to diagnose when it the result of verbal threats rather than physical abuse. Oftentimes, it is threats of deportation that influence Latina women to keep silent about their situation.  Latina Family Values and Structure  Because the Latina ethnicity encompasses a large variety of people, including people of various races from various countries, it is difficult to define the Latina Family experience in a simple way. To do so would oversimplify this population and result to stereotyping, as the experience of Latinas is just as nuanced as the women who comprise this ethnic group. There is a significant lack of literature on the home life experience of Latina women and how it may change with immigration to the United States.  Family Life in Countries of Origin  Patterns of female family structure are found to be similar in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and tend to be more matrifocal. Conversely, Mexican and Costa Rican women are often migrating from a patriarchal husband-wife system, with just 13% and 22% of households headed by women in these countries, respectively. Puerto Rico lies somewhere between these two systems, sharing aspects of both patriarchal and matrifocal systems. According to a study published by the National Institute of Health, these patterns correspond with relatively low female participation in the labor force.  Latina Power in the United States  For Mexican and Costa Rican women in particular, life in the United States represents a significant shift in opportunities for family life, as higher wages allow women the ability to be more autonomous. In a 2013 Nielson study in the United States, Latinas said they were primary or joint decision makers in the household, giving input in categories such as grocery shopping, insurance, financial services, electronics, and family care. Additionally, the Latina population is increasingly becoming \\"primary wage earners and influencers\\" in the modern Hispanic United States Household.  Education   Latina Immigrants' Current Levels of Education  The American Immigrant Council's research states that in 2012 Latina immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic had the lowest education level when compared to other countries. However, women had higher education rates than the Latino male immigrants, as shown in the American Immigration Council's chart. For example, 6.2% of female immigrants in Mexico have bachelor's degrees as compared to the 5.0% of male immigrants in 2012. 14% of the women immigrants from the Dominican Republic have bachelor's degrees compared to the 12% of Dominican men. In a recent article from the International Business Times, Latino immigrant students are falling behind in academic achievements and graduation rates compared to other students. Moreover, these statistics apply to Hispanics that have not recently migrated to the United States, implying that the American education system is not meeting the needs of Latino students as a population. The Institute for Women's Policy Research shows in a study in 2008, that Latina immigrants residing in Phoenix, Northern Virginia, and Atlanta all have a lower high school completion rates when compared to their male Latino immigrant counterparts. Latinas also fall behind Latino immigrants in their likelihood to attend 1‚Äì4 years of college. However, in Northern Virginia and Atlanta a higher percentage of Latina women complete 5+ years of college than Latino men do. Latina immigrants also lack a \\"substantial amount\\" of English proficiency, as discovered in IWPR's 2008 research. This language barrier plays a significant role in the Latina educational experience and progress.  Education Services for Latina Immigrants in the United States  Currently, there are limited resources for Latina immigrants in the United States. As explained in Motivations of Immigration, many women come to the United States for a better education, among other factors. The Institute for Women's Policy Research explains the workings of organizations aimed to support the struggles of Latina immigrants. The IWPR states that growing organizations are currently providing English tutors and access to education. Programs specifically for Latina (and Latino) immigrants now use an adaptation tactic of teaching, rather than an assimilation ideology to help this population adjust to American life. Programs like these include Casa Latina Programs, providing education on English, workers' rights, and the consumer culture of America.  Social Issues  While Latina women face a multitude of issues in immigrating into the United States, perhaps the most significant ones revolve around basic human rights. All too often, illegal Latina immigrants are unable to avoid human abuse because of lack of protection from the law. As a result, Latinas endure a severely unequal migratory experience when compared to their male counterparts. Human Trafficking Human trafficking disproportionately affects women. In the United States, an estimate of at least ten thousand people are forced into labor through such a process. Within the category of women, immigrant women are the ones who are targeted and pulled in more easily. Due to their lack of knowledge of their new surroundings, the English language, and vulnerability to work, these women are more easily tricked, or coerced, into these businesses. These women come into the United States looking for improved employment or educational opportunities, making them much more vulnerable to coercion and false job opportunities offered by traffickers. Additionally, many immigrant women do not understand their rights, or are faced with threats of deportation. Much of this trafficking is hard to detect, as it is not usually visible to the public or governmental eye. Dealing With Social Issues There are various Latina women involved in organizations and programs that aim to aid Latina women affected/victimized by human trafficking or domestic abuse. Some of these influential women include Maria Jose Fletcher, Laura Zarate, Rosie Hidalgo, Olga Trujillo, Susan Reyna. In Florida, Maria Jose Fletcher is the founder and co-director of VIDA Legal Assistance, a not-for-profit legal organization whose purpose is to provide legal support for the immigrant women who have been victims of violent crimes. This organization acknowledges and aims to solve the issue of fear of deportation that plagues the Latina community and makes it fearful of reporting such crimes. Laura Zarate is the co-founder of the organization of Arte Sana, which translates to \\"Art Heals.\\" This Latina-lead organization was founded in Austin, Texas and serves the purpose of addressing sexual violence. Rosie Hidalgo has used her position as a former attorney in New York City and her current role as the Director of Public Policy for Casa de Esperanza and the National Latin@ Network to help fight domestic violence issues. She was influential in the fight for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. She has also been awarded for her work on domestic abuse and immigration reform. Susan Reyna is the executive director of M.U.J.E.R. (Mujeres Unidas en Justicia, Educaci√≥n, y Reforma), which is an organization that provides services to farmworker families. This organization also helps victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.  Immigrant Culture within America   Mexican Influence in Literature  Immigrants have influenced today's culture in America through their practices, art, literature, and more. Latina immigrants have influenced American literature dating back to the 19th century. Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton was the first Mexican immigrant to write a novel in English. Her literary works gave Latina women in the United States a new voice by delving into race, gender, and class of the times. This set the tone for many Latino and Latina immigrants to create works in American society.  Cuban Influence in the Arts  thumb Cuban culture has made its way into America thanks to many refugees and their talents. Maria Irene Fornes, a Cuban immigrant to the United States, created plays that focused on feminism and poverty. Her success in the 1960s gave Latina immigrants a presence in off-Broadway productions. Another Cuban immigrant, Ana Mendieta, created sculptures, performances, and many other art mediums that focused on themes of women, life experiences, and earth. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009, which emphasizes her success in her artistic fields and connection to life experiences. Celia Cruz, born in Havana, Cuba, was famous for her Cuban-inspired salsa music and many Latin and American Grammy's. Celia immigrated to the US in the early 1960s against Castro's wishes. Not only was she famous for her vocals, but she made many Hollywood appearances, resulting in a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. By having such a wide, diverse audience, she left her mark on America's pop culture as a female Cuban immigrant. Like Celia, Gloria Estefan was born in Cuba and is arguably the most famous Cuban American singer to date. Her Latin music flooded American radio stations and television features, bringing Latina presence into American pop culture.

The main deity residing in the temple is the Seto Machindranath also known as Janabaha Dyo, Aryavalokitesvara, Karunamaya. Historical Background Janabahal originally was known as ‚ÄúKanak Chaitya Mahavihar‚Äù, but after deity of Seto Machindranath was mounted here the courtyard began to be referred as Jahabaha:. The name Kanak Chaitya Mahavihar is from a chaitya of Kanakmuni Buddha in front of the temple, situated in the courtyard. From this we can assume that the bahal was originally a place for Buddhists religious activities. It is said that Janabahaa: Dyo: dates back to 4th century BC but the temple at Janabahal was built by King Yaksha Malla in 1502 AD. It is also believed that kings who followed Buddhism erected the image of various Lokeswaras inside the courtyard. Major Cultural Activities Beside the main Jana Baha Dyah Jatra (chariot festival), the people, mostly Buddhists, visit and pray the Seto Machindranath deity. They count the beads tied in the thread or rotate the manes on the process of praying. Newar Buddhists perform uposadhavrata (a kind of fasting) every Ashtami by doing saptavidhanutara satvapuja and by offering pate (parasol). They also perform satpuja during which, toncha, batti, prasad all is offered in equal quantity of 1000. In the premises of Kanak-Muni Buddha‚Äüs chaitya, Barey Chwiu is done for the young males of Shakya,Buddhacharya and Bajracharya caste. Newars often organizes the program of lighting the palas around the temple or lighting 108 diyos. This shrine is mainly visited on the day of Purnima, Ashtami and Sanhu (Sankranti) by the Hindus.

There is one described species in the genus, Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri. History and classification Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri was described from a solitary fossil, which is a compression- impression fossil preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the E. biesmeijeri specimen was collected from layers of the Middle Eocene Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation. The formation is a group of Late Paleocene to Late Eocene depositional basins in Wyoming and Utah. The Parachute Creek Member is a composed of oil shales from a shallow mountain lake that existed for around 20 million years. Study of the paleoflora preserved in the shales indicates the lake was around in elevation surrounded by a tropical to subtropical environment that had a distinct dry season. At the time of study, the holotype was part of the Division of Entomology (Paleoentomology) collections, University of Kansas Natural History Museum. It was first studied by an international team of researchers headed by Manuel Dehon of the University of Mons, Belgium, with the teams 2014 type description of the genus and species was published in the natural sciences journal PLOS ONE. The genus name is a derived from a combination of the Euglossini type genus Euglossa combined with the Greek \\"pteryx\\" meaning wing. This is a reference to the similarity between Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri and species of Euglossa. The specific epithet biesmeijeri was coined as a patronym honoring the Belgian melittologist Jacobus Biesmeijer, who is a noted researcher of pollinator-plant interactions and pollinator declines. The body and wing structuring indicate a relationship to members of the bee clade Corbiculata, which encompasses the living tribes Apini, Bombini, Euglossini, Meliponini and the extinct tribes Melikertini, Electrapini, and Electrobombini. The preserved pollen basket on the metatibia excluded placement of E. biesmeijeri into a cleptoparasitic Cuckoo bee genus. Within Corbiculata, Apini has a distinct wing marginal cell and Meliponini has very reduced wing venation, neither features seen in E. biesmeijeri. The wing venation of the species is closest to that seen in Euglossini, however the metatibia is not highly expanded as seen in Euglossini. As such Dehon et al did not give any placement in the clade, leaving Euglossopteryx as Corbiculata incertae sedis. E. biesmeijeri is one of four bee species described by Dehon and team in the PLOS ONE article, the others being Andrena antoinei, Bombus cerdanyensis, and Protohabropoda pauli. Description The E. biesmeijeri fossil is a female preserved with a dorsal view of the body, out stretched wings, and missing its head. The overall body length is not determinable due to slight curling of the body and the missing head, though the mesosoma is . The metatibia are about long, not flared and enlarged notably, and with a distinct corbiculate pollen basket formed of a fringe of long setae. The original coloration and color pattering has been lost, so color pattern and if the color was metallic as in Euglossini species. The forewings have a one marginal cell and three cells below that called the submarginal cells. The marginal cell had a closed tip end that is notably rounded. The second and third submarginal cells together are longer than the first submarginal cell, which is the longest of the three cells. A pterostigma is present, but it incompletely preserved making observations difficult.

Career  Metjen's tomb inscriptions are of the highest interest to Egyptologists and historians alike. They are in fact the very first Ancient Egyptian private texts that reveal more than only titles and offering formulae. Metjen is the first high official who reports his own professional and curatorial career by listing his official and honorary titles in chronological order and describing the support of his career by his parents. According to Metjen's autobiography, he inherited many of his titles after the death of his father, other high ranked titles were assigned to him by his father himself. The inheritance included also several decrees which allowed Metjen to found his own estates and even small towns. Metjen started as a royal scribe, then became overseer of the royal scribes and confidant of the king, then he became administrator of several palatinates and royal storages. Finally, he became \\"great one of the 'Ten of Upper Egypt'\\" and privy council. Additionally, the royal house gave several estates to Metjen, whereupon he founded the town Sheret-Metjen (Egyptian: ≈†r.t-M·πØn) at his favorite estate. As a sign of gratitude, Metjen in turn donated hundreds of precious trees to royal domains. At the peak of his career, Metjen was also mayor of several cities, curator of the endowment estate of king Huni and supervisor of the mortuary cult for queen Nimaathapi.

Early life and education  Akhavan grew up in a house in Bermondsey, South London where there was an outdoor toilet and a tin bath. of postdoctoral research, she decided that her future lay in academia. She was then advised against going directly into a university career. She was instead told by her PhD advisor to go into the industry, as experience in industry would help her gain an understanding of the commercial environment. This advice helped her move back into academia once she decided to become a lecturer. After graduating, she began working at Pirelli General developing polymeric optical fibers for communication. She worked at Pirelli for 3 years when she went back into academia by joining Cranfield University as a polymer and physical chemistry lecturer. She also received her master's degree in Philosophy in 1982 and her PhD in polymer chemistry from Southampton University. Academic career At Cranfield, she first started her work using the explosives in fireworks by understanding the reactions taking place as well as making them safe for the public to use. Eventually, she was promoted to senior lecturer at Cranfield and became the head of the Centre for Defense Chemistry. Her research also is focused on polymer bonded explosives and their applications. During her tenure, she has received numerous research contracts from government organization, such as the Ministry of Defense UK, and also various corporate contracts from companies such as BAe Systems and MBDA. Most of her work, however, is secret due to the nature of her work and the application of her research will never be published. In 2007, she was given a chair in explosive chemistry and is now the Head of the Center for Defense Chemistry. As of September 2014, her current research is focused on making it easier for government agencies to detect explosives during security screenings like the ones conducted at airports. The main focus of this new research is developing viable ways to detect liquid and paste explosives. Akhavan also helps to train government agencies in bomb recognition and detection to improve safety. She is both a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistryhttp://www.rsc.org/diversity/175-faces/all-faces/professor- jacqueline-akhavan-cchem-frsc and the Institute of Explosive Engineers. She is also a member of the Board of trustees for the Explosives Engineers Educational and Research Trust, where she helps to promote a safe and professional work environment for employees working with explosives.  Personal life  As a researcher, she finds her work to be both challenging and rewarding. This also extends to her teaching career as she enjoys teaching both undergraduates and postgraduates. Akhavan also states that her career has its, though exciting and gratifying, has its drawbacks. Most notably, she states that the worst aspect of her career is how it impacts her family life. Her career has forced her to spend holidays away from her family. She elaborates by stating that if not for her husband Shari's constant support and sacrifice, she may not have gotten as far in her career as she currently has. She has stated that outside of chemistry she spends most of her free time cooking in her kitchen and sitting on her couch and reading. She highly recommends that people to go into chemistry careers, but also warns them to be ready to stop viewing the world like other people and to accept chemistry as part of their everyday lives. She also advises people looking to go into careers in academia not to expect to be rich. However, she then says that this work provides a strong sense of fulfillment and achievement. As she puts it, it is a way of life.  Notable Quotes  * When asked about the ethics of worthing with Missiles, Mortars, and IEDs, she said ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make any of those but look at making the explosives inside them safer to manufacture and safer for the user.‚Äù * ‚ÄúA lot of the work we do now is about detecting liquid explosives at airports. It has changed and is [now] all about protecting the people of this country\\" * ‚ÄúYour fusing system, you would have a prime explosive in there which, generally speaking, would contain lead azide which is very sensitive. And then your main charge will be a combination of TNT, tri-nitrotoluene, with RDX.‚Äù  The Chemistry of Explosives  Akhavan published a book called The Chemistry of Explosives (). This book covered many different aspects of explosives including the classification of explosives, combustion, ignition, thermochemistry, and kinetics. Also, there is an introduction to explosives at the beginning of the book that goes of over the development of most the notable explosives used today. The book is meant to teach others about the science behind explosive compounds.

It is considered to be a part of the class of rare-earth metal hydrides. It exists in several forms, the most common being a metallic compound with formula YH2. YH2 has a face- centred cubic structure, and is a metallic compound. Under great pressure, extra hydrogen can combine to yield an insulator with a hexagonal structure, with a formula close to YH3. Hexagonal YH3 has a band gap of 2.6 eV. Under pressure of 12 GPa YH3 transforms to an intermediate state, and when the pressure increases to 22 GPa another metallic face-centred cubic phase is formed. In 1996, it was shown that the metal-insulator transition when going from YH2 to YH3 can be used to change the optical state of windows from non- transparent to transparent. This report spurred a wave of research on metal hydride-based chromogenic materials and smart windows; gasochromic windows reacting to hydrogen gas and electrochromic structures where the transparency can be regulated by applying an external voltage. When containing a substantial amount of oxygen, yttrium hydride is also found to exhibit reversible photochromic properties. This switchable optical property enables their utilization in many technological applications, such as sensors, goggles, and medical devices in addition to the smart windows. According to a research results, the strength of the photochromic response is found to decrease with increasing oxygen concentration in the film accompanied by an optical band gap widening.

Food porn often takes the form of food photography with styling that presents food provocatively, in a similar way to glamour photography or pornographic photography. History One of the earliest forms of the term can be found in an article by Alexander Cockburn, published in December 1977 in The New York Review of Books, in which Cockburn wrote, \\"True gastro-porn heightens the excitement and also the sense of the unattainable by proffering colored photographs of various completed recipes\\".Cockburn, A. (8 December 1977). \\"Gastro-Porn\\". The New York Review of Books Michael F. Jacobson used the term \\"food porn\\" in a 1979 newsletter of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.Food And Social Media ‚Äî A Complicated Relationship The term \\"food porn\\" was also used by the feminist critic Rosalind Coward in her 1984 book Female Desire, in which she wrote: > Cooking food and presenting it beautifully is an act of servitude. It is a > way of expressing affection through a gift [...] That we should aspire to > produce perfectly finished and presented food is a symbol of a willing and > enjoyable participation in servicing others. Food pornography exactly > sustains these meanings relating to the preparation of food. The kinds of > picture used always repress the process of production of a meal. They are > always beautifully lit, often touched up. (p. 103) The term \\"food porn\\" does not strictly deal with the connection between food and sexuality. In the United States, \\"food porn\\" is a term applied when \\"food manufacturers are capitalising on a backlash against low-calorie and diet foods by marketing treats that boast a high fat content and good artery- clogging potential\\". In the United Kingdom, the term became popular in the 1990s due to the TV cookery programme Two Fat Ladies, after the show's producer described the \\"pornographic joy\\" the pair took in using vast quantities of butter and cream. Connection with business Taking a picture of food became one of the norms for the younger generation in the world. Study from YPulse shows 63% of people between thirteen years old to thirty two years old posted their food picture while they are eating on social networking services. Moreover, 57% of people in the same age range posted information of the food they were eating at that time. From the percentage, food and social media are starting to connect together as trend. People using the hashtag #foodporn helps the food industry to track audiences on social networking services. Uses/community The term \\"food porn\\" has shifted throughout its first appearances. Articles mentioned food porn as early as the late 1970s. The phrase was used in a literal manner, describing food that was unhealthy for human consumption, directly comparing it to pornography. Its use then took on a new meaning, being used to describe food that was presented and prepared in a manner that was aesthetically appealing. Once the early 2000s hit, the terminology evolved into a way of documenting meals that are recognized for their presentation. This desire for food has flooded the internet, having significant effects on social media sites that provide the ability to display such as Instagram, Flickr, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The popularity of displaying food in a physically appealing manner is driven by the users that create these communities. The use of hashtags that the users of these sites have adapted to, allow food porn to connect people in a way that documents anything about the food such as, foods that reflect cultures, calories, presentation, preparation, delicious taste, and anything else that adds to the authenticity of the meal. Culture The term \\"food porn\\" refers to images of food across various social media platforms such as TV, cooking magazines, online blogs, mobile apps, websites and social media platforms. The reason why food porn is strongly connecting with popular culture is due to the fact that people are exposed to food in their everyday lives. Food porn is not specific to social media platforms and could also be part of the category on newspaper and online blog. Moreover, food porn is experienced globally. Language barriers that exist culturally can be bypassed by the usage of #foodporn. Food porn is used collectively by the online users and does not exclude or privilege one food over another.  Pornographic metaphor  Contemporary literature and cinema consistently connect food and sexuality. Scholars note historical links between eating and sex, such as male and female humans coming together throughout evolution around food and creating offspring‚Äîtwo essential needs for survival. Today, a more obvious connection exists between the physical acts of eating and having sex in popular culture. In his book Food: The Key Concepts, Warren Belasco examines this particular resonance between kitchen and bedroom in modern-day vocabulary: \\"these intensely sexualized associations between eating and loving make it difficult to adopt the asceticism implied in eating responsibly. If pastry, sugar, fat, meat, and salt are so closely tied to life‚Äôs most intimately pleasurable experiences, who would ever want to cut back on them?\\" When Alexander Cockburn defined the term \\"gastro porn\\", he used the words \\"excitement\\" and \\"unattainable\\",Cockburn, A. (8 December 1977). Gastro-Porn. The New York Review of Books implying an element of fantasy that can be seen in both food porn and \\"traditional\\" pornography. With the rise of fad diets and exercise programs in the 1980s came a similar upward trend in food-related media and development of eating disorders.Rousseau, S. (2014). Food \\"porn\\" in media. In Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics. Springer. As people continued to restrict calories, food-related media increased in popularity due to its ability to provide the consumer with a voyeuristic indulgence of their food fantasies,O'Neill, M. (1 September 2003). Food Porn.

However it was largely destroyed during the 2007 Midwest flooding, when runoff carried away everything except the arch substructure. It had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for having state-level significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated for being Minnesota's \\"most impressive\\" rural stone arch bridge, owing to its fine ashlar masonry and sizeable span. The bridge has been replaced by a modern structure. It was officially delisted from the National Register in 2016. History 1912 postcard of a similar bridge in Winona Residents of Hillsdale Township petitioned Winona County for a bridge at this location in September 1894. Initially tabled, the request was later approved and plans were drafted by county surveyor Fred H. Pickles. The project went out for contract in October 1895 and local stonemason Charles Butler‚Äîwith the lowest bid at $1,340‚Äîwas selected. The bridge was largely completed by December of that year. Bridge No. L1409 was among a concentration of rural stone arch bridges in Southeast Minnesota built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of these were built by local governments in response to the Good Roads Movement. Few, however, spanned more than . L1409 was three times that length, and with the fine masonry produced by Butler, it was comparable to the larger and more sophisticated bridges of Minnesota's urban areas. In the summer of 2007, extreme flooding in Southeast Minnesota sent torrents of water sweeping down Garvin Brook. L1409's spandrel walls and earth fill were torn away, though the stone arch was so sturdily built it held in place. However the bridge was essentially destroyed, and it has since been replaced with a modern structure.

The Bresslaus moved to Alsace, then part of Germany, when she was eleven because of a new job opportunity for her father. Her father, Harry Bresslau, began working at the University of Strasbourg and eventually became chancellor. As a result of the move, Schweitzer adopted French, becoming fluent rather quickly. In 1898, Bresslau met her future husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding.Schweitzer- Miller, Rhena. \\"Helene Schweitzer-Bresslau.\\" Association Internationale Schweitzer Lambar√©n√©, n.d. Shortly thereafter, they developed a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: to take care of others. Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did not give up her own life for his. In fact, they spent a great deal of time away from each other and maintained a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambar√©n√©, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.  Education and professional development  University of Strasbourg, where Schweitzer took courses in medieval, modern, and art history Aged 6, Bresslau attended Queen Charlotte's School. In 1890, she transferred to Lindner Girls' High School in Berlin. She began to pursue music studies at a music conservatory from 1897 to 1899. After receiving her teaching credentials in one year rather than the usual two, she worked as a teacher in England in 1902. Continuing to delve into her passion for learning, Bresslau took courses in medieval, modern, and art history at her father's university, the University of Strasbourg. In pursuit of music, she took voice and piano lessons. One area of study that interested Bresslau was nursing. She joined the Protestant Deaconess' Society on January 1, 1904 \\"to complete a course in nursing.\\"Schweitzer-Miller, Rhena, and Gustav Woytt, eds. The Albert Schweitzer-Helene Bresslau Letters 1902‚Äì1912. First Edition. Syracuse University Press, 2003. After, she was assigned to complete three months of nursing lessons in Stettin. On April 1, 1905, she took a break from nursing and went into social work. Even so, exploring another field other than nursing left her \\"eager to fill in the gaps\\" of her nursing knowledge. She changed her direction of study when she became a municipal inspector for orphans in 1905. She maintained the position from 1905 to 1909. This endeavor attributes largely to part of her own goal to improve the social sphere. However, her home's \\"Jewish atmosphere\\" widely influenced her as she was taught to \\"pay it forward.\\" Including and prior to this job, all of her endeavors were based on her own emotions and goals without Albert's influence. In one of his letters, he notes \\"it is you who have won, happy to have found a task that will fill your life, and you‚Äôve done it ahead of me\\", addressing her social work in Strasbourg's City Orphan Administration. On October 1, 1909, Schweitzer \\"enrolled as a student in the nursing school of the Protestant Deaconess' Society in Frankfurt in the city hospital\\" to further her knowledge in the profession, thus beginning her nursing career.  Missionary work   Journey with Albert Schweitzer  The Ogoou√© River flowing past Lambar√©n√© Schweitzer and Albert shared one main common goal: to help improve medicine and the greater good in Lambar√©n√©, Gabon. At the very beginning of their journey, Schweitzer wrote in her diary that \\"we are truly in love with Africa.\\" In spring 1913, Schweitzer and Albert set off to establish a hospital (Albert Schweitzer Hospital) near an already existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft) upstream from the mouth of the Ogoou√© at Port Gentil (Cape Lopez) (and so accessible to external communications) but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambar√©n√©. The catchment area of the Ogoo√© occupies most of Gabon. Lambar√©n√© is marked. This journey to make medical improvements in Africa allowed Schweitzer to further develop herself. Patti Marxsen writes that Schweitzer's \\"capacity for hard work in a challenging environment can be read as proof that her independence earned in Strasbourg was now unshakeable. For the now thirty-four-year-old Helene Schweitzer...a life in Africa offered a chance to integrate multiple aspects of modern identity, perhaps even more so than would have been possible in Europe.\\" Schweitzer had prior interest in nursing and the medical field before Albert became involved in medicine. Therefore, Schweitzer played a vital role in his work, acting as a possible influence. In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and helped with the hospital. She played an essential part in sanitation efforts, especially by preparing medical equipment for surgery. Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations.Schweitzer, Albert. The Primeval Forest. Johns Hopkins Paperbacks Edition. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998.  Challenges  When World War I broke out in summer of 1914, the French military put Schweitzer and Albert, Germans in a French colony, under supervision at Lambar√©n√©, where they continued their work. In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical anaemia, they were taken to Bordeaux and interned first in Garaison and then from March 1918 in Saint-R√©my-de- Provence. The Schweitzer house and Museum at K√∂nigsfeld in the Black Forest Medical issues forced Schweitzer to leave Africa many times, and sometimes Albert kept her from returning at times. When Albert decided to return to Africa in 1924, he took on an Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambar√©n√© due to her health. In 1923 the family moved to K√∂nigsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum. Schweitzer's house at Gunsbach, now a museum and archive Albert Schweitzer Memorial and Museum in Weimar (1984) Her not returning to Lambar√©n√© was a sacrifice made \\"by her husband, not for him.\\" She wrote about her not returning, describing it as a \\"practical matter\\", but she \\"never agreed to a separation of three and a half years\\" from her husband. Despite her poor health, she still took care of her daughter, \\"engage[d] herself with the Hospital Aid Association,\\" and \\"enroll[ed] in a three-week course in tropical medicine at the Medical Missionary Institute of T√ºbingen, Germany.\\" As a motherhood advocate, she gladly took care of her daughter and continued to develop her own personal skills. Schweitzer still remained engaged in helping the mission hospital. In 1929, after receiving treatment for pneumonia, Schweitzer returned to Lambar√©n√© to see her husband Albert's progression with the new hospital. Shortly after arriving, however, she developed a bad fever and was forced to depart the hospital and her husband to return to Europe for treatment. After recovering, she used her writing skills and began to edit her husband's autobiography. Her English skills also opened the door for \\"public speaking and networking in the United States.\\" On December 1, 1930, a German newspaper printed one of her speeches. In it, she described her husband's concept, the Fellowship of the Marks of Pain. She turned her medical challenges into positives, explaining that through her suffering she developed a compassionate view of their work that only she could personally attest. Schweitzer was aware that her husband would receive much of the acclaim for their missionary endeavors, so she set out to make her work known. In October 1946, she began to review her documents and collect them so that she would be understood as a \\"full partner\\" in their missionary work. In addition, she began lecture tours in the United States in 1937 to promote the Schweitzer Hospital.  Health complications  Schweitzer experienced tremendous health issues throughout her life, mostly in relation to her lungs. She first encountered tuberculosis before she turned ten. She was officially diagnosed in the spring of 1922 with laryngeal tuberculosis after exhibiting symptoms of \\"pain, fever, and coughing up blood.\\" In addition, the heat of Africa caused many respiratory issues. In 1915, she contracted phlebitis resulting in two weeks of therapeutic bed rest. She also had pneumonia in 1929, almost keeping her from returning to Lambar√©n√©. Despite her already weak lungs, she completed the trip, though she had to return early due to illness again. Albert's tomb at a hospital in Lambar√©n√© Schweitzer died on June 1, 1957, and her remains are located in Lambar√©n√©. When Albert died, he was buried next to her. Schweitzer's grave with Albert lies on the banks of the Ogooue River, marked by a cross he made himself.Reuters. \\"Albert Schweitzer, 90, Dies at His Hospital\\" (September 6, 1965): n. pag. The New York Times Learning Network. New York Times. Web. December 5, 2015.  Legacy  Schweitzer contributed greatly to the work done in Lambar√©n√©. A role model as an independent, educated woman with a deep intellectual curiosity, she was \\"One of the first female students at the University of Strasbourg\\" and \\"One of the first female employees in the community administration\\" at the orphanage. Her aid in the poor relief system, \\"Armenpflegesystem,\\" mirrored in modern social welfare, saw the illegitimate mortality rate fall. Setting precedence as a female medical missionary in the early 20th century, she established lasting effects of nursing and education in Lambar√©n√©. She co-founded the Schweitzer Hospital, documented much of Albert's autobiography, and \\"supported the [mission] work with lectures and fund-raising\\" essential to its upkeep and vivacity.

Derk Bodde (1961) stated that \\"from all mythological themes in ancient Chinese, the earliest and so far most pervasive is about flood.\\" The mythology also has shared characteristics with other Great Floods all over the world, although it also has unique characteristics or different focuses. Lu Yilu (2002) groups all versions of great flood into three themes: \\"the heroes controls the flood; \\"brother-sister marriage to repopulating the world\\"; and \\"the flood which is drowning the whole city along with its citizens\\". History and mythology Literary history The history of China as a continuously recorded literary tradition begins with the ancient documents transmitted to posterity through the Records of the Grand Historian. According to these, the great-grandson (or fourth successor) of the Yellow Emperor was Yao. Beginning with the reign of Yao, additional literary sources become available, including the Book of Documents (collected and edited by Confucius), which begins with the \\"Canon of Yao\\" (), describing the events of Yao's reign.Wu, 65 Although, the \\"Canon of Yao\\" is problematic in regards to textual transmission (at best it seems to represent an early textual reconstruction and at worst a fabrication based on available knowledge or sources from the 3rd or 4th centuries CE). \\"The Counsels of Great Yu\\" is considered to be one of the reliably transmitted pre-Qin texts. In any case, these and other texts of the preserved literature mark the beginnings of the Chinese historical tradition. Other important texts include the poem Heavenly Questions collected in the Chu Ci which is attributed to Qu Yuan and the famous mythological compendium Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing). Furthermore, centuries of scholarship have gone into piecing together a narrative from the bits, pieces, and occasionally longer sections found in these and other early sources, sometimes being subjected to heavy editorial handling in terms of viewpoint. Collected mythology Mythological stories besides having been preserved both in various literary forms, have also been collected from various oral traditions, some of these folktales are still told. Some of these sources are from people of the Han ethnicity and some from other ethnic groups. The struggles to control the flood The Zhou sources narrated the struggles of the heroes or deities to control the floods. From all of these stories, the struggle of Yao, Gun, and Yu is the most obvious in describing the hardness of human effort to control the flood. Much later works from the Warring States period (Shiben) and Diwang Shiji (3rd century) were pairing Yu and Nuwa as a couple and their previously uncorrelated stories were then completing each other. Gun-Yu Mythology This theme is based on the efforts of Great Yu (and Gun) to control the flood, sometimes is also associated with Emperor Yao and Shun, and the initial efforts of human to domesticated wild animals as pack animals and livestock. The theme outline narrates Gun stole xirang to stop the flood while Great Yu channeled the flood into the sea and succeeded to subsided the water level, and so the earth can be cultivated. There are so many mythologies which are correlated to this theme, one of which is \\"Dragon Gate\\" -a canal through the mountains which was dug by Yu. While he was digging the canal, many of the carps were swept away and fell, they were so disappointed because they couldn't swim back into the upper level. Yu promised them, if any of the carp could leap through his dam, it would transform into a dragon, thus the place inherited its name. Gun-Yu theme is also have political background. Huainanzi stated that the great flood was caused by Gong Gong who was use the water to make havoc on the realm of Emperor Yao. Shan Hai Jing narrated another version that the flood was caused by Xiangliu, one of Gong Gong's minister, and was not Gong Gong himself. Nuwa repaired the heaven The story happened after Goddess N√ºwa created (molded) humanity from yellow clay, brought them into life, and gave them the ability to reproduce. Gonggong was banging his head into Mount Buzhou, which actually was the pillar to support the heaven. N√ºwa then patched the sky with five-colored pebbles and piled up reeds ashes to stop the flood. The extinction of human race Chen Jianxian (1996) said that this theme was one of some popular legends which was still being told by more than 40 ethnics in China. There is a possibility that the myth is rather new because the oldest recorded sources about this myth were from Six Dynasties, save that the oral tradition maybe much older. The theme was made into several versions, but the outline is about a great flood which was destroyed all the humans all over the world except a pair of brother and sister, or aunt and nephew. Both were forced to married in order to repopulated the world. One version stated that their children were ordinary humans, while the others said it was a lump of meat, squash, melon, or grindstone; after they opened, cut, or destroyed it, humans emerged. Sinking city This theme have some specific characteristics: one or two people were survived, the statue which was crying blood, and the whole city along with its citizens were sinking. The survivor(s) was being saved by the gods because of his/her benevolent acts; may be an old lady or a devoted son. The blood crying statue was often a stone lion statue, or sometimes tortoise statue. Other flood myths East Sea and Mulberry Field A less widespread flood myth involves the goddess Magu: this myth involves the cyclic rise and fall of the ocean level over the eons: sometimes the sea floor is under water; at other times, it turns into mulberry fields. However, the material about Magu seems to be distinct from the idea of a great flood upon the land of China. One tradition narrates Magu, a benevolent Taoist lady who lived on the second century. She was reclaiming a very wide seashore water bodies on Kiangsu and changing it into mulberry fields. Heyu Shan Hai Jing mentions a pig-like creature with human face, yellow-colored and red-tailed, and it sounds like human singing. The creature is known as Heyu; it preys on human, reptiles, and snakes. It appearance is a sign that there will be a great deluge all over the world.

She began as a community organizer and worked her way up to the labor division, finally becoming head of the Industrial Division from 1937 to 1947. At the end of World War II, when women were phased out of the labor market, she was briefly dismissed, but then hired back to organize support for the communities springing up around the defense industry. Biography Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver was born on June 15, 1896 in Marion, Virginia to Laura Lu (n√©e Scherer) and Bascom Eugene Copenhaver. Both of Copenhaver's parents taught at the school her grandfather Scherer had founded, Marion Female College. She spent her childhood at the family home, \\"Rosemont\\", which also housed Rosemont Industries, an organization established by her mother, which marketed local handicrafts. After completing her primary education at the public schools of Marion, Copenhaver began her university studies at Marion College before she transferred in 1914 to Westhampton College in Richmond, Virginia. She completed her B.A. in English in 1917 and returned that same year to Marion to teach. In 1918, she enrolled in social work classes at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and in 1919 worked in a settlement camp for New York City women during the summer. She completed her degree in 1920 earning a certificate in social economy. Career In September 1920, Copenhaver became a Field Secretary on the national staff of the YWCA covering the south and central region. From 1920 to 1923 she was a rural community organizer. In addition to introducing the programs of the YWCA to local communities and churches, Copenhaver participated in seminars and retreats like one held in 1922, which explored the tenets of internationalism that had sprung up after the first World War. The YWCA believed that if women used their moral and professional authority, they would reshape the world. Copenhaver participated in the \\"Conference at the Lake\\" and after their presentation on relationships with Syrian and Japanese women, and the Bible study, she directed a play, which she had written with her mother. The basic theme was modernity and the enlightenment of women who could draw upon the past, their spirituality and their ability to work and use their intelligence. In 1923 she switched to industrial community activism then in 1925 became the National Industrial Secretary working out of New York. Her political beliefs became increasingly radical during her many visits to factories to counsel and organize working women. During one of these visits in 1928, she made a side trip to her family and met the writer Sherwood Anderson. Coperhaver returned to New York and enrolled in a master's program at Columbia University. She completed the degree in political economy in 1933 and later that same year, married Anderson. Coperhaver-Anderson continued working as a labor organizer. In 1937, she was promoted to head the Industrial Programs of the YWCA. Her work entailed investigating working and educational conditions, submitting reports for action and providing support for labor unions. She continued to travel with her job and the couple also traveled to visit Sherwood's artist and writer friends all over the world. On one of these trips, taken in 1941 after the death of her mother, the couple were en route to Valparaiso, Chile aboard the SS Santa Lucia. Sherwood became ill with peritonitis, the couple disembarked, but he died at a hospital in Col√≥n, Panama. After bringing him back to Virginia for burial, Anderson returned to work. She continued as the executive of the Y's industrial division and resumed her travels, going across the country, until the Industrial Department was phased out soon after the end of World War II. When that happened, in 1947, Anderson took a two-year assignment with the international YWCA in Italy to help with relief efforts. At the end of her assignment, she returned from Italy and was terminated by the Y due to their elimination of women's employment programs. She spent most of 1950 organizing Sherwood's papers and preparing them for donation to the Newberry Library in Chicago. The following year, she was rehired by the YWCA working on their United Community Defense Services, which was a program aimed at providing \\"health, welfare, and recreation services\\" to communities supporting the defense industry. She remained with the YWCA until her retirement in 1961. After her retirement, she served as Sherwood's literary executor as well as the overseer of his property at \\"Ripshin\\" and her mother's legacy at \\"Rosemont\\". Anderson died on September 12, 1985 in Marion, Virginia. Copenhaver's papers are located at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Many of the records can be found on-line as part of the Five College Finding Aids Access Project, which was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

The camera pose consists of 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) which are made up of the rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw) and 3D translation of the camera with respect to the world. This problem originates from camera calibration and has many applications in computer vision and other areas, including 3D pose estimation, robotics and augmented reality. A commonly used solution to the problem exists for called P3P, and many solutions are available for the general case of . A solution for exists if feature orientations are available at the two points. Implementations of these solutions are also available in open source software.  Problem Specification   Definition  Given a set of 3D points in a world reference frame and their corresponding 2D image projections as well as the calibrated intrinsic camera parameters, determine the 6 DOF pose of the camera in the form of its rotation and translation with respect to the world. This follows the perspective project model for cameras: : s\\\\,p_c = K\\\\,[\\\\,R\\\\, |\\\\, T\\\\, ]\\\\, p_w . where \\\\textstyle p_w = \\\\begin{bmatrix}x & y & z & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}^T is the homogeneous world point, \\\\textstyle p_c = \\\\begin{bmatrix}u & v & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}^T is the corresponding homogeneous image point, \\\\textstyle K is the matrix of intrinsic camera parameters, (where \\\\textstyle f_x and f_y are the scaled focal lengths, \\\\textstyle \\\\gamma is the skew parameter which is sometimes assumed to be 0, and \\\\textstyle (u_0,\\\\, v_0) is the principal point), \\\\textstyle s is a scale factor for the image point, and \\\\textstyle R and \\\\textstyle T are the desired 3D rotation and 3D translation of the camera (extrinsic parameters) that are being calculated. This leads to the following equation for the model: : s\\\\begin{bmatrix}u\\\\\\\\\\\\v\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_x & \\\\gamma & u_0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & f_y & v_0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_{1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_{3}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\\\\\\\\\y\\\\\\\\\\\\z\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{bmatrix} .  Assumptions and Data Characteristics  There are a few preliminary aspects of the problem that are common to all solutions of PnP. The assumption made in most solutions is that the camera is already calibrated. Thus, its intrinsic properties are already known, such as the focal length, principal image point, skew parameter, and other parameters. Some methods, such as UPnP. or the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) applied to the projection model, are exceptions to this assumption as they estimate these intrinsic parameters as well as the extrinsic parameters which make up the pose of the camera that the original PnP problem is trying to find. For each solution to PnP, the chosen point correspondences cannot be colinear. In addition, PnP can have multiple solutions, and choosing a particular solution would require post-processing of the solution set. RANSAC is also commonly used with a PnP method to make the solution robust to outliers in the set of point correspondences. P3P methods assume that the data is noise free, most PnP methods assume Gaussian noise on the inlier set.  Methods  This following section describes two common methods that can be used to solve the PnP problem that are also readily available in open source software and how RANSAC can be used to deal with outliers in the data set.  P3P  When , the PnP problem is in its minimal form of P3P and can be solved with three point correspondences. However, with just three point correspondences, P3P yields up to four real, geometrically feasible solutions. For low noise levels a fourth correspondence can be used to remove ambiguity. The setup for the problem is as follows. Let P be the center of projection for the camera, A, B, and C be 3D world points with corresponding images points u, v, and w. Let X = |PA|, Y = |PB|, Z = |PC|, \\\\alpha = \\\\angle BPC, \\\\beta = \\\\angle APC, \\\\gamma = \\\\angle APB, p = 2\\\\cos\\\\alpha, q = 2\\\\cos\\\\beta, r = 2\\\\cos\\\\gamma, a' = |AB|, b' = |BC|, c' = |AC|. This forms triangles PBC, PAC, and PAB from which we obtain a sufficient equation system for P3P: : \\\\begin{cases} Y^2 + Z^2 - YZp - b'^2 &= 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z^2 + X^2 - XZq - c'^2 &= 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ X^2 + Y^2 - XYr - a'^2 &= 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} . Solving the P3P system results in up to four geometrically feasible real solutions for and . The oldest published solution dates to 1841. A recent algorithm for solving the problem as well as a solution classification for it is given in the 2003 IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence paper by Gao, et al. An open source implementation of Gao's P3P solver can be found in OpenCV's calib3d module in the solvePnP function. Several faster and more accurate versions have been published since, including Lambda Twist P3P which achieved state of the art performance in 2018 with a 50 fold increase in speed and a 400 fold decrease in numerical failures. Lambdatwist is available as open source in OpenMVG and at https://github.com/midjji/pnp.  EPnP  Efficient PnP (EPnP) is a method developed by Lepetit, et al. in their 2008 International Journal of Computer Vision paper that solves the general problem of PnP for . This method is based on the notion that each of the n points (which are called reference points) can be expressed as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. Thus, the coordinates of these control points become the unknowns of the problem. It is from these control points that the final pose of the camera is solved for. As an overview of the process, first note that each of the reference points in the world frame, p^w_i, and their corresponding image points, p^c_i, are weighted sums of the four controls points, c^w_j and c^c_j respectively, and the weights are normalized per reference point as shown below. All points are expressed in homogeneous form. :p^w_i = \\\\sum^4_{j=1}{\\\\alpha_{ij}c^w_j} :p^c_i = \\\\sum^4_{j=1}{\\\\alpha_{ij}c^c_j} :\\\\sum^4_{j=1}{\\\\alpha_{ij}} = 1 From this, the derivation of the image reference points becomes :s_i\\\\,p^c_i = K\\\\sum^4_{j=1}{\\\\alpha_{ij}c^c_j}. The homogeneous image control point has the form \\\\textstyle c^c_j = \\\\begin{bmatrix}x^c_j & y^c_j & z^c_j\\\\end{bmatrix}^T. Rearranging the image reference point equation yields the following two linear equations for each reference point: : \\\\sum^4_{j=1}{\\\\alpha_{ij}f_xx^c_j + \\\\alpha_{ij}(u_0 - u_i)z^c_j} = 0 : \\\\sum^4_{j=1}{\\\\alpha_{ij}f_yy^c_j + \\\\alpha_{ij}(v_0 - v_i)z^c_j} = 0 . Using these two equations for each of the reference points, the system \\\\textstyle Mx = 0 can be formed where \\\\textstyle x = \\\\begin{bmatrix}c^{c^T}_1 & c^{c^T}_2 & c^{c^T}_3 & c^{c^T}_4\\\\end{bmatrix}^T. The solution for the control points exists in the null space of and is expressed as :x = \\\\sum^N_{i=1}{\\\\beta_iv_i} where N is the number of null singular values in M and each v_i is the corresponding right singular vector of M. N can range from 0 to 4. After calculating the initial coefficients \\\\beta_i, the Gauss-Newton algorithm is used to refine them. The and matrices that minimize the reprojection error of the world reference points, p^w_i, and their corresponding actual image points p^c_i, are then calculated. This solution has O(n) complexity and works in the general case of PnP for both planar and non-planar control points. Open source software implementations of this method can be found in OpenCV's Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction module in the solvePnP function as well as from the code published by Lepetit, et al. at their website, CVLAB at EPFL. This method is not robust against outliers and generally compares poorly to RANSAC P3P followed by nonlinear refinement.  Using RANSAC  PnP is prone to errors if there are outliers in the set of point correspondences. Thus, RANSAC can be used in conjunction with existing solutions to make the final solution for the camera pose more robust to outliers. An open source implementation of PnP methods with RANSAC can be found in OpenCV's Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction module in the solvePnPRansac function.

Gene expression has been commonly characterized as a measure of how much, how fast, when and where this process happens. Promoters and enhancers are required for controlling where and when a specific gene is transcribed. Traditionally the measure of gene products (i.e. mRNA, proteins, etc.) has been the major approach of measure promoter activity. However, this method confront with two issues: the stochastic nature of the gene expression and the lack of mechanistic interpretation of the thermodynamical process involve in the promoter activation. The actual developments in metabolomics product of developments of next-generation sequencing technologies and molecular structural analysis have enabled the development of more accurate models of the process of promoter activation (e.g. the sigma structure of the polymerase holoenzyme domains) and a better understanding of the complexities of the regulatory factors involved.  Promoter binding  Probability of binding for the T7 (green) and Lac Ecoli (blue) promoters by RNA polymerase concentrations.The process of binding is central in determining the \\"strength\\" of promoters, that is the relative estimation of how \\"well\\" a promoter perform the expression of a gene under specific circumstances. Brewster et al., using a simple thermodynamical model based on the postulate that transcriptional activity is proportional to the probability of finding the RNA polymerase bound at the promoter, obtained predictions of the scaling of the RNA polymerase binding energy. This models support the relationship between the probability of binding and the output of gene expression Mathematical representation of promoter binding  The problem of gene regulation could be represented mathematically as the probability of n molecules ‚Äî RNAP, activators, repressors and inducers ‚Äî are bound to a target regions. To compute the probability of bound, it is needed to sum the Boltzmann weights over all possible states of P polymerase molecules on DNA. Here in this deduction P is the effective number of RNAP molecules available for binding to the promoter. This approach is based in statistical thermodynamics of two possible microscopic outcomes: # one state where all P polymerases molecules are distributed among all the non-specific sites (sites not participating in gene expression) # a promoter occupied and the remaining P-1 polymerases distributed among the non-specific sites. The statistical weigh of promoter unoccupied Z(P) is defined: Z(P) = ~\\\\frac{N_{NS}!}{P!*(N_{NS}-P)!}* {e}^{- ~\\\\frac{E_{NS}}{KbT} } Where the first term is the combinatorial result of taken P polymerase of N_{NS} non-specific sites available, and the second term are the Boltzmann weights, where E_{NS} is the energy that represents the average binding energy of RNA polymerase to the genomic background (non-specific sites). Then, the total statistical weight Z(Ptotal), can be written as the sum of the Z(P) state and the RNA polymerase on promoter state: Z(Ptotal) = Z(P)+ Z(P-1)* {e}^{- ~\\\\frac{E_{S}}{KbT} } Where E_{S} in the Z(P-1) state is the binding energy for RNA polymerase on the promoter (where the s stands for specific site). Finally, to find the probability of a RNA polymerase to binding (Prob_{bound} ) to a specific promoter, we divide Z(P) by Z(Ptotal) which produces: Prob_{bound} = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{N_NS}{P}*{e}^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E}{KbT}}} Where, \\\\Delta E = E_{S}-E_{NS} An important result of this model is that any transcription factor, regulator or perturbation could be introduced as a term multiplying P in the probability of binding equation. This term for any transcriptional factor (here called factor regulators) modify the probability of binding to: Prob_{bound} = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{N_NS}{P*F_{R}}*{e}^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E}{KbT}}} Where F_{R} is the term for transcriptional factors, and it has the value of F_{R} >1 for increase of F_{R}<1 for decrease of the number of RNA polymerase available to bind. This result has an important significance to represent mathematically all the possible configurations of transcriptional factor by derive different models to estimate F_{R} (for further developments, see also ). Eukaryotes promoter structure Core Promoter elements. The process of activation and binding in eukaryotes is different from bacteria in the way that specific DNA elements bind the factors for a functional pre-initiation complex. In bacteria there is a single polymerase, that contain catalytic subunits and a single regulatory subunits known as sigma, which transcribe for different type of genes. In eukaryotes, the transcription is performed by three different RNA polymerase, RNA pol I for ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), RNA polymerase II for messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and some small regulatory RNAs, and the RNA polymerase III for small RNAs such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The process of positioning of the RNA polymerase II and the transcriptional machinery require the recognition of a region known as \\"core promoter\\". The elements that could be found in the core promoter include the TATA element, the TFIIB recognition element (BRE), the initiator (Inr), and the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Promoters in eukaryotes contain one or more of these core promotes elements (but any of them are absolutely essential for promoter function), these elements are binding sites for subunits of the transcriptional machinery and are involve in the initiation of the transcription, but also they have some specific enhancer functions. In addition, the promoter activity in eukaryotes include some complexities in the way of how they integrate signals from distal factors with the core promoter.  Evolutionary processes  Unlike in protein coding regions, where the assumption of sequence conservation of functionally homologous genes have been frequently proved, there is not a clear relationship of conservation between sequences and their functions for regulatory regions. The transcriptional promoters regions are under less stringent selection, then have a higher substitutions rates, allowing transcription factor binding sites to be replaced easily be new ones arising from random mutations. Notwithstanding the sequence changes, mainly the functions of regulatory sequences remain conserved. In recents years with the increase of availability of genome sequences, phylogenetic footprinting open the possibility to identify cis-elements, and then study their evolution processes. In this sense, Raijman et al., Dermitzakis et al. have developed techniques for analyzing evolutionary processes in transcription factor regions in Saccharomyces species promoters and mammalian regulatory networks respectively. The basis for many of these evolutionary changes in nature are probably related with events within the cis-regulatory regions involve in gene expression. The impact of variation in regulatory regions is important for disease risk due their impact in the gene expression level. Furthermore, perturbations in the binding properties of proteins encoded by regulatory genes have been linked with phenotypes effects such as, duplicated structures, homeotic transformations and novel morphologies.  Measure of promoter activity  The measure of the promoter activity has a broad meaning. The promoter activity could be measured for different situations or research questions, such as: * estimation of the level of expression in comparison (relative) to some known value * how fast a gene is expressed after induction * the timing of expression relative to others genes * the specific spatial location of expression Methods to study promoter activity commonly are based in the expression of a reporter gene from the promoter of the gene of interest. Mutations and deletions are made in a promoter region, and their changes on couple expression of the reporter gene are measured. The most important reporter genes are the fluorescence proteins as GFP. These reporters allow to measure promoter activation by increasing fluorescent signals, and deactivation by decrease in the rate of fluorescence.

Personal life  Lawrie was born on 8 February 1923, in Edinburgh, son of Alfred Lawrie, a stockbroker and president of the Scottish Rugby Union,newspaper clippings and photograph and Jean Maxwell Lawrie (n√©e Cook). The family lived at 5 Moray Place on the prestigious Moray Estate in west Edinburgh. His father was partner in Lawrie & Ker of 4 St Andrew Square.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1911 He and his family moved to North Berwick where he learned to play golf, winning the Elco Medal in 1937 at the children's course at North Berwick Golf Club. He won the Gold Medal at a junior tournament at Carnoustie in 1939. He was educated at Fettes and Oxford, where 'he was a cricket star'. Whilst at Oxford University he gained five \\"Blues\\" in different sports. His cousin, James Haldane Lawrie, was a businessman, financier and patron of the arts. James was Chairman of the English Opera Group, and Benjamin Britten dedicated The Beggar's Opera (1948) to him. Charles fought in World War II as a 2nd Lt. in the Coldstream Guards. As Sheriff of Anglesey, he took part in the Queen's coronation visit in 1953 in Caernarvon Castle. He died aged only 53 in his birthplace, Edinburgh. He is buried in North Berwick Cemetery. The grave lies near the south-west corner.  Playing and administrative career  Lawrie competed as an amateur in The Open Championship in 1955 and 1957. He was the non-playing captain of the Great Britain and Ireland team in the 1960 and 1962 Eisenhower Trophy, and the non-playing captain of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team in 1961 and 1963; teams which included Michael Bonallack and Joe Carr. The 1961 American team included a young Jack Nicklaus, playing well enough to ensure a dominant victory that year. It was much closer the next time the two teams met. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lawrie held various posts with the Royal & Ancient, including Chairman of the Amateur Status Committee, Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the Championship Committee, and Chairman of the Selection Committee. He was president of the National Golf Club's Advisory Association in the mid-1970s.Letter from the National Golf Club's Advisory Association, 6.12.1975 In \\"Palmer's Open\\" in 1962, Lawrie was referee for the final round pairing between Arnold Palmer and Kel Nagle. James Cusick of The Independent reports how the crowd were so fierce that year at Royal Troon that at the 15th, Lawrie was 'knocked head-first into a bunker during one of the crowd's surges'.  Golf architecture  Lawrie went on to design golf courses as a partner of the golf architecture firm \\"Cotton Pennink Lawrie & Partners\\", which designed golf courses around the world. He designed the Duke's Course (1976), the location of the British Masters for 20 years, and the Duchess' course (1978) at Woburn Golf Club.

Most recently, her ground-breaking research has focused on the prevalence and impact of adverse childhood experiences and their relationship to adult psychosocial problems and criminality. She has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, many of which have been about adverse childhood experiences and the implications for trauma- informed care.

History EMT√â supermarket Montfoort EMT√â started back in 1948 as a butcher in the city of Waalwijk in the Netherlands. The owner Mechie Trommelen was planning to open a second location in the city of Drunen, however he was inspired by two already existing companies to open a supermarket. So on March 2, 1965 he opened his first supermarket called EMT√â. It was a success so a second store was opened, this time with a liquor store in it. A third store was opened in 1973, a fourth in 1978, a fifth in 1982. This went on until EMT√â had 12 locations. In 2002 EMT√â became part of Sligro Food Group. In three years the number of locations went from 12 to 18. In 2006 EMT√â took over the Edah stores. After this the EMT√â had 82 locations and was still growing and expanding its locations. After taking over Sanders, Golff, and some locations of Spar the number of EMT√â locations grew to the current 130.  New plan  EMT√â commenced on November 11, 2015 with a new plan called 3.0. This plan puts a kitchen into the store. In this kitchen EMT√â will prepare: fresh meals, lunches, crudit√©s and fruit salads. They also bake fresh pizzas and nuts. They have also expanded their cheese section with new types of cheese. EMT√â started this formula in a store in Dieren.

The band has since signed with Solid State Records and have released two albums, The Storm Before the Calm and Voices, and a demo. History Death Therapy originated in November 2015 as a solo project in hopes to create a new outlet for Jason Wisdom to create music again. Wisdom previously had performed with Christian metal band Becoming the Archetype as well as technical death metal project Solamors with former BTA and Aletheian members. The concept for the band began in 2010, but did not officially begin until 2015. Wisdom hired his friend Brian Wages to perform Keyboards for the project, while the two programmed the drums on the band's first three songs - \\"Possessed\\", \\"The Lie\\", and \\"Prodigal\\" - which eventually came out as a demo, titled Demo Songs - 2015/2016, which was released independently on February 24, 2016. On October 30, 2016, the band announced that they had signed with Solid State Records, which oddly enough the label did not announce until January 19, 2017. Following their signing with the label, the band released two singles, \\"Self Mind Dead\\" and \\"Slow Dance (With Death)\\", to promote their upcoming album. The band released their debut, The Storm Before the Calm, through Solid State on February 24, 2017. The project toured around with several acts throughout 2017 and 2018. Death Therapy also released a cover, \\"Crazy\\" of Gnarls Barkley, as a stream. Following the cover's release, the band announced their sophomore album, Voices. Voices debuted through Solid State on April 12, 2019.

Inspired by effective altruism, the mission of Founders Pledge is to ‚Äúempower entrepreneurs to do immense good‚Äù. By the end of 2019, around 1300 entrepreneurs across 26 countries have signed up to Founders Pledge. Collectively, they have pledged to donate $2 billion in share value, and about $370 million in donations have been completed to date. History Founders Pledge was initially launched in 2015 by the Founders Forum for Good, which focuses on helping social entrepreneurs build and scale businesses. David Goldberg, co-founder and CEO of Founders Pledge, says that the ideas of effective altruism, earning to give, and the work of 80,000 Hours in particular, was influential to his thinking and his decision to set up Founders Pledge. Founders Pledge was named one of the New Radicals 2016, which are ‚Äúinnovative projects chosen by The Observer and Nesta as making a real difference to society‚Äù. Starting in London, Founders Pledge has since expanded and opened multiple new offices in cities such as Berlin, New York and San Francisco. In addition, Founders Pledge has launched partnerships with organisations including Y Combinator, MassChallenge, and Forward Partners. In September 2016, Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, wrote on the Y Combinator blog: \\"Many of our founders ask us about how they can donate part of their equity or post exit proceeds, and now we have an answer: Founders Pledge.\\" Since 2016, Founders Pledge was awarded two major grants‚Å†‚Äîtotaling more than $6 million‚Å†‚Äîfrom the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation largely funded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.  Activities  Founders Pledge runs three main types of activities, all of which are free of charge for its members. First, they aim to build a community of impact-driven entrepreneurs by organising events to educate members on evidence-backed impact strategies. Second, they provide administrative support with donations and offer a donor-advised fund. Third, Founders Pledge conducts research into high-leverage giving opportunities and advises its members on where to give based on their personal values. Founders Pledge partners with GiveWell for its research on cost-effective global health and development charities. In addition, Founders Pledge has written research reports on various topics, including impact investing, climate change , evidence-based policy, animal welfare, mental health, and the mitigation of existential risks. Members Entrepreneurs signing up to Founders Pledge enter a legally binding commitment to donate a portion of their personal proceeds on liquidity to charity. The minimum commitment is 2%, though on average entrepreneurs commit around 7%. Comparing several donation pledging initiatives, Vox writes that Founders Pledge forces The Giving Pledge ‚Äúto compete for the mindshare of today‚Äôs tech community‚Äù. A complete list of members is available on the Founders Pledge website.

Alaton is known as one of the biggest influences on the Californian residential interiors in the 1980s.  Career  Born on May 14, 1940 in Turkey, Alaton originally intended on becoming an artist and while studying art in Paris at age 16, he switched his focus to interior design. While studying design he worked under Russian designer Oscar Mourinsky. Alaton later moved to Los Angeles, California where he quickly became a designer. He was known for giving new life to antique pieces by incorporating them into his otherwise modern designs. Alaton can best be linked to the Modernism design movement that lasted from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. Alaton has designed interiors such as a triplex in West Hollywood that were homes to Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra, as well as homes in Beverly Hills such as Simon and Serlee Beriro's residence. His specialty was residential design, and focused on the needs of the client. His inspiration was the client and had them thoroughly involved in the design process. Alaton was also the mentor of interior designer Marjorie Shushan, who credits him as \\"the designer who changed my life. He taught me to be curious and always open to new ideas.\\" She worked under him for 10 years before opening her own firm in New York City. Alaton was named one of the top 20 greatest designers of all time in 2010 by Architectural Digest and listed in the Interior Hall of Fame in 2014.  Death  Alaton died on May 15, 1989 due to AIDS complications and is survived by his life partner Ralf Webb.

It was first published in the 11th issue of the Krasnaya Nov literary magazine in 1936 and later the same year as a part of the collection Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals. It was later released as a part of The Malachite Casket collection. The story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams in 1944, and by Eve Manning in the 1950s. In this skaz, two boys meet the legendary creature the Great Snake (also translated as Poloz the Great Snake; ). The story of two brothers is then continued in \\"The Snake Trail\\", published in 1939.  Publication  This skaz was first published together with \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" and \\"Beloved Name\\" (also known as \\"That Dear Name\\") in the 11th issue of Krasnaya Nov in 1936. \\"Beloved Name\\" was published on the pages 5‚Äì9, \\"The Great Snake\\" on pp. 9‚Äì12, and \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" on pp. 12‚Äì17.Bazhov 1952, p. 240. These tales are the ones that follow the original Ural miners' folklore most closely.Bazhov 1952, p. 241. They were included in the collection Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals (), released later the same year by Sverdlovsk Publishing House. It was later released as a part of The Malachite Casket collection on 28 January 1939. In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson as a part of The Malachite Casket: Tales from the Urals collection. The title was translated as \\"The Great Snake\\".Bazhov 1944, p. 106. In the 1950s another translation of The Malachite Casket was made by Eve Manning The story was published as \\"The Great Serpent\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 9.  Sources  Poloz () is the word for the snakes from the Colubridae family.Dictionary of the Russian Language (Ozhegov) The character of Poloz the Great Snake is based the Ural legends, miner's omens, and on the superstitions of the Khanty, the Mansi people, and the Bashkirs. The legends about Poloz, a giant serpent 6‚Äì10 meters long, still exist at the Urals.Shvabauer 2009, p. 58.Blazhes 1983, p. 15.Blazhes 1983, p. 17. In the Bashkir folklore there is the character the Master of Gold, which can appear as various animals, including the snake.Shvabauer 2009, p. 120. At the Urals he is also called The Serpent or The Snake King (–ó–º–µ–∏–Ω—ã–π —Ü–∞—Ä—å, Zmeinyj tsar). It is believed that the grass turns yellow where he touches the surface. Poloz and the snake trails in general indicate the location of gold.Blazhes 1983, p. 16. Slowworms are his servants.Shvabauer 2009, p. 63. Geographically, the folk tales came from the old Sysert Mining District, which included five mining plants, i. e. the Sysert Plant (Sysertsky or Sysertsky Zavod), the head plant of the district, Polevskoy (also known as Polevaya or Poleva), Seversky, Verkhny (Verkh- Sysertsky), and Ilyinsky (Nizhve-Sysertsky). The appearances of Poloz were often connected with the Polevskoy plant. Bazhov also introduced numerous daughters of the Snake, including Golden Hair from the tale of the same name. The relationship between him and another folklore creature, The Mistress of the Copper Mountain, is unclear. Bazhov noted that none of the people that he talked to seemed to know it. Bazhov believed that the most ancient creature of the Ural mythology is Azov Girl, the Snake appeared next, and the last one was the Mistress. It is further proved by the fact that Poloz is a zoomorphic being, as he probably comes from the era of totemistic beliefs.Shvabauer 2009, p. 59.  Plot  In this skaz, the old miner Levonty, a weak and ill man who spent all his life mining, decides to try gold digging to make ends meet. He can hardly work, and his family is very poor. One day he goes to the mine with his two little sons as usual. In the evening he goes to the river to fish. While the boys are waiting for Levonty, they are approached by a soldier Semyonich, a strange man who \\"had a lot of books\\" and \\"every evening he'd sit reading them\\". Semyonich has a certain reputation among the workers for having money seemingly out of nowhere. He feeds the children some bread and learns about a dire situation in their house. He promises to help them, but warns to keep it secret. Semyonich goes off and comes back with a green-eyed man. > He was all yellow, is tunic and trousers were gold, that brocade the priests > wear, and his wide girdle with a pattern and tassels hanging, from it was > brocade too, only it shone greenish. His cap was yellow with red flaps on > both sides, and his boots were gold too. [...] And his eyes were green, like > a cat's. But they had a kind look. He was the same height as Semyonich and > not stout, but heavy. The earth sank under him where he stood.Bazhov 1950s, > p. 147. The person's face is yellow too. \\"But what if we spoil these boys?\\", he asks Semyonich kindly. Semyonich defends the boys as humble, hard-working and not greedy. The man consents to his judgement, stating that he knows their father will not live long. He then tells the children to \\"watch for the trail\\" and dig along it. The man transforms into a giant serpent, and moves away leaving the trail behind. Semyonich explains that the man is Poloz the Great Snake (alternative translation: The Great Serpent), the lord of all that is gold. Next morning, the boys start digging for gold and quickly find two gold nuggets.  Analysis  Bazhov's Poloz, in addition to his traditional function of a treasure guardian, also fulfils the concept of social justice. He rewards the worthy and is dangerous to everyone else, especially to those who starts quarrels because of gold.Shvabauer 2009, p. 60. His gifts are not supposed to be shared.Shvabauer 2009, p. 61. In Bazhov's tales, his constant opponent is the wise eagle-owl.Shvabauer 2009, p. 70. Semyonich is a classical Bazhov's character. On the one hand, he is a truth seeker who is in contact with magical beings, on the other hand, he is an outsider, who is not accepted in the society. Denis Zherdev compared Poloz and the Mistress of the Copper Mountain, pointing out the male domain of Poloz is the world of order, structure, and hierarchy, and the power over gold is associated with the power of men. Unlike the Mistress, his appearance does not bring in unpredictability and destruction.  Adaptations  The Soviet playwright Klavdiya Filippova combined \\"The Great Snake\\" and \\"The Snake Trail\\" to create Poloz's Daughter (). The play was published in the 1949 collection Plays for Children's Theatre Based on Bazhov's Stories in Sverdlovsk. A 2007 Russian film The Golden Snake () is loosely based on \\"The Great Snake\\".

She graduated from Middlebury College in 1948 and earned her MA from Columbia University in 1949.  Career  She worked for System Development Corporation as assistant manager of corporate communications for 11 years. She ended her job there after she participated in an unauthorized survey of women employees that showed sex discrimination in advancement and salaries. She joined the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966. She founded Women's Heritage Corporation in 1969. The business published a series of paperbacks on women like Lucy Stone and Elizabeth Cady Stanton as well as an almanac and calendar. In 1970, she formed graphic arts firm Women's Graphic Communications with her partner Judith Meuli in Los Angeles. The firm produced and distributed books, newspapers, political buttons, and pins. In 1977, she became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Carabillo co-founded the Feminist Majority Foundation in 1987 with Meuli, Eleanor Smeal, Katherine Spillar, and Peg Yorkin. Carabillo was national vice president for the organization.

It is home to the deity Sankata, worshiped by both Hindus and Buddhists. Unlike other Bahals andu, Te Bahal has two dyochhes (houses for gods) indicating the existence of two bahals that were later merged into one.  History  Legend has it that during the rule of the Malla King, Narendra Dev, a Gubhajyu, a Buddhist sorcerer skilled in tantric practices, called Bandhu Ratna Bajracharya, with permission from the king, used his tantric powers and brought Sankata and Yogini into three different holy pitchers and worshiped them. Later, a temple for the goddess was established during the reign of King Gunakama Dev. To this day, every 12 years, a Buddhist priest gubhajyu from the temple of the Newar Bajracharya clan, worships the goddess in a holy pitcher along with another pitcher for Yogini at the Katuwal Daha at Chobhar and then the goddesses are enshrined in the temple. According to cultural expert Indra Mali, who grew up in Te Bahal, Sankata is not originally from Kathmandu. A legend states that Palah: Dya, as Buddhists call the deity, was brought from Kamaru Kamachya (the present Kamakhya) in Assam. Palah: Dya later became widely known as Sankata.  Rituals and festivals  The deity is worshipped by following secret tantric rituals. The priest must not be touched at the temple, nor must the statue of the goddess. The statue of the goddess is draped in cloth covering her body except for her head. Devotion to Sankata is commonly believed to ward off troubles and bad omens from one's life. Although religious rites are carried out every day, the temple is frequented mostly on Saturdays, or one's birthday. Everything required for worship is available right outside the temple. One can also ask the priests to do some puja for placating one's unfavorable planets and stars. For that, one would have to have oil, iron, black cloth, and black lentils. Every 12 years, the priest of the temple, a Buddhist Gubhaju of the Newar Bajracharya clan, worships the goddess in a holy pitcher along with another pitcher for Yogini at the Katuwal Daha at Chobhar and then the goddesses are enshrined in the temple.

It is possible that there was another church located at Ferkingstad prior to this one, but there are no existing records to confirm that. The only basis for this conjecture is that the records of the church from the 1600s state that the church inventory was described as old and worn, meaning the inventory for the church may have been reused from a previous church on the site. In 1853, a new church was constructed about to the south of the old church site. After the new church was completed, the old church was torn down.

The museum is accredited through the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) and has been since 1972. The Museum was formerly known as The Early American Museum but the name was changed to The Museum of the Grand Prairie. Mission The museum has a stated mission to collect, preserve and interpret the natural and cultural history of Champaign County and East Central Illinois. Permanent exhibits The museum currently has three permanent exhibits. The first, \\"The Grand Prairie Story\\", presents the story of the region and the people who have lived here. This exhibit ranges from Native Americans and settlers, to farmers and city folk, to the immigrants who came later along. This exhibit gives a large scale overview of all the different walks of life that have come through the great prairie. The second permanent exhibit is \\"Blacksmithing on the Prairie\\". The blacksmith exhibit is based upon the A.B Chesebro blacksmith shop that was founded in 1896 in Saunemin, Illinois. This family blacksmith shop was shown to the museum staff in 1993. The staff were so into it that they began performing some research into the shop‚Äôs history. They collected stories from different relatives and people from around the area and learned that the shop was last owned by A.B.‚Äôs son in the 1930s during the Great Depression. The shop was a block and frame shop for wagons at the time. The museum staff proceeded to photograph and categorize all of the objects and the layout of the shop. The museum now is in possession of 5,500 objects from the original shop, some of which can be seen in the exhibit. The shop was recreated partially at the museum and can now be visited to see the different tools and products of the day. The third permanent exhibit is \\"Champaign County‚Äôs Lincoln\\", which shows the way the county would have looked when Abraham Lincoln was in the area at the beginning of his political career. The first part of the exhibit is the buggy to show what kind of transportation would have been used at the time. It then progresses through a tavern, photo studio, and an area church with recordings on issues that would have been prevalent at the time.

Coffee in South Korea has been a strong element in South Korean culture. Originating in the 19th century, it has become a prominent commodity in South Korean marketplaces. It is one of the most popular beverages in the area.  History  According to Junman Kang's King Gojong goes to Starbucks (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥: Í≥†Ï¢Ö Ïä§ÌÉÄÎ≤ÖÏä§Ïóê Í∞ÄÎã§) states that King Gojong was the first person to taste coffee in Korea. Antoinette Sontag, the sister-in-law of a Russian ambassador, treated the king to a cup of coffee in 1896. Koreans were curious about foreign cultures and the new beverage. Because it came from the West and resembled Asian herbal medicine that only the rich could afford, it was consumed as a symbol of westernization and modernization. In the early days, people called coffee shop or caf√© \\"\\". The very first in Korea was built by Sontag as named Sontag Hotel at Junggu Jeongdong in Seoul in 1902. The modern type of dates from 1927 in Myeongdong and were spread to Jongno and Chungmuro. At first were open to the royal family and people in high positions and later were used as politicians‚Äô hall, artists‚Äô headquarters, and businessmen's meeting place. Koreans were fascinated by because they enjoyed the practice of drinking coffee in atmosphere; it was a great pleasure to experience using forks to have cake and drinking coffee in a teacup instead of using chopsticks and drinking Korean traditional soup out of a bowl. In mid-1900, continued to exist as a meeting place rather than as a place where people could drink coffee; however, it was not the time for ordinary citizens to consume coffee yet due to the high price. Before the introduction of coffee shops, people in high positions often held meetings at kisaeng houses while commoners hung out at jumaks to talk about their lives and politics. Since were the center of debates about politics, economy, culture, education, art, and religion by people of different professions, the Korean government strictly restricted individuals‚Äô visit to . In that sense, Korean caf√©s in 1950s were very similar to Parisian caf√©s in the late seventeenth century when the ‚Äúpolice [had] closely watched caf√©s‚Äù due to the caf√©s‚Äô function as social institutions (Haine 1992, 608). In the 1960s, the value of coffee skyrocketed because coffee was prohibited from due to the movement of using domestic products after dictator Park Chung-hee‚Äôs 5.16 military coup d'√©tat in 1961. However, in general became more open to middle class citizens in 1960s. Although were still for adults only, it became a popular dating place for young men and women. The first Korean theme caf√© was probably a music in the 1970s. This type of had disk jockeys who received song requests from customers and played record music for them. It provided a feeling of freedom to college students who could not express their political opinions openly in 1970s. As the competition amongst increased in the 1980s, they decorated themselves with distinctive items, such as pink lights and indoor waterfalls, to survive in the increasingly crowded marketplace. At that time, underwent huge changes in their atmosphere and menu. For example, dark with dividers to block others' views changed into the ones with bright and cozier atmospheres. This new type of coffee shop, which called themselves caf√©s to distinguish themselves from old style , began to focus on different kinds of coffee instead of selling traditional teas and sodas. In the 1990s, people thought that consumption had a style and preferred caf√©s with a neater interior design and professionalism in coffee. There was a huge shift in Korean caf√© culture's history in 1999 when Starbucks, the first foreign franchise coffee shop in Korea, was established in Sinchon, Seoul. Starbucks introduced Korea to a new caf√© culture, such as take-out and self-service system without good-looking waitresses and staying at a caf√© alone reading a book or doing homework. Since then, more foreign franchise coffee shops entered the market with a greater variety of coffee and atmosphere, and more local franchise caf√©s and small private-owned caf√©s appeared with their unique features.  Coffee consumption  As of 2015, there were an estimated 49,600 coffee shops in South Korea, and 17,000 coffee shops in Seoul, making Seoul's coffee-per-capita greater than that of Seattle or San Francisco. In 2013, it was estimated that around 657,000 tons of coffee were sold in South Korea, with a per capita coffee consumption of about 2.3 kg per person.  Roasters   Starbucks  A Starbucks in Seoul Starbucks opened its first store in 1999 and since 2011 has been opening about 80 new premises a year. The strong association with the South Korean public and the US has helped make coffee desirable and with many Koreans associating coffee and Starbucks as a lifestyle choice, it has become a status symbol throughout Seoul. Landlords are eager to have the brand open up a store in their buildings to enhance their value, reputation and image. The sudden influx of coffee shops have replaced the once traditional \\"\\" which were common meetings places serving a selection of customary teas. In addition to large US chains that have profited from the surge in demand for coffee, local businesses and entrepreneurs have also seized the opportunities. As of 2014 South Korean boasted 17,000 coffee shops and the capital, Seoul, had more outlets of Starbucks than any other city in the world, even New York.  Caff√© Bene  Caffe Bene is a coffeehouse chain based in Seoul. It was founded in May 2008 by Sun-Kwon Kim, its chief executive officer.

The meter is irregular, ranging from two to six stresses per line in no fixed pattern. The longest lines are at the end of the three stanzas and the rhyme never varies‚Äîeach stanza runs ABBACDCDEE. Donne's poems were known to be metaphysical with jagged rhythms, dramatic monologues, playful intelligence, and startling images. The poem personifies the sun. \\"John Donne is often considered the greatest love poet in the English language. He is widely known as the chief representative of metaphysical poets. Metaphysical poetry often includes styles like witty humour, irony, the use of paradoxes and play with words. Some themes of metaphysical poetry are love, geography and cosmology, romance, and man‚Äôs relationship with God. {Bennet, Joan, M.A. Four metaphysical poets Cambridge: The University Press, 1953. Print.} ‚ÄúThe Sun Rising‚Äù is one of John Donne‚Äôs most famous metaphysical poems. It is written with a humorous style and lots of exaggeration.\\"(- by AGS) Content Stanza one begins with the speaker in bed with his lover, complaining about sun's beaming rays. Donne uses expressions such as, \\"Busy old fool\\" (line 1) and \\"Saucy Pedantic Wretch\\" [perfectionist] (line 5) to describe his annoyance with it. The speaker of the poem questions the sun's motives and yearns for the sun to go away so that he and his lover can stay in bed. Donne is tapping into human emotion in personifying the sun, and he is exhibiting how beings behave when they are in love with one another. The speaker in the poem believes that, for him and his lover, time is the enemy. He asks, \\"Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?\\" (line 4) or, in other words, 'why must lovers be controlled by the sun?'. The speaker then tells the sun to bother someone else, \\"go chide late schoolboys and sour prentices, Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride...\\" (lines 5-7), and that love knows no season, climate, hour, day, nor month. In Stanza two, the speaker is saying how the sun believes its beams are strong but he could \\"eclipse\\" and \\"cloud them in a wink\\" (line 13). Although he can shield his eyes from the sun, he does not want to do that because it means he would be also shielding his eyes from his lover. He says, \\"But that I would not lose her sight so long\\" (line 14). The speaker proceeds to reprimand the sun and tells it to set, come back the next day, and tell him \\"whether both th' Indias of spice and mine be where thou lefst them, or lie here with me\\" (lines 16-18). He wants the sun to tell him if all the kings, queens, riches and gold of the world are still out there or lying in bed next to him. Towards the end of the stanza the speaker confirms, \\"Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday, and thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay\\" (lines 19-20), that his lover is above all kings and beside him in bed are all the riches and gold that he could ever want. Within the last stanza the speaker attempts to settle his anger in praising his lover. His lover is his world and when they are in bed together they are in their own microcosm of bliss. Stating that nothing else is half as important as his lover, the speaker insists \\"Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be to warm the world, that's done in warming us. Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere; this bed thy center is, these walls thy sphere\\" (lines 27-30). Which translates to his worrying about the sun's age and implying that all a sun is good for is warming up the world and its lovers, once it does that then its job is done. His lover is his whole world, and since the sun is shining on the bed composed of these two, then it is also shining on the entire world. Donne must have been well aware of the Copernican Heliocentric theory when he wrote \\"The Sun Rising. Perhaps it is even reflected in that little unexpected epithet, \\"unruly\\" ‚Äì suggesting the sun itself had challenged the Roman Catholic Church‚Äôs inquisition, the inquisition trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei as a suspected heretic, and the incompatibility of science and religion. The time period and its context, thirty years prior to Donne‚Äôs birth, acted as a source of inspiration for John Donne‚Äôs writing of ‚ÄúThe Sun Rising,‚Äù and perhaps is a critique of the Roman inquisition and counter-reformation movement. The developments in science such as the Heliocentric theory and its relation to Donne‚Äôs awareness of this is in his writing of the poem (Rumen).Rumen , Carol. ‚ÄúPoem of the week: John Donne‚Äôs the Rising Sun.‚Äù The Guardian. 5 Oct. 2009, theguardian.com, https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/05/john-donne-the-sun- rising. Criticism Some critics call Donne‚Äôs words in The Sun Rising ineffective because it lacks logic. Dr. Eric Otto argues that ‚Äúhe is still unsuccessful at convincing critical readers that internal love can symbolically replace the physical world if logic is subordinated to language.‚Äù In addition, it may be considered to be unsuccessful in convincing the reader of the power of love. Otto claims that ‚Äúupon condensing the world around his lover and himself, he calls back those objects that he initially excluded\\" (Otto).http://itech.fgcu.edu/&/issues/vol3/issue1/rhetoric.htm References 1633 poems Poetry by John Donne ","title":"The Sun Rising (poem)"},{"id":"48696336","text":"Joel D.

One participant (known as the game master or game leader) designs the labyrinth map, sets the game rules, and announces the results of each move. The other players attempt to traverse the labyrinth by uncovering its design and achieving the objective (usually, finding a treasure and exiting the labyrinth with it). The game, created in the Soviet Union during the 1970s, was popular among high school and college students throughout the USSR.  Overview, objective and structure  Labyrinth is played with a minimum of three people, one of whom is the game master. Each participant should have paper (preferably graph paper) and a pen or (preferably) a pencil. Players take turns as the game master, for one game each. Rules are agreed on before beginning a series of games. The game ends when only one player is left alive, or when one of the players exits the labyrinth with the treasure(s). Each player keeps track of all movements, directives and requests, recreating the labyrinth structure on their notepad. The square labyrinth's size determines the complexity and length of the game. Sizes range from to or . Each cell in the labyrinth may be one of the following: * Empty * Wormholes (optional), organized into sets * River (optional), with source and end: Several cells arranged in a chain which cannot intersect itself * Hospital (optional) * Arsenal, some of whose weapons a player may take when entering it * Treasure: At least one empty cell A wall can be built between any two neighbouring cells. The outside wall, known as the monolith, must have at least one exit (a space) so players can leave the labyrinth.  Gameplay  The game master creates the labyrinth. They and the players agree on the rules. At the start of the game, the game master sets the number and length of wormhole chains, rivers (if any) and weapon-related parameters such as the number of arsenals and the starting size of a player's weapons kit. Players take turns. With each turn, a player can move their marker to a neighbouring cell (a cell with a common, non-diagonal border with their current cell). After each move, the game master tells the player whether their move is possible. If it is, they tell the player what type of cell their marker is on: empty, arsenal, river, wormhole, exit, etc. If it is an obstacle, the game master tells the player if it is an ordinary wall or the monolith (labyrinth boundary). If a player shoots, then the game master tells them if another player is wounded or killed. All game-master announcements are made aloud, and players cannot form alliances or exchange information in secret. After learning the labyrinth parameters, each player secretly tells the game master where they want their marker placed at the beginning of the game; the game master may also place the markers randomly, so the players do not know their initial positions. Each player has a starting arsenal, with a set of weapons. Players move by making a step in any direction (saying \\"up\\", \\"down\\", \\"left\\" or \\"right\\"), or opting to skip a step. They can shoot in any direction before and after making a step, and the bullet travels in the stated direction until it hits a wall or a player. If it hits a player, they are declared wounded (or killed) by the game master. A player can stab by saying, \\"Use knife\\". If another player is in the same cell, they will be wounded or killed; the used knife is discarded. Players can blow up a wall in any direction by saying, \\"Throw grenade left/right/up/down\\", with the game master announcing the result. Any combination of weapons use can be used with any type of step request. When a step directive is given, the game master tries to move the marker in the requested direction and announces the result. If a player's marker moves to a wormhole, it automatically moves to the cell with the next wormhole in the chain. If the current position is the last one in the chain, the marker is moved to the chain's first wormhole. If a marker is moved into a river, it is then moved two cells downriver; if one of the cells is the river end, the marker stops there. If the marker is already in the river (but not at the end), the player can skip the step and the marker will flow downriver. If a marker is in the arsenal, the player's starting weapons are restored or they receive an additional set. If a wounded player is in the hospital, their health is restored. A wounded player cannot use weapons or carry treasure. If a player carrying treasure is wounded, the treasure remains in that cell until it is picked up. If the player is wounded in the river, the treasure flows two cells downriver after every move to the river end, where it can be picked up.

On the day it opened its doors to the public, December 1, 1891, The Evening Journal noted, \\"The opening of the Prendergast Library marks an important epoch in our local history. Few communities can boast so magnificent a public gift.\\" The mission of the James Prendergast Library is to provide access to information resources, staff, facilities and services that respond to the pursuit of knowledge, education, lifelong learning opportunities and cultural enrichment by the people of the City of Jamestown and Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties. In 2014, the library contained 179,746 individual works and received 208,080 visitors. The current Executive Director is Anne Greene, who was appointed by the Board of Trustees in February 2020. History On December 21, 1879, James Prendergast, 31, a prominent lawyer and grandson of the founder of Jamestown, unexpectedly died in Buffalo, NY, while being treated for an illness. He had begun to write a will, but it was not complete when he died. While arranging James' business affairs, his business partner, Eleazer Green, discovered a memorandum that James wished the income from his business interests, the Prendergast block, be used to establish a free library in Jamestown. On January 1, 1880, eleven days after his death, It was announced that James' parents, Alexander and Mary Prendergast, had already taken steps to ensure that their son's wishes would \\"be carried out to the every letter.\\" On January 29, 1880, the James Prendergast Library Association of Jamestown, New York, was established by special act of the New York State Legislature. The act was signed into law by Gov. Alonzo B. Cornell. The library first opened on December 1, 1891, at a cost of $60,000 for the building and $45,000 for a furnished art gallery. The initial collection comprised 7,555 works under the care of Samuel G. Love. A painting of James Prendergast (d. 1891) which hangs inside the James Prendergast Library in Jamestown, NY. Constructed by architect A.J. Warner of Rochester, the building had a Richardsonian Romanesque design with rounded arches, Medina sandstone exterior, and turret on the southeast corner. Mary Prendergast specifically dictated that the steps entering the building on the south side be cut from a single stone and that the library be surrounded by a rock wall on three sides. James Prendergast‚Äôs desire to have a free library was an idea ahead of its time. As was noted by the Association‚Äôs second librarian, Mary Emogene Hazeltine, ‚ÄúThere were no free libraries in the 1870s, as the movement for free circulating books did not even begin until 1876, was barely underway in 1893, and did not gain much head-way until 1900. For this reason, the memorandum found in James Prendergast‚Äôs desk, perhaps written as early as 1876 when he built the Prendergast block, proves him to have been a man ahead of his time.‚Äù Early years The libraries first children's room was opened in 1897. Located in the octagonal tower on the southeast corner of the building, the opening celebration was attended by more than 1,000 children. From the opening in 1891 until 1905, the stacks were closed to the public. The board decided to hold a five-week experiment and announced that as of November 1905 the stacks would be open for public browsing. On June 19, 1941, through the efforts of E. Snell Hall, the chairman of the library board, and a dedicated number of friends of the library, a new children's room was dedicated. Located in the basement where the old stack space had been, it held up to 18 children at one time. In 1960, the library joined and became the major central library of the two-county regional Chautauqua-Cattaraugus Library System. Renovation The addition to the library, which was completed in 1968 In 1960, a planned $250,000 expansion to the original building was announced. It was determined that the existing library space, which was handling an annual circulation of 200,000, was less than one-third adequate for operation. The addition was to contain a new main entrance, circulation desk, and all circulation materials. The existing art gallery would remain unchanged, as well as the south side of the building in order to maintain the traditional atmosphere of the library. Ground initially broke in 1961, focusing on a basement level addition and renovation for the newly formed Chautauqua- Cattaraugus Library System. The work continued again in 1968, expanding the library to its current size. All told, 16,500 square feet were added to the library at a cost of $562,000. Art Collection Jean Baptiste Robie, part of the Prendergast Bequest Since the opening of the library in 1891, an art gallery has been maintained. In her will, Mary Prendergast directed her executors to purchase paintings, for which she left $25,000, after her death in 1889. Much of the current collection consist of the original paintings with additions bequeathed to the library over the years. The first pieces of art consisted of 32 oil paintings, most purchased from the J.J. Gillespie Company Fine Art Galleries in Pittsburgh, PA, and most by European artists (Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Belgian, and French). The next pieces of art to be added to the collection were also from the Prendergasts: paintings from their personal collection consisting of landscapes of their property and family portraits. In 1960 the collection expanded by nine paintings via a donation by Elizabeth Gillmer Packard of Lakewood, NY. All of these pieces were by American painters. Other pieces have been donated by community members and organizations throughout the course of the library‚Äôs history.

In 1965 The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards prominently used and popularized the Maestro guitar sound on \\"Satisfaction\\", and in its wake many recordings, in particular from garage rock and psychedelic groups, featured guitars played through a Maestro. In the 1990s Gibson re-issued and again discontinued the FZ-1. History Earlier use of fuzz effects In the late 1950s, Guitarist Link Wray began intentionally overdriving his vacuum tube amplifiers to create a noisy and \\"dirty\\" sound for his solos after an accidental discovery. Wray also poked holes in his speaker cones with pencils to further distort the tone, used electro-mechanical echo chambers (then usually employed by singers), the recent powerful and \\"fat\\" Gibson humbucking pickups, and controlled \\"feedback\\" (Larsen effect). The resultant sound can be heard on his influential 1958 instrumental, \\"Rumble\\" and Rawhide. In 1961, Grady Martin scored a hit with a fuzzy tone accidentally caused by a faulty preamplifier that distorted his guitar playing on the Marty Robbins song \\"Don't Worry\\". Later that year he recorded an instrumental tune under his own name using the same faulty preamp. The song, on the Decca label, was called \\"The Fuzz.\\" Martin is generally credited as the discoverer of the \\"fuzz effect.\\" Shortly thereafter, the American instrumental rock band The Ventures asked their friend, session musician and electronics enthusiast Orville \\"Red\\" Rhodes for help recreating the Grady Martin \\"fuzz\\" sound. Rhodes offered The Ventures a fuzzbox he had made, which they used to record \\"2000 Pound Bee\\" in 1962. Introduction of the Maestro FZ-1 and FZ1a The Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone was designed by recording engineer Glenn Snoddy and WSM-TV engineer Revis V. Hobbs and manufactured by Gibson. Snoddy and Hobbs held issued October 19, 1965. Gibson introduced the FZ-1 in 1962, the first commercially available fuzzbox to gain widespread acceptance. The Maestro FZ-1 contained a three germanium transistor circuit with RCA 2N270 devices, powered by two 1.5-volt batteries, and a lead cable to connect it to an instrument (bass as it was originally intended, or guitar). Germanium devices are temperature sensitive, and the effect responds to the incoming signal's amplitude (volume) consistently. Upon release, Gibson/Maestro made a demonstration disc available, featuring sound samples of the different settings of the pedal and guitar combination, emphasising the \\"brass-like\\" quality of certain tones. The circuit made its way into the body of Gibson's EB-0F \\"fuzz basses\\" (circa 1964). Initially, the Fuzz Tone's sales were disappointing, but after the success of the Rolling Stones' 1965 hit \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\\" the device became a huge success. During the recording of \\"Satisfaction\\" in May 1965, Keith Richards used a FZ-1 on the song's distinctive guitar riff. According to Richards, he originally intended to use a brass section for the riff, but settled on the Fuzztone as a substitute. As a result of the unforeseen demand for the device, all available stock sold out by the end of 1965. The pedal became a favorite of many garage rock and psychedelic bands of the time. Other early fuzzboxes include the Mosrite FuzzRITE, the Sola Sound Tone Bender MkI. A few years later others followed, such as the Arbiter Group Fuzz Face used by Jimi Hendrix, the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi used by Hendrix and Carlos Santana. In late 1965, the circuit was revised, using 2N2614 or 2N2613 transistors, with pertinent biasing network, powered by a single, 1.5-volt battery. The model was re- designated as the FZ-1a, keeping the same wedge shaped enclosure as the FZ-1. In 1968, an updated model with a different look and sound was introduced, with a circuit designed by Robert Moog using a 9-volt power supply and alternatively two or four silicon transistors, and labelled the Maestro FZ-1B. It went through three circuit revisions. In the 1970s Maestro came out with the FZ-1S Super-Fuzz, which had a distinctly different look and sound than previous models. Re-issue and reproductions Gibson briefly re-issued the Maestro FZ-1A Fuzz-Tone in the 1990s, but later discontinued the model. It has not been manufactured since. Other brands have offered models attempting to replicate the sound of the FZ-1 and FZ-1A.

Originally a sergeant of the Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon Regiment in the Imperial Russian Army, he deserted and became one of the many defectors who changed sides in the era of the Russo-Persian Wars. Biography From at least the 19th century, and probably earlier, a steady stream of deserters from the Imperial Russian armies in the Caucasus fled to Iranian territory, sometimes surrendering to Iranian forces and entering Iranian service. Iran's then commander-in-chief, crown-prince Abbas Mirza, was eager to acquire and retain the services of as many Russian deserters as possible, because their military training was a useful asset to his new regular army. At first he used individual deserters to train his new regiments. As their numbers grew, he incorporated them into the Nezam regiments, and finally made them into a separate unit of their own. One of the more notable deserters who enlisted in the Iranian service was Samson Yakovlevich Makintsev, a staff-trumpeter sergeant, who deserted from the Nizhni-Novgorod Dragoon Regiment in 1802, just before the start of the first Russo-Persian War of the 19th century (1804‚Äì1813). He was born in 1780 in the Caucasian Line of Ukrainian origin and was the child of a soldier.Berge, Adolf –°–∞–º—Å–æ–Ω-—Ö–∞–Ω –ú–∞–∫–∏–Ω—Ü–µ–≤ –∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –±–µ–≥–ª–µ—Ü—ã –≤ –ü–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ 1806-1853 –≥–≥ (in Russian) edition; –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞. publisher; –¢–∏–ø. –í.–°. –ë–∞–ª–∞—à–µ–≤–∞, 1876. Vol. 15 page 772 He joined the Dragoon regiment in 1799 at the age of 19. The service record of Lieutenant General V.V. Grushenko‚Äôs Nizhni-Novgorod Dragoon Regiment for 1January 1800 records the following information about Makintsev: \\"Samson Makantsov, Yakov's son. 19 years of age, height 2 arshins, 41/2 vershoks (162cm). White face, light blond hair, grey eyes. Can read and write Russian. Unmarried. Taken into Major O.A. Kulikovskii's squadron as a dragoon on 14September 1799, from the soldiers' children with the regiment who had attained adulthood.\\"RGVIA, f. 489, op. 1, d. 2476, l. 1506-116. The reference to Makantsov as being of the \\"soldier's children\\" (soldatskie deti) meant that he was in fact part of a juridically defined social category stipulated in the Imperial Russian Petrine ranking system. According to the ranking system, the soldiers' children belonged to the military domain (voennoe vedomstvo) and were therefore destined for life in the military service. His membership in this social class probably also explains why he was literate, at a time when this was very uncommon for lower-ranking Russian soldiers. As a member of soldatskie deti, he would have been eligible to enter the special military schools and receive some education. In Persia Historian Stephanie Cronin states that the reason for his desertion is not definitely known, but the men of his regiment apparently believed that he had stolen the mouthpieces from the regiment's silver trumpets. After fleeing the regiment in 1802, then 22 years old, he gave himself up to the Iranians, entered Abbas Mirza's service, and was appointed a lieutenant in one of the new Nezam-e-Jadid (lit. \\"new army\\") regiments, the fawj-i-Erivan (the Erivan regiment), named after one of Iran's threatened Caucasian provinces. Through his efforts, which included the enlisting of other fugitives into the ranks, Makintsev earned promotion to the rank of major. Soon one half of the Erivan regiment was made up of deserters. Seemingly having noticed Abbas Mirza's approval, the Russians expressed their dissatisfaction with the regiment's Iranian commander and to ask that he be replaced by Makintsev. Abbas Mirza, who was unwilling to place a mixed unit that included Muslim Iranians under direct Russian rule, instead formed the deserters into a separate unit, giving its command and the rank of colonel, and later general, to Makintsev, who took the name Samson Khan. Makintsev quickly gained the complete confidence of Abbas Mirza, who gave the Russians the name Bahadoran (heroes) and used them to constitute his palace guard. The most reliable element in the Nezam-e-Jadid, they were better trained and more regularly paid than the native troops, and the king (Fath Ali Shah Qajar), and Abbas Mirza in particular, relied on them to suppress domestic rebellions. They were especially used in any issue related to \\"discontent with a religious flavour\\". At first Makintsev recruited amongst the Russians whom he found in Tabrizdeserters, prisoners of war, and even runaway peasants. As Cronin notes, after his regiment suffered severe losses in the 1804‚Äì1813 Russo-Persian War, Makintsev started an active approach. Not waiting for deserters to arrive in Tabriz of their own accord, he made every effort to encourage the flight of soldiers in the Russian army then occupying the Iranian territory that is modern-day Azerbaijan. He employed a range of methods, including \\"enticements, money and cunning\\", and he organized schemes to encourage troops to desert their Russian units. Persuasion was tried first, and then Makintsev's men would ply the Russians \\"with wine and seize them\\". The reputation of Makintsev, now with the rank of general, as a trusted soldier of the crown prince and commander-in-chief, Abbas Mirza, and the welcome awaiting for those who deserted by this time well known among the Russian troops, led to a constant stream of deserters. Several hundred Russian prisoners of war were also enlisted into the Bahadoran regiment of the Nezam-e Jadid. Cronin notes that as time passed, the sons of deserter-troops who had married in Iran were, in a continuation of the Russian practise, also enlisted into the regiment. The strength of the regiment fluctuated. In 1822 they were estimated to number 800‚Äì1,000 troops, but after the second Russo-Iranian War (1826‚Äì1828) it was reported that there were as many as 3,000. In 1833 alone, 400 new deserters arrived from Russia. Compared to the native Nizam troops, this was a comparatively substantial number, which, though also fluctuating and uncertain, probably amounted to around 12,000 by the early 1830s, according to Cronin. Some decided to settle permanently in Iran, integrating into local society, their habitual drunkenness apparently presenting no impediment to social acceptance. Some yearned to return home, but many married and established families. Makintsev himself married and had children, and those who married were given land and apparently lived well. Makintsev inhabited a large house in the Tabriz arg (citadel), having made an extremely advantageous marriage to the daughter of Prince Alexander of Georgia, a Georgian exile, who was living in Iran proper as well. The regiment of Makintsev was the fighting core of the Nizam-i-Jadid, and appears to have possessed a considerable military capacity. During the Russo-Iranian War of 1804‚Äì1813, Makintsev's regiment accompanied other regiments to the decisive Battle of Aslanduz in October 1812. Though overall a disaster for the Iranians, the deserters under Makintsev appear to have engaged the troops under General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky with some success, reportedly nearly annihilating them. Kotlyarevsky on the other hand acted quickly to take revenge, for the deserters amongst the prisoners were hanged and bayoneted. By the time of the 1826‚Äì1828 war, the deserters had developed qualms, and Makintsev tried to avoid a direct confrontation in the fighting, declaring that the \\"Russians had sworn on the Holy Gospel that they would not fire on fellow Christians\\". Abbas Mirza, however, was determined to use his expertise and made him his military adviser, and the regiment subsequently went on campaign on the condition that it would be kept in reserve, though it eventually was involved in military operations. After the campaign, Makintsev retired from active service. He then appointed his new son-in-law, Yevstafii Vasilievich Skryplev, a non- commissioned officer recently deserted from the Nasheburg infantry regiment, the new colonel and regimental commander. Russia had been making extensive efforts and appeasement policies for years towards the deserters to repatriate them, with, eventually, relatively high success. Makintsev himself declined the offer, however, apparently out of fear that he would be treated differently from the other deserters, tried separately, and punished. He died in 1849 and was buried under the altar of an Orthodox church (Saint John Church of Sohrol) that he himself had built. By the early 1850s the deserter regiment of which Makintsev had once been part had vanished, its remnants in Iran absorbed into the native Nizam units.

Purpose Since at least the Roman Empire, fortifications, walls and barriers have been an important part of protecting sovereign territories and private property. Perimeter security is designed with the primary purpose to either keep intruders out or captives contained within the area the boundary surrounds. Both natural and manmade barriers can serve as perimeter security. Governments use perimeter security not only for the safety of their citizens, but to control the flow of commerce and immigration, as well as to protect vital infrastructure from vandals and terrorists. Property owners and organizations of all sizes use various man- made technology to achieve varying degrees of perimeter security. History One of the earliest known instances of perimeter security on a large scale is that of Hadrian's Wall in the Roman Empire. Around 122 AD the wall was built up along the northern border of the empire out of turf and later, stone. Theories regarding the wall's purpose vary, but most agree it was probably built at least in part for the defense of the empire. Perhaps the most obvious illustration of perimeter security in ancient times, the Great Wall of China was originally built to withstand nomadic invaders from the North. The wall was successful to some degree, although it has been suggested that it served as more of a psychological barrier than a successful physical barrier. In warfare, securing the perimeter has proven vital to military forces. From sharpened pikes in medieval times to more modern technological solutions, armed forces have always sought to prevent their enemies from breaching their front lines. In the American Civil War and both World Wars, as well as the Korean and Vietnam Wars, landmines were used extensively to create tactical barriers between enemy lines. These tactics are sometimes controversial because of the loss of civilian life. In World War II, the German military developed concrete barriers called dragon's teeth to slow the approach of enemy tanks. This tactic was adopted by allied forces, and lines of reinforced concrete pyramids can still be seen throughout Europe today. One example of perimeter protection still in use is razor wire fencing. While U.S. ranchers in the 19th century kept the cattle in and the rustlers out with barbed wire, World War I saw the advent of specialized barbed wire to secure military operations. The 1965 escalation of the Vietnam War was accelerated by the successful penetration of ten foot high concertina wire (razor wire) fencing around Camp Holloway. Variations of this type of perimeter protection were used prolifically throughout the 20th century. Booby traps, electric fencing, watch towers and night flares were also vigorously employed to keep enemy forces out. Natural barriers The mountains, rivers, oceans, deserts, canyons and glaciers of the world have long provided a natural barrier to invasion and trade among competing cultures. India's isolation from the rest of Asia via the Himalayas is a prime example. The English Channel proved invaluable in World War II as a deterrent to Nazi aggression. England's relative isolation allowed allied forces to use it as a staging area for the D-Day invasion, which turned the tide of the war. The Rocky Mountains in North America proved a formidable perimeter protection of isolated native cultures for centuries. Likewise, exploitation of Alaska's rich resources was greatly delayed while innovation lagged in breaking through the icy and oceanic perimeter. Technology has largely subjugated most of the world's great natural barriers. However, deep in the Amazon remain tribes that are somewhat protected from global society due to the natural barrier of naturally harsh conditions and the vast tributary system of the Amazon River. A similar argument can be made regarding the world's deserts. Even with advanced technology, the lack of water and harsh temperatures make traversing and living in the world's deserts a journey for a relative few. The Sahara Desert is a prime example. Fences Invented in the mid-1800s, the chain link fence did not achieve major adoption until industrialized manufacturing began in the United States in 1898. Still in heavy use today, this relatively cost effective perimeter is popular due to its transparency, strength, storage, and ease of installation. From airports to school playgrounds, chain link fencing demand remains strong as a long-term perimeter solution. However, fences alone can be easily circumvented, which has led to well known incidences of airport perimeter security breaches, a man scaling the fence at the White House, etc. Most perimeter protection solutions in the past have been large-scale, stationary solutions. This causes a great challenge for today's mobile industry and military. With smaller, rapid deployment forces the norm for most of today's military engagements, large walls, high fences, and other permanent solutions aren‚Äôt always effective. Deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan provide good examples. Electronic technology Beginning with the advent of electronic sensors, the concept of perimeter security evolved rapidly to include more modern, technological solutions. This allows both private entities and governments to protect wider areas with less manpower involved. In World War II radar was first introduced to detect airplanes and ships and later ground targets. Later, ground surveillance radar was coupled with steerable cameras that were automatically cued onto targets for quick evaluation of the threat. These systems were large and very expensive. In the military, small force deployment has created complex perimeter protection problems. It has also created opportunities for innovation. Secure wireless communications, lightweight weaponry, faster transport and portable perimeter protection have all become vital to the success of such missions. Compact surveillance radar (CSR) deployable in minutes provides temporary or portable perimeter security. While military applications have pressed the innovation for more mobile, affordable perimeter protection, today's growing threats to homeland security have launched another wave of pioneering products to protect airports, bridges, harbors, dams and electrical substations. These include solutions such as thermal cameras, compact radar, microwave and radiowave fences, and biometric scanning, most of which can be linked to smartphone or tablet technology.

It was written by Michael Grassi and Rachel Shukert, and directed by Jesse Warn. The episode centers on Kara feeling the pressure as she takes on an android commissioned by Lucy's father, General Sam Lane, while Cat's estranged mother comes to visit and Winn helps Alex investigate her father's death. Plot During a flight around National City, Supergirl accidentally scares some kids after breaking up road rage between two men and hurting one of them badly. Hank is not happy with Kara's behavior, and Maxwell is now leading a campaign to place regulations on Supergirl. Later on, Lucy asks James to have dinner with her father, General Sam Lane, who doesn't get along with James because he's friends with Superman. At CatCo, Cat gets a visit from her mother Katherine, who has been critical of her daughter. Hank calls Kara and Alex in to the DEO base camp to test out a new weapon that was commissioned by Sam. The android, Red Tornado, is introduced by Dr. T.O. Morrow, who objects to how his project is treated. Meanwhile, Cat cleared her calendar for Katherine, only for her mother to tell her she has plans. The next day, Kara begins her training with Red Tornado and Kara is pushed to her breaking point. After the project starts to experience damage, Kara is unaware of being told to stand down, causing it to take off. Sam then blames Supergirl for unleashing Red Tornado and orders it destroyed. After Kara yells at Cat, Cat tells her to find what she's mad at, since she knew that Kara wasn't mad at her. Red Tornado arrives to attack the Lanes after their dinner and James uses his signal watch to alert Kara, who immediately shows up to stop it, only to have the android create a tornado that puts it in harm's way. At Lord Technologies, Maxwell states that, judging from his samples, Red Tornado is being controlled remotely by Morrow. Meanwhile, Kara and James set up punching bags, as Kara takes out her anger about being an alien and not fitting in. Alex then calls Kara to inform her that she found a way to draw Red Tornado's attention by using a hologram of Sam and that the only way to stop Morrow is to remove it or kill him. The android shows up to attack Kara, but after Alex kills Morrow, is shown to be unstoppable, almost killing Kara, and causing her to use her heat vision at full force to destroy it. The following day, Lucy says to James that they're on the same team and hopes that they can reconcile. Winn, having been convinced by Alex to find out more about their father, reveals that Jeremiah and Hank went missing after going to apprehend an alien and were presumed dead. Hank had survived and been deleting information from their father's file, causing them to become suspicious of Hank. Later at Cat's office, Katherine starts yelling at Kara and Cat snaps back, defending her, causing Katherine to excuse herself. Cat drops a glass, and Kara cuts her finger on it, surprising herself and feeling human. Reception Ratings The episode attracted 950,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the most watched programme on Sky One for the week. Critical response Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted: Red Faced' is a nice rebound from last week's lame installment. As I mentioned last week, Supergirl is at its best when it focuses on family dynamics and moments of connection between its characters that don't focus on romance, and this episode definitely showed that off. It lures you into thinking Kara's anger issues are tied to her crush on James, but then it quickly reveals there's a deeper and more complex reason.\\"\\"Supergirl: Red Faced\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 30, 2015) Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode an 8.6/10, saying, Red Faced' is a great episode that really digs its claws into Kara‚Äôs character and forces her to confront emotions that have been bubbling under the surface. It really stacks the odds against her and urges her to overcome them. Combined with great scenes with Cat, fun action sequences, and emotional punch at the end, this week‚Äôs Supergirl stands as the show‚Äôs strongest feat thus far.\\" Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\"Supergirl Season 1 Episode 5 Review: Red Faced\\" from TV Fanatic (November 30, 2015) References External links * 2015 American television episodes Supergirl (TV series) episodes Television episodes about androids ","title":"Red Faced"},{"id":"48696962","text":"Pedro Mendes (born 1987) is a Swiss model and male beauty pageant titleholder who was named Mister International 2015 at the finals held at the Newport Performing Arts Theater at Resorts World Manila in Pasay City, Metro Manila, the Philippines.

The series was based on the 1973 made-for-TV movie Sunshine and DeYoung, Bill Mumy, Corey Fischer, and Meg Foster all reprised their roles from the film. The series originally ran for 13 episodes on NBC in the spring of 1975. The show's opening theme was John Denver's hit song \\"Sunshine on My Shoulders.\\" Plot Three years after the death of his wife Kate (which occurred at the end of the 1973 Sunshine film), musician Sam Hayden (Cliff DeYoung) is raising their young daughter Jill (Elizabeth Cheshire) as a single father. Sam struggles to make ends meet by playing in a folk rock trio with Weaver (Bill Mumy) and Givits (Corey Fischer) and by doing various day jobs. Although Sam's responsibilities leave little time for him to date women, he hopes to find one he can love who will also be a good mother to Jill. Meanwhile, Weaver, Givits, and Sam's occasional girlfriend Nora (Meg Foster) pitch in to help Sam care for Jill.

A Chicago Tribune reviewer also blamed the series' failure on its portrayal of daughter Jill as an ill-mannered \\"pest\\". Sunshine performed poorly in the Nielsen ratings and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After its cancellation, the series was described as being \\"before its time\\" and \\"one of the most interesting failures\\" of the season. Five episodes of Sunshine were later combined into a feature-length movie called My Sweet Lady which was widely circulated in England, Japan and Australia, resulting in the characters becoming better known in those countries than they were in the United States. In 1977, NBC took the unusual step of reuniting the original cast of the cancelled series for a two-hour holiday television film, Sunshine Christmas, which the network first aired on December 12, 1977. In the movie, Sam and Jill return to his native Texas to visit Sam's parents, and Sam rekindles a romance with his high school sweetheart. Book adaptation In 1975, a novelization of the series by Norma Klein entitled The Sunshine Years was published. Klein had previously written the novelization of the Sunshine film, and later did the same for Sunshine Christmas.

The Great Flood theme, in which a flood almost wipes out the entire human race followed by the procreation of a brother and sister pair to repopulate the earth, is a popular mythological theme in China. Chen Jianxian (1996) said that this theme was one of the more popular legends which was still being told by more than 40 ethnics in China. There is a possibility that the myth is newer than the other Chinese great flood mythologies, because the oldest recorded sources about this myth were from Six Dynasties, save that the oral tradition maybe much older. The myth narrates a brother and sister incest and often confused with the myth of N√ºwa and Fuxi (Shan Hai Jing described both the divine ancestors as brother and sister who married each other to populated the earth with human beings). Another version paired Pangu with his unnamed older sister as the main characters of this myth. The theme has several variations, but the outline describes a great flood which destroyed all the humans all over the world except a pair of brother and sister, or aunt and nephew. Both ended up married in order to repopulate the world. One version stated that their children were ordinary humans, while the others said it was a lump of meat, gourd, melon, or grindstone; after they opened, cut, or destroyed it, humans emerged. The Thunder God's Revenge Chen Jianxian presumed the origin of this myth is from Miao people. In this version, the story begin with the dissension between the human ancestor whose name is varied with the thunder god. One day, the human ancestor managed to confine the thunder god, but his children (sometimes named as Fuxi and N√ºwa) released him out of pity. The thunder god gave them a seed of gourd or pumpkin or his own tooth and told them that there would be a great flood. All the humans perished except the brother and sister who hid themselves inside the gourd. To repopulate the earth, they married each other after receiving an \\"agreement sign from the heaven\\" (which is different depends on the sources). Some versions said that the sister gave birth to a gourd; both cut the gourd into pieces and each pieces became the ancestors of different tribes, and so on. There are other similar versions as written below. Once upon a time, a farmer was working in his field when he heard thunder. He took his children (N√ºwa and Fuxi) inside their house, prepared an iron cage, and armed with pitchfork. When the thunder god Lei Gong appeared with his thunder axe, the farmer stabbed him and locked him inside the cage. The farmer planned to kill the god and pickle him, and he went into the market to buy the spices after warning his children not to go near the god and gave him anything to eat or drink. Both the kids obeyed their father until they pitied the thunder god who asked them for food and water. After the kids gave him a drop of water, his strength was returned and he freed himself from the cage. He gave the frightened kids his own tooth to be planted, which grew into a gourd plant. Lei Gong leaped into the sky and commanded the rain god to pour the water as heavy as he could. Meanwhile, the farmer came into his house, the flood was already as high as his knees. He knew what happened and made a boat, put his children inside the magical gourd, and climbed into the boat. The water level continued to rise until it almost reach the heaven. The farmer knocked the heaven's gate and asked Taidi to stop the rain. Taidi realized what was about to be happened and ordered the water god to get rid of the water at once. The water was gone, the boat was falling from the sky and crashing into the ground along with the farmer, but his children inside the gourd was safe. After they climbed out of the gourd, both the kids realized that they were the only survivors of human kinds and decided to married and repopulated the earth. A bit different version named the survivor boy as A Zie. After the flood, he planned to married his older sister to in order to repopulate the earth but was rejected because she was hesitant to violate the incest taboo. After reasoning with her, she agreed to accept his marriage proposal with a condition: they should both go up to the top of opposite hills, taking with them each a part of a millstone, and roll the millstone down into the valley in the middle. If both parts of the millstones manage to perfectly collide straight into each other, she would marry her younger brother. A Zie, realising that his sister's condition was almost impossible, prepared already collided millstones in the bottom of the valley without her knowledge before they climbed on the hills and rolled their millstones, making it appear as if he won. But his sister did not expect this and was still reluctant, so she proposed another condition which was the same as the first one but the objects they would carry would be different. He carried a knife and she carried its sheath; she would marry her younger brother only if the knife was inserted into the sheath. A Zie made the same trick by setting up a duplicate knife and sheath in advance. Finally she agreed to the marriage, and they consummated. She conceived and bore her younger brother's first child, which was a lump of meat without arms and legs. The maddened A Zie cut off their offspring into pieces and scattered it to the rest of the hill. The next morning the pieces of the meat became both male and female humans, making A Zie and his older sister the progenitors of the humans that lived after the flood. There are another version which stated that the brother could not meet his sister's condition and so both of them were not married. They created living humans from clay. While they dried the clay dolls under the sun, the rain was pouring and the couple tried to save their creations. Unfortunately, some of the dolls lost their arms, legs, eyes, and so forth, explained why some people are disabled. Human Ancestor Marries a Heavenly Maiden The theme is spread among Nakhi and Yi people. There were some brothers who worked at their field but their work was undone in the next morning; this happened for several days. The brothers found out that every nights their field was being spoiled by a boar. They planned to kill the boar except one; and for his benevolent, the boar which was actually a god told him that there would be a devastating great flood on its way. The youth climbed into a leather-covered drum or wooden box, which was carried into the heaven by the ever-rising water level. In heaven, he met a heavenly maiden and fell in love with her. He must pass a series of tests before they are able to be married, while their offspring became the ancestors of the Tibetan, Nakhis, and Bais. The last version is a mixture from different myths. There were two brothers and one sister who hoed the field, which was vandalized by a god. The god later told them for the coming great flood, he told the younger brother and sister to aboard on a giant gourd, while to the older ill-tempered brother into a stone boat. The brother and sister inside the giant gourd were saved. He married his older sister, and she bore him a boy who eventually married a heavenly maiden.

It chronicles her emigration from her hometown of Polotsk in the Russian Empire (now modern Belarus) to the United States in 1894, focusing primarily on her observations of life in unfamiliar surroundings, the emotional trials endured by her family, and the hardships that accompanied their passage to and eventual settlement in Boston, Massachusetts. Her first major publication, it laid the groundwork for her later autobiography and most famous work, The Promised Land (1912).  Publication origins and inspiration  Compiled from a series of letters that Antin wrote to her uncle describing her family's journey to America in 1894, From Plotzk to Boston was inspired by the difficulties that compelled them to leave their homeland as well as Antin's own literary upbringing. Born Maryashe Antin to Israel Pinchus and Esther Antin in 1881, she spent her early years living with her Russian-Jewish family in Polotsk, where she received a private education until a combination of illness and business failures depleted the family's resources and prompted them to immigrate to the United States. Upon arriving in 1894, Antin proceeded to enroll in primary school where her proficiency for the English language allowed her to excel academically and gain positive notice from her teachers. Recognizing her literary talent, they encouraged her writing and secured a publishing deal for her first book with the help of local Jewish philanthropists. Drawing from her correspondence with her uncle, Antin translated her writings from Yiddish to English and consolidated the materials into a memoir. Titled From Plotzk to Boston due to a misprinting of the name of her hometown, its release in 1899 provided a valuable source of income to fund Antin's continued education. Contents The memoir begins with Antin's recollection of the financial pressures and tales of American prosperity that swept her hometown of Polotsk in 1891, triggering a massive wave of emigration from Russia to the United States. Struggling to make a living and intrigued by the promise of a better life abroad, her father decides to move the family to America and departs by himself that same year for Boston to secure the employment and income needed to finance passage for the rest of the family. Leaving Polotsk with her mother, two sisters, and brother three years later, Antin describes their travels through Europe and across the Atlantic to join her father.Antin, pp. 11-13. Traveling westward through Russia by train, the family passes through multiple villages and cities that Antin notes for their vibrancy and technologically modern environments compared to the isolated hometown life that she knows. At the same time, she reflects upon the conflicted emotional state of her family, who experience mixed feelings of uneasiness, sadness, and affection for the home and the people that they are leaving.Antin, pp. 17-18.Antin, pp. 22. Antin describes how upon arriving at the German border, the family confronts bureaucratic obstacles that prevent them from moving onward and experience prejudice from German authorities in light of a recent cholera epidemic allegedly spread by Russian emigrants. In response to pleading from Antin's mother, however, a sympathetic officer instructs them to contact Herr Schidorsky, a prominent member of the local Jewish community, who provides them with assistance through his familial connections in the German bureaucracy.Antin, pp. 24-27.Antin, pp. 30-32. As a result of this intervention, the family is able to resume their journey, making their way across the German border towards the port city of Hamburg, but not before subjecting themselves to multiple invasive luggage screenings, health examinations, and unsolicited travel services that they are later billed for. During this segment of the journey, they also establish friendships with fellow travelers and experience culture shock from the overwhelming sounds and activity of the urban life that surround them as they pass through Berlin.Antin, pp.35-37 Antin recounts that when they arrive in Hamburg, the family is processed and placed in a crowded √©migr√© camp with poor accommodations, where they await the arrival of their ship to America, Polynesia. After many days of waiting, the family is finally called to board the ship and for the next 17 days, Antin and her family endure harsh conditions below deck, including turbulence, seasickness, and crowded quarters. While simultaneously feeling sadness for departing her homeland and a resolve to push forward and reunite with her father, Antin also expresses her astonishment and wonder at the sight of the ocean and ship activity around her. Arriving in Boston harbor on May 8, 1894, her journey arrives at an emotional conclusion with the reunion of her family and father.Antin, pp. 52, 57-62, 66-69, 76-80. Release and reception Largely marketed towards Boston's community of Jewish philanthropists, From Plotzk to Boston immediately sold out its initial pressrun in 1899, with Lina Hecht, one of Antin's major benefactors, purchasing the entire first run of 50 copies, requiring the printing of a second edition. Contemporary reviews were also generally positive, with the New York Times concluding, ‚ÄúThis story, in all its guilelessness, appealing as it does to human love, will certainly please readers, irrespective of race or creed.‚Äù Offering similar praise for her writing and the perceived authenticity of her work, the Boston Herald stated, ‚ÄúThe whole narrative is very agreeably and naturally written, and nothing is introduced but what the child saw with her own eyes, endured in her own flesh and blood, thought in her own little head.‚Äù Other publications drew favorable comparisons with Israel Zangwill, the author of the book's preface and an accomplished Jewish writer himself, with the Kalamazoo Gazette proclaiming, ‚Äúlittle Mary promises to become the most forceful Jewish writer of English in the world, not excepting Zangwill himself.‚Äù Historical significance From Plotzk to Boston is significant to the study of immigration history for providing an intimate view into the individual experiences, feelings, and circumstances that inspired and shaped immigrant journeys to the United States during the late 19th century. As a personal account of Antin's travels from her homeland in Russia to her settlement in the United States, it offers a glimpse into the American immigrant population at a time when Eastern Europeans were supplanting earlier groups from the western and northern areas of the continent in representation among the total number of new arrivals to the United States. Accordingly, it serves to highlight the social and political forces that influenced immigrants' travels and the attendant pressures that compelled many Russian Jews in particular to depart for the United States in search of a better standard of living, including religious persecution, government oppression, and economic hardship.Antin, pp. 24-25. Within this context, the memoir is also important to popular understandings and scholarly analysis of the historical immigrant experience for its role in establishing the framework for the American Dream narrative of assimilation. Introduced and described in detail by Antin in her later work The Promised Land, this narrative presents an idealistic and generalized interpretation of immigrant movement and assimilation experiences in which immigrants are uniformly depicted as escaping from poverty, oppression, and prejudice in their homeland for a new life in the United States. Under this paradigm, Antin's experiences reinforce a vision of America as a safe haven where freedom, prosperity, and opportunity are available for all regardless of personal background and with few barriers to social and economic advancement.

The focus of the DDPP is on sustainable energy systems, other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and land-use, are not directly considered.  Methods  Analyses of possible scenarios assume no major changes in culture and rely on existing technology. They assume no major changes in the lifestyles of people in developed countries and do not include possible future technologies such as nuclear fusion. Population growth of 1% per year and economic growth of 3% is assumed. Analyses show a need for continued research on energy technologies. The DDPP rejects an incrementalist approach to climate protection. Instead, meeting the climate change mitigation challenge (as set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement) will require backcasting to a suitable attractor, such as complete decarbonization. This method allows short-term policy options to be developed that are consistent with the selected long-term target. Even so, there are numerous possible deep decarbonization pathways (DDP) for each country and stakeholders and policymakers will need to debate and choose one, building the necessary political consensus as they go. DDPs can help avoid dead-end investments that reduce emissions in the short-term but obstruct deep decarbonization in the long-term and thereby reduce the risk of becoming stranded. The PDF is open access. In 2016, the project proposed a new conceptual decision framework for deep development pathways (DDP) analysis across its 16 participating countries. This includes an agenda for the further development of modelling methodologies. A key motivation is to address the \\"intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility.\\"  Findings  DDPPs analyses show that meeting a goal of limiting the rise of global temperature due to 2¬∞C or less is barely possible using existing technology, if it were deployed, however long term plans are not in place to do so. As of early 2016, the DDPP was composed of energy researchers and institutions across the following economies and covering 74% of global energy- related greenhouse gas emissions: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, the UK and the US.

(or V√≠king bj√≥r) is an Icelandic brand, brewed by CCEP \\"V√≠king Brewery\\". The brewery is located in Akureyri, Iceland, just south of the Arctic Circle. The brand name is derived from the Vikings. History of the brewery The history of the brand of V√≠king beer can be traced back to 1939 when Efnager√∞ Siglufjar√∞ar was established in the town of Siglufj√∂r√∞ur in Northern Iceland. In 1945, the brewery moved to Akureyri and the name was changed to Efnager√∞ Akureyrar. In 1962, a new factory was built at Furuvellir 18, where it is still located today. The brewery name was changed to V√≠king hf. in 1994. The brewery merged several times with other companies, and then in early 2001, the brewery merged with V√≠filfell hf. thus creating the largest company in Iceland in the beverage industry. That company merged with Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP), and operates as Coca-Cola European Partners √çsland ehf. (in Reykjav√≠k, where Coca-Cola is still bottled), while V√≠king is still brewed in Akureyri. Market-share Viking Gylltur was by far the most sold beer in Iceland in 2017, and all of V√≠king's beer has over a quarter of the Icelandic market share (or half of all non-imported beer). Einst√∂k brand The Einst√∂k brand (meaning one of a kind), is separate from Viking, while also bottled in Akureyri, and under CCEP, from the beginning mostly sold abroad. Beer types V√≠king mainly produces lager beers (while their craft beer brands are different). The most popular ones are: * V√≠king Gylltur, 5.6% ABV. * V√≠king Lager, 4.5% ABV. * V√≠king Lite, 4.4% ABV. In addition to the above, the brewery also makes seasonal beers for Christmas, Easter and Summer, as well as some all year round special beers such as Stout and Organic Pils.

Symptoms may include a tremor, increased reflexes, trouble walking, kidney problems, and an altered level of consciousness. Some symptoms may last for a year after levels return to normal. Complications may include serotonin syndrome. Lithium toxicity can occur due to excessive intake or decreased excretion. Excessive intake may be either a suicide attempt or accidental. Decreased excretion may occur as a result dehydration such as from vomiting or diarrhea, a low sodium diet, or from kidney problems. The diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and supported by a lithium level of greater than 1.2 mEq/L. Gastric lavage and whole bowel irrigation may be useful if done early. Activated charcoal is not effective. For severe toxicity hemodialysis is recommended. The risk of death is generally low. Acute toxicity generally has better outcomes than chronic toxicity. In the United States about 5,000 cases are reported to poison control centers a year. Lithium toxicity was first described in 1898.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of lithium toxicity can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild symptoms include nausea, feeling tired, and tremor and occur at a level of 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Moderate symptoms include confusion, an increased heart rate, low muscle and tone and occur at a level of 2.5 to 3.5 mEq/L. Severe symptoms include coma, seizures, low blood pressure and increased body temperature which occur at a lithium concentration greater than 3.5 mEq/L. When lithium overdoses produce neurological deficits or cardiac toxicity, the symptoms are considered serious and can be fatal.Watkins, J. B., Klaassen, C. D., & Casarett, L. J. (2010). Casarett & Doulls essentials of toxicology. Place of publication not identified: McGraw Hill Medical.  Acute toxicity  In acute toxicity, people have primarily gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, which may result in volume depletion. During acute toxicity, lithium distributes later into the central nervous system causing dizziness and other mild neurological symptoms.  Chronic toxicity  In chronic toxicity, people have primarily neurological symptoms which include nystagmus, tremor, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and change in mental status. During chronic toxicity, the gastrointestinal symptoms seen in acute toxicity are less prominent. The symptoms are often vague and nonspecific.  Acute on chronic toxicity  In acute on chronic toxicity, people have symptoms of both acute and chronic toxicity.  Complications  People who survive an intoxication episode may develop persistent health problems. This group of persistent health symptoms are called syndrome of irreversible lithium- effected neurotoxicity (SILENT). The syndrome presents with irreversible neurological and neuro-psychiatric effects. The neurological signs are cerebellar dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms, and brainstem dysfunction. The neuro-psychiatric findings present with memory deficits, cognitive deficits, and sub-cortical dementia. For a diagnosis, the syndrome requires the absence of prior symptoms and persistence of symptoms for greater than 2 months after cessation of lithium. Pathophysiology Lithium is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is distributed to the body with higher levels in the kidney, thyroid, and bone as compared to other tissues. Since lithium is almost exclusively excreted by the kidneys, people with preexisting chronic kidney disease are at high risk of developing lithium intoxication. Lithium toxicity can be mistaken for other syndromes associated with antipsychotic use, such as serotonin syndrome because lithium increases serotonin metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid. There are several drug interactions with lithium. Interactions can occur from typical antipsychotics or atypical antipsyhcotics. In particular, certain drugs enhance lithium levels by increasing renal re-absorption at the proximal tubule. These drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and thiazide diuretics. Diagnosis The diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and supported by a lithium level blood level. Blood levels are most useful six to twelve hours after the last dose. The normal serum lithium level in those on treatment is between 0.6-1.2 mEq/L. Some blood tubes contain lithium heparin which may result in falsely positive results. When lithium toxicity is suspected tests may include: *fingerstick glucose * serum lithium concentration *basic metabolic panel to assess renal function * serum acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations to rule out other sources of acute ingestion *urine pregnancy tests to ensure management does not cause abortion Imaging tests are not helpful.  Treatment  If the person's lithium toxicity is mild or moderate, lithium dosage is reduced or stopped entirely. If the toxicity is severe, lithium may need to be removed from the body. The removal of lithium is done in a hospital emergency department. It may involve: *Gastric lavage. A tube is placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. The tube is used to remove lithium that has not been digested yet. It may also be used to put medicines directly into the stomach to help stop lithium from being absorbed. *Use of an artificial kidney to clean the blood (dialysis). This is usually done only in the most severe cases. *Medications such as furosemide and intravenous normal saline due to appear to be effective in speeding the removal of lithium. People may be sent home once their lithium level is less than 1.5 mEq/L and they have no symptoms.

Graduation from the Penns Valley Area High School requires a student to achieve 54 student learning outcomes. The 54 Learning Outcomes were approved by the Penns Valley Area School Board in August, 1996. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 16% of Penns Valley Area School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.

Through the use of a simple pre-treatment of the sample by the means of specific intercalating photo-reactive reagents it's possible to neutralize the DNA of dead cells. As a result, only DNA from live cells will be detected by PCR. This approach expands a lot the analytical scope of PCR procedures. The capability to detect only living cells become very important, because in key applications is more important to know the amount of live cells, than the total cell level. Examples of this are: food and water quality control, infectious diseases diagnostic, veterinary applications, ecological dynamics... The first referenced work about this analytical approach was in 2003, Norwegian researchers suggest the use of Ethidium Monoazide, an azide form of Ethidium Bromide, which was used in other analytical fields as Flow Cytometry as a candidate for viability PCR. However, the main important advances were done by Nocker and colleagues, which demonstrated in successive works the potential of this technology and also suggested Propidium monoazide as a better reagent for vPCR. This field still is on development, from 2003 up to 2015, the scientific evidences about the applicability of vPCR are stacking, nowadays main efforts are focused in procedure optimization. Since a simple reagent mix with the sample, photo-activation and subsequent PCR not always shows expected results, each procedure needs some optimization. Up to now the main improvements has been : \\\\- Improving the efficiency of photo activation: early procedures were based on high power halogen lamps which overheated the samples and don't ensured constant light dose, these home made solutions have been replaced by led based instruments. \\\\- The use of long PCR aplicons as targets. \\\\- The increase of temperature during dark incubation. Through combining different optimizations strategies and controlling the analytical bias, nowadays the vPCR becomes a powerful analytical tool.

This theme have these specific characteristics: one or two survivors, blood crying statue, and the whole city along with its citizens were sinking. The survivor(s) was being saved by the gods because of his/her benevolent acts; may be an old lady or a devoted son. The blood crying statue was often a stone lion statue, or sometimes tortoise statue. This theme is often confused with another flood theme which greatly increase the sunken area from a city into the whole world. Records of Searching for Spirits Records of Searching for Spirits () is a collection of stories from the 4th century CE which was compiled by Gan Bao from East Jin Dynasty. This literature contains two versions of the legend of the sunken city, each in Chapter 13 and 20. The story from Chapter 20 tells of a benevolent old woman who is told that her city would be sunk after the eyes of the tortoise statue in her city turned red. Every day she checked its eyes, until one day a naughty child colored the eyes red. The old woman, with the help of a dragon, escaped the city just before the city sank beneath the water and become a lake. Buddhist version Once in a dark times, most people did not believe in Buddha and the gods anymore. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva turned himself into a beggar to find the last pious person. He found an old lady praying to the gods who gave him half of the rice which was intended for offering. The Bodhisattva told the lady that her hometown would be sunk after the lion statue's eyes in her city turned red. She passed the warning to other citizens but was laughed at. They secretly painted the statue's eyes red as a prank for the old lady, who was shocked and once again warned the citizens. The people of the city laughed at her and, realising that she could not convince them, the old woman climbed a nearby mountain. After she reached the top, she turned her head just to find her whole city had sunk under the water and wept bitterly. Nanyang (1982) In 1982, the people from Nanyang, Henan still recall the legend of a brother and sister who frequently played with an iron lion statue in the front of a temple. One day, a monk told the older sister to give the lion a steamed bun every day and warned her to check its eyes. If the eyes turned red, she and her brother were to climb into the lion's belly. One day the sister found the statue's eyes red. She called her little brother and they both climbed into the lion's belly not long before the sky turned dark and the wind blew hard. After the sky was clear, they climbed out and found that \\"the sky had fallen\\" while everyone in the village had died. They brought with them the steamed buns from inside the lion's belly and searched for another survivors until they found an old woman on the top of the mountain. Both brother and sister asked the old woman what should they do next; the old woman advised that each of them should roll a part of a millstone from the top of the mountain. If the millstone landed on top of each other as it should be, they should marry and repopulate the world; and the result was so. They had five pair of male and female children, each pairs were married and the world is full with human beings once more. Eight Immortals Eight Immortals \\"The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea\\" comics by Chan Kok Sing told a story about Jade Emperor who was about to punish a city by sinking it because the citizens were sinful. The Eight Immortals tried to stop the plan because there could be virtuous people among the citizens and it would be unfair if they were being drowned with the rest. To save the good people, Li Tie Guai and Han Xiang Zi came down to the city as beggars; the citizens despised them and a woman even threw a cake which was used to clean her baby's feces at them. On the next day, both immortals disguised as oil sellers sold two bottles of oil at half the price of one bottle. The citizens thought them as fools and greedily took the deal.

It is located at 165 The Esplanade, Cairns North, Cairns. The hospital offers general service to Cairns' population of about 155,000 and other nearby communities. The building complex has a 667 space multi-storey car park with a pedestrian overpass linking it to the rest of the hospital. In 2011, a shortage of beds for mental health patients meant some were staying for more than 100 hours in the emergency department.  History  Architectural drawing for the \\"new\\" hospital, 1884 On 3 March 1877, a meeting of residents in Cairns decided to establish a hospital, raising ¬£75 in donations at the meeting and further ¬£35 following the meeting. At that time, the nearest hospital was in Cooktown. In October 1877, the Queensland Government voted to contribute ¬£200 towards a hospital in Cairns. By February 1878, a hospital had been established with a local correspondent describing it as follows: View of the front of the Cairns Hospital and the covered verandahs, 1886 > \\"We have a commodious hospital here, nicely situated on the beach facing the > north, but it seems that Cairns is so healthy that we can't find any inmates > for it.\\" In September 1884, the Queensland Government called for tenders for the construction of a new hospital for Cairns with the contract awarded in November 1883 to H. A. Leisner for ¬£2218. Cairns Hospital after completion, 1914 In 1908 a competition was held for architectural designs of the new Cairns District Hospital. The winner was a two-storey design by Harvey George Draper of Cairns. On 21 August 1910 the foundation stone was laid but it was not until November 1910 that the Queensland Government had negotiated a contract with John Thomas Bulcock to build the new hospital. The hospital was officially opened on 28 July 1912. In September 2016 the 7-member board resigned in September 2016 over failure to recoup an $80 million budget deficit, resulting in the hospital being managed by a single administrator Terry Mehan. Redevelopment In 2015, a $454.6 million redevelopment occurred at the hospital, including the introduction of an additional 168 beds. These works increased the total number of beds to 531. It also increased the number of operating theatres to 11.

Life The Keiths of Aquhorsk descended from Alexander Keith, third son of William Keith, 2nd Earl Marischal. The eldest son of James Keith, he was born in the Old House of Aquhorsk in Marr, near Aberdeen, on 6 November 1752. He took his degree from Marischal College and the University of Aberdeen in 1770, was licensed by the presbytery of Aberdeen on 14 July 1774. Keith was presented by the commissioners for George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, 9 May 1776, to the living of Keith-Hall and Kinkell, Caskieben, Aberdeen. A legal difficulty arose when, the following day, the Earl Marischal himself, then resident in Potsdam, gave a presentation to Thomas Tait, minister of Old Machar. After legal proceedings in the church courts and the court of session, the case was finally decided in Keith's favour by the House of Lords in April 1778 and he was ordained to the living on 14 May 1778. He received the degree of D.D. from Marischal College in May 1803. He was translated from Keith-Hall to Tulliallan, Perthshire, by George Keith Elphinstone, Viscount Keith, and admitted on 18 July 1822. Keith was an active minister who cultivated his glebe to support his family. He died at Tulliallan House on 7 March 1823, aged 70, and was buried in the churchyard of Keith-Hall, his old parish. A tablet of white marble was erected to his memory by Aberdeenshire gentry. Works Keith's major work was General View of the Agriculture of Aberdeenshire, London, 1811, for the Board of Agriculture surveys. In an appendix are Observations on British Grasses, and a Short Account of Two Journeys undertaken with a View to ascertain the Elevation of the principal Mountains in the Division of Marr. Other publications were: * Sermons and Discourses on several Occasions, London, 1785. * Tracts on Weights, Measures, and Coins, London, 1791. * Tracts on the Reform of the British Constitution, Edinburgh, 1793. * An Impartial and Comprehensive View of the Present State of Great Britain, London, 1797. A humorous appendix gives an allegorical representation of parts of the inquiry, as Sketches of the History of John Bull, Farmer and Manufacturer. * Observations on the Sale of Corn by Weight, Aberdeen, 1797. * Address ‚Ä¶ respecting Chapels of Ease, n.p. 1797 (anon.) * Dissertation on the Excellence of the British Constitution (Blackwell prize dissertation), Aberdeen, 1800. * Particular Examination of the new French Constitution, Aberdeen, 1801. * Embarrassments affecting the Interests of Agriculture, Aberdeen, 1823. Keith wrote the account of Keith-Hall and Kinkell for Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scotland (1791). He edited the Lectures on Ecclesiastical History by his friend George Campbell, with a memoir (1800). He published also sermons and addresses. Weights and measures Keith investigated methods for equalising weights and measures, and supported the adoption of the seconds pendulum as a standard. His plan was put before a committee of parliament in January 1790 by Sir John Riggs Miller, who intended to bring in a bill on the subject; but the dissolution of parliament intervened. Sir Joseph Banks praised Keith's pamphlet Synopsis of a System of Equalization of Weights and Measures of Great Britain 1791. In 1817 Keith published Different Methods of establishing an Uniformity of Weights and Measures, London. Malt tax In 1798 Keith gave evidence before the Scottish distillery committee of the House of Commons on the malt tax, an excise duty. In 1799, at the request of the committee and of the Scottish board of excise, he made a series of experiments in distillation; his results were printed in the appendix to the committee's report, 1798‚Äì9. He made further experiments in 1802‚Äì3 for the commissioners of excise in Scotland. In 1803 Keith again gave evidence before a committee of the House of Commons on the proportion of the malt tax levied in England and Scotland, and in 1804 he took part in a discussion on distilling experiments which had been made for the Scottish commissioners.Keith's papers on the malt tax in Farmers' Magazine, Edinburgh, 1804 pp. 49‚Äì73, and 1807 pp. 360‚Äì6, 476‚Äì500; Parliamentary Papers, 1806, ii. 3 seq.). The House of Commons voted Keith ¬£500 for his experiments. In 1800 Keith drew up the heads of a new corn bill, which was passed to the corn committee of the House of Lords by Sir William Pulteney. Family Keith married, on 26 August 1783, Helen, daughter of James Simpson, merchant, of Old Meldrum. She died on 8 January 1798. They had four sons and three daughters. *The eldest son, James, born on 18 January 1788, became colonel in the British army, and died during the retreat from Cabul on 19 October 1839. *Alexander, born on 13 November 1792, is known as a writer on biblical prophecy. *John, born on 7 May 1797, was ordained assistant and successor at Keith-Hall on 3 May 1821, and succeeded to the charge on his father's translation.

In 1913 he worked for the New Statesman for a few months. First World War Around August 1914, West tried to obtain a commission in the British Army but was refused on the grounds that he was a Russian citizen. He argued that his parents, who were Russian, had only been visiting Russia when he was born, but it made no difference. He attempted to become a naturalised British citizen but it is unclear if he succeeded. The British authorities told him that if he wanted to fight he would have to join the Russian army who were allied to the British in the war. This he would not do as he considered himself English and his Russian was poor. He was, however, allowed to join an ambulance corps in London.

The couple wished to marry urgently as West was soon to travel to Russia but, according to the priest who officiated, the so-called \\"pacifist bishop\\" Edward Hicks, Giles's mother and sister were \\"vehement feminists\\" who wished to omit the word \\"obey\\" from the marriage vows while West's father would not attend the ceremony if they did. A compromise was reached whereby \\"obey\\" and \\"giving away\\" were omitted and West's father remained in the vestry. Towards the end of 1914, he travelled to Petrograd, Moscow, and Warsaw as a correspondent. On his return to England he wrote and edited Everyman. After his wife died in early 1917, he travelled again to Russia for the start of the Bolshevik regime where he experienced famine conditions in Petrograd which affected his already poor health.Katanka, Michael (Ed.)

Personal life Ahmet Burak Erdoƒüan was born in Istanbul on 4 July 1979, the son of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and his wife Emine Erdoƒüan, and educated at ƒ∞mam Hatip school. He has a bachelor's degree from Istanbul Bilgi University. As with all his siblings, his higher education was paid for by Remzi G√ºr, a Turkish textile entrepreneur and friend of the Erdoƒüan family. In 1998, the Turkish classical music singer Sevim Tan√ºrek died in Istanbul after a period in intensive care after being hit by a car driven by Erdoƒüan, who reportedly did not have a driving licence and fled the scene. Erdoƒüan ultimately received no punishment. Following the accident involving Tan√ºrek, he left Turkey to study economics in London. In 2001, Erdoƒüan married Sema Ketenci, the daughter of Osman Ketenci. Career He bought a shipping company together with Mustafa Erdoƒüan and Ziya ƒ∞lgen in 2006 and they named it Bumerz. In 2007 Erdoƒüan co-founded the shipping company MB Denizcilik together with Mecit √áetinkaya, who as well owns the sea freight company Manta Denizcilik. In November 2013, MB bought a sixth ship, Pretty, built in China for over $20 million and with a capacity of 91,000 tons, to add to the existing five ships, Safran 1, Sakarya, G. ƒ∞nebolu, Cihan and Bosna that it owns. The acquisition of Pretty almost doubled the company's shipping capacity. In 2013, Ynetnews reported that one of MB's ships, 95-metre Safran-1 had travelled several times between Turkish and Israeli ports despite the poor relations between the two countries, and that in the Turkish Parliament, opposition MPs had asked his father: \\"Has your son been exempted from the trade embargo against Israel? Is it ethical? What share of the volume of trade with Israel did the ship owned by your son take?\\" Ynetnews noted that no formal trade embargo had existed at the time, except for arms sales. In 2015, Aydƒ±nlƒ±k reported that Erdoƒüan now owned 99% of MB (with √áetinkaya owning the other 1%) and that MB owned tankers worth US$80 million.

First version, gouache on paper, 1888, . Nationalmuseum, Stockholm En premi√§r (Swedish for \\"A Premi√®re\\" or \\"The First Time\\", sometimes known by its French title Une Premi√®re) is an artwork by Swedish artist Anders Zorn, with several versions created from 1888 to 1895. The work was one of several works in which Zorn depicted woman bathing outdoors, a genre he described as \\"naked studies in the open\\" (\\"nakenstudier i det fria\\"). In this composition, a nude woman holding a small child at the edge of the water beside a beach. Different versions are held by the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, the Ateneum in Helsinki, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent.  Background  Zorn was born in Mora, Sweden, between the lakes of Siljan and Orsasj√∂n. He studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm from 1875 to 1880, and then spent time travelling in Europe, painting watercolours and society portraits in London, Paris and Madrid. He married (n√©e Lamm) in 1885. After time travelling, they settled at near Mora, now the home of the Zorn Collections. Zorn spent some time in 1887 and 1888 painting watercolours of naked people enjoying the water at the seaside resort of Dalar√∂, before moving to Paris to exhibit works there in 1889. Description The painting depicts a summer bathing scene. Two people, a mother with an infant boy, are both standing naked near the edge of a large body of water. The mother is holding the arms of the child as they enter the water to bathe or swim. The title may indicate that the scene represents the child's first swimming lesson. At that time, paintings of naked women were controversial outside a mythological setting, and bathing in the sea was banned in the Swedish archipelago. Nonetheless, Zorn created five version of the work, the original large watercolour in 1888, three oil paintings - two large and one small - and a small etching from 1890. The first three versions were made in 1888, starting with a watercolour or gouache on paper, which measures . This version was a great success when exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, where Zorn won a medal. He won three medals at the Paris Salon that year, two for portraits (a watercolour of the dancer Rosita Mauri, and an oil painting of the journalist Antonin Proust who was serving as Minister of Fine Arts and President of the Exposition) and one for his oil painting of three women bathing, Ute (Outdoors). Zorn was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. The watercolour was later donated to the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm by Friends of Art through Richard Bergh in 1915. Zorn also made two oil paintings of the same subject in 1888: a large oil on canvas version, measuring , which has been in the collection of the Ateneum in Helsinki since 1922, and a second smaller oil on canvas version, measuring , which is in a private collection. The fourth version is a small etching from 1890, which has dimensions of , in which the scene is largely delineated by many diagonal lines. The etching exists in four states, and includes a beach strip at the foreground with tall reeds behind the human figures. It is believed that the first gouache version originally had a similar composition but was cropped after the Paris Exhibition. Zorn later became unhappy with his original 1888 watercolour version, and tore it up in 1894-95, leaving marks that are visible in its current condition. It was rescued from destruction by . Zorn intended to replace the watercolour with a new and better version. This version was his fifth, the second full size version and third oil painting, which measures . This version was entitled Met moeder (With Mother) and completed in 1895. It is in the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, Belgium. Similar works Zorn made several other works depicting women bathing around 1888. Other examples include the oil painting Ute (Outdoors), held by Gothenburg Museum of Art, with an 1890 copy held by the Ateneum Art Museum in Helsinki; and his 1890 oil painting The Morning Toilet (also known as With His Mother) shows a mother and son entering the water from a rocky shoreline, viewed from a wider angle, and is held by the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; a similar etching With Her Child followed in 1890.

Incorporated in 1764, the town center is composed of a small cluster of civic and commercial buildings at School and Main Streets, with some residential properties radiating away. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, the district abuts the Gorham Campus Historic District, the historic core of the campus of the University of Southern Maine. Description and history The town of Gorham is located northwest of Portland, Maine, inland from the coast of southern Maine. The town's early settlement began in the 1730s, but it did not grow significantly until the 1750s. By then, the area that is now the center had begun to take shape, with School Street (Maine State Route 114) running north-south, and Main Street (United States Route 202) running east-west, accompanied by a small grid of side streets. The only surviving 18th-century buildings in the town center are the First Congregational Church (1797), and a 1760s house that was moved into the center area in the 1830s. The remaining buildings were built mostly in the 19th century, in a variety of styles. The town's growth was influenced by the founding of Gorham Academy, which opened in 1806, and whose campus, located immediately northwest of the center, is now home to the University of Southern Maine. Most of the buildings in the district are residential houses built of wood; there are a few prominent brick commercial buildings located on School Street and at its junction with Main Street. The district is roughly L-shaped, extending from the junction of School and Main north and west, including properties on the north side of Main Street between School and Academy Streets, on the south side of College Avenue between those two streets, and along School Street from Main to a point a short way north of Church Street. It covers about , and includes 42 buildings, all of which are historically significant.

Campany, said that this subject gave a notion of the Taoist belief, that \\"over vast eras\\", geological change will turn the ocean into land and vice versa. This term is often used in Chinese literature and poetry, for example in Zuo Zhuan, which is about the death of Duke Jing of Jin and mentions the \\"Shaman of Mulberry Fields\\" ().In this case, sƒÅngti√°n can be a name or a place. Along with the \\"blue seas\\" phrase, since the Han dynasty, these two phrases were combined into an idiom that has meaning about changes and changing. The mathematics book shush√π j√¨y√≠ Êï∞ÊúØËÆ∞ÈÅó (shush√π j√¨y√≠) by Xu Yue, from the Han dynasty, mentioned an idea about the turning of blue seas into mulberry fields. Yan Zhenqing, in his literature Magu Shan Xiantan Ji (Áó≤ÂßëÂ±±‰ªôÂ¢∞Ë®ò), wrote that on the high tops of Mount Magu there could still be found clam and oyster shells, and he also mentioned the gardens and fields which once were under the water. The blue sea turned into mulberry fields \\"The blue sea turned into mulberry fields\\" (; fig. \\"the transformations of the world\\") appears in the hagiograph works of Ge Hong, i.e. \\"Shenxian zhuan\\". The idiom is given in four characters, each having its own meaning: Ê≤ß \\"blue, dark green; cold\\"; Êµ∑ \\"sea, ocean; maritime\\"; Ê°ë \\"mulberry tree; surname\\"; Áî∞ \\"field, arable land, cultivated\\". This idiom can also be interpreted as \\"time will bring a great change into the world\\" or \\"everything will be change in time\\". When the immortal Wang Yuan invited Magu to come to his house for a feast, after the food was being served, Magu said: Wang drew a long breath and said: Blue seas where once was mulberry fields \\"Blue seas where once was mulberry fields\\" () was written on the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian. The idiom can be interpreted as \\"the time will bring great changing\\" or \\"the wheel of fate is spinning\\".

The party was revived for a short time during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and after the end of communism in 1989‚Äì90. History Despite the fact that the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) won a sweeping victory in the November 1945 parliamentary election, the party was forced to enter a coalition with the left-wing parties, including M√°ty√°s R√°kosi's Hungarian Communist Party (MKP), which was the only kind of government acceptable to the Soviet-dominated Allied Control Commission (SZEB) led by Marshal Klement Voroshilov. The FKGP's gains were gradually whittled away by the Communist R√°kosi's salami tactics. At first the right-wing branch of the FKGP became the first victims of the Communist pressure. Dezs≈ë Sulyok and his supporters were forced out of their party on 10 March 1946. Fifteen expelled party members founded a new party called the Hungarian Freedom Party on 15 March 1946. The Allied Control Commission has taken note and allowed the foundation on 24 July 1946. Dezs≈ë Sulyok was elected leader of the Freedom Party, Bela Halter as Secretary General, while Vince Nagy and Istv√°n V√°s√°ry became deputy leaders. Several prominent politicians, such as Dezs≈ë Pattanty√∫s-√Åbrah√°m and Gy≈ëz≈ë Drozdy also joined the party. Sulyok presented the party‚Äôs programme on 24 July. The cornerstones of the programme were maintaining neutrality and independence of Hungary, and ensuring the democratic rights and principles of parties. There was increased friction between the Freedom Party and Smallholders' Party as the latter was increasingly becoming controlled by the Communists, who accused the Freedom Party with \\"fascist and reactionary\\", however Sulyok's group distanced themselves from the previous Horthy era and the Arrow Cross Party government, in addition to strong opposition to the proletarian dictatorship. The Hungarian Freedom Party became the most diligent opponent to the Soviet influence, trying to shed light on the antidemocratic actions of the Communist Party. In the summer of 1947, in the presence of Soviet arms, Hungary prepared for a new election. Upon the result of the peer pressure of the pro-Soviet Left Bloc parties, the parliament made further steps away from the Western democracies and towards a Soviet-type system that elections were held. They took place on the basis of a new electoral law (called \\"Lex Sulyok\\"), which excluded about 466,000 people (almost a tenth of the electorate) from the vote on grounds of membership in the \\"pre-war fascist parties\\". Thus Dezs≈ë Sulyok and most of the Freedom Party leadership, who formerly members of the governing national conservatist Unity Party then Party of National Unity, which parties claimed by the Communists as \\"fascist and reactionary\\"), were unable to participate in the 1947 parliamentary election. Protesting against the new election law, the Freedom Party dissolved itself on 21 July 1947. Several leading members, including Sulyok, Halter and Nagy fled the country and emigrated, while others retired from the politics or joined other parties, such as Hungarian Independence Party (MFP) and Independent Hungarian Democratic Party (FMDP). Short-lived refoundations During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which has enabled a temporary multi-party system, Dezs≈ë Pattanty√∫s-√Åbrah√°m initiated the refoundation of the Hungarian Freedom Party on 1 November 1956. J√≥zsef V√°s√°ry, B√©la Haray, Imre Mikl√≥s and Gy√∂rgy K√°lm√°n Szilviusz also involved in the party. Its programme emphasized Hungary's neutrality and non-alignment. Following the Soviet invasion on 4 November, the party ceased to function. The party revived again during the transitional process to democracy under the name Freedom Party (SZP) by members of the right-wing Hungarian emigration group in the United States. The initiative came into existence in New Brunswick, New Jersey on 18 May 1989 and established as a party on 12 July 1989 in Hungary. The SZP ruled that former members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) were excluded from joining the party. After an interim presidency of physician Gyula Gueth, the first congress of the party elected the Hungarian-American Ern≈ë H√≥ka as leader of the SZP. 1956 revolutionist and freedom fighter √ñd√∂n Pongr√°tz also joined the party. The party headquarters were in New York City and Kaposv√°r. The SZP accepted a strong anti-communist programme and demanded the immediate resignation of the reformist communist Mikl√≥s N√©meth cabinet. The party marginalized due internal conflicts by end of 1989, thus its application for admission to the Hungarian Round Table Talks was refused. The Freedom Party could run only five individual candidates in the 1990 parliamentary election and set up two regional county lists (Somogy and Zala).Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. The SZP received 0.06 percent of the votes and gained no seats. The SZP split into two factions under the leaderships of Gyula Gueth and Ferenc Torda on 15 August 1992, when the latter one founded a new organization called Hungarian Freedom Party. The SZP made a short-lived electoral alliance with the J√≥zsef Torgy√°n-led Independent Smallholders' Party on 28 November 1992, but soon it left the alliance because they were not given guaranteed seats on the FKGP's national list for the 1994 parliamentary election. The SZP did not contest neither in 1994 nor 1998, it became technically defunct by March 1999, when the Somogy County Court abolished the organization.

The islands had a very high number of German soldiers compared to the civilian population, one soldier for every 2-3 civilians, which reduced options; this linked to the severe penalties imposed by the occupiers meant that only forms of non-lethal resistance were used by the population. Even so, over twenty civilians died for resistance against the occupiers. Plaque: \\"During the period of the German occupation of Jersey, from 1 July 1940 to 9 May 1945, many inhabitants were imprisoned for acts of protest and defiance against the Occupation Forces in H.M. Prison, Gloucester Street which stood on this site. Others were deported and held in camps in Germany and elsewhere from which some did not return.\\" Background Map showing the location of the Channel Islands, close to the French coast. From the British declaration of war on Germany in September 1939 until May 1940, a number of Channel Islanders had left to volunteer for the armed forces in Britain or to work in associated war industries, whilst British people came to the Channel Islands on holiday. On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg (Lightning War) tactics took the Western powers by surprise. By the time of the resignation of the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the Battle of France was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and to keep the Government functioning. On the 15th of June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended. The Germans were not informed however. Evacuation boats for civilians only became available on the 20th of June and again, to stop a panic, people were still told to remain where they were and that only women and children should be taken. Only when the Lieutenant Governors of the islands evacuated were the recommendation relaxed. The last official ships sailed on 23 June. In total 17,000 from Guernsey, 6,600 from Jersey and all the 1,400 on Alderney travelled to England. The size of the evacuation inevitably reduced the pool of potential active resistors in the Islands once the Germans landed and began their occupation on 30 June 1940. German occupation authorities The German occupation administration in the Channel Islands reported to Paris, the headquarters of Army Group A where two branches, the Verwaltungsstab for civilian matters and the Kommandostab who dealt with military matters, controlled occupied France. The German military Police, the Feldgendarmerie (Field Police) were in operation on both Islands. Their line of reporting was directly to the Field Commander in each Island and dealt with all crimes as well as routine traffic control and guarding installations. They formed working relationships with the civilian policemen as their scope of operations frequently overlapped. The Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police) were tasked with detecting sabotage and subversion and reported to the SS. Aside from the various security forces, a large number of German troops were also garrisoned in the Islands. In October 1944, there were 12,000 soldiers in Jersey and 13,000 in Guernsey. This should be compared to the civilian populations of 39,000 in Jersey and 23,000 in Guernsey: ratios of 1:3 and 1:2. By comparison, there were a mere 100,000 Germans in the whole of the German-zone in France in December 1941, responsible for a population of over 25 million (a ratio of 1:250), although the ratio later reduced to around 1:80. Over 17,000 private houses were used for billeting German soldiers in 1942. Growth of Resistance Demographics In July 1940, the few military personnel trapped on the Islands were identified and sent to POW camps. A year later, all trained army officers in the Islands, many being retired British people who would be deported from the Islands to Germany in 1942, or were Islanders who had served in World War I, many of these holding positions of authority in the Island Governments were identified. What was left were elderly veterans and civilian men and women, with no weapons or communications with Britain to give guidance. Scholar Louise Willmot said that the percentage of the population actively resisting German occupation in other European countries was 0.6 to 3 percent and that the percentage of the islander population participating in acts of active resistance was comparable. From a wartime population of 66,000 in the Channel IslandsWillmot, Louise, (May 2002) The Goodness of Strangers: Help to Escaped Russian Slave Labourers in Occupied Jersey, 1942-1945,\\" Contemporary European History, Vol. 11, No. 2, p. 214. Downloaded from JSTOR. a total of around 4,000 islanders were sentenced for breaking laws (around 2,600 in Jersey and 1,400 in Guernsey), although many of these were for criminal acts rather than resistance; 570 prisoners were sent to continental prisons and camps, and at least 22 persons from Jersey and 9 from Guernsey did not return. Willmott estimated that over 200 people in Jersey provided material and moral support to escaped forced workers, including over 100 who were involved in the network of safe houses sheltering escapees. Organisation The British government had ordered the Islands leaders and crown officers to remain in the Islands and do their duties in the interest of the inhabitants. The British government had further demilitarised the Islands in late June 1940 and did little or nothing to foster or help any form of resistance in the Islands. Resistance efforts were rarely organised, those that were, were organised through the traditional social networks of the Islands; the absence of political parties and the weakness of trade unions meant that political networks that facilitated resistance in other countries were lacking in the Channel Islands. Patriotic pride was bound up more in survival than in imagery of resistance. Some individuals who were later eligible for awards from the Soviet Union for their help towards Soviet prisoners were reluctant to participate in what they considered propaganda. Personal contacts between fugitive prisoners and the families that had helped them were in some cases maintained after the war despite the Cold War and the barriers to communication. Communists and conscientious objectors, groups regarded with disdain by many Islanders, were among those who identified with and sympathised with fugitive workers. Others sympathised on compassionate grounds; some offering help in the way they hoped members of their own family caught up in the war might be treated by others wherever they might be. Some saw helping fugitives as the only practical way of defying the Germans in the face of obstacles to more active forms of resistance. In other occupied countries, those who sheltered victims of Nazism were generally offering help to local deserters from forced service and Jews ‚Äì mostly their friends, neighbours, family, or people from the same social milieu. With so few Jews in the community, and the forced labour situation being different, in the Channel Islands those who helped fugitives were generally harbouring strangers with whom they did not share a language. Norman Le Brocq of the Jersey Communist Party (JCP) led a resistance group called Jersey Democratic Movement (JDM). The resistance helped many of the Soviet forced labourers that the Germans had brought to the island. JDM, the JCP and Transport and General Workers‚Äô Union distributed propaganda. With the aid of a German deserter, Paul Mulbach, they apparently had some success in turning the soldiers of the garrison against their masters, including most notably the highest military authority in the Islands, Huffmeier. There is some evidence to suggest that they had even set a date for this mutiny (1 May 1945) but that it was rendered pointless by the suicide of Adolf Hitler. Peter Tabb suggests that they were involved in the blowing up of the Palace Hotel and of separate ammo dumps, in actual fact it is more likely that their involvement was to set fire to the hotel, and the German efforts to put out the subsequent blaze by using dynamite to create a breach between the flames were misjudged and set off charges in a neighbouring ammo dump. Nevertheless, the JCP do seem to have made many plans for organised resistance.Tabb, A Peculiar Occupation, (Jersey 2005) Escapees A total of 225 islanders, such as Peter Crill, escaped from the islands to England or France: 150 from Jersey, and 75 from Guernsey. A high number of people drowned or failed to escape and were captured. Five boats left Guernsey the day after the occupation started. The number of escapes increased after D-Day, when conditions in the islands worsened as supply routes to the continent were cut off, the desire to join in the liberation of Europe increased and the route shortened. Gorey: \\"Captain Ed Clark, Lieutenant George Haas escaped on 19 January 1945. This tablet was unveiled on the 50th anniversary of this event by Sir Peter Crill KBE, Bailiff of Jersey.\\" In May 1942, three youngsters, Peter Hassall, Maurice Gould, and Denis Audrain, attempted to escape from Jersey in a boat (Audrain drowned, Hassall and Gould were imprisoned in Germany, where Gould died). Following this escape attempt, restrictions on small boats and watercraft were introduced and after each attempt, further temporary bans and restrictions and penalties were imposed. Some escapees carried information on the Islands fortifications and the defending forces as well as messages. Successful escapees were debriefed to obtain as much information as possible on conditions in the Islands. One escapee was met by HM Customs and Excise who charged him 10/- import duty on his dinghy. Once the Cherbourg peninsula was in allied control, an \\"easier\\" escape route became possible. Amongst those heading to France were two American officers, Captain Ed Clark and Lieutenant George Haas, who escaped from the prisoner of war camp at St. Helier on 8 January 1945. Assisted by several residents, including Deputy W.J. Bertram of BEM East Lynne, Fauvic, they crossed to the Cotentin Peninsula in a small boat on the night of 19 January 1945. The penalty for anyone caught helping them was death. Forms of resistance Resistance involved passive resistance, acts of minor sabotage, sheltering and aiding escaped slave workers, and publishing underground newspapers containing news from BBC Radio. Penalties if caught could be severe. Resistance started very early in the occupation, a local newspaper published on 1 July 1940 the ‚ÄúOrdre of the Kommandant of the German Forthes in occupation of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Alderney and Sarc‚Äù, using the exact spelling they were given. There were no radio transmitters available to civilians in the islands as transmitters required licences, so all owners were known to the authorities, nor was any attempt made by the British to deliver a radio to the islands. The islands stayed isolated and out of contact with Britain throughout the occupation. Inherent resistance The physical location of the Islands, the loyalty of the Islanders to the British Crown and the fact that it was the only part of \\"British\\" territory that was captured by the German forces, resulted in a strong desire, especially by Hitler himself, to defend and spend excessive amounts of time and energy on the Islands. The \\"Festung\\" books, hand created with coloured drawings for Hitler, showing in great detail the Islands defences are testament to his interest in the Islands. An important military consequence of the occupation and fortification of the Channel Islands was the deployment of very large numbers of German troops and high usage of slave labour relative to the minor amount of military resources and strategic value they held. This became evident in July 1944, shortly after the D-Day landings and the subsequent St Lo breakout. As the Allies simply chose to bypass the Islands, and many of the arguably far more militarily-significant French coastal ports such as St Nazaire, Lorient, Brest, and St Malo as well, all of which Hitler had previously ordered to be defended and held at all costs and consequently all of which were all heavily garrisoned, this meant that well over 100,000 German troops which could otherwise have served to help to defend Occupied France (and subsequently Germany itself), at a time when Germans forces on the Western Front were suffering from a massive shortage of manpower, were tied down in positions which were essentially militarily useless. The German historian Joachim Ludewig estimates from his study of German archival records that in the middle of 1944 the Channel Islands occupation alone was responsible for over 30,000 such misdeployed troops.R√ºckzug (Retreat), Joachim Ludewig, Rombach GmbHm, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1991, Eng. trans. ¬© 2012 The University Press of Kentucky, , pp. 37-41. Around 500 Germans had died in the Channel Islands. Passive resistance Some defiance or passive resistance was very minor and personal to each activist, from crossing a road to avoid meeting a German soldier on a pavement, knocking on a door using the morse code letter V ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢-, breaking a used matchstick into a \\"V\\" shape, to providing a crust of food to a starving forced worker. The Guernsey Evening Press and The Star, subject to censorship from the German authorities, continued to publish, eventually on alternate days given the shortage of materials and staff available. After the Germans temporarily removed the editor of The Star, Bill Taylor, from his position, following an article which they deemed offensive, it was edited by Frank Falla. Falla was a key member of the Guernsey \\"Resistance\\", being involved in the Guernsey Underground News Sheet (which went by the acronym GUNS). GUNS published BBC news, illegally received, typed on a single news sheet using tomato packing paper. According to his memoirs, through strategic placement of stories handed to him by the German authorities in The Star, he allowed islanders to distinguish easily between German news and stories emanating from Guernsey journalists. Falla was eventually betrayed by an Irish collaborator and, along with his peers who helped to produce GUNS, was deported to Germany. Falla survived, though other members of the organisation did not return from Germany. A shortage of coinage in Jersey (partly caused by occupying troops taking away coins as souvenirs) led to the passing of the Currency Notes (Jersey) Law on 29 April 1941. A series of two shilling notes (blue lettering on orange paper) was issued. The law was amended on 29 November 1941 to provide for further issues of notes of various denominations, and a series of banknotes designed by Edmund Blampied was issued by the States of Jersey in denominations of 6 pence (6d), 1, 2 and 10 shillings (10/‚Äì) and 1 pound (¬£1). The 6d note was designed by Blampied in such a way that the word six on the reverse incorporated an outsized \\"X\\" so that when the note was folded, the result was the resistance symbol \\"V\\" for victory.Edmund Blampied, Marguerite Syvret, London 1986 A year later he was asked to design six new postage stamps for the island, in denominations of ¬Ωd to 3d. As a sign of resistance, he cleverly incorporated into the design for the 3d stamp the script initials GR (for Georgius Rex) on either side of the \\"3\\" to display loyalty to King George VI.Cruickshank (1975) Edmund Blampied forged stamps for documents for fugitives. In June 1943 the bodies of two RAF NCO's washed ashore in Jersey, the military funeral attracted large crowds along the route then in November, soon after the sinking of HMS Charybdis and HMS Limbourne on 23 October 1943, the bodies of 21 Royal Navy and Royal Marines men were washed up in Guernsey. The German authorities buried them with full military honours. The funerals became an opportunity for some of the islanders to demonstrate their loyalty to Britain and their opposition to the occupiers: around 5,000 of the 23,000 Islanders attended the funeral, laying some 900 wreaths ‚Äì enough of a demonstration against the Occupation for subsequent military funerals to be closed to civilians by the German occupiers. Every year a commemoration service is held, which is attended by survivors of the action and their relatives, the Guernsey Association of Royal Navy and Royal Marines, Sea Cadets, St John Ambulance Brigade, the Police and the Red Cross and representatives of the Royal Navy. German occupation of Jersey, a stonemason repairing the paving of the Royal Square incorporated a V for victory under the noses of the occupiers. This was later amended to refer to the Red Cross ship Vega. The addition of the date 1945 and a more recent frame has transformed it into a monument. Islanders joined in Churchill's V sign campaign by daubing the letter \\"V\\" (for Victory) over German signs, resulting in the German troops painting their own \\"V\\" signs. \\"V\\" signs went undercover with badges being made from a shilling showing the king's head surmounting a \\"V\\" that could be worn under the lapel and shown to select people; one of the badges was even sold to and worn by a German soldier. Scouting was banned, but continued undercover,Scouting in Occupied Countries: Part Eight as did the Salvation Army after it was banned. The making and concealing of crystal sets expanded when radios were confiscated, taking earphones from public phones and using common objects like metal bedsteads as aerials. One side effect of the occupation and local resistance was an increase in the speaking of local languages (Guern√©siais in Guernsey and J√®rriais in Jersey). As many of the German soldiers were familiar with both English and French, the indigenous languages enjoyed a brief revival as islanders sought to converse without the Germans understanding. Active resistance There was no armed resistance movement in the Channel Islands. This has been ascribed to a range of factors including the demilitarisation of the Islands by the British government in 1940, the physical separation of the islands, the density of troops (up to one German for every two islanders), the small size of the islands precluding any hiding places for resistance groups, and the absence of the Gestapo from the occupying forces. Moreover, much of the population of military age had already joined the British or French armed forces. Minor acts of sabotage, such as cutting a telephone wire, which could be repaired in an hour, would result in collective punishment with men in the area required to stand guard duty for several nights. A breach of the Hague Convention on military law. Marie Ozanne, a Major in the Salvation Army did not agree with the German Order to ban preaching in the open air or to close the \\"Army\\" down, nor did she agree with the inhumane treatment meted out to the workers building the fortifications. Her repeated protests about the prisoners to the German authorities resulted in her imprisonment, she died in April 1943 at the age of 37. Although she achieved little at the time, her show of courage, decency and defiance, suppressed at the time by the Germans, was an example to all. The Reverend Cohu would deliver his sermon in church each week, in which he would add items of news obtained from the BBC to cheer up his flock. He was arrested in the middle of a sermon in March 1943. Shipped to Germany and put in an SS camp, starved, he died in September 1944. Two French Jewish artists, who were also lesbians, Lucille (also known as Claude) Cahun and Suzanne Malherbe, both having failed to register their religions in 1940, produced anti-German leaflets from English-to-German translations of BBC reports, pasted together to create rhythmic poems and harsh criticism. The couple then dressed up and attended many German military events in Jersey, and put the leaflets in soldiers' pockets, on their chairs or ‚Äúhidden‚Äù inside cigarette packets also encouraging soldiers to shoot their officers. Denounced by a neighbour, they were captured by the Germans in late 1944, condemned to death, the intervention of the Jersey Bailiff succeeded in getting the sentence commuted to prison. After curfew one night, two Police constables saw a very drunk German soldier staggering through town, and gave him a quick shove which sent him flying down a steep flight of granite steps. The Police reported a drunk soldier lying on the steps and after an ambulance had taken him away, the policemen were given some cigarettes from a grateful German for helping their comrade. A minor assault on a German soldier could result in 3 months jail and a fine of 2 years salary. Jersey's Medical Officer of Health, Dr Noel McKinstry, a Northern Irelander by birth, was active in providing his own home to shelter fugitives, in providing forged papers and forging statistics in order to be able to issue extra supplies. Officials of the Parish of Saint Helier provided ration cards and identity cards for fugitives. Some individuals taught fugitives English; eventually some fugitives were proficient enough in English to move around and to be able to participate in activities without detection. Miriam Milbourne risked her life to save a rare breed, a small herd of Golden Guernsey goats by hiding them for years. A farmer hid his bull in a haystack for years, only letting it out at night. Because of the small size of the islands, most resistance involved individuals risking their lives to save someone else.Senator is a driving force behind move for international recognition, Jersey Evening Post, 9 March 2010 The British government followed a policy of not encouraging resistance in the Channel Islands. Reasons for this British policy included the fact that resistance within such \\"parochial limits\\" was unlikely to be effective, would be of no direct use to the war effort, and the risk of violent retaliation against British citizens in the Islands was not something the wider British population would be likely to accept (as opposed to the hostage-shootings that were occurring in continental Europe). On 9 March 2010 the award of British Hero of the Holocaust was made to 25 individuals posthumously, including 4 Jerseymen, by the United Kingdom government in recognition of British citizens who assisted in rescuing victims of the Holocaust. The Jersey recipients were Albert Bedane, Louisa Gould, Ivy Forster and Harold Le Druillenec. It was, according to historian Freddie Cohen, the first time that the British Government recognised the heroism of islanders during the German occupation. Public attitudes Attitudes to German rule changed as the Occupation went on. At first, the Germans followed a policy of presenting a non-threatening presence to the resident population for its propaganda value ahead of an eventual invasion and occupation of the United Kingdom. Many Islanders were willing to go along with the necessities of Occupation as long as they felt the Germans were behaving in a correct and legal way. Two events particularly jolted many Islanders out of this passive attitude: the confiscation of radios, and the deportation of large sections of the populations. Listening to BBC Radio had been banned in the first few weeks of the occupation and then (surprisingly given the policy elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe) tolerated for a period before being once again prohibited. In 1942 the ban became draconian, with all radio listening (even to German stations) being banned by the occupiers, a ban backed up by the confiscation of wireless sets. Denied access to BBC broadcasts, the populations of the Islands felt increased resentment against the Germans and increasingly sought to undermine the rules. Hidden radio receivers and underground news distribution networks spread. Nevertheless, many islanders successfully hid their radios (or replaced them with homemade crystal sets) and continued listening to the BBC despite the risk of being discovered by the Germans or being informed on by neighbours.Bunting (1995); Maughan (1980) The regular raids by German personnel hunting for radios further alienated the occupied civilian populations. In September 1941 the British War Cabinet ordered German civilians in Persia to be interned, which was against international law. Hitler in response ordered the internment of British civilians, most of which were to be found in the Channel Islands. 10 British for 1 German and shipped to the Pripet Marshes. The Islands had been ordered to carry out a census, so the Germans knew the place of birth of every Islander. Such a reprisal act was against international law. The Germans in the islands delayed, however in August 1942 Hitler was reminded of the issue by a Swiss trying to arrange an exchange of prisoners for British civilians and reissued his order when he found his initial 1941 order had not been acted upon. The deportations of 2,058 men, women, children and babies in September 1942, which triggered suicides in Guernsey, Sark and Jersey, sparked the first mass demonstrations of patriotism of the Occupation. The illegality and injustice of the measure, which contrasted with the Germans' earlier showy insistence on legality and correctness, outraged those who remained behind and encouraged many to turn a blind eye to the resistance activities of others in passive support. The deportees were sent to camps in Germany, sailing off singing patriotic songs, including There'll Always Be an England and God Save the King. Further resentment was caused by a second deportation of 187 that occurred in early 1943, following a commando raid on Sark, Operation Basalt which resulted in captive German soldiers being killed while trying to escape. The sight of brutality against slave workers brought home to many Islanders the reality of Nazi ideology behind the punctilious fa√ßade of the Occupation. Forced marches between camps and work sites by wretched workers and open public beatings rendered visible the brutality of the r√©gime. The rotation of German soldiers, with first grade men being gradually downgraded until many soldiers were non- German, ex-Russian prisoners appeared in German uniform resulted in a reduction in morals and an increase in crimes, often linked to the soldiers' hunger, including murders. Following the Normandy invasion in June 1944, many changes to attitude occurred, prisoners could no longer be sent to France, similarly, no supplies could be received into the Islands. Both sides realised that the writing was on the wall for Germany and the Island authorities could become less subservient and more demanding in requests, such as the request for Red Cross assistance. The Germans were agreeing to more of these requests. Even Britain changed its attitude, previous requests for Red Cross help being refused with Churchill, on 27 September 1944, writing a note saying: Let them starve. No fighting. They can rot at their leisure. There is little evidence of \\"eleventh hour resistors\\" towards the end of the war, as in other countries. The Islanders had been bypassed by the war, they were tired and very hungry during the winter of 1944‚Äì1945, they knew there was little they could do to help the war effort, so patiently awaited the liberation. Each arrival of the SS Vega gave brief opportunities to celebrate. During April 1945 British flags started to appear, and the public was warned not to aggravate the Germans. The true feelings of Islanders burst out into the open on 9 May 1945 when they were finally liberated There is no doubt that the Islands were an embarrassment to Churchill. His \\"We will fight them on the beaches\\" speech was certainly not taken up in the Channel Islands. However it was the British Government that had abandoned the Islands and declared them neutral territory in June 1940. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth made a special visit to the Islands on 7 June 1945. Retribution Early on in the war, Islanders were given a salutary lesson in resistance. On 28 June 1940 German Heinkel bombers from Cherbourg made an armed reconnaissance, they bombed and strafed the harbours of Saint Peter Port and Saint Helier killing 38 and wounding 45 civilians. On 13 December 1940, sixteen young Frenchmen, soldiers on probation, set out in a boat from occupied Brittany with the intention of joining the Free French forces in England. Failure of navigation skills and rough seas led them to land in Guernsey, thinking it was the Isle of Wight. They landed singing the Marseillaise only to be captured straightaway by German sentries. Six of them were transferred to Jersey for trial, where Fran√ßois Scornet (1921‚Äì1941) was nominated as the ringleader and at a German military trial in the States Building in Jersey was sentenced to death. He was shot by firing squad on 17 March 1941 in the grounds of Saint Ouen's Manor. Plaque on war memorial, Saint Ouen, Jersey, to Louisa Mary Gould, victim of Nazi concentration camp Ravensbr√ºck: Louisa Mary Gould, n√©e Le Druillenec, mise √† mort en 1945 au camp de concentration de Ravensbr√ºck en Allemagne. Louisa Gould hid a wireless set and sheltered an escaped Soviet prisoner. Betrayed by an informer at the end of 1943, she was arrested and sentenced on 22 June 1944. In August 1944 she was transported to Ravensbr√ºck where she died on 13 February 1945. In 2010 she was posthumously awarded the honour British Hero of the Holocaust. Anyone captured for a resistance activity faced prison, sometimes on the Island, however some were sent off Island. For listening to the BBC a sentence of 4 weeks in the local prison followed by deportation to a prison in France and then on to Germany as a forced labourer for years was not unknown. This was mild compared to the SS \\"Nacht und Nebel\\" directive of December 1941, which denounced even a sentence of hard labour for life as a \\"sign of weakness\\", and recommended death or disappearance for any civilian who sought to resist. In July 1941 Colonel Knackfuss issued a notice warning that anyone caught undertaking espionage, sabotage or high treason, the penalty would be death. In addition and more worrying was the notice that in the event of any attacks against communications, such as cutting telephone wires, the Germans would have the right to nominate anyone in the area and give them a death sentence. The highest profile person to be caught was Ambrose Sherwill, President of the Controlling Committee in Guernsey, sent to Cherche-Midi prison in Paris for helping two British soldiers. Lt Hubert Nicolle and Lt James Symes, both Guernsey men, landed in plain clothes to \\"spy\\" on the Germans however they became stranded. His efforts got them treated as PoWs rather than spies. The Germans in France changed the decision and would have had them shot had it not been for the German Commandant in Guernsey who managed to reverse the decision at a \\"Court of Honour\\", as he had given his word regarding their treatment. They were moved to a PoW camp. Harold Le Druillenec, brother of Louisa May Gould, was arrested on 5 June 1944 for trying to help an escaped Russian prisoner of war and having a radio, his sentence took him to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp for ten months and he was the only British survivor from that camp. He commented that: All my time here was spent in heaving dead bodies into the mass graves kindly dug for us by 'outside workers' for we no longer had the strength for that type of work which, fortunately, must have been observed by the camp authorities. Jungle law reigned among the prisoners; at night you killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.

Designed and built by architect Edwin Lutyens around 1900‚Äì3, using a mixture of vernacular and Neo-Georgian architecture, it is a Grade II* listed building. The house was one of Lutyens' first experiments in the addition of classical features to his previously vernacular style,Gradidge (1981), pp. 46‚Äì9. and the introduction of symmetry into his plans.Butler (2003), pp. 31‚Äì6. The gardens, also designed by Lutyens, are Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. House Lutyens designed the house for his mother-in-law, Edith Bulwer-Lytton, the dowager countess of Lytton, and her daughter, the suffragette Constance Lytton.Ridley (2002), pp. 139‚Äì42. It was built at the southern end of Park Wood on the Lyttons' Knebworth estate, about southeast of Knebworth House, using whitewashed brick, weatherboarding and plain tiles. Construction was carried out by the estate builders, to a tight budget. Sources differ on the dates, ranging from 1900,Richardson (1981), p. 193. to 1903. The house's square plan has been compared to Philip Webb's earlier design for Joldwynds, in Surrey. The northwest, entrance front with its three gables is very like that of Joldwynds. The southwest, side elevation has only two gables, however. The southeast, garden front differs radically from Webb. The roof is cut away in the centre to reveal a two-storey, classical facade with Ionic pilasters, creating the appearance of an embedded villa,Amery (1981), p. 85. emerging from the vernacular covering of tiled roofs and elm weatherboarding, which elsewhere around the house come down to the tops of the ground floor windows. The garden front is flanked by two loggias facing each other across a terrace. Other classical touches, on the house's entrance front, include a central, rusticated porch, which has been called Mannerist, and two flanking small pavilions with rusticated piers. The western pavilion contained a darkroom, and the northern one a larder and scullery. There is a small extension on the northeast, service side of the house. The interior is classical, with the rooms laid out compactly on a grid of three by three units. At the centre is a large, well-lit staircase. The centre of the garden front is occupied by the dining room, with large french windows leading onto the terrace. From the entrance front, the porch is entered via an arched door which Lutyens surmounted with an open, unglazed tympanum. This leads into a long passage, with a door on the right giving access to the vestibule. This arrangement produced draughts and helped to make the house cold in the winter; Edith's bedroom gained the nickname \\"Vladivostok\\". The house only had one bathroom.Jenkins (2015), p. 71. After her ordeals in Holloway Prison, Constance's failing health led to a stroke in 1912, and she spent the rest of her life at Homewood with her mother.Jenkins (2015), pp. 195‚Äì6. She died in 1923, only days after moving out of Homewood to a flat in Paddington, London, in an attempt to restart an active life.Jenkins (2015), pp. 228‚Äì30. When Edith died in 1936, the house passed to her son Victor Bulwer-Lytton and in 1947 to his daughter, Hermione Cobbold. In the early 1970s, the Pollock-Hill family bought the house. They have restored it, mostly following Lutyens' plans, but have added some bathrooms.Jenkins (2015), pp. 234‚Äì6. Garden Beyond the house's southeast front with its stone-flagged terrace are yew hedges and flowerbeds, and a lower area of lawn below a retaining wall. There are views to the southeast over farmland towards distant hills. Beyond the southwest elevation is another lawned area and a raised croquet lawn.

Founding  The fund was formed on the initiative of writer and political prisoner Alexander Ginzburg. Families of arrested dissidents often suffered repercussions such as the loss of jobs and opportunities to study. During his time in labor camps, Ginzburg managed to coordinate relatives and friends to help other inmates and their families. This included support such as donating household goods for those in exile, helping relatives who faced expulsion from work, or offering places to stay in Moscow for wives who journeyed to visit their husbands in remote Siberian camps. After his release in 1972, Ginzburg consulted with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn on how to continue this informal support. Solzhenitsyn offered a quarter of his Nobel Prize award for the cause. After Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the USSR in 1974 following the publication of The Gulag Archipelago, he set up a fund in Switzerland, donating all present and future international royalties for the book to it. The funds were from then on brought into the USSR and distributed through a network of volunteers.  Activities  A first goal of the fund was to help gulag inmates and their families to survive. For this, groups of people, unknown to one another, collected information on the existence and whereabouts of political prisoners across the Soviet Union and distributed funds and other material support to them and their families. Other charitable organizations, such as Christian Orthodox organizations that collected clothing and other items, passed those donations onto the Aid Fund for redistribution. The Aid Fund also contributed funds for the support of political prisoners who were sent to psychiatric imprisonment. It paid for the travel expenses of those who traveled to distant trials to support the political dissenters. A second goal of the fund was the support of cultural initiatives, such as a series of memoirs of emigrants. The administrators of the fund ensured that the money was sent legally to banks in Moscow; after the state had taken one third in tax, what remained was distributed in roubles. When the authorities found out about the fund, the receiving of the money was blocked. Instead, donations were sent to friends and sympathisers. The KGB then attempted to halt its distribution by telling the families of political prisoners that, if money were accepted, their loved ones would endure even worse conditions in the camps. According to Solzhenitsyn's wife Natalya, the fund counted up to 120 volunteers.  Post- Soviet Russia  The Aid Fund was revived in the 1990s. It supports impoverished former dissenters. It also instituted a support program for Russian libraries.

Selva, a keyboard player with A. R. Rahman, made his debut as a music director through the film. Production began in mid 2008 and the team initially announced a release in January 2009, but this was not met. The film was entirely shot in Thanjavur, with scenes shot at the bus stand and at SB Nagar Grounds. In March 2012, a City Civil Court suspended the release of the film after a dispute arose of money transaction between the producer and a financier. Petitioner Mohan Kumar, the financier had lent Rs. 25 lakh to assist the producer, Pazhanivel, in the production of the film with a promise that the money should be paid within the stipulated time mentioned in the agreement. But, the producers did not pay the amount in cash instead they produced two cheque leaves to the financier that bounced at the bank for lack of funds in the account. As Mohan Kumar could not get the amount from the producers, he approached the court to stop the film release till the producers pay him the amount. The film faced further troubles when actor Karan complained of non-payment of his salary and when Babu Vishwanath walked out of the film to direct another venture titled Theradi Veethi. The film was later released in March 2013 on a small scale, almost five years after production had begun.

It is a charity that focuses on mammal conservation in Britain and Ireland. Its Head Office is in Herefordshire, with local offices in south- west England, Wales and Ireland.  Background  Vincent Weir was the younger son of Andrew Weir, second Baron Inverforth. He was educated at Malvern College and on leaving school, Vincent joined the family firm, the Andrew Weir Group. In 1975, Vincent established Vincent Wildlife Trust, to focus initially on the status of the otter. Other species the Trust has been or is involved with include the water vole, dormouse, stoat, weasel, polecat, pine marten and the rarer species of bats in Britain, notably the horseshoe bats, Bechstein's bat and barbastelle and in Ireland, the lesser horseshoe bat.  Mammal conservation work   European otter (Lutra lutra)  National otter surveys of England, Scotland and Wales began in 1977, with the VWT covering Scotland. In the 1980s, VWT again surveyed Scotland and also Wales and Ireland. In the early 1990s, the VWT also took over the surveying of England. The surveys relied on searching for otter spraints. The surveys recorded a level of recovery in Britain‚Äôs otter population between the first round of surveys in the late 1970s and the third round in the early 1990s.Jefferies, D.J., Andrews, E.M., Chapman, P.J., Green, J., Green.R. et al (1997). The Otter: Survey, Research and Conservation by the VWT in the 1990s. London. The Vincent Wildlife TrustJefferies, D.J. (1997). The Changing Status of the Otter in the British Isles as revealed by Spraint Surveys. London. The Vincent Wildlife Trust  European water vole (Arvicola amphibius)  The Trust carried out the first and second national water vole surveys in 1989-1990 and 1996-98. These surveys identified the crash in the water vole population in Britain. Following the publication of the first survey, the water vole was given a degree of legal protection in 1998 under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. In 2008, a greater level of protection was given in England and Wales. The long-term decline of the water vole resulted from a loss of habitat and changes in farming practices, but the acceleration in the rate of this decline in the 1980s was down to increasing predation by feral American mink. The status of the water vole is now monitored annually by the PTES through the National Water Vole Monitoring programme and is based on those sites originally surveyed by the trust.  Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Rhinolophus hipposideros)  The Trust became involved in bat conservation in Britain and Ireland in the 1980s, providing information and advice and helping to set up the network of county Bat Groups that still exists today. In 1980, the Trust purchased a farm building in Devon that is now home to the largest maternity colony of greater horseshoe bats in western Europe. Roost acquisition continued over a period of more than 25 years. Today, the trust still manages 40 horseshoe bat roosts in Britain and Ireland and this also includes, in Wales, the largest maternity colony of lesser horseshoe bats in western Europe. Much of the Trust's bat research has focused on the lesser horseshoe bat, including a number of radio-tracking studies. Population studies include detailed surveys of the lesser horseshoe bat in Ireland. In 2008, the trust published The Lesser Horseshoe Bat Conservation Handbook, a practical guide to the management of lesser horseshoe bat roosts.  European polecat (Mustela putorius)  The European polecat population in Britain declined following widespread predator control, particularly in the late 19th century. Today, it has recolonised much of its former range. In order to gauge the extent of this range expansion, the Trust has carried out three national polecat distribution surveys since the 1990s, the most recent of which took place during 2014 and 2015. The Trust has carried out research to further understanding of the ecology of the polecat, including live trapping, radio-tracking, investigation of secondary rodenticide poisoning, and genetic analysis of hybridisation between polecats and ferrets.  European pine marten (Martes martes)  By the early part of the 20th century, the pine marten in Britain was confined to the North-West Highlands of Scotland and isolated pockets of the uplands of northern England and Wales. The Trust has been researching and surveying Britain's pine marten population for 30 years, monitoring the population and developing survey methods, including the use of DNA analysis. In 2015, the Trust's Pine Marten Recovery Project began the translocation of pine martens from Scotland to mid Wales. Twenty martens were translocated in the autumn of 2015 and their progress monitored through an intensive radio-tracking programme. Further translocations took place in 2016 and 2017 bringing the total to just over 50 animals. These animals continue to be monitored using radio tracking, remote cameras and volunteers collecting scats. In summer 2018, the Trust opened a small pine marten information centre close to Devil's Bridge to tell the story of the return of the pine marten to Wales.

All of the songs were written by Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Johnny Burke (lyrics). The songs were featured on a 10‚Äù vinyl LP numbered DL 5444 and in a 3-disc 45rpm box set numbered 9-375. Dorothy Lamour starred in the actual film with Bing and Bob but for the Decca recordings her place was taken by Peggy Lee. LP release Recording dates follow track titles. (all tracks except \\"Moonflowers\\"); All of the songs were subsequently included in a 12‚Äù Decca LP numbered DL4263 issued in 1962 and subtitled ‚ÄúZing a Little Zong‚Äù as part of the Bing‚Äôs Hollywood series. Personnel The orchestra personnel for the June 23 recordings were: Red Nichols (cornet); Frank Zinzer (trumpet); Ted Vesley, Elmer Smithers (trombones); Mahlon Clark (clarinet); Dent Eckles (tenor saxophone); Harry Steinfeld (oboe); Buddy Cole (piano); Perry Botkin (guitar); Larry Breen (string bass); Nick Fatool (drums). Review Crosby biographer Malcolm Macfarlane discussed the songs in his sleeve note for the Sepia Records CD \\"Bing Crosby - Through the Years - vol. 4. TRACK 7 ‚Äì To See You Is to Love You A lovely ballad from Road to Bali with a tasteful string accompaniment. It suits Bing to a tee and he delivers a fine interpretation. In the film, he sings it to Dorothy Lamour and the soundtrack recording was later used in the James Stewart-Grace Kelly movie Rear Window. Dean Martin also sang the song on radio but surprisingly I cannot trace any other recordings of it. TRACK 8 ‚Äì Hoot Mon After the romantic tones of the previous ballad, we come down-to-earth with this Scottish skit which was used to help the plot of Road to Bali along in an amusing way. Whilst it fits into the film, it is surprising that Decca decided to issue a commercial recording of it. Joe Lilley was also the musical director for the film. TRACK 9 ‚Äì Chicago Style A far better song than the last one. A lively jazz backing adds to the fun as Bing and Bob tell of Chester the Trombone King who plays his instrument in a Chicago style. The song was part of a scene in Road to Bali and the amusing antics on screen tended to make one overlook the qualities of the song. Bing sang it on four occasions on his GE show with various female partners. TRACK 10 ‚Äì The Road to Bali It has been said that this song was intended to be a part of an extended scene in the film but this was cut leaving the song to be heard over the opening credits. Again, it is surprising that Decca recorded it for commercial release. Bing and Bob did their best! TRACK 11 ‚Äì The Merry-Go-Run-Around In Road to Bali, Bing and Bob essayed this with Dorothy Lamour but Dottie was not a Decca artist so Peggy Lee was drafted in to take her place. A pleasant enough novelty song put over competently by the vocalists. At least Bing did sing it once on his radio show which is more than he did with ‚ÄúHoot Mon‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Road to Bali‚Äù.

History In August 1918, the North Ipswich Railway Workshops completed an experimental locomotive designed to burn coke instead of coal in an attempt to reduce smoke nuisance caused by coal in Brisbane suburban tunnels. Per Queensland Railway's classification system it was designated the B16 class, B representing that it had three driving axles, and the 16 the cylinder diameter in inches. It was also experimentally built as a 2-6-2 and fitted with Southern valve gear. It was modified to burn coal in June 1927. To provide enough heating surface to generate sufficient steam through its projected use the firebox was made wider for greater burning capacity. The two wheel trailing truck enabled the fitting of a wide firebox, necessary for a coke burning locomotive. The engine was originally fitted with the surplus tender from PB15 N¬∞ 411 after it was converted to a one off member of the 6D15 class. The tender was later changed to a standard C16 class locomotive tender to increase its potential range. The engine spent its working life on the Brisbane to Ipswich line working coal trains. It was withdrawn in February 1950.

Educational programs  The Conservancy provides programs on youth education and nutritional health and cooking. In the Demonstration Kitchen program, participants are provided instruction on cooking with recipes having high nutritional value. The Newark Youth Leadership Project (NYLP) provides training to high school students living in Newark through a year-round internship program. Interns work with staff in the following departments: horticulture, education, farm stand, media, urban farming, and office/accounting. Year-round interns receive training in finance, public speaking, and nutrition.  Urban farming  Greater Newark Conservancy seeks to bolster and support urban farms in Newark, NJ. The urban farms were created with the purpose of offering low-cost and healthy foods in Newark. Participants also have the option of growing their own produce through the Plot-it-Fresh program. In 2011, the Conservancy's urban farms generated 5,000 pounds of produce. The produce is sold in local farmers' markets through Youth Farm Stand - and intern-run produce stand. Crops raised include arugula, beets, garlic, tomatoes, strawberries, and corn. Other related programs include raising chickens and maintaining a honey bee apiary. Schools in Newark, including the Hawthorne Avenue School, have partnered with the Conservancy and FoodCorps service members to provide nutrition education. Students learn to grow produce and how to incorporate those crops into hearty, healthy meals.  New Jersey Reentry Corporation  The Conservancy partners with the New Jersey Reentry Corporation (NJRC) to provide job training and social services to help remove barriers to employment for citizens returning from incarceration. Our relationship began in 2009 with the Clean and Green workforce program. In November 2015, the Conservancy expanded their reach and became a full partner of NJRC. On average, 10-20 participants complete the one-week orientation each week, which allows them to continue to use NJRC's services. The employment rate among participants at the Conservancy is 68%, with an additional percentage involved in meaningful education or training opportunities, such as obtaining their Baccalaureate degrees or a Commercial Driving License (CDL). In stark contrast to the 77% recidivism rate for the State of New Jersey, the statewide recidivism rate for NJRC participants remains at only 19%.  The Prudential Outdoor Learning Center  Educational activities are held primarily at the Judith L. Shipley Urban Environmental Center, the Prudential Outdoor Learning Center, and at its Main education building. Many educational programs take place at the Judith L. Shipley Urban Environmental Center. This center was named after Judith Shipley who along with her husband Walter Shipley, was a major donor to Greater Newark Conervancy. The Prudential Outdoor Learning Center is 1.5 acre site located on Prince Street in Newark and contains a series of outdoor exhibits, thematic gardens, and a small fish pond. It is the former site of the historic Prince Street Synagogue (aka. Congregation Oheb Shalom) and you will see evidence of the building's bustling Jewish community all over the interior and exterior of the building. This center was funded by a bequest from the Prudential Foundation, which is the charity arm of the Prudential Financial Life Insurance Company that is headquartered in Newark, NJ.

She is best known for her work '2.6g 329 m/s', also known as 'Bulletproof Skin', a project to achieve bioengineered bulletproof human skin. This project combined in vitro human skin with spider silk from genetically modified organisms to create a material that stops a slow-speed bullet, yet is pierced by one fired at normal speed. Her more recent project, 'Mestic¬Æ', is a bioplastic and fiber directly derived from manure. The overarching goal of this solution for the excess manure problem is to create a circular economy with cow manure, therefore allowing the agricultural sector to adhere to (inter)national policies while still making it possible for them to keep their investment (cows) and grow. It also generates new sustainable raw materials that can be used by the manufacturing industry. Essa√Ødi is director of Inspidere B.V., a biotech company based in the Bainport region of Eindhoven In 2011, Essa√Ødi founded the BioArt Laboratories Foundation, a foundation that offers citizens access to a creative hybrid laboratory and the tools and knowledge of the life sciences.

After an initial role as a troop ship, she was deployed on service in March 1920 for the railway company to the Channel Islands. In 1923, the TSS Lorina was acquired by the Southern Railway. On 27 August 1927 when leaving Guernsey she collided with a motor fishing boat in St Peter Port. The fishing boat sank within two minutes and one of the fishermen drowned. On 23 October 1935 she struck the Platte Rock near St Helier harbour but there were no casualties. When the war started Lorina quickly pressed into service as a transport & was called from Southampton to Dover after Operation Dynamo began. She was dive-bombed and sunk on 29 May 1940 off Dunkirk by Luftwaffe aircraft during the Dunkirk evacuation with the loss of eight crew. Two days later the wreck was boarded by men from the destroyer HMS Winchelsea who lowered undamaged lifeboats from the Lorina's davits and used them to ferry troops from the beaches.
