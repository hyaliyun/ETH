The medieval building was rebuilt in the 17th century apart from the tower. History In 1125 (40 years after the Reconquista) it was cited as a parish following the Latin Rite (rather than the Mozarabic one). It is thought that the building could have originally been a mosque, based upon its layout and a preceding courtyard, which was later used as a cemetery. One of the first churches in Toledo, it retains a tower of Umayyad architecture. It has a square base and a masonry body a pointed round arch on each side of the tower, framed with a Moorish panel, and brickwork for the corners and rows. When the church was rebuilt the free-standing tower was incorporated in the building. Between 1612 and 1613, the church was rebuilt by Juan Bautista Monegro, based upon the design by Juan de Ordu√±a and at the expense of Don Carlos Venero y Leyba, canon of Toledo. The original building, in bad disrepair, was razed, except for the medieval tower, which was not attached to the church building. The new building is larger, with a longer main chapel, the addition of two sacristy rooms. The city gave Don Carlos Venero an alley that was attached to the main chapel. Two chapels were opened at the beginning of the nave. The one on the side of the epistle has a private sacristy. In 1662, a room dedicated to Virgin of Hope of Macarena was built off the main chapel.

The hillfort is located in the parish of Elsted and Treyford, in Chichester District.Historic England 2015. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument with a list entry identification number of 1015915. The hilltop enclosure is dated to the Late Bronze Age, from the 8th to 6th centuries BC.Historic England 2017. The hillfort defences were renewed during the Late Iron Age. The fort extends approximately east-west by approximately north-south, and covers an area of approximately . Archaeological investigations of the hillfort took place from 1948 to 1952, and from 1976 to 1977. Cross dykes on neighbouring hills are considered to be outlying defences associated with the fort. As well as the Bronze Age remains, the area of the fort also includes an Anglo-Saxon burial mound, and the foundations of a late 18th-century telegraph station. Description The hillfort is situated on the top of the hill and is defined by a single rampart and a flat-bottomed ditch,Dyer 2001, p. 175. which survives as a low bank up to wide. The rampart was originally faced with timber, with timber palisades acting as retaining walls on both the inside and the outside.Cunliffe 1995, p.30. The rampart infill was built with a mixture of soil and chalk, and is best preserved on the south side. On the east and west sides, erosion has reduced the rampart to a scarp, with the ditch silted in to form a terrace. The enclosure is roughly rectangular, with an entrance on the west side.Historic England 2017. Dyer 2001, p. 175. Excavations of the west entrance revealed that a large timber gate was built within the entrance causeway, and uncovered two penannular gold rings (incomplete or unclosed rings). It is possible that there was a second entrance on the northeast side, where a modern track crosses the rampart. Investigation of the interior revealed a general lack of features except for traces a number of small four- and six-posted structures.Cunliffe 2006, p. 156. Historic England 2017. These are interpreted as having been raised granaries. Related monuments Cross dykes on Pen Hill, immediately to the east of the fort Within the enclosure is a small bowl barrow which measured approximately high and measures approximately across. This burial mound has been destroyed by modern ploughing. It stood in the southeastern corner of the fort; excavation in 1976 uncovered a burial, disturbed by earlier antiquarian digging. The burial mound was identified as an Anglo-Saxon hlaew. Also within the fort enclosure are the remains of a late 18th-century telegraph station. Traces remain in the form of rectangular earthworks and stone, concrete, and brick foundations. The station was a part of the Portsmouth-London semaphore line. Cross dykes traverse the ridges to the east and west of the Beacon Hill. These are considered to be outlying defences associated with the fort. When Harting Beacon fell into disuse, it may have been replaced by the nearby Iron Age hillfort at Torberry Hill. This conjecture is supported by the known chronology of the two sites.Cunliffe 2006, p. 157. Notes References :Cunliffe, Barry (1995). Iron Age Britain. London, England: B. T.

These guns were used on all Condottieri-class light cruisers except the Duca degli Abruzzi-class. Construction The Model 1926 was designed and manufactured by Ansaldo, while the Model 1929 was manufactured by OTO Melara. Although both models of gun were similar in construction, components from each manufacturer were not fully interchangeable. The gun mounts had electrically powered training, elevation, hoists, rammers and the guns shared a common cradle. Improvements in ammunition handling meant that the rate of fire for the Model 1929 was nearly twice as fast as the Model 1926. Loading was at +20¬∞ for the Model 1926, while the model 1929 could be loaded at any angle up to 45¬∞. These guns suffered from dispersion problems so the original muzzle velocity of was reduced to with AP shells. Shell weight was also reduced from to in an attempt to resolve these problems, but were only partially successful. The main reason for the dispersion problem was because the guns were mounted too close together on a common cradle, which also complicated loading of the guns.Campbell, Naval Weapons of WWII, p.331-332. Naval Service The majority of the Condottieri- classes had two superfiring twin-mount turrets forward and aft, except for the Duca degli Abruzzi-class which had different model guns and had two twin- turrets replaced with two triple-turrets. The Giussano-class carried Model 1926 guns, while the Cadorna-class, Montecuccoli-class and Duca d'Aosta-class carried Model 1929 guns.

It features the writer's famous detective Hercule Poirot and his companion Captain Arthur Hastings. The story was first published in November 1923 in the British weekly journal, The Sketch, as part of the series, The Grey Cells of M. Poirot II. It also was featured in a collection of short stories entitled The Second Omnibus of Crime by author Dorothy L. Sayers first published in 1932. It first appeared in book form in the U.S. in 1951 as part of the collection, The Underdog and Other Stories. In the UK, the story was featured in the collection entitled Poirot's Early Cases first published in September 1974.  Plot  Poirot is not interested in investigating some of the cases which appear in the newspapers and which Hastings tries to bring to his attention. These include a bank clerk (Mr. Davis) who disappears with fifty thousand pounds of securities, a suicidal man, and a missing typist. He is put on the spot though when visited by a Mrs. Todd who is determined that he investigate her missing cook. Challenged, he decides, with some humour and to avoid an argument, to take the seemingly trivial case. Eliza Dunn, a middle-aged woman, has walked out of her job and the Todds' house in Clapham two days ago without giving her notice and has not communicated with her employer since, except for sending for her trunk that day. Interviewing the maid in the house, Poirot finds out that the trunk was already packed, meaning that Eliza had planned to leave even though her departure was swift. The other occupants of the house are Mr Todd, who works in the city, and their lodger, Mr Simpson, who works in the same bank at which Mr Davis worked. Struck by this coincidence as he is, Poirot cannot see a connection between an absconding bank clerk and a missing cook. Poirot places advertisements in the newspaper enquiring as to the whereabouts of Eliza and several days later he is successful in locating her when she visits Poirot's rooms. She tells him a story of having come into a legacy of a house in Carlisle and an income of three hundred pounds a year, dependent upon her taking up the offer and immediately leaving domestic service. This legacy was communicated to her by a man who approached her in the street as she was returning to the Todds' house one night, the man supposedly having come from there to see her. The money came from a friend of her late grandmother who had settled in Australia and married a wealthy settler. Eliza had immediately taken the train north and a couple of days later received her belongings from Clapham, although wrapped in paper parcels and not in her old trunk, which she supposes had been kept behind by Mrs Todd in a fit of pique. Poirot rushes back to Clapham with Hastings and explains matters on the way. Simpson knew what his colleague Davis was up to at the bank. He killed the man for the securities and needed an old, inconspicuous trunk in which to hide the body and that meant diverting Eliza out of the way. It was Simpson in disguise who had approached her in the street. On arriving at Clapham, Simpson has already disappeared but is traced to an ocean liner bound for the US. The trunk with Davis' body inside is located at a Glasgow railway station. Poirot views the link between a disappearing cook and a murder to be one of his most interesting cases, and he frames the cheque sent by Mr. Todd for his consulting fee as a reminder of it.  Adaptations  On 8 January 1989, \\"The Adventure of the Clapham Cook\\" premiered as the first episode of the TV series Agatha Christie‚Äôs Poirot, starring David Suchet in the title role. The story was also adapted for the Japanese anime television series Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple, as a two-part episode titled \\"The Disappearing Cook\\" in which Poirot worked with Miss Marple's great niece, Mabel West, to solve the mystery.

The three- story building had 12 classrooms, and construction ended in 1909. The playground space was donated to the city of Houston and was considered to be larger than that of most schools. In 1926 a new campus was constructed. It had a cafeteria, an auditorium, and 12 classrooms. Travis was previously reserved for white children but it desegregated by 1970. In the 1970s it received an addition, and the campus at that time had of space. Circa 1985 the school had about 300 students. Margaret Blackstone, a teacher at Travis, stated that between 1985 and 2006 the school improved due to the establishment of a magnet program and the improvement of area neighborhoods resulting from an influx of educated professionals.Cutler, Leigh (interviewer). \\"HHA# 00645 Interviewee: Blackstone, Margaret.\\" University of Houston Oral History Project.

In 2004 the school's attendance boundary, along with that of Harvard Elementary School of the Houston Heights, was modified due to a vehicular traffic increase on Studewood Street, affecting 20 children. The adjustment was done so children would not have to cross the street. The boundaries between Travis and Crockett Elementary School in the Sixth Ward were also adjusted. - Compare boundary maps: as of early 2004 and as of 2009 By 2005 Travis was scheduled to receive a renovation of the 1926 building and a replacement of the former addition, designed by Taft Architects, located north of the original building.

These include sites that are analogues of potential subsurface habitats, and deep subsurface habitats. A few places on Earth, such as the hyper-arid core of the high Atacama Desert and the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica approach the dryness of current Mars surface conditions. In some parts of Antarctica, the only water available is in films of brine on salt / ice interfaces. There is life there, but it is rare, in low numbers, and often hidden below the surface of rocks (endoliths), making the life hard to detect. Indeed, these sites are used for testing sensitivity of future life detection instruments for Mars, furthering the study of astrobiology, for instance, as a location to test microbes for their ability to survive on Mars, and as a way to study how Earth life copes in conditions that resemble conditions on Mars. Other analogues duplicate some of the conditions that may occur in particular locations on Mars. These include ice caves, the icy fumaroles of Mount Erebus, hot springs, or the sulfur rich mineral deposits of the Rio Tinto region in Spain. Other analogues include regions of deep permafrost and high alpine regions with plants and microbes adapted to aridity, cold and UV radiation with similarities to Mars conditions. Precision of analogues Mars surface conditions are not reproduced anywhere on Earth, so Earth surface analogues for Mars are necessarily partial analogues. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly. There are no full-Mars simulations published yet that include all of the biocidal factors combined. * Ionizing radiation. Curiosity rover measured levels on Mars similar to the interior of the International Space Station (ISS), which is far higher than surface Earth levels. * Atmosphere. The Mars atmosphere is a near vacuum while Earth's is not. Through desiccation resistance, some life forms can withstand the vacuum of space in dormant state.Surviving the conditions on Mars DLR, 26 April 2012Jean-Pierre de Vera Lichens as survivors in space and on Mars Fungal Ecology Volume 5, Issue 4, August 2012, Pages 472‚Äì479F.J.

UV levels on Mars are much higher than on Earth. Experiments show that a thin layer of dust is enough to protect microorganisms from UV radiation. * Oxidizing surface. Mars has a surface layer which is highly oxidizing (toxic) because it contains salts such as perchlorates, chlorates, cholorites, and sulfates pervasive in the soil and dust, and hydrogen peroxide throughout the atmosphere. Earth does have some areas that are highly oxidizing, such as the soda lakes, and though not direct analogues, they have conditions that may be duplicated in thin films of brines on Mars. * Temperature. Nowhere on Earth reproduces the extreme changes in temperature that happen within a single day on Mars. * Dry ice. The Mars surface consists of dry ice (CO2 ice) in many areas. Even in equatorial regions, dry ice mixed with water forms frosts for about 100 days of the year. On Earth, although temperatures on Earth briefly get cold enough for dry ice to form in the Antarctic interior at high altitudes, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is too low for dry ice to form because the depositional temperature for dry ice on Earth under 1 bar of pressure is and the lowest temperature recorded in Antarctica is , recorded in 2010 by satellite. These partial analogues are useful, for instance for: * Testing life detection equipment which may one day be sent to Mars * Studying conditions for preservation of past life on Mars (biosignatures) * Studying adaptations to conditions similar to those that may occur on Mars * As a source of microbes, lichens etc. that can be studied as they may exhibit resistance to some conditions present on Mars. Atacama Desert The Atacama Desert plateau lies at an altitude of 3,000 meters and lies between the Pacific and the Andes mountains. Its Mars-like features include * Hyper arid conditions * Cold compared to most arid deserts because of the altitude * High levels of UV light (because it is relatively cloudless, also the higher altitude means less air to filter the UV out, and the ozone layer is somewhat thinner above sites in the southern hemisphere than above corresponding sites in the northern hemisphere) * Salt basins, which also include perchlorates making them the closest analogues to Martian salts on Earth. =Yungay area= The Yungay area at the core of the Atacama Desert used to be considered the driest area on Earth for more than a decade, until the discovery in 2015 that Maria Elena South is drier. It can go centuries without rainfall, and parts of it have been hyper-arid for 150 million years. The older regions in this area have salts that are amongst the closest analogues of salts on Mars because these regions have nitrate deposits that contain not only the usual chlorides, but also sulfates, chlorates, chromates, iodates, and perchlorates. The infrared spectra are similar to the spectra of bright soil regions of Mars. The Yungay area has been used for testing instruments intended for future life detection missions on Mars, such as the Sample Analysis at Mars instruments for Curiosity, the Mars Organic Analyzer for ExoMars, and Solid3 for Icebreaker Life, which in 2011, in a test of its capabilities, was able to find a new \\"microbial oasis\\" for life two meters below the surface of the Atacama desert.Microbial oasis discovered beneath the Atacama Desert, PUBLIC RELEASE: 16 FEB 2012, FECYT - SPANISH FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY It is the current testing site for the Atacama Rover Astrobiology Drilling Studies (ARADS) project to improve technology and strategies for life detection on Mars. Experiments conducted on Mars have also been successfully repeated in this region. In 2003, a group led by Chris McKay repeated the Viking Lander experiments in this region and got the same results as those of the Viking landers on Mars: decomposition of the organics by non biological processes. The samples had trace elements of organics, no DNA was recovered, and extremely low levels of culturable bacteria. This led to increased interest in the site as a Mars analogue. Although hardly any life, including plant or animal life, exists in this area, the Yungay area does have some microbial life, including cyanobacteria, both in salt pillars, as a green layer below the surface of rocks, and beneath translucent rocks such as quartz. The cyanobacteria in the salt pillars have the ability to take advantage of the moisture in the air at low relative humidities. They begin to photosynthesize when the relative humidity rises above the deliquescence relative humidity of salt, at 75%, presumably making use of deliquescence of the salts.Osano, A., and A. F. Davila. \\"Analysis of Photosynthetic Activity of Cyanobacteria Inhabiting Halite Evaporites of Atacama Desert, Chile.\\" Lunar and Planetary Institute Science Conference Abstracts. Vol. 45. 2014. Researchers have also found that cyanobacteria in these salt pillars can photosynthesize when the external relative humidity is well below this level, taking advantage of micropores in the salt pillars which raise the internal relative humidity above the external levels. The Ice Towers of Mt. Erebus as analogues of biological refuges on Mars, N. Hoffman and P. R. Kyle, Sixth International Conference on Mars (2003) =Maria Elena South= This site is even drier than the Yungay area. It was found through a systematic search for drier regions than Yungay in the Atacama Desert, using relative humidity data loggers set up from 2008 to 2012, with the results published in 2015. The relative humidity is the same as the lowest relative humidity measured by Curiosity rover. A 2015 paper reported an average atmospheric relative humidity 17.3%, and soils relative humidity a constant 14% at depth of 1 meter, which corresponds to the lowest humidity measured by Curiosity rover on Mars. This region's maximum atmospheric relative humidity is 54.7% compared with 86.8% for the Yungay region. The following living organisms were also found in this region: * Actinobacteria: Actinobacterium, Aciditerrmonas, and Geodermatophilus * Proteobacteria: Caulobacter and Sphyingomonas * Firmicutes: Firmicutes and Clostridiales * Acidobacteria: Acidobacterium * 16 new species of Streptomyces, 5 of Bacillus and 1 of Geodermatophilus. There was no decrease in the numbers of species as the soil depth increased down to a depth of one meter, although different microbes inhabited different soil depths. There was no colonization of gypsum, showing the extreme dryness of the site. No archaea was detected in this region using the same methods that detected archaea in other regions of the Atacama Desert. The researchers said that if this is confirmed in studies of similarly dry sites, it could mean that \\"there may be a dry limit for this domain of life on Earth.\\"  McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica  Researchers scout out field sites in Antarctica's Beacon Valley, one of McMurdo Dry Valleys, is one of the most Mars-like places on Earth in terms of cold and dryness. These valleys lie on the edge of the Antarctic plateau. They are kept clear of ice and snow by fast katabatic winds that blow from the plateau down through the valleys. As a result, they are amongst the coldest and driest areas in the world. The central region of Beacon Valley is considered to be one of the best terrestrial analogues for the current conditions on Mars. There is snowdrift and limited melting around the edges and occasionally in the central region, but for the most part, moisture is only found as thin films of brine around permafrost structures. It has slightly alkaline salt rich soil. Katabatic winds =Don Juan Pond= Don Juan Pond is a small pond in Antarctica, 100 meters by 300 meters, and 10 cm deep, that is of great interest for studying the limits of habitability in general. Research using a time-lapse camera shows that it is partly fed by deliquescing salts. The salts absorb water by deliquescence only, at times of high humidity, then flows down the slope as salty brines. These then mix with snow melt, which feeds the lake. The first part of this process may be related to the processes that form the Recurring Slope Lineae (RSLs) on Mars. This valley has an exceptionally low water activity (aw) of 0.3 to 0.6. Though microbes have been retrieved from it, they have not been shown to be able to reproduce in the salty conditions present in the lake, and it is possible that they only got there through being washed in by the rare occasions of snow melt feeding the lake. =Blood Falls= A schematic cross-section of Blood Falls showing how subglacial microbial communities have survived in cold, darkness, and absence of oxygen for a million years in brine water below Taylor Glacier. This unusual flow of melt water from below the glacier gives scientists access to an environment they could otherwise only explore by drilling (which would also risk contaminating it). The melt water source is a subglacial pool of unknown size which sometimes overflows. Biogeochemical analysis shows that the water is marine in source originally. One hypothesis is that the source may be the remains of an ancient fjord that occupied the Taylor valley in the tertiary period. The ferrous iron dissolved in the water oxidizes as the water reaches the surface, turning the water red. Its autotrophic bacteria metabolize sulfate and ferric ions. According to geomicrobiologist Jill Mikucki at the University of Tennessee, water samples from Blood Falls contained at least 17 different types of microbes and almost no oxygen. An explanation may be that the microbes use sulfate as a catalyst to respire with ferric ions and metabolize the trace levels of organic matter trapped with them. Such a metabolic process had never before been observed in nature. This process is of astrobiological importance as an analogue for environments below the Glaciers on Mars, if there is any liquid water there, for instance through hydrothermal melting (though none such has been discovered yet). This process is also an analogue for cryovolcanism in icy moons such as Enceladus. Subglacial environments in Antarctica need similar protection protocols to interplanetary missions. Blood Falls was used as the target for testing IceMole in November 2014. This is being developed in connection with the Enceladus Explorer (EnEx) project by a team from the FH Aachen in Germany. The test returned a clean subglacial sample from the outflow channel from Blood Falls. Ice Mole navigates through the ice by melting it, also using a driving ice screw, and using differential melting to navigate and for hazard avoidance. It is designed for autonomous navigation to avoid obstacles such as cavities and embedded meteorites, so that it can be deployed remotely on Encladus. It uses no drilling fluids, and can be sterilized to suit the planetary protection requirements as well as the requirements for subglacial exploration. The probe was sterilized to these protocols using hydrogen peroxide and UV sterilization. Also, only the tip of the probe samples the liquid water directly. Qaidam Basin David Rubin of the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center at Qaidam Basin At , Qaidam Basin is the plateau with highest average elevation on the Earth. The atmospheric pressure is 50% - 60% of sea level pressures, and as a result of the thin atmosphere it has high levels of UV radiation, and large temperature swings from day to night. Also, the Himalayas to the South block humid air from India, making it hyper arid. In the most ancient playas (Da Langtang) at the north west of the plateau, the evaporated salts are magnesium sulfates (sulfates are common on Mars). This, combined with the cold and dryness conditions make it an interesting analogue of the Martian salts and salty regolith. An expedition found eight strains of Haloarchaea inhabiting the salts, similar to some species of Virgibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Halobacillus, and Ter- ribacillus.Wang, A., et al. \\"Saline Playas on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as Mars Analog for the Formation-Preservation of Hydrous Salts and Biosignatures.\\" AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts.

Axel Heiberg Island (Canada) Two sites of special interest: Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill, two sets of cold saline springs on Axel Heiberg Island that flow with almost constant temperature and flow rate throughout the year. The air temperatures are comparable to the McMurdo Dry Valleys, range -15 ¬∞C to -20 ¬∞C (for the McMurdo Dry Valleys -15 ¬∞C to -40 ¬∞C). The island is an area of thick permafrost with low precipitation, leading to desert conditions. The water from the springs has a temperature of between -4 ¬∞C and 7 ¬∞C. A variety of minerals precipitate out of the springs including gypsum, and at Colour Peak crystals of the metastable mineral ikaite (¬∑6) which decomposes rapidly when removed from freezing water.Impey, Chris, Jonathan Lunine, and Jos√© Funes, eds. Frontiers of astrobiology (page 161). Cambridge University Press, 2012. Some of the extremophiles from these two sites have been cultured in simulated Martian environment, and it is thought that they may be able to survive in a Martian cold saline spring, if such exist. =Colour Lake Fen= This is another Mars analogue habitat in Axel Heiberg Island close to Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill. The frozen soil and permafrost hosts many microbial communities that are tolerant of anoxic, acid, saline and cold conditions. Most are in survival rather than colony forming mode. Colour Lake Fen is a good terrestrial analogue of the saline acidic brines that once existed in the Meridani Planum region of Mars and may possibly still exist on the martian surface. Some of the microbes found there are able to survive in Mars-like conditions. Rio Tinto, Spain Rio Tinto is the largest known sulfide deposit in the world, and it is located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. (IPB). Riotintoagua Many of the extremophiles that live in these deposits are thought to survive independently of the Sun. This area is rich in iron and sulfur minerals such as * hematite () which is common in the Meridiani Planum area of Mars explored by Opportunity rover and though to be signs of ancient hot springs on Mars. Jarosite, on quartz * jarosite (), discovered on Mars by Opportunity and on Earth forms either in acid mine drainage, during oxidation of sulphide minerals, and during alteration of volcanic rocks by acidic, sulphur-rich fluids near volcanic vents.  Permafrost soils  Much of the water on Mars is permanently frozen, mixed with the rocks. So terrestrial permafrosts are a good analogue. And some of the Carnobacterium species isolated from permafrosts have the ability to survive under the conditions of the low atmospheric pressures, low temperatures and dominated anoxic atmosphere of Mars.Nicholson, Wayne, et al. \\"Isolation of bacteria from Siberian permafrost capable of growing under simulated Mars atmospheric pressure and composition.\\" 40th COSPAR Scientific Assembly. Held 2‚Äì10 August 2014, in Moscow, Russia, Abstract F3. 3-10-14.. Vol. 40. 2014.  Ice caves  Ice caves, or ice preserved under the surface in cave systems protected from the surface conditions, may exist on Mars. The ice caves near the summit of Mount Erebus in Antarctica, are associated with fumaroles in a polar alpine environments starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock.  Cave systems  Mines on Earth give access to deep subsurface environments which turn out to be inhabited, and deep caves may possibly exist on Mars, although without the benefits of an atmosphere. =Basaltic lava tubes= The only caves found so far on Mars are lava tubes. These are insulated to some extent from surface conditions and may retain ice also when there is none left on the surface, and may have access to chemicals such as hydrogen from serpentization to fuel chemosynthetic life. Lava tubes on Earth have microbial mats, and mineral deposits inhabited by microbes. These are being studied to help with identification of life on Mars if any of the lava tubes there are inhabited.Northup, Diana E., et al. \\"Life In Earth‚Äôs lava caves: Implications for life detection on other planets.\\" Life on Earth and other Planetary Bodies. Springer Netherlands, 2012. 459-484. =Lechuguilla Cave= First of the terrestrial sulfur caves to be investigated as a Mars analogue for sulfur based ecosystems that could possibly exist underground also on Mars.Nadis, Steve. \\"Looking inside earth for life on Mars.\\" Technology Review 100.8 (1997): 14‚Äì16. On Earth, these form when hydrogen sulfide from below the cave meets the surface oxygenated zone. As it does so, sulfuric acid forms, and microbes accelerate the process. The high abundance of sulfur on Mars combined with presence of ice, and trace detection of methane suggest the possibility of sulfur caves below the surface of Mars like this. = Cueva de Villa Luz = The Snottites in the toxic sulfur cave Cueva de Villa Luz flourish on Hydrogen Sulfide gas and though some are aerobes (though only needing low levels of oxygen), some of these species (e.g. Acidianus), like those that live around hydrothermal vents, are able to survive independent of a source of oxygen. So the caves may give insight into subsurface thermal systems on Mars, where caves similar to the Cueva de Villa Luz could occur. =Movile Cave= * Movile Caveis thought to have been isolated from the atmosphere and sunlight for 5.5 million years. * Atmosphere rich in and with 1% - 2% (methane) * It does have some oxygen, 7-10% in the cave atmosphere, compared to 21% in the air * Microbes rely mainly on sulfide and methane oxidation. * Has 33 vertebrates and a wide range of indigenous microbes. Magnesium sulfate lakes Crystals of Meridianiite, formula Magnesium sulfate 11 hydrate ¬∑11. Evidence from orbital measurements show that this is the phase of Magnesium sulfate which would be in equilibrium with the ice in the Martian polar and sub polar regions It also occurs on the Earth, for instance in Basque Lake 2 in Western Columbia, which may give an analogue for Mars habitats Vugs on Mars which may be voids left by Meridianiite when it dissolved or dehydrated Opportunity found evidence for magnesium sulfates on Mars (one form of it is epsomite, or \\"Epsom salts\\"), in 2004. Curiosity rover has detected calcium sulfates on Mars. Orbital maps also suggest that hydrated sulfates may be common on Mars. The orbital observations are consistent with iron sulfate or a mixture of calcium and magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a likely component of cold brines on Mars, especially with the limited availability of subsurface ice. Terrestrial magnesium sulfate lakes have similar chemical and physical properties. They also have a wide range of halophilic organisms, in all the three Kingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota), in the surface and near subsurface. With the abundance of algae and bacteria, in alkaline hypersaline conditions, they are of astrobiological interest for both past and present life on Mars. These lakes are most common in western Canada, and the northern part of Washington state, USA. One of the examples, is Basque Lake 2 in Western Canada, which is highly concentrated in magnesium sulfate. In summer it deposits epsomite (\\"Epsom salts\\"). In winter, it deposits meridianiite. This is named after Meridiani Planum where Opportunity rover found crystal molds in sulfate deposits (Vugs) which are thought to be remains of this mineral which have since been dissolved or dehydrated. It is preferentially formed at subzero temperatures, and is only stable below 2 ¬∞C, while Epsomite (¬∑7) is favored at higher temperatures. Another example is Spotted Lake, which shows a wide variety of minerals, most of them sulfates, with sodium, magnesium and calcium as cations. Spotted Lake in British Columbia, Canada. Its sulfate concentrations are amongst the highest in the world. Every summer the water evaporated to form this pattern of interconnected brine pools separated by salt crusts Some of the microbes isolated have been able to survive the high concentrations of magnesium sulfates found in Martian soils, also at low temperatures that may be found on Mars. Sulfates (for instance of sodium, magnesium and calcium) are also common in other continental evaporates (such as the salars of the Atacama Desert), as distinct from salt beds associated with marine deposits which tend to consist mainly of halites (chlorides).  Subglacial lakes  Lake Vostok drill 2011 Subglacial lakes such as Lake Vostok may give analogues of Mars habitats beneath ice sheets. Sub glacial lakes are kept liquid partly by the pressure of the depth of ice, but that contributes only a few degrees of temperature rise. The main effect that keeps them liquid is the insulation of the ice blocking escape of heat from the interior of the Earth, similarly to the insulating effect of deep layers of rock. As for deep rock layers, they don't require extra geothermal heating below a certain depth. In the case of Mars, the depth needed for geothermal melting of the basal area of a sheet of ice is 4-6 kilometers. The ice layers are probably only 3.4 to 4.2 km in thickness for the north polar cap. However, it was shown that the situation is different when considering a lake that is already melted. When they applied their model to Mars, they showed that a liquid layer, once melted (initially open to the surface of the ice), could remain stable at any depth over 600 meters even in absence of extra geothermal heating. According to their model, if the polar regions had a subsurface lake perhaps formed originally through friction as a subglacial lake at times of favourable axial tilt, then supplied by accumulating layers of snow on top as the ice sheets thickened, they suggest that it could still be there. If so, it could be occupied by similar life forms to those that could survive in Lake Vostok. Ground penetrating radar could detect these lakes because of the high radar contrast between water and ice or rock. MARSIS, the ground penetrating radar on ESA's Mars Express detected a subglacial lake in Mars near the south pole.  Subsurface life kilometers below the surface  Investigations of life in deep mines, and drilling beneath the ocean depths may give an insight into possibilities for life in the Mars hydrosphere and other deep subsurface habitats, if they exist. =Mponeng gold mine in South Africa= * bacteria obtain their energy from hydrogen oxidation linked to sulfate reduction, living independent of the surface * nematodes feeding on those bacteria, again living independent of the surface. * 3 to 4 km depth =Boulby Mine on the edge of the Yorkshire moors= * 250 million year halite (chloride) and sulfate salts * High salinity and low water activity * 1.1. km depth * Anaerobic microbes that could survive cut off from the atmosphere  Alpine and permafrost lichens  In high alpine and polar regions, lichens have to cope with conditions of high UV fluxes low temperatures and arid environments. This is especially so when the two factors, polar regions and high altitudes are combined. These conditions occur in the high mountains of Antarctica, where lichens grow at altitudes up to 2,000 meters with no liquid water, just snow and ice. Researchers described this as the most Mars-like environment on the Earth.

History The region around Cagliatscha was originally granted to the Bishop of Chur, who later gave it to the Freiherr von Vaz as a fief. The Vaz family built a number of small castles throughout their lands, including Cagliatscha. It was probably finished around 1266 as several of the wooden beams have been dated to that year. There are no surviving records of the castle and even its original name is unknown. In the 16th century the chronicler Campbell called the ruins Castellatsch which is Romansh for bad castle, which evolved into Cagliatscha. It was probably the home of the ministeriales Panigad or Stainbrugg family and their coat of arms is carved into the wall. It may have been built to protect the trade road that ran through the valley. After the extinction of the Vaz line in 1338, their lands and castles were inherited by the Counts of Werdenberg-Sargans. In 1424 the inhabitants of the valley joined the Grey League. In 1451 the Count led an army into the valley in an attempt to force them to leave the League and come back under his authority. The Count was unsuccessful in his attempt to bring the Hinterrhein valley back under his control and had to sell the land to the Bishop of Chur. By 1458 the valley bought their freedom from the Bishop. During his campaign in the area, a number of castles were destroyed. It is likely that Cagliatscha was one of these. A fire weakened the foundations of much of the castle leading to the collapse of three out of four walls. The castle was never rebuilt. In 1984/85 it was cataloged and renovated by volunteers from the Burgenvereins Graub√ºnden.

The walls were thick on the entrance side and thick on the other three sides. Today only the southern wall remains. It is about and five stories high. The walls are made of large, uneven stones with square corner stones. The original entrance was located on the south side on the second story. Later, a third story was added with a new entrance on the third story of the west wall. The third story was built with larger, more square stones. The largest of which was over . The fourth and fifth stories had wooden hoardings added around the tower. The pyramidal roof was covered with slate.

Some of the more well known theories for these burials are that the dogs were healers or had healing properties, the dogs were possible substitutes for humans, some even go to say that these dogs could have been adopted humans, work animals such as pack dogs or that these dogs served as a guide and judge to the deceased they were buried with.. One trend that was seen during the Middle archaic mainly was that an individual or individuals that were buried with dogs suffered violent deaths either in war or as punishment for crimes. Another trend that was present during the Archaic, was that these dogs were not used for a food source unless in drastic times.

It is used commonly in commercial farms for chickens, ducks, and other birds, and the opposite, light deprivation, is used in most breeds geese who have opposite laying seasons.  History  The first recorded successful use of artificial lighting to increase egg production was in 1895, by Dr. E. C. Waldorf. It started to be used commercially in 1920. It was commonly believed that the increase in daylight caused an increase in egg production because it allowed for more feeding time of the laying hens, although in 1939, it was discovered by two scientists, Burmester and Card, that as little as 6 hours of daylight was enough time to allow the poultry to feed.  Use  Artificial light supplementation is used commonly in large commercial farms, to extend the laying season of the poultry. It is used commonly for chickens, ducks, geese, and other birds. It is meant to supplement the natural sunlight received by the birds that stimulates their egg production, during the shorter days of the year.  Effects  Artificial light supplementation increases the egg production and extends the laying of some birds (such as chickens and ducks) because they rely on the changes in daylight hours - associated with season changes - to know when it is the proper time to lay their eggs. It is supplied to birds by shining a light - usually from a high pressure sodium, tungsten (incandescent), or fluorescent light bulb - into the living areas of the poultry, during some of the dark hours of the day. The orange and red lights (of approximately 590 - 750nm wavelengths) that are similar to those produced by the sun make the birds sexually active during the winter by stimulating their anterior lobe, located in the pituitary gland of the brain, causing the bird to produce a hormone that increases the activity of the bird's sex glands, increasing egg production. Farms will usually try to match the amount of sunlight and artificial light that the birds get with the amount received from the sun on the longest day of the year Some birds that only lay during the shorter days of the year require increased darkness during the summer months to maximize egg production, rather than increased lighting during the winter. = Effects on Egg Hatchability = It is possible that the hatchability of eggs laid during the use of artificial lighting is decreased, although consensus has not been reached on this issue.

The song was first released by The Byrds on their 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Lyrics and music \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" has country music elements, as do other Basement Tapes songs. Several authors, including Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus, have suggested that the song is based on Fats Domino's 1940 standard \\"Blueberry Hill.\\" But critic Clinton Heylin has suggested that the melody may have been conceived spontaneously by Dylan or else based on a country music riff he may have heard sometime earlier. A straightforward interpretation suggests that the lyrics describe a failed deal, possibly a drug deal, in which the promised goods were not delivered. An alternative interpretation is that the song is addressing politicians, or society's elites in general, who lie and don't deliver what they promise and are thus asked in the song to return what they have taken and explain their actions. Oliver Trager suggests a possible religious interpretation; that the singer is a preacher asking a church congregation to forgive an unspecified betrayal, perhaps even that of Judas Iscariot. Music critic Robert Shelton considered the song as one of several of Dylan's songs from this period whose theme is the search for salvation. He also noted that it is one of several songs from the period that makes prominent use of the word \\"nothing\\" or \\"nowhere\\". He suggests a possible influence from King Lear, where these words also are used to great effect. Shelton also points out that the word \\"nothing\\" \\"echoes the artists dilemma: death versus life, vacuum versus harvest, isolation versus people, silence versus sound, the void versus life-impulse\\". Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon describe the lyrics as dark and threatening. But Andy Gill describes the lyrics as \\"more sad than angry\\" about the betrayal, particularly the last line of the refrain, \\"Take care of yourself and get plenty of rest,\\" which he describes as being an ambivalent expression suggesting both a threat and a caring farewell. Dylan and the Band version Dylan and the Band recorded multiple versions of \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" between September and October 1967 at the \\"Big Pink\\" house they were using in West Saugerties, New York. Two complete versions are known to exist as well as one fragment. The first version, which Heylin regards as more successful, was used for The Basement Tapes. This version begins with Richard Manuel playing on the piano. Dylan plays a 12-string guitar on this version. The other musicians are Robbie Robertson on guitar, Garth Hudson on organ, and Rick Danko on bass guitar, and Manuel and Danko provide backup vocals. Margotin and Guesdon note that the contrast between the heavy, threatening lyrics and light music is a key element of the song, and point out that Dylan has used a similar contrast in other songs on The Basement Tapes, such as \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere.\\" Gill describes Dylan's vocal and Robertson's guitar being \\"of a piece, dramatic and intimate as if sharing confidences\\" about the incident described in the lyrics. The two complete versions do not include drums. Levon Helm, the Band drummer who temporarily left the group earlier, stated in his autobiography that he played the drums for a recording of this song. The fragmentary version does include drums, but Heylin has suggested that this sounds more like Manuel's drumming style. He has suggested that this may mean that the Band may have recorded another version for possible inclusion on their own album. The Byrds version Dylan had intended to donate \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" to other singers rather than release it himself. It was one of fourteen songs from the Basement Tapes sessions that were circulated by Dylan's publishers in an effort to get other artists to record them. Byrds bassist Chris Hillman has stated that he personally received tapes in late 1967 or early 1968 that contained, among others, \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" and \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere.\\" Hillman stated that he received the tapes through Columbia Records, which was both the Byrds' and Dylan's record label. Byrds guitarist Roger McGuinn suggested that their producer Gary Usher may have been their source for the tapes stating that \\"We always had a good relationship with Dylan's publishers...we heard the songs, and we were as thrilled as you might have expected us to have been with this material. The Byrds recorded \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" in Nashville on March 15, 1968, for Sweetheart of the Rodeo, six days after having recorded \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\" there. McGuinn sang the lead vocal in what music critic Johnny Rogan described as McGuinn's \\"best Dylan imitation voice.\\" Lloyd Green played pedal steel guitar and Byrds biographer Christopher Hjort assumes that Gram Parsons played the \\"unobtrusive\\" piano part. Drummer Kevin Kelley played in a rock style rather than a country style for the only time on the album, with Rogan noting that the contrast between the rock style drumming and the pedal steel guitar produced a \\"startling crescendo.\\" Hjort particularly praises McGuinn's arrangement, taking the song \\"from Dylan's triplet feel to a country shuffle.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan described the song as a \\"surprise highlight\\" of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, particularly praising McGuinn's vocal. Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield calls the Byrds' version \\"great\\" and \\"scary\\" and a \\"peak\\" of the Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. Reviewing Sweetheart of the Rodeo, New York Times critic William Kloman stated that the two songs written by Dylan were \\"treated with characteristic and confident tastefulness.\\" Allmusic critic Rick Clark described them as \\"pure magic.\\" On the other hand, music writer Sean Egan panned the song as being \\"overly mordant\\" and stated that the only notable aspect of the recording was that its bass line presented one of the few rock sounds on the album. Other versions Buddy Emmons covered \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" on his 1975 album Steel Guitar. Allmusic critic Eugene Chadbourne disliked the recording, stating that it sounded like it was being played by a wedding band. The Original Marauders covered the song on their 1977 album Now Your Mouth Cries Wolf.

As a continuous process, assessment establishes measurable and clear student learning outcomes for learning, provisioning a sufficient amount of learning opportunities to achieve these outcomes, implementing a systematic way of gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well student learning matches expectations, and using the collected information to inform improvement in student learning. Assessment functions as part of a continuous process whereby the parts of the cycle are revised and monitored. The term ‚Äúassessment‚Äù is defined broadly in that any outcome or goal in any activity or discipline can be a part of this process. Types Assessment in higher education can focus on the individual learner, a course, an academic program, or the institution. =Course-level assessment= Assessment embedded at the course level (sometimes referred to as embedded assessment orAuthentic_assessment) typically involves the use of assignments. Students receive feedback on their performance on assignments and faculty gain knowledge of student learning to use for grading. The work assessed within courses best relates to specific program-level student learning outcomes. Angelo and Cross believe assessment in the classroom is an important part of the faculty feedback loop which can provide meaningful information about their effectiveness as teachers while also giving students a measure of their progress as learners.  Student perception of feedback  Studies show feedback is valued by students. Feedback that is timely, specific and delivered individually helps to reinforces this perception. This type of feedback, usually referred to as Just In Time, helps to create a feedback loop between student and teacher. Students generally find more utility from formative feedback when they are also presented with strategies of how to use the feedback. These strategies help with perception because they tackle lack of understanding of academic discourse which hinders students' ability to use the feedback effectively.  Quality of feedback Timing is crucial in the delivery of feedback to students. Kift and Moody claim that the complexity of the assignment should dictate how soon feedback should provided. For simpler tasks, feedback should be provided within 24 hours. However, if the task is more complicated, giving students time for reflection before providing feedback is more beneficial. \\"Effective feedback should be task related and focus on student performance rather than personal attributes of the student.\\" Studies have shown that the way feedback is delivered can have either positive or negative effects on the student. Corrective feedback helps to move student learning forward and improves future assessments.  Principles of good feedback  # Facilitates the development of self-assessment (reflection) in learning. ##Students might request the kinds of feedback they want. ##Students can identify the strengths and weaknesses in their own work, based on a rubric, before giving it to the teacher for feedback. ##Students reflect on their achievements. ##Teacher and student set milestones So they can reflect back and on progress, and forward on what to do next ##Students give peer feedback to one another. # Encourages teacher and peer dialogue around learning. ##The use of one-minute-papers ##Read feedback given by teacher, and discuss with other students. ##Discussing feedback that students found useful and why. ##Group projects. # Helps clarify what good performance is (goals, criteria, standards expected). ##Provide students with good examples along with feedback. ##Discussion about criteria in the classroom. ##Include student participation during feedback process. ##Collaborate with students on creating grading/feedback rubric. # Provides opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance. ##Increase the number of opportunities for resubmitting assignemnents. ##Teacher models how to close the learning gap. ##Include ‚ÄúAction Points‚Äù for students along with feedback. ###Alternatively, have the students figure out their own action points. # Delivers high quality information to students about their learning. ##Being cognizant of the number of criteria used in feedback to ensure it remains effective, by limiting the amount of feedback. ##Providing feedback soon after the activity.Just-in-time teaching - Wikipedia ##Provide corrective advice. ##Prioritizing areas of improvement. # Encourages positive motivational beliefs and advocates for self-efficacy. ##Giving students a grade only after they've responded to feedback. ##Allowing students time to rewrite certain parts of their work based on feedback. ##Automated testing. # Provides information to teachers that can be used to help shape the teaching. ##Exit- ticket/One-minute papers. ##Students request feedback they want. ##Having students identify where they are having trouble. ##Students work in groups to choose one idea they are unclear about and share that idea. =Program-level assessment= Program assessment is a best practice in higher education. The process involves a framework for placing priority and attention on the process of student learning and most specifically, the program objectives, organization of curriculum, pedagogy and student development. Like course assessment, program assessment requires defining a statement of mission/goals, establishment of program-specific student learning outcomes and the identification of where learning takes place or ‚Äúlearning opportunities‚Äù. The next part in program assessment involves the development of a research question or intended goal for assessment. What questions does the program seek to answer? And what direct or indirect evidence needs to be collected to identify answers? The collected data is evaluated, analyzed and interpreted resulting in the implementation of an action plan resulting in improvement in the program and student learning.  Mission alignment  Each course a student takes occurs within the context of a program, which occurs within the context of overarching university outcomes. With the assumption that coursework should support the program and programs should support the overall mission of the university, alignment of mission (and learning outcomes) should occur. Assessment at the course level typically takes the form of tests, quizzes, and assignments. When courses are mapped to program outcomes, this permits the aggregation of data from several courses covering the same outcome which can be used for program assessment. Additional program assessment can take the form of embedded assignments, field experiences, capstone experiences, portfolios, or tests of majors.  Scoring guides Rubrics are often used to assess student work. Essentially, a rubric is a scoring guide grid consisting of a scale of some sort (i.e., levels of performance), the dimensions or important components of an assignment, and descriptions of what constitutes each level of performance for each assignment dimension. Rubrics can be particularly effective for assessment due to how closely they are tied with the teaching and learning process - they can be used for grading, as well as giving students feedback on their performance.  Assessment points  Assessment is most effective when it occurs at multiple points in time along the student's path. Multiple measures over time provide a way to triangulate data and increase confidence in the results.  Effective assignments  In order to assess student learning, students must given assignment where they can demonstrate what they know and can do.  Indirect and direct measures  A distinction is made between direct and indirect measures of learning. Direct measures, as their name implies, involve directly examining student work products to assess the achievement of learning outcomes. These work products occur in a variety of formats including objective tests, and rubric-scored projects, performances, and written work. A recent survey of provosts indicates that classroom based assessment and rubrics are most frequently used. Large scale commercial tests such as the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) are used by fewer than 50% use standardized tests according to the survey. Indirect measures focus on data from which one can make inferences about learning. Indirect measures can include surveys on student and faculty perceptions about learning, focus groups, and exit interviews. National surveys such as the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) have become increasing popular indirect measures, with roughly 85% of institutions using these measures according to a recent survey. Sampling In a classroom setting or in a program level assessment, it is often possible to assess the entire population of interest, referred to as a census. However, it is sometimes impractical or ineffective to assess an entire population, due to the time and effort involved as well as survey fatigue if the same group of students are being asked to take multiple surveys. Therefore, sampling strategies can be used to pick a subset of the population of interest. The goal of sampling is to select a smaller group that represents the population on key characteristics. Multiple sampling approaches are commonly used in higher education assessment, including random and stratified sampling. In a random sample, each individual is equally likely to be selected. In a stratified sample, individuals are grouped based on specific characteristics of interest and then randomly selected from each group to ensure adequate numbers of each group.  Use of findings  Assessment data are only effective in \\"closing the loop\\" and improving programs if they are shared and communicated widely.  Benchmarking  Benchmarking is a way for an institution or program to determine how a sample measures up to others or to themselves at an earlier time. = Professional organizations = There are numerous regional organizations dedicated to discussing issues and policies related to assessment in higher education. The Association for the Assessment of Learning in Higher Education (AALHE) is one international organization. Seven other regional assessment organizations exist in the United States. In an interview with the Chronicle for Higher Education, Marsha Watson, former director of the AALHE, stated that the ‚Äúrising demands for accountability mean that assessment must evolve into its own discipline.\\" The National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment is another organization dedicated to helping institutions use assessment data to improve academic quality. They have delivered a number of research papers on assessment practices. =Benefits= There is heightened political and public pressure on higher education institutions to explain what they are trying to do and provide evidence they are actually doing it. Faculty want students to learn. In addition, faculty love their disciplines and want to share their knowledge and enthusiasm with students. Placing emphasis on what students learn and what students do helps to effectively drive improvement in the learning process, program planning and overall institutional improvement. Assessment adds transparency to the teaching and learning process, helps to provide some evidence to the effectiveness of student learning and promotes an environment where continuous improvement is well understood and ingrained in the institutional culture. Linda Suskie, a higher education consultant, says that \\"Good assessments are not once-and-done affairs. They are part of an ongoing, organized, and systematized effort to understand and improve teaching and learning.‚Äù =Criticism= Some university faculty and researchers have criticized student learning outcomes assessment in higher education. Robert Shireman, a senior fellow for the Century Foundation, argued that accrediting agencies often require institutions to reduce learning to meaningless blurbs, or student learning outcomes, which ‚Äúprevents rather than leads to the type of quality assurance that has student work at the center.‚Äù Erik Gilbert, a professor of History, wrote another notable essay criticizing assessment in higher education arguing that it has little effect on educational quality and that accrediting agencies require institutions to invest time and resources in collecting evidence on student learning even though, he believes, that it does not improve academic quality. Molly Worthen also criticized assessment for its seeming lack of empirical evidence indicating it improves student learning. However, Matthew Fuller and others have developed the Surveys of Assessment Culture, aimed at examining the foundations of institutional cultures of assessment through empirical studies.

Biography  In 1815, at the age of twelve, he left his native village with his uncle, who was the Chaplain of the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Valdejimena in Horcajo Medianero. Three years later, he was enrolled at the seminary in Salamanca, where he studied Philosophy and Theology and became a Substitute Professor of Mathematics. He took his bachelor's degree from the University of Salamanca. In 1825, he received the four minor orders and a Subdeaconate. The following year, he was ordained a Deacon and was named a Professor of Philosophy at the University. In 1828, he became a Presbyter and obtained his Doctorate in Holy Scripture. He was also a Professor at the seminary and later became its Rector. In 1848, he was named Bishop of Jaca and, in 1851, was promoted to Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela. Queen Isabella II made him a Senator for Life and awarded him the Order of Charles III. At the request of Pope Pius IX, he participated in the preparatory acts and the declaration of the dogmatic definition for the Immaculate Conception, after which the Pope created him a Cardinal with the titular church of Santa Prisca. He was chosen as a Deputy to the Cortes Constituyentes de 1869, where he defended the established Catholic Confessionalism of the Kingdom of Spain. This led to a dispute with the Provisional Government that prevented him from attending the First Vatican Council. Later, he was elected a Senator from the Province of Vizcaya. A year before his death, he presided over the consecration of the central cupolas at the Bas√≠lica del Pilar. He died at the Archbishop's Palace in Santiago de Compostela, and is interred in the Pantheon of Archbishops at the Metropolitan Cathedral.

Later, the Tiger II was upgraded with a better turret that had thicker armor and eliminated the shot trap. It was also more angular and therefore easier to produce.

He served three Prussian kings, including Frederick, Frederick William I, and Frederick I, and fought in the major Prussian wars of the first half of the eighteenth century. During 1730-1731, he was quartermaster of the Prussian field armies. From 1741-1755, he was proprietor of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 37. Military career Peter Ludwig du Moulin was the son of the Huguenot Theophil du Moulin, who, since 1681, had served in Brandenburg military. When he was 14 years old, Peter Ludwig entered as Fahnenjunker in the Infantry Regiment Prince Leopold von Anhalt-Dessau (Nr. 3). In 1703, he was promoted to F√§hnrich (cadet). During the War of Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714), he participated in the First Battle of H√∂chst√§dt in 1703, and, subsequently, the Battle of Blenheim a year later. Kriegsgeschichtliche einzelschriften, Mittler und Sohn, 1885, p. 84. He was present at the battles of Cassano in 1705 and Turin in 1706. After 6 December 1707, he was promoted to staff captain, and assigned to the Prussian Crown Prince, Frederick William at the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709. Afterward, he participated in campaigns in the Great Northern War. In summer 1712 he was promoted to captain of his own company, and in December 1715, he was promoted to major of the newly-established Infantry Regiment Prince Leopold von Anhalt- Dessau (Nr. 27), in Stendal.Ernst Graf zur Lippe-Wei√üenfeld, Du Moulin, Peter Ludw. Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 5 (1877), S. 466, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, (Version vom 1. M√§rz 2017, 22:30 Uhr UTC) On 16 March 1722, Moulin was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently, on 26 October 1728, to colonel. When the Prussian troops were mobilized in 1729 for an imminent war over Polish succession, Frederick William, now king, appointed Moulin as quartermaster of the field armies. He was also sent to The Hague as a special envoy in 1732, and on 21 July 1735, he was given command of his own regiment. Shortly before the beginning of the War of Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), the new king, Frederick, sent Moulin to Vienna explore the situation with Austria. Consequently, he was not with the troops at the outbreak of war, but returned to the Prussian army to take part in the Battle of Mollwitz on 10 April 1741. He was promoted to major general on 5 June, and on 25 June he became the proprietor of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 37, garrisoned in Breslau. The previous proprietor was Paul Heinrich Tilio de Camas. In 1742, Moulin covered the rear of the army during the Battle of Chotusitz and then became commander-in-chief of the fortress at Glogau. In gratitude for his services, he received the municipal office of Raden at Rinteln, in addition to that of Kolbatz, which he had held since 1731. On the second invasion of Bohemia, Moulin's regiment was part of the first corps, which, during the summer of 1744, laid a successful siege to Prague. On 14 November 1744, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. On 1 May 1745, the King, with the command of a corps of 10 grenadier battalions and 40 squadrons of cavalry, ordered him to protect Bohemian mountain passes. He evaded the main Austrian army and joined the Prussian main army in time for the Battle of Hohenfriedberg on 4 June 1745. Subsequently, he was received as a Knight of the Black Eagle Order. At the conclusion of the war, Moulin received an estate in Anhalt as a gift. On 19 May 1750 he was promoted to the General of the infantry. On 12 September, on account of his poor health, the general finally asked the King for his release from the military service. Upon his retirement in 1755, Heinrich Adolf von Kurssel became proprietor of Infantry Regiment Nr. 37. On 10 August 1756, Moulin died after a long illness in Stendal. The family coat of arms can still be seen today at his house. Family He married Marie Sibylle von Huss (1699-1768), daughter of the city president of Magdeburg, Karl Adolf von Huss, on 19 July 1717, with whom he had two daughters and three sons (two of whom later fell as officers). His eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm du Moulin, was the chief of the Regiment Wiedersheim.

Plot summary Murder in Cormyr involves a wizard Benelaius and Jasper a half-halfling servant investigating a murder mystery in a village surrounded by a swamp. The book starts with the introduction of Jasper, a village urchin who, due to circumstances, tries to steal from the home of a wizard who recently moved nearby, as part of retirement from the Cormyr war wizard council. Jasper gets caught by Benelaius and as way of repayment, agrees to the proposition of becoming a servant of the wizard for one year.

Reception Gordon Kibblewhite reviewed Murder in Cormyr for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. He comments that \\"Murder in Cormyr is certainly better than the other fantasy mystery I've reviewed this month, Murder in Tarsis [...] - although that in itself is not a particularly remarkable achievement. Cormyr's strength is simply that it serves as a reminder that there is a certain amount of mileage to be had out of the fantasy whodunnit, after all.\\" He continues: \\"The story reads just like an age-old Agatha Christie-style chestnut given the TSR treatment. This time we have Miss Marple in the guise of a rather plump and bearded wizard, her earnest nephew becoming a halfling servant, and the predictably dim-wined detective, the captain of the local militia. The idyllic village (which is filled with all kinds of passionate intrigues, of course) is dumped in the middle of an enormous supernatural swamp. Add a couple of bodies for good measure, and it all sounds extremely promising, doesn't it?\\" Kibblewhite concludes his review by saying, \\"Unfortunately, it is not nearly as clever, involved or funny as it might have been. Terry Pratchett did a much better satire of the murder mystery with Feet of Clay [...] and while we can't demand writing of his extremely high calibre in books of this nature, this - like so many other game tie-in efforts - leaves you with the impression of it having been banged out, rather than thought out with any degree of care and attention.

Robert King, Jeff Grubb, Nick O'Donohoe, Don Perrin & Margaret Weis, Roger E. Moore, and Douglas Niles. Reception Jonathan Palmer reviewed The Dragons at War for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. He describes the anthology as \\"A new collection of tales to follow The Dragons of Krynn and featuring some of TSR's better known writers, such as Mark Anthony, Douglas Niles and including a collaboration by Margaret Weis herself. The lead is taken by Michael William's poem Dream of the Namer, which calmly sets the tone of the anthology, but this edition is essentially a showcase for up-and-coming writers and, unfortunately, they're not all particularly good. It's not that they can't write, but you get the impression they don't know what they should be writing about. There are good ideas, such as Jeff Grubb's 'gnomite', a rock, which when refined produces 'Plus-Gnomium': a pound of this stuff will produce an explosion capable of creating a crater half a mile wide and a fire storm of four to six miles across. The gnomes have developed cold fusion. This is an amusing tale, but some of the other tales, though they wander articulately, too often tend to go nowhere for 20 pages and then end.\\" He continues: \\"So, as you move from story to story, this produces a jarring distinction between those writers who are obviously comfortable in Krynn and those others who still have something to prove. Mark Anthony's use of the first person for the magic user, in the atmospheric People of the Dragon, is an example of the former. Some of the others leave you with the impression of having been produced by TSR's reserve team, though - newer, less experienced writers who will have to improve to make it in this genre. There are definitely some highlights among the tiros, though.\\" Palmer concludes his review by saying, \\"Janet Pack's Proper Tribute is a prickly piece about how the enmity between dragon and rider turns to friendship in battle, while Chris Pierson's first published Dragonlance story demonstrates the affection for Krynn he is reported to have had since he was 12 - we'll see more of him, no doubt.

Plot summary Tangled Webs follows drow wizard Liriel Baenre and Rashemen berserker Fyodor on a journey, which include escape from the Underdark and a sea voyage. Due to finding a mysterious amulet windwalker, Liriel stumbles upon a mysterious runecraft, which supposedly would allow her to retain her drow magic on the surface. During the hectic escape, she meets Fyodor, who also searches for the amulet, as the witches of Rashemen told him it is a solution for his own problem. As a berserker, Fyodor is able to call upon magic, which allows him to fight despite injuries. However, as a child born in Time of Troubles, he cannot control his rage and see a difference between ally and enemy. The two heroes make an alliance, travelling together to the land of Rashemen with windwalker, while avoiding forces which would claim its power for themselves. Reception Trenton Webb reviewed Tangled Webs for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. He commented that \\"B-movies aren't just fun because you can spot the wires, invariably predict the clich√©d plot and see the sets wobble from time to time. They're enjoyable because you get the feeling that the crew had a brilliant time making them. Tangled Webs shares this sense of tongue-in-cheek, self-mocking, gung-ho fun in a non-stop barrage of increasingly hostile situations hung extremely loosely around a sketchy plot. Liriel, the oddest Drow you ever met and Fyodor, her Beserker boyfriend, hex and hack their way through an overly long sea voyage from Skullport to Ruathym. The obligatory political intrigue is supplied by the conspiracies of the Northern powers of the Forgotten Realms.\\" He felt that \\"It's not the destination nor the schemes which are employed that are especially important though. It's the spirit that makes the book happen - the gut-spilling sword action, flashy spell casting and ensemble of characters pushes Tangled Webs from chapter to chapter with a wanton disregard for anything but having fun. The trip on the grand ship Elfmaid is made not just bearable but quite brilliant by the good Captain Hrolf setting up and solving all kinds of situations with a deft flick of a blade, a knowing glance or an impressive show of sheer bravado. His First Mate supplies sour-faced cynicism, and Xorsh the Sea-elf is your off-the-peg innocent. Together they roll across the ocean battling everything from Laskan pirates to vast Water Elementals.\\" Webb added that \\"With the principals foiling deadly threats at the last second while the supporting cast wander about inadvertently creating yet another world of trouble, each chapter of the book is an exciting adventure in itself. Unfortunately, some of the spells cast or actions taken are less than convincing, but nevertheless, it's pleasantly easy to get carried away with this wild romp.\\" He continued: \\"Sadly, the bubbling wave of ever-increasing adventuring energy falters short of the final chapter, which results in the villains it's taken Liriel 300 pages to meet being dispatched in a mere line or two. This really is a shame, because the archetypal adventure heroes developed in this book deserve a much bigger showdown, and these few lines seem woefully inadequate for the job at hand. What's more, these evil controllers of mighty magic and vast armies fought in the final battle prove less threatening than the ghoul on page four!\\" Webb concluded his review by saying \\"Purists are bound to condemn Tangled Webs for Liriel's complete lack of Drowness. DMs trying to run the new Forgotten Realms North campaign may well curse it for giving away too many secrets of this new land. Literature heads will no doubt have a pop at it because it's a Dungeons & Dragons book and not a proper novel. But if, when you're completely honest, you prefer B-movies to art-house cinema, then you should give Tangled Webs a shot!\\" References 1996 novels Forgotten Realms novels Novels by Elaine Cunningham ","title":"Tangled Webs"},{"id":"53353226","text":"Murder in Tarsis is a fantasy novel by John Maddox Roberts, set in the world of the Dragonlance, and based on the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game.

Rotting and falling apart, they form a labyrinthine warren that is the home of many a strange creature. This should make a good location for an adventure, so it's a shame that this potentially wondrous place, in the end, fails to live up to its promise and doesn't seem wondrous at all.\\" References 1996 novels Dragonlance novels ","title":"Murder in Tarsis"},{"id":"53353227","text":"The Rise and Fall of a Dragon King is a fantasy novel by Lynn Abbey, set in the world of Dark Sun, and based on the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. It is the fifth and final novel published in the \\"Chronicles of Athas\\" series. It was published in April 1996 (). Plot summary The Rise and Fall of a Dragon King tells the story of Hamanu. Reception Paul Pettengale reviewed The Rise and Fall of a Dragon King for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. He comments that, \\"Of all the AD&D; 'worlds' I've played in, the Dark Sun setting is by far my favourite. It has to be said, it does have certain moralistic overtones (the environmental ones are pretty obvious), and this novel continues the trend (it even has a dedication to all those millions who have died because of the intolerance of others). Exacting vengeance is what this particular tale is all about. That, and the dangers of power when wielded by the foolish.\\" He adds that \\"The basic premise is somewhat hackneyed. Chap's parents get killed. Chap goes after the killers. Chap becomes King of the World. Hmm, a rather grandiose leap there, but it all comes good (or rather bad) in the end, because Hamanu ultimately spells his own downfall through the execution of his extreme prejudices.\\" Pettengale concludes his review by saying, \\"All this makes for an interesting story, embellished by the lurid descriptions of the cruel world in which it is set, but it's all highly predictable in its outcome (and not only because of the name of the book). You just know that because the lead character gets way too big for his boots he's going to end up coming a cropper.

Despite the near-limitless powers that are now his to command, he is continually haunted by the death of his son. Unable to find any kind of happiness or contentment, he has begun to hate the dark, horror-filled world that is his to rule.

He commented that \\"Gene De Weese is yet another New York Times best-selling author who has been persuaded by TSR to write an AD&D-based; novel. The experience gained from over three dozen previously published horror, science fiction and non-fiction books has stood him in pretty good stead, and King of the Dead joins the ever-growing number of Ravenloft novels that are genuinely horrific.\\" He added that \\"Weese's clever manipulation of time and the order of events gives the reader just enough information to engender a sense of eerie foreboding and the awful inevitability of fate, without allowing the story to become predictable and boring - thankfully, you never really know what to expect next.

It was published in May 1996 (). Plot summary The autochthonous elves, driven back into the forest of Cerilia by the humans, who had in turn been forced out of their ancestral lands by lackeys of the Dark One, now live in uneasy peace with their invaders after centuries of war. The elves fear for the forest as the humans continue to carve out their civilization, but this concern is overshadowed by the matter of an empty throne. Reception Jonathan Palmer reviewed War for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. He comments that \\"Hawke seems to be building himself a soap opera here, one perhaps more like Dallas than anything else. The sequel to The Iron Throne [...] is aptly titled, but the plot of this new series of Birthright books is beginning to focus on what goes on in the bedroom rather than what happens on the battlefield. This writer likes to describe intrigue born of sexual power, blackmail and underhand dealings, and he interprets (probably correctly) civil war as a time for personal vendettas as well as national scores.\\" He continues: \\"Although this is 'Time of Legends' fantasy, there are a lot of parallels with the politics of the Arizona Indian Reservation where the author lives. Gannd, the son of the elf warrior Sylvanna and Lord Aedan of Anuire, is what humans pejoratively refer to as a 'breed' - half-elf, half-human. His character develops as he travels with the rather two-dimensional Reese. [...] And, if you don't want politics, Simon Hawke is also obviously an American football fan as one scene clearly shows.\\" Palmer concludes his review by saying, \\"Hawke's world is detailed and convincing. He writes with a languid confidence and the clarity not to confuse you with the intricacy of his plotting. The Iron Throne had an easier wit, but this is a commendable sequel and an inspiring read for anyone involved in a Birthright campaign. You don't need to have read the first book to enjoy War, because much of what has happened before is cleverly re-capped. But I would advise you to do so anyway, not because it has the same cover image, but because it's good and this series could go on for a while.\\" References 1996 novels Birthright (campaign setting) Novels based on Dungeons & Dragons Novels by Simon Hawke ","title":"War (novel)"},{"id":"53353254","text":"Flip or Flop Atlanta is a television series that originally aired on HGTV hosted by real estate agents Ken and Anita Corsini.

It is part of a larger complex which also comprises Rygaards International School. It was inaugurated in 1935 and became a parish church on 1 January 1942. History Rygaard before the changes a group of Assumption Sisters came to Denmark in 1908. They were initially based at Amalievej 16 in Frederiksberg and later at St. Andrew's College in Ordrup. In 1930 they acquired the property Rygaard on Bernstorffsvej in Gellerup. A chapel was installed in a room with high ceilings in the main wing. Mass was read on a daily basis from 13 August 1930.The plan was to replace the two side wings with a church and a residential wing but they were put on hold. The interior of St. Theresa's Church The plans for the construction of a church were revived when the Sisters celebrated the 25-year anniversary of their arrival in Denmark on 12 October 1933. It was announced that it would be dedicated to Th√©r√®se of Lisieux as the first church in Scandinavia. The architect Alf Cock- Clausen was charged with the design of the new building. Construction began on 3 January 1935 and the foundation stone was set by Bishop Josef Brems on 9 March. The church was inaugurated on 14 December 1935. St. Theresa's Parish was disjoined from St. Andrew's Parish on 1 January 1942. A residence for the pastor was built in 1954. The congregation initially had 350 members. The south wing was demolished and replaced by a new wing with class rooms, gymnastics hall and school kitchen in 1958‚Äì59. In 1988 the Assumption Sisters announced that they would leave Rygaard. Architecture The church forms the north wing of the complex. It is 35 metre long, 12 metres wide and 10 metres tall. Above the main entrance is a relief by Aage Nielsen-Edwin depicting St. Theresa with the cross. It was added in 1936. Six tall, rectangular windows are located on each side of the nave. The chancel is raised five steps. Furnishings The baptismal font was formerly located in Hornb√¶k Church. It was a gift to Bishop Thorvald Suhr who gave it to the church. It was restored by the sculptor Axel Theilmann. The baptismal dish is made of brass. It was designed by the Benedictians at Jagtvej and executed by Cissell√∏r Jetmar. The pews were originally borrowed from the decommissioned Rosenkranskirke in Vesterbro. The current altar was installed in the early 1970s. The first organ was purchased in 1944. The current organ comes from H√∂gser√∂d Church in Sweden. It was installed by Frederiksborg Orgelbyggeri and inaugurated on 24 May 1979. The church received a new statue of St. Theresa as a gift in 1952. It was carved in walnut tree by the sculptor Ejgil Vedel Smith. Another statue in the church depicts the Joseph and Mary with the infant Jesus. Today The congregation now has about 500 members above the age of 16 from 314 households. The parish has shared its priests with St. Andrew's Parish since 1989.

In 1910 he managed a cricket team that toured Portugal. He said in 1913 that he captained or managed about 60 teams in a season. He played in a variety of matches over many years for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and was a member of the committee of the MCC. He organised many of the MCC's matches and minor tours, including an annual tour in the Channel Islands. According to one obituary he played more games for MCC \\"than anyone else ever has\\". He served as the New Zealand Cricket Council's representative in London, and visited New Zealand during the cricket season of 1921‚Äì22 helping to organise a tour by an MCC team to New Zealand in the 1922‚Äì23 season. When the touring team was announced he was named as its manager. Before the tour Sir Home Gordon described Swan as \\"a man of colossal size, great enthusiasm, possessing fine knowledge of the game as well as a ready wit and imperturbable good temper. He should prove an outstanding [sic] successful feature of the tour.\\" He played in the opening match of the tour, against Western Australia, making his first-class debut at the age of 43. Batting at number eleven he was out for a duck in his only innings, and when he fielded his physique caused some amusement among the Perth crowd. After that he limited his activities to his managerial duties, and played in only one more match on the tour, a minor match in Nelson. However, he also played in the annual match between former students at British public schools and former Christ's College boys, held that year in Geraldine, South Canterbury. He returned to England after the tour to begin the organisation of the first New Zealand cricket tour to England, which it was hoped would occur in 1925. It eventually took place in 1927.

Biography Garrett, who preferred to be called Rafael, was raised in Chicago, where, along with musicians like John Gilmore and Clifford Jordan, he attended DuSable High School, studying music with \\"Captain\\" Walter Dyett. He initially started playing clarinet and saxophone, but later began studying bass after meeting Wilbur Ware. Around 1951, he met Muhal Richard Abrams, who credited Garrett with being a major influence on the direction that music in Chicago would take. In 1955, Garrett met John Coltrane while the latter was touring with Miles Davis. Garrett later told an interviewer that he and Coltrane had \\"been friends since 1955, and whenever he is in town, he comes over to my house, and we go over ideas.\\" (One idea that originated with Garrett, and that Coltrane liked, was that of using two bass players. Coltrane frequently employed two bassists in the early 1960s.) Garrett also introduced Coltrane and Abrams at around this time. Garrett worked as a bassist with Ira Sullivan from 1960-1962, recording Bird Lives!, and also played with Rahsaan Roland Kirk, recording Introducing Roland Kirk, and Eddie Harris, recording Jazz for \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and A Study in Jazz. During this time, Garrett also performed with the Ira Sullivan- Rahsaan Roland Kirk Quintet, which featured Abrams on piano, as well as in a trio with Abrams and drummer Steve McCall. In 1961, he played as a second bassist with Coltrane's group alongside Reggie Workman while the group was performing in Chicago. That same year, he was one of the co-founders, with Abrams, of the Experimental Band, a forerunner of the AACM. In 1964, Garrett moved to San Francisco, where he taught, organized concerts, and began making instruments. In September 1965, he reunited with his friend John Coltrane, whose quartet was playing at the Jazz Workshop. Garrett and saxophonist Pharoah Sanders were both invited to sit in, and then joined the band, accompanying it to Seattle, where the group performed at The Penthouse and recorded Live in Seattle followed by Om. The group then traveled to Los Angeles, where they recorded the tracks \\"Kulu S√© Mama (Juno S√© Mama)\\", first issued on the album Kulu S√© Mama, and \\"Selflessness\\", first issued on the album Selflessness: Featuring My Favorite Things. The following year, Garrett recorded with Dewey Redman (Look for the Black Star) and Archie Shepp (Archie Shepp Live in San Francisco and Three for a Quarter One for a Dime). He also played with Andrew Hill, Sam Rivers, and Leon Thomas while in California. In the early 1970s, he went to Paris, where he performed with Frank Wright and Jean-Luc Ponty. In the late 1970s, he met cellist Zusaan Kali Fasteau, whom he would later marry, and together they formed the Sea Ensemble. The group recorded three albums and toured widely, visiting countries in Asia, North Africa, and Europe. During this time, Garrett played a number of non-Western instruments, including bamboo flutes that he made. In the 1980s Garrett also recorded with Joseph Jarman (Earth Passage ‚Äì Density) and Kahil El'Zabar's Ritual Trio (Sacred Love). He died on August 14, 1989 in Champaign, Illinois. Over the years, in various album credits, books and articles, Garrett has been represented as having played bass clarinet. However, the authors of The John Coltrane Reference, who occasionally present updates to the book on their website (http://wildmusic-jazz.com/jcr_index.htm), provided an update dated 2008 which states that Dutch musician Cornelis Hazevoet sent the following information via an email to author Yasuhiro Fujioka: \\"Over the years, in liners, books and lists, Don Garrett has been attributed with playing bass clarinet. This is wrong. The man only played bass and clarinet (the small and straight horn, that is)... In 1975, Garrett played in my band and I've specifically asked him about it (because I already felt something was wrong with it). He most specifically and pertinently told me that he never played bass clarinet in his entire life, only the small, straight horn (which he played in my band too)... Perhaps, the error originated from the fact that Garrett was listed somewhere as playing 'bass, clarinet', which subsequently evolved into 'bass clarinet'. Whatever is the case, Garrett did not play bass clarinet on any Coltrane record nor anywhere else.\\" Discography With John Coltrane * Kulu S√© Mama (1967) * Om (1968) * Selflessness: Featuring My Favorite Things (1969) * Live in Seattle (1971) * The Major Works of John Coltrane (1992) With Kahil El'Zabar's Ritual Trio * Sacred Love (1985) With Kali Fasteau * Memoirs Of A Dream (2000) With Dexter Gordon * Jive Fernando (1981) With Eddie Harris * Jazz for \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" (1961) * A Study in Jazz (1962) With Joseph Jarman * Earth Passage ‚Äì Density (1981) With The Jazz Doctors (Billy Bang, Frank Lowe, Dennis Charles) * Intensive Care (1983) With Rahsaan Roland Kirk * Introducing Roland Kirk (1960) With Dewey Redman * Look for the Black Star (1966) With The Sea Ensemble * We Move Together (1974) * After Nature (1977) * Manzara (1977) With Paul Serrano * Blues Holiday (1961) With Archie Shepp * Archie Shepp Live in San Francisco (1966) * Three for a Quarter One for a Dime (1966) * Live At The Festival (one track) (1994) With Ira Sullivan * Bird Lives!

Lambert in 1920. Maurice Prosper Lambert RA (25 June 1901 ‚Äì 17 August 1964) was a British sculptor. He was the son of the artist George Washington Lambert and the older brother of the composer and author Constant Lambert. Lambert is mostly known for his public sculptures. He was also a member of the Seven and Five Society and The London Group. Lambert was Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1950 to 1958.  Early life  Maurice Lambert was born in Paris in 1901, the son of Russian-born Australian painter George Washington Lambert and his wife Amelia Beatrice Absell. He was educated at Manor House School in Clapham, London. From 1918 to 1923, Lambert was apprenticed to the sculptor Francis Derwent Wood. During this period, Lambert helped Wood complete the Machine Gun Corps Memorial now located on Hyde Park Corner in London. At this time he also helped in his father's studio as a painting assistant and model. Lambert became Wood's assistant in 1924. He attended Chelsea College of Art from 1920 until 1925.  Career  Lambert's sculptures were first exhibited at Regent Street's Goupil Gallery in the spring of 1925 where he showed mainly bronze portraits. As early as 1926, Lambert began to make sculptures incorporating the motif of birds in flight. He held his first one man exhibition at the Claridge Gallery in 1927. Between May and July 1928, the aristocrat and Bright Young Thing Stephen Tennant sat for a bust portrait by Lambert. Tennant, who owned the bust, was reportedly delighted with it, saying: \\"It is very startling...the fur collar of the coat looks like a huge dead snake, the face has a null, poisonous beauty that I like.\\" His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1948 Summer Olympics. Lambert's use of a wide range of materials for sculpture and carving was made evident at the 1929 New Sculpture by Maurice Lambert exhibition at Arthur Tooth and Sons, where he showed sculptures made from marble, alabaster, African hardwood, Portland stone and metal. Two of the sculptures Maurice Lambert produced for 33 Grosvenor Place. Lambert's fourth and final one-man show in his lifetime was at Alex Reid & Lefevre in 1934. In 1938 Lambert exhibited his portrait of the lutenist, Diana Poulton at the Royal Academy. Cast while Lambert still considered the bust unfinished, this piece is indicative of a looser handling of form as opposed to mimetic representation. Lambert later described this as one of his most successful works. In 1952 Lambert produced a sculpture for the entrance to the Time & Life Building at 1 Bruton Street, London. He was elected an RA in the same year. From 1950 to 1958, Lambert was Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1956 Lambert exhibited a portrait of the ballerina, Dame Margot Fonteyn at the Royal Academy. For this bronze cast at least, Lambert used the same foundry as the sculptor Henry Moore, the Corinthian Bronze Foundry. In a letter from Moore to Michael Ayrton the following year, Moore commented Lambert's sculpture looked 'awful' from photographs but that he never saw it in person ‚Äì though he notes that the casting must have been 'alright'. The figure was purchased by the Academy under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest. At the time, works purchased as part of the Bequest could be accepted by the Tate Gallery and included in their collection. However, the gallery refused Lambert's bronze of Fonteyn and it was instead loaned by the Academy to the Royal Ballet School. Lambert contributed six grotesque sculptures and two pinnacles to the headquarters of Associated Electrical Industries at 33 Grosvenor Place. The sculptures on the facade of the building depict angelic male figures wrestling with female demons. The spires are made up of stylised dragons coiled around armillary spheres.  Personal life  On 27 July 1926 Lambert married Olga Marie Stuart.  Death  Lambert died of cancer of the colon on 17 August 1964 at Guy's Hospital, London.

It is one of the main roads leading out of the city centre to the suburbs, stretching from the heart of George Town towards Pulau Tikus. This leafy road runs just behind Gurney Drive, passing by a number of well-known landmarks and shopping malls; the high-rises of Gurney Drive also line the northern side of Kelawei Road. As with Burmah Road, Kelawei Road passes through the suburb of Pulau Tikus, thus it has witnessed significant Eurasian, Thai and Burmese influences. A Eurasian community still resides along Kelawei Road to this day, forming the Penang Eurasian Association.  Etymology  There are conflicting accounts on how Kelawei Road got its name. Kelawei Road was purportedly named after the first river estuary west of George Town, which was then named 'Kuala Awal'. Another account stated that Kelawei Road was named after a Malay settlement that once existed at the road, and that the term 'Kelawai' actually referred to the roots of Myxopyrum nervosum, also known as 'pokok kelawai' in Malay. The Malay fishing village was, in turn, named 'Tanjong Kelawai', which gradually evolved into the current name of the road, Jalan Kelawei. Church of the Immaculate Conception was built on a piece of land bounded by Kelawei Road to the north and Burmah Road to the south. left left  History  Kelawei Road has been populated by Burmese, Eurasian and Thai communities throughout its history. In particular, the mainly Catholic Eurasians built the Church of the Immaculate Conception, as well as the Catholic Cemetery along Kelawei Road. The College General, a training institution for Catholic missionaries, also once stood along the road, before being relocated to Tanjung Bungah. Meanwhile, two Buddhist temples along Kelawei Road serve as reminders of the Thai and Burmese presence along the road. The Dhammikarama Burmese Temple was established by ethnic Burmese who had moved into the area in the late 18th century, with the temple being built in 1803. The Thais would later build Wat Chayamangkalaram on land donated to the Thai community by Queen Victoria in 1845. Up until the 1930s, Kelawei Road was the coastal road that stretched along George Town's northern shoreline. Gurney Drive only came into existence with the completion of land reclamation works in the 1930s. Today, the high-rises of Gurney Drive also have their rear entrances along Kelawei Road. The road has been made a one-way road since 2013.

It is a ground orchid with a single leaf and a single greenish-yellow flower with pale red stripes. It is difficult to distinguish from several other Caladenia species. Description Caladenia peisleyi is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single leaf, long and wide. A single greenish-yellow flower with pale red stripes is borne on a spike tall. The sepals and petals have narrow, dark red, club-like glandular tips long. The sepals and petals are long and wide with the petals shorter than the sepals. The sepals and petals taper to thin, thread-like tips. The sepals have dark reddish, club-like, glandular tips long. The labellum is greenish-cream with pale reddish stripes and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum have short triangular teeth up to long, decreasing in size towards the tip. There are four rows of calli up to long in the mid-line, near the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. This caladenia is similar to and difficult to distinguish from C. oreophila, C. montana, C. osmera, C. australis and C. fitzgeraldii which occur in similar areas. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and given the name Arachnorchis peisleyi. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2007 Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia peisleyi. The specific epithet (peisleyi) honours Allan Bertrand Peisley, an Australian orchidologist. Distribution and habitat Caladenia peisleyi is only known from East Gippsland where it grows in heath and heathy forest. It probably also occurs on the south coast of New South Wales.

Initially in Austrian service, he fought against Spain, France, the Ottoman Empire and against Prussia. One of Frederick the Great's trusted diplomats, Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, recruited him into Prussian service in 1750; subsequently, he fought for Prussia against the Austrians in the Seven Years' War and the War of Bavarian Succession. He was wounded once, and taken prisoner several times. The Prussian playwright Gotthold Lessing modeled the character of the sergeant in his Minna von Barnhelm on Werner. Imperial service Born on 11 December 1707 in Raab, Hungary, Paul von Werner entered Habsburg imperial service in 1723 and became a cornet in the hussar regiment of Franz Leopold von N√°dasdy in 1731, a lieutenant in 1733 and Rittmeister (captain of cavalry) in 1734. During his time with the imperial army, he participated in eight campaigns against Spain, eight against France, six against the Turks and four against Prussia. He was taken prisoner during the Battle of Bitonto in 1734, and fought in the Battle of Banja Luka (1737) and the Battle of Grocka (1739). In August 1741, Field Marshal Count Neipperg sent a petition to the Hofkriegsrat, asking for a promotion for Werner but it was refused. During the War of Austrian Succession, Werner continued as a Rittmeister, first at Battle of Mollwitz (1741) and subsequently in the Battle of Chotusitz (1742). In the Second Silesian War, he fought in the Battle of Soor in 1745, in the Battle of Roucoux in 1746 and the Battle of Lauffeldt in 1747. Despite his length of service and his unquestionable success as a soldier, he saw many men promoted to major ahead of him. During the fighting on the Rhine, he received a foot wound, his only serious injury during his long military career. In 1747, when he asked for a transfer to another regiment, N√°dasdy reported that he was not fit. Werner interpreted this as meaning that he was not religiously fit because he was a Lutheran in the predominantly Catholic Austrian service. Dissatisfaction with his lack of career progress extended throughout the war between Austria and Prussia and opened the door for other opportunities. These probably occurred during a spa stay in Karlsbad, where he met Prussian General Hans Karl von Winterfeldt. Winterfeldt fell into conversation with Werner and, during the course of it, learned of Werner's dissatisfaction with his lack of career advancement. Ever the opportunist, Winterfeld reported to King Frederick that Werner, at the beginning of the First Campaign of the Silesian Wars, had made a coup when, with 60 Hussars, he had routed several larger units. Subsequently, Werner entered Prussian service in 1750, where experienced soldiers were accepted regardless of religion. Prussian service Upon entry in Prussian service, Werner's career advancement became more regular. On 3 December 1751, Werner became a lieutenant colonel in the Brown Hussars Regiment No. 6 and in December 1752 he commanded the squadron formerly led by Lieutenant Colonel Otto Ernst von Gersdorf. By 1756 he was second in commend of the Brown Hussars in the army of Feldmarschall Kurt Christoph, Graf von Schwerin, who greatly appreciated Werner's prudence and vigilance. =Seven Years' War= Werner's first assignment in the Seven Years' War was to advance with 300 riders from Glatz around the rear of the Austrian army commanded by Octavio Piccolomini. During the invasion of Bohemia, he distinguished himself in the Battle of Schleissitz.. In February 1757 he became Inhaber (Proprietor) of the Brown Hussars and, in the Battle of Prague, he was part of the left wing reserve commanded by Hans Joachim von Zieten. In the final attack of the reserve, Werner's regiment formed the lead. In the Battle of Kolin, he was again on the left wing. After the battle, he was sent to Lausitz to join the army of the Duke of Bevern. Here, in action at Klettendorf, he routed two Croatian battalions. On 22 November 1757, at the Battle of Breslau, he was again on the left wing under Hans Joachim von Zieten, where he fought in the area of Kleinburg. In the Battle of Leuthen, he was able to defeat and disperse the enemy outposts commanded by General von Nostitz, including two Saxon and two Austrian hussar regiments. In September 1758, he was promoted to generalmajor and awarded the Order Pour le M√©rite. In October, the Habsburg General Karl Marquis de Ville laid siege to the Neisse fortress. Werner was part of the relief troops and he was able to break through Russian and Habsburg lines in the Battle of Landskrone. He then went to Kosel, which was also besieged. In the spring of 1759 he was able to drive General de Ville from Silesia. In August 1760, he was part of the relief army of Prince Henry for Dresden; on the way he defeated the Dragoon regiment Prince Joseph. For this he received from Frederick II the appointment as a provost in the cathedral at Minden and an endowment of 2,000 thalers. He was subsequently given the command of his own corps, and sent to relieve the besieged fortress of Kolberg. He marched the from Glogau to Kolberg from 5 to 18 September and upon arrival, he surprised the Russians by attacking immediately. The Russians were routed, fled their camp in a panic, and withdrew toward Russia. For this victory, he was memorialized on a commemorative coin. Werner received gold and twenty silver coins from the King. Subsequently, though, he was less successful: on 3 October 1760 at the Battle of Pasewalk, in Vorpommern-Greifswald, his troops attempted to storm the town and, although they took many prisoners during their attack on the redoubts, when darkness fell, Werner ordered his troops to withdraw. On 20 February 1761, the King promoted Werner to generalleutnant. On 3 September 1761, he captured a Swedish position at the village of Uckerland, taking eight guns and 600 prisoners. In 1761, he joined the army of the Prince of Wurttemberg, which was to resume efforts to relieve the besieged fortress of Kolberg but had hardly any supplies. In September 1761, Werner rode from Platens to meet the Russian troops moving westward from Poland. On 12 September, he fought with 2,000 men against the Russians at Treptow on the Riga river. After heavy losses, he was captured by the Russians and imprisoned in K√∂nigsberg, where he remained until the end of 1762. When Peter III became Tsar, he freed Werner, but tried to convince him to join the Russian army. Werner returned to Frederick's army in Silesia. There he again became commander of a corps, which first marched from Upper Silesia to Moravia, then joined the army the Duke of Bevern at Peterswalde in Lower Silesia. On 16 August 1762, he and Zieten routed an army of 47,000 commanded by Leopold Joseph von Daun near Reichenbach. He then moved back to Upper Silesia. After the war, Werner became the commander of Naugarten. Werner was memorialized on The Equestrian Statue of Frederick the Great. =War of Bavarian Succession= In War of Bavarian Succession, Werner commanded an observation army, which was reinforced by Lieutenant General Joachim Friedrich von Stutterheim until the arrival of the Duke of Brunswick, when the two of them shared the command. The greatest combat he experienced in this uneventful war was a skirmish at Teschen. Post-military life Gotthold Lessing modeled the character of the sergeant in his Minna von Barnhelm on von Werner: the character's name was even Paul Werner. The play was a characteristic Soldatenst√ºcke (soldier play) popular in the latter half of the 18th century - until today. In one amateur production a young Johann Wolfgang von Goethe played the part of Werner.Nisbet, pp. 351-358. Werner died on 25 January 1785 on his Bitschin estate, near Toszek, which he had bought in 1783. He was buried in the Franciscan monastery in Gliwice. His service was immortalized in 1851 on one of the honorary plates on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great, erected by the King's great great nephew, Frederick William IV. Family Werner's parents were the Habsburg lieutenant colonel Johann Paul of Werner and his wife, Marie Katharina von Streit. He married Maria Dorothea Apollonia of Shimonsky on 29 August 1756. Her father was Ludwig Jaroslav of Schimonskym, Lord of Prisowitz and Pojanow. Only one of Werner's five sons survived him: August Albrecht Joseph Ludwig Karl (born 23 January 1763).

Their genus name Zosterops likewise means \\"eye-girdle\\". The eye- ring of a bird is a ring of tiny feathers that surrounds the orbital ring, a ring of bare skin immediately surrounding a bird's eye. The eye-ring is often decorative, and its colour may contrast with adjoining plumage. The ring of feathers is sometimes incomplete, forming an eye arc. In the absence of a conspicuous eye-ring, the orbital ring of a bird is often referred to as the eye-ring. The bare orbital ring may be hardened or fleshy, or may form an eye- wattle. These are useful field marks in many bird species, and the eye-ringed flatbill, eye-ringed tody-tyrant and eye-ringed thistletail are examples of species named for either of these. Function Eye-rings are believed to convey various types of signals between individual birds. Some eye-rings appear only at sexual maturity, while others suggest the individual's age or health status. Individual birds may be included or excluded from reproductive capability due to signals conveyed by the eye-ring. Red carotenoid-based colors of the orbital rings of pheasants are known to be related to health. The function of the white eye-rings in white-eyes is unknown. It is suspected that they may serve to highlight infestations of small ectoparasites around the eyes. Untainted white eye-rings may consequently express vigorous health. In addition they may signal membership of a particular group or population, as different species and populations may have rings of differing colour, size, shape or completeness. These recognition signals could then play a role in reproductive isolation and speciation.

The strict contemporaneousness existing between this monument of Toledo, the Aljafer√≠a palace of Zaragoza (1046‚Äì1082), and the roofing of the church of San Mill√°n of Segovia (cut and put on around 1110) is shown by the fact that the large majority of the construction elements for the roofs and ornamental designs are practically the same on all three buildings. Various sources agree that the property was once owned by the Knights Templar, and it is said that it was used as a guest house in the 14th century.  Description  The most primitive elements of the whole are the remains of the hall of Caliphal time (10th century), located in the subsoil or basement, under the hall of the eastern wing. This hall has stucco walls and bicromo ornamentation, of Mozarabic reminiscent. It corresponds to an earlier state of the building, in which it would constitute the hall of the western wing of another courtyard located to its eastern side. The ground floor is distributed around the courtyard. From the 11th‚Äì12th century the hall, the alcove and the alpaca of the western wing are conserved, with its corresponding alfarje. It highlights the transformation of the arch of access, that leave of being an arch of gemade of horseshoe taifa to have a Mud√©jar yeseria, decorated with vegetal motives. In the hall of the southern wing, the most important modification consists of the suppression of the lower part of the facade, to realize in yeseria gable door, flanked by two lion protome and framed by double-arched stone, of horseshoe slightly pointed, which has two medallions with Castilian emblems. The whole ensemble is framed by arrab√° with kufic legend inscribed, datable at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century. In front, occupying the space that originally belonged to another room, we find the raised porch, with a terrace on the deck, made up of two factory masons (originally also covered with yeseria); They support a complex framework of carpentry, which imitates a thick beam, in which the suras III and XLVIII of the Quran are partially carved.

Douglas spent his early years at his family's home in Evergreen, CO, which later became the Hiwan Homestead Museum. He had two children with wife Freda: Ann Pauline Maher (1928‚Äì1988), David Douglas (1932‚Äì1999), and Eve (Mrs. Wallace Jolivette). Education He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1921 from the University of Colorado and from 1921 to 1926 studied Fine Arts at the University of Michigan and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Douglas married Freda Bendix Gillespie (1902-1979) in 1926. From 1926 to 1929, Douglas was primarily a painter and wood carver. He and his wife, Freda, went on a trip around the world in 1928. This trip helped to develop a lifelong love of world arts, especially Japanese prints, Balinese wood carvings, and Asian textiles. Douglas collected broadly in this areas, as well as American textiles and American Indian arts. Douglas received an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Colorado in June 1948 and the University of Colorado Recognition Metal in 1956. Career Frederic H. Douglas was hired as curator of [American] Indian Art at the Denver Art Museum in 1929 and was preceded by Edgar C. McMechan who was the first curator of Indian Art at DAM beginning in 1925. He served as director of the Denver Art Museum from 1940-1942. From 1942 to 1947 he held the title of Curator of Indian Arts at DAM. He served as curator of Native Arts at the Denver Art Museum from 1947 until April 23, 1956. During this time he was joined by assistant curator, Kate Peck Kent, who went on to become \\"professor emerita of anthropology at the University of Denver, a research associate at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and a resident scholar at the School of American Research.\\" Douglas created the Indian Leaflet series in 1930 which provided \\"summary accounts of culture areas and specific tribes alternated with comparative discussions of artifact types.\\" He also established \\"Indian Fashion Shows\\" (or Indian Style Show) that used clothing from the Denver Art Museum's American Indian collection that were modeled by \\"society ladies and Native Americans.\\" He presented this fashion show over 100 times across the country. He served as a Commissioner of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board (Federal Arts and Crafts Board) and as a trustee of a number of museums. Frederic Douglas, along with Rene d'Harnoncourt and Henry Clumb, was involved in the Indian Court, Federal Building, at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition during the World's Fair in San Francisco. He served as a commissioner of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board (Federal Arts and Crafts Board) and as a trustee of \\"various museums.\\" Douglas was enlisted by Rene d'Harnoncourt to design the Indian Art of the United States exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which opened in 1941 and included a major catalog written by Douglas and d'Harnoncourt. A joint statement by Douglas and d'Harnoncourt clearly articulates their position on invention, innovation, and adaptation of arts. They wrote: \\"There are people who have created for themselves a romantic picture of a glorious past that is often far from accurate. They wish to see the living Indian return to an age that has long since passed and they resent any change to his art. But these people forget that any culture that is satisfied to copy the life of former generations has given up hope as well as life itself. The fact that we think of Navajo silversmithing as a typical Indian art and of the horsemanship of the Plains tribes as a typical Indian characteristic proves sufficiently that those tribes were strong enough to make such foreign contributions entirely their own by adapting them to the pattern of their own traditions. Why should it be wrong for the Indian people of today to do what they have done with great success in the past? Invention or adaptation of new forms does not necessarily mean repudiation of tradition but is often a source of its enrichment.\\" Douglas was contracted to reorganize the exhibitions and collections at the Peabody Museum, Harvard University c.1950. He also regularly lectured at Harvard University, the University of Colorado, and the University of Denver. \\"With tremendous courage Eric continued his work despite the amputation of his left arm, intolerable pain, and the knowledge of imminent death from cancer. \\"Only two months before his death he went to Berkeley [California] to serve as a consultant in the planning of the building and the exhibitions for the University of California Anthropological Museum.\\" \\"In 1956, he was named honorary Curator of the American Indian section\\" of Nelson Rockefeller's Museum of Primitive Art (now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York). A book of ledger art drawings by a Cheyenne artist collected about 1865 known as the Frederic Douglas Ledger was once owned by Douglas. Pages from this book are now in the collection of the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire and the University of Iowa Museum of Art. Military service Douglas spent a brief time during 1918 as a private in the Infantry. He served in the Army Medical Corps from 1942 to 1944 in the Pacific Islands where he \\"expanded his interested to include the collecting of Oceanic Arts\\". He served as a captain and later a major in the New Hebrides and the Philippines, Luzon during World War II. At the time of his discharge Douglas was the rank of lieutenant colonel. \\"As registrar of the 31st General Hospital Unit he was the commanding officer of 130 nurses.\\" Publications Douglas's publications include: Indian Art of the United States (1941), the Denver Art Museum's \\"Leaflet Series\\", its \\"Material Culture Notes\\" (1939-1969). and Salome: a poem Death and legacy Douglas is buried at the Fairmount Cemetery, Plot 31.

Perturb-seq combines multiplexed CRISPR mediated gene inactivations with single cell RNA sequencing to assess comprehensive gene expression phenotypes for each perturbation. Inferring a gene‚Äôs function by applying genetic perturbations to knock down or knock out a gene and studying the resulting phenotype is known as reverse genetics. Perturb-seq is a reverse genetics approach that allows for the investigation of phenotypes at the level of the transcriptome, to elucidate gene functions in many cells, in a massively parallel fashion. The Perturb-seq protocol uses CRISPR technology to inactivate specific genes and DNA barcoding of each guide RNA to allow for all perturbations to be pooled together and later deconvoluted, with assignment of each phenotype to a specific guide RNA. Droplet-based microfluidics platforms (or other cell sorting and separating techniques) are used to isolate individual cells, and then scRNA-seq is performed to generate gene expression profiles for each cell. Upon completion of the protocol, bioinformatics analyses are conducted to associate each specific cell and perturbation with a transcriptomic profile that characterizes the consequences of inactivating each gene. In the December 2016 issue of the Cell journal, two companion papers were published that each introduced and described this technique. A third paper describing a conceptually similar approach (termed CRISP-seq) was also published in the same issue. In October 2016, the CROP-seq method for single-cell CRISPR screening was presented in a preprint on bioRxiv and later published in the Nature Methods journal. While each paper shared the core principles of combining CRISPR mediated perturbation with scRNA-seq, their experimental, technological and analytical approaches differed in several aspects, to explore distinct biological questions, demonstrating the broad utility of this methodology. For example, the CRISPR-seq paper demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo studies using this technology, and the CROP-seq protocol facilitates large screens by providing a vector that makes the guide RNA itself readable (rather than relying on expressed barcodes), which allows for single-step guide RNA cloning.  Experimental workflow  = CRISPR Single Guide RNA Library design and selection = Overview of Perturb-seq workflow Pooled CRISPR libraries that enable gene inactivation can come in the form of either knockout or interference. Knockout libraries perturb genes through double stranded breaks that prompt the error prone non-homologous end joining repair pathway to introduce disruptive insertions or deletions. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) on the other hand utilizes a catalytically inactive nuclease to physically block RNA polymerase, effectively preventing or halting transcription. Perturb-seq has been utilized with both the knockout and CRISPRi approaches in the Dixit et al. paper and the Adamson et al. paper, respectively. Pooling all guide RNAs into a single screen relies on DNA barcodes that act as identifiers for each unique guide RNA. There are several commercially available pooled CRISPR libraries including the guide barcode library used in the study by Adamson et al. CRISPR libraries can also be custom made using tools for sgRNA design, many of which are listed on the CRISPR/cas9 tools Wikipedia page. = Lentiviral vectors = The sgRNA expression vector design will depend largely on the experiment performed but requires the following central components: # Promoter # Restriction sites # Primer Binding Sites # sgRNA # Guide Barcode # Reporter gene: #* Fluorescent gene: vectors are often constructed to include a gene encoding a fluorescent protein, such that successfully transduced cells can be visually and quantitatively assessed by their expression. #* Antibiotic resistance gene: similar to fluorescent markers, antibiotic resistance genes are often incorporated into vectors to allow for selection of successfully transduced cells. # CRISPR-associated endonuclease: Cas9 or other CRISPR-associated endonucleases such as Cpf1 must be introduced to cells that do not endogenously express them. Due to the large size of these genes, a two-vector system can be used to express the endonuclease separately from the sgRNA expression vector. = Transduction and selection = Cells are typically transduced with a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0.4 to 0.6 lentiviral particles per cell to maximize the likelihood of obtaining the most amount of cells which contain a single guide RNA. If the effects of simultaneous perturbations are of interest, a higher MOI may be applied to increase the amount of transduced cells with more than one guide RNA. Selection for successfully transduced cells is then performed using a fluorescence assay or an antibiotic assay, depending on the reporter gene used in the expression vector. = Single-cell library preparation = After successfully transduced cells have been selected for, isolation of single cells is needed to conduct scRNA-seq. Perturb-seq and CROP-seq have been performed using droplet-based technology for single cell isolation, while the closely related CRISP-seq was performed with a microwell-based approach. Once cells have been isolated at the single cell level, reverse transcription, amplification and sequencing takes place to produce gene expression profiles for each cell. Many scRNA-seq approaches incorporate unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and cell barcodes during the reverse transcription step to index individual RNA molecules and cells, respectively. These additional barcodes serve to help quantify RNA transcripts and to associate each of the sequences with their cell of origin. = Bioinformatics analysis = Read alignment and processing are performed to map quality reads to a reference genome. Deconvolution of cell barcodes, guide barcodes and UMIs enables the association of guide RNAs with the cells that contain them, thus allowing the gene expression profile of each cell to be affiliated with a particular perturbation. Further downstream analyses on the transcriptional profiles will depend entirely on the biological question of interest. T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a commonly used machine learning algorithm to visualize the high-dimensional data that results from scRNA-seq in a 2-dimensional scatterplot. The authors who first performed Perturb-seq developed an in-house computational framework called MIMOSCA that predicts the effects of each perturbation using a linear model and is available on an open software repository.https://github.com/asncd/MIMOSCA  Advantages and limitations  Perturb-seq makes use of current technologies in molecular biology to integrate a multi-step workflow that couples high-throughput screening with complex phenotypic outputs. When compared to alternative methods used for gene knockdowns or knockouts, such as RNAi, zinc finger nucleases or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), the application of CRISPR-based perturbations enables more specificity, efficiency and ease of use. Another advantage of this protocol is that while most screening approaches can only assay for simple phenotypes, such as cellular viability, scRNA-seq allows for a much richer phenotypic readout, with quantitative measurements of gene expression in many cells simultaneously. However, while a large and comprehensive amount of data can be a benefit, it can also present a major challenge. Single cell RNA expression readouts are known to produce ‚Äònoisy‚Äô data, with a significant number of false positives. Both the large size and noise that is associated with scRNA-seq will likely require new and powerful computational methods and bioinformatics pipelines to better make sense of the resulting data. Another challenge associated with this protocol is the creation of large scale CRISPR libraries. The preparation of these extensive libraries depends upon a comparative increase in the resources required to culture the massive numbers of cells that are needed to achieve a successful screen of many perturbations. In parallel to these single-cell methods, other approaches have been developed to reconstruct genetic pathways using whole- organism RNA-sequencing. These methods use a single aggregate statistic, called the transcriptome-wide epistasis coefficient, to guide pathway reconstruction. In contrast with the statistical framework of the methods described above, this coefficient may be more robust to noise and is intuitively interpretable in terms of Batesonian epistasis. This approach was used to identify a new state in the life cycle of the nematode C. elegans.  Applications  Perturb-seq or other conceptually similar protocols can be used to address a broad scope of biological questions and the applications of this technology will likely grow over time. Three papers on this topic, published in the December 2016 issue of the Journal Cell, demonstrated the utility of this method by applying it to the investigation of several distinct biological functions. In the paper, ‚ÄúPerturb-Seq: Dissecting Molecular Circuits with Scalable Single-Cell RNA Profiling of Pooled Genetic Screens‚Äù, the authors used Perturb-seq to conduct knockouts of transcription factors related to the immune response in hundreds of thousands of cells to investigate the cellular consequences of their inactivation. They also explored the effects of transcription factors on cell states in the context of the cell cycle. In the study led by UCSF, ‚ÄúA Multiplexed Single-Cell CRISPR Screening Platform Enables Systematic Dissection of the Unfolded Protein Response‚Äù the researchers suppressed multiple genes in each cell to study the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. With a similar methodology, but using the term CRISP-seq instead of Perturb-seq, the paper \\"Dissecting Immune Circuits by Linking CRISPR-Pooled Screens with Single-Cell RNA-Seq\\" performed a proof of concept experiment by using the technique to probe regulatory pathways related to innate immunity in mice. Lethality of each perturbation and epistasis analyses in cells with multiple perturbations was also investigated in these papers. Perturb-seq has so far been used with very few perturbations per experiment, but it can theoretically be scaled up to address the whole genome. Finally, the October 2016 preprint and subsequent paper demonstrate the bioinformatic reconstruction of the T cell receptor signaling pathway in Jurkat cells based on CROP-seq data. While these publications used these protocols for answering complex biological questions, this technology can also be used as a validation assay to ensure the specificity of any CRISPR based knockdown or knockout; the expression levels of the target genes as well as others can be measured with single cell resolution in parallel, to detect whether the perturbation was successful and to assess the experiment for off target effects. Furthermore, these protocols make it possible to perform perturbation screens in heterogeneous tissues, while obtaining cell type specific gene expression responses.

Unable to start the car, he decides to look for help and finds two men playing the board game \\"Snakes and Ladders\\" and eventually becomes immersed in the game, which becomes (sur)real.

As he attempts to win the game, H realizes that the scale of the cartography of the board game is ever expanding. Whilst seeking to escape from his didactic nightmare of a real life dream, he travels across Paris, through France and Europe, around the Earth, and eventually to the cosmos. The short film was premiered on September 17, 1980\\"Release Info.\\" IMDb. IMDb.com, n.d. Web. 2 Mar. 2017. . on French television and was distributed by Gemini Video Editions. Later the film was distributed in Spain for viewers on February 7, 1997. Originally shown in French, it was later subtitled in Spanish, English, and many other languages.  Plot  \\"H\\" (Pascal Bonitzer) wakes up in his car, uninjured and with no signs of an accident. It won‚Äôt start, so he walks away. He tells two men playing a board game in a field that his car has broken down and he is late for an appointment; they offer no help. H asks how long they have been playing and the nearest man (Jean-Loup Rivi√®re) replies they have been playing a very long time. Asked if they should roll the dice, the man looks to the sky, carefully arranges the dice, counts the spaces on the board, and tells the other player \\"You have one hour\\". The male narrator says, \\"H realizes he is a victim of a nightmare\\", as H looks up and sees a hand rolling dice in the sky. The first man tells H where to go, the narrator saying, \\"H realizes he is the victim of the worst type of nightmare, _a didactic nightmare_ \\". As H and the second man move in accordance with rolls of the dice, a female narrator describes the game's rules. In Paris, a voice calls H from a warehouse; it is the first man he met. H, feeling that he is being played with, approaches the man who tells him he risks being late. Saying he wants to stop, H points to the board game's final square, but the man says someone is waiting for him at another tile; H hurries to his next destination. After he leaves the man reveals several versions of the game's board H is ignorant of. Another player in the game (also Jean-Loup Rivi√®re) advises H to always take unseen routes. The female narrator discusses how to resolve a labyrinth; a map enlarges one's field of vision to destroy a maze. As H travels, he meets a blind player who follows a sound map; the female narrator says such maps show travellers are going in the correct direction when the route follows a complete melody. Entering a church after the first man he met calls him from the roof, H realizes the church is also part of the game. Told that the board game's scale has moved from a district of Paris to the whole city, H is nauseous with vertigo and vomits two dice. Asked to vomit again so the man can have a turn, H says his ears hurt; the dice are in H's ears and he and the man hurry along. Called from a car outside the church, H climbs in and realizes it's part of the game. The female narrator describes three hypotheses: the map is old and the city has changed, making it inaccurate; the map is a developmental model of the city, which the city doesn't yet resemble; or the city has been destroyed and rebuilt using many maps, a combination of the first two hypotheses. Saying they need a perfect map, she suggests that either they create one using street-by-street analysis, making the map 1:1, or they create a map of all possible routes stored on videodiscs for the army or tourists/travellers. Meanwhile, H sees the first man in another car. H is told the scale has changed again and that he needs to go to the station. In the car's rear view mirror he sees new dice numbers reflected in his driver's sunglasses. On a train, H talks to the second man he saw playing the game in the field and discovers that all of the passengers are playing the game. The man tells H he is \\"the one who answers questions\\". H asks him \\"What is the connection between routes and maps?\\" but falls asleep; in his dream, H has a new nightmare in which dice are rolled and he is ordered off the train. H and the first man he met are in an aeroplane flying over Europe, the game's new scale, heading towards the Montfossis (fake mountains used by cartographers to converge two ranges on a map). H sleeps and dreams they are flying over maps in an exhibition and are travelling not in space, but in time. As they fly over multiple labyrinth maps the man says they are in the eye of the dice. A new dice rolls which changes the scale to encompass the whole planet Earth. H loses consciousness in the thin air the plane is flying in. Waking up sitting on a giant hand, H sees the dice and rolls them, but the hand closes in on him. As it opens, H realizes he is both the dice in the game he is in and also the player rolling them. H disappears leaving only the dice behind. The scale changes to that of the universe. As they travel the cosmos, a man tells him that they are not dead, but the Earth is because there is no more time and therefore no space. Observing the universe and the Earth, H realizes he is waking up but doesn't know which dream he will wake in. Finally, H is back again in the field where he first found the men playing the game.

London: Wallflower, 2013. Print. The film presents Ruiz's style when it plays with the ability to critique representation within film as the character H takes us through many representations of territory and representations of territories through maps as Ruiz uses cinema, dreams, and cartographic explorations (Goddard 4). Representation to Ruiz is a means to expose the invisbile and to put forward to an audience things which cannot be seen \\"using the capacity of images\\", because\\" they are too abstract or their nature is divine\\" so that they may be understood truthfully to reveal or render evident/certain realities which cannot be shown\\" (Ruiz 36).Ruiz, Rau√å¬Ål. Poetics of Cinema. Paris: Editions Dis Voir, 1995. Print. When the film uses these images of maps as representations of territories, Ruiz is able to challenge the logic of cartographers and how their representation may not be fully true, as cities may always undergo change and cities may be destroyed, or even both. In the film, it presents this paradox between territory and the image of territory showing us how territories and their maps are concrete yet abstract at the same time since a territory is physical and an image of the territory (map) is abstract or created, revealing the uncertainty of representation.Ruiz, Rau√å¬Ål, and Bruno Cuneo.

Construction  The Model 1934 was designed and manufactured by Ansaldo, while the Model 1936 was manufactured by OTO Melara. The Model 1934's made by Ansaldo were of monobloc construction with a horizontal sliding breech block, while the Model 1936's made by OTO Melara were constructed of two tubes, a loose liner and a horizontal sliding breech block. Both models fired the same quick firing separate loading ammunition. The gun mounts had electrically powered training, elevation and hoists. There were telescopic pneumatic rammers and each gun had a separate cradle. Loading was at any angle up to +20¬∞ for both the twin and triple mounts.Campbell, Naval Weapons of WWII, p.331-332. These guns were considered a significant improvement over the earlier 152 mm /53 Models 1926 and 1929 guns in that they had a lower muzzle velocity, were more widely spaced in the turrets and had separate gun cradles. This gun proved to be much more accurate than its predecessors, with tight dispersion patterns at distance using APC shells; substantially larger patterns when using HE shells were not attributed to the gun but to the shell shape, and work was underway in 1941 on a new design to correct this issue.

With over 4000 seats, it was the largest theater ever built in New York when it opened. During its brief existence, many prominent performers of the era appeared on its stage. It presented plays, opera, ballet, hippodrama, and circus performances in a space that was reconfigured several times. The operators always struggled to make money, however, and after twelve years the Broadway Theatre was replaced by a more profitable building, for the textile trade. The founding The original projector of the Old Broadway Theatre was Thomas S. Hamblin, in an agreement with James R. Whiting. But on April 25, 1845, just as Hamblin was about to begin construction, his Bowery Theatre burned to the ground, involving him in a loss of $100,000. At first he announced he was carrying on with his plan. Then he was publicly opposed by David Hale, editor of The Journal of Commerce and prominent member of the Broadway Tabernacle, across Anthony Street, which was used as a venue for concerts and other events. The New York Herald thought Hale objected to the prospect of competition so close by. Hamblin gave the project up. Col. Alvah Mann,Slout (ed.): Mann, Col. Alvah a well-known circus proprietor, then commenced the erection of it. After spending $14,000, he was obliged to call in the aid of James R. Raymond,Slout (ed.): Raymond, James R. a wealthy touring-menagerie owner, in order to complete the building. George Barrett was the initial acting and stage manager, and assembled the stock company of actors. On January 24, 1848, a few months after the theatre opened, Mann took a partner, E. A. Marshall, manager of the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, with \\"[t]he sole management of the Theatre, so far as its dramatic and theatrical arrangements are concerned, ... in the hands of Mr. Marshall. ... \\" Barrett left and was replaced by William Rufus Blake on February 21. The partnership was dissolved on October 25, 1848, Mann relinquished the building to Raymond, who held a mortgage on it, and Marshall became sole lessee and manager. He remained with the theater nearly ten more years. The building Map published in 1853 One writer called the location \\"the very best spot in the city. It is accessible by all the omnibus lines, in the midst of the hotels, on high and wholesome ground.\\" John M. Trimble was the theater's architect, and Addison Alger was the contracted mason and carpenter. The L-shaped lot had 75 feet on the south side of Anthony Street and the same on the east side of Broadway, the main entrance; it was 175 feet deep west to east. The fa√ßade on Broadway was three stories high and finished to look like stone. The upper stories each had six colored-glass windows. A balcony with thirteen large gas-lit globes overlooked the sidewalk from the second floor. (All the gas for the theater was manufactured in the rear basement from oil, to save money.) There was a square observatory on top. The Evening Post called the theater \\"a decided ornament to Broadway\\". The effect on entering the house was called \\"brilliant in the extreme\\". It was lighted by thirteen chandeliers, each under a colorful grotesque figure of a Moor in the attitude of feeding it with oil. The stage curtain was of fringed crimson silk looped up by cords, and the drop depicted a Swiss landscape. The ornaments throughout the theater were gold on a white ground, and the fronts of the boxes represented a chase beginning on the lowest front, and continuing on the other two, turning alternately from right to left and from left to right. The top of the stage was adorned with portraits of Washington and Lafayette with the arms of New York State and the United States. The orchestra pit, surrounded by an open balustrade, was twelve feet by twenty-seven, with a double floor and a sounding chamber to increase the body of tone, especially of the cellos and basses. The stage was ninety-five feet wide by eighty-seven deep, and forty-seven feet across the proscenium. The arrangement of seats was unusual for the period. The pit was transferred from the ground floor to the gallery (third tier), and in its place the inclined plane of the dress circle (first tier) was extended with the slope of an amphitheatre clear down to the stage. These seats were all entered from the dress circle, and cost the same price: one dollar. They were \\"well-stuffed sofas of luxurious width and inclination, leaving ample room between them for the 'largest liberty' of the feet.\\" One writer contrasted the \\"personal comfort and luxury\\" with the Park Theatre's \\"system of torture applied to legs and arms\\" and \\"old fashioned filth, darkness and discomfort\\", adding, \\"all that is over\\". The family circle (second tier) cost 50 cents and had 13 rows of benches. The third tier had \\"upper boxes\\", for which seats cost 50 cents, and the gallery, which cost 25 cents and had 20 rows of benches plus three additional rows, in the back, for African-American customers. The third tier included an unconnected female section with a separate entrance, on Anthony Street; the rest was for males. A newspaper editorial published October 2, 1847, addressed this arrangement in the context of sexual activity in theaters. (On October 18, 1847, prices for the upper boxes and gallery were reduced by half. On January 10, 1848, prices for the rest of the house were reduced by half, as well.) A large reservoir on the top of the building held a hundred tons of water, in case of fire.

Sometimes a new play or special production had a run of consecutive performances. A bill opened with an overture by the house orchestra and comprised a full-length play plus a curtain-raiser or afterpiece, and perhaps another musical, dance, or specialty act, as well. Sometimes the main piece was an opera or ballet by a guest troupe. Summers the company was off, and the house was rented to touring acts. The performers who played the Broadway were the same as those who played the city's other theaters, such as the Park, the Bowery, Niblo's Garden, and the Academy of Music. =1847‚Äì50= The first season began September 27, 1847, with The School for Scandal.

The Monplaisirs returned on July 6 for four weeks (sans Bartholomin), presenting the ballets L'Almee and Le Diable a Quatre. The stock company was not successful the first season; audiences were meager and the press critical. Edwin Forrest opened the second season August 28, 1848, in Othello. He played a total of eight weeks over three engagements during the season, in the roles of Macbeth, Virginius, Richelieu, Damon in Damon and Pythias, and Spartacus in The Gladiator.

Playing opposite Conway in the last four was Madame Ponisi (Mrs. Elizabeth Wallis), who made her New York debut November 11, as Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal, and was so successful that she was at once given \\"leading business\\". She held that position almost continuously until the house was closed. September 2 ‚Äì 7 Anna Bishop presented Judith. Collins played three weeks in two engagements. Sir William Don's American debut was September 28; he played for two weeks. December 16 ‚Äì 28 brought a ballet troupe, Celestine and Victorine Franck with Messrs. Espinosa and Gredelue.

Marshall's friends arranged a benefit for him at Castle Garden, August 12, 1851. It lasted from morning until late at night, and ticket-holders could leave and reenter at will. The next day, the report of this remarkable event took up two and one half columns in the New York Herald. Its interior entirely remodeled and renovated‚Äîthe parquet enlarged to more than double its original size, the lower tier of boxes rebuilt, new gas fixtures introduced throughout the building, and a new stage laid, among other alterations before and behind the curtain‚Äîthe Broadway Theatre opened for its fifth season on August 27, 1851, with Thomas Barry, formerly of the Park Theatre, as stage manager.

On May 2 a new and lavish production of Macbeth opened, with Forrest, Conway, and Ponisi; it played 20 nights. The season closed July 18, 1853. The summer season by the Williamses (July 4 ‚Äì August 6) was very successful. =1853‚Äì56= The seventh season opened August 15, 1853, with Forest Rose, by Samuel Woodworth. The Williamses played eight weeks over four engagements, with constantly increasing popularity; their repertory included Shandy Maguire. Julia Dean played six weeks over three engagements, including Isabel and Boker's drama Leonora di Guzman, both with Ponisi and Conway.

May 29 began three weeks of Faustus, with Charles Pope and Ponisi and Conway. The season closed July 8, 1854. (Putnam's Monthly disdained the building, its management, and its audience in a February 1854 article.) The eighth season opened August 21, 1854, with Barrett as stage manager, replacing Mr. Barry. Miss Davenport played two engagements totaling four weeks, in Camille and Adrienne and opposite Conway in both Ingomar and Evadne. E. L. Davenport played five weeks, two of them with his wife, Fanny Vining, who made her American debut (opposite her husband) March 2 in Love's Sacrifice. He performed as Richard III, Brutus, Rolla in Pizarro, Hercule in Civilization, St. Pierre in James Sheridan Knowles' The Wife, and William in Black-Eyed Susan, and in two plays by J. H. Wilkins, The Egyptian, and St. Marc, the latter with Ponisi and Conway. Vining played opposite her husband in Hamlet, The Lady of Lyons, Othello, Much Ado About Nothing, and W. Robson's Love and Loyalty. She also played a week without him, opposite Conway, in Romeo and Juliet, The Love Chase, and a new comedy called Charity's Love. A double bill of A New Way to Pay Old Debts (Davenport only), and Charity's Love (Vining and Conway) closed their engagement on May 26. Forrest appeared nine weeks in two engagements, performing in Pizarro, Brutus, The Lady of Lyons, and Coriolanus, among his other roles. William Harrison and Louisa Pyne performed twelve and a half weeks of opera, including La sonnambula, The Bohemian Girl, William Vincent Wallace's Maritana, Fra Diavolo, The Crown Diamonds, The Beggars' Opera, Guy Mannering, The Enchantress, and Cinderella. Agnes Robertson played three weeks, in The Maid With the Milking Pail, The Young Actress, and Asmodeus, as Carlo. She also appeared as Andy Blake, Don Leander, the Fairy Star, and Bob Nettles. Her husband, Dion Boucicault, appeared with her the last week. A Midsummer Night's Dream was revived for one week. Eloise Bridges began a two-week run March 12. The season ended on June 2, 1855. There followed summer seasons by Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams (June 25 ‚Äì July 31) and Gabriel Ravel et al. (August 6 ‚Äì September 15). The ninth season opened September 17, 1855, with Blake as stage director. Opening night featured E. L. Davenport in 'Richard III, with Charles Fisher as Richmond.

On February 18, the equestrian dramatic spectacle Herne, the Hunter, adapted by Mr. N. B. Clarke from an historical romance by William Harrison Ainsworth, began a three-week run, with a stud of horses from Nixon & Myers.Slout (ed.): Nixon, James M. This was followed on March 10 by The Cataract of the Ganges for one week, and then Timour, the Tartar was added to the bill (with The Cataract of the Ganges) for one week. Finally, a week of Mazeppa was given, ending the six-week equestrian run. The Keller Company, famous for their stage tableaux, appeared for two weeks beginning March 31. The Williamses played seven weeks, April 14 ‚Äì May 31, followed by three weeks of the stock company, ending the season on June 21, 1856. =1856‚Äì59= By that time, the fashionable residential, hotel, and theater district was moving northward, to the area of Union Square. Simultaneously, the city's burgeoning wholesale dry goods trade was expanding northward along Broadway from downtown, transforming the neighborhood of the Broadway Theatre. Owing to excavation for a new dry goods warehouse adjoining the Broadway Theatre on the south, its walls were dangerously undermined and new foundations were needed beneath them. The theater was therefore not ready to open for its tenth season (1856‚Äì57) until December 22, 1856. The opening performance was The Lady of Lyons with Claude Melnotte played by Henry Loraine, an English provincial actor making his American debut, as a guest. He played leading parts in repertory eight nights. December 29 ‚Äì January 22, a German opera troupe, starring soprano Bertha Johannsen and conducted by Carl Bergman, with Theodore Thomas as concertmaster, gave twelve performances, including Fidelio, Der Freisch√ºtz, Martha, The Child of the Regiment, Czar and Carpenter, and Daniel Auber's The Mason and Locksmith. Ticket prices were increased for the opera: one dollar for dress circle and a newly railed-off portion of the parquet. Forrest performed 23 nights, playing Sheridan Knowles' William Tell in addition to his other roles. The rest of his announced performances were canceled owing to his indisposition. January 26 ‚Äì February 13, Gabriel and Francois Ravel, along with Mlle. Yrca Matthias, the Martinetti family, and a pantomime and ballet corps, performed eleven times. Ponisi played Romeo to Mrs. Lizzie Weston Davenport's Juliet. Monday, March 16, saw the premiere of the \\"grand dramatic Eastern spectacular drama\\" The Usurper of Siam, with Sands, Nathans & Co.'sSlout (ed.): Sands, Richard. Nathans, John Jay. trained elephants, Victoria and Albert. The week of Monday March 30 ‚Äì April 4, the elephants appeared in a \\"Grand Divertisement\\" on a bill with a drama and a farce by the stock company. April 6 ‚Äì 17, The Last Days of Pompeii was given, including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. April 20, Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Davenport began an engagement with a new tragedy, De Soto, by the American playwright, George Henry Miles. The spectacle The Son of the Night played two weeks from May 4 through May 16, 1857. This was followed by a two-week revival (from November 1854) of the spectacle Faustus, which closed the (unprofitable) season on May 30, 1857. On June 3, a benefit was given to Marshall at the Academy of Music. The eleventh season began September 14, 1857, when Mathews began a critically acclaimed run of six weeks in two engagements. The Ronzani Ballet Troupe performed October 6 ‚Äì November 7. McKean Buchanan played one week. The theater was closed the week of December 7 to remodel its interior. When it reopened, on December 14, James M. Nixon was \\"equestrian director\\", R. White was \\"director of the arena\\", and Van Amburgh & Co. presented its \\"grand equestrian, zoological, and hippo-dramatic company\\". The Van Amburgh run closed March 31. On April 5, the house reverted to drama for a four-week engagement by Emma Waller and her husband, Daniel Waller. (The acting manager was N. L. Griffin and the stage manager F. C. Wemyss.) They closed May 1, 1858, and E. A. Marshall ended his association with the Broadway Theatre. It was then offered for nightly or weekly lease. A testimonial to Thomas D. Rice was held May 14, and a benefit for H. B. Phillips on May 22. Lola Montez lectured May 24 and continued for about two weeks, sometimes acting with A. W. Fenno. The house was leased by Edward Eddy, a popular actor who had the previous season managed the Bowery Theatre, where he had acted since 1851. He made considerable alterations to the Broadway and reopened it for its twelfth season October 18, 1858. Fenno was stage manager. The prices were: dress circle, 50 cents; parquette and family circle, 25 cents; \\"a new and commodious amphitheatre, comprising the entire third and fourth tiers, capable of seating 2,000 persons, 12 cents\\". The opening play was The Lady of Lyons with Eddy opposite Julia Dean Hayne, who began an engagement of three weeks. Hackett played November 8 ‚Äì 15, followed by Ponisi as Lady Macbeth, with Eddy as her husband. Barry Sullivan made his American debut November 22, playing various roles for one week. On November 29, Eddy presented the circus of Sands, Nathans & Co., which gave six weeks of ring performances, after which the company furnished the horses for a series of hippodramas: Putnam, the Iron Son of '76; Rookwood; Mazeppa; The Cataract of the Ganges; and Ivanhoe. Harry Pearson made his American debut on February 14, 1859, running one week, followed by Lucille and Helen Western, known as the Star Sisters, for two weeks. Closing and demolition At some point Whiting had acquired ownership of the building. On February 28, a newspaper reported he had decided to replace the theatre with warehouses, beginning the work in April. A four-week run of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra opened March 7, and the Broadway Theatre closed forever April 2, 1859. Demolition began by April 11, 1859, and was accomplished by June 11. The new warehouses were completed by June 9, 1860. In 1867 one writer summarized the theater's history this way: > By many it was anticipated that it would take the place of the old Park > Theatre in public esteem, and that within its walls, as in times gone by, > the wealthy, the fashionable, the intellectual, and the refined would seek > their amusement and relaxation from the cares and fatigues of the day. These > anticipations were not realized. It was never patronized by the best society > as a body, and a career of ten years served to dissipate all the popularity > it acquired in its earlier stages, while a year or two longer found it razed > to the ground ... .

She attended the University of Melbourne in 1989 and graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts in 1993 with a BFA.Sutton Gallery, Artist Profile: Kate Beynon.

Beynon‚Äôs work is included in public collections across the world.Anna, Edmundson, Kate Beynon‚Äôs where is your original home? (Australia National University Press, 2009.)  Artwork  Having immigrated to Australia at the age of four, Beynon experienced a hybrid world of two cultures. Beynon‚Äôs work is centered on her mixed heritage as an Australian with Welsh, English, Chinese, Malaysian, and Norwegian ancestry. Her art‚Äôs narratives are inspired by ancient Chinese myths, which she adapts and situates in the modern world.Brooklyn Museum, Global Feminisms: Kate Beynon (Youtube video, April 2010) At the start of her career, she experimented with Chinese calligraphy, questioning the notions of race and culture within her own family. Beynon also implements Eastern (manga) and Western comic book styles as a visual genre, and modern graffiti. Her interest in writing as an art form stems from her grandfather, who was a calligrapher and the last person in her family to read and write Chinese. Her first work, \\"the foolish old man moves the mountain\\", is a story taken from her grandfather‚Äôs book.Ashley Crawford, Exploring the passionate hybrid world of Li Ji (The Age, 2004) = Li Ji = Starting from 1996, Beynon‚Äôs work revolved around a fictional character named Li Ji. The character is a heroine adapted from Chinese mythology, who has been transformed to examine hybridity and race.Raymond and Smith, An-Li: A Chinese Ghost Tale The myth itself is an ancient Chinese story written by Gan Bao, who recorded extraordinary feats imitating historical writing under the ‚Äústrange tales‚Äù genre. The original story revolves around a young Chinese girl who steps out of her traditional, cultural role and saves her village by slaying a giant python.Deborah Hart, Tales of the Unexpected (National Gallery of Australia, 2002) The art critic Maura Reilly states that through Li Ji, Beynon confronts issues about multiculturalism and immigration in contemporary Australian society.Reilly, Maura, Curating Transnational Feminisms (Feminist Studies, 2010) p.170 Beynon‚Äôs work also tackles the modern issues of race and identity. In Where is Your Original Home (a video of Li-Ji journeying across a modern Melbourne Chinatown), Beynon explores the question asked to many non-Anglo Australians: where are you from? She deconstructs how a conversational question can turn hostile caused by the underlying assumptions about belonging.Edmundson, where is your original home? Beynon is also inspired by her personal experiences in other cultures. During her residency in Harlem, Beynon drew from the neighbourhood‚Äôs styles and tastes and implemented them into her depictions of Li Ji (i.e. African hair braiding.) This transformation of Li Ji reflects her fluid, hybrid identity.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest. CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complementary targeting sequence. The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to genomic loci. CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA.  Background  The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between Jennifer Doudna (University of California, Berkeley) and Emmanuelle Charpentier (Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Germany). The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the Feng Zhang lab at the Broad Institute at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells. By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published. Non- coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, genomic imprinting, and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.  Method development  CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location. Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by RNA polymerase III, which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR- Display incorporates RNA polymerase II to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80‚Äì250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization. The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a lentiviral vector. Transcription activator assay used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded. To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of luciferase and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a transcription activator assay was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) (Direct activation) or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA (Bridged activation). Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci. The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy. The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct. To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5‚Äô or 3‚Äôend or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex. This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90‚Äì4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), Xist A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator HOTTIP. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system. Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.  Applications  CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell. = lncRNA domain localization = CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA. Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR- Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements. = Artificial ncRNA functionalization = CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.  Affinity tagging for live cell imaging  One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.  Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation  Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins‚Äô and protein complexes‚Äô effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function. = Multiplexed functional studies = Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location. The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.  Advantages  * Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9. * sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used. * CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications) * RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5‚Äô or 3‚Äô ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function. * Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.  Limitations  * CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible. * dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure. * Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

The brand is marketed as a lower-calorie alternative, partially substituting sugar with stevia, a plant-based sweetener, and erythritol, a sugar alcohol.  History  The ice cream brand was founded around 2011 by former attorney Justin Woolverton of Latham & Watkins LLP. Woolverton had begun making ice cream in his own kitchen with the goal of reducing his consumption of carbohydrates and refined sugars. The company is currently run by Woolverton and Doug Bouton, President and COO. Woolverton met Bouton, another former attorney, in an amateur basketball league. By 2017, it had grown to 50 employees. In the early stages of Halo Top, Woolverton continuously experimented, tweaking and improving the ingredients for over a year. In order to create a long-lasting formula that could sustain shipment through the supply chain, Woolverton went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's Dairy Innovation Institute, where he was able to refine and polish the formula with a contract manufacture. Halo Top launched in Los Angeles on June 15, 2012, and is currently sold throughout the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. At a retail price of $5 per pint, Halo Top's annual sales grew up around 2,500% during 2016 and continued to increase in 2017. In July 2017, Halo Top became the best-selling ice cream pint at grocery stores in the United States, surpassing in popularity the Ben & Jerry's and H√§agen-Dazs brands, which previously held that distinction for years. The company describes its product as the first ever \\"lifestyle\\" ice cream that can be eaten daily without overwhelming a typical caloric intake diet, but nutritionists have expressed that \\"'just because it‚Äôs a slightly better choice does not mean that it is a good choice.'\\" Halo Top now offers several vegan/dairy-free flavors and has opened three physical locations, which serve scoop-based ice cream and soft serve.

He is the Stanford B. Ascherman Professor and Chair of Genetics and Director of Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.  Early life and education  Snyder was born 1955 and grew up outside of Pottstown, Pennsylvania. His father, Kermit Snyder, was an accountant and his mother, Phyllis Snyder, was an elementary school teacher. Snyder attended Owen J Roberts High school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. He won a Bausch & Lomb science award and attended the University of Rochester, NY where he received a B.A. in Chemistry and Biology. Upon graduation Snyder worked as a research assistant with Karl Drlica at the University of Rochester. Snyder received a PhD in biology from the California Institute of Technology, where he trained in the laboratory of Dr. Norman Davidson. Recombinant DNA was relatively new at the time and by using this technology to clone a set of gene encoding Drosophila cuticle proteins, Snyder discovered that related genes are often co-associated with one another in the genome (1,2). He also discovered one of the first pseudogenes in eukaryotes (2) and made the fundamental discovery that transposons often land in open promoter regions of eukaryotic genes when he discovered a new transposon, HMS Beagle, located in the promoter of an inactivated Drosophila cuticle gene (3) .  Career  Snyder completed his postdoctoral training at Stanford School of Medicine in the laboratory of Dr. Ronald Davis. There he was involved in several projects including establishment of successful cloning of genes using antibodies (lambagt11;) (4). The expression libraries he created were used widely by thousands of laboratories worldwide. Snyder moved to Yale as an Assistant Professor in 1986 in the Department of Biology. His laboratory worked on chromosome segregation and cell polarity for which he discovered a number of important genes involved in these processes (5,6). His laboratory proposed the first models by which eucaryotes select sites of cell growth (7,8). He was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 1994, and when the Biology Department split in the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, he became chair of the new MCDB department. During his six years as chair the Department doubled in size and tripled in research funding. He was also the Director for the Center for Genomics and Proteomics at Yale University. In 2009 Snyder moved to Stanford University to Chair the Genetics Department and to direct the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine. Since 2010 the U.S. News & World Report has ranked Stanford University first or tied for first in Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics. Snyder was elected and has served as President of US Human Proteome Organization (2006‚Äì2008) and Human Proteome Organization (2017-2018). He has served on numerous scientific advisory committees (e.g. EMBL Scientific Advisory Committee) and is on the Genetics Society Board of Directors (2006‚Äì2009). He has organized many scientific meetings. Snyder has been Principal Investigator of Center of Excellence in the Genome Sciences (CEGS) (2001‚Äì2011), NIH Training Grants in Genomics and Proteomics (first at Yale, now at Stanford) (2004‚Äìpresent), and is coDirector of the CIRM Center for Stem Cell Genomics and Director or the Center for Genome of Gene Regulation. He has been a Principal Investigator in the ENCODE project since its inception in 2003.  Research accomplishments  In addition to contributions to the field of cell biology, Snyder‚Äôs laboratory has invented a number of novel systems-wide and genomics technologies, and his laboratory has used these to make fundamental biological discoveries. =Systems analyses and Omics Technologies= At a time when most laboratories were studying one or a limited number of genes at a time, Snyder‚Äôs laboratory set up the first large scale systems project to study all yeast genes and proteins simultaneously using a transposon tagging strategy to analyze gene expression, protein localization and gene disruption (9,10). This was the first large-scale systems analysis of genes and proteins in any organism and launched the field of functional genomics. The libraries and approaches were widely utilized by many laboratories around the world and launched the concept of open sharing and reagents, prior to publication. With Dr. Patrick Brown‚Äôs laboratory, the Snyder laboratory invented ChIP-chip (11) (which they later morphed into ChIP- seq (12) to carry out the first genome wide mapping of transcription factor binding sites. Initially established for yeast(11), they later applied the methods to humans (13). This method was foundational for multiple multicenter consortia projects including the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements project (ENCODE; (14)). Their laboratory constructed the first human chromosome array (15) and later the first whole genome array (16) to map TF binding sites and novel transcribed regions of the genome. They later invented RNA-seq to better map transcriptomes, both protein coding and noncoding (17,18). Today, this technique is widely employed in the molecular biology field. With the advent of high throughput DNA sequencing technologies, the Snyder laboratory was the first to sequence an organism using such technology, at a time when most groups thought the technology was too error-prone to be useful. They sequenced Acinetobacter Baummanii, a human pathogen with low error rates (19). They invented paired end sequencing using new high throughput sequencing technologies (20) and used this to demonstrate that there was ten times as much structural variation (SV) in the human genome a previously realized and that most SV deletions and insertions were due to nonhomologous recombination, a surprising finding at the time, since most SVs were proposed to be due to homologous recombination events. Beyond the genome, the Snyder lab was also the first to set up protein and proteome microarrays for the large-scale characterization of protein function and antibody reactivity (21,22) . They demonstrated many novel biological activities of protein kinases and other yeast proteins and showed they can be useful for autoantibody profiling (23) . =Biological discoveries= Through their genomics efforts the Snyder laboratory has found that there are many more TF binding sites than were previously appreciated (13), with more potential regulatory sequences than RNA coding segments in the human genome (10% versus 3%)(24) . In addition to TF binding sites, the Snyder lab discovered that twice as much of the human genome is transcribed into the mature RNA (16), revealing the widespread occurrence of lincRNAs. These lincRNAs have since been shown to have a diverse array of interesting cellular functions. Much attention has been paid to understanding the differences individuals and species. The Snyder laboratory was the first to show that transcription factor binding sites vary greatly among people (25) and closely related species, demonstrating that much of the diversity among individuals and closely related species resides at the level of gene regulation (27,28), rather than the genes themselves. Much of this variation resides in distal regulatory elements called enhancers. =Omics profiling and data driven medicine= Using the same in-depth omics approaches he applied to yeast, upon his move to Stanford in 2009, Snyder began to apply systems-wide analysis to human health (29). The Snyder laboratory carried out the first deep longitudinal profiling of one person using multi-'omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.). This deep profiling used genomics for the first time to predict disease risk and follow disease onset at a level not previously achieved (29). This work was recognized as a landmark paper in the journal Cell's 40th anniversary celebration in 2012. This approach of collecting longitudinal deep data on humans is now being applied by many groups worldwide. The Snyder lab has recently demonstrated that self-tracking using wearable biosensor can be used for monitoring health and illness (30) . Together these studies demonstrate the power of using longitudinal tracking and big data to manage human health.  Entrepreneur  Snyder has been a co-founder of a number of Biotechnology companies. These include: Exelixis, Protometrix (purchased by Life Technologies, now part of Thermo Fisher), Affomix (purchased by Illumina), Personalis, SensOmics and is founder of Qbio.

During periods of extended rainfalls, the water level in the EDWC tends to rise above the maximum safe storage level. This excess volume of water in the conservancy causes an increase in lateral pressure acting on the earthen embankment. This will eventually create failure; which will result in catastrophic floods, causing damages to both Agricultural and Residential areas. In the year 2005, there was a breach in the embankment which resulted in floods to almost the entire East Coast of Demerara. This was caused by the excess water in the EDWC. The EDWC NRC (Hope Canal) project was designed in response to the 2005 floods. This canal serves as a medium to release excess water from the EDWC directly to the Atlantic Ocean, during periods of extended rainfall in order to prevent overtopping of conservancy embankment. Construction of the Northern Relief Channel and Associated Drainage Structures Started on May 4, 2011 and concluded on November 9, 2013.  EDWC-NRC Associated Structures  There are four major components of the Hope Canal Project: =1. The Head Regulator= The head regulator is an intake structure located at the Southern end of the canal. It consist of a sluice with three green heart timber doors. This sluice allows excess water to flow from the EDWC into the Hope Canal. It is manually operated, and water levels in the canal can be monitored by lowering or rising sluice doors. This structure is 17m across, with the three doors measuring 5.5m each. There is also be a bridge spanning the channel at the structure; this bridge is 5m wide and 18m long. The wing walls of the structure are reinforced with geotextile fabric and the channel bed is protected both at the inlet and outlet sides of the structure by gabion mattresses, extending several metres outwards. Water Levels in the canal can be determined by graduated gauges (Unit being Ft GD) placed at specific locations in both the Hope Canal and the EDWC. Construction of the Conservancy Head Regulator for the Northern Relief Channel started on August 8, 2011 and concluded on December 15, 2013. The construction of this structure was undertaken by recognized contracting firm BK International. The cost of the project was G$420,796,867. =2. The High Level Sluice= This structure is located at the Northern end of the Hope Canal, leading to the Atlantic Ocean. Excess water that entered the Hope Canal through the Head Regulator is conveyed to this structure which discharges directly into the Ocean. It consist of a drainage sluice with eight (8) doors. The overall width of the structure is 89.5m with the eight doors at each 4.875m in width. At the base of the gates there is a high level weir at 16.0mGD level in contrast to the 14.0mGD invert channel depth. This feature, along with the enormous size, discharge capacity, advanced motorized winches and control systems are what makes this structure different from the common sluices. The High Level Sluice is the largest sluice in Guyana. The construction of this structure was undertaken by Courtney Benn Contracting Services Ltd (CBCSL) Construction started on August 8, 2011 and was concluded on December 15, 2013 Total Cost of this Project was G$605,430,630. =3. The Public Road Bridge= At the point where the channel passes through the East Coast Public Road, a reinforced concrete bridge was constructed to close the gap. In an effort to maintain the integrity of the dam throughout the entire length of the channel, the bridge was constructed in such a manner as to go up and over the embankments. The bridge consist of two 47m sloped approach on both sides, along with the length of the deck being 74.4m. The bridge is designed to accommodate two lanes of traffic as well as protected sidewalks on both sides for pedestrians. The construction of the Public Road Bridge was undertaken by DIPCON Engineering. Construction Started on August 8, 2011 and ended on December 15, 2013. Project Cost: G$349,654,353 = 4. The Canal = The channel has a length of 10.3 km and entirely straight with a bed width of 30m and a top width of 40m; the embankments are at least 8m higher than the surrounding land areas and the width across the top of the embankments is 5m. During the construction, there were 18 hydraulic excavators and 1 bulldozer working full-time and it is estimated that approximately 660,520 cubic metres of soil had been excavated. This excavated soil was then used for the construction of the channel embankments. Excavation had to be done through areas where the soil composition varied in the different strata from stiff clay to organic matter. However, organic matter is not suitable for earthen construction and as a result of this, added precautions had been taken into consideration in the design phase to ensure that the integrity of the embankments are maintained even under the harshest of conditions. As such a geotextile fabric was used within the embankment for added strength. The Hope Channel has a carrying capacity of 58 cubic metres per second and serves to drain the EDWC of excess water. The Conservancy is connect to the Channel through the three door Head Regulator and the water drains at the Northern end of the Channel through the eight door High Level Outfall Sluice. Construction of the Canal itself was executed by the National Drainage and Irrigation Authority.

This period falls under the Anatolian Bronze Age. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. > ‚ÄúOwing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention > for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating > the units to form more complex compositions\\" Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of Hittite deities and ritual practices. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like Alaca H√∂y√ºk, or the Hittite capital of Hattusa near modern- day Boƒüazkale. Scholars do have difficulty dating a large portion of Hittite art, citing the fact that there is a lack of inscription and much of the found material, especially from burial sites, was moved from their original locations and distributed among museums during the nineteenth century. However, larger period groupings have been established by some, including the Colony Age, the Hittite Old Kingdom Era, and the period of the Hittite Empire.  The Colony Age  Historians refer to the period around the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries B.C.E. as the Colony Age, before a larger Hittite Kingdom was established in the region. Groups in settlements of this period included Hattians, Hurrians, and Assyrians living in trading colonies, which the Hittites took control of when they moved into the area. The art style of this time involved assimilation of previous Anatolian symbols and sensibilities. Before this period and during the third millennium, art in ancient Anatolia consisted of rather flat representations of human figures found at burial sites. This was emulated in Hittite ivories like one of a young girl, half seated, cupping her breasts, and wearing a traditional cap. Most of the objects available from the second millennium come in the mediums of carved ivories, baked clay, and small seals. A group of ivories from Acemh√∂y√ºk, now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York, includes a small sphinx with long curls of hair over its chest that art historians refer to as Hathor curls. As for seals, while there were more traditional cylinder seals, the composition of these Hittite stamp seals did not include a ground-line, and thus the figures are free floating. Deities have been identified such as weather gods who stand on bulls or mountains. This image is repeated in later Imperial rock reliefs. Hittite people of the Colony Age took on and incorporated the motifs from the previous civilizations they asserted control over, mimicking indigenous art styles, including in the depiction of animals such as deer, lions, bulls, and raptors like eagles. A common piece is animal- shaped rhytons, or drinking vessels, which could be sculpted out of clay or later metalwork. The raptors in particular are exceptionally well-shaped. The H√ºseyindede vases are examples of a type of elaborate pottery vase with animal figures and other decoration in relief; other pieces in this style have been found. Ivory Hittite Sphinx, 18th century B.C.E.  Old Hittite Kingdom  Moving into the seventeenth century when the Hittites formed a larger state with their capital at Hattusa, the art style began incorporating larger and more permanent pieces such as stone reliefs in addition to the continuing tradition of seals. In more recent years, pieces that were thought to belong to this period have been moved to the Empire period, and it may be that some Empire works are actually from the Hittite Old Kingdom. Hittite seals could be made of anything from baked clay to gold. In addition to surviving objects, some knowledge of these seals also comes from the impressions they left on ceramics. Figures in the Old Kingdom period became more wiry, and were depicted in more violent situations. This is true for seals, reliefs, and small 3-dimensional figures. A common subject for art at this time was conflict among divine figures and struggles for power, which was not represented as much during the Hittite Empire. Other scenes, like one relief on the neck of a silver rhyton housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depict gods during hunts. There is a sense of temporal progression in the images of this piece, as there is a deer living and being confronted, and then lying conquered and prone further along the rim. There is also an assumption of spiritual connotations in this piece in regards to a \\"Protector God of the Wild Fields\\".  Hittite Empire  Scene from Alaca H√∂y√ºk Sphinx Gate Beginning in the fourteenth century and lasting into the twelfth century, this period saw even more creation of large-scale relief sculpture, and figures represented tend to be more solid, with thicker proportions. Much of the art found from the Hittite Empire Period comes from the settlement of Alaca H√∂y√ºk. It is unclear which ancient city this correlates to, however it has been argued that it could be Tawiniya, Arinna, Hanhana, or Zippalanda. The most common opinion among scholars is that it is the holy city of Arinna, because of its proximity to the capital of Hattusa and the ritual practices depicted in art there. A much-studied monument in this area that is argued to have been constructed at this time is a stone gate flanked by two carved sphinxes and cyclopean blocks covered in unfinished reliefs of a religious procession and hunting scenes. This procession depicts Hittite royalty and six priests approaching a god in the form of a bull, and a cast of entertainers including acrobats and jesters on ladders. The hunting scenes are on blocks directly above this procession. However, there is disagreement among scholars as to the exact construction date of this structure. Some place it between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, while others argue that it belongs in the second half of the thirteenth century. The guardians wear the long Hathor curls common to Hittite sphinxes since at least the eighteenth century BCE and were carved out of single blocks of stone 13 ft high and 6.5 ft thick. Another monument is the King's Gate leading into the temple district of in the upper city of Hattusa. Here a low relief of a god, 7 ft tall, looms. Other reliefs of the Hittite exist on non-man-made structures. While some Hittite rock reliefs do not have inscriptions, and thus are difficult to date, others can be attributed to the reigns of specific kings such as ·∏™attu≈°ili III, or Muwatalli II. Relief scenes from ancient Sam'al, in modern Zincirli H√∂y√ºk, include a procession of gods on one wall and an image of a king named Tud·∏´aliya on the wall opposite it. There are a number of large recumbent lions in stone, of which the Lion of Babylon statue at Babylon is the largest, if it is indeed Hittite. The ceramic works produced at this time, apart from rare decorative pieces, was mainly plain with simple forms and a focus on utility and function. Hittites did make use of potter's wheels, as well as the free sculpting of more animalistic forms. The forms and production methods were fairly consistent across the Empire. A piece from the village of Gordion, on the fringes of the Empire, could greatly resemble a piece from the capital, Hattusa. A small stone seal bearing Hittite hieroglyphics has been discovered in Megiddo, indicating trade outside the Empire. It also confirms the diplomatic ties with Egypt indicated by the Hittite-Egyptian Treaty, since Megiddo is an important stopping point for ambassadorial messengers between the two regions. Neo-Hittite After the fall of the Hittite Empire many aspects of Hittite art and culture continued in smaller city-states in south- eastern Anatolia, as well as modern northern Iraq and most of Syria; Carchemish was the largest of these. Older Hittite elements were increasingly mixed with Assyrian and other influences. The terms \\"Late Hittite\\", \\"Neo- Hittite\\" and \\"Syro-Hittite\\" are all used to describe this period and its art, which lasted until the states were conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, by around 800 BCE.Gilibert, 2 This period marked the transition into the Iron Age, beginning around 1200 BCE in this region.Gilibert, 5-6 Although the states were much smaller, public sculpture increased, with many statues, and ceremonial exterior paths lined with orthostats or stone slabs carved with reliefs.Gilibert, 60-67 Rock reliefs Hittite deities at Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya The Hittites were important producers of rock reliefs, which form a relatively large part of the few artistic remains they have left.Bonatz The Karabel relief of a king was seen by Herodotus, who mistakenly thought it showed the Egyptian Pharaoh Sesostris.Harman≈üah (2014a), 88‚Äì89; Livius.org on \\"The relief of Sesostris\\" in Herodotos' Histories 2.102‚Äì103, 106 This, like many Hittite reliefs, is near a road, but actually rather hard to see from the road. There are more than a dozen sites, most over 1000 metres in elevation, overlooking plains, and typically near water. These perhaps were placed with an eye to the Hittite's relation to the landscape rather than merely as rulers' propaganda, signs of \\"landscape control\\", or border markers, as has often been thought.Harman≈üah (2014a), 90‚Äì94; Ullmann, Lee Z., in Harman≈üah (2014), Chapter 8; though see also Bonatz They are often at sites with a sacred significance both before and after the Hittite period, and apparently places where the divine world was considered as sometimes breaking through to the human one.Harman≈üah (2014a), 92 At Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya, just outside the capital of Hattusa, a series of reliefs of Hittite gods in procession decorate open-air \\"chambers\\" made by adding barriers among the natural rock formations. The site was apparently a sanctuary, and possibly a burial site, for the commemoration of the ruling dynasty's ancestors. It was perhaps a private space for the dynasty and a small group of the elite, unlike the more public wayside reliefs. The usual form of these is to show royal males carrying weapons, usually holding a spear, carrying a bow over their shoulder, with a sword at their belt. They have attributes associated with divinity, and so are shown as \\"god-warriors\\". Other rock reliefs include the ƒ∞vriz relief, Manisa relief, Hanyeri relief, Fƒ±raktƒ±n relief, G√∂kbez relief, ƒ∞mamkullu relief, and Hemite relief.

Design and development  Gothaer Waggonfabrik, which was selected to mass-produce the Horten Ho 229 as the Go 229, began work on an improved version of the aircraft after discovering flaws with the Horton flying wing. These flaws included limited space for modifications, especially new engines, or extra crew, as well as instability. The company proposed the Go P.60A in January 1945. The Go P.60A was to have two BMW 003A-1 turbojet engines, one mounted above the wing and one below. This arrangement was chosen for ease of maintenance as well as to simplify the process of installing other engines. Two pilots would occupy the pressurized cockpit in a staggered prone position. The nose gear was offset to the left of the cockpit and retracted rearward. Yaw control was to have been provided by a pair of retractable drag rudders near the tip of each wing. Three armament configurations were proposed, a high altitude fighter (H√∂henj√§ger) with four MK 108 cannons, a heavy fighter (Zerst√∂rer) with two MK 103 cannons, and a reconnaissance fighter (Aufkl√§rer) with two MK 108 cannons and two cameras. The RLM rejected Gotha's proposal, and instead ordered more Go 229s. However, work on a simplified version as the Go P.60B continued. This version differed from the Go P.60A in that the two crew sat in a conventional cockpit. The drag rudders of the original design were replaced with more conventional units, and the nose gear leg was relocated to the centerline. Power was to be provided by two Heinkel HeS 011 engines, and armament was to consist of four MK 108 cannons. Construction of the prototype was halted midway in favor of the Go P.60C. The Go P.60C was proposed as a night fighter variant. A radar was to be fitted in a lengthened nose, and three upward- firing MK 108 cannons would have complemented the four cannons of the previous model. Power was to be provided by a pair of either BMW 003 or HeS 011 engines, complemented by a single Walter HWK solid-fueled booster rocket. Work on the Go P.60 was halted by the end of the war in Europe.  Variants  Go P.60A, initial version featuring a prone cockpit and two BMW 003A-1 engines mounded in an over/under position.

Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 37(6,Supplement). Description =Skull= A lower right left Cranial bones recovered from the Manda Beds consist of a badly crushed orbito-ethmoidal region, a practically complete right mandible, two fragments of the left mandible, several loose teeth, a portion of the occiput, and several unidentified fragments. In the upper jaw, only the posterior ends of the maxillae, a portion of the palate, and the floor of the orbits are well preserved. The maxillary postcanines are transversely ovate and have three main cusps arranged upon the same transverse plane. The three main cusps are composed of the lingual, central, and labial cusp. There are also small peripheral cuspules present on the anterior and posterior borders of the crown. Roots of the upper postcanines are long, transversely flattened near the crown and taper away to a short point distally. The maximum known transverse diameter of the maxillary postcanines is 13mm. A characteristic feature of the mandible is the sharp angle formed by the junction of the lower margin of the dentary and the anterior surface of the dental symphysis. A diagnostic difference between the upper jaw postcanine teeth and mandibular postcanine teeth is that mandibular postcanine teeth tend to be squarer in horizontal sections in contrast to the transversely ovate maxillary postcanines. A mammalian feature that can be seen in gomphodont cynodonts is that each root is surrounded by a pocket of cancellous bone. The maximum transverse diameter of the mandibular postcanines is 9mm. The main cusps of the mandibular and maxillary postcanines form a transverse ridge across the center of the crown. The transverse ridge of a tooth would fit into the depression formed between the transverse ridges of two adjoining teeth. Recent research conducted by Hendrickx, Abdala, and Choiniere (2016) has revealed new information in regard to the distribution of enamel microstructure in non- mammaliform cynodonts, specifically in Cricodon metabolus. Their research uncovered the presence of columnar divergence units in both the sectorial and gomphodont teeth of a trirachodontid along with the consistent presence of synapsid columnar enamel in cynognathians.Hendrickx, C., Abdala, F., & Choiniere, J. (2016). Postcanine microstructure in Cricodon metabolus, a Middle Triassic gomphodont cynodont from south-eastern Africa. Palaeontology, 59(6), 851-861. The newfound discovery in regards to the thickened enamel has many ecological implications. In Cricodon metabolus, the enamel layer of the gomphodont tooth is around 11.5 times thicker than the sectorial tooth. The postcanine gomphodont teeth (labiolingually expanded teeth with large occlusal surfaces) were used for chewing, crushing, and grinding fibrous plant material, meaning that they were under higher loads and apically oriented stresses. Sectorial teeth on the other hand were used to shear plant material and were not subjected to the same types of occlusal stresses, therefore the enamel thickness was not maintained. Another reason proposed by Hendrickx, Abdala, and Choiniere (2016) to explain the thin enamel in sectorial teeth is due to replacement timing and patterns, as they will be sequentially replaced by gomphodont teeth. Another characteristic that was observed in the gomphodont teeth were enamel and dentine incremental lines. The enamel and dentine incremental lines, odontoblast tubules in dentine, and discontinuous columnar divergence units in enamel support the consistent presence of synapsid columnar enamel in Cynognathia. =Postcranial skeleton= An array of various postcranial bones of Cricodon metabolus Twenty-five vertebrae were discovered which belong to the dorsal and sacral regions with only one vertebrae having a well preserved neural arch from the sacral region. There are additional apophyses below the posterior zygapophysis which articulate with concavities on the lateral surface of the neural arch, posterior and inferior to the anterior zygapophysis. Cricodon metabolus has the typical cynodont expanded ribs of which thirteen dorsal ribs were discovered. The entire humerus was 12.5 cm long and had typical cynodont characterizations such as the twisted bone and the plane of the distal end forming an angle of 40 degrees with that of the proximal. The discovered femur was 12.5 cm long with the capitulum directed at an angle of 45 to 50 degrees to the main axis of the slender shaft. Another characteristic of the femur noted is that it projects well forward from the main body of the shaft. Although little is known of the hand of cynodonts, it is believed that Cricodon metabolus has a phalangeal formula of 23443, with the second phalange reduced in digits three and four.

She was also the first woman to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Born in 1926, Hernandez attended Howard University, where her interest in civil rights was cemented in an incident where she was told that she had to hail a \\"black\\" taxi. After graduating with honors, she became a labor union organizer before helping found NOW. As its second president, she helped organize the Women's Strike for Equality and testified in front of a congressional subcommittee on the Equal Rights Amendment, but she left the organization out of frustration with what she saw as its racial inequities. Hernandez would go on to co-found several organizations that focused on African-American women, along with teaching at several universities in California. She died in 2017 at the age of 90. Early life and education Hernandez was born Aileen Blanche Clarke on May 23, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jamaican immigrants Charles Henry Clarke Sr., an art supply executive, and Ethel Louise Hall, a seamstress. As the only African- American family on their block in Bay Ridge, they were subjected to racial discrimination from their neighbors, something she would later point to as a reason for her interest in political activism. Hernandez was educated at the all-girls Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn and later received a scholarship to attend Howard University. At Howard, she received a degree in sociology and political science, graduating magna cum laude, and was a member of the college's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Her interest in civil rights had been sustained by an experience she had in Washington, D.C., fresh off the train from New York to start at Howard. When she asked a station attendant for a way to the university, she was told to hail a \\"black\\" taxi cab. Unaware of prevailing social conventions in the city, she assumed that this referred to the color of the car. However, \\"this wasn't the issue,\\" she later said in an interview with Makers. \\"If you wanted to go to Howard University,\\" a traditionally African- American university, \\"no taxi driver who was white was going to take you.\\" After graduation she went to Norway and, through the International Student Exchange program, did graduate work in comparative government at the University of Oslo. When she returned to the United States, Hernandez began graduate studies at New York University, but left for California in 1951 upon learning that the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union had an open place in their labor college, which aimed to train new labor leaders. Activism Active as an organizer with the Garment Workers' Union, Hernandez eventually became the Education and Public Relations Director for the union's Pacific coast region. In 1960, she visited six South American countries under the auspices of the US State Department, where she gave lectures on the United States. A year later, Hernandez finished a master's degree in government from the California State University at Los Angeles, shortly before she officially left the Garment Workers' Union to work on the comptroller campaign of Alan Cranston. With his victory, she was appointed as the Deputy Chief of the California Division of Fair Employment Practices. As a result of her work in this position, she was appointed by Lyndon Johnson in 1964 as the only woman on the newly established Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. However, she resigned in 1966 after just eighteen months, having been frustrated at the commission's lack of speed in addressing cases that involved sexual discrimination. Hernandez helped found and was the National Organization for Women's (NOW) second national president from 1970 to 1971, during which time it organized the Women's Strike for Equality. One of her goals in this position was to reshape what she called the NOW's \\"embarrassingly elitist and middle-class\\" image, stating that \\"I'm much more interested in the problems of the mass woman than the professional ... The low-income woman isn't going to run to join NOW, but she's going to relate to our program because she has known for a long time the problems of combining a family with a job.\\" In spring 1970, she testified in front of a congressional subcommittee on the Equal Rights Amendment. After resigning the presidency, she co-founded NOW's Minority Women's Task Force but became frustrated with what she saw as the organization's unwillingness to take on racial inequity, especially within NOW itself. She eventually left NOW in 1979 after white candidates were elected to every officer position for the second straight year. Other accomplishments of Hernandez's included co-founding the National Women's Political Caucus, Black Women Stirring the Waters, Black Women Organized for Political Action, and a publishing company with nine African-American women. She served as the co- chair of the National Urban Coalition and on the boards of or advisory committees of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the NAACP, and several other organizations, in addition to teaching within the University of California system and the University of San Francisco and founding an eponymous consulting firm.  Personal life  While working as an organizer for the ILGWU in 1957, Aileen Hernandez married Alfonso Hernandez, a garment cutter. Their marriage ended in 1961, the same year that she received her master's degree, summa cum laude, in government. Death Hernandez died on February 13, 2017, at the age of 90 from complications related to dementia. The ACLU's deputy director Dorothy Ehrlich, who had known Hernandez from the 1970s, noted that \\"Aileen Hernandez‚Äôs entire life embodied the movement forward for women and people of color, and her significant role in that history will never be forgotten.\\" NOW's president Terry O'Neill wrote: \\"NOW's commitment to intersectional feminism is a direct legacy of Aileen Hernandez's unshakable belief in diversity and racial justice.\\" Honors *In 1989, the Northern California chapter of the ACLU gave Hernandez its civil liberties award for \\"decades of work for equality and justice.\\" *In 2005, Hernandez was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize along with some 1,000 women from 150 nations, so honored for their work in social justice and civil rights.

Democrat Stephanie Hansen, an environmental lawyer from Middletown who had in the past served a term as New Castle County Council President, won with 58.1% of the vote, defeating Republican opponent John Marino, who finished with 40.8%. Libertarian John Lanzendorfer, the only other candidate in the race, claimed the other 1.1%. Republicans had hoped that their party could capitalize on gains they had made in the 2016 elections in a potentially vulnerable district, where despite a Democratic edge in voter registration Marino had lost to Hall-Long by less than 300 votes in the 2014 election. Hansen's victory ensured that Democrats retained control of the state senate, where they have been the majority party since 1976. Since Delaware's House of Representatives has been controlled by Democrats for the preceding eight years, and no Republican has served as governor since 1993, Democrats also preserved their trifecta. Delaware was at that time one of only five U.S. states where the Democratic party controls the executive and legislative branches of government. The race attracted significant national media attention and interest from Democrats outside of Delaware, who along with several liberal political action committees and labor unions contributed more money to Hansen's campaign than both Marino and Hall-Long had spent combined in their 2014 contest, conscious of their party's frequently poor performance in special elections; ultimately, she raised over a million dollars, ten times as much as a Delaware state legislative race usually costs and a new record for any state legislative race and any special election in Delaware. Marino also raised a large amount of money for a state legislative race, but was still outspent. There were also formal complaints from both sides over apparent collusion between the campaigns and outside groups. Republicans were also unhappy after the election when it was reported that some voters had been under the age of 18 due to a loophole in a recently passed election law. Democrats both inside and outside the state saw the contest as a chance to respond electorally to the presidency of Donald Trump, which had led to widespread protests since his inauguration the month before, and while Hansen and Marino primarily campaigned on local issues, she touched on national concerns in her advertising and speeches. Former Delaware U.S. Senator Joseph Biden, whose term as Vice President had ended at the same time Trump was sworn in, not only appeared at Hansen's fundraisers and in her campaign ads but went door-to-door with her as well. Hansen's victory margin and the 35.3% voter turnout, better than usual for a special election, were seen as validating hopes that opposition to Trump could motivate Democrats to vote and possibly lead to greater success later that year and in the 2018 national midterm elections. Background After Democratic dominance of the state in the late 19th century, neither party truly dominated Delaware politics for most of the 20th. That began to change in 1974, when Democrats gained control of the state senate and have held it ever since. The state's electoral votes for President have gone to Democrats ever since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and no Republican has served as governor since Dale E. Wolf's brief tenure at the beginning of the following year. William V. Roth's defeat in 2000 made him the last of his party to serve as one of the state's U.S. Senators. In 2008, with Delawarean Joseph Biden on the national ballot as the Democratic nominee for Vice President, the state House swung to his party, and by 2010 Democrats had gained Delaware's sole seat in the U.S. House as well. Only Tom Wagner remained as the state auditor. Starting with that year's elections, however, Republicans began regaining one state senate seat each election. By 2016 they had narrowed the Democratic advantage in the 21-member body to just two seats. That year's election created the possibility that the GOP could reclaim control when Patricia Blevins, the senate's president pro tempore, was narrowly upset by Anthony Delcollo in her suburban Wilmington district, and Bethany Hall-Long was elected lieutenant governor. She vacated her state senate seat to assume the position early in January 2017, requiring a special election to fill her seat in the 10th district. =The 10th Senate district= The state senate's 10th district is located in the western and southwestern areas of New Castle County, northernmost, most populous and politically the most Democratic of Delaware's three counties. It is a narrow strip, running north to south close to the state's western border with Maryland from just south of the University of Delaware campus in Newark, north of Interstate 95, through Glasgow, just west of Lums Pond State Park to Middletown and reaching east to the northwest vicinity of Odessa along Delaware Route 1, both of the latter south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which traditionally divides the state into northern and southern portions, the latter of which is more Republican-leaning. It is within commuting distance of Wilmington, Baltimore and Philadelphia by car and rail. Most of the district is either exurban residential subdivisions or worked fields, broken by occasional woodlots. The 10th is a nominally Democratic district, with 45% of its registered voters affiliating with the party while only 28% are Republicans. However, that has in recent years not always translated into comfortable wins for Democratic candidates. In the 2014 elections, in the middle of a presidential term when Democrats are less likely to vote, Bethany Hall-Long, who had generally won easily since her initial election in 2008, had her closest victory, with less than 300 votes, under 2% of the total, separating her and Republican John Marino, a retired New York City police officer and realtor who had made the district his home. In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton had carried the district with 54% of the vote, less than a percentage point above her victory margin statewide. Blevins, defeated the previous November, represented a district with more than twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans. Candidates Before the date of the special election had been set, both parties had settled on candidates. In early December the state Republican Party announced it would nominate Marino for a second try at the seat. Before his narrow 2014 loss, he had also run a close race in 2010 for a state House seat held at the time by Rebecca Walker. He made his top campaign issue the purportedly stifling effect of one-party rule on Delaware and its citizens. One New Castle Democrat interviewed by the Wilmington News Journal, the state's largest newspaper, agreed, pointing out how Blevins had been appointed to lead the state's animal-welfare agency after her loss in the November election, despite possibly insufficient qualification for the job. Democrats from the district committees in the 10th district met to hear from six potential candidates. Earl Jaques Jr., a state representative from a district in the Glasgow area whose winning electoral record had made him an early favorite for the nomination, had taken himself out of the running early on, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. After the group of 25 chose Hansen, New Castle County party chair Betsy Maron formally announced her as the nominee. Both candidates waited for the election date to be set to formally file their candidacies with the state's Department of Elections. At the beginning of 2017, a third candidate, credit card fraud investigator Joseph Lanzendorfer, was also announced on the Libertarian line. Campaign On January 17, 10 days after the state legislative session began, Hall-Long was sworn in as lieutenant governor and resigned her seat the same day. She retained her role in the senate, however, since as with many lieutenant governors and the U.S. Vice President she is also the body's president. While it is a mostly ceremonial post, with the president pro tempore exercising the practical powers and authority of the job, one of those responsibilities that falls to the lieutenant governor is setting the date for special elections to vacated seats. A week after taking her new office, Hall-Long finally announced that the special election for her former seat would be held a month and a day later, on February 25. Marino made an issue of the length of time it took to set the date, connecting it to one of his general campaign platforms that Delaware and its residents had suffered from eight unbroken years of Democratic control and it was time for voters to put an end to it. \\"Democrats have known for months what the date is going to be,\\" he charged. \\"It is another example of the Dover insiders taking advantage of their power. They get the inside information.\\" Hansen made no response of her own other than to say she was happy she could finally give voters she had been talking to when visiting their houses a date. She did, however, criticize the senate minority for blocking new Governor John Carney's appointment of former federal Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator Shawn Garvin to head the state's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, whose previous role in the Obama Administration they had objected to. Hansen likened it to the obstructionist politics of their fellow Republicans in Congress. While the election was for state office, both candidates appealed to the national political mood. Upon being announced as the Republican nominee, Marino told radio station WDDE that the presidential election a month earlier had revealed \\"a sense of frustration and disappointment, and a lack of trust with our elected officials and our leadership\\". His campaign slogan, \\"Make Delaware First Again\\", echoed Trump's \\"Make America Great Again\\", although he denied any intent to evoke the new president, calling on voters to stay focused on Delaware. \\"Casting a vote out of frustration of what's going on at the federal level is not the right direction to go,\\" he told National Public Radio. Some Republican voters, tired of protests against Trump and his Cabinet picks, agreed with him. Hansen, speaking at a local Women's March the day after Donald Trump's inauguration, said \\"[h]ate speech, divisiveness, exclusivity, misogyny will not rule the day because we won't let it.\\" Later she told The New York Times that many of her encounters with Democratic voters began with \\"venting sessions\\" where they expressed their anger about the actions of Trump and the Republicans in Washington. \\"I will come up to houses and ... people are glued to their TV sets because you never know what craziness is going to pop up during the day.\\" =Debate= The national issues shared the stage with local ones when the candidates debated on February 1. Supporters of both Hansen and Marino dominated the audience at the event, sponsored by news radio station WDEL-FM, whose Alan Loudell served as moderator, at Middletown High School, cheering and booing responses. The two major party candidates differentiated themselves on abortion, with Marino opposing it as \\"ripping a child out of a mother's womb\\" while Hansen and Lanzendorfer both said it was a decision that should be left to a woman and her physician. Marino called for Delaware to adopt a right-to-work law to improve its job creation, saying it need not be seen as anti-union, while Hansen opposed it as \\"the right to work for less.\\" Marino confronted Hansen at one point about her allegedly changing her position on whether parents should be allowed to opt their children out of standardized testing. In return she said that his active opposition to a successful December 2016 referendum on a capital improvement project for the Appoquinimink School District made him seem hypocritical when he claimed to support public education. Lanzendorfer said he disagreed with most other Libertarians on abolishing public education entirely, calling it an \\"extremist\\"' position. He called for schools to be funded out of taxes levied on legalized marijuana. National issues entered the debate when the candidates were asked about Trump's executive order tightening immigration restrictions on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, issued four days earlier and dominating the news at the time. Hansen and Lanzendorfer both condemned it, while Marino said the country should focus on its own citizens. This sparked some debate within the audience as to whether he had answered the question, and the extent to which the race was about Trump. \\"If we want to be able to keep the federal Republican agenda from settling in our living room, we have to be able to have our own fortification here at home\\", Hansen reiterated as to why voters should retain the Democratic majority in the Senate. Hansen and Marino agreed on some issues. Neither said the state needed to raise taxes despite a $350 million deficit, and they opposed efforts to repeal Delaware's Coastal Zone Act, which limits industrial activities in that area of the state, although there were some areas where it could be relaxed to allow the redevelopment of former industrial sites. Marino also agreed with the others that it was not necessary to restore the state's death penalty, struck down as unconstitutional by the Delaware Supreme Court in August 2016, distinguishing himself from five of the state senate's Republicans, all of them former police officers as well, who have consistently supported it. =Endorsements= Two days before the election, Marino was endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Delaware Political Action Committee, based on his answers to their candidate survey. Pointing also to his own experience starting and running a small business, the NFIB said \\"Our members could certainly use more lawmakers that think along the same lines as Mr. Marino.\\" According to her campaign website, Hansen likewise earned the endorsements of several labor groups, including the Delaware State AFL-CIO, the state building trades organization, the District Council of Delaware Laborers, and the Delaware State Education Association, which represents the state's teachers. Mary Ann's List, an organization similar to the national Emily's List that works to raise funds for pro-choice Democratic women running for office in Delaware, also endorsed Hansen's candidacy, along with organizations speaking for the state's Chinese American and LGBT communities. No notable Republicans campaigned on Marino's behalf; state party chairman Charles Copeland said late in the campaign there had not been any outreach to them. For Hansen, however, Governor Carney made appearances, as did the state's two U.S. senators, Tom Carper (also formerly governor and the state's congressman) and Chris Coons (who had succeeded Hansen as New Castle County Council president in 2001). Martin O'Malley, who had sought the Democratic presidential nomination the preceding year, came over the state line from Maryland, where he had served as governor for two terms, to campaign for Hansen. He said the great interest Democrats nationally were showing in the race was a sign that they were \\"waking up to the reality that we've got to rebuild our party\\" at the state level, having grown complacent about those elections during the years when Barack Obama was President. =Fundraising= Shortly before the election, the News Journal reported on the required financial disclosures by the candidates' campaigns. Between January 27 and February 17, when the forms had to be filed, Hansen's campaign reported raising over $300,000 from Democrats not just in Delaware but around the country, from all 50 states, around 14,000 of those donations amounting to less than $100 each, of which she had spent just under half. A political action committee (PAC), First State Strong, that also entered the race on her behalf, had spent almost $400,000; it is, however, not required to disclose its donors until January 2018. The newspaper speculated that Hansen and First State Strong were on pace to spend $1 million on the race, more than had ever been spent in any race for a seat in either house of the state legislature. Usually, it reported, candidates spend around $50,000 in their races, perhaps twice that if the election is vigorously contested. The money raised for Hansen allowed her campaign to afford commercials on Philadelphia TV stations, an expense normally beyond the budgets of state legislative campaigns even in the state's general elections. National fundraising was directed to Hansen in part by two Democratically affiliated websites, Flippable.org and Sister District, which connect voters living in electorally safe districts to more marginal races where their dollars and volunteer efforts can potentially make a difference. Flippable, founded by a former Hillary Clinton campaign worker, alone raised $130,000 of Hansen's campaign contributions. Hansen said after the elections she was \\"shocked\\" by the support she got, attributing it to Democrats' desire to take a stand against the Trump presidency. \\"I think this movement had started and was looking for a vehicle, and we were that vehicle.\\" The cash flowing to her campaign also meant that Hansen, unlike most candidates, did not have to devote any of her time to making fundraising calls herself to potential large donors. Instead, she could devote all her campaigning time to voter contact. \\"She was out knocking on doors from 11 a.m. until dark,\\" said her campaign manager, Erik Raser-Schramm. Marino, by contrast, had spent a little over $65,000 during the same period. FirstStateFirst, a PAC supporting him, reported spending only $35,000. He called the amount of money coming into Hansen's campaign from all over the country \\"pretty gross\\", preferring to campaign by going door-to-door in person. \\"My hope is that the voters will see how much I care about this district and the issues that are facing it.\\" Allegations of election law violations by PACs The involvement of the PACs drew formal complaints to the state's Elections Department from both sides. Two weeks before the election, Delaware Republican chairman Charles Copeland alleged in his filing that First State Strong and the Delaware Building and Construction Trades Union Council had coordinated its activities with Hansen's campaign in violation of election law. The PAC, he claimed, had sent out mailers that attacked Marino, while a plumbers' union local that belonged to the building-trades council had distributed door hangers supporting Hansen and urging a vote for her during a weekend canvassing event. Copeland said these actions constituted express advocacy, forbidden to outside groups that coordinate their actions with candidates' campaigns. Copeland also sharply criticized First State Strong for not voluntarily disclosing its donors, something it is not required to do until January 2018, which he said could instantly resolve the issue. He noted that a single one of the PAC's donations accounted for almost half the total money it had reported raising. \\"I can guarantee that [their ads are] being coordinated with the Hansen campaign,\\" Copeland said. \\"And the Election Commissioner is duty bound to investigate this shadowy PAC and find the truth.\\" Raser-Schramm called the claims \\"absurd\\", noting that it was hypocritical of Copeland to make the allegations when he himself had raised money for many PACs promoting conservative causes while continuing to serve as state party chairman. First State Strong likewise called the allegations \\"frivolous\\". As to the door hangers, Building and Construction Trades Council president Jim Maravelias called Copeland's complaint \\"alternative facts\\", noting that election law permits unions to engage in express advocacy when communicating with their own members. He in turn accused Copeland and Republicans of trying \\"to divert voters' attention from their party's weak candidate.\\" After a preliminary investigation, state Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove ruled that no express advocacy occurred in First State Strong's mailer, so there was no issue. The door hangers, on other hand, did engage in express advocacy, but a visit by Hansen to a meeting of a different branch of the building-trades council did not suffice to establish there had been coordination between the union group and her campaign. Copeland called the ruling \\"a sad day for Delaware\\" and said the party would appeal it in court. On Hansen's side, Maravelias, also Delaware's AFL-CIO president, made a similar allegation against FirstStateFirst, arguing that since sitting Republican state senator Gregory Lavelle served as treasurer for both the PAC and Marino's campaign, using his home address to solicit donations for both. Manlove denied that complaint shortly before the election, saying that coincidence did not necessarily prove illegal collusion between the two. =Advertising= Hansen's well-funded campaign dominated the airwaves, with some of her ads using footage from anti-Trump protests. Both candidates tried to reach voters through their mailboxes. Both candidates took exception to some of the claims made about their past records in attack ads sent as mailers. Hansen called a claim by Marino's campaign that she sought to increase the state's gas tax, based on something she had said in April 2015, \\"disingenuous\\", adding that it was not the time to do so in any event. She also dismissed a further claim that she would eliminate a property tax deduction for seniors as a scare tactic. Marino likewise disputed some of the attacks on him. He particularly objected to a FirstStateStrong ad pointing out that he had lost two elections already, suggesting that this was because voters rejected his policies. In response, Marino noted that both of those losses had been close. He also rejected claims that he supported cuts to public education funding. \\"I have said from the start that a strong education system is one of the most important things we need to have.\\" =Canvassing= In addition to the many donations, the national attention brought the Hansen campaign volunteers as well. Many showed up from all over Delaware to canvass, and the campaign told the News Journal it believed it had knocked on the door of every voter likely to support the candidate \\"at least once.\\" Phone banks to reach those voters who were not able to answer their doors when canvassers knocked were organized by supporters as far away as San Francisco. A thousand volunteers came into the district from Delaware and nearby states, half of them on the day of the election. For many, it was their first experience with a political campaign. With this many, the campaign had trouble finding enough voters for all of them to talk to; David Sokola, a Democratic state senator, told the Huffington Post that was more volunteers than he'd had in all nine of his election campaigns combined. By the time of the election staffers estimated that they had knocked on 90,000 doors and made 60,000 calls to voters. Hansen, who was able to do a lot of canvassing herself since she did not need to worry about raising money herself, got one very high-profile volunteer the weekend before the election. A rumor that sitting Vice President Mike Pence would appear on Marino's behalf led Hansen's campaign to ask Joseph Biden, his Democratic predecessor, a six- term Delaware U.S. Senator who had also served on New Castle County Council, if he would appear for her. After he spoke at a fundraiser for her, he offered to do more. He appeared in radio and television ads for Hansen, telling voters the race was about \\"being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be O.K.'\\" He even said he was willing to go door-to-door with her talking to voters. \\"Are you serious?\\" Hansen recalled asking him, in a The New York Times story about the race. He was, and the two spent the last Saturday before the election visiting voters in the Newark area. While many of them were delighted to meet him, taking selfies with the former vice president and even in some cases imploring him to run for President in 2020, he reminded them that he was appearing for Hansen, and they should remember to vote for her. Copeland suggested to the Times that Biden's presence in the race along with other high-profile Democrats showed how weak their standing with voters in the state truly was. Election The weather on February 25‚Äîunseasonably warm and clear‚Äîwas seen as ideal for high voter turnout. A thunderstorm line that passed across the state around 4:30 p.m. only briefly deterred voters from going to the polls. By the time they closed at 8 p.m. 35.3% of all registered voters had cast ballots, well above the 10% who turn out for Delaware special elections on average. It was also more voters, and a greater percentage that had turned out for the 2014 election that Marino had almost won. When all the votes were counted, Hansen was the clear winner, with 7,110 of the 12,376 votes cast, or 58.1%. Marino's total of 5,127 accounted for 40.8%. Lanzendorfer finished a distant third with 139 votes, 1.1% of the total. Democrats pointed to more numerical indicators of successful campaigning than just the high turnout. Hansen had outperformed Hall-Long's 2014 total by more than a thousand votes. Her share of the vote, as well, was four percentage points better than that Hillary Clinton had gotten from the district's voters in November's presidential election. The News Journal calculated that Hansen's campaign had spent $102.40 for every vote Hansen had gotten, based purely on the amounts the campaign and First State Strong had reported by the election. There were two issues on the day of the election. Some voters reported receiving calls that morning saying Hansen had withdrawn from the race. After they were reported to the Department of Elections, they were turned over to the state's Department of Justice for further investigation. On the other side, Republicans were upset when they learned that some of the voters casting ballots were under the age of 18. State senator Gregory Lavelle, who served as Marino's campaign manager, said this was \\"outrageous\\" and filed a complaint of his own when he heard of it by noon that day. However, New Castle County's Election Department explained that state law allows those as young as 16 to register when they receive their driver's licenses, as long as they will be 18 by the next general election. This was in accordance with a 2010 law intended to make it easier for teenagers to vote upon turning 18. \\"That was not the intent\\", Lavelle claimed, adding that it seemed to him that the Elections Department decisions seemed to be favoring Hansen, and that the department should have let the legislature know this could happen. He did not know at the time he raised the issue how many under-18 voters had voted, saying he would \\"wait and see\\". Marino's lopsided loss turned out to make the issue moot. After accepting a congratulatory phone call from Biden, Hansen spoke to her supporters at the Odessa fire hall. She again connected the race to national politics. \\"It was the first chance for voters to declare with one loud voice that we're better than the politics of fear and division\\", she said. \\"I think tonight they're hearing us loud and clear in all corners of this country‚Äîand certainly in D.C. and in Dover.\\" Marino did not make a statement or appear publicly. But other Republicans spoke for him and their party. While commending Marino and his campaign for their work, Lavelle admitted \\"we knew it would not be easy.\\" He conceded that for Democrats, \\"it absolutely was a national race\\". Copeland, the state Republican chair, continued to accuse Democrats of buying the election. \\"[They] spent over $100 per vote in a district that they already had a 60-to-40 registration advantage,\\" he said. \\"Once again, we are seeing what happens when one political party has absolute power ... corruption.\\" Once she is sworn in, Hansen will complete Hall-Long's term, which expires shortly after the 2018 general election. She has not said yet whether she will run for re-election then; should she do so, and win, she would serve a two-year term ending in 2020, with the term after that extending to 2022. Aftermath Democrats and their supporters nationally were delighted by the outcome. \\"On Saturday ... the voices in the streets turned into votes in the ballot box,\\" the Huffington Post wrote, alluding to the protests against the Trump administration that had dominated the national news during the campaign. Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who had just the same day been elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee, tweeted: \\"Great work. We kept the majority in Delaware. Let's keep the momentum going, this is only the beginning.\\" Publicly, Delaware Republicans stuck with their line that Democrats had bought the election for Hansen. Two weeks after the election, Marino characterized the amount of money she raised, particularly from out of state, as \\"obnoxious, frankly.\\" He said Delawareans \\"should be represented for their best interests, not the interests of lobbyists or people outside the state.\\" Hansen responded that although many of the voters whose homes she visited started the conversation with national issues, \\"as soon as they got that off the chest, they wanted to talk about education or about the traffic or on job creation\\", all common issues in legislative races in any state. To make sure the campaign stayed local, staff allowed only volunteers who were themselves from Delaware to make calls at its phonebanking events. However, Republican sources \\"on the ground\\", not named or directly quoted, who talked to Roll Call after the election offered more praise for Democratic efforts. Hansen's party, they said, took fuller advantage of changes in state campaign finance laws on coordination between outside groups and campaigns. They also credited the Democrats with exploiting the loophole that allowed some voters not yet 18 to cast ballots. For Roll Call and the national media generally, the question was what this meant for Democrats going forward, particularly in the 2018 midterms, when the party might be able to retake control of Congress. While Democratic spirits, commentator Nathan Gonzales noted, were certainly buoyed by the win, \\"the realities surrounding the race are more sobering\\". The party expected a competitive race given the higher stakes than usual in most special elections for state legislative seats, and thus \\"flooded the zone\\" to win. However, at the same time, \\"Republicans didn't put up much of a fight.\\" Gonzales speculated that this may have been because Delaware has only one at- large U.S. House seat and thus national Republicans saw no possible advantage to be gained by control of the state's senate in redistricting following the 2020 census. He also suggested that Democrats overstated Republican strength in the 10th district, since Marino's close finish in 2014 may have had more to do with Hall-Long's husband getting arrested and charged stealing some of Marino's signs a week before the election (a qualifier also noted by David Weigel in The Washington Post) than any GOP gains in what may well have been their best possible election year in recent memory. \\"The good news for Democrats is that demonizing President Donald Trump galvanized and mobilized Democratic voters\\", Gonzales wrote. However, Democrats would have to make that strategy work in tougher terrain than a Democratic-leaning state senate district in Delaware if they wanted to regain the 24 seats needed for a House majority in 2018. For example, if the party spent $137 per vote, roughly as much as it did on Hansen in a successful effort to win the nearby 7th district of Pennsylvania, a swing district currently represented by Republican Pat Meehan but which has voted for Democratic presidential candidates and representatives in the past, it would cost $16 million. Much depends on whether the Democrats can maintain a consistent level of engagement among its base over the next 20 months, as the Tea Party did for Republicans during the early years of the Obama administration. \\"[T]he biggest lesson out of this Delaware race,\\" Gonzales concluded, \\"appears to be that when Democrats dramatically outspend Republicans in Democratic districts, Democrats win.\\" See also *Georgia's 6th congressional district special election, 2017, also seen by Democrats as an early referendum on Trump's presidency *Politics of Delaware *United States elections, 2017 Notes References Delaware special elections 2017 * February 2017 events in the United States United States Senate ","title":"2017 Delaware's 10th state senate district special election"},{"id":"53355754","text":"Jolaibari railway station is a proposed railway station in South Tripura district, Tripura.

It was designed by sculptor Gertrude K. Lathrop, who lived in Albany, New York's state capital. In 1936, Congress approved many commemorative coins for issuance, including some of mostly local significance. These included the Albany piece, wanted by city officials to mark the 250th anniversary of the 1686 grant of its municipal charter by Thomas Dongan, governor of colonial New York. The authorizing bill passed through Congress without opposition, though amendments added protections for coin collectors against abuses seen in earlier commemorative issues. Lathrop's designs have generally been praised: she placed a beaver on one side of the coin, modeled from life (one appears on Albany's city seal) and depicted the persons involved in the grant of the charter on the other. After approval of the designs by the Commission of Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Mint coined 25,013 Albany half dollars in October 1936, including 13 pieces for testing by the Assay Commission. By the time of issuance, the demand for commemorative coins was falling, and the issue price of $2 was considered high. More than 7,000 were returned to the Mint in 1943, and a hoard of over 2,000 was sold by a local bank in 1954 at the original issue price. The Albany half dollar prices in the low hundreds of dollars, but the original packaging, if undamaged, may sell for more.  Background  The first European to visit the site of Albany, New York was the Englishman Henry Hudson in 1609. In 1624, the Dutch established Fort Orange there as a permanent settlement. The English took control of the area in 1664, but there remained Dutch property claims. In 1685, Fort Orange's name was changed to Albany, after James, Duke of Albany, the future James II. The following year, Pieter Schuyler and Robert Livingston went to New York City, the colonial capital of New York, to obtain a municipal charter for Albany from Governor Thomas Dongan. Schuyler became the first mayor of Albany; Livingston was made the clerk of the city and county of Albany and thus entitled to fees. The city became the capital of New York State in 1797. Until 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, which then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then entered the secondary market; in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance, such as the Albany half dollar. The group designated to purchase the Albany half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Albany's mayor. Legislation Portrait of Pieter Schuyler painted by Nehemiah Partridge between 1710 and 1718 Legislation for a commemorative half dollar in honor of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Albany was introduced into the House of Representatives on April 23, 1935 by Parker Corning of New York. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. On February 17, 1936 it was reported back to the House, with a recommendation that it pass after being amended. The amendment increased the authorized mintage from 10,000 half dollars to 25,000, and required that a committee of at least three people appointed by Albany's mayor be empowered to order the coins from the Mint (the original bill permitted an individual to have that power). Congressman Corning brought the bill to the House floor on March 25, and it passed without debate or opposition. In the Senate, the bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency on March 26, 1936. Only two weeks earlier, on March 11, a subcommittee of the Banking Committee led by Colorado's Alva B. Adams had examined abuses of commemorative coin issuers. The subcommittee had heard of the commemorative coin abuses of the time, when issuers often increased the number of coins needed for a complete set by having them issued at different mints with different mint marks; existing legislation placed no prohibition on this. Lyman W. Hoffecker, a Texas coin dealer and official of the American Numismatic Association, testified that some coins like the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926, had been issued over the course of years with different dates and mint marks. Other issues had been entirely bought up by single dealers, and some low- mintage varieties of commemorative coins were selling at high prices. The many varieties and inflated prices for some issues that resulted from these practices angered coin collectors trying to keep their collections current. Adams reported the Albany bill back to the Senate on May 21, 1936, with a proposed amendment. The amendment entirely rewrote the bill, imposing restrictions such as a one-year limit for issuance of the coins from the Mint after enactment of the bill, and that they be struck at only one of the mints. The bill was considered by the Senate on June 1, and the bill was amended and passed without discussion or dissent. As the two houses had not passed identical versions, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on June 3, James M. Mead of New York moved that the House accept the Senate amendment; it did so without recorded discussion or dissent. The bill became law on June 16, 1936 with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, authorizing the minting of 25,000 half dollars. The law authorized the Albany committee to sell the half dollars at face value or at a premium, and required that the proceeds go to defray the cost of the anniversary celebrations.  Preparation  On July 2, 1936, Albany's mayor, John B. Thacher, wrote to Director of the Mint Nellie Tayloe Ross advising her that he had appointed the legislatively mandated three-member committee (the Albany Dongan Charter Coin Committee), led by William L. Gillespie, the president of the National Commercial Bank and Trust Company. He stated that the city had commissioned Gertrude K. Lathrop, sculptor, to design the coin. Thacher indicated that Lathrop had come highly recommended by Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser and others. He noted that Albany's anniversary celebrations would take place July 19 to 22 and wanted the new coins as soon thereafter as possible. On September 2, Lathrop went to the offices of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), bringing the completed plaster models for the coin and a letter from its sculptor-member, Lee Lawrie, with her. The CFA was, by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding, charged with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Lawrie favored the designs in his letter, but was concerned that the letters in the word were too small, and would be lost when the models were reduced. Lathrop went to see Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock at the Philadelphia Mint, who said the word would still be visible, and stated that he thought the models would yield a \\"splendid coin\\". She also gained the support of Assistant Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly. Lawrie reconsidered, and the models were approved by the CFA on September 9, 1936; the dies were completed later that month or in October.  Design  The seal of Albany The obverse of the half dollar depicts a beaver. Many of Albany's early settlers earned a living through the trade in beaver pelts, and the animal appears on the city's seal. Lathrop modeled the coin from a live beaver; one was lent to her for a few days at her studio by the New York State Department of Conservation. \\"[I]t is occasional contact with the interesting and friendly citizens of the wild that adds spice to one's work,\\" Lathrop wrote. The beaver in Lathrop's design gnaws on a branch of maple, the New York state tree. Two maple keys, containing the seeds, are used to divide the name of the issuing country from the coin's denomination: they, as well as the pine cones that fulfill a similar function on the reverse, were meant by the sculptor to symbolize the growth and fertility of the community. The lumber industry was for many years a mainstay of Albany's economy. is to the beaver's left; to its right. The reverse depicts Schuyler and Livingston taking leave of Governor Dongan. Schuyler, soon to be mayor, holds his city's charter. Lathrop studied portraits of Schuyler and Livingston, though both paintings were made some 30 years after their trip from Albany to New York City. For Dongan, there is no known portrait, and Lathrop relied on the brief extant descriptions of the colonial governor. Lathrop was allowed access to the charter to measure and study it. She visited the Smithsonian and the Metropolitan Museum of Art while researching the men's clothing. A small pine tree is visible behind Governor Dongan; an eagle overspreads the group, with the small word above the bird. The designer's initials are in small letters beside Dongan's foot. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers wrote that the design \\"has always been considered pleasing by numismatists\\". David Bullowa, in his 1938 work on commemoratives, wrote, \\"every symbol and device on this issue has significance as connected with the early Colonial history of New York. The inscriptions have been reduced to a size that makes them almost unreadable. The word 'Liberty' on this coin, above the eagle, is microscopic.\\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on American coins and medals, deemed the Albany half dollar \\"an important contribution to American numismatics\\". He suggested that the beaver, a symbol of Albany, gnawing the maple branch, a symbol of New York State, \\"would then seem to become an allegory of municipal government feeding on the rule of the state!\\" Given the complexity of the reverse, he stated, \\"that the coin as a whole has considerable appeal can be counted as a credit to the good training and innate taste of the artist, who was able to work in all these allusions to local aspirations and a bygone event with modest, positive precision.\\"  Minting, distribution and collecting  Front cover of coin holder in which the half dollars were sent to purchasers A total of 25,013 Albany half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during October 1936, including 13 pieces set aside to be available for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were sold by the Albany Dongan Charter Coin Committee for $2 each. The price was considered high for the time (a more usual price for a new issue then would be $1 or $1.50). Additionally, the commemorative coin mania that had been sweeping the country in the spring and summer of 1936 had already seen close to twenty other commemorative coins issued that same year, and had abated by the time the Albany piece was available. Sales were thus unexpectedly low. The Albany Dongan Committee continued to sell the coins until 1943, refusing to lower the public price, though the entire remaining stock was offered to New York City coin dealer Abe Kosoff at face value plus $50. He declined, unwilling to buy them all himself and unable to find backers for a syndicate to purchase them. The committee wrote to O'Reilly in February 1937, wanting to know the procedure for returning unsold coins, and in 1943, with sales at a standstill, it returned 7,342 pieces for redemption and melting, leaving 17,658 specimens extant. The retail price from coin dealers of the Albany half dollar in uncirculated condition dropped as low as $1.50 in 1940, recovering to $4 in 1950. In 1954 it became known that the State Bank of Albany had some 2,000 Albany half dollars in its vaults and was willing to sell them for the original issue price of $2. They sold to several local collectors and dealers. At the time, the market price was $8. By 1970, the market price was $80 and by 1985, $400. As of 2009, the coin could fetch $330 for an uncirculated coin rated as MS-60, and $470 for an MS-65. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the piece for between $220 and $425, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold for $20,125 in 2004. The original packaging, which is rarer than the half dollar itself, included a four-page booklet containing an illustration of the coin, a history of Albany, and slots for one to five coins. Both the booklet and the envelope it came in are highly collectible. Even scarcer are boxes designed to hold single coins and inscribed with \\"The National Commercial Bank and Trust Company of Albany\\". Numismatic author Anthony Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, values the holder at between $75 and $125, increased with the original envelope to between $125 and $175. The boxes have sold for between $350 and $3,000, depending on condition.

The bill repeals a rule issued by the Social Security Administration that would have required Federal agencies to identify individuals who receive disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act or Supplemental Security Income and have been \\"determination by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1) Is a danger to himself or to others; or (2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.\\" in order to potentially prohibit such individuals from purchasing firearms or from having other purchase firearms on their behalf. The repeal was signed into law by President Donald Trump on February 28, 2017.  Background  On December 19, 2016, during the Presidential transition of Donald Trump, the Social Security Administration issued the Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (). The rule reads in part: The rule would require that the Social Security administration report to the Attorney General recipients found to be disabled in order for them to be added to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. To qualify for reporting, an individual would have had to meet two criteria: *determination by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: Is a danger to himself or to others *They have to be receiving full disability benefits and couldn't find work. *They require the assistance of a third party to manage their own benefits. It was estimated that around 9% of the disability awardee population would have met this criteria (75,000 individuals). Support and opposition The bill was supported by the ACLU, the National Association for Mental Health, The American Association of People with Disabilities, and the National Council on Disability, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, as well as other disability rights advocates. The initial regulation was supported by the Brady Campaign to Stop Gun Violence, Moms Demand Action Against Gun Violence, Democratic gun control advocates, and some mental health experts.  Passage  On February 2, 2017, the repeal was debated and passed in the House. The final vote was 235-180, and was tabulated mostly along party lines. 229 Republicans and 6 Democrats voted in favor, while 2 Republicans and 178 Democrats voted against.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll077.xml The United States Senate passed the repeal on February 15, 2017.

Diamond is located in the median of State Road 37. The Winston and Bone Valley Railroad began operations in 1892. It was founded by J.D. Griffin and William Mills Winn, who had operated a lumber mill just four miles northwest of Lakeland since 1884. They relocated the mill to a location four miles west of Lakeland in 1892. The location of this lumber mill became known as Winnston (named for Winn), which would later be shortened to Winston. Griffin and Winn built the Winston and Bone Valley Railroad to serve the lumber mill. There was also heavy demand for rail service in the area's flourishing phosphate industry, and the 16-mile line also ended up serving many of the areas phosphate mines. The line was later leased to the Plant System in 1900, which also operated the nearby South Florida Railroad and Florida Southern Railway. The line was then extended to connect with the Florida Southern in Fort Meade. The lease was inherited by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902 when they took over the Plant System. The Coast Line then bought out the line completely in 1909, designating it as their Bone Valley Branch.

It was also known as Shinmin Prefecture or Korean Anarchist Federation in Manchuria. The society was constructed upon principles of stateless communism, operating within the framework of a gift economy based upon mutual aid. History =Background= Japan had invaded Korea in 1894, under the pretext of protecting Korea from China, after the Joseon dynasty invited China to help them put down the Donghak Peasant Revolution. Korea was finally annexed into the Japanese Empire in 1910. During World War I, Zhang Zuolin (a former bandit and supporter of Yuan Shikai), established himself as a powerful warlord with influence over most of Manchuria. He was inclined to keep his Manchu army under his control and to keep Manchuria free of foreign influence. The March 1st Movement involved 1,500 demonstrations and 2 million protesters. The Japanese Empire responded with brutal repression: 7,500 were killed and 16,000 wounded. As a result, many Korean anarchists fled to Manchuria and other parts of China. Meanwhile, Zuolin was rising through the ranks of the Republic of China, eventually establishing himself as President of the Republic of China of the Beiyang government. However, Japan successfully assassinated Zuolin, leaving behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the rival KMT and CCP, but also presented an opportunity for the numerous Korean anarchists now organised in Manchuria. =Foundation of the Autonomous Zone= The Korean Anarchist Federation, founded in 1929, sunk deep roots among the 2 million Koreans in Manchuria. The KPAM formed as a result of close collaboration between the Korean Anarchist Federation in Manchuria (KAFM) and the Korean Anarcho-Communist Federation (KACF) The KPAM was part of the \\"autonomous village movement\\" where anarchists and others, instead of focusing on some distant revolution or nationalist development plan, focused on meeting the material needs of the people and each other. This was part of a coming together of nationalist and anarchist people as well as Korean peasants in partial response to hostilities from Imperial Japan and Chinese Nationalist forces. Though initially separate, the two main affinities came together in a form of organization called \\"no rule\\" where social organization was based on individual liberty and mutual aid. =Repression= On January 20, 1930, the anarchist general Kim Chwa-chin was assassinated by an Imperial agent while doing repair work on a rice mill. After the assassination of another anarchist leader, Kim Jong-jin the following year, the anarchist movement in Manchuria and Korea became subject to massive repression. Japan sent armies to attack KPAM from the south, while pro-Kuomintang forces attacked from the north. With the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, many Korean anarchists went underground and KPAM ceased to exist as a distinct political entity. The KAF-M and KACF continued to fight in China alongside the Chinese communists against Japanese Imperialism until 1945, but Anarchist Shinmin was no more.  Government  Decision-making within the KPAM territories was based on the anarchist ideals of participatory democracy with the society being dominated by village assemblies and various council systems to create a grassroots society.  Economy  The KPAM drew heavily from the economic theories of libertarian socialism and established give-away shops, worker cooperatives and democratic schools throughout their territories. Regional councils were also created. In the meanwhile, they appointed higher-level staff (who only received minimum wage) from the top down, with lower levels of officials regionally chosen. Organisation and propaganda teams worked with agitating the populace, both to get the farmer's support and to get them to create independent village assemblies and committees. Seemingly, these teams were welcome to almost everywhere they went, with no major incidents being noted. The KPAM operated without currency, private property, and any kind of class structure. Thus, the territory functioned as an example for anarcho-communist groups throughout Manchuria.  Military  The army was composed mainly of experienced military officers, former soldiers and peasant guerillas who were trained at local guerilla schools.

In general, the higher ranked on the search results page and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers.Ortiz-Cordova, A. and Jansen, B. J. (2012) Classifying Web Search Queries in Order to Identify High Revenue Generating Customers. Journal of the American Society for Information Sciences and Technology. 63(7), 1426 ‚Äì 1441. Local SEO, however, differs in that it is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when users enter local searches for its products or services. Ranking for local search involves a similar process to general SEO but includes some specific elements to rank a business for local search. For example, local SEO is all about ‚Äòoptimizing‚Äò your online presence to attract more business from relevant local searches. The majority of these searches take place on Google, Yahoo, Bing and other search engines but for better optimization in your local area you should also use sites like Yelp, Angie's List, LinkedIn, Local business directories, social media channels and others.  The birth of local SEO  The origin of local SEO can be traced back to 2003-2005 when search engines tried to provide people with results in their vicinity as well as additional information such as opening times of a store, listings in maps, etc. Local SEO has evolved over the years to provide a targeted online marketing approach that allows local businesses to appear based on a range of local search signals, providing a distinct difference from broader organic SEO which prioritises relevance of search over a distance of searcher.  Local search results  Local searches trigger search engines to display two types of results on the Search engine results page: local organic results and the 'Local Pack'. The local organic results include web pages related to the search query with local relevance. These often include directories such as Yelp, Yellow Pages, Facebook, etc. The Local Pack displays businesses that have signed up with Google and taken ownership of their 'Google My Business' (GMB) listing. The information displayed in the GMB listing and hence in the Local Pack can come from different sources: * The owner of the business. This information can include opening/closing times, description of products or services, etc. * Information is taken from the business' website * User- provided information such as reviews or uploaded photos * Information from other sources such as social profiles etc. * Structured Data taken from Wikidata and Wikipedia. Data from these sources is part of the information that appears in Google's Knowledge Panel in the search results. Depending on the searches, Google can show relevant local results in Google Maps or Search. This is true on both mobile and desktop devices.  Google Maps  Google has added a new Q&A; features to Google Maps allowing users to submit questions to owners and allowing these to respond.. This Q&A; feature is tied to the associated Google My Business account.  Google My Business  Google My Business (GMB) is a free tool that allows businesses to create and manage their Google listing. These listings must represent a physical location that a customer can visit. A Google My Business listing appears when customers search for businesses either on Google Maps or in Google SERPs. The accuracy of these listings is a local ranking factor.  Ranking factors  Local Online Marketing Major search engines have algorithms that determine which local businesses rank in local search. Primary factors that impact a local business's chance of appearing in local search include proper categorization in business directories, a business's name, address, and phone number (NAP) being crawlable on the website, and citations (mentions of the local business on other relevant websites like a chamber of commerce website). In 2016, a study using statistical analysis assessed how and why businesses ranked in the Local Packs and identified positive correlations between local rankings and 100+ ranking factors. Although the study cannot replicate Google's algorithm, it did deliver several interesting findings: * Backlinks showed the most important correlation (and also Google's Toolbar PageRank, suggesting that older links are an advantage because the Toolbar has not been updated in a long time). * Sites with more content (hence more keywords) tended to fare better (as expected). * Reviews on GMB also were found to strongly correlate with high rankings. * Other GMB factors, like the presence of photos and having a verified GMB page with opening hours, showed a positive correlation (with ranking) albeit not as important as reviews. * The quality of citations such as a low number of duplicates, consistency and also a fair number of citations, mattered for a business to show in Local Packs. However, within the pack, citations did not influence their ranking: \\"citations appear to be foundational but not a competitive advantage.\\" * The authors were instead surprised that geotargeting elements (city & state) in the title of the GMB landing page did not have any impact on GMB rankings. Hence the authors suggest using such elements only if it makes sense for usability reasons. * The presence of a keyword in the business name was found to be one of the most important factors (explaining the high incidence of spam in the Local Pack). * Schema structured data is a ranking factor. The addition of the 'LocalBusiness' markup will enable you to display relevant information about your business to Google. This includes opening hours, address, founder, parent company information and much more. *The number of reviews and overall star rating correlates with higher rankings in the Google map pack results.  Local ranking according to Google  Prominence, relevance, and distance are the three main criteria Google claims to use in its algorithms to show results that best match a user's query. * Prominence reflects how well-known is a place in the offline world. An important museum or store, for example, will be given more prominence. Google also uses information obtained on the web to assess prominence such as review counts, links, articles. * Relevance refers to Google's algorithms attempt to surface the listings that best match the user's query. * Distance refers to Google's attempt to return those listings that are the closest the location terms used in a user's query. If no location term is used then \\"Google will calculate distance based on what‚Äôs known about their location\\".  Local ranking: 2017 survey from 40 local experts  According to a group of local SEO experts who took part in a survey, links and reviews are more important than ever to rank locally.  Near Me Queries  As a result of both Google as well as Apple offering \\"near me\\" as an option to users, some authors report on how Google Trends shows very significant increases in \\"near me\\" queries. The same authors also report that the factors correlating the most with Local Pack ranking for \\"near me\\" queries include the presence of the \\"searched city and state in backlinks' anchor text\\" as well as the use of the \\" 'near me' in internal link anchor text\\"  Possum Update  An important update to Google's local algorithm, rolled out on the 1st of September 2016. Summary of the update on local search results: * Businesses based outside city physical limits showed a significant increase in ranking in the Google Local Pack * A more restrictive filter is in place. Before the update, Google filtered listings linking to the same website and using the same phone number. After the update, listings get filtered if they have the same address and same categories though they belong to different businesses. So, if several dentists share the same address, Google will only show one of them.  Hawk update  As previously explained (see above), the Possum update led similar listings, within the same building, or even located on the same street, to get filtered. As a result, only one listing \\"with greater organic ranking and stronger relevance to the keyword\\" would be shown. After the Hawk update on 22 August 2017, this filtering seems to apply only to listings located within the same building or close by (e.g. 50 feet), but not to listings located further away (e.g.325 feet away).  Fake reviews  As previously explained (see above), reviews are deemed to be an important ranking factor. Joy Hawkins, a Google Top Contributor and local SEO expert, highlights the problems due to fake reviews: * Lack of an appropriate process for business owners to report fake reviews on competitors' sites. GMB support will not consider requests about businesses other than if they come from the business owners themselves. So if a competitor nearby has been collecting fake reviews, the only way to bring this to the attention of GMB is via the Google My Business Forum. * Unlike Yelp, Google does not show a label warning users of abnormal review behavior for those businesses that buy reviews or that receive unnatural numbers of negative reviews because of media attention. * Current Google algorithms do not identify unnatural review patterns. Abnormal review patterns often do not need human gauging and should be easily identified by algorithms. As a result, both fake listings and rogue reviewer profiles should be suspended.

It is a rare spider orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two cream-yellow or red flowers with narrow, drooping sepals and petals.  Description  Caladenia perangusta is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which sometimes forms small clumps. It has a single erect leaf, long and wide which is pale green with reddish-purplish blotches near its base. One or two flowers long and wide are borne on a stalk high. The flowers are red, creamy-yellow or pale yellow with red markings. The sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped near their base then narrow to a brownish-red, thread- like glandular tip. The dorsal sepal is erect to slightly curved forward, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spread horizontally near the base, then droop. The petals are long and about wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long and wide and cream to red with darker red markings. The sides of the labellum have white-tipped serrations, its tip is curved downwards and there are two rows of anvil-shaped calli up to long, along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early October.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia perangusta was first described in 2015 by Andrew Phillip Brown and Garry Brockman from a specimen collected near Boyup Brook and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (perangusta) is derived from the Latin prefix per meaning \\"very\\" or \\"exceedingly\\" and angustus meaning \\"narrow\\" or \\"slender\\" referring to the thin petals and sepals.  Distribution and habitat  Boyup Brook spider orchid occurs between Frankland and Boyup Brook in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows in wandoo woodland. Conservation Caladenia perangusta is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.

His major work concerned plants in North Africa, where he lived for 15 years. Life Born at York, was the youngest son of Joseph Munby, a solicitor and under-sheriff of Yorkshire, but was orphaned when still very young. On leaving school Munby was apprenticed to a surgeon named Brown in York, and was involved in attending to the poor during the cholera epidemic of 1832. Entering the medical school of the University of Edinburgh, he attended the botanical lectures and excursions held by Robert Graham. Munby then \\"walked the hospitals\\" in London and, in 1835, in Paris, where he began a lifelong friendship with John Percy. Together they studied under Adrien-Henri de Jussieu and his assistants, Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemin and Joseph Decaisne, and Munby passed the examinations for the degree of M.D. at the University of Montpellier. They visited Dijon and, after returning to Edinburgh, started once more, in 1836, for the south of France. Shortly afterwards Munby started work in France at Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges, Haute- Garonne, acting as curator of the museum of N√©r√©e Boub√©e and giving lessons in botany. In 1839 he took up the offer of a free passage from Marseille to Constantinople. Unfavourable winds landed him at Algiers, where he then lived in from 1839 to 1844. He collected plants, grew oranges, shot and practised medicine among the Arabs and French soldiers. On his marriage in 1844 Munby settled at La Senia, a small estate near Oran; in 1859 for his wife's health they moved to Montpellier, where she died in 1860. Munby then returned to England, living first at Wood Green, and in 1867 at the Holt, near Farnham, Surrey. He devoted himself to the cultivation of Algerian plants and bulbs, and died there of inflammation of the lungs on 12 April 1876. Munby was an original member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, and in his later years he joined the Royal Horticultural Society, becoming a member of the scientific committee. He distributed several centuries of \\"Plant√¶ Algerienses exsiccat√¶\\", and on his death his herbarium was presented to Kew Gardens.The name Munbya was given to two genera of plants, both later merged into others. Works Munby's first publications were notes on the botany and entomology of trips with Percy, contributed to the Magazine of Natural History run by John Claudius Loudon and Edward Charlesworth in 1836‚Äì7. He was a vegetable anatomist, collector and acute discriminator of living plants. His two major works were the Flore de l'Alg√©rie and the Catalogus Plantarum in Algeri√¢ ‚Ä¶ nascentium. The Flore de l'Alg√©rie, Paris, 1847, contains eighteen hundred species arranged on the Linn√¶an system, with six plates from drawings by his sister. Two hundred of his species, belonging to thirty genera (ten of those being new to science), were additions to Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines's Flora Atlantica, 1804. The Catalogus Plantarum in Algeri√¢ ‚Ä¶ nascentium, Oran, 1859, contained 2,600 species, of which 800 were new; and the second edition (London, 1866) contained 364 additional species. Family Munby married, first, in 1844, Jane Welsford, daughter of Nathaniel Welsford, the British consul at Oran, who died in February 1860, leaving two sons and three daughters; and, secondly, in 1862, Eliza M. A. Buckeridge, who survived him. Arthur Munby was the son of his brother Joseph.

His early studies during his days at Fox Chase Cancer Center were focused on DNA polymerase and its role in DNA synthesis which elucidated its stability and as well as the mechanism of DNA repair. In 1984, Agarwal and his colleagues conducted studies on Panax ginseng and their work discovered the immunomodulatory properties of the plant which they revealed in an article, Immunomodulatory activity of Panax ginseng extract, published in Planta Medica journal in December, the same year. Researches on the seroepidemiology of malaria, childhood cirrhosis and its polygenic inheritance and antenatal screening for thalassemia incidence were some of the other studies undertaken by him. Under the aegis of the Department of Clinical Immunology of SGPGI-MS, he undertook several projects of the Indian Council of Medical Research which included a study of the genetic effects in the wake of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of December 1984 and a study of Handigodu syndrome prevalent in some parts of Karnataka which he identified as autosomal-dominant spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia.

A world junior 800 metres champion and an All-Africa Games silver medalist, he died in the United States not long after these achievements. Biography Asgedom first came to prominence in 1990 with his performances at the World Junior Championships in Bulgaria, where he won a gold medal in the 800 metres and claimed a bronze medal in the 1500 metres race. In the same year he was a bronze medalist in the 800 metres at the African Championships in Cairo. In 1991 he competed in the World Championships, which were held in Tokyo. Soon after he represented Ethiopia at the 1991 All-Africa Games and finished with the silver medal in the 1500 metres. He came to the United States early in 1992 to attend California's Riverside Community College. In August he got an offer of a scholarship to Wayland Baptist in Texas and spent a week on campus before deciding to decline, due to the lack of a large Ethiopian community, like there was at Riverside. =Death= Asgedom was killed when on 1 September 1992 he was struck by a pickup truck while out running on Washington Boulevard in Pico Rivera, California. He died from his injuries at Whittier Presbyterian Hospital, 25 minutes after being hit. His death was ruled a suicide by the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. The verdict from the Sheriff's Department was based on the results of an autopsy and witnesses accounts. The truck driver said that Asgedom had been standing facing traffic waiting to cross and made eye contact before he dove in front of the incoming vehicle. Two other witnesses corroborated the claim that Asgedom had jumped in front of the truck. His coach, Ted Banks, described Asgedom as a \\"tremendous runner\\" who with some more experience \\"had the potential to be an Olympic medal winner\\".

She has represented the 77th district, which encompasses the cities of North Liberty, Tiffin, Oxford, Swisher, Shueyville, and Lone Tree as well as rural areas surrounding Iowa City to the west and south, since January 2017. Prior to her election to the House, she was Mayor of North Liberty from November 2014 to December 2016. Early life, education, and career Nielsen was born in Keokuk, Iowa in 1978. Due to her father's job in the auto industry, the family moved to Tennessee for a brief time before relocating back to the Iowan community of Hills outside of Iowa City, where both of her parents ended up working for local banks. She attended Iowa City West High School, graduating in 1995. After two years at Kirkwood Community College, she and her husband left Iowa and began to move around the country for his job at Kimberly Clark. Now a stay-at-home mother of three children, she and her family made it back to Iowa, settling down in the rapidly growing community of North Liberty. There, she began serving on the PTO of her children's school and worked on a revenue purpose campaign with the Iowa City School District. She headed multiple campaigns from local school board up to county commissioner and organized a \\"walking school bus\\" project for kids. Nielsen also sat on the board of directors for the North Liberty Community Pantry and served as member of the Iowa City Community School District's Equity Advisory Committee. This experience motivated her to apply for a city council seat that had opened up upon the passing of North Liberty's mayor. Although she wasn't selected, she decided to run for mayor the following year. Despite her relative inexperience and her opponent's stellar record of 15 years public service, Nielsen won with 55% of the vote. In 2015, when Sally Stutsman announced that she would not seek reelection, House leadership reached out to Nielsen, who initially declined. However, after reconsideration, she ultimately agreed and decided to launch a campaign around school funding. She ran against former Tiffin Mayor, Royce Phillips.

It was established around 1935 by Lao Loum ethnic group who used to live in Ban Pha Quang village in Phu Phang Mountain. Ban Pha Quang village is 20 kilometers northeast from Mueang Nan district, Luang Prabang province. When they arrived, they saw this region had immense forested mountain, fertile land, abundant water source in the Huoi Sieu stream, and was convenient for living and farming. They also discovered a big tree with its roots crossing the Huoi Sieu stream like a bridge. The tree root that later was named as Yang, means 'crossing the stream'. Since then, people have called this village Ban Yang.  Geography  Ban Yang is about 45 kilometers south of Luang Prabang city. The village lies at an average altitude of 410 meters above sea level. In November 2016, Luang Prabang district authority and Office of Agriculture and Forestry (DAFO) with the support of SPERI and CCFD legitimized the traditional territory of about 5,300 hectares for Ban Yang. This territory is characterized by diverse topographies such as hill, high mountain, stream and valley. Specially, it includes different spirit forestlands and rich tropical forest located in the upper catchment of the Kuang Si Waterfall. A woman in Ban Yang preparing rice for cooking Ban Yang is bordered by six villages of different ethnic groups, including: Ban Noong Bua Kham and Khokmanh (Khmu and Lao Loum ethnic groups) in Luang Prabang district in the north; Ban Thapene (Kha Hok, Lao Loum, Hmong and Yao ethnic groups), Luang Prabang district and Ban Noong Khoai (Khmu and Hmong ethnic groups) in Xiang Nguen district to the east; Ban Tu Ho and Ban Huoi Long (Hmong ethnic group) in Mueng Nan district in the south, and Ban Huoi Han, Ban Huoi Chia, Ban Huoi Han which are currently merged into Ban Nong Bua Kham next to the Mekong River in the west.  Demography  In December 2016, Ban Yang has 119 families with 447 ethnic Lao Loum people, including 232 women.  Culture  Traditional house style and garden of the Lao Loum in Ban Yang Ban Yang village is home to the Lao Loum ethnic group. Life, culture and prosperity of the people in Ban Yang is tied to nature. So they have established the sacred forests as Pa Xim for worshiping both Buddha and Nature's Spirit, Pa Lieng Phi Ho for worshiping the Spirit of the Village, also known as the Pa-Ho; Pa Leng Nam for respecting the Spirit of the Water Dragon; Pa Khouang for praying to the Spirit of the Forest, and Pa Xa, the Cemetery Forest. Yearly, the entire villagers together give offerings to these Nature's Spirits through traditional festivals. To preserve the traditional religious beliefs, since the establishment, Ban Yang has formed and maintained the unwritten rules to regulate people's behavior to the spirit forests of the community.  Economy  Economy of the village is mainly subsistent, which heavily depends on traditional slash-burn agriculture, growing sorghum, Luang Prabang upland rice, sesame and maize, raising cows and buffalos, and collecting forest products.  Agriculture  Like many other residents in northern Laos, Lao Loum families in Ban Yang still practice the traditional rotational shifting cultivation. This method is translated into practice as 'xong pi ham, xam pi khop', meaning that, production in one specific plot of land for one year is equivalent to two years of the fallow for recovering soil fertility and vegetation. Depending on the need for foods, availability of labor forces and natural resources capital, that each family would decide whether more or fewer pieces of land be included this method of traditional agriculture. Slash-and- burn and poking holes for planting seeds are the main technics of the traditional rotational shifting cultivation. On a piece of sloping agricultural land villagers often practice intercropping between different local varieties such as Khao Hay (local upland rice), Mac Duoi (sorghum), Mac Nga (sesame) and Xa Ly (corn). Presently, villagers in Ban Yang also grow Mac Thua Dao (Plukenetia volubilis) as a new crop introduced from outside. These crops are rotationally planted and mixed. A specific crop variety is often never fixed in a plot of farmland but is rotated through a shifting cultivation cycle of 3‚Äì4 years or longer.

It existed until 1964 when the Admiralty Department was abolished and merged within a new Ministry of Defence. Responsibilities Before the First World War the Admiralty was usually divided up for administrative reasons into branches, departments, divisions and sections, they were all individually responsible for the managing and maintaining their own records, each function were supposed to send all their finished documents to the record office for filing and preservation, this however did not happen due to constant organisational changes that were common place at the Admiralty. Those branches that were outside the remit of the Admiralty Secretariat did not always adhere correctly to internal procedures resulting in a loss of crucial documents.

Early life Vlasova was born in 1942 in Moscow, Soviet Union to Iosif Markov, a musician. Her mother worked in Red Army Theatre, but after marriage to Markov left the scene for the family life. After the war, her mother broke up with her father, and Lyudmila Vlasova ended up raising single-parented. Her mother realized the daughter's potential of becoming a ballerina, and turned her to choreography school. Career Following graduation, Lyudmila Vlasova joined Bolshoi Theatre with which she performed in London and USA and danced with such greats as Maya Plisetskaya, Ekaterina Maximova, Natalia Bessmertnova and many others. Lyudmila Vlasova was the leading ballerina of the Bolshoi Theatre, where in 1971, acting in the movies Naughty Limericks and Keystone, she met with Alexander Godunov. Soon they began to meet regularly and Lyudmila left her wealthy husband for him. They were one of the most beautiful couples in the Bolshoi Theatre of the 1970s. The couple headlined foreign tours as well as the domestic productions of Swan Lake, Spartacus, Ivan the Terrible, Anna Karenina, The Rite of Spring, Love for Love, and Romeo and Juliet. On August 19, 1979, after the last performance of their Romeo and Juliet tour in the Metropolitan Opera, Vlasova and Godunov returned to their New York hotel. The day after, however, the New York Post published a picture of Alexander Godunov with a headline: \\"After Baryshnikov, Nureyev, and Makarova, another star of Soviet ballet remained in the West\\". A few days later, Godunov contacted the US authorities with a request for political asylum. After news of his request reached the Soviet authorities, Lyudmila Vlasova was asked to board a flight to Moscow alone.

After winning on her racecourse debut she was beaten in her other seven races as a two-year-old although she was placed in the Marble Hill Stakes, Silver Flash Stakes and Round Tower Stakes. In the following spring she won the Leopardstown 1000 Guineas Trial before recording her biggest success when taking the Irish 1,000 Guineas as a 20/1 outsider. She thus became the first Classic race winner trained by Aidan O'Brien. Classic Park did not win again despite running well in important races over one mile and was retired at the end of the year. As a broodmare she was best known as the dam of Walk In The Park who finished second in The Derby and became a successful National Hunt sire. Background Classic Park was a bay mare bred in England by Lady Halifax. As a yearling in October 1995 the filly was consigned to the Tattersalls sale at Newmarket and was bought for 30,000 guineas by Emerald Bloodstock. She entered the ownership of Seamus Burns' County Kilkenny-based White Lodge Stud competed during her racing career in the colours of Burns' wife Patricia. Burns later commented \\"I just saw her in the sale-ring and liked her, and bought her on a hunch\\". She was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien who had just begun his career at Ballydoyle. She was sired by Robellino, a son of Roberto, who won the Royal Lodge Stakes in 1980. At stud Robellino sired several good winners over a wide variety of distances including Mister Baileys, Royal Rebel and Rebelline (Tattersalls Gold Cup). Classic Park's dam Wanton showed good form as a two- year-old, winning one race and finishing third in the Flying Childers Stakes. Apart from Classic Park, she also produced the Diana Stakes winner Rumpipumpy and was a half-sister to Easy Option, the dam of Court Masterpiece. Racing career =1996: two-year-old season= Classic Park began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at the Curragh on 13 April and won by three and a half lengths at odds of 5/1. She was moved up in class for the Listed Marble Hill Stakes over the same course and distance in May and finished third of the seven runners behind Raphane. Nine days later Leopardstown Racecourse she was moved up in distance for the six furlong Silver Flash Stakes and finished runner-up to the Jim Bolger-trained Azra. On 19 June she was sent to Royal Ascot and finished sixth behind Dance Parade in the Group Three Queen Mary Stakes. Four weeks later in the Curragh Stakes she finished fourth behind Raphane after disputing the lead in the early stages. After a late summer break the filly returned in the Round Tower Stakes at the Curragh on 8 September and finished second, beaten a head by the Dermot Weld-trained Desert Ease. She showed little form in her two remaining races, finishing unplaced in both the Listed Blenheim Stakes at the Curragh on 5 October and the Two-Year- Old Trophy at Redcar Racecourse twelve days later. =1997: three-year-old season= On 19 April 1997 Classic Park began her second season in the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes in which she was ridden for the first time by Stephen Craine and started a 14/1 outsider in an eight-runner field. Her stablemate Shell Ginger (winner of the Killavullan Stakes) started favourite ahead of Token Gesture (C L Weld Park Stakes), Azra and the John Oxx-trained Chania. After starting slowly she was still in last place on the final turn but began to make progress on the outside in the straight. She moved into third place approaching the final furlong, caught Chania in final stride and won by a short head. Craine was again in the saddle when Classic Park was stepped up to Group One class for the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh on 24 May and was made a 20/1 shot against nine opponents. The race featured a strong British challenge comprising Ryafan (the Prix Marcel Boussac winner and 3/1 favourite), Oh Nellie (runner-up in the 1000 Guineas), Seebe (Princess Margaret Stakes) and Dazzle (Cherry Hinton Stakes). The best fancied of the Irish runner was the O'Brien-trained Strawberry Roan, the winner of the Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial and the selection of the stable jockey Christy Roche. After racing towards the rear of the field as Oh Nellie set the pace Classic Park began to make progress on the inside in the straight and went to the front a furlong from the finish. She broke clear of her rivals and held off the challenge of Strawberry Roan to win by a length. After training the longest priced winner in the history of the race Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Looking back on her two-year-old career, we probably took the wrong road by confining her to five and six furlongs. She finished really well to take her trial at Leopardstown, and it was the same tactics here ‚Äì hold her up as long as possible. She quickened very well when Stephen asked and won on merit\\". Classic Park was matched against the English 1000 Guineas winner Sleepytime in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 19 June. After being held up at the rear as usual she made some progress but never looked likely to win and finished fourth of the six runners behind Rebecca Sharp. She faced male opposition for the first time in 1997 when she returned to Britain for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July and finished fifth of the nine runners behind the four-year-old colt Ali-Royal with Air Express and Alhaarth finishing behind her.

The soundtrack and score for the film is composed by Veer Samarth and the cinematography is by Guru Prashant Rai. Plot The movie revolves around the life of Captain Shivraj (Shiva Rajkumar). The film opens with the issue of Bangladeshi infiltrators thriving in Bengaluru with the help of the politicians who practice vote-bank politics. Shivraj, along with his two associates Viji and Guru, drives out Bangladeshi infiltrators by spreading widespread rumours that they are going to be attacked. He also locks horns with the corrupt Chief Minister of Karnataka (Prakash Belawadi) and also takes strong actions against drug mafia and other illegal activities. An underworld Don from Mangaluru is tasked to kill Shivraj, but he later turns a loyalist. In the second half of the film, flashback happens were Shivraj is a patriotic Indian Army captain in Kashmir with a loving wife (Pranitha Subhash) and his siblings, parents and a child. His sister unknowingly falls for a Pakistani. The family is slayed by a terror plot, leaving his child handicapped. The rest of the story is how Shivraj avenges the deaths of his parents, wife and sister, by finishing off the terrorist leader behind the plot.

As compared to fluorescent tubes, the most important advantages of LED tubes are energy efficiency and long service life. LED tubes are sometimes also referred to as ‚ÄòLED fluorescent tubes‚Äô, but since the light actually comes from LED components and the tubes contain no fluorescent substance, ‚ÄòLED tube‚Äô is more correct.  General  LED tube with specific starter Specific lampholder with direct connection between AC and lamp contacts Dummy starters In December 2014 was completed a standard for LED tubes (EN2776) that guarantees a safe replacement of the traditional T8 Fluorescent tube. Thanks to the standard, it is possible to replace old fluorescent tubes with LED tubes and use standardised LED tubes regardless of brand. There are several different types of LED tubes available for T8 fluorescent lamp replacement: # LED tubes based on Retro-Fit design can typically be installed in place of former fluorescent tubes in compatible luminaires as they are, with consideration of manufacturer and lamp-specific restrictions. Some models are only compatible with magnetic ballasts, but models that can be installed in any old fluorescent tube luminaire are also available on the market. In some Retro-Fit LED tubes, a special LED starter is used in place of the fluorescent lamp starter. Re- introduction of fluorescent lamps is still possible merely by lamp and starter replacement. If used in luminaires equipped with compensation capacitors, LED tubes often generate a lot of reactive power. Most LED tubes based on Retro- Fit design are manufactured according to the LED tube standard EN62776. # In case of Conversion Kit design-based installations, old luminaires and their wiring are modified for LED tube introduction. In such cases, the installation works need to be performed by a qualified electrical contractor. Modification targets often include fluorescent lamp luminaires with so-called electronic ballast. # LED tubes that are only available as part of a dedicated lighting fixture. The package may also include control electronics that are external to the LED tube, and the LED tubes do not comply with the LED tube standard EN 62776. Retro-fit LED tubes (installation method 1 above) can also often be installed in fixtures designed for LED tubes. In these cases, the fixture typically only acts as a frame or holder to the tube, and electricity supply to the tubes uses the conductors in the fixture. The LED tube may also be compliant with standard EN 62776. # LED tubes that are compatible with an electronic (HF) ballast. These LED tubes require a fixture that includes a functioning electronic ballast. This type has the advantage of easy upgrade of the LED tube (compared to installation method 2). Expensive maintenance is a downside. In addition to the LED tube, also the electronic ballast may fail, and it can only be replaced by a qualified electrician. If a LED tube that is compatible with an electronic ballast is installed in an old fluorescent fixture, the question of responsibility must be clarified. Who will be liable for the electronic ballast if it breaks when the LED tube is being installed? The original supplier of the fixture and the coupling device will no longer be responsible if LED tubes with an electronic ballast are used. Therefore, it is worth considering whether electronic ballasts should be scrapped when LED tubes are fitted in old fixtures, particularly in extensive switchover projects. The term retro-fit is also used to refer to these tubes, as the new LED tube will fit into the old fixture without modification. In these cases, the LED tubes may also be compliant with the EN 62776 standard. # LED tubes compatible with the narrow T5 fluorescent tubes are also being introduced to the markets. They mainly comply with types 3 and 4 above: they are delivered as part of a lighting fixture with external control electronics, or they require a T5 fixture with electronic ballast. The LED tube standard EN 62776 is based on the international standard IEC 62776http://standards.globalspec.com/std/9963140/cei-en-62776 (Double-capped LED lamps designed to retrofit linear fluorescent lamps ‚Äì Safety Specifications), which applies to LED tubes compatible with a magnetic as well as an electronic ballast.  History  The exact birth time of LED tubes is difficult to establish, but most of the patents on the subject originate from the 2000s. The development of white LEDs in early 2000s made it possible to use LEDs for general lighting. Until 2012 LED tubes were mainly manufactured in China. However, since then, manufacture or assembly have also been launched in Finland, for example. ; 1st generation of Retro-Fit LED tubes : So-called 1st generation Retro-Fit LED tubes were introduced on the market between 2005 and 2010, and not much attention was paid on quality or safety. In 2010, European safety authorities, including the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency, ruled that the risk of electricity flowing through a LED tube during the installation stage should be avoided. This refers to a situation where one end of a LED tube is connected to the luminaire and the other, free end becomes energized. The ruling resulted in numerous sales bans and product recalls. Products complying with 1st generation electrical connection are still available on the market. ; 2nd generation of Retro-Fit LED tubes : The second generation of LED tubes became commonplace (especially in Nordic countries) immediately after the safety ruling of 2010. In second-generation LED tubes, the risk of installation-related electric shocks that plagued the 1st generation was resolved by a new type of electrical connection. The connection differs from that of the 1st generation by that it utilises the starter wire present in luminaires for the conveyance of electricity through the luminaire to the other end of the tube. In most cases, the solution replaces the starter by a special LED starter that short-circuits the starter branch. ; 3rd generation of Retro-Fit LED tubes : The so-called 3rd generation LED tubes currently on the market resolve the insufficient luminosity problem characteristic to their 1st and 2nd generation counterparts. Since the light emitted by LED tubes is beam-like, the performance (measured in lx) of LED tubes as compared to fluorescent lamps of comparable size has also significantly depended on luminaire placement and optics. Some luminaire frames reflect the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides quite well, while others waste almost all but the light emitted downwards. Especially 1st and 2nd generation LED tubes of lesser luminous power failed to match the performance of fluorescent lamps if the luminaire included wide optics with good reflecting characteristics and only accommodated a single fluorescent/LED tube. Such luminaires are capable of maximizing redirection of the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides back into the room. In case of 3rd generation LED tubes, efforts have been made to solve this problem by increasing their luminous power, so that it would be sufficient under any circumstances, regardless of the luminaire. As a result, however, the tube surface brightness surpasses that of fluorescent lamps, and in some cases, individual bright LED components can have a disturbing effect. Today, several manufacturers offer 3rd generation LED tubes, but the excessive luminous power is generally accompanied by increased electricity consumption. ; 4th generation of Retro- Fit LED tubes : The 4th generation of LED tubes focuses on solving well-being related issues of general lighting. Recently, several studies aimed at flickering of electric lights have been conducted. According to these studies, the flickering of traditional fluorescent lamps can cause brain stress and anxiety. The 4th generation of LED tubes offers a solution to the flickering problem. The flickering is measured using so-called flicker index or flicker percentage value. Elimination of flickering allows high-quality video recording and slow motion capture, as well as certain machine vision applications in premises equipped with flicker-free lights.http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-11/issue-4/features/developer- forum/proper-driver-design-eliminates-led-light-strobe- flicker.htmlhttps://valtavalo.fi/blogikirjoitukset/valtavalos-flicker- free-g4-led-tube-was-a-success-in-an-international-led-tube- comparison/?lang=en  Technology  10-watt LED tube with G13/T8 socket LED tubes are usually produced using a large number of low or medium-power LEDs. With the help of these, light output and heat conduction are balanced out across the entire tube length. The operating temperature of LED tubes is lower as compared to traditional lighting technologies, and a LED tube produces less heat than traditional fluorescent lamps. Among the most important properties of LED tubes is the possibility of light direction ‚Äì the entire luminous power of a LED tube can be directed in a narrower beam to wherever the light is required. Owing to the directivity and good luminous efficacy, LED tubes provide illuminance equal to that of other lighting technologies at lower electric power consumption. LED tubes are typically made of durable plastic and aluminium, which means that they will not shatter. The technical development of LED tubes has been fast throughout their entire marketing period. Luminous efficacy has reached even 150lm/w. Similarly to other retrofit light sources, a LED tube requires control gear to function. In general, the control gear is integrated into the LED tube, but it can also be located outside the actual light source.  Applications  LED tubes can be used for general lighting purposes at all locations, with the exception of locations where both upwards and downwards lighting is required. These include, for example, office luminaires suspended from the ceiling and emitting light upwards and downwards. At present, LED tubes are mainly used in premises where the lights need to be on a lot. In such cases, the lighting- related power consumption savings will quickly offset the more expensive acquisition price. Typical applications include industrial production premises, public premises, stores, warehouses, parking garages, and refrigeration rooms/equipment. Furthermore, at premises where light source installation is complicated and expensive, LED tubes should be preferred owing to their longer service life and installation cost savings. LED tubes are also an excellent choice to accompany motion detectors, since they light up and go out immediately, and the number of On/Off switchings has less impact on LED tube service life, compared to that of fluorescent tubes.  Colour temperatures  LED tubes are available with colour temperatures comparable to those of other lighting technologies. However, colder colour temperatures are more favourable in case of the LED technology. The warmer is the light achieved by the LED technology, the more are the benefits characteristic to the technology sacrificed (luminous power, for example).  Advantages  = Easy maintenance = In principle, anyone can replace a LED tube. In case of products based on the Retro-Fit installation approach, LED tubes contain all the electronics required, which means that in the event of LED tube failure, replacement or even fluorescent tube reinstallation is simple. = Electricity consumption = As compared to T8 fluorescent lamp technology, LED tubes can reduce electricity consumption by more than 50%. Installation and maintenance cost savings can also be expected, since the service life of LED tubes is typically 3-5 times longer than that of fluorescent lamps. LED tubes constitute an excellent choice for cold room lighting, since the reduced heat generation allows additional savings through reduced refrigeration-related energy consumption. = Recyclability = At the end of their life cycle, LED tubes must be disposed of as recyclable waste electrical and electronic equipment, and the product manufacturer/importer is required to take care of recycling arrangement. In most cases, recycling service arrangement is outsourced to a nationwide operator and collection points are available at most localities. Manufacturer/importer-specific differences are possible in the arrangements. As opposed to fluorescent lamps, mercury or heavy metals are generally not used in LED tubes. = Service life = The service life of LED tubes depends on the mechanical design, quality of LED components, implemented heat management, and quality of other electronic components used. According to the manufacturers, in favourable conditions, the service life of LED components can be up to 100,000‚Ä¶300,000 hours. In case of many LED tubes available on the market, the actual service life is shorter, due to the poor quality of electronic components used. In addition to product design, materials used, and assembly, the service life also significantly depends on the operating temperature and usage periods. If a LED tube is allowed to cool between usage periods, this is likely to have a positive effect on the service life. The service life is also longer in cold rooms, whereas in case of higher temperatures, the LED components lose their illumination efficiency faster and the electronics failure rate increases. Of course, the manufacturers have been unable to conduct absolute service life tests so far, since testing the products continuously for 100,000 hours would take more than 11 years.  Challenges  LED tubes are among the first LED lamp types for which an international harmonized standard has been established (IEC/EN 62776). The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) completed the standardisation process on 11 December 2014. The standardisation process created the preconditions for the manufacture of LED tubes compatible with traditional T8 fluorescent lamps. The standard also defines the properties of LED tubes, in order to ensure mutual compatibility and user safety. However, non-compliant LED tube products are still available on the market, in the case of which insufficient attention has been paid to safety. For example, the installation- related electric shock hazard addressed earlier by TUKES (The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency) still exists in case of some products on the market. The CE marking does not guarantee safety.https://valtavalo.fi/blogikirjoitukset/too-good-to-be-true-are-led- lights-really-as-good-as-promised/?lang=en  References   Sources * LED tube-related guidelines published by TUKES on 28 April 2014.

Life Born on 21 June 1772, at the Twohouse in Haltwhistle, Northumberland, he was eldest son of Fenwick Martin and his wife Isabella Thompson; Jonathan Martin (1782‚Äì1838) and John Martin (1789‚Äì1854) the artist were brothers. He was brought up by his mother's parents, who in 1775 moved to Kintyre in western Scotland, to farm. On their deaths, he went to live with his father, then in business at Ayr. Etching of York Minster by William Martin, noting its arson by his brother, Jonathan Martin In 1795 Martin joined the Northumberland regiment of militia, at Durham, and was discharged in 1805. With some mechanical talent he started to dabble in patents, selling one for a perpetual motion machine in 1808. In 1809 he returned to rope-making, a previous occupation, and in 1810 to the militia. In Ireland with his regiment, he worked at line engraving. Martin in 1814 was presented with the Isis silver medal by the Society of Arts for the invention of a spring weighing machine, with circular dial and index. With marriage, at this period he became the representative \\"local character\\" and pamphleteer in Newcastle upon Tyne, the eccentric inventor documented at the end of the 19th century by Richard Welford. The \\"Martinean Society\\" publicised by Martin opposed the Royal Society and the Newtonian theory of gravitation. He called himself \\"Anti-Newtonian\\" and lectured on his views in the Newcastle district. In 1830 he made an extended lecturing tour of England. In 1837 he exhibited in Newcastle a mail carriage to be propelled on rails by means of a winch and toothed wheel. He dressed oddly, sold his books and exhibited his inventions, which included models for a lifeboat and a lifebuoy, a miners' lamp, a self- acting railway gate, and a design for a high-level bridge over the River Tyne. John Bailey Langhorne described him as \\"perfectly cracked but harmless\\", and recalled how he used to wear his Society of Arts medal in public. Martin's last years were passed at his brother John's house in Chelsea, London, where he died on 9 February 1851.

In the liner notes to the album, Brubeck notes that \\"These sketches of Eurasia have been developed from random musical phrases I jotted down in my notebook as we chugged across the fields of Europe, or skimmed across the deserts of Asia, or walked in the alleyways of an ancient bazaar. ... I tried to create an impression of a particular locale by using some of the elements of their folk music within the jazz idiom.\\" The album was recorded in July and August 1958 at the Columbia 30th St. Studios in New York. Music Brubeck composed the six pieces for the album‚Äîalong with \\"Blue Rondo √† la Turk,\\" which appeared on the group's signature album of the following year, Time Out‚Äîwhile on tour across Eurasia. The opening piece, \\"Nomad,\\" was inspired by the drums that nomads in Turkey used to ward off wild dogs. It opens with Joe Morello's tom-tom riff and includes a Paul Desmond solo described as \\"a focused beam of moonlight glinting off the caravan's trappings.\\" The Bach-inspired \\"Brandenburg Gate\\" features fugue-like interactions between Brubeck and Desmond. This piece was re-recorded three years later in an extended version with symphony orchestra and eventually released on the album Brandenburg Gate: Revisited (1964). Like the opening piece, \\"The Golden Horn\\" was inspired by Turkey, specifically the rhythm of \\"choktasha-keraderam,\\" the Turkish words for \\"thank you.\\" Likewise, the next piece, subtitled \\"Dziekuje,\\" comes from the Polish word for \\"thank you,\\" and was inspired by a visit to a museum dedicated to Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, where Brubeck was fascinated by a cast of Chopin's hands and by his piano. Brubeck noted that the piece's melody is deliberately \\"Chopinesque,\\" and it was rapturously greeted by a Polish audience when first performed. \\"Marble Arch\\" was inspired by a structure in Hyde Park, London, and features a solo by bassist Joe Benjamin.

Brubeck's piano phrases imitate a sitar, while Morello's extended drum solo imitates a tabla. While in Bombay, Brubeck had joined a jam session with sitarist Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan. Brubeck later noted that Khan's influence made him \\"play in a different way.\\" The album precedes the somewhat similar concept of The Far East Suite by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, inspired by a similar State Department world tour, which appeared eight years later.Peter Lavezzoli, The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Bloomsbury Academic, 2007, pp. 296-7.

It yields a randomized allocation of indivisible items among several agents that is both envy-free and Pareto efficient. It was suggested by Herv√© Moulin and Anna Bogomolnaia.  Description  Each item is represented as a loaf of bread (or other food). Initially, each agent goes to their favourite item and starts eating it. It is possible that several agents eat the same item at the same time. Whenever an item is fully eaten, each of the agents who ate it goes to their favorite remaining item and starts eating it in the same way, until all items are consumed. For each item, the fraction of that item eaten by each agent is recorded. These fractions are considered as probabilities. Based on these probabilities, a lottery is done. The type of lottery depends on the problem: * If each agent is allowed to receive any number of items, then a separate lottery can be done for each item. Each item is given to one of the agents who ate a part of it, chosen at random according to the probability distribution for that item. * If each agent should receive exactly one item, then there must be a single lottery that picks an assignment by some probability distribution on the set of deterministic assignments. To do this, the n-by-n matrix of probabilities should be decomposed into a convex combination of permutation matrices. This can be done by the Birkhoff algorithm. It is guaranteed to find a combination in which the number of permutation matrices is at most n2-2n+2. An important parameter to PS is the eating speed of each agent. In the simplest case, when all agents have the same entitlements, it makes sense to let all agents eat in the same speed all the time. However, when agents have different entitlements, it is possible to give the more privileged agents a higher eating speed. Moreover, it is possible to let the eating speed change with time.  Example  There are four agents and four items (denoted w,x,y,z). The preferences of the agents are: * Alice and Bob prefer w to x to y to z. * Chana and Dana prefer x to w to z to y. The agents have equal rights so we apply PS with equal and uniform eating speed of 1 unit per minute. Initially, Alice and Bob go to w and Chana and Dana go to x. Each pair eats their item simultaneously. After 1/2 minute, Alice and Bob each have 1/2 of w, while Chana and Dana each have 1/2 of x. Then, Alice and Bob go to y (their favourite remaining item) and Chana and Dana go to z (their favourite remaining item). After 1/2 minute, Alice and Bob each have 1/2 of y and Chana and Dana each have 1/2 of z. The matrix of probabilities is now: > Alice: 1/2 0 1/2 0 Bob : 1/2 0 1/2 0 Chana: 0 1/2 0 1/2 Dana: 0 1/2 0 1/2 Based on the eaten fractions, item w is given to either Alice or Bob with equal probability and the same is done with item y; item x is given to either Chana or Dana with equal probability and the same is done with item z. If it is required to give exactly 1 item per agent, then the matrix of probabilities is decomposed into the following two assignment matrices: > 1 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1  0 1 > 0 0 One of these assignments is selected at random with a probability of 1/2.  Properties  = Fairness = PS satisfies a fairness property called stochastic-dominace envy-freeness (sd-envy-free). Informally it means that each agent, considering the resulting probability matrix, weakly prefers his/her own row of probabilities to the row of any other agent. Formally, for every two agents i and j: * Agent i has a weakly-higher probability to get his best item in row i than in row j; * Agent i has a weakly-higher probability to get one of his two best items in row i than in row j; * ... * For any k ‚â• 1, agent i has a weakly-higher probability to get one of his k best items in row i than in row j. Note that sd-envy-freeness is an ex-ante fairness notion: it is fair only before the lottery takes place. The algorithm is of course not ex-post fair: after the lottery takes place, the unlucky agents may envy the lucky ones. But this is inevitable in allocation of indivisible objects. = Efficiency = PS satisfies an efficiency property called stochastic-dominace Pareto efficiency (sd-efficiency, also called: ordinal efficiency). Informally it means that, considering the resulting probability matrix, there is no other matrix that all agents weakly-sd-prefer and at least one agent strictly-sd- prefers. Here, the ex-ante notion of sd-efficiency is stronger than the ex- post notion: sd-efficiency implies that every allocation selected by the lottery is sd-Pareto-efficient. = Strategy = PS is not a truthful mechanism: an agent who knows that his most preferred item is not wanted by any other agent, can manipulate the algorithm by eating his second-most preferred item, knowing that his best item will remain intact.  Improvements  As explained above, the allocation determined by PS is fair only ex-ante but not ex-post. Moreover, when each agent may get any number of items, the ex-post unfairness might be arbitrarily bad: it is possible that one agent will get all the items while other agents get none. The PS-lottery algorithm is an improvement of PS in which the lottery is done only among deterministic allocations that are envy-free-except-one-item (EF1). This guaratees that the ex-post allocation is \\"not too unfair\\". Moreover, the EF1 guarantee holds for any cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal ranking, i.e., it is stochastic-dominance EF1 (sd-EF1). The algorithm uses as subroutines both the PS algorithm and the Birkhoff algorithm.  See also  * Random priority - an alternative mechanism with different properties.

In 1938, the park was seized by the city, obtained via eminent domain, with support from the Public Works Administration and United States Housing Authority, for the site of Rosewood Courts, a federally funded public housing project for African Americans and part of Austin's city planners' scheme to further segregate the community. Rosewood became one of the only green spaces available to Black Austinites. During this period, the park constructed a recreation center, swimming pool, and bathhouse, designed by prominent Houston architect William Ward Watkin. The buildings have been used for after-school and summer programs for children, community meetings, and classes for youth and adults. The park fell into disrepair in the 1970s after wealthier blacks left the Third Ward during the integration process. By 2007 it had stopped hosting Juneteenth celebrations. In 2006, Carol Parrott Blue and Bill Milligan, natives of the Third Ward, formed \\"Friends of Emancipation Park\\" in order to revitalize the park.Blue, p. 17. The board was established in March 2007. On November 7, 2007 the Houston City Council declared the park a historic landmark after it voted unanimously to do so. In 2011, the city government planned to establish a capital campaign to install new facilities at the park. It spent $2 million in its own money and secured $4 million in funding from the local government corporation OST/Almeda Corridors Redevelopment Authority as well as $1 million in funding from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In 2012, Mayor of Houston Annise Parker made requests for donations in order to secure additional funding. The renovation project had a cost of $33 million.

These specimens mostly agree with Blume's collections from Java except for having a glabrous midrib underneath. King annotated the herbarium sheet with \\"the Andaman specimen may be Cryptocaria caesia Blume or a new species\\" because he could not complete the identification of the Andaman specimen due to lack of fruits in Blume's specimen.

Launch of Falcon 9 carrying ORBCOMM OG2-M1 Falcon 9 carrying CRS-7 Dragon on SLC-40 pad SpaceX employees with the Dragon capsule at SpaceX HQ in Hawthorne, California, February 2015 Overview In 2001, Musk conceptualized \\"Mars Oasis\\", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse containing seeds with dehydrated gel on Mars to grow plants on Martian soil, \\"so this would be the furthest that life's ever traveled\\" in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the budget of NASA. But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive without a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology. In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as Lavochkin and ISC Kosmotras. However, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and the group returned to the US empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing Mike Griffin, who had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and was just leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. However, this was seen by Musk as too expensive and Musk left the meeting. While on the return flight Musk realized that he could start a company which could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration‚Äîprincipally for cost reasons; around 85% of the entire Falcon/Dragon vehicle is produced in-house‚Äî and the modular approach from software engineering (Falcon 9 uses 9 of the Merlin engines, which were tested on the single engine Falcon 1, Falcon Heavy uses three Falcon 9 booster stages), SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin. Another reason for vertical integration was Musk's belief that reusable rockets could not be built with components from existing aerospace suppliers. For example, SpaceX had to design a machine that could friction stir weld aluminium-lithium alloy for the airframe of the Falcon 9 because such a machine did not exist. According to Musk SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket (Falcon 1 with about half a ton to orbit) instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company. In early 2002 Musk was seeking staff for the new company and approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller, now SpaceX's CTO of Propulsion. SpaceX was first headquartered in a 75,000 square feet warehouse in El Segundo, California. Musk decided SpaceX's first rocket would be named Falcon 1, a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon. Musk planned for Falcon 1's first launch to occur in November 2003, 15 months after the company started. In January 2005 SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology. By March 2006, Musk had invested in the company. On August 4, 2008 SpaceX accepted a further $20 million investment from Founders Fund. In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of the company were owned by its founder and his 70 million shares were then estimated to be worth $875 million on private markets, which roughly valued SpaceX at $1.3 billion as of February 2012. After the COTS 2+ flight in May 2012, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4 billion. On 16 June 2009 SpaceX announced the opening of its Astronaut Safety and Mission Assurance Department. It hired former NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox to oversee the department as a vice president of the company. However, it has since been reported that the former astronaut subsequently left SpaceX in late 2011. No reason was given and no replacement in that position has been announced. In 2012 SpaceX advertised a launch price of $57 million on Falcon 9, while Arianespace was advertising a launch price of $137 million per launch. In 2012 an initial public offering (IPO) was perceived as possible by the end of 2013, but then Musk stated in June 2013 that he planned to hold off any potential IPO until after the \\"Mars Colonial Transporter is flying regularly\\", and this was reiterated in 2015 indicating that it would be many years before SpaceX would become a publicly traded company, where Musk stated that \\"I just don‚Äôt want [SpaceX] to be controlled by some private equity firm that would milk it for near-term revenue\\" Falcon 9 rocket's first stage on the landing pad after the first successful vertical landing of an orbital rocket stage. Falcon 9 first stage on an ASDS barge after the first successful landing at sea. The company has grown rapidly since it was founded, growing from 160 employees in November 2005 to more than 500 by July 2008, to over 1,100 in 2010, 1,800 in early 2012, and 3,000 by early 2013. The company had grown to 3,800 employees and contractors by October 2013, and had \\"nearly 5,000\\" in late 2015SpaceX‚Äôs Redmond effort ‚Äòvery speculative‚Äô November 7, 2015, accessed 2016-02-04 and February 2016. After the setback of the launchpad explosion, SpaceX successfully got back to flying on 14 January 2017, with its launch of Iridium satellites. On February 19, 2017, a Falcon 9 carrying CRS-10 conducted the first launch from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A. The first stage of the launch planned on the end of February, 2017 will be the recovered and refurbished one from April 8, 2016. On May 23, 2019 SpaceX successfully deployed the first 60 of around 12,000 satellites in its planned Starlink - which it aims to use to provide low latency network communications via a large constellation in low Earth orbit (LEO). On May 30, 2020, SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during SpaceX Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed launch from American soil in 9 years. The mission launched from Launch Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX Demo-2 successfully docked with the ISS on May 31, 2020 and returned the astronauts safely on Aug 2, 2020. Goals The third Falcon Heavy awaiting launch at Kennedy Space Center, June 2019 Musk has stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten. In 2004 the company plans called for \\"development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand\\", with each size increase resulting in a significant decrease in cost per pound to orbit. Musk said: \\"I believe $500 per pound ($1,100/kg) or less is very achievable.\\" A major goal of SpaceX has been to develop a rapidly reusable launch system. , including a test program of the low-altitude, low-speed Grasshopper vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) technology demonstrator rocket, and a high-altitude, high-speed Falcon 9 post-mission booster return test campaign where‚Äîbeginning in mid-2013, with the sixth overall flight of Falcon 9‚Äîevery first stage will be instrumented and equipped as a controlled descent test vehicle to accomplish propulsive-return over-water tests. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell said at the Singapore Satellite Industry Forum in summer 2013 \\"If we get this [reusable technology] right, and we‚Äôre trying very hard to get this right, we‚Äôre looking at launches to be in the range, which would really change things dramatically.\\" Musk stated in a 2011 interview that he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10‚Äì20 years. In 2010, Musk's calculations convinced him that the colonization of Mars was possible. In June 2013, Musk used the descriptor Mars Colonial Transporter to refer to the privately funded development project to design and build a spaceflight system of rocket engines, launch vehicles and space capsules to transport humans to Mars and return to Earth. In March 2014, COO Gwynne Shotwell said that once the Falcon Heavy and Dragon 2 crew version are flying, the focus for the company engineering team will be on developing the technology to support the transport infrastructure necessary for Mars missions. In August 2020, SpaceX indicated it was looking to build a resort in South Texas with the intent to turn \\"Boca Chica into a '21st century Spaceport\\".SpaceX is hiring a Spaceport resort developer for its Texas rocket factory, Teslarati, 11 August 2020.  Achievements  Major achievements of SpaceX include: * The first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket (Falcon 1) to reach orbit (28 September 2008) * The first privately funded company to successfully launch (by Falcon 9), orbit and recover a spacecraft (Dragon) (9 December 2010) * The first private company to send a spacecraft (Dragon) to the International Space Station (25 May 2012) * The first private company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit (SES-8, 3 December 2013) * The first private company to send a probe beyond Earth orbit (Deep Space Climate Observatory, 11 February 2015) * The first landing of a first stage orbital capable rocket (Falcon 9, Flight 20) (22 December 2015 1:39 UTC) * The first water landing of a first stage orbital capable rocket (Falcon 9) (8 April 2016 20:53 UTC) * The development of the most powerful operational rocket as of 2020 (Falcon Heavy, first flight 6 February 2018) * The first private company to send humans into orbit (Crew Dragon Demo-2, 30 May 2020)  Setbacks  On March 1, 2013, a Dragon spacecraft in orbit developed problems with its thrusters. Due to blocked fuel valves, the craft was unable to properly control itself. SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages. Because of this, it arrived the International Space Station one day later than expected. Since spacecraft like the Dragon were classified as munitions, and considered weapons under arms regulations until November 2014, SpaceX Mission controllers were unable to release more information to the public.\\"Spacex Gagged By Arms Rule.\\" New Scientist 217.2907 (2013): 4‚Äì5. Academic Search Complete. Web. 4 Nov. 2015. On June 28, 2015 CRS-7 launched a Falcon 9 carrying an unmanned Dragon capsule intended to take supplies to the International Space Station. 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight a cloud of vapor was seen by the tracking camera forming outside the craft. A few seconds afterwards there was a loss of pressure in the helium tank, after which they exploded, causing a complete failure of the mission.\\"CRS-7 Investigation Update\\". SpaceX. 20 July 2015. Retrieved 11 November 2015. The software was not programmed to deploy the parachute for the Dragon capsule after a launch mishap, therefore the Dragon broke up on impact. The problem was discovered to be a failed 2 ft (61 cm) steel strut, purchased from a supplier, on a helium pressure vessel, which broke due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed helium to escape causing the loss of the spacecraft, which exploded. The software issue was also fixed; in addition an analysis of the entire program was carried out in order to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for future rockets and their payload.Nasr, Reem. \\"Musk: This Is What Caused the SpaceX Launch Failure.\\"CNBC. Consumer News and Business Channel, 20 July 2015. Web. Retrieved 4 November 2015. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell stated that in terms of the differences between the six previous successful Falcon 9 Commercial Resupply Launches, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing that stands out as being different for any particular flight.‚Äù Though the craft was set to bring a resupply of food and water to the ISS, the crew members had enough supplies to last another 4 months before another resupply, which would end up being the Russian Progress 60P vehicle.Calandrelli, Emily. \\"Understanding The Aftermath Of SpaceX‚Äôs Failed Falcon Launch.\\" TechCrunch. 29 June 2015. Web. 4 Nov. 2015. Student science experiments as well as a docking adapter and other miscellaneous cargo were lost due to CRS-7 failure as well.SpaceX CRS-7. Orlando: NASA, June 2015. PDF. On September 1, 2016, a Falcon 9 Full Thrust launch vehicle exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre- launch static fire test at Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 40. There were no reported injuries, as the area was cleared for the test. However the payload, the Spacecom Amos-6 communications satellite valued at $200 million, was destroyed. Spacecom claims its contract, since the launch failed, allows it to choose to receive $50 million or a future flight at no cost. Musk described the event as the \\"most difficult and complex failure\\" ever in SpaceX's 14-year history; SpaceX reviewed nearly 3,000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a period of 35‚Äì55 milliseconds for the postmortem. In late September, SpaceX stated that interim results suggested that a major breach of the cryogenic helium system of the second stage rocket had occurred. In November 2016, Musk reported the explosion was caused by the liquid oxygen used as the oxidizer turning so cold that it became a solid, and it may have breached the helium pressure vessels which are immersed in the liquid oxygen. The vessels are overwrapped with a carbon composite material. The solid oxygen, under pressure, could have ignited with the carbon material causing the explosion.Elon Musk says SpaceX finally knows what caused the latest rocket failure The Verge, November 7, 2016 SpaceX concluded its investigation on 2 January 2017 then successfully restarted its business of launching rockets in January 2017. On January 23, 2019, SpaceX Starhopper fell over and sustained damage due to strong winds in Texas.https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194398/spacex-starship-prototype- wind-damage-boca-chica-texas In November 2019, the Mk1 test article in Texas came apart in a tank pressure test, and SpaceX stated they would cease to build the Mk1 and Mk2 vehicles (Mk2 under construction in Florida) and move on to work on the Mk3 (later renamed SN1) article. A few weeks later, the work on the vehicles in Florida slowed down substantially, with some assemblies that had been built in Florida for those vehicles being transported to the Texas Starship assembly location, and a reported 80 percent reduction in the workforce at the Florida assembly location as SpaceX pauses activities there. Apparently, at the same time the Mk4 vehicle under construction in Florida was canceled. In February 2020, Starship SN1 was destroyed when undergoing pressurization as well. The work then focused of the next prototype, Starship SN2.https://spacenews.com/second-starship-prototype-damaged-in-pressurization- test/ In May 2020, Starship SN4 exploded erupting in a dramatic fireball during a test of its Raptor Rocket Engine. The work then focused of the next prototype, Starship SN5. Funding Successful SpaceX launches by year SpaceX is privately funded. It developed its first launch vehicle‚ÄîFalcon 1‚Äîand three rocket engines‚ÄîMerlin, Kestrel, and Draco‚Äîcompletely with private capital. SpaceX contracted with the US government for a portion of the development funding for the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which uses a modified version of the Merlin rocket engine. SpaceX is developing the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle, the Raptor methane-fueled rocket engine, and a set of reusable launch vehicle technologies with private capital. , SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion in its first ten years of operation. Of this, private equity provided about $200M, with Musk investing approximately $100M and other investors having put in about $100M (Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, ...). The remainder has come from progress payments on long-term launch contracts and development contracts. , NASA had put in about $400‚Äì500M of this amount, with most of that as progress payments on launch contracts. By May 2012, SpaceX had contracts for 40 launch missions, and each of those contracts provide down payments at contract signing, plus many are paying progress payments as launch vehicle components are built in advance of mission launch, driven in part by US accounting rules for recognizing long-term revenue. In August 2012, SpaceX signed a large development contract with NASA to design and develop a crew-carrying space capsule for the \\"next generation of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities\\", in order to re-enable the launch of astronauts from U.S. soil by 2017. Two other companies, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation, received similar development contracts. Advances made by all three companies under Space Act Agreements through NASA's Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) initiative are intended to ultimately lead to the availability of commercial human spaceflight services for both government and commercial customers. As part of this agreement, SpaceX was awarded a contract worth up to $440 million for contract deliverables between 2012 and May 2014. At the end of 2012 SpaceX had over 40 launches on its manifest, representing about $4 billion in contract revenue. Many of those contracts were already making progress payments to SpaceX, with both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers., SpaceX has a total of 50 future launches under contract, two-thirds of them are for commercial customers. In late 2013, space industry media began to comment on the phenomenon that SpaceX prices are undercutting the major competitors in the commercial commsat launch market‚Äîthe Ariane 5 and Proton-M‚Äîat which time SpaceX had at least 10 further geostationary orbit flights on its books. In January 2015 SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.333% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion. Google and Fidelity joined the then current investorship group of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Although the investment was thought to be related to SpaceX's launch of a Starlink constellation effort, Gwynne Shotwell said in March 2015 that the investment was not specifically for the global internet project. Google had been searching for a satellite internet partner since the split with O3b Networks and OneWeb.

It was released on Steam Early Access on March 17, 2017 for Microsoft Windows with additional platforms slated for Q3 2017 including PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game features melee and ranged combat, inventory management, player- driven dialogues and weapon customization that is made possible through item crafting. The plot focuses on Buck, a motorcycle garage mechanic who decides to leave everything he knows behind in order to find the truth behind a girl's disappearance. Buck had a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised just above the goal of $30,000.  Gameplay  Buck is a single-player side- scrolling brawler where the player controls Buck, a lonely garage mechanic who knows how to fight and build weapons. The game currently features three weapons: a sawed-off shotgun, heavy melee exhaust pipe and a pair of custom- made revolvers. Each weapon has a specific function to counter different enemy types throughout the game. Each weapon can be upgraded in four different ways and it's up to the player to decide which weapon to upgrade and in what order. Buck has basic melee attacks that can be combined with any of his equipped weapons, resulting in a multiple solution approach to every combat encounter. Buck can dodge enemy attacks to gain a short but crucial invulnerability window to escape or re-position. Attacking and Dodging costs stamina which is a finite resource with a short recovery cooldown. Buck will also need to engage with characters in the world where fully voiced dialogues are included. The player will need to choose Buck's answers and determine his personality. These dialogues occur in the game's 'safe-zones' or town hubs; the first of which is Westown. Safe zones like Westown is where the player goes to unlock new missions and move the plot forward. Mission levels are designed with branching paths, random enemy spawns, hidden loot caches and percentage-based loot drops from enemies to encourage returning to previously explored areas. Levels have light platforming elements where the player can use Zip-lines, elevators, slides, ladders and platforms to get across the level. Buck's HUD includes his Health, Stamina and ammunition count. He has access to his Inventory, fast-travel map and journal as well. Item management plays a key- role in the game since Buck can only carry up to 10 items. Most items can stack up to 4 before taking an additional slot but crafting recipes require at least three different materials. The player can't take all the item he finds, some will have to be dropped in favor of crafting other components. *Note that some gameplay elements might be subject to change until Buck finishes his development on Steam Early Access.  Plot  The story of Buck will unfold as Early Access development continues. The game follows the character of Buck from the moment he decides to leave the comfort of his home to venture out into the unforgiving wasteland. Ignoring his step-dad's advice, he leaves his home to try to find out what happened Jodie, a female that spent some time with Buck at his garage/home. The story is told through the narration of Buck's step-father, Grit. An old and gravely voiced Vulture.  Development  Development on Buck began on February 2013. However the concept art, characters, plot and initial art-assets were made in 2002. The game's director, Gal, was 12 years old when he decided to make a game about his dog. His older brother, Adi Katz, who does all the art for the game, has helped him design the characters and the world they inhabit. The plot, style and tone of the game has changed dramatically over the years. The plot and tone of the game has undergone many iterations. Gal said that once the real Buck had died, the story became much grimmer and darker. Today, he describes the game as a sort of \\"Metroidlike, Apocalpytic-Noir brawler\\". Gal cited multiple sources of his inspiration, including Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Sin City, Waterworld, The Blues Brothers and most notably the anime Series Trigun. The team still uses the sole proprietor name \\"Wave Interactive\\" but has since opened a company called Rainfall Entertainment which is based in the UK. Reception  The game and its kickstarter campaign were noticed by the gaming press.

Life Born at Cork, Ireland on 19 March 1826, he was the second son of John Hennessy of Ballyhennessy, County Kerry, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Casey of Cork; John Pope Hennessy was a younger brother of Henry's. Educated at Cork under Michael Healy, he as a Roman Catholic in the 1840s did not seek a university education, but took up the profession of an engineer. In 1849 Hennessy was made librarian of Queen's College, Cork, and in 1855, on the invitation of John Henry Newman, he became professor of physics at University College, Dublin. In 1874 he transferred his services to the Royal College of Science, Dublin, where he was appointed professor of applied mathematics. He was dean of the college in 1880 and again in 1888. Hennessy was made a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1851, and was its vice- president from 1870 to 1873. He was also elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1858. In 1890 Hennessy resigned his chair at 65, under the new rules for superannuation in the Civil Service. A memorial to the government protesting against his retirement was without effect. For financial reasons he went abroad, but returning to Ireland under medical advice, he died on 8 March 1901, at Bray, County Wicklow. Works In Hennessy's first paper from 1845, in the Philosophical Magazine, he proposed to use photography for the registration of barometric and thermometric readings. In Researches in Terrestrial Physics (Philosophical Transactions, 1851) he argued from the figure and structure of the Earth and planets, that they were of fluid origin, and that a fluid nucleus at a high temperature was enclosed within their crust. He also wrote on meteorology and on climatology, deducing laws which regulate the distribution of temperature in islands. 'On the Influence of the Gulf Stream Proc. Roy. Soc. 1857‚Äì9 led to a request to report on the temperature of the seas surrounding the British Isles for the Committee on Irish Fisheries in 1870. Among Hennessy other proposals was one for a decimal system of weights and measures, based on the length of the polar axis of the Earth, rather than the Earth's quadrant, on which the metric system is based. Standards such as the polar foot and the polar pound, and a complete set of weights and measures on the polar system, constructed under Hennessy's supervision, were stored in the Museum of the Royal College of Science, Dublin. In the same museum were models of his mechanical inventions, one of them illustrating the structure of sewers best adapted to obtain the greatest scour with due provision for storm water Cf. Hydraulic Problems on the Cross- sections of Pipes and Channels', Proc. Roy. Soc. 1888. He published also: * On the Study of Science in its Relation to Individuals and Society, Dublin, 1858; 2nd edit. 1859. * On the Freedom of Education (a paper at the Social Science Congress, Liverpool, in 1858), 1859. * The Relation of Science to Modern Civilisation, 1862.

A fan triangulation is a simple way to triangulate a polygon by choosing a vertex and drawing diagonals to all of the other vertices of the polygon. Not every polygon can be triangulated this way, so this method is usually only used for convex polygons.  Properties  Aside from the properties of all triangulations, fan triangulations have the following properties: * All convex polygons, but not all polygons, can be fan triangulated. * Polygons with only one concave vertex can always be fan triangulated, as long as the diagonals are drawn from the concave vertex. * It can be known if a polygon can be fan triangulated by solving the Art gallery problem, in order to determine whether there is at least one vertex that is visible from every point in the polygon. * The triangulation of a polygon with n vertices uses n - 3 diagonals, and generates n - 2 triangles. * Generating the list of triangles is trivial if an ordered list of vertices is available, and can be computed in linear time. As such, it is unnecessary to explicitly store the list of triangles, and therefore, many graphical libraries implement primitives to represent polygons based on this triangulation. * Although this triangulation is fit for solving certain problems, such as Rasterisation, or collision detection, it may be unfit for other tasks because the origin vertex accumulates a high number of neighbors, and the internal angles of the triangulation are unevenly distributed.

His life has become part of Jakarta folklore, and inspired numerous literary works. Life Born in 1827, Oey was the son of Oey Thai Lo, also known as Oey Thoa, a Chinese- born tycoon and tobacco magnate, originally from Pekalongan, Central Java, who had been appointed Luitenant der Chinezen of Kongsi Besar in Batavia. This was a civil government position in the colonial bureaucracy with legal and political jurisdiction over the local Chinese community. As the son of a Chinese officer, Oey Tamba held the hereditary title of Sia; and his family belonged to the Cabang Atas or the traditional Chinese establishment of colonial Indonesia. A litograph of Batavia, based on a drawing by C. Deeleman (1859). Aged 15 years old, Oey Tamba Sia lost his father, Luitenant Oey Thai Lo, who died in 1838, leaving his children a large fortune that supposedly amounted to 2 million guilders. Local folklore has it that, although handsome and fashionable, the young Oey was an arrogant young man and a notorious womanizer - character flaws that were compounded by his enviable inheritance. Oey was married to Sim Hong Nio. The late colonial writer Phoa Kian Sioe alleges that Oey was dismissive of the city's Chinese officers, who were his late father's friends and colleagues in the colonial bureaucracy. In particular, Oey was disrespectful towards Tan Eng Goan, 1st Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia, head of the city's Chinese community, because the latter had relied on Oey's father for financial support. According to Phoa, Oey spurned the exasperated Majoor's Confucian exhortations for gentlemanly behaviour and his offer of a Chinese lieutenancy. Oey developed instead a fierce rivalry with the Majoor's son-in-law, Lim Soe Keng Sia. Oey ordered the killing of Sutedjo, brother of his concubine Mas Adjeng Goendjing, whom he mistakenly thought was her lover. Oey also masterminded the poisoning of his servant Oey Tjeng Kie in order to implicate his rival, Lim Soe Keng Sia. Although Lim, the Majoor's son-in-law, was initially and scandalously apprehended by the authorities, further police and court investigations revealed Oey as the mastermind of both murders. The Landraad (or criminal court) sentenced Oey Tamba Sia to death by public hanging. Oey's family attempted an appeal to the Raad van Justitie (or high court) and for clemency from the Governor-General, both of which were rejected. At dawn on October 7, 1856, Oey Tamba Sia was hanged to death on Batavia's main town square in front of the Stadhuis, or town hall (now the Jakarta History Museum). Tjoa Boan Soeij's Oeij Tambah Sia (first edition, second volume) Cultural and literary significance The case of Oey Tamba Sia scandalized colonial Jakarta because it involved figures from the very heart of the city's Chinese establishment, including Oey himself, his rival Lim and the latter's father-in-law, Majoor Tan Eng Goan. The scandal attracted international media attention at the time, and was ‚Äî for instance ‚Äî covered in a lengthy news article in the French magazine L'Illustration (1857). The rivalry between Oey and Lim further was seen in subsequent literature as a cautionary tale of lack of Confucian virtue, which necessitated a reestablishment of the Confucian ethical and social order. The scandal inspired a series of folk stories, poems and novellas in the Dutch East Indies, and became part of Jakarta folklore, as well as the Chinese-Indonesian collective memory. In 1903, Thio Tjin Boen published Tambahsia: Soewatoe tjerita jang betoel soedah kedjadian di Betawi antara tahoen 1851-1856, based on Oey's life. Not long after, in 1906, Tjoa Boan Soeij published a story in verse, entitled Sair swatoe tjeritajang betoel soeda kedjadian di Tanah Betawi dari halnja Oeij Tambah Sia, tatkalah Sri Padoeka toean besar Duymaer van Twist mendjabat Gouverneur General koetika tahoen 1851. Tjoa published another work in 1922 based on Oey's life, called Tambah Sia. In 1956, the historian and writer Phoa Kian Sioe published Sedjarahnja Souw Beng Kong (tangan-kanannja G.G. Jan Pieterszoon Coen), Phoa Beng Gan (achli pengairan dalam tahun 1648), Oey Tamba Sia (hartawan mati ditiang penggantungan), a collection of historical anecdotes about the Chinese community of Jakarta. Oey's life also partly inspired Atilah Soeryadjaya's 2013 musical, 'Ariah'.

On 16 February 2018, just over a year after his imprisonment began, Y√ºcel was released. On 28 June 2019, the Constitutional Court of Turkey ruled that the detention of Y√ºcel had been unlawful. Y√ºcel received strong public support in Germany throughout his imprisonment. The Twitter hashtag #FreeDeniz was active and popular.

His body was found later that day. He had been brutally killed by the Taliban and the reason for McLaren's disappearance away from the base has been the subject of much speculation. Background McLaren, who was from Sighthill in Edinburgh, had joined the British Army in August 2009 and after initial infantry training at Catterick, he was posted to B Company, 4 Scots who were based at Bad Fallingbostel in Germany at that time. His fellow infanteers nicknamed him F1 on account of his athletic prowess and also as a reference to his surname. McLaren deployed to Afghanistan with the 4th Battalion as a Rifleman in April 2011. His section was attached to the 1st Battalion Battlegroup and on the 3 July 2011 this group deployed to Checkpoint Salaang in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand Province. Disappearance and death Whilst they were at a smaller vehicle checkpoint north of Checkpoint Salaang on the 3 July 2011, a colleague of McLaren's had left behind some night-vision goggles. When they withdrew to the safety of the base, the missing goggles were highlighted and McLaren was the last person to see them. Later that night, at 2:19 am (local time) on the 4 July, McLaren left the base on his own ostensibly to search for the missing kit. It was noted that he had talked about going back for the goggles. McLaren's absence was formally registered at 4:00 am (local time) and sparked a massive manhunt that drew in friendly forces from outside of the UK military sphere. McLaren's disappearance coincided with a visit to Afghanistan by the then British Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron was quoted as saying \\"throw everything you have got at trying to pick up this young man\\", rather than being taken of a tour around the district. Despite an intensive 17-hour search, Highlander McLaren was found dead in a nearby river from the base. He had been tortured, shot five times in the head with a semi-automatic rifle and after death, his body had been interfered with. His body was repatriated to the United Kingdom on the 12 July 2011 through RAF Lyneham accompanied by the usual cortege through the streets of Wootton Bassett. McLaren's funeral was held at Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh on the 26 July 2011. McLaren's death brought the total of British military deaths to 375 since operations began in 2001. Inquest and allegations of abuse At the inquest deciding on how Highlander McLaren died, Wiltshire and Swindon coroner David Ridley said \\"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Scott was captured by insurgent forces and ultimately was executed by insurgent forces on the morning of July 4; therefore, for those reasons, the conclusion I am going to record is that Scott McLaren was unlawfully killed while on active service in Afghanistan.\\" When McLaren left the base (an event that was not observed by the guards at the camp gates) CCTV captured him as he walked south. His route to the vehicle check point should have taken him north over a canal bridge. It has not been properly explained as to why McLaren went in the opposite direction which led him into a Taliban held area known as \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" An Afghan Army General claimed that McLaren had gone swimming with two ANA troops, was separated and drowned with the Taliban abusing his body when they found it. The Taliban claim that he was taken hostage but was killed during a firefight. Both these scenarios were denied outright by military authorities with emphasis on the second being that no fighting was recorded in the area at the time of McLaren's capture. In September 2015, when the campaign to have Sergeant Alexander Blackman released from prison was being vaunted in the press, McLaren's mother, Ann McLaren, petitioned the imprisoned Marine to reveal what he knew about her son's death. At his murder trial he declined to answer questions about McLaren's death in order to avoid any further anguish to the family. On the day of McLaren's disappearance, he had been instructed to get his team on the ground and start searching, initially without clear orders as to why, but later being told that there was a 'Man Away' scenario. The family claim that McLaren was subject to abuse and bullying for being quiet, shy and an outsider. When he left the base in July 2011, he packed all his possessions into his kit bag and \\"snuck past\\" the guards. Hours before he left, he had been seen in tears studying a map of the district. The family also said that his military friends have told them that he was being bullied. McLaren's father, James, said that the truth was inconvenient for the army; pointing out that if his son could get out of the base undetected, someone could get in. He also said that the typical wait for a service family to have an inquest into a death would be two years; his son's inquest came after only 5 months.

The house was built by Isaac Heffron, a prominent Galveston contractor in the Victorian period and during the city's recovery from the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. Later, the house was the residence of T.J. Holbrook, a Texas state senator from 1922 to 1939. Isaac Heffron Isaac Heffron was born in Cardiff, Wales in either 1853 or 1858. He immigrated to United States in 1860 and settled in Galveston, Texas.‚ÄúHeffron Services to be Held Today,‚Äù The Galveston Daily News; August 10, 1928. Beginning in 1881, he worked as a stevedore for the firm Munn, Fry, and Company. He remained with the firm until 1885, by which point it had been renamed Fry and Heffron.Galveston City Directories, 1881-1885. As Heffron's career developed, he completed increasingly large construction projects and received substantial contracts from the City of Galveston, including one for the construction of a railroad, including a trestle bridge, connecting Galveston to La Porte, Texas.‚ÄúHeffron Services to be Held Today,‚Äù August 10, 1928. =Galveston Sewer Company= During the middle of the nineteenth century, Galveston suffered a public health crisis. The city lacked an organized waste management system. The worst problem was human waste.McComb, David G. Galveston: A History. Austin: Texas University Press, 1986, pp.93-99. In 1886, Heffron founded the Galveston Sewer Company and was awarded a contract from the City of Galveston to begin laying pipes for a system of surface water and waste drainage. For a fee, Heffron offered homeowners the ability to connect their private homes to the central cement pipes, which deposited runoff into the Galveston Bay. In the following years, he continued to expand the sewage system, initially focusing on the portion of town bound by 14th Street, Broadway, 27th Street, and the bay. By 1899, the system included eight miles of cement pipes and connected 430 properties. In 1892, during the midst of the project, the city awarded Heffron's company a 50-year franchise to install sewage pipes in the city.Burns, Chester R. and Heather Campbell. \\"Sanitizing Galveston: Politics, Policies, and Practices before 1915.\\" The Houston Review; 19, number 1. 1991, pp. 12-13. Between 1896 and 1901, Heffron and city officials engaged in acrimonious negotiations regarding the future of the sewage system. A growing portion of the city's population believed that the public, rather than a private company, should maintain ownership. Heffron believed that his contract guaranteed that the city could only take control of the system through purchasing it. Some city leaders, including city attorney Waverley Smith, believed that the original agreement was unlawful and, therefore, the city had no obligations to the Galveston Sewer Company. The debate persisted for several years, complicated by the devastation brought by the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. Heffron shrewdly used newspaper publicity in effort to sway public opinion toward his perspective.\\"Suggests a Remedy,\\" The Galveston Daily News; February 2, 1896. Finally, in 1901, a court ordered Galveston Mayor Walter C. Jones to pay the full purchase price of $93,600.Burns and Campbell, \\"Sanitizing Galveston: Politics, Policies, and Practices before 1915,\\" 16-19. 1509 Postoffice In October 1881, Heffron acquired the property at 1509 Postoffice Street in Galveston from David Fahey.‚ÄúReal Estate Transfers.‚Äù The Galveston Daily News; October 16, 1881.

Heffron and his wife Clotilde resided in the house until 1890, when they demolished it and constructed a two-story house in the same footprint. They may have incorporated portions of the earlier building into the 1890 house.Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, 1889 and 1899. =Architectural description= The 1890 Isaac Heffron House is a two-story, four-bay, urban Victorian house with turned columns, a two-story tri-partite bay window, and a central entrance. Compared to other noted architectural examples of the period in the East End district, the house has more restrained details. Its placement on a constrained urban lot between other houses limited Heffron's ability to employ other common Victorian elements, such as turrets and wrap-around porches. The footprint of the 1890 Isaac Heffron House as seen in the 1899 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map of Galveston. The tall two-over-two windows of the first story are characteristic late nineteenth century features and they are indicative of the use of the porch as an extended living space in the subtropical climate. The rear, southern porch illustrated in the 1899 Sanborn Map is typical of north-facing houses that sought to capture incoming breezes from the Gulf of Mexico.Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, 1899. While there is no evidence that Heffron hired an architect for the project, the lot bears signs of his personal influence as a contractor, most notably in the concrete balustrade at the front of the lot. =Heffron Residence= The Heffron family lived in the house through the 1890s while Isaac's career continued to advance and his wealth increased. In 1899, he commissioned architect Charles W. Bulger to design a new house for the family at 511 17th Street.Beasley, Ellen and Stephen Fox. Galveston Architecture Guidebook.

After a two-year stay in Dallas, he returned to Galveston in 1921 and was elected state senator in 1922. Over the course of his tenure in office from 1922 to 1939, he was a leader in efforts to construct a 1930 causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland and to add a psychiatric hospital to the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch.

Starring Late Sushant Singh Rajput, Jacqueline Fernandez, Vikramjeet Virk and Sapna Pabbi, the story of the film revolves around the manhunt for an infamous 'King' for a robbery of 300 kilograms of gold. An undercover agent infiltrates a street racing gang who is chasing the King. The film was scheduled to release on 7 September 2018, but was pushed to 28 June 2019, ultimately to not see a theatrical release. It was directly released on Netflix on 1 November 2019. Plot Vibha Singh is a corrupt bureaucrat in the Accounts Department of the Indian Government who pushes many of her clients into giving her \\"percentages\\" of their money which may either have been stolen or confiscated. With the support of her assistant Hamid, she continues to do so and keeps hiding the money in a basement of the Rashtrapati Bhavan which is only known to her, and resumes her lifestyle until she receives news from Kirit Ojha, the Honorary Secretary to the Prime Minister, that her help is needed critically by the Prime Minister for a certain task, and Ojha sends his man, Irfan to work with them and start an investigation from within their department to avoid being caught, as the investigation in question is against the notorious criminal King, who has recently stolen jewels from a jewelry house owner Mehta, and has claimed that his next target would be the Rashtrapati Bhavan. For the same, a hacker from the technical department, named Raj, is chosen to decipher messages of the gang. Hamid and Irfan go on to investigate a street racing gang whose members have been striving hard to get close to King. The gang, composed of the leader, Tara and her associates and friends Bikki and Naina, indulges in illegal street racing, and while Irfan speculates that a certain Arjun can infiltrate the gang and earn more information on King, a man appears out of nowhere. The man, Samar, disrupts Tara when she tries to meet a recent street race winner, and wins Tara's trust by regaining the car given to him along with some money, when he loses both upon being caught by a policeman, Rathore. Through the very course of events that follows suit, Samar bonds well with Tara, Bikki and Naina, holidaying with the group in Israel for the next few days, when Irfan realizes, along with Singh and Hamid, during that several messages that they have been receiving ostensibly as customer care offer messages are actually coded messages. They ask Raj to decipher the railcode messages, and discover that King's loot is located near the Gopigunj police station. Tara receives the message and sets out with Bikki and Naina to retrieve it, with the police, headed by Irfan and Hamid, in hot pursuit, when it is revealed that the infiltrator, Arjun, was part of the street racing gatherings, and has been able to take the lead against the trio, but Tara, Bikki and Naina are then saved by a mysterious entity, who is then revealed to be Samar himself. Admitting himself to be King, even as he used the name as a simple criminal alias to commit robberies, Samar gets the group going on the coveted Rashtrapati Bhavan robbery, which is aimed to get them their hands on Singh's money, and their plan begins to work, but days later, much close to the heist, Irfan realizes that Raj was actually allied with King, and puts him to interrogation, hampering the hacking aspects of the group's plan. On the eve of the heist, Samar relays to Tara that he will legitimately convert the stolen money to diamonds and store them in the Museum of London, and even as Bikki and Naina get married, Samar gets an alternate plan ready to be executed. The heist works perfectly well when Irfan, Hamid and Singh are put off their guard, with Singh being knocked unconscious and her money stolen, but during the mighty escape to the airport, where Tara fools Samar and make sure that he is caught by the police, which is when Tara reveals to him that she is King, and it was impulsive for her to betray him for all his smartness. Irfan and Hamid catch up with Samar and arrest him. Two months later, Tara has changed identity of a random Mrs. Khan, and goes to the Bank of London, with Bikki behind her, to store her diamonds in a vault. However, on the spot, she sees Mr.Sharma(Samar) and realizes that he is the vault manager of london bank, and she soon realizes that Irfan, who then appears before her, was actually Samar's boss, and that Samar was let in on as the early Ojha. A shocked Tara, along with a helpless Bikki, then walks away with Samar and Irfan into the vault and they steal the diamonds in the vault.

Petr van Blokland (born 1956, Gouda) is a Dutch graphic designer, software author and typeface designer who lives in Delft.  Contributions to typeface technology  He has made numerous important contributions to the adoption of software in typeface design. He was a co-author of Ikarus M, the first typeface design software for Macintosh computers. Alongside his brother Erik van Blokland and Just Van Rossum, he created RoboFOG, a system for writing scripts to streamline typeface design work in then market-dominating type design software Fontographer. RoboFOG (and its successor RoboFAB) spearheaded a technological revolution in type design revolving around the core technologies of RoboFOG, that is Python programming, the programming assets created with the software, and the ethos that the small group evangelised, \\"build your own tools\\". A technological movement began around this, revolving around the Type and Media masters course that the three all teach at. Petr co-founded TypeNetwork, an online typeface marketplace, with Font Bureau, David Berlow, Roger Black and others, with the intention of creating a new model for type design, development and licensing.  Typeface design  Blokland has authored a number of typefaces, the most notable being the influential Proforma and its sibling Productus. Proforma, an oldstyle- serif typeface, started out as a commissioned typeface for Danish digital typesetting company Purup Electronics. FontShop International, while creating its 100 best typefaces of all time list described it as \\"groundbreaking at the time for the way that it combined economy of space with good readability\\". The impact of the Proforma design was such that in 1988 Petr received the infrequently-awarded Prix Charles Peignot for distinguished typographic achievement by a designer under 35. The companion sans-serif typeface, Productus, was published by Font Bureau in 2000.

Description The Norman had an overall length of 296.5 feet, a 40.4 foot beam, 21 foot hold depth, and a gross tonnage of 2,304 tons. It had a raised forecastle and pilothouse, an aft cabin that housed the propulsion machinery, and an open deck in between that held eight hatches. The Norman was powered by a triple expansion steam engine built by Globe Iron Works that produced 1200 horsepower, along with two 14 foot by 12¬Ω foot Scotch boilers. History The Norman was built in 1890 by the Globe Iron Works in Cleveland, Ohio. She was one of the first propeller-driven steel lakers that hauled iron and coal on the Great Lakes. She was built for the Chapin Iron Mining Company, and ran between the company's docks in Escanaba, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio. On May 30, 1895, the Norman was loaded with coal and headed to Escanaba. Dense fog reduced visibility, and the steamer Jack () collided with the Norman, with the Jack hitting the Norman amidships and nearly slicing her in two. The Norman quickly sank, taking three crewmen with her. The remainder of the crew were picked up by the Jack and the nearby steam barge Sicken. Salvage efforts in 1896 failed. The wreck The wreck was not located until 1986. She lies in 210 feet of water, and much of the below deck area is accessible to divers. It sits angled on the lake bottom with its starboard side pointing up towards the surface. There is large opening from the collision amidships. A davit, capstan, deck cleats, and the two bow anchors are all extant on the bow section. The foremast and mainmast are in place, rising roughly 60 feet. The aft section is separated from the remainder of the ship. The steam engine and the boilers are exposed. The wreck sits near the wreck of the wooden freighter Florida.

Life Born in Dublin on 14 March 1822, he was from a Scots-Irish background, the third son of Vicars Armstrong Boyle; his mother was Sophia, eldest daughter of David Courtney of Dublin. After education at a private school and two years' service on the trigonometrical survey of Ireland he became a pupil to Charles Blacker Vignoles. When he had finished his articles, he was engaged on railway construction in Ireland, at first as assistant to William Dargan, who employed him on the Belfast and Armagh and the Dublin and Drogheda Railways. In 1845, under Sir John Benjamin Macneill, he surveyed and laid out part of the Great Southern and Western Railway, and in 1846‚Äì7 was chief engineer for the Longford and Sligo Railway. In the autumn of 1852, he laid out railways and waterworks in Spain as chief assistant to George Willoughby Hemans, son of Felicia Hemans. In 1853 Boyle was appointed a district engineer on the East Indian Railway. At first he was stationed at Patna, and was then transferred to Arrah. On the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, towards the end of July, troops in the cantonments at Danapur, about twenty-five miles from Arrah, mutinied and deserted, Boyle fortified a detached two-storey house in the same compound as his own private residence, and provisioned it to withstand a siege. Here on Sunday, 26 July, 16 Europeans and about 40 Sikhs took refuge, and the following morning mutineers crossed the Son River and took possession of Arrah. They besieged the house, which held out until sunset on 2 August. Then a relief force from Buxar under Vincent Eyre drew off the rebels. Boyle was thereupon appointed field-officer to Eyre's force and worked on restoring broken communications and bridges. A few days later he was disabled by a kick from a horse. He was summoned to Calcutta, and while travelling down the River Ganges in the steamer River Bird was wrecked on the Sunderbunds. After a sea-trip to Penang and Singapore for his health, he returned to Arrah early in 1858. For his services, Boyle received the Indian Mutiny Medal and a grant of land near Arrah. In 1868, after leaving the East Indian Railway Company, he became a first-class executive engineer in the Indian public works department, but was then recalled to England by private affairs. He was made C.S.I. in 1869. From 1872 to 1877 Boyle was in Japan as engineer-in-chief for the Japanese Government Railways, succeeding Edmund Morel. With English assistants he laid out an extensive system of railways in Japan and left about seventy miles of completed line in full working order. Boyle joined the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1874. On retiring in 1877, he spent time travelling. He died at 3 Stanhope Terrace, Hyde Park, London on 3 January 1908, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Works To the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he became an associate on 10 January 1854 and member on 14 Feb. 1860, Boyle presented in 1882 a paper on the Rokugo river bridge, Japan.Proc. Inst. C.E. lxviii. 216. It spanned the Tama River, joining present-day ≈åta, Tokyo to Kawasaki City. After successive floods had damaged bridges at the site, the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1688 had decreed that no replacement should be built, and for nearly two centuries ferries plied across the Tama there. Under Boyle a rail bridge was constructed in 1877, of cast iron, with the components imported from the United Kingdom. It survived floods in 1878 that swept away a new toll bridge that had been built nearby. Rokug≈ç in the 1860s, before the bridge Family Boyle married in 1853 Eleonore Anne, daughter of W. Hack of Dieppe. They had one son, who died in infancy.

He was the subject of an urban myth that he was previously Adolf Hitler's \\"pet alligator\\". After hatching in Mississippi, Saturn was brought to Germany, residing at the Berlin Zoological Garden. It was here that his association with Adolf Hitler originated, as Hitler reportedly enjoyed visiting the zoo and especially liked the alligator. However, while Hitler may have viewed Saturn at the zoo, he was never Hitler's personal pet. During World War II, the Berlin Zoo was destroyed, but Saturn was discovered by British soldiers three years later. The British then gave the alligator to the Soviets in 1946. He lived at the Moscow Zoo until 22 May 2020, when he died of old age.  Physical description  Saturn was described as having been 2 to 3.5 meters long, and weighed 200 kilograms (441 pounds). Like most alligators, he had green scales, a broad mouth, and yellow eyes.  Berlin Zoological Garden  Saturn was hatched in the wild in the U.S. state of Mississippi in 1936. He was captured that year and was shipped to Berlin, where he was brought to the Berlin Zoological Garden. It was from this period that the popular rumor emerged that Saturn was Adolf Hitler's \\"pet\\". This may have originated with the author Boris Akunin, a Russian writer who hypothesized in an article that this may have been the case. In actuality, he was not Hitler's personal pet, as he was on public display at the zoo. However, some sources report his display at the zoo as being part of a personal menagerie of Hitler's, while Dmitry Vasilyev, a veterinarian at the Moscow Zoo, contends that while Saturn was not Hitler's pet, the two certainly came into contact, as Hitler was known to have visited the Berlin Zoo on occasion. During World War II, much of the Berlin Zoo was destroyed. Of the zoo's 16,000 animals, only 96 survived. When the aquarium building was destroyed by a bomb on 23 November 1943, 20 to 30 alligators and crocodiles were killed. Press reports documented that the streets near the aquarium were littered with alligator and crocodile corpses, but that some, including Saturn, had survived and were wandering through the city in search of food. Moscow Zoo At the close of the war, the Berlin Zoo area came under the jurisdiction of the British Zone of Occupation. In 1946, British soldiers discovered Saturn, and brought him to Leipzig, then part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, where they gave Saturn to the Soviets. Because the Moscow tourism office burnt down in the 1950s, the exact details of how Saturn came to Russia are unknown, but the Red Army transported Saturn, along with an Indian python, to Moscow in July 1946, bringing him to live in the Moscow Zoo. When the alligator arrived there, he instantly became a popular attraction, as there were only two crocodiles at the zoo and no other alligators. His German origins earned him the nickname 'Hitler', but he was later given the name 'Saturn'. When Russian tanks were moving down the Garden Ring during the 1993 constitutional crisis, Saturn cried out because of the vibrations, which a zookeeper thought reminded him of the Battle of Berlin. In the 1950s, the United States gave the Soviet Union a younger, female alligator as a gift. She was named Shipka, and she and Saturn began mating, but they did not produce any offspring as all of Shipka‚Äôs eggs were infertile. Shipka, who was thirteen years younger than Saturn, later died, and Saturn was so distressed by her death that he refused food for a time. By 2005, Saturn had a new mate, who was then thirty years old. During his time at the Moscow Zoo, Saturn experienced several narrow escapes from death. In the 1980s, a slab of concrete fell from the aquarium's ceiling into the alligator enclosure, but he was in a protective niche at the time. In 1990, a new aquarium building was built, but Saturn resisted the move, refusing to eat for four months and coming close to death. On another occasion, a drunk zoo visitor threw a boulder on his head to wake him up, after which zoo veterinarians fought to keep him alive for months. Later, a group of tourists threw glass bottles at Saturn, injuring him. After these incidents, the enclosure was made more secure with the addition of a thick glass wall. In the 2010s, Saturn once again stopped eating, this time for nearly a year. Zoo staff took blood samples for analysis, and injected him with vitamins to try to keep him alive. He eventually resumed eating. In his later years, Saturn spent much of his time sleeping. He ate a diet of fish, rabbits, and rats twice a week. Vladimir Kudryavtsev, the head of the Moscow Zoo's reptile department, said that not many visitors knew of Saturn's eventful history. Zoo staff only related Saturn's German origins to groups of visiting schoolchildren. When school groups came, the zookeepers allowed children to stick the end of a broomstick into the enclosure, which was safe because Saturn was generally peaceful. His only violent incident occurred in 1970, when he tried to bite an inexperienced warden who tried to feed him by hand. In 2015, the Moscow Zoo renovated the Terrarium, where the alligator enclosure is located. A new interior and reconstructed enclosure were completed, and Saturn returned to public display. That year, Saturn was also sponsored by French clothing company Lacoste, whose logo is a crocodile. The Moscow Zoo announced that Saturn had died at the age of 83 or 84 on 22 May 2020. Mississippi alligators usually live 30‚Äì50 years in the wild. Saturn may have been the world's oldest alligator, although the title may belong to Muja, a male alligator residing at the Belgrade Zoo who is still alive as of 2020 and is in his 80s. At the time of Saturn's death, it was reported that his corpse was to be stuffed and placed on display at the State Darwin Museum, a biology museum in Moscow.

Unlike spillways, intake towers are intended for the reservoir's regular operation, conveying clean, debris-free water for further use. Construction An intake tower is typically made from reinforced concrete, with foundations laid in the river or lake bed. It has at least one water-collecting opening at the top, and may have additional openings along its height, depending on the purpose: towers for hydroelectric plants typically have only one inlet, while those in water-processing plants have multiple draw-off inlets. Near the bottom of the tower, depending on the dam construction and plant location, a horizontal or slanted outlet conduit takes the water from the tower into the plant. The most convenient location for an intake tower is in the proximity of the processing plant. In artificial lakes, those are typically placed near the dam. Lake bed near the dam also provides sufficient water depth to ensure substantial supply to the towers throughout the year, thus the exposed towers can be regularly seen along the dams. When built near the shore, an intake tower is equipped with a service bridge, used to gain access for maintenance. =Draw-off tower= Draw-off towers are intake towers specialized for drinking water reservoirs.

She was particularly known for her distinctive outsize eyewear, and was considered one of the leading young designers of the 1960s New Wave movement in France. Early life Born Ren√©e Georgette Jeanne M√©zi√®re in Paris on 12 September 1937, and nicknamed Nono, her father Ren√© worked for the French Resistance newspaper Combat. Her mother, Ernestine, died when Ren√©e was 10 years old. In 1957 she married the designer Nguyen Manh Khanh, known for his inflatable furniture. Fashion career =Modelling= Ren√©e decided to become a fashion model after graduating from business school, and subsequently became a fitting model for Crist√≥bal Balenciaga. At this point she assumed the professional name Emmanuelle. She also modelled for Hubert de Givenchy. After four years, she quit modelling in order to pursue a career in fashion design. The hairdresser Vidal Sassoon described the 5 foot 6 Khanh as \\"the epitome of why men loved French girls,\\" with her \\"slim and exotic\\" looks. =Fashion design= In 1962, Khanh and Christiane Bailly launched their first collection under the label Emma Christie, which was retailed through popular Paris boutiques. Khanh rapidly became a leading name in Paris young fashion, and was compared to Mary Quant. Like Quant and the London Mod movement, Khanh was seen as a leading name in the French New Wave movement. In 1963, she was described as knowing exactly what young women wanted, selling her clothing in both Britain and the United States. By 1964, her business fetched $4 million a year, and she was credited with having brought \\"class and status\\" to the French ready-made clothing industry. In 1964, she signed an exclusive contract with the New York City department store Henri Bendel, and also sold clothing through Macy's \\"Little Shop\\" boutiques. Around this time, she launched the London-based hairstylist Vidal Sassoon in Paris by asking him to do the hair for a fashion show in the early 1960s. The models, who wore snugly fitting James Wedge hats, pulled off the hats at the end of the show to demonstrate how Sassoon's signature architectural cuts simply fell back into place, which astonished the French press and established Sassoon as a challenge to world-renowned French hairdressing. She also gave a publicity boost to the Italian fashion house Missoni in 1965, when she and Ottavio Missoni collaborated on a knitwear collection. In addition to Missoni, Khanh also designed collections for similarly youth-oriented labels Krizia and Cacharel. The fashion historian and curator Valerie Steele has described Khanh as part of the 1960s fashion revolution, in which female designers from around the world brought street influences and young, easy-to-wear clothing in as a challenge to the then male-dominated formal world of haute couture. Khanh said she wanted to design clothes that anyone on the street could wear. A contemporary press piece in 1968 ranked Khanh and Bailly alongside Mich√®le Rosier as part of a \\"new race\\" of young designers, described as \\"stylists who work for ready-to-wear.\\" These French ready-to-wear designers were called cr√©ateurs. In 1971, Khanh and the London-based Ossie Clark were the first members of a new fashion group, Cr√©ateurs et Industriels, founded by the manufacturer Didier Grumbach as a means of bringing together innovative ready-to-wear designers from around the world (including Issey Miyake and Thierry Mugler) with manufacturers prepared to promote their originality. The group was eventually absorbed by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture who realised that such original and creative ready-to-wear was more profitable and widely marketable than haute couture, and created its own equivalent group, also supervised by Grumbach, the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de la Couture, du Pr√™t-√†-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr√©ateurs de Mode. She founded her own company in 1971, Emmanuelle Khanh Paris, opened the first boutiques in her own name in 1977, and formed Emmanuelle Khanh International in 1987. The company closed in the late 1990s, and the Khanh brand was sold in 2007 to a Dutch conglomerate. Later life and death Emmanuelle Khanh died at her Paris home of pancreatic cancer on 17 February 2017, aged 79.

Appointed as the governor of Gujarat by Tughluq of Delhi sultanate, he declared independence and founded the Gujarat Sultanate when there was a chaos in Delhi following Timur's invasion. He was disposed by his ambitious son Tatar Khan but he regained shortly the throne when he died. Ancestors During the rule of Muhammad bin Tughluq, his cousin Firuz Shah Tughlaq was once on a hunting expedition in area what is now Kheda district of Gujarat. He lost his way and lost. He reached village Thasra. He was welcome to partake in hospitality by village headmen, two brothers of Tanka Rajput family, Sadhu and Sadharan. After drinking, he revealed his identity as a cousin and successor of the king. The brothers immediately offered their beautiful sister in marriage and he accepted. They accompanied Firuz Shah Tughluq to Delhi along with his sister. They converted to Islam there. Sadhu assumed new name, Samsher Khan while Sadharan assumed Wajih-ul-Mulk. They were disciple of saint Hazrat-Makhdum-Sayyid-i-Jahaniyan- Jahangshi aka Saiyyd Jalaluddin Bukhari. Finally, in 1351, when Firuz Shah Tughlaq ascended the throne, he made Shamsh√≠r Kh√°n and Zafar Kh√°n, the son of Waj√≠h-ul-Mulk, his cup-bearers, and raised them to the rank of nobles. Early life Zafar Khan was a son of Wajih-ul-Mulk. According to a legend, saint Bukhari promised Gujarat to Zafar Khan prophetically in return of food provided to Fakirs at his house. He gave him handful of dates and declared, \\"Thy seed like unto these in number shall rule over Gujarat\\". The number of seeds varied from eleven to thirteen according to various sources. Muhammad Bin Tughluq was on an expedition to intervene in a war but he died at Thatta on bank of Indus river in 1351 from fever induced by a surfeit of fish. As he had no sons, his cousin Firuz Shah Tughluq succeeded. Firuz Shah Tughluq appointed Malik Mufarrah, also known as Farhat-ul-Mulk Rasti Khan governor of Gujarat in 1377. In 1387, Sikandar Khan was sent to replace him, but he was defeated and killed by Farhat-ul-Mulk. Firuz Shah died in 1388 and his grandson, Ghiyas-ud-Din Tughlaq II succeeded but was reign only for five months. He was succeeded by another grandson Abu Bakr Shah but after nine months he was deposed by Firuz Shah's son, Nasir ud din Muhammad Shah III who ruled for three years 1389-1392. Reign =Governor of Gujarat under Tughluqs (1391-1407)= In 1391, Sultan Nasir ud din Muhammad Shah III appointed Zafar Khan, the son of Wajih-ul-Mulk as governor of Gujarat and conferred him the title of Muzaffar Khan. In passing Nagor he was met by a deputation from Cambay, complaining of the tyranny of R√°sti Kh√°n. Consoling them, he proceeded to P√°tan, the seat of government, and then marched against R√°sti Kh√°n. The armies met near the village of Kamboi, a dependency of P√°tan, and Farhat-ul-Mulk R√°sti Kh√°n was slain and his army defeated. To commemorate the victory, Zafar Kh√°n founded a village on the battle-field, which he named J√≠tpur (the city of victory), and then, starting for Cambay, redressed the grievances of the people. It was rumoured that Farhat-ul-Mulk was trying to establish independent rule in Gujarat. In 1392, Farhat-ul-Mulk was defeated and killed in the battle of Kambor (now Gambhu), near Anhilwada Patan and occupied the city of Anhilwada Patan. He founded Jitpur at the site of victory.Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 155-7 On the death of Nasir ud din Muhammad Shah III in 1392, his son Sikandar assumed the throne but he died just after 45 days. He was succeeded by his brother Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq II but his cousin Nusrat Khan also claimed similar rank in Firuzabad. Zafar Kh√°n‚Äôs first warlike expedition was against the Rao of Idar, who, in 1393, had refused to pay the customary tribute, and this chief he humbled. The contemporary histories seem to show that the previous governors had recovered tribute from all or most of the chiefs of Gujar√°t except from the R√°o of Junagadh and the R√°ja of Rajpipla, who had retained their independence. Zafar Kh√°n now planned an expedition against the celebrated Somnath temple, but, hearing that √Ådil Kh√°n of √Ås√≠r-Burh√°npur had invaded Sult√°npur and Nandurbar, he moved his troops in that direction, and √Ådil Kh√°n retired to √Åsir. In 1394, he marched against the R√°o of Jun√°ga·∏çh and exacted tribute. Afterwards, proceeding to Somnath, he destroyed the temple, built an Jumma Mosque, introduced Isl√°m, left Muslim law officers, and established a th√°na or post in the city of Somn√°th P√°tan or Deva P√°tan. He heard that the Hindus of Mandu were oppressing the Muslims, and, accordingly, marching there, he beleaguered that fortress for a year, but failing to take it contented himself with accepting the excuses of the R√°ja. From M√°ndu he performed a pilgrimage to Ajmer. Here he proceeded against the chiefs of Sambhar and Dandwana, and then attacking the R√°jputs of Delv√°·∏ça and Jh√°l√°v√°·∏ça, he defeated them, and returned to P√°tan in 1396. About this time his son T√°t√°r Kh√°n, leaving his baggage in the fort of Panipat, made an attempt on Delhi. But Iqb√°l Kh√°n took the fort of P√°nipat, captured T√°t√°r Kh√°n‚Äôs baggage, and forced him to withdraw to Gujar√°t. In 1397, with the view of reducing √çdar, Zafar Kh√°n besieged the fort, laying waste the neighbouring country. In prevailing situation, Timur invaded India and marched on Delhi in 1398. In early 1399, he defeated Mahmud II and looted and destroyed the much of Delhi. Sultan Mahmud II escaped and after many wanderings, reached Patan. He hoped to secure Zafar Khan's alliance to march to Delhi but Zafar Khan declined. He went to Malwa where he was declined again by local governor. Meanwhile his Wazir Iqbal Khan had expelled Nusrat Khan from Delhi so he returned to Delhi but he had no longer enough authority over provinces which were ruled independently by his governors. Before Zafar Khan had taken the Idar fort Zafar Kh√°n received news of Timur‚Äôs conquest of Delhi, and concluding a peace with the √çdar king, returned to P√°tan. In 1398, hearing that the Somn√°th people claimed independence, Zafar Kh√°n led an army against them, defeated them, and established Isl√°m on a firm footing. In 1403, Zafar Khan's son Tatar Khan urged his father to march on Delhi, which he declined. As a result, in 1403, Tatar imprisoned him in Ashawal (future Ahmedabad) and declared himself sultan under the title of Muhammad Shah. He humbled the chief of Nandod in Rajpipla. He marched towards Delhi, but on the way he was poisoned by his uncle, Shams Kh√°n Dand√°ni at Sinor on the north bank of Narmada river. Some sources says he died naturally due to weather or due to his habit of heavy drinking. After the death of Muhammad Shah, Zafar was released from the prison in 1404. Zafar Kh√°n asked his own younger brother Shams Kh√°n Dand√°ni to carry on the government, but he refused. Zafar Kh√°n accordingly sent Shams Kh√°n Dand√°ni to N√°gor in place of Jal√°l Kh√°n Khokhar. Zafar took over the control over administration. In 1407, he declared himself as Sultan Muzaffar Shah at Birpur or Sherpur, took the insignia of royalty and issued coins in his name. =Gujarat Sultanate (1407-1411)= At this time √Ålp Kh√°n, son of Dil√°war Kh√°n of M√°lwa, was rumoured to have poisoned his father and ascended the throne with the title of Sult√°n Hushang Ghori. On hearing this Muzaffar Sh√°h marched against Hushang and besieged him in Dh√°r.He had successful expedition against Dhar (Malwa) which came under his control. Muzaffar handed Hushang to the charge of his brother Shams Kh√°n, on whom he conferred the title of Nasrat Kh√°n. Hushang remained a year in confinement, and M√∫sa Kh√°n one of his relations usurped his authority. On hearing this, Hushang begged to be released, and Muzaffar Sh√°h not only agreed to his prayer, but sent his grandson √Åhmed Kh√°n (later Ahmad Shah I) with an army to reinstate him. This expedition was successful; the fortress of M√°ndu was taken and the usurper M√∫sa Kh√°n was put to flight. √Åhmed Kh√°n returned to Gujar√°t in 1409‚Äì10 AD. Meanwhile Muzaffar advancing towards Delhi to aid Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, prevented an intended attack on that city by Sult√°n Ibr√°h√≠m of Jaunpur. He had suppressed a rebellion or sent an unsuccessful expedition to Kanthkot in Kutch. According to Mirat-i-Ahmadi, he abdicated the throne in favour of his grandson Ahmad Shah I in 1410 due to his failing health. He died five months and 13 days later. According to Mirat-i-Sikandari, Ahmad Shah was going to an expedition to quell the rebellion of Kolis of Ashawal. After leaving Patan, he convened an assembly of Ulemas and asked a question that should he took retribution his father's unjust death. Ulemas replied in favour and he got the written answers. He returned to Patan and forced his grandfather Muzaffar Shah to drink poison which killed him. He was buried in Patan. Ahmad Shah I succeeded him at the age of 19 in 1411.

The series is a production by French company L√©gende Entreprises for Canal+ and Netflix. OCS is airing the show in France and Netflix is streaming the show internationally outside France. The six-episode miniseries, released on September 6, 2019, on Netflix, was said to have been inspired by real-life events. It is based on the book L'espion qui venait d'Isra√´l (English: The Spy Who Came From Israel), written by Uri Dan and Yeshayahu Ben Porat. The series has received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic, with Baron Cohen's performance being praised. However, the series has been criticized for lapses in historical accuracy. There is no independent verification about whom Cohen met with in the Syrian elite while working undercover in Buenos Aires or Damascus.AbuKhalil, As'ad (September 24, 2019). Netflix‚Äôs Mossad Propaganda. Consortium News. Retrieved October 1, 2019. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, Baron Cohen received a nomination for Best Actor ‚Äì Miniseries or Television Film.  Plot  The real-life Eli Cohen The miniseries follows the exploits of Eli Cohen, a Mossad spy. The story takes place during the years leading to the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and Syria. It follows Cohen's past in Egypt as an army reject, to his infiltration of the Syrian Ministry of Defense. He assumes the identity of Kamel Amin Thaabet and establishes himself in Syrian high society. After having befriended people who would eventually take over Syria, Cohen is appointed as the country's Deputy Defense Minister and becomes a close confidant to the future president Amin al-Hafiz. Cast * Sacha Baron Cohen as Eli Cohen / Kamel Amin Thaabet * Hadar Ratzon-Rotem as Nadia Cohen, Eli's wife * Yael Eitan as Maya * Noah Emmerich as Dan Peleg * Nassim Si Ahmed as Ma'azi Zaher al-Din * Moni Moshonov as Jacob Shimoni * Alona Tal as Julia Schneider * Mourad Zaoui as Benny * Alexander Siddig as Ahmed Suidani * Marc Maurille as IDF sergeant * Waleed Zuaiter as Colonel Amin al-Hafiz * Ari√© Elmaleh as Michel Aflaq * Hassam Ghancy as Colonel Salim Hatum * Uri Gavriel as sheikh Majid al-Ard * Tim Seyfi as Mohammed bin Laden Episodes Production The show was filmed in Morocco, Hungary, and the UK. Filming was said to not be possible in Syria due to the Syrian Civil War. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an 86% approval rating based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 6.97/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Though at times stodgy, The Spy exploration of a real-life hero remains engaging thanks to a moving performance from Sacha Baron Cohen.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Nick Allen of rogerebert.com gave the series 3 out of 4 thumbs up, largely praising the excitement the series builds and that it adds a new dimension to the spy genre. Allen writes, \\"...by the end of episode one, ‚ÄúThe Spy‚Äù takes off as Eli transforms into Kamel while delivering a monologue to the camera‚ÄîKamel's life story‚Äîand the series casts a spell, showing a chameleonic actor playing a chameleonic character.\\" Sacha Baron Cohen's performance has been well received. Rolling Stones Alan Sepinwall writes, \\"But Baron Cohen couldn‚Äôt have found a role more well suited to his gifts and career to date. The Spy is a thriller played entirely straight, but it also feels like Baron Cohen‚Äôs persona with vastly higher stakes.\\" Analysts have noted questions of historical accuracy of some of the events presented, as is the case with most historical dramas. According to former Syrian President Amin al-Hafiz, he never met Cohen in Argentina, much less befriended him, and the office of \\"Deputy Defense Minister\\" did not even exist in Syria at the time. The position of Chief Advisor to the defense minister did exist ‚Äì a position in which Cohen claimed to have served.

Randall Kay Williams (17 July 1846 ‚Äì 14 November 1898) was a Victorian showman noted for popularising moving pictures on British fairgrounds. The first known reference to Williams exhibiting films in his show was at Rotherham Statute Fair on 2 November 1896. Williams toured Britain for 25 years, first with a ghost illusion show, and then with a bioscope. He reached the height of his career in the summer of 1897 when he exhibited at the Victorian Era Exhibition in Earl's Court, London. His show that year was designed specifically to pay homage to Queen Victoria's sixty year reign with a programme that included an \\"original Pepper's Ghost\\" performance, ‚Äòanimated photographs‚Äô of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Procession (filmed 22 June 1897), and a Tableau vivant presentation representing the Queen surrounded by the flags of all nations.\\"Professor Pepper‚Äôs Ghost\\", Theatre Notebook, Vol. 43, no. 1, pp. 23-24 Williams was also an outspoken advocate for the travelling show community and a founding member of the United Kingdom Van Dwellers‚Äô Protection Association, the fairground trade organization which evolved into what is known today as the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain.  Early life  Randall Williams was born in Liverpool on 17 July 1846. His father, Thomas, came from an extended family of travelling showmen with roots in Warrington. The Williams family toured with amusements from the mid 1840s until the early 1900s. Their various interests included mechanical exhibitions, waxworks exhibits, photography booths, ghost shows, and cinematograph exhibitions.  Ghost illusion show  Williams' primary interest was the ghost illusion show he started in 1871. A ghost illusion show was a type of stage show that combined theatrical presentations with the optical technique known as Pepper's Ghost. Ghost illusions were popular in British theatres throughout the 1860s but did not appear in fairground shows until the early 1870s. The travelling show‚Äôs adaptation of Pepper‚Äôs Ghost was typically a short stage play, consisting of three acts and a comic song - all done in about twenty minutes. The final act usually ended with a ‚Äòtransformation scene' depicting the final passage from this life to the next, and during which, at least one ghostly entity made its appearance. The ‚Äòghost,‚Äô a life-like, three dimensional and free moving apparition was the reflection of a living being (an actor) who was brightly lit up by limelight, and positioned off stage, out of sight of the audience‚Äôs view. Pepper's Ghost stage set up Putting on the ‚Äòghost‚Äô was a rather costly undertaking for travelling show proprietors. The essential requirements were a source of lighting (limelight), a large mirror, and a large sheet of plate glass upon which to reflect the images. The glass had to be erected so that it sat at a forty-five degree angle at the front of the stage and, it had to be housed in a box specially built for transport. The final component was a platform-type stage built high enough to accommodate the actors (the ghosts) who worked directly below and to the front of the stage, as well as the limelight worker, whose job it was to illuminate the actors whose images were reflected onto and through the glass. An enclosure or partition was erected around the front of the stage to prevent the audience from seeing all the activity that was going on below the surface. The programs for Williams' show varied, but audiences were usually treated to at least one melodrama and a comical farce or two. His show at the New Year‚Äôs fair in Bolton, Lancashire in 1873 advertised a program of ‚Äúa specially written adaptation of the late Chas. Dickens‚Äôs Christmas story of the Haunted Man;‚Äù ‚ÄúGounod‚Äôs famous Opera of Faust and Marguerite;‚Äù ‚Äúthe tableaux illustrative of the heart-stirring poem of Little Jim, the Collier‚Äôs Child;‚Äù ‚Äúthe thrilling legend of Adrian, the Avenger;‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Goblin‚Äôs Haunt, introducing the Gorgeous Transformation Scene;‚Äù ‚Äúthe Seraph or Living Head;‚Äù and other ‚ÄúEntertainment of Prestidigitation.‚ÄùBolton Evening News, 2 January 1873, p. 2 Williams' show was part ghost illusion theatre and part variety show. The artists he employed included actors, song and dance teams, magicians, ballet dancers, mummers and comedians like the Great Little Titch. He also hired international acts such as The Brothers LaFayette (American tight rope walkers) and Professor Howard (an American illusionist). By the early 1880s, Williams' show had many of the same trappings as a theatrical touring company. The show‚Äôs crew in Manchester at the time of the 1881 census consisted of a number of actors, actresses, comedians, musicians and comic singers, as well as a set decorator and a dramatic author. Williams' phantasmagoria was popular with fair-going audiences. A reporter who attended the show at Glasgow Fair in July 1880 wrote that, \\"Not the least amusing show on the ground is Randall Williams' \\"Hobgoblinscope,\\" in which ghosts, phantoms, and goblins appear and disappear, and sing and dance in such a way as to puzzle the auditors to distinguish between illusion, and bodily impersonation.\\"Glasgow Evening Citizen, 14 July 1880, p. 3 Ghost illusions were the mainstay of Williams' show for a quarter of a century with the 'ghosts' making their final appearance at Nottingham Goose Fair in October 1897. The show travelled under various names over the years including The Great Hobgoblinscope (1872 - 1885); The Great Ghost Show (1881 - 1895); and Randall Williams Grand Electroscope and Mammoth Phantoscopical Exhibition (1896-1897). = Ghost show presentations = *The Haunted Man: Bolton New Year's Fair 1873 *Adrien the Avenger: Bolton New Year's Fair 1873 *Goblin's Haunt: Bolton New Year's Fair 1873 *Faust, or The Devil and The Doctor (in 3 acts) or Faust and Marguerite: Bolton New Year's Fair 1873; York Martinmas Fair 1880; Sowerby Rushbearing Festival 1886; Bingley Hall, Birmingham, 1886-87'World‚Äôs Fair at Bingley Hall', Birmingham Daily Post, 25 December 1886, p. 3 *The Aerial Phenomenon: Pembroke Hall, Liverpool, Christmas 1874Era, 20 December 1874, p. 6 *Chawbacon's Troubles: Pembroke Hall, Liverpool, Christmas 1874 *The Misanthrope: Pembroke Hall, Liverpool, Christmas 1874 *Death of Little Jim or Little Jim, The Collier\`s Dying Child (based on the poem by Edward Farmer): Pembroke Hall, Liverpool 1874; Sowerby Rushbearing Festival 1886. *Crackskull Abbey (a spoof on the antics of real- life fraudster, Arthur Orton, who masqueraded as the missing heir, Sir Roger Tichborne): Hull Fair 1874\\"A Visit to Hull Fair\\", Hull Packet & East Riding Times, 16 October 1874, p. 6 *Little Jen, the light of the collier's homestead: Halifax Fair, 1877 Bradford Daily Telegraph, 28 June 1877, p. 4 *Pilots Grave: Peterhead, Scotland 1881East Aberdeenshire Observer, 23 September 1881 *Paddy Mile's Boy, or Ghost at the Wake: Peterhead 1881 *The Dying Fisherman‚Äôs Child: Peterhead 1881 *Corsican Brothers: Bolton, 1883 Bolton Evening News, 31 December 1883, p. 3 *Maria Martin; or the Murder in the Red Barn: Bolton, 1883 *Demon of the Alps: Bolton, 1883 *Ten Nights in a Bar Room: Bolton, 1883 *Mistletoe Bough: Chesterfield, 1884Derbyshire Courier, 6 December 1884, p5 *Fall of Khartoum (a melodrama depicting the death of General Charles Gordon at the Battle of Khartoum in late January 1885): Aston Fair 1885Aston Chronicle, 30 May 1885 *The Bells, \\"as played by Henry Irving\\" (The Bells was a three-act play by Leopold Davis Lewis.

In fact, the speed at which the cinema took off in Britain was due, in large part, to the combined network of exhibitors (travelling showmen) and performance venues (the fairs and fairgrounds) that was already in place.Royal Agricultural Hall, Islington, London Randall Williams was one of the first showmen to exhibit films on the fairgrounds. The first known reference to a cinematograph exhibition in his show was at Rotherham Statute Fair on 2 November 1896.\\"Provincial Theatres\\", Era, 7 November 1896, p. 25 The following month, he was the first showman to exhibit films at the World‚Äôs Fair, an indoor fair held each year over the Christmas holiday period at the Royal Agricultural Hall in London.Era, 26 December 1896, p. 18 Williams' next stop after the World‚Äôs Fair was the Valentine's Fair at King's Lynn, Norfolk in February 1897, where it was reported that the \\"Randall Williams‚Äô Cinematographe Pavilion did immense business.\\" = Haydon and Urry, Ltd. = There is no record of the supplier of the projector used by Williams in the latter months of 1896, but by early February 1897, he was using one supplied by Haydon and Urry, Ltd., a London firm that produced cinematographs and films during the late 1890s. The company's involvement in the cinema trade was short-lived, but they are noted for supplying many of the first fairground film exhibitors. Williams was the first showmen to use Haydon and Urry's projector (The Eragraph)and his use of their machine came about as a result of three contributing factors: - need, availability, and timing. In early 1897, Haydon and Urry were in the process of developing their own film projector. The company had recently moved their offices and showroom to 353 Upper Street, Islington Era, 19 December 1896, p. 28 locating them just across the street from the Royal Agricultural Hall where Williams was exhibiting. Williams was already acquainted with one of the firm‚Äôs employees, James Monte (their chief film maker and manager of their cinematographic department), having met him a year earlier at a showman‚Äôs annual supper committee meeting.Era, 12 January 1895, p. 22Monte testified for Haydon and Urry after two men were charged for breaking into the firm‚Äôs premises and stealing films and cinematographic equipment in February 1898. An article in the Bury and Norwich Post on March 8, 1898 (p. 6) noted that George Haydon and ‚Äúthe manager of the cinematograph department‚Äù (presumably Monte) had caught the two men trying to sell some of the stolen items. The indictment on April 5, 1898 indicated that the witnesses for Haydon and Urry were George Haydon, James Monte, and George Monte (James‚Äôs younger brother). (London County Sessions: Court in Session: General Sessions Roll: London Metropolitan Archives, LJ/SR/199: 5 April 1898: indictment no. 75) By early February 1897, Haydon and Urry‚Äôs projector was ready for market and according to accounts from that time, Williams was in need of a new one. He had opened at the World‚Äôs Fair with an exhibition of films, but the projector he was using (\\"the Electroscope\\") had been condemned as a fire risk by London County officials.Film historian Geoff Mellor‚Äôs original notes of an interview with Randall Williams‚Äô grandson, Paul Williams, at The Living Wagon, Undercliffe Cricket Ground Car Park, Intake Road, Bradford, Yorkshire on March 3, 1984 (notes initialed ‚ÄúGJM‚Äù) Getting a showman as well known as Randall Williams on board with their new projector was a major coup for Haydon and Urry. The firm applied for a patent (application no. 3572) for their cinematograph on 10 February 1897Barnes, J. Beginning of the Cinema in England, Vol. 2, 1897, p. 66 - just as Williams' time at the World‚Äôs Fair was coming to an end - and just five days prior to his show opening at King‚Äôs Lynn at the start of the fairground season.The Showman World\\", Era, 27 February 1897, p20 The projector used by Williams at King's Lynn would have been the firm‚Äôs earliest model and, it was likely the same model he used throughout the summer, leading Haydon and Urry to claim in their advertising that their machine had been used ‚Äúwith unqualified success at Victorian Era Exhibition all Last Season.‚Äù Era, 26 February 1898, p. 27 Williams was Haydon and Urry‚Äôs best known exhibitor, but their Eragraph projector was popular with numerous other early film show proprietors including Harry Scard (of Wadbrook and Scard fame); Albert and George Biddall; Alfred Reynold (Reynold‚Äôs Waxworks Exhibition, Liverpool); John Cooper; George Aspland; Charles Thurston; George Lewis; James Crighton; James Norman; George Williams; Walter Lear (Lears‚Äô Pierrot Minstrels); M. de Montel; Signor Ernest Polverini; Hamilton Brothers (diorama exhibition); John Sylvester (Sylvester‚Äôs Circus); and Mr. C. A. James (World‚Äôs Fair Wax-works, Dublin).  Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee procession  Williams' main draw in 1897 were films supplied by Haydon and Urry of Queen Victoria's Jubilee Procession on 22 June 1897. The company opened its own film production studio in April 1897Era, 1 May 1897, p. 29 and the Jubilee films (a series of six films) were produced by James and Richard Monte, two brothers employed by the firm. The films were exhibited at the London Pavilion the same night they were filmed and are believed to have been the first footage of the procession to be seen by the public.Barnes, J. Beginning of the Cinema in England, Vol. 2, pp. 67-68 A second copy of the films was dispatched by train to Liverpool where they were exhibited by the owners of Reynolds Waxworks and Variety Exhibition on Lime Street within 24 hours of the procession having taken place.Liverpool Mercury, 26 June 1897, p. 7\\"Filming the Diamond Jubilee: A Popular Exhibit,\\" Times, 9 April 1935, p. 19 Other films produced for Haydon & Urry by the Monte brothers included scenes of Henley Regatta, Lady Overboard, Turn out of Fire Brigade, The Bride's First Night, Twelve Months After, and the funeral procession of actor William Terriss. = Films exhibited in Williams' Show = *Queen of the Antipodes: World‚Äôs Fair, Royal Agricultural Hall, London, December 1896Islington Gazette, 29 December 1896 *Fishery Exhibition: World‚Äôs Fair, London, December 1896 *The Czar in Paris: King‚Äôs Lynn, February 1897Lynn Advertiser, in The Picture House in East Anglia, p. 17 * Serpentine Dance: King's Lynn, February 1897 *A Paris boulevard: King‚Äôs Lynn, February 1897 *A march past of the Royal blues: King‚Äôs Lynn, February 1897 *Queen Victoria‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee Procession: Victorian Era Exhibition, London, June 1897: Nottingham Goose Fair 1897Victorian Nottingham, Vol. 3, p. 49 *Graeco-Turkish War film (a fake war film): Nottingham Goose Fair 1897Journals of Sydney Race, p. 83 *Mdme Loie Fuller in a most beautiful Serpentine dance: Hull Fair 1897Hull Daily Mail, 11 October 1897, p. 3 *Village Blacksmith: Hull Fair 1897 *The teetotaller that got drunk - roars of laughter: Hull Fair 1897 *The old gardener - very humerous [sic]: Hull Fair 1897 *Express training coming into a local station, people getting in and out of the train: Hull Fair 1897 *Prize fight between Fitzsimmons & Corbett (likely Haydon & Urry‚Äôs The Great Fight ‚Äì Knockout): Hull Fair 1897 *A young lady taking a morning bath (likely Haydon & Urry's Impromptu Bath): Hull Fair 1897 *Wrestling Match for Championship of the World: Hull Fair 1897 *On the benches in the park: Hull Fair, October 1897 *The unfaithful wife: Hull Fair, October 1897 *Bathing at Blackpool: Hull Fair, October 1897 *Sea at Storm: Hull Fair, October 1897 *The Queen‚Äôs carriage near St. Paul‚Äôs, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge, Foreign Princes, Colonial Premiers, &c.;: Hull Fair, 1897 *Local Animated Subjects: Malton Hiring Fair, 1897Hebden Times, 13 November 1897 *Funeral of William Terriss (filmed by Haydon & Urry): World‚Äôs Fair, London, 1897Era, 29 January 1898, p. 20 *Snowballing Match: World‚Äôs Fair, London, 1897 *A film depicting the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War: Manningham Feast, Yorkshire, August 1898Leeds Mercury, 3 August 1898, p. 6 *Gladstone‚Äôs Funeral: London, June 1898Stage, 2 June 1898, p. 21 *Dr. Grace‚Äôs Jubilee Day at Lords: Nottingham Goose Fair 1898Journals of Sydney Race, p. 86  The Van Dweller's Protection Association  Williams was one of the travelling show community‚Äôs more outspoken advocates. He organized several protests over the years against the railway companies over the rates they were charging travelling amusement caterers. He was also one of a small group of showmen who met at the Black Lion Hotel in Salford in late 1890 to organize a protest against the Moveable Dwellings Bill. The proposed bill had been initiated by child welfare reformer, George Smith, and was described as ‚Äúproviding for the regulation of vans, vehicles and tents used as dwellings.‚Äù It‚Äôs real intent, however, was to enact legislation aimed at regulating and controlling the gypsy population and forcing itinerant parents to send their children to school. There were some commendable aspects to the bill, but the showmen believed that if the bill passed, it would restrict their ability to travel and pose a serious threat to their livelihoods. The showmen‚Äôs dispute with George Smith over the bill lasted another three years. Smith‚Äôs final attempt to regulate the itinerant population was a revised bill in 1894 for the ‚Äúimprovement of moveable dwellings,‚Äù but little became of it and Smith died less than a year later. The showmen‚Äôs opposition to the bill, however, left a lasting legacy. It helped shape a new alliance between the men and women who made a living with traveling amusements and led to them forming the United Kingdom Van Dwellers‚Äô Protection Association at a meeting in Lord George Sanger's Amphitheatre in London on 12 February 1891.\\"Van-Dwellers in Conclave. A Showmen's Association,\\" Stage, 19 February 1891, p 14 The new van dwellers association was the start of a new trade organization and it helped define those in the travelling amusement trade as a distinct group, socially and economically separate from other groups of travellers. The Van Dweller‚Äôs Protection Association was renamed the Showmen‚Äôs Guild in 1900 and is known today as the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain. Williams was deeply involved in the Van Dweller‚Äôs Protection Association, both as a committee member and as one of the Vice Presidents for the Manchester Section.  Death and legacy  Randall Williams Cinematograph Show, 1902 Williams' last show was at Freeman Street Market in Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, where he died of typhoid fever on 14 November 1898. He was buried at Weaste Cemetery in Salford on 18 November with the funeral service being conducted by the Reverend Thomas Horne. Williams was survived by his long-term partner, Annie Radford Williams, daughters, Caroline and Annie, and sons, Randall, Thomas, Eddie Albert, and George. He was predeceased by his first wife, Mary Ann Hough, who died in 1884. Following his death, Williams' main bioscope was taken over by his daughter Carrie and new husband, Dick Monte (former Haydon and Urry employee). They continued to travel the show as the Randall Williams Cinematograph Show until 1913 when it was destroyed by fire at Thirsk, Yorkshire. Williams' No. 2 show was taken over by his daughter and son-in-law, Annie and Reuben Williams. They travelled with their bioscope until 1906.  References  ;Footnotes ;Sources *Acton, T.A.

He is known for performing with his band Buswell, and for completing musical challenges with Erik Nyberg, sometimes for charity, and often involving strangers. Early life Buswell was born in Swindon, England. Music He began his career as a solo artist, Buswell, in 1999. By 2006, this had grown into a 5 piece group featuring James Adkin, Matt Musella, Rebecca Bates and Rachael Birkin and the band's debut single \\"Let Me Love\\" was featured on MTV's \\"This is Americana\\" & VH1, as well as getting to No. 1 and No. 2 in Amazon's Pre-release & Hot 100 CD Singles Chart respectively.. Since then, Buswell has performed with multiple musicians and often performs with a line-up in double figures. Music challenges Buswell started work on what he would call \\"musical challenges\\", often for various charities, where he would attempt seemingly difficult musical tasks, often including him writing and arranging the music without being able to read a single note. Despite being unable to read music, Buswell uses the music softwares Sibelius & Cubase to assist him with arranging the music. =Royal Wootton Bassett Orchestra Challenge= In 2011, Buswell's first challenge was to compose and write music for the Royal Wootton Bassett Orchestra and perform a one-off show in Swindon in aid of UK based charity Kick 4 Life. =121212 Underground Orchestra Challenge= In 2012, Buswell attempted a year-long challenge, where he had to form an orchestra from strangers he met while travelling as passengers on the London Underground, for Daytrippers, a charity supporting disabled and terminally ill children and young people throughout the UK. The challenge was called the 121212 challenge as he had until 12 December 2012 to complete the task. Halfway through the year, to promote the challenge, and to raise funds for UK charity Music Alive, Buswell formed a small group from musicians he had met so far, and performed on the London Eye. After 12 months, Buswell had approached over 300 strangers carrying musical instruments and formed a 68-piece orchestra. He then performed a one-off show at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire, again performing music he scored without being able to read it, as well as a medley of movie themes from films featuring the London Underground. =SN1 Fest Challenge= In 2013, Buswell reformed 30 musicians from the 121212 Orchestra to take part in the Live and Cultured portion of the SN1 Fest Summer Ball at the Town Gardens, Swindon. The challenge this time was to score original accompaniments for songs by local acts of varying genres, and get the orchestra to perform with them. The orchestra performed with punk band 2 Sick Monkeys, indie-folk band Old Colours, alt-rock band British Harlem and hip-hop act AJ Live. The orchestra also performed a rendition of Arctic Monkeys' \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" with Radio 1's Huw Stephens. =Edinburgh Fringe Orchestra Challenge= In 2014, he set himself the task of forming an orchestra from strangers he bumped into at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 10 days. As with previous challenges, he composed the music without being able to read it, using composing software Sibelius. After 10 days, he had formed a 24-piece orchestra, who performed a one-off show at The Jam House as part of the Edinburgh Free Fringe. =Geronimo Busking Challenge= In January 2015, Buswell was asked by Decca Records to create a music video for Sheppard's \\"Geronimo\\" from random buskers and musicians he met on the streets of London. He spent five days travelling around and recorded 12 musicians to create a multi-screen video. =Pilton Pop-up Orchestra 2015= In 2015, Buswell formed The Pilton Pop-up Orchestra at Glastonbury Festival, made up of people who were attending the festival. They performed on a number of stages during the weekend, including the Glade Stage. Special guests also joined the orchestra to perform a rendition of one of their songs, including Nick Harper, Ellie Rose and The Cadbury Sisters. =10-Day Orchestra Challenge 2015= In November 2015, supported by Arts Council England through a Grants for the Arts Award, Buswell worked with Swedish musician Erik Nyberg (from Last Box of Sparklers) to create 10 pop-up orchestras in 10 days around the UK, with the aim of playing with 100 different musicians. Buswell was not allowed to personally discuss payment with any musician he met, nor could he hire musicians through advertisements. Instead, he had to find each musician personally and they had to live within a 50-mile radius of the venue. The pair travelled around the UK, eventually forming 10 orchestras that totalled 101 musicians. =10-Day Orchestra Challenge 2016= In June 2016, again supported by Arts Council England through a Grants for the Arts Award, Buswell and Nyberg set out around the UK in an attempt to better their record of 101 musicians from 2015. This time, they set a target of 150 musicians. In 10 days, they managed to form 10 pop-up orchestras from 143 musicians. =Paris Orchestra Challenge 2017= In April 2017, Buswell and Nyberg completed their Paris Orchestra Challenge, where from 1‚Äì9 April they formed a 27-piece orchestra from strangers they met in Paris, wrote and arranged an album of music with the group, and then recorded 12 songs in 6 hours for a live studio album in Ferber Studios. =Siberian Orchestra Challenge 2018= In July 2018, Buswell and Nyberg travelled to Buryatia in Siberia and in one week, formed an orchestra of at least 25 musicians, writing and collaborating on a selection of music that was performed at the \\"Voice of Nomads\\" international music festival. =Pilton Pop-up Orchestra 2019= In 2019, Buswell created another Pilton Pop-up Orchestra at Glastonbury Festival, made up of performers and people who were attending the festival. 17 musicians performed, including Charlie Draper on Theremin. Special guests also joined the orchestra to perform a rendition of one of their songs, including Frank Turner. GPS penis art Whilst touring the UK as part of 2016's 10-Day Orchestra Challenge, Buswell noticed it would be possible to reroute the travels to draw a giant penis across England and Scotland in GPS drawing. Using GPS tracking that users could log into and watch, the drawing was created in real time, and Buswell and Nyberg drew a 400+ mile penis during their tour.

School history  Whampoa Secondary School was established in 1961 at St. Wilfred Road as a Chinese middle school. The school was named after Mr. Whampoa Hoo Ah Kay, a pioneer merchant who also served as the first Chinese member of the Singapore Legislative Council in 1867. The school was recognised for their values-driven education and discipline. In 1978, Whampoa Secondary School (Chinese) was initially included in the list of newly established Special Assistance Plan Schools. However, with the concern from the Ministry of Education over the quality of students admitted, the number of SAP schools were amended to nine, which excluded Whampoa Secondary School (Chinese). The school was converted to an integrated school, and renamed Whampoa Secondary School in the 1980s, to enrol students from the English Language streams due to falling enrolment (and declining popularity of Chinese schools). The school was eventually closed in 1994 with insufficient cohort size.

The theatre had been one of the main entertainment places in Geylang from 1930 to 1982. The building was named Wembley Cinema from 1930 to 1933, Ritz Cinema from 1933 to 1939, and Queen‚Äôs Theatre from 1939 until it was closed in 1982. The front facade of the building is now conserved and becomes part of the GrandLink Square.  History  1930: The Wembley Cinema was open as a suburban theatre in Geylang. The announcement of open show was published on Malaya Tribune, a local press. The cinema was equipped with Western Electric apparatus to offer patrons as good voice reproduction and synchronization. There would be two changes of program weekly, and two shows nightly at 6.15 pm and 9.15 pm. A matinee would be shown on Sunday at 3 pm when children were admitted at half price. 1930-1933: Many popular films were shown there, like the American musical operetta film ‚ÄúThe Vagabond King‚Äù and the British crime film ‚ÄúDeadlock‚Äù. The films shown in Wembley Cinema were ranging from Europe and America, to Malaysia and local. The cinema was so popular in 1930 and 1931 that it had developed into a main place of entertainment in Geylang, shown from 219 articles and advertisements on newspapers like Malaya Tribune and The Straits Times. 1933: In 1933, Ritz Cinema, which was also located at Geylang, moved into Wembley hall. The consolidation of the two suburban cinemas in Geylang brought more people to the building, whose name was officially changed to Ritz Cinema. old map of the location of the Queen's Theater 1933-1938: Films like ‚ÄúSaramang‚Äù, an American pro-code action film, and Charlie Chaplin‚Äôs epic comedy film ‚ÄúModern Times‚Äù were well received. An Egyptian talkie entitled ‚ÄúLong Live Love‚Äù was re- screened due to the fact that Abdul Wahab, whose singing and acting have delighted local Muslim cinema-fans was featured in the principal role. The price was sometimes halved to attract more people. the photo of the Queen's Theatre before it was closed 1939: Malaya Tribunes announced that the Ritz Cinema was closed due to reconstruction, and the name was changed to Queen‚Äôs Theatre. New car park was added for the Queen‚Äôs Theatre after the renovation. 1939-1941: Queen‚Äôs Theatre continued providing good quality films, like the Malay Film ‚ÄúHarta Berdarah‚Äù, to residents in Geylang 1941-1945: During World War II, the movies were banned. The Queen‚Äôs Theatre was converted to stage Bangsawan shows with a generous dose of singing. Bangsawan is a type of traditional Malay opera performed by a troupe. Stories were given by the Japanese or passed by the Japanese military police before actual stage. If the Japanese were pleased with the performance, the troupes would receive more rice rations. Anti-British stories were warmly received. 1946-1948: After World War II, the Queen‚Äôs Theatre was back to movie industry with films like ‚ÄúIsle of Forgotten Shas‚Äù. 1949: The Shaw Organization showed interest in acquiring the theatre and indeed turned it into its property. 1951-1952: The Queen‚Äôs Theatre was under repair work since 1951, but after two men met their deaths in falls, all work has been suspended. After the death of Chung Seng Kar who slipped and rolled off the sloping roof on to the concrete below on 1951.12.25, the rumors of a spiteful ghost haunting the building roof spread widely. The fact that the theatre was built on the site of an old Malay cemetery and the skeletons were unearthed when the foundations were laid was lending weight to the rumors. Moreover, the police investigators gave evidence that two or three years ago an Arab employee at the theatre had died as a result of a fall through the ceiling. Although it was proved that the accident was because of rain, the rumor affected the repair work of the Queen‚Äôs Theatre. Plans of the traditional kampung house and the Former Queen's Theatre 1980-1982: In earlier 1980s, the movie business kept going down due to the stiff competition from TV and videotapes. The cinema attendance had been dropping steadily from a peak of 46,054,000 in 1979 to a low of 35,781,000 last year. Many closed cinemas like Hoover, was turned into a theatre for ‚Äúlive‚Äù entertainment and musical variety shows. Not only Live theatre operators, church congregations which do not have their own premises were moving in as well, two Shaw cinemas in New World Amusement Park ‚Äì Grand and Pacific were now occupied by a Christian group. Another two churches are believed to be eyeing two more Shaw cinemas, Queen‚Äôs in Geylang and Ciros in Telok Blangah. 1982: The Queen‚Äôs Theatre was closed. 2000: GrandLink Square was built on the site of the Former Queen‚Äôs Theatre whose front facade was kept and become part of the facades of the GrandLink Square. The facade now is under the conservation area of URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority). The GrandLink Square was built by Shin Hwa Cheong Development with 71 apartment units. Architecture based on the plan of the building and description of the interior, this section is deduced as a possible reference By looking at the fa√ßade, it has characters of colonial-style architecture which was popular when Singapore was under the control of Britain. The European architectural style, such as Palladian, Renaissance or Neoclassical style, was usually applied to civic and commercial building by the colonial government. The equilateral triangle at the top of the facade with decorations on the edges and the dome at the entrance structure clearly indicates the colonial fashion in Singapore architecture in 1930s. Moreover, the columns with decoration and lamp at the top by two sides defines the front yard of the theatre. However, when looking at plan of this building, it is a typical Kampong (compound) house which the entrance, or front of the building, is marked by an extruding structure. The building is raised from ground level, in the consideration of possible flood or heavy rain in tropical climate. Deducing from the dimension of the theatre, the building contains one cinema hall with sufficient space for comfortable seats. Linear arrangement of the space gives people comfortable experience in the cinema. The localization of the colonial style in Singapore followed the fashion, and responded to local climate and culture. No doubt that the theatre had been attractive not only because of the programs and facilities, architecture also helps it to gain much popularity.

History Heinzenberg Castle was built on the western side of the Domleschg Valley in the 12th century by the Freiherr von Vaz. In contrast to the small landholdings of other castles in the region, Heinzenberg was the political and judicial center over much of the valley. Though the first mention of the castle was in 1394, by 1380 the name was applied to the river and the entire side of the valley. The castle was the center of the Vaz family's power in the region until the extinction of the line in 1337-38. After the extinction of the Vaz, the castle passed to Count Rudolph IV von Werdenberg-Sargans. His son Johann sold it in 1383 to Ulrich Bran von Rh√§z√ºns. In 1450 there was a dispute over inheritance in the Rh√§z√ºns family, the imperial court at Rottweil assigned Heinzenberg to Ursula von Hohenberg, a member of the Rh√§z√ºns family. The castle was damaged in 1451-52 during fighting in the nearby Schams part of the valley. In 1461 the castle returned to the Werdenberg-Sargans family. In 1475 the Heinzenberg lands, except for the castle, was sold to the Bishop of Chur. In 1482 there was a Werdenberg vogt resident in the castle. After the death of Count Georg von Werdenberg-Sargans in 1504, it was abandoned and fell into ruin. Castle site The castle was built on a narrow, rocky outcropping below the village of Pr√§z, on the slopes above the valley. A ditch protects the relatively flat mountain side of the outcropping. The tower has a pentagon shaped floor plan and today is about three stories tall. Before its partial collapse in 1956 the tower was a total of six stories high. It was crowned with battlements and topped with a wooden roof. A second construction phase added a ring wall around the tower. The west part of the ring wall is still standing. The remains of a southern wall show that a several story tall residence probably stood there.

It is located in the municipal area of Hayingen on the Swabian Alb, about three kilometers north of Zwiefalten. Description The Wimsener H√∂hle or Wimsen Cave is Germany¬¥s only water cave, which can be visited by boat. It is located in Wimsen, part of the municipal area of Hayingen, about three kilometers north of Zwiefalten a small hamlet on the Swabian Alb. Wimsen consists of a mill, a barn, an inn and the Wimsener cave, all of which is privately owned belonging to Ehrenfels Castle. Of the cave¬¥s 1200 meters in length only 70 meters are accessible to a visitor in a boat. About 70 meters behind the entrance the cave ceiling drops down to the water surface, so the rest of the cave can only be explored with diving equipment. The Zwiefalter Aach arises from the cave with an average flow of 590 l/s, a minimum of 60 l/s, and a maximum of 6240 l/s. Water and air temperature in the cave are between 7 and 8 ¬∞C representing the annual mean temperature of the region. History In 1803, Duke Friedrich II, the later King Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg visited the cave, after which the cave was also named \\"Friedrichsh√∂hle\\" in his honor. In 1910, the limestone cave was partly surveyed. It was not until 1959, when divers were able to penetrate a siphon, that further explorations and measurements could be made. From 1961 to 1975, Jochen Hasenmayer, among others, played an important role, as he reached 400 meters far and 40 meters deep into the cave. Geology The Wimsener H√∂hle is located in limestone rocks of the Wei√üjura Formation, which were deposited in the Jurassic ocean some 150 million years ago. The Wimsen cave is estimated to be about one million years old and was created as is typical for a solutional cave by the spring water of the Zwiefalter Aach, which when rainwater absorbed carbonic acid, seeped through the soil layers in the catchment area and penetrated deeply into the white jura.

His militia service under Captain John West saw him earn the title \\"Colonel\\", and a sheriff in both King and Queen (1699-1701) and King William (1701-1702) counties of Virginia. Biography Waller was born in England on January 23, 1673, the fifth child of Dr. John Waller of Newport Pagnell and Mary Pomfrett Waller, who were married on January 13, 1669. He travelled to Virginia at the end of the 17th century. It is known that it was before May 1, 1696 because that is when he purchased 1039 acres of land in the Pamunkey Neck of King and Queen County, on the south side of the Mattaponi River. He established a plantation here which he named \\"Endfield\\", which still exists today as Enfield Sod, Inc. He was a slave owner. He later established another plantation between 1723-1726 at \\"Newport\\" in Spotsylvania County, which he named for his birthplace in England. A key fact in Waller's history, as a slave owner, is that he was the slaveholder who purchased a man named Kunta Kinte after Kinte was kidnap and transported to America in 1767. This history is included in the book Roots by Alex Haley. Haley's book served, in part, as the premise for the groundbreaking 1977 miniseries, as well as the History Channel remake in 2016. Career Col. John Waller was a justice of the peace and the first sheriff of King William County in 1701. A small building that still exists today at Endfield is said to have acted as the county's first jail. He was the first Clerk of the Spotsylvania County in 1722. His son Edmund succeeded him in 1742. In 1747 he was made a Trustee of the city of Fredericksburg. Waller sat in the House of Burgesses as a member for King William County in the session of 1720, which was extended into 1722.\\"Members of the House of Burgesses\\". Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 8.3 (1901): 245-260: 246. Family John Waller married Dorothy King circa 1697. They had six children: Mary, John, Thomas, William, Benjamin, and Edmund. Mary Waller (1699-1781) married Zachary Lewis (1702-1765), and their daughter Ann Lewis married George Wythe, who signed the Declaration of Independence and taught Thomas Jefferson. Benjamin Waller (d. 1786) married Martha Hall, and their daughter Dorothy Elizabeth Waller married Henry Tazewell in 1774.

History The school takes its name after Bakkeg√•rden, a farm that moved out of the village of Vangede as a result of Bernstorff's agricultural reforms in 1766. Its land was divided between S√∏ndre Bakkeg√•rd and Nordre Bakkeg√•rd in 1783. Nordre Bakkeg√•rd was demolished in 1935 to make room for new soccer fields. Tj√∏rneg√•rdsskolen from 1924 had become too small and the municipality therefore planned a new school in the middle of the new neighborhood which was under development at Bakkevejene. The school was designed by the architect Frederik Wagner. The school had an astronomical observatory on the roof and an area with school gardens located to the west of the building. Several classes were transferred from Tj√∏rneg√•rdsskolen and the new school was therefore full to capacity after just a few years. In the 1940s and 1950s, the number of pupils frequently exceeded 800. A school kitchen, library and medical and dental clinics were later added. The number of pupils declined to less than 400 after 1975 but the number began to rise again after Moseg√•rdsskolen was closed. Architecture The school is a Functionalist aula school. It was altered in 2004-2006 to meet modern requirements. A new underground sports hall was constructed under the schoolyard. The size of the school was increased from 6,500 square metres to almost 10,000 square metres. Artworks At the main entrance is a sculpture of a lion. It was created by Henrik Stercke.

She sets puzzles for The Guardian, The Independent (as Anarche), the Financial Times (as Rosa Klebb), the New Statesman (as Aranya), and The Times, and advanced cryptics for The Listener crossword (The Times), Enigmatic Variations (The Daily Telegraph) and the Inquisitor (The Independent). Hayes's clues are often smutty or political and make frequent use of the generic she. Biography Hayes holds an MPhil in Russian and between 1979 and 1997 was a lecturer in Russian studies at the Victoria University of Manchester, where she published A Study of English Nautical Loanwords in the Russian Language of the Eighteenth Century. Hayes's first crossword was published in the Independent Saturday Magazine on 25 May 1996, and after setting some advanced barred grid cryptics for various papers on a freelance basis, she was hired by The Guardian to help set up their beginner-level \\"Quiptic\\" crossword. From there, she got a regular slot in The Guardian and other broadsheets. Hayes also took part in the BBC Radio 4 series David Baddiel Tries to Understand..., setting a beginner's crossword for the show and putting together a guide to solving cryptics. After retiring as a lecturer in 1997, Hayes studied for a diploma in intelligence and international relations. She currently lives in Burnage, Manchester, and for several years ran an online bookshop with her husband Nick. Style Hayes describes herself as an \\"anarcho-horizontalist\\" and her crosswords often reflect her political leanings ‚Äì one of her most often cited clues reads \\"Throw shoe! Bugger invaded Iraq! (6,4)\\", which has the solution GEORGE BUSH (an anagram of \\"shoe bugger\\") and references the Bush shoeing incident. Her other political crosswords have commented on current affairs, such as a puzzle in The Independent during the Leveson inquiry that referenced many of the main players in the case, or drawn attention to injustices: one puzzle included hidden messages \\"JUSTICE NOT DONE\\" and \\"DANIEL MORGAN\\" in the form of ninas as part of a campaign against police corruption, while another included the names of undercover police officers from the Special Demonstration Squad who had deceived protesters into sexual relationships. After her clue \\"Woman in charge of automobile club (6)\\" (DRIVER, a double definition of \\"motorist\\" and \\"golf club\\") proved surprisingly controversial, Hayes has also made a point of including women and the generic she where possible in clues. Arachne puzzles often use sexual innuendo, to the extent that she is sometimes reined back by her editors. Pseudonyms Her Guardian pseudonym, also used in The Listener and other puzzles, is drawn from the mythical Greek weaver Arachne, and references her hobby of amateur weaving. \\"Anarche\\", used in The Independent, is an anagram of \\"Arachne\\" and hints at her political views. \\"Rosa Klebb\\", used in the Financial Times, is taken from the James Bond villain, and references Hayes's background in Russian and her politics ‚Äì the name is itself a pun on the Soviet feminist slogan khleb i rozy. \\"Aranya\\", her pseudonym in the New Statesman, is the Catalan for \\"spider\\".

The so-called Altarpiece of Alella is a design by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud√≠ that is part of the project of the chapel of the Holy Sacrament commissioned in 1883 by the Rector Jaume Puig i Claret for the parish church of Sant Feliu (Saint Felix) in Alella.Bassegoda Nonell. 1989. p. 199. It became known by a drawing preserved in the parochial archive found in 1959, delineated with India ink in two colours and showing Gaud√≠'s signature, published for the first time in the same year.Art√®s, S. and Galera, J. 1959. A reproduction was included the book Gaud√≠ by George R. Collins the following yearCollins. 1960. pp. 14 and 29. which was transcendent for the worldwide diffusion of the work of the architect of Reus as it was the first monograph dedicated to him in English language. The drawing at issue is the cross section of a chapel attached to the church of Sant Feliu. The altar and its altarpiece are placed in the apse of the chapel behind a pointed arc with seven stained glass windows. The altarpiece has a flat panel shape with marked Gothic inspiration, sculptural figures ahead and the main motif representing the crucifixion guarded under a canopy. Neither the altarpiece nor the chapel designed by Gaud√≠ came to be built although the project was approved on by the Bishop of Barcelona, Jaume Catal√† Albosa. Finally the chapel was built according to another project.Web site of the Parroquia de Sant Feliu de Alella. Gaud√≠'s plan was exhibited and reproduced several times. In 1997, on the commission of the Town Hall of Alella, the altar and chapel were reconstructed following Gaud√≠'s design using CAD programs.Project by Joan Bassegoda Nonell, Bibiana Sciortino and Mario Andruet, architects. This work was part of the Gaud√≠ i Alella exhibition at the Centre Cultural Can Lleonard in 1999, including a model of the chapel and the altarpiece.  Description  The parish (Saint Felix) in Alella. The altarpiece is a square table placed over a decorated with pointed arches pedestal with a frieze of medallions representing vegetal and angels figures. In front it is placed the altar with the tabernacle also in ogival form. In the centre is the sculpture of the crucifixion surrounded by an almond-shaped figure from which rays emerge, under a canopy of fine gothic design in the form of a temple rotated 45 degrees, where guardian angels are placed. It tops in a cover with sharp slopes where a slender cross is placed crowning the altarpiece. The great table on which the whole is structured is framed by a delicate guard and is divided into four columns where the word Sanctus is repeated 36 times. In the Gaud√≠'s project the altarpiece was in the apse of the chapel preceded by an arch with seven staggered windows according to the ogival arch with figures of angels in the stained glasses. The chapel was covered with gable roof over wooden joists supported by ribbed pointed arches, a characteristic Catalan Gothic system of diaphragmatic arches and woody beams that can be seen for example in the Royal Chapel of Santa √Ågueda in Barcelona.Bassegoda Nonell. 1989. p. 199.  Symbolism  In a 1983 article on the centenary of this project, Joan Bassegoda Nonell explained its symbolism, based on the Apocalypse of St. John.Bassegoda Nonell. 1983. The seven angels in the windows of the arch are described in Chapter 8, Verse 2: \\"I saw seven angels standing before God, to whom were given seven trumpets.\\" In chapter 4 St. John expressed that he saw four beings -lion, bull, eagle and man- repeating day and night prayer: Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord Almighty, who was, who is and who will come. In each of the four columns of the altarpiece can be read nine times the word Sanctus, equivalent to four times three repetitions of the triple prayer symbolizing this way this passage of the Apocalypse. The central figure of the altar is the crucifixion with Christ in the cross and the Virgin and St. John at both sides composing the so-called Horizontal Trinity or Juanist Trinity. The group stands in front of the almond shaped form where rays of light emanate from the head of the Christ, forming the Elliptical Aura, a symbol of apotheosis and glory.Bassegoda Nonell. 1989. p. 199. Thus the whole assembly of the chapel and the altarpiece formed a direct symbolism of the crucifixion and the interpretation of passages of the Apocalypse of St. John. The invocation of the Sanctus had been used shortly before by Gaud√≠ in the watercolor drawing of a reliquary, preserved in the Reus museum, and the following year he will repeat it in the stained glass windows of the crypt of the Sagrada Familia temple.R√†fols. 1929. p. 115. Bassegoda remarks that the student gate for a cemetery that Gaud√≠ projected in 1875 contained numerous apocalyptic symbols.Bassegoda Nonell. 1989. p. 200.

Gaud√≠ befriended Manuel Vicens Montaner since the commission of the famous Casa Vicens of Barcelona. As a result, he spent many summers of the 1880s in the residence that the Vicens family had in Alella, at the Carrer de Dalt (today Anselm Clav√© street). Gaud√≠ designed two pieces of furniture that remained in this house for many years, while Mr. Vicens' daughter lived there: a wooden and metal corner fireplace currently displayed in the Casa Vicens, with a great sculpture on a slender pedestal. Written on metal plate are shown the initials M.V. of Manuel Vicens. The other piece of furniture is a hanging wooden corner cabinet decorated with gold metal inlays. The interior faces of the doors have shelves to optimize the functionality of the small furniture. It is currently in a private house in Barcelona. This piece of furniture shows the initials D.G., of Dolors Giralt, Mr. Vicens's wife. In the parish church of Alella there is another piece that can be attributed to Gaud√≠. It is the first section of the staircase of the romanesque bell tower, considered the most notable of its style in the coastal area of Catalonia,Bassegoda Nonell. 1989. p. 200. which received a modification in its initial section on the ground floor giving it curved shape with broken triangular floor steps so that each step allows to gain two heights, according to the Gothic system described and illustrated by Viollet-le-Duc that allows stairs with slopes of up to 45 degrees.Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Dictionnaire raisonn√© de l‚Äôarchitecture fran√ßaise du XIe au XVIe si√®cle. √âdition Bance-Morel de 1854 √† 1868. Vol. V. pp. 294-295. Gaud√≠ should be credited with having innovated on this scheme which applied only to straight stairs. By the same dates Gaud√≠ was building a similar staircase in the stables of the Finca G√ºell, which turns very likely to attribute to him the one of the bell tower of Alella. Stairs with the same configuration were projected by Gaud√≠ in the waterfall of the park of the Ciutadella in Barcelona when he collaborated with Joan Fontser√©.Bassegoda Nonell. 1989. p. 111. y> cts. In this case the structure was metallic, while the other two are made of bricks. Finally may be related the wrought iron cross next to the altar of the church of Alella, whose shape is similar to the one that Gaud√≠ drew in the design of the altar of the Crucifixion (in the drawing it is suggested since it is covered by the arch), and attributed to the architect too.Web site of the Parroquia de Sant Feliu de Alella.

His earlier works can be seen as part of the Classical-modernist movement.Ruth Negendanck: Hiddensee, Die besondere Insel f√ºr K√ºnstler. Edition Fischerhuder Kunstbuch, 2005, . p. 34 ff.  Life  Harold Tronson Bengen was born in Hanover, one of his parents' four children, during the early years of the German empire. His father was a pharmacist specialising in animal medicines. His mother, born _ Tronson, was his father's second wife. She was an educator, originally from England, who had met his father while visiting Hanover and married him. Till 1914 Harold Bengen used the name \\"Harold T Bengen\\", with the \\"T\\" standing for Tronson. Harold Bengen attended the Humanities Gymnasium (secondary school) in Hanover, where he received instruction in drawing from Ernst Jordan while still a schoolboy. In 1896 he moved on to the Weimar Arts Academy where he was taught by Carl Frithjof Smith. During 1898 and 1899 he pursued his studies in Graz, after which he returned home and worked in Hanover as a free-lance artist. During the years directly after 1905, which his when he met his future wife, Emmy, he became particularly prolific. In 1908 he took a position teaching drawing and decorative art at the Arts and Crafts Academy in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Two years later, together with Georg Tappert and Max Pechstein, he was a co- founder of the New Secession artists' group. In 1920 he participated in the Berlin Secession exhibition. This was also the year in which he was given a professorship by the Berlin Arts and Crafts Academy. His students over the years included Hans Orlowski, Rudolf Bredow, Hannah H√∂ch and Nikolaus Sagrekov. By now he had embarked on a parallel career as a costume designer, and in the early 1920s he designed the costumes and stage sets for a production by Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater of The Merchant of Venice. He also involved himself in the design of mosaics and stained glass windows. In 1928 he undertook an extensive tour of South America which gave rise to a succession of water colours and pastel drawings. During the 1930s he continued with his teaching work, while the focus his own work switched to portraiture and contract work. Later in the 1930s a picture he painted of a woman was included in the Nazis' Great German Art Exhibition in Munich. This and similar works such as the ceiling painting at the National Bank in Berlin and a proposal (never built) for the Tannenberg Memorial stand in crass contrast to his earlier artistic approach. During the war, which broke out in the later summer of 1939, Bengen relocated from Berlin to Holzhausen am Ammersee in Upper Bavaria. In 1952 he moved again, this time to Hamburg, where two of his three daughters were already living, and where in 1962 he died. After 1945 the reputation which Harold Bengen had built up before 1933 was forgotten, and he was for many purposes airbrushed out of history because of the extent to which he had been willing to compromise with the dictatorship.  Works  Bengen's early work contains elements of Jugendstil (corresponding in some ways to \\"Art nouveau\\"). His artistic offering is much taken up with presentations of women. His most original and personal works - often using strong colours - date from the decade before the First World War. Much of his contribution to teaching is acknowledged in biographical works concerning his former pupils, while much of his own later artistic output was destroyed by the Second World War. Most of the earlier works, however, including many from the 1920s, survived undisturbed in a cellar until after the death of Bengen's widow, at which point, through the efforts of his three daughters, they again saw the light of day. Some were exhibited early in the twenty-first century as part of an exhibition featuring the \\"Hiddensee\\" artists' colony, and have subsequently returned in force to the catalogues of the art dealers.

Its main portion is the HOME screen, consisting of the top bar, the screenshot viewer (\\"Album\\"), and shortcuts to the Nintendo eShop, News, and Settings.  Technology  = OS = Nintendo has released only limited information about the Switch's internals to the public, however computer security researchers, homebrew software developers, and the authors of emulators have all analyzed the operating system in great depth. Notable findings include that the Switch operating system is codenamed Horizon, that it is an evolution of the Nintendo 3DS system software, and that it implements a proprietary microkernel architecture. All drivers run in userspace, including the Nvidia driver which the security researchers described as \\"kind of similar to the Linux driver\\". The graphics driver features an undocumented thin API layer, called NVN, which is \\"kind of like Vulkan\\" but exposes most hardware features like OpenGL compatibility profile with Nvidia extensions. All userspace processes use Address Space Layout Randomization and are sandboxed. Nintendo made efforts to design the system software to be as minimalist as possible, with the home menu's graphical assets using less than 200 kilobytes. This minimalism is meant to improve system performance and launch games faster. = Open source components = Despite popular misconceptions to the contrary, Horizon is not largely derived from FreeBSD code, nor from Android, although the software licence and reverse engineering efforts have revealed that Nintendo does use some code from both in some system services and drivers. For example, the networking stack in the Switch OS is derived at least in part from FreeBSD code. Nintendo's use of FreeBSD networking code is legal as it is made available under the permissive BSD licence, and not even particularly unusual ‚Äì notably, the Microsoft Windows TCP/IP stack was originally derived from BSD code in a similar fashion. Components derived from Android code include the Stagefright multimedia framework, as well as components of the graphics stack including the display server (derived from SurfaceFlinger) and the graphics driver (which seems to be derived from Nvidia's proprietary Linux driver). Although a full web browser intended for general browsing is not available on the console as of September 2020, several so-called 'applets' are included which utilise the WebKit rendering engine to display web content within a stripped back interface. A WebKit-powered applet is used to allow users to log in to captive portals when connecting to certain wireless networks, as well as for operating system features such as the Nintendo eShop, social media integrations, and digital manuals.  User interface  = Home screen = The Nintendo Switch home screen has battery, internet and time information in the top right corner, and below it is a grid showing all software on the system, downloaded or physical. Underneath that it has shortcuts to OS functions such as the news, eShop, album, controller settings, settings, and a sleep mode button. The Nintendo Switch home screen currently lacks an internet browser and a messaging system. = News = The News function of the Nintendo Switch software allows users to read gaming news and advertisements provided by Nintendo and third-party developers. News is also displayed when the system is locked. The News interface was originally available in the 1.0.0 version of the software, however new headlines were not transmitted until the 2.0.0 update was released. The 3.0.0 update revamped the News system, adding multiple news \\"channels\\" for different games that users can subscribe to. The news headlines that appear depend on which channels are subscribed to. The 4.0.0 update further improved the News screen, updating its layout. The 9.0.0 update added search support to the News channel, allowing users to narrow the list via filters or free text. The 10.0.0 update added a \\"Bookmark\\" feature, allowing users to save their favorite News articles. = Nintendo eShop = The Nintendo eShop option on the Home menu opens a WebKit-based interface that allows games to be purchased and downloaded from the Nintendo eShop. As well as games, the eShop offers select non-gaming apps. Niconico, a popular Japanese video service, launched for the Switch in Japan on 13 July 2017, and was the Switch's first third-party media app in any market. Hulu was the first video streaming application released for the Switch in the United States on 9 November 2017. A YouTube application was released on 8 November 2018.

Izneo, another comics and manga subscription service, was released for the Switch on 28 February 2019. FUZE4, a text-based programming language app, was released in August 2019. = Album = The Album stores captured screenshots and videos. Pressing the \\"Capture\\" button on the controller, in supported software, will save a screenshot, either to the microSD card, or to the system memory. The Album allows users to view screenshots that have been taken. Screenshots can be edited by adding text, and they can be shared to Facebook or Twitter. In addition, in supported games, holding down the Capture button briefly will save the last 30 seconds of video to the Album. It can then be trimmed and posted online. The 2.0.0 update added the ability to post screenshots to Facebook or Twitter from within the system UI, making it easier to share screenshots. The 4.0.0 update added support for saving 30 second videos, in compatible games. = Controllers = The Controllers menu allows controllers to be paired, disconnected, or reconnected. The 3.0.0 update added the \\"Find Controllers\\" option, which allows any nearby controllers that have been paired to be remotely turned on and vibrated, to help find lost controllers. = Settings = The Settings option allows for system settings to be changed, and includes other functionality, such as creating Miis.  History of updates  The initial version of the system software for Nintendo Switch on the launch day consoles was updated as a \\"day one\\" patch on 3 March 2017, the console's launch date. The update added online features that were previously missing from the original software before its official launch date.

It is also known as the Jesuit church and is consecrated to Saint Ildefonso of Toledo, patron of the city and Father of the Church.  Construction  Its construction took more than 100 years. Work began in 1629 on lands acquired by the Jesuits of Toledo in 1569. The location hosted the houses of Juan Hurtado de Mendoza Rojas y Guzm√°n, count of Orgaz. It was the birthplace of Saint Ildefonsus. Pedro and Estefan√≠a Manrique, high Castilian nobility's members, were the promoters of the erection of the temple, as it was written in the founding documents: Interior of the church Its approach followed the example of the Jesuit churches of Palencia and Alcal√° de Henares and that of the Church of the Ges√π, in Rome. It is the main church of the Company of Jesus. This trace has been attributed to Jan Bautista Monegro, at that time the master of the Cathedral. Jesuit architect Pedro S√°nchez, a Jesuit brother, was in charge of the construction of the temple. S√°nchez died in 1633 and was replaced by another companion of his order, Francisco Bautista, who built the facade and reredos in Baroque style. In 1669, Bautista left his place to Bartolom√© Zumbigo, native architect of Toledo, who finished the towers and the facade. San Ildefonso was consecrated in 1718, although the sacristy, the main chapel and the octave, which contains the reliquary were incomplete. In 1765, the temple was finally completed under the direction of Jose Hernandez Sierra, architect of Salamanca. Unfortunately for the order of the Jesuits, only two years after the expulsion from Spain by order of king Charles III of Spain under the charge of instigating the Esquilache Riots, which had taken place in 1766. The Company of Jesus did not recover the church until the twentieth century.

Prior to this, she spent 14 years at the Pew Research Center studying the impact of Internet technology on healthcare, and was involved in the initial launching of U.S. News & World Report's website in 1995.  Education and early career  Fox graduated Wesleyan University with a B.A. in anthropology in 1992. After graduating she worked for The Harwood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and then RealNetworks. In 1995 she joined U.S. News & World Report, helping to launch their website that year, and becoming its lead editor in 1999. Beginning in 2000, Fox spent 14 years at the Pew Research Center, directing their research on consumer-focused health and technology. Fox examined the social impact of technology on healthcare, including patients and caregivers who were crowdsourcing diagnoses and creating their own medical devices to solve their unique problems. This led her to later cite the maker movement as a promising source of healthcare innovation, and to support lowering entry barriers for innovators from nontraditional backgrounds, using methods such as altering existing medical devices or using 3D printing to engineer new devices. After her time at Pew, Fox spent a year as an Entrepreneur-in- Residence at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  Department of Health and Human Services  Fox was Chief Technology Officer of the Department of Health and Human Services during the last portion of the Obama administration, from May 2015 to January 2017. The position was initiated during the Obama administration, and was intended to act as an ambassador to the entrepreneurial and technology community in Silicon Valley and coordinating with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, rather than being focused on the agency's day-to-day technology needs. Fox was not an engineer by trade, but drew on her anthropology background to connect healthcare professionals with structural solutions, calling herself an \\"Internet geologist\\".  Personal life  Fox's father was an account executive for IBM, and her mother was an editor at the Philadelphia newspaper U.S. 1. Fox married Eric Ian Halperin, a trial lawyer, in 1998.

The MHB expresses signaling molecules that regulate the differentiation and patterning of the adjacent neuroepithelium. This allows for the development of the midbrain and hindbrain as well as the specification of neuronal subtypes in these regions.Siegelbaum, Steven A., and A. James Hudspeth. Principles of neural science. Eds. Eric R. Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas M. Jessell. Vol. 5. New York: McGraw-hill, 2013. The fact that the MHB is sufficient for the development of the mid and hindbrain was shown in an experiment where quail MHB cells transplanted into the forebrain of a chick were able to induce an ectopic midbrain and cerebellum. Development of the isthmus (MHB) The development and location of the MHB is mediated by the transcription factors Otx2 and Gbx2. Otx2 is expressed in the anterior neural tube and cells in the posterior neural tube express Gbx2. These two homeodomain transcription factors are activated by Irx1 and then cross inhibit one another in the developing central nervous system (CNS). This leads to the creation of a defined boundary that becomes the isthmic organizer region after the neural tube closes. Signaling molecules The major transcription factors and signaling molecules involved in the formation and maintenance of the isthmic organizer. The usual combined expression pattern of all involved signaling molecules is necessary for the formation and maintenance of the MHB as well as the development of the midbrain and cerebellum. The following three signaling molecules act in an interconnected network to set up and maintain the MHB. Loss of any one of them leads to not only decreased expression of the other two but will also lead to partial or complete loss of the midbrain and hindbrain. =Fgf8= The interaction between Otx2 and Gbx2 at the MHB results in the expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8). Out of the known isoforms of Fgf8, Fgf8a and Fgf8b have been shown to be expressed at the isthmic organizer with Fgf8b being prevalent. Fgf8 expression leads to the activation of En1 in cells that express both Irx1 and Otx2. Fgf8 was shown to be an organizing molecule in the MHB through an experiment where an Fgf8-loaded bead was placed on a more anterior region of the neural tube. This resulted in the formation of a new ectopic MHB and showed that Fgf8 could mimic the activity of the MHB to induce the formation of midbrain and hindbrain structures from the anterior tissues. Fgf8 signaling at the MHB combined with Otx2 expression induces dopaminergic neuron differentiation in the midbrain. On the other hand, when Fgf8 expression spreads into the Gbx2 expressing hindbrain, it leads to serotonergic neuron differentiation. Later on in embryonic development, Fgf8 expression localizes to the rostral most Gbx2 expressing cells (caudal region of the MHB) in the neural tube. Once the midbrain/hindbrain boundary has formed, Wnt1 expression localizes to the roof plate of the neural tube and to the posterior region of the midbrain. At the MHB, Wnt1 plays a role in cell proliferation and also maintains the FGF8 expression. =Engrailed-1= The transcription factor En1 is expressed in the MHB. In cells that express both Otx2 and Irx1, En1 is activated by Fgf8 signaling. En1 expression in cells that express both Pax2 and Otx2 leads to a midbrain identity/fate.

Tofu Curtain refers to a cultural or socioeconomic divide between two geographic regions and the people who reside in them, with the concept of tofu symbolizing certain lifestyles and political leanings. The term was coined to identify trends on either side of a county line in the Pioneer Valley along the Connecticut River in Massachusetts, and has also been widely used similarly with regards to gentrifying neighborhoods in Melbourne, Australia. While the Tofu Curtain most often refers to these regions of Victoria and Western Massachusetts, other tofu curtains have been named along similar socioeconomic, educational, and/or ethno-racial divides in various locations around the globe The term derives from the political and ideological Iron Curtain that separated communist Eastern Bloc countries from Western Europe during the Cold War. \\"Tofu\\" implies a high proportion of vegetarians reside on one side of the divide, and associates left wing politics with vegetarianism. Locations =Western Massachusetts= View of the Holyoke Range from Bare Mountain The line of the Tofu Curtain runs roughly east‚Äìwest along the Holyoke Range. To the north is wealthier Hampshire County, home to the Five College Consortium of Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts. To the south is Hampden County, comprising the mostly working class cities of Holyoke and Springfield, and their surrounding towns. While this southern part of the Massachusetts' Pioneer Valley is the second largest metropolitan region in the state, areas of it are economically depressed, with a deficit of available jobs and average household incomes ranging from $14,000 to $24,000 annually. Meanwhile, the more rural and collegiate areas to the north are home to a preponderance of worker cooperatives and small businesses that often manufacture and sell natural products (such as tofu) to a more affluent population. 2015-2016 SAT scores by town with the clear contrast between the north and west of the Metacomet Ridge and the Greater Springfield area While the Tofu Curtain's distinction is based on U.S. Census data and the repute of the two counties on either side of the Holyoke Range, their demographics are not absolute. Hampshire County being framed as \\"more collegiate\\" than Hampden either ignores the presence of the nine additional colleges and universities in the Springfield metropolitan area's Knowledge Corridor or regards these educational institutions as inferior to those of the Five College Consortium. In addition to being populated by affluent residents and college students, economic disparities exist within Northampton, resulting in neighborhood rifts on that side of the Tofu Curtain. Despite the presence of a wealthy college and huge university, 2016 data showed that 50% of Amherst children received free or reduced lunches at public school on the criterion of living in low-income households. Likewise, Hampden county's large working class and Puerto Rican populations have been active in community organizing and progressive politics, activities often associated with the culture of the college towns to the north. The assertion that there is a Tofu Curtain has also been a rallying point for people living and working on both sides of the county line to create equitable systems of food sovereignty, workplace democracy, and environmental justice as means to destratify the region economically while uniting it politically. =Elsewhere in the United States= People use the term \\"tofu curtain\\" to describe a similar sociopolitical phenomenon outside of Western Massachusetts. Those residing in other politically or ecologically progressive regions of New England, such as Cambridge, Massachusetts, or the entire state of Vermont, are sometimes posited as living \\"behind the Tofu Curtain.\\" Likewise, the term is used pejoratively by those wanting to deplore what they see as a liberal agenda, and posts referring to California as being \\"behind the tofu curtain\\" proliferate online forums that support expanding freedoms for civilian gun use. Tofu curtain can also be used to describe an ideological situation, not specific to the geographies of neighborhood or county lines. In a 2003 essay, Paul Gilroy described a political speak-out on a university campus and used the term \\"tofu curtain\\" as a metaphor for petty factionalizations among different strains of student activism: > As peace rallies proliferate, the campus left will have to tear down the > tofu curtain and dig itself out from underneath the wreckage of identity > politics so narcissistic and short-sighted that it reproduces the political > solipsism and imperialistic indifference that are usually associated with > power and privilege. Similarly the Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan has named a dietary split between vegetarians and meat-eaters within its membership \\"The Tofu Curtain.\\" At one point an agreement among the co-ops made the split geographical, marked by a particular corner in Ann Arbor with all co-op houses on one side having \\"veggie\\" and on the other side \\"carnie\\" kitchens. The Ann Arbor co-ops were using the term as early as 1984. =Australia= In Australia's 2016 federal election, voters south of Bell Street in Melbourne's northern suburb of Brunswick voted overwhelmingly for the Green Party and those to the north went for the Labor Party. While the neighborhoods that voted Labor still lean left politically, they tend to be more working class, and the gentrified neighborhoods of Brunswick and North Melbourne went Green. The split helped nickname Bell Street as Melbourne's own Tofu Curtain. In 2018 Australia's fossil fuel industry took advantage of the nickname by volleying the term pejoratively in attempts to divide Green Party and Labor activists from organizing together against expansion of coal mining and gas drilling. Other nicknames for Bell Street and the sociopolitical split it represents have proliferated in Melbourne, including \\"The Corduroy Line,\\" \\"The Latte Line,\\" \\"The Great Wall of Quinoa,\\" and \\"The Hipster-Proof Fence\\", evoking Australia's famed \\"rabbit-proof fence\\" of the early 20th century. =Asia= Tofu and potatoes grilled, served and eaten at a street stall in Yunnan, China Because tofu originated in China, Japan, Korea, and other regions of East Asia, the term \\"tofu curtain\\" has also described differences between eastern and western culture. A 2007 study conducted by the United Nations's Food and Agriculture Organization showed that in one year China consumed nearly 100 times the amount of soybeans per person over the United States, while the Japan-to-U.S. per capita rate of consumption was more than 200-to-1. and that same year the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database revealed that Korea's soy consumption rate fell about midway between Japan's and China's. 2013 data showed these proportions to be about the same, with Taiwan consuming the highest amount of soyfoods per capita at a rate 15% higher than that of Japan's. While ethnicity and diet are considerations in this particular usage, political leanings are a lesser factor on the Asian side of the curtain, as tofu is a dietary staple in Asia and therefore not associated with particular political parties, movements, or factions. In other media In September 2016 Western Massachusetts residents launched TofuCurtain.com, a site for \\"Satire and Commentary in the Pioneer Valley.\\" Among the site's earliest stories were \\"Recent Graduate Will Shave, Cut Hair After Finding Job,\\" \\"WikiLeaks Release Reveals Town of Hadley Extremely Boring,\\" \\"Hampshire College Replaces American Flag with 'For Sale' Sign,\\" and \\"New Privilege Checkpoint at Coolidge Bridge raises Traffic Concerns.\\" By the end of 2018, the website no longer existed.

She went on to become the director of the Madison Square Housing Association, director of the Middle East Community, and the leader of a neighborhood 4-H Club. The Baltimore riot of 1968 resulting from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. propelled Gorham's role in neighborhood activism. In August 1968, Gorham began to operate \\"Our House,\\" clubhouse that offered services to the community including home-cooked meals, a place for local children to spend their Saturday evenings, and a spot for senior citizens to meet with friends. Later in life, Gorham fought against the expansion of the Johns Hopkins Hospital medical complex in 2002. As a result of the expansion, Gorham was forced out of her home in the Middle East neighborhood of East Baltimore and moved to a home in the Belair-Edison neighborhood of Northeast Baltimore. Gorham died at 81 years old from a battle with cancer.

History Alt-S√ºns Castle was built around 1200 by the Freiherr von Vaz as the center of their estates in the Domleschg valley. Their Herrschaft of Paspels/S√ºns was first mentioned in a record in 1237, but the castle wasn't mentioned until 1285. When the last male heir of the Vaz line, Donat von Vaz, died in 1338, the castle and lands were inherited by the Counts of Werdenberg- Sargans. They sold it to the von Matsch family in 1365, but retained the right to buy it back, which they did toward the end of the 14th century. The castle was specifically mentioned in a treaty between Schwyz, Glarus and Werdenberg- Sargans in 1437. The castle was destroyed in 1451 during a war between the residents of the Schams valley against Werdenberg-Sargans. The attackers demolished the south-west corner of the castle, rendering it useless. After a peace treaty was signed in 1452, the Counts abandoned the castle. Castle site The castle was built on a hill top near the village of Paspels and not far from Neu-S√ºns Castle. The main tower is located on the eastern side of the hill. It is and has thick walls. Except where the south-west corner was pulled down, the tower is four stories tall. The original tower was only three stories tall, but in a second construction phase, the fourth story was added as well as a ring wall. The ring wall was built with decorative opus spicatum patterns in the stonework. Today only a portion of the eastern wall remains. On the western side of the hill there are a few traces of an outer bailey. It probably contained storage or production buildings, though nothing is visible today.

She is known as the writer of the first Turkish poem for International Workers' Day on 1 May. Ya≈üar Nezihe differed from other female poets of the period in the sense of her life story and a contrary literary identity. Throughout her lifetime, she wrote poems about her penurious and challenging childhood as well as her love life and marriages. Being known as the first female poet whose works were published in Aydƒ±nlƒ±k Dergisi (Enlightenment Journal), Ya≈üar Nezihe also became prominent for supporting labour unrests and her activist identity. She was recognised as a socialist poet who gave voice to poverty in her poems. She wrote the poem named \\"Gazete Sahiplerine\\" (To Newspaper Owners) addressing the executives with the intent of supporting labourers who were on strike because of the disagreement between newspaper owners and M√ºrettipler Cemiyeti (Typesetters Society).  Early life  Ya≈üar Nezihe was born in Silivri, Istanbul in 1882 as one of the five children of a low-income family. She was the only child survived in the family. She was only six years old when she lost her mother, Kaya Hanƒ±m. Thereafter, her paralysed aunt and her alcoholic father looked after her. After spending most of her time in the streets, she enrolled in a school herself due to the indifference of her family. The moment when her father throw her out of the house because of her independent behaviour, he actually paved the way for her \\"liberation\\". She had three unhappy marriages and her two children died of food shortage. To earn money, she wrote letters for illiterate people and stitched.

In the archive of the researcher Taha Toros, there are three collections of her poems. ≈ûiir Defteri (Poems Book) is her last, unpublished work that she resigned to Toros.

Young was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Dr. Howard E. Young, Maryland's first African American pharmacist, and Estelle Hall Young. Her father's pharmacy served as a place of inspiration for Young as a child: > I admired the doctors...and I wanted to be able to send my prescriptions to > my father's drugstore. She attended the old Colored High School (now Fredrick Douglass High School) in Baltimore. Following her graduation in 1924, Young enrolled in Howard University where she earned her bachelor of science degree in social sciences and later obtained her medical degree from the Howard University School of Medicine in 1930. Young initially served as an intern at Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., after she was not accepted to the Provident Hospital in Baltimore due to the lack of housing accommodations for women. After her internship, Young opened her own practice in offices above her father's drugstore in 1932. In 1934, she accepted an invitation from W.E.B. DuBois to attend a NAACP conference. Around the same time, she was appointed staff physician at the Maryland Training School for Girls, where she served from 1933-1940. When the Baltimore health department budget was cut in 1933, Young volunteered her services to ensure coverage in the colored schools. Young also advocated for frank and practical sex education for girls. Young believed that physicians should be free to choose their medical specialities \\"regardless of sex, race, color, and creed.\\" Young's initial medical specialization was pediatrics, but after the death of an infant, she switched her specialization to gynecology. During that time, she became the only African American physician to receive training in birth control at the Baltimore Birth Control Clinic, where she was trained by Dr. Bessie Moses. With funding from the Baltimore Birth Control Clinic, Dr. Young opened a Planned Parenthood Clinic, located at 1523 McCulloh Street, which was one of only three such clinics then staffed entirely by African Americans in the entire United States in May 1938. After ten years at the clinic, Young was granted residency to specialize in ob-gyn at Provident Hospital, where she served as chief form 1950 to 1963.

Due to his business involvements, Adams was also a prominent figure in Baltimore politics, although he never held office himself.  Early life  William L. Adams was born on January 5, 1914 in Zebulon, North Carolina, and moved to Baltimore in 1929. Adams attended Dunbar High School for several years, and worked several jobs during that time, including running numbers. He eventually ended up running his own numbers game. He married Victorine Quille on October 13, 1935 at St. Peter Claver Catholic Church.  Business career  Adams used the profits from his illegal lottery to finance a number of legitimate businesses, including a real estate firm and a tavern. He owned Carr's Beach, a popular amusement park in Annapolis, MD, Since most banks would not lend to black-owned businesses at that time, Adams found opportunity investing in such businesses. His most successful investments included Parks Sausages and Super Pride supermarkets. By the late 1970s, Adams' wealth was estimated at $40M.  Legal issues  In 1951, Adams was subpoenaed to testify before Congress during an investigation into organized crime. At that time, he admitted to having run an illegal lottery in Baltimore, and the State of Maryland subsequently charged with that crime. His conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the state had violated Adams' Fifth Amendment rights by using his Congressional testimony. In 1980, Adams was again charged with running an illegal lottery. He was found not guilty of these charges.  Political and community involvement Adams was instrumental in the election of Maryland's first black US Representative, Parren Mitchell. He started a scholarship program for students seeking to major in business, partnering with the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund.

She was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan but her time spent hiking in the Canadian Rockies and the Okanagan Valley has shaped her artistic style.  Family life  The daughter of Adela and John Hawke Grayson, Grayson was born on the family farm near Moose Jaw. She began painting as a young girl, and was given lessons by a local artist named Gertrude Rorason. After she married Arthur J. Mann in 1929, she moved to Summerland, British Columbia. Grayson moved back to Moose Jaw in 1961 and later died there at the age of 100.  Work and education  After completing high school, she travelled in Europe, Africa and South America with her cousin Ethel, attending schools in Budapest and London. She continued her education at St. Margaret's College in Toronto, at the Curry School of Expression in Massachusetts, and at Columbia University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science. She worked as an advisor for the Moose Jaw school board and as an art instructor at teachers' colleges in Regina and Moose Jaw. Grayson also published art appreciation textbooks for elementary and secondary school students. She taught at the University of British Columbia, at the Summer School of Fine Arts in Penticton and at the Banff School of Fine Arts. After Arthur's death, she travelled to Japan, New Zealand, and Mexico to further pursue her art. In Mexico, at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende, she studied with artist Fred Samuelson.  Artwork  Grayson painted in the impressionist style. Her work appeared in exhibitions in the United States and Canada and is included in the collections of the Art Gallery of Hamilton and the Moose Jaw Museum & Art Gallery. She painted in oil and watercolours and also produced silk screen prints. In 1942, her work was included in British Columbia's Annual Exhibition.  Writing  She also composed a manuscript entitled Adventures of an Artist in the Canadian Rockies that was published posthumously.

Her main series of buildings in Kolmanskop show how the Namib desert's sands have reclaimed abandoned buildings. She is a member of the Professional Photographers in Southern Africa (PPSA) and her works have been exhibited and collected internationally, though especially prominent in Namibia.  Early life  Helga Kohl was born in 1943 in Silesia, Poland. She emigrated to West Germany in 1958, where she studied photography and received a degree from the M√ºnster Chamber of Trade. In 1970, Kohl moved to Namibia, where she has worked as a freelance photographer since 1975.  Career  Her work has explored the abandoned diamond mining sites, particularly those of Kolmanskop in the southern Namib desert. Kohl's photographs capture how the mining town, abandoned in 1954, has been reclaimed by waves of sand. She returned to the site over several decades to capture the changing light, shadow, and architectural wear. During her visits, she would sit and watch the dunes shift in the rooms before deciding to photograph. The final series spent four years in production (1993‚Äì1997). Kohl's 1997 Elisabeth Bay series explored the abandoned Namibian diamond mining site by the same name. The mine was active between 1908 and 1948. Her pictures document the remnants of how people once occupied the mining town. Its desert-eroded ruins show both where people once lived and the effects of time and nature on human enterprise. She joined the Professional Photographers in Southern Africa (PPSA) in 1989, received their President's Award in 1993, and was awarded a fellowship in fine art photography in 1998. Throughout the 1990s, she held solo exhibitions in Windhoek, Swakopmund, and Cape Town, and at the 1995 Miss Universe beauty pageant in the Namibian capital. Kohl participated in group exhibitions in Windhoek and Johannesburg, and in several Standard Bank Namibia biennales, of which she won first prize in 2001. Her photographs were the \\"signature images\\" of the 2005 Rencontres Africaines de la Photographie, held in Bamako, Mali, after which they were exhibited internationally and donated to the Namibian national archives. Kohl published a book on the photographs, Kolmanskop: Past and Present, a year prior. In 2007, Kohl exhibited at Voies Off at Arles and began an artist residency in Bremen. Her photographs were also shown in a 2013 exhibition at the Washington, D.C.-based National Museum of African Art, Earth Matters: Land as Material and Metaphor in the Arts of Africa. Kohl's works reside in private collections internationally and in the public collection of the National Art Gallery of Namibia.

He was elected as the President of an organization which aimed to bring together Republican voters, improve voter registration rates especially for the Republican party and to ensure the wellbeing of black people overall. Callaway was a real estate broker and an influential figure in Republican Politics in Maryland. In 1923 when he became president of the Baltimore Republican Party. In 1935, Callaway led a lobbying effort to persuade the Maryland legislature to study the question of whether to make the historically black Morgan College a state institution. A legislative commission ended up making a recommendation in favor of transferring Morgan to the state of Maryland, a move that was finalized in 1937. He organised Theodore McKeldin's 1950 campaign for the position of Mayor of Baltimore. He was recognized at a meeting of over 1500 people at the Bethel AME Church in Baltimore in 1939 for his work. Later in his life, Marse was charged with eight counts of receiving money under false pretenses and one count of failing to pay a former employee seven weeks wages. Twelve further charges of larceny after trust of funds paid by persons as deposits on pieces of property were added to the indictment to which he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence and when summing up Judge Robert France asserted that Callaway had been \\"a respected and outstanding citizen in his own community and the city of Baltimore\\". Callaway was also ordered to pay restitution. Marse Callaway died on May 19, 1952 at Provident Hospital.

Few members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but others are known from inscriptions. The best-known may be Marcus Orfius, a military tribune who served under the command of Caesar.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 44 (\\"Marcus Orfius\\"). Origin Chase regards the nomen Orfius as the Oscan cognate of the Latin name Orbius, which is derived from the cognomen Orbus, meaning a waif or orphan. He suggests Orfa as the Oscan equivalent of Orbus.Chase, pp. 127, 128, 131.Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary, s. v. Orfitus. An Oscan origin for the family would seem to be supported by the fact that Marcus Orfius was a native of Atella in Campania.Cicero, Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem, ii. 14. The same root would seem to have given rise to the surname Orfitus, found in a number of families, notably the Salvidieni and Cornelii, in imperial times, and to the nomen Orfidius, formed either directly from the cognomen, or perhaps from Orfius using the suffix -idius, sometimes used to form new gentilicia from existing names.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 43, 44 (\\"Orfitus\\").Chase, pp. 121, 122. Praenomina Most of the Orfii used only the most common praenomina, including Gaius, Lucius, and Marcus. There are a few instances of other common praenomina, including Titus, Quintus, and Gnaeus, as well as one instance of Vibius, an much less common name, frequently associated with families of Sabine or Oscan origin. Members * Marcus Orfius, an eques from Atella, was a military tribune in Caesar's army, probably during the latter's consulship in 59 BC. Cicero had a high opinion of him, and recommended him to his brother, Quintus, who was serving as one of Caesar's legates. * Marcus Orfius M. f. M. n.

The Brotherhood of Liberty used legal means to protect the civil rights of African American people. The Brotherhood of Liberty was founded by Rev. Harvey Johnson, a pastor at Union Baptist Church, and other local pastors, Ananias Brown, William Moncure Alexander, Patrick Henry Alexander, John Calvin Allen, and W. Charles Lawson. They advocated for the right of colored people to practice law in Maryland. The Brotherhood of Liberty created schools for the black community and were pioneers in assisting colored people in getting a better education, being united, and improving their standard of living. At the time the Brotherhood was established in Baltimore, there was no high school for African American children and no African American teachers. African American educators passed the examination to become a teacher, but the school board refused to appoint them as teachers. Separate African American schools had all white teachers. The brotherhood petitioned and appeared before the city council, the board of school commissioner and the city courts to resolve this issue. The school board said that there were not enough of African Americans on the Northwest side of Baltimore to have a public elementary school. The brotherhood enrolled 300 children at Shiloh Baptist Church and hired three teachers. The school board was convinced and the first new school for African Americans was built at Carrollton and Riggs Ave. The first African American appointed teacher and principal were Fannie Barbour and George Biddle. The school was not opened immediately because whites in the area were determined to take over the school and make it all-white. The Brotherhood of Liberty created the first colored schools with colored teachers and principals and provided them with resources to succeed. The Brotherhood of Liberty and its members accomplished much for the African American community in Maryland. In 1885, Everett Waring, council member of the Brotherhood of Liberty, became the first black attorney to practice law in the Maryland court system. Waring was the first black person admitted to the bar of Court of Appeals in 1880, which opened the door to allowing five more black Baltimoreans to be allowed admittance to the University of Maryland School of Law in 1890. In 1889 William M. Alexander, an original member of the Brotherhood of Liberty, opened Public School No. 9, the first public school for black children. In 1888 at Irving Park, the Brotherhood celebrated the removal of the word \\"white\\" from statute books of Maryland. Further reading * Dennis Patrick Halpin. 2019.

Karn then went on to graduate from New York's High School of Music and Art in 1941. However, after the death of her father in 1941 Stoll Karn began working at the New York Life Insurance Company in an effort to support her family. Soon after that Karn's artwork was discovered by her building's janitor, and she was introduced to Rafael DeSoto, another resident of her building and an artist who illustrated pulp magazines. Karn began working as a freelance pulp artist for Popular Publications which was one of the largest publishers of pulp magazines at the time.  Career  Stoll Karn is acknowledged for her work in the pulp fiction industry during the 1940s. Karn was one of the few female illustrators working in this field at the time. Karn published over 100 full color covers in pulp magazines during her career. She often drew pictures of young couples or brave soldiers and cowboys or grizzled detectives and criminals, as was popular and pulp magazines and movies in the 1940s. Karn's figures were extremely expressive and was able to created colorful and clearly delineated so that stood out on newsstands. Karn exhibited an immense range in her work, and was able to specialize in both the romance and mystery genre, something unique to pulp artists at the time. In 1948 Gloria Stoll Karn married Fred Karn, a chemist, and moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although Stoll Karn attempted to continue her work, she found that shipping her painted canvases to her publishers in New York was too challenging an undertaking. Karn went on to raise three children, all while continuing to create artworks. She began creating paintings of religious subjects, as well as abstract painting, and in the seventy years she lived in Pittsburgh her art was displayed in venues such as Carnegie Museum of Art, the Hoyt Art Center, as well as local churches. Although Karn stopped creating pul illustrations, she began attending classes at Carnegie Mellon University, and taught collage and painting classes at the Community College of Allegheny County, The Sweetwater Center for the Arts, and the North Hills Art Center. Although the popularity of pulp magazines has declined immensely, beginning in the 1940s due to wartime paper shortages and ultimately ending in the 1950s because of the rise in television as a growing use of leisure time Stoll Karn's work has in many ways outlived the genre itself. In 2018, Karn's work was showcased in a solo exhibition at the Norman Rockwell Museum, titled Gloria Stoll Karn: Pulp Romance. She has participated in an exhibition at The American Jewish Museum, Squirrel Hill.http://www.post- gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2011/03/23/Students-of-Samuel-Rosenberg-pay- homage-to-their-teacher-in-art-exhibit/stories/201103230274 She was Guest of Honor at PulpFest 2017, near her hometown of Pittsburgh.

It provides information authored by business people and/or used by business people.

Technical metadata includes the database table name and column name, data type, indexes referencing the data, ETL jobs involving the data, when the data was last updated, accessed, etc.  Concept  According to noted author and columnist Lowell Fryman, \\"The essence of business metadata is in reducing or eliminating the barriers of communication between human and human, as well as human and computer, so that the data conveyed from reports, information systems, or business intelligence applications can be crystal clear, can facilitate business operations, and can be leveraged for all business decision-making processes.\\" Dan Linstedt, creator of the Data Vault methodology, says business metadata \\"...provide[s] definition of the functionality, definition of the data, definition of the elements, and definition of how the data is used within business...business metadata includes business requirements, time- lines, business metrics, business process flows, and business terminology.\\" Business metadata is important because it can greatly facilitate the usefulness of the data to business people. A simple example of business metadata is a glossary entry. Hover functionality in an application or web form can enable a glossary definition to be shown when cursor is on a field or term. Other examples of business metadata include annotation ability within applications. For example, a business user may be viewing a business intelligence (BI) report and notice a trend in the data. The user may have background knowledge as to why this trend occurs. Some business intelligence tools enable the user to create an annotation within the report that explains the trend.

Career  In 1971, Norman founded the Lesbian Mothers Union (later known as Lesbian Mothers and Friends); it was concerned with custody problems and provided support for lesbian mothers, who were routinely stripped of their parental rights for being openly gay. As a counselor with the Center for Special Problems from 1972-1979, she wrote and implemented policy regarding mental health services for sexual minority communities. She also developed training programs for health workers who served these communities, training over 300+ staff members to become competent, sensitive, and aware of the needs of the LGBTQ+ communities. Norman was the first openly gay employee of the San Francisco Health Department. While employed with the San Francisco Health Department from 1978-1987, she created the position of Coordinator of Lesbian/Gay Health Services in which she served the gay and lesbian community in San Francisco and helped initiate community response to the AIDS epidemic, which became a main focus for the department in 1982.Boellstorff, T.

The style was developed by American fly tier Bob Popovics in the 1970s for bluefish, tuna and striped bass on the Atlantic coast. Origins Surf Candy as a saltwater fly design was originated by Bob Popovics, an American fly tier from New Jersey. Popovics pioneered the use of epoxy to create durability and translucency in saltwater flies. Bluefish were notorious for quickly damaging flies with their sharp teeth and Popovics began experimenting with epoxy bodied flies in 1970 to improve durability. However, it wasn't until the late 1980s that Popovics introduced the Surf Candy style to the public. The original Surf Candies were tied with bucktail or polar bear hair but the flies quickly evolved with the use of synthetic materials like ultrahair. Although the original purpose of the epoxy was for durability, it had the added side-effect of providing translucency for the body, a characteristic that enhanced imitations of a wide variety of baitfish. Imitates The original Surf Candy flies were tied to imitate sand eels or sand lances, Atlantic silversides or spearing, bay anchovy (often called rainfish) and finger mullet (young mullet). Materials The original surf candy flies were tied with white buck tail wings and without eyes. Popovics coated the entire head and body of the fly with epoxy for durability. Early surf candy flies were also tied with polar bear fur for added translucency. Original versions used a red marker to place a red slash behind to the head to simulate gills. Today's surf candy flies are typically tied with synthetic fibers, Mylar flash for accents and body and some form of eyes. Instead of epoxy, fly tiers use various ultraviolet or blue light cured cements for a faster drying time. Epoxy or UV cured cements are applied to the entire body of the fly from hook eye to hook bend for durability and translucency. Eyes can be added to the head of the fly a more realistic pattern. Most surf candy flies are tied with clear monofilament threads to enhance the effects of translucency. Variations and sizes Surf Candy flies are typically tied on size 4 through 4/0 saltwater hooks. By layering different colors, textures and amount of synthetic fibers fly tiers can create a the desired profile of the different baitfish the Surf Candy imitates.

Most probably it was built in Mozarab style in the 12th-century, in the 17th century a Baroque chapel was added to it housing the Virgen de Esperanza.

He then spent some time in Rome in the 1860s studying under the sculptor John Gibson before returning to Glasgow in 1862. He went on to be the most successful Scottish sculptor of his time.

History A new church in the Bernstorffsvej area was first proposed in 1940. A committee was put in charge of realizing the project in 1942. A site was also acquired. The chair of the committee was the chaplain from Hellerup Church, N√∏rup-Nielsen, who would later become the first pastor of Helleruplund Church. He was the one who proposed the name with a reference to the property at Bernstorffsvej 98. The construction of the church was delayed by World War II and the shortage of building materials that followed after the liberation. Helleruplund Parish was disjoined from those of Hellerup, Dysseg√•rd and Gentofte in 1949. A temporary church was also inaugurated in a wooden building which had been acquired from the Knivholdt Camp at Frederikshavn, dismantled and rebuilt at Bernstorffsvej. In the early 1950s the plans for a permanent church was finally revived. The church was designed by Arthur Wittmaack and Vilhelm Hvals√∏e. The foundation stone was set on 11 Kune 1966 by church minister Bodil Koch and it was inaugurated in December 1956. The temporary church was used as a parish hall until a new one was built. Architecture The church is built in red brick and stands on a base of granite. It has a cruciform layout and a canted chancel. The tower stands 42 m tall and has a copper-clad spire sloping shoulders. Its clock was a gift from Superfoss-CEO Vonsild. The church bells were donated by A.P.

It was based in Paris, France. Pegs was used for several animated feature films, shorts, and television series, and it powered the French animation industry until the 2000s as it was used by studios like Millimages, Alphanim, and Animage, but it was also used by studios in other countries, most notably Saerom Animation, CineGroupe, and Mike Young Productions. In total, Pegs was used by over 100 studios worldwide. History In 1991, Pixibox, a French animation studio, decided to develop its own ink & paint and compositing tools in order to make one of the first fully digital animated series, Peter et Sonia. The first version of Pegs was released under the name Pixiscan. In 1994, Pixibox began to market the product, and the first Pegs licenses were sold. In 1997, following the acquisition of the company by Humanoids Group, Mediapegs was set up in order to handle the development and licensing of Pegs. In 1999, a new version of Pegs for Windows NT was launched, which allowed users to animate with both bitmaps and vectors. In September 2003, after two uneasy years for the animation market, Mediapegs was forced to file for bankruptcy. After Mediapegs closed, four former employees grew increasingly concerned about the demise of Pegs and the future of professionals using the technology. Bolstered by the support of many within the animation industry, they decided to create a new company called Pegs'n Co. In June 2004, a new version of Pegs was released, and Pegs'n Co enjoyed renewed success, taking part in Annecy's festival with a new version every year, and being involved in feature films and numerous international shows. In 2006, Toon Boom acquired Pegs'n Co(Jun. 6, 2006). \\"Toon Boom Animation acquires Pegs‚Äôn Co‚Äôs\\" [Studio Daily]. Retrieved March 2, 2017. as part of its growth strategy. Since the acquisition, the software has not been updated and can no longer be purchased.
