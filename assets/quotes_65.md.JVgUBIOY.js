His favoured position is at fullback. He is a son of former All Black Bryan Williams and the brother of Gavin Williams, who plays internationally for Samoa and for French club Clermont. Playing career =New Zealand= Williams was born 22 April 1983 in Auckland, New Zealand. As one of the most promising young players in New Zealand rugby, Williams was signed by the Highlanders for the 2003 season, aged only 19 and having never played NPC rugby. He quickly showed his ability, earning the starting job at fullback and scoring his first Super Rugby try before suffering a broken leg in his 6th appearance for the side. Williams' broken leg would turn into a nightmare, as it failed to heal properly and required multiple operations, including a re- breaking of the bone in 2004. He was provisionally named in the Highlanders squad for the 2004 season and again for the 2006 season, but dropped out before each season when it became obvious he wasn't fully recovered. Finally healthy in 2006, he signed for Canterbury and made 4 appearances in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, which were his first competitive games in over three years. Despite the limited game action, he was signed by the Crusaders for the 2007 season, although he didn't see any game action. Back with Canterbury for the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup, Williams appeared in every match ‚Äì mainly on the wing ‚Äì and impressed with his solid performances. This saw him re-signed by the Highlanders for the 2008 season, where he started all 13 matches and earned All Black consideration for his strong play at fullback. He played for Canterbury in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup, where his excellent form continued as he scored 6 tries in helping his side to the title. In 2009 he returned to his hometown of Auckland. He spent the 2009 season and 2010 season with the Auckland Blues, where he was a consistent player. However, he played off the bench as often as he started. He also played for Auckland in the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, and he was named Auckland player of the year in 2009. =Europe= After declaring for Samoa internationally in 2010, Williams signed with the Sale Sharks of the Aviva Premiership for the 2010‚Äì11 season. Williams was a regular starter for the Sharks at fullback, scoring 2 tries in 20 appearances. However, he chose to leave Sale after only one season to sign in France with Stade Fran√ßais for the 2010‚Äì11 season. International career In May 2008 Williams gained selection for a New Zealand training squad for the 2008 international season, however he never played for the All Blacks. Williams was eligible to play for Samoa internationally as he spent much of his childhood in the country while his father was coaching the Samoan national team. Unlikely to make the All Blacks squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, he declared his intention to play for Samoa in 2010 and made his debut against Tonga in the 2010 IRB Pacific Nations Cup on 12 June.http://www.worldrugby.org/match/11424http://www.scrum.com/scrum/rugby/player/117765.html References External links *Blues Profile *All Blacks initial training Squad *Timeline of Williams' injury layoff 1983 births New Zealand rugby union players New Zealand people of Cook Island descent New Zealand people of Samoan descent Samoa international rugby union players Auckland rugby union players Blues (Super Rugby) players Highlanders (rugby union) players Crusaders (rugby union) players Canterbury rugby union players Sale Sharks players Stade Fran√ßais rugby players Rugby union fullbacks New Zealand expatriate rugby union players Expatriate rugby union players in England Expatriate rugby union players in France New Zealand expatriate sportspeople in England New Zealand expatriate sportspeople in France Rugby union players from Auckland Living people ","title":"Paul Williams (rugby union)"},{"id":"15979989","text":"John Alfred Spencer (6 July 1931 ‚Äì 4 March 1996) was a New Zealand boat designer.

The car, a desert gold and sand dune white two-tone sport coupe which displayed only four miles on its odometer, was entombed as part of the city of Tulsa's \\"Tulsarama\\" Golden Jubilee Week festivities celebrating Oklahoma's 50th year of statehood. The unnamed vehicle was intended to be a prize awarded upon the vehicle's unearthing to the individual, or their descendant, who came nearest to guessing Tulsa's population in 2007. A matching automobile had been awarded in a separate contest a few days prior. Nicknamed the Miss Belvedere by a member of the committee organizing the 2007 event, she was unearthed on June 14, 2007, during the state's centennial celebration and publicly unveiled the next day. Reflecting the Cold War tensions endemic in late 1950s America, the enclosure - built of poured in place concrete and sprayed with pneumatically applied gunite - was advertised as having been built to withstand a nuclear attack. However, the vault was breached by long term water intrusion, that submerged the entire vehicle, causing significant cosmetic and structural damage.TulsaWorld: Buried Belvedere vault full of water Efforts were made to stabilize Miss Belvedere's condition, including essential suspension repairs, with the hope of placing her in a museum. After being stored for ten years, she was accepted by the Historic Auto Attractions Museum in Roscoe, Illinois, and shipped in June 2017.  History  =Burial (1957)= 250px As part of the city of Tulsa's \\"Tulsarama\\" Golden Jubilee Week festivities celebrating Oklahoma's 50th year of statehood, it was decided to bury, in an underground vault, a new desert gold and sand dune white two-tone 1957 Plymouth Belvedere sport coupe. Also, along with the unnamed vehicle, other contemporary items were placed inside the vault as a time capsule for the people of the year 2007. It was felt that these items, when the vault was opened in 2007, would help acquaint future generations with life in 1957. When asked why the 1957 Plymouth Belvedere was chosen, event chairman Lewis Roberts Sr. was quoted that the car represented \\"an advanced product of American industrial ingenuity with the kind of lasting appeal that will still be in style 50 years from now.\\" The car was donated by Plymouth Motors and a group of Plymouth car dealers from the Tulsa area . Ultimately, the car was intended to be a prize awarded upon the vehicle's unearthing for the individual, or their descendant, who came nearest to guessing Tulsa's population in 2007. An additional prize of the value of a savings account, started with a $100.00 deposit in 1957, would also be awarded to the winner of the car. The contest for the Miss Belvedere was advertised with the slogan ‚ÄúSuddenly It‚Äôs 2,007‚Äù which was a variation of the 1957 Plymouth advertising campaign ‚ÄúSuddenly, it‚Äôs 1960 ...‚Äù. A second matching Plymouth Belvedere had been awarded, in a separate contest, a few days prior to Miss Belvedere's burial in the vault. A large number of items were placed inside the trunk and glove box of Miss Belvedere. A partial list of items included a five-gallon container of gasoline, a case of motor oil, a case of Schlitz beer and items that were considered typical contents of a woman's purse, which included a bottle of tranquilizers, an unpaid parking ticket, 14 bobby pins, a compact, cigarettes and matches, two combs, a tube of lipstick, a package of gum, a plastic rain hat, pocket facial tissues, and $2.73 in bills and coins. Some of the items placed in the sealed steel capsule, welded shut and painted white, behind the car included a 48-star American Flag, letters from various state and city officials and documentation for a savings account valued at $100 in 1957 along with entry postcards for the contest regarding the city's population in 2007. A by underground poured in place concrete vault, with pneumatically applied gunite on its interior walls, had been prepared in the courthouse lawn with the top of the vault being three feet below the surface. Miss Belvedere was placed on a steel skid with her tires off the ground and the vehicle was lowered into the vault a number of times for publicity photos to be taken. After being lowered for the final time the Miss Belvedere was coated in a cosmoline like substance and was then wrapped in layers of sealed plastic. It was hoped that these actions would protect the car from moisture that might seep in. Concrete beams were set on top of the vault as a lid and then the beams were sprayed with gunite to seal the vault. Following the replacement of dirt and sod a bronze marker, donated by a local cemetery, was placed to mark the spot. In 1997 there were some people expecting that the Miss Belvedere would be unearthed due to the inscription on the marker which read \\"Golden Jubilee, Inc. Time Capsule with 1957 Plymouth To Be Opened in 2007 by Centennial Committee.\\" It was mistakenly thought that the \\"Centennial Committee\\" referred to the group that was organizing the centennial celebration for the City of Tulsa in 1997. File:PlymouthTulsa.jpg|alt=Plaque over the unopened time capsule in Tulsa, Oklahoma.|Plaque over the time capsule containing \\"Miss Belvedere\\". Photo taken in Tulsa, OK on March 16, 2006. The vault was opened the following year in celebration of Oklahoma's statehood centennial celebration. =Unearthing (2007)= In the years leading up to the anticipated opening of the vault, speculation abounded on the car's condition. Many felt that the car would be found in near pristine condition, but others expressed concern that moisture may have entered the vault causing moderate to extensive damage. It was not known if a nearby construction accident in 1973, in which a water main was damaged flooding the area, had any effect on the vault. After eighteen months of preparations by a group of volunteers, the vault was opened on June 14, 2007, during the state's centennial celebration. In press interviews, the 2007 organizing committee co-chairwoman Sharon King Davis acknowledged that she was the person who had named the vehicle Miss Belvedere. However, the official website used leading up to the event did not feature the Miss Belvedere name. Interest in the event became international, with news organizations and interested people from abroad making plans to attend the event. Organizers had made arrangements with vehicle customizer Boyd Coddington, under a sponsorship arrangement with Amsoil, to use the sponsors products in starting the car when it was removed from the vault. A local crane service had volunteered to lift the Miss Belvedere out of the vault, and customized lifting equipment was fabricated for the job. An identical model Plymouth Belvedere was found and test lifts were made with the vehicle to ascertain the center of gravity for the lift. Those working on the project were dismayed when it was found that the car was sitting in nearly of standing water that was high. It also appeared that at some point the vault had been filled with water to a point just below the lid, covering the entire vehicle. In line with the Cold War realities of late 1950s America, the concrete enclosure was advertised as having been built to withstand a nuclear attack; however, it was not airtight, which allowed water to seep in. While the car was still wrapped in the ripped plastic covering, the exact condition of the Miss Belvedere was unknown. Previous speculation that water entering the vault may have caused significant damage to the vehicle was soon realized. A hazmat team had been brought in to assess any danger to the public when the vault was opened. Their testing revealed only hydrocarbons that were from the oil and gas that was buried with the vehicle. The standing water was then pumped out of the vault and preparations were made to lift the Miss Belvedere out. Miss Belvedere was lifted from the vault and transported to the Tulsa Convention Center, where it was publicly unveiled on June 15, 2007. Boyd Coddington and his team were on hand to evaluate and start the car, but that proved impossible due to the car's condition. Upon inspection, it was found that the keys for the Miss Belvedere were corroded in the ignition. The tires were able to be inflated, and signatures of those who were on hand when the Miss Belvedere was buried were still legible. Items buried with the vehicle in a sealed steel container emerged unscathed, but anything buried unprotected in the vehicle was heavily damaged or had deteriorated completely from the water intrusion. Among the items recovered from the trunk were rusty cans from a case of Schlitz beer and the containers of gasoline and oil that was intended to be used for starting the car in 2007 if gasoline was no longer the fuel of choice for motor vehicles. The glass containers containing gasoline and motor oil, that were buried with the Miss Belvedere, were taken to the University of Oklahoma for testing and research. Following the unveiling ceremony, Miss Belvedere was temporarily placed on display at a local car dealership. The Miss Belvedere was intended to be a prize awarded to the individual, or his or her descendant, who came nearest to guessing Tulsa's population in 2007. Out of 812 entries, the winning entrant was Raymond Humbertson, whose guess of 384,743 was closest to the actual figure of 382,457. It was found out that Raymond Humbertson had died in 1979, his wife in 1988, and the couple did not have any children. The Miss Belvedere and the value of the $100.00 savings account started in 1957, that had grown to the amount of $666.85, was awarded to Humbertson's surviving sisters and nephew. Humbertson's relatives expressed surprise, because he had never lived in the Tulsa area; they were unsure of the circumstances leading him to enter the contest in 1957. =Stabilization efforts= In November 2007, Humbertson's relatives shipped the Miss Belvedere to the New Jersey facilities of Ultra One, a restoration firm whose specialty product is a de-rusting solution which is designed to remove only rust while leaving the underlying metal, paint and decals intact. It was estimated that the stabilization project would take roughly six months or perhaps longer, given the difficulty of removing the mix of cosmoline and mud that were caked on the car. While there were no plans to disassemble or restore the vehicle, there were discussions regarding the return of the driveline and electrical system to operating condition. In May 2009, when Dwight Foster of Ultra One participated in a podcast and provided details and new pictures, it was shown that Miss Belvedere's restoration was still underway, with the car's exterior having been virtually freed of its rust and mud concretions.Hemmings Collector Car Radio, episode 16: De-rusting Miss Belvedere, why cash for clunkers doesn‚Äôt work Foster noted that he had purchased a 1957 Plymouth Savoy as a donor car to replace needed parts to keep Miss Belvedere from further deterioration, and the initial offer was a promotional stunt for his business. It was hoped that the frame and trunk under body would be used from the Savoy to replace the weakened parts of the Miss Belvedere. However, after investing of more than $15,000, and after evaluating the condition of the frame and body, Mr. Foster halted further restoration efforts of the Miss Belvedere. The Miss Belvedere stayed in Ultra One's warehouse for ten years, while a permanent display location was sought. = Search for a permanent site = After the stabilization work on Miss Belvedere was completed, the city of Tulsa was approached and offered the chance to have the car returned as part of a permanent display. The offer was refused by the city, as was an offer to the Smithsonian Museum. Foster stated that he hoped to find another museum that would accept Miss Belvedere for display. In 2015, Dwight Foster announced that Miss Belvedere would be permanently displayed at the Historic Auto Attractions Museum in Roscoe, Illinois.Covington, Hannah. \\"A grand old dame': Miss Belvedere heads to new home,\\" Tulsa World, June 22, 2015. Accessed June 22, 2015. Wayne Lensing, owner of the Historic Auto Attractions Museum, stated that he hoped the exhibit would be open by 2016. In June 2017, it was reported that the Miss Belvedere had been shipped to the museum, where the owner is currently working on preparing the exhibit and getting the car and facility ready to display. The display is expected to feature both the Miss Belvedere and the events surrounding her story.

Life He was the son of Bonnell Thornton and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge. Inspired by John Martyn's lectures on botany and the work of Linnaeus he switched from the church to medicine. He worked at Guy's Hospital in London, where he later lectured in medical botany. After spending some time abroad, he settled and practised in London. Robert inherited the family fortune after the death of both his brother and mother. Thornton died in destitution. Works In 1799 Thornton commenced his work on the New Illustration of the Sexual System of Carolus von Linnaeus a work of botanical science to be published in three parts. The first was a dissertation on the sex of plants according to the Swedish scientist, Carolus von Linnaeus and the second an exposition of the sexual system.The most ambitious part of the New Illustration of the Sexual System of Carolus Linn√¶us was Part III, the Temple of Flora (1799-1807). The first plates were engraved by Thomas Medland in May 1798, from paintings by Philip Reinagle. Between 1798 and 1807, they produced a total of thirty-three coloured plates, engraved in aquatint, stipple and line engraving. When he planned the project, Thornton had decided to publish seventy folio-size plates. Lack of interest from the general public spelled disaster for the scheme, and the holding of a lottery could not save it from financial ruin, neither did a page in the work dedicated to the spouse of George III, Queen Charlotte, patroness of botany and the fine arts. It is estimated that around 800 copies were produced, each containing 31 plates accompanied by inspirational poetry and explanatory notes covering flower lore and legend.

Distribution This nerite is endemic to the southern Pacific, including the south-eastern coast of Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands.. Habitat This species is commonly found on intertidal rocks, particularly in the mid to upper intertidal zone. It prefers to attach to sloped or vertical rock surfaces, or hang from the underside of rocks. This may be a method of thermoregulation, because if N. atramentosa is on a horizontal surface, it would absorb the maximum solar radiation, whereas on sloped or vertical surfaces it absorbs less energy (and thus heat). A shell of Nerita melanotragus, underside view Shell description The shell is of moderate size, very solid, globose-oval, and smooth except for weak shallowly incised spiral lines. The external shell colour is black, but the aperture is white, except for a narrow black border. Once shells get over about 26mm they start to wear down and typically have knotched sides and a white wear on the right hand side of the shell. The operculum is granular, pinkish-lilac, with two spiral bands of black. The shell height is up to 30 mm, and width 32 mm.

Measuring 14 feet in length, the class was designed the 1960 and introduced at the Northbridge sailing club in Sydney, Australia, with control of the class transferred to the NS14 Association of New South Wales in 1965. Subsequently the boat was introduced to the other states, prior to being taken to New Zealand in 1995 and the United States in 1998. Designed around the New Zealand Javelin dinghy (Australasia) hull, the boat was designed to be a high performance class for family sailing. The class has neither a trapeze nor spinnaker, which allows it to be easily handled by both novice and family crews. The NS14 class is commonly sailed by family crews with combinations of two adults or an adult and child both common. The limited sail area generally keeps loads low and this gives a wide range of crews an ability to compete against one another. The development nature of the class has allowed it to significantly evolve since inception and it is capable of performing well against other classes with greater sail area or more righting moment. Crews are able to modify their boats to suit their particular circumstances and crew weight and to incorporate innovative new ideas where allowed by the class rules. Rig Development The NS14 was one of the pioneers of the use of wing masts on small sailing dinghies. The modest sail area limit required designers to push for efficient high power, low drag rigs and this was achieved through the use of a rotating wing mast. Early masts were made of wood while later aluminium and then carbon masts gave lighter and lighter options. Along with the wing mast section, NS14‚Äôs have used fully battened large roached mainsails to push the available sail area higher to capture the benefit of stronger winds aloft. The use of full length battens allows a large roach and gives excellent control over the sail profile. Hull Development NS14 hull design has significantly evolved from its initial form. Box rule limitations ensure that the designs are all comparable but allow significant scope for design development. Designers such as Michael Nash and more recently Stuart Freizer released multiple designs through their long association with the class which have resulted in incrementally faster hull shapes. Hull designs have progressed toward U-shaped sections forward with significant flat sections to maximise lift while keeping waterlines as narrow as class beam requirements allow. The class rules allow a relatively beamy hull which maximises the righting moment achievable from two crew hiking. Self-draining cockpits are the norm and allow the boats to quickly recover after a capsize. Rudder and centerboard design are open and take high aspect, low drag shapes. References 3\\\\.

It is very closely related to the Florida stone crab, Menippe mercenaria, of which it is sometimes considered to be a subspecies. Description Stone crabs have a hard exoskeleton shell which is brownish red with gray spots on top but a tan underside. They have two large and unequally-sized chelae (claws), which have black tips. The stone crab's carapace, or main shell, is and nearly wide. The males have a smaller carapace than females of a similar age, but males generally have larger chelae than females. Range The geographic range of M. adina overlaps with that of M. mercenaria, extending from Wakulla County, Florida around the Gulf of Mexico to Tamaulipas state, Mexico. Fishery Stone crabs are typically found feeding near jetties, oyster reefs, or other rocky areas, as well as in marshes, such as where blue crabs are, and can be caught with line or in traps. In most jurisdictions, only the right (usually crusher) claw of the Gulf Coast stone crab can be retained, which will regrow, and the crab is returned live to the spot from which it was harvested. The claw must be at least , as measured from the tip claw to the first joint beyond the moveable claw.

Dime divides into at least two dialects, which include Us'a and Gerfa. It has six case suffixes in addition to an unmarked nominative. It is overwhelmingly suffixing, but uses prefixes for demonstratives and reduplication. Phonologically, it is noteworthy among the Omotic languages for having velar and uvular fricative phonemes. The basic word order is SOV (subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb), as in other Omotic languages, indeed as in all the languages of the core of the Ethiopian Language Area. The language, as well as the Dime people themselves, reportedly decreased in numbers over the 20th century due to predation from their neighbors the Bodi, and both are in danger of extinction. According to Ethiopian census figures, the 1994 census reported 6293 speakers of the Dime language in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region alone;1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, Vol. 1, part 1, Table 2.14 in the 2007 census, only 574 speakers were reported for all of Ethiopia. Further, because the Dime language still lacks a writing system and there are no local schools to promote the use of the language, it is even more threatened.

The first English translation of Mein Kampf was an abridgment by Edgar Dugdale, who started work on it in 1931, at the prompting of his wife Blanche. When he learned that the London publishing firm of Hurst & Blackett had secured the rights to publish an abridgment in the United Kingdom, he offered it gratis in April 1933.

It premiered on the Fox network on March 7, 1999. The episode was written by Daniel Arkin and directed by Michael Watkins. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Arcadia\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.5, being watched by 17.91 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive critical reception, with many reviewers praising the episode's humor. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, several disappearances at an idyllic planned community lead Mulder and Scully to go undercover as a married couple. They find that the members of the community strictly abide by every single subdivision rule, no matter how inconsequential a rule may seem. What Mulder and Scully soon discover is that the ruler of this small community has enforced his rule with a Tulpa creature from Tibet. Arkin, a first-year staff writer for the show, was inspired to write the episode based on an incident in his life that involved a planned community. The episode heavily utilized special effects, with various make-up and digital effects inserted into the final film to give the episode an appropriate feel. Plot At the Falls of Arcadia, a fictional planned community in San Diego County, California, disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives at home to find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a tacky whirligig, which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While in bed that night, Kline hears an intruder in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays in bed. A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate the Klines' disappearance, going undercover as new homeowners under the aliases Rob and Laura Petrie. As Mulder and Scully are moving into the Klines' former home, neighbor Win Shroeder nervously tucks away Mulder's basketball hoop into the garage, telling him that it is against the community's CC&Rs.; Settling in, the agents begin searching the house and find what appears to be blood on a blade of the ceiling fan. When Big Mike, another neighbor, wants to let the \\"Petries\\" in on the \\"consequences\\" of breaking the CC&Rs;, homeowner association president Gene Gogolak describes him as \\"a weak link\\" to be dealt with. That night, Big Mike disappears after being attacked by the creature. While taking a walk, Scully later finds the Schroeder's dog Scruffy and Big Mike's necklace in a storm drain. Scruffy's face is covered in a substance that looks like blood. Mulder and Scully discuss possible motives for the Klines' presumed murders, and Scully decides to have the substances analyzed in San Diego. Mulder decides to test his theories that noncompliance with the CC&Rs; is the motive by sticking a plastic flamingo in the yard and damaging the mailbox, among other antics. Mulder later finds a note in the mailbox that says, \\"Be like the others... before it gets dark\\". After dark, Mulder brings out his basketball hoop, and Shroeder runs over to frantically argue with Mulder to put it away. Meanwhile, something comes out of the grass at Mrs. Shroeder, who screams. Mulder chases it away, but they all notice their light has burned out. Shroeder confronts Gogolak, accusing him of trying to kill his family. Instead Schroeder is told \\"Rob Petrie\\" is the real problem. Meanwhile, Mulder believes the creature that kills the homeowners moves through the yard, under the grass. Scully shares her lab results: the \\"blood\\" on the ceiling fan and on the dog is actually grime, as the neighborhood is built on top of an old landfill. Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their front yard, so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig it up, telling the neighbors he's putting in a reflecting pool, which is not against the CC&Rs.; They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company. As Scully calls for a forensic team to come out there immediately, she hears something in the house. She goes for her gun in the dresser drawer, but finds it missing. As the creature comes up the stairs, a bloodied Big Mike grabs Scully and tells her to get out, that \\"it's coming\\" for her. He shoves Scully in the closet, and fights with the creature. Meanwhile, Mulder confronts Gogolak about marking the Klines for death by giving them the tacky windmill. Mulder says the creature is a tulpa, a Tibetan thoughtform, that Gogolak conjured to assure compliance with the CC&Rs.; Mulder arrests him, handcuffs him to a mailbox, and goes to find Scully. Cuffed to the mailbox, Gogolak begs for help, knowing the creature is coming. The creature attacks Gogolak and, as he dies, it disintegrates into dirt. Scully comes outside too late to see the creature, the remnants of which are at Mulder's feet. Production \\"Arcadia\\" was inspired by life in planned communities. =Inspiration and writing= Daniel Arkin, a first-year staff writer for the show, was inspired to write \\"Arcadia\\" based on an incident that had occurred several years prior: In 1991, he had moved into an \\"uptight planned communit[y]\\" in Greenwich Village. Unfortunately, his movers showed up late, forcing him to begin unloading his belongings in the later part of the evening. Because Arkin had neglected to read the community's \\"three hundred page\\"-long covenants, conditions, and restrictions, he was later shocked to discover that the complex had fined him one thousand dollars for moving in after the approved hours. The incident stuck in Arkin's mind, and when he was tasked with writing a story for The X-Files, he immediately jumped to the \\"frightening\\" reality of planned communities. The story went through many variations, and when Arkin wrote his first draft, the main antagonist was simply a man who served as a metaphorical \\"bogeyman.\\" After series creator Chris Carter suggested that Arkin replace the human with an actual monster, he quickly re-wrote his story to include elements of the Tulpa myth. The idea to \\"marry\\" Mulder and Scully came from a writers meeting, as everyone felt it would be a convincing way for Mulder and Scully to go undercover. =Casting and design= Abraham Benrubi, noted at the time for his work as Jerry Markovic on the NBC hospital drama ER, was cast by Rick Millikan to play Big Mike. The NBC production staff was hesitant to allow him to appear on the show, given his tight production schedule, but, as Millikan later explained, \\"there was a small window‚Äîhe had a few days off‚Äîand we were able to squeeze him in there.\\" Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf, the make-up department head for The X-Files, was responsible for making Benrubi appear mauled and bloody. Applying the necessary makeup and prosthetics took four hours, and Benrubi wore his makeup for almost twelve hours straight. Costume designer Christine Peters was tasked with designing the outfits for Mulder and Scully. Mulder's outfit was composed largely of \\"Lacoste Izod alligator shirts, Dockers, Bass Weejuns,\\" and Scully's outfit was \\"jeans and a sweatshirt [or] khakis and sneakers.\\" Peters noted that Scully's outfit was harder to design because Scully's character has \\"a 'look' that she doesn't want to give up.\\"Meisler, p. 169 =Effects= The show's production crew had a difficult time designing the monster, which later earned a variety of colorful nicknames courtesy of the show's production staff, including \\"Gumby on Steroids,\\" \\"Mr. Butterworth,\\" \\"Fecal Fred,\\" and \\"The Shit Monster.\\".Meisler, p. 168 Assistant director Bruce Carter explained that the two choices were either to make a creature that \\"has grown muscle and sinew through the force of Gene Gogolak's personality\\", or make a more conventional garbage creature covered in \\"banana peels and coffee grounds.\\" Makeup supervisor John Vulich eventually designed a monster outfit that was, effectively, a \\"foam rubber suit\\" made out of urethane. Shredded rubber was then attached to the suit, which was then submerged in \\"gunk\\" to create the garbage effect. Despite all this work, the final episode does not contain many shots of the monster, as most of its scenes were cut during the editing phase. Digital effects supervisor Bill Millar was tasked to edit Scully's \\"evidence video\\". He explained that \\"they wanted Scully's point of view rather than the Handicam's point of view.\\" Unfortunately, he was given the film the Friday before the episode aired. The complete special effects for just this short video required roughly six hours to complete. Reception =Ratings= \\"Arcadia\\" premiered on the Fox network on March 7, 1999\\\\. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.5, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 10.5 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 17.91 million viewers.Meisler, p. 294 The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on June 20, 1999, and received 1.02 million viewers, making it the most watched episode that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 14‚Äì20, 1999\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Mulder and Scully married! This could be the scariest 'X-Files' ever!\\" =Reviews= \\"Arcadia\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named \\"Arcadia\\" the tenth funniest X-Files episode and noted the two levels of humor in the episode‚Äîthe \\"blatantly hilarious\\" pairing of Mulder and Scully as husband and wife, and the \\"perfect parody\\" of the planned community way of life. Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! News named \\"The Arcadia Garbage Monster\\" as one of \\"The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five and noted that the inherent draw of the episode was \\"seeing Mulder and Scully go under-cover as a yuppie married couple.\\"Shearman and Pearson, pp. 180‚Äì181 Despite the general praise for the episode, however, the two slightly criticized the ending, calling the final scene \\"rushed.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\" and called it \\"a solid example of the show‚Äôs mid-period form\\". However, she noted that the episode is not one of the series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it‚Äîdue largely to the fact that \\"it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple\\"‚Äîand that \\"the episode‚Äôs monster is a little hard to figure out\\". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6‚Äì9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing \\"after watching 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect.\\"Kessenich, p. 43 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he \\"rebels against the rules\\", called the episode's main villains \\"stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites.\\" In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan- selected episodes, \\"Arcadia\\" was presented as the \\"Best Mulder/Scully Chemistry\\".

Braak was born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, and studied medicine at the universities of Hamburg, Berlin, and Kiel. He was Professor at the Institute of Clinical Neuroanatomy, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main. Currently he is based at the 'Clinical Neuroanatomy Section, Department of Neurology, Center for Biomedical Research, University of Ulm, Germany.{{Braak H, Ludolph AC, Neumann M, Ravits J, Del Tredici K.

Braak's early research focused on the morphology of the central nervous system of chondrichthyan fishes. In the holocephalan species Chimaera monstrosa (ratfish), he described, in the basal midline of the diencephalon, a previously unknown ependymall structure adjacent to the rostral part of the optic chiasma referred to as the ‚Äòorganon vasculare praeopticum‚Äô. It may be considered homologous to the supraoptic crest of mammals.Kuhlenbeck H. (1977). The central nervous system of vertebrates. Vol. 5, Part I, p. 89. Karger, Basel. Braak also described the morphology of the neurohypophysial complex of the squaliform elasmobranch Etmopterus spinax (Spinax niger). Braak‚Äôs further research has focused on the morphology and pathoanatomy of the human central nervous system, in particular of the cerebral cortex (1980). Braak has also contributed extensively to the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In particular, he and his wife Eva Braak introduced a classification of Alzheimer's disease into six distinct pathoanatomical stages, now commonly referred to as Braak and Braak stages, based on the topographical distribution pattern of neurofibrillary changes from circumscribed parts of the limbic system to the higher neocortical association fields. A similar classification was proposed in 2003 for the pathoanatomical changes associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Braak and his wife, Eva Braak, were the first to describe the pathological changes of argyrophilic grain disease, a previously unknown form of senile dementia. in 2007, Braak and co-authors advanced a ‚Äòdual-hit hypothesis‚Äô about the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, according to which an unknown pathogen akin to a slow-virus may enter the nervous system through both the nasal and intestinal mucosae, eventually resulting in a cascade of neurodegenerative events in the brain. Braak is the son of the philologist Professor Ivo Braak (1906‚Äì1991) and brother of theatre director Dr. Kai Braak.

Biography After graduating from school in Pforzheim, Dietrich first attended the technical university in Karlsruhe, before moving to music. He studied from 1925 in Freiburg with Wilibald Gurlitt and Heinrich Besseler. Later study saw him move to the University of Heidelberg, to where Besseler had moved. For a short time, Dietrich studied in Leipzig at the conservatory, under Karl Straube. From 1931 to 1934, Dietrich took a music assistantship in Heidelberg, whilst training to teach at university level. This he did in 1935, but with the Nazi regime strengthening its grip on the German society, working opportunities for music teachers dwindled. Between 1935 and 1944 Dietrich worked for the B√§renreiter publishing house in Kassel,Online version in Kerkmusicus Hans Jansen. and himself published a collection of small notebooks with music for laymen. He was conscripted into the army, and in January 1945 went missing on the Eastern front in the area around Heiligenbeil (now Mamonovo in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia) at the start of the East Prussian Offensive by the Red Army.

In 2014, the company, located in Altdorf near Nuremberg, Germany had approximately 208 million EUR in sales with 1,720 employees. Company history 1951 SUSPA Suspension Technology GmbH was inaugurated and manufactured spring struts for two-wheel vehicles. 1959 SUSPA develops a damping system for washing machines which ends the irritating \\"bouncing\\". Just three years later SUSPA is the market leader. The first products for the automobile industry are gas springs for opening and closing of tailgates in 1964. 1969 SUSPA develops a height adjustment system and a positioning system for backrests of office chairs.1973‚Äì1978 SUSPA expands in Europe, Asia and America; SUSPA develops silicone-damped impact absorbers for automobiles. 1988 SUSPA diversifies to a three-component water paint system and thus protects the environment by abstaining from using solvents and amines. 1991 SUSPA develops height adjustment systems for tables and work surfaces. 1994 a new business is founded in India. The mass production of spoiler adjustment systems begins in 1999 and SUSPA becomes a system supplier for the automotive industry. One year later SUSPA produces its first crash management system and opens an assembly plant in the Czech Republic. In 2003 the production capacities in Asia are expanded. Steadily increasing price competition in the world market coupled with heavily increased material costs forces SUSPA in 2008 to stop manufacturing gas springs for chairs and to focus more on the core business (Automotive and Industry). In June 2009 the company Tyrol Equity from Austria purchases 80 per cent of the company shares. In June 2012 the Tyrolean Industry Holding sells their SUSPA shares to the private investor group Andlinger & Company GmbH. Company Structure The company is divided into two divisions, with the business segments Mechanical Applications, Crash Management, Household Applications and Powered Applications.

In addition to atmospheric pollution, coal burning produces hundreds of millions of tons of solid waste products annually, including fly ash,RadTown USA US EPA bottom ash, and flue-gas desulfurization sludge, that contain mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic, and other heavy metals. Coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere. There are severe health effects caused by burning coal. According to a report by the World Health Organization in 2008, coal particulates pollution are estimated to shorten approximately 10,000 lives annually worldwide. A 2004 study commissioned by environmental groups, but contested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, concluded that coal burning costs 24,000 lives a year in the United States. More recently, an academic study estimated that the premature deaths from coal related air pollution was about 52,000.Caiazzo, F., Ashok, A., Waitz, I.A., Yim, S.H. and Barrett, S.R., 2013. Air pollution and early deaths in the United States. Part I: Quantifying the impact of major sectors in 2005. Atmospheric Environment, 79, pp.198‚Äì208. When compared to electricity produced from natural gas via hydraulic fracturing, coal electricity is 10‚Äì100 times more toxic, largely due to the amount of particulate matter emitted during combustion. When coal is compared to solar photovoltaic generation, the latter could save 51,999 American lives per year if solar were to replace coal-based energy generation in the U.S.USA Today. The US could prevent a lot of deaths by switching from coal to solar https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/2017/06/01/-us-could-prevent-lot-deaths- switching-coal-solar/102405132/ Due to the decline of jobs related to coal mining a study found that approximately one American suffers a premature death from coal pollution for every job remaining in coal mining. In addition, the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one, although work related coal deaths has declined substantially as safety measures have been enacted and underground mining has given up market share to surface mining. Underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Open cut hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the United States, an average of 26 coal miners per year died in the decade 2005‚Äì2014.  Land use management  = Impact to land and surroundings = Strip mining severely alters the landscape, which reduces the value of the natural environment in the surrounding land. The land surface is dedicated to mining activities until it can be reshaped and reclaimed. If mining is allowed, resident human populations must be resettled off the mine site; economic activities, such as agriculture or hunting and gathering food and medicinal plants are interrupted. What becomes of the land surface after mining is determined by the manner in which the mining is conducted. Usually reclamation of disturbed lands to a land use condition is not equal to the original use. Existing land uses (such as livestock grazing, crop and timber production) are temporarily eliminated in mining areas. High- value, intensive-land-use areas like urban and transportation systems are not usually affected by mining operations. If mineral values are sufficient, these improvements may be removed to an adjacent area. Strip mining eliminates existing vegetation, destroys the genetic soil profile, displaces or destroys wildlife and habitat, alters current land uses, and to some extent permanently changes the general topography of the area mined.U.S. Department of the Interior. 1979. Permanent Regulatory Program Implementing Section 01(b) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977: Environmental Impact Statement. Washington, D.C. Adverse impacts on geological features of human interest may occur in a coal strip mine. Geomorphic and geophysical features and outstanding scenic resources may be sacrificed by indiscriminate mining. Paleontological, cultural, and other historic values may be endangered due to the disruptive activities of blasting, ripping, and excavating coal. Stripping of overburden eliminates and destroys archeological and historic features, unless they are removed beforehand.Squillace, Mark. The Strip Mining Handbook: A Coalfield Citizens' Guide To Using The Law To Fight Back Against The Ravages Of Strip Mining And Underground Mining, Washington, D.C.: Environmental Policy Institute, Friends of the Earth, 1990.United States Department of the Interior. Coal: Construction and Mining Impacts , Washington, D.C.: Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development, Tribal Energy and Environmental Information Clearinghouse (TEEIC). Retrieved 9 March 2012. The removal of vegetative cover and activities associated with the construction of haul roads, stockpiling of topsoil, displacement of overburden and hauling of soil and coal increase the quantity of dust around mining operations. Dust degrades air quality in the immediate area, has an adverse impact on vegetative life, and constitutes health and safety hazards for mine workers and nearby residents. Surface mining disrupts virtually all aesthetic elements of the landscape. Alteration of land forms often imposes unfamiliar and discontinuous configurations. New linear patterns appear as material is extracted and waste piles are developed. Different colors and textures are exposed as vegetative cover is removed and overburden dumped to the side. Dust, vibration, and diesel exhaust odors are created (affecting sight, sound, and smell). Residents of local communities often find such impacts disturbing or unpleasant. In case of mountaintop removal, tops are removed from mountains or hills to expose thick coal seams underneath. The soil and rock removed is deposited in nearby valleys, hollows and depressions, resulting in blocked (and contaminated) waterways. Removal of soil and rock overburden covering the coal resource may cause burial and loss of topsoil, exposes parent material, and creates large infertile wastelands. Soil disturbance and associated compaction result in conditions conducive to erosion. Soil removal from the area to be surface-mined alters or destroys many natural soil characteristics, and reduces its biodiversity and productivity for agriculture. Soil structure may be disturbed by pulverization or aggregate breakdown. Mine collapses (or mine subsidences) have the potential to produce major effects above ground, which are especially devastating in developed areas. German underground coal- mining (especially in North Rhine-Westphalia) has damaged thousands of houses, and the coal-mining industries have set aside large sums in funding for future subsidence damages as part of their insurance and state-subsidy schemes. In a particularly spectacular case in the German Saar region (another historical coal-mining area), a suspected mine collapse in 2008 created an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, causing some damage to houses. Previously, smaller earthquakes had become increasingly common and coal mining was temporarily suspended in the area. In response to negative land effects of coal mining and the abundance of abandoned mines in the US the federal government enacted the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which requires reclamation plans for future coal mining sites. These plans must be approved by federal or state authorities before mining begins.  Water management  Surface mining may impair groundwater in numerous ways: by drainage of usable water from shallow aquifers; lowering of water levels in adjacent areas and changes in flow direction within aquifers; contamination of usable aquifers below mining operations due to infiltration (percolation) of poor-quality mine water; and increased infiltration of precipitation on spoil piles. Where coal or carbonaceous shale is present, increased infiltration may result in: increased runoff of poor-quality water and erosion from spoil piles, recharge of poor-quality water to shallow groundwater aquifers and poor-quality water flow to nearby streams. The contamination of both groundwater and nearby streams may be for long periods of time. Deterioration of stream quality results from acid mine drainage, toxic trace elements, high content of dissolved solids in mine drainage water, and increased sediment loads discharged to streams. When coal surfaces are exposed, pyrite comes in contact with water and air and forms sulfuric acid. As water drains from the mine, the acid moves into the waterways; as long as rain falls on the mine tailings the sulfuric-acid production continues, whether the mine is still operating or not. Also waste piles and coal storage piles can yield sediment to streams. Surface waters may be rendered unfit for agriculture, human consumption, bathing, or other household uses. To anticipate these problems, water is monitored at coal mines. The five principal technologies used to control water flow at mine sites are: diversion systems, ash ponds (surface impoundments), groundwater pumping systems, subsurface drainage systems, and subsurface barriers. In the United States, due to few federal and state regulations concerning ash ponds, most power plants do not use geomembranes, leachate collection systems, or other flow controls often found in municipal solid waste landfills. More stringent U.S. regulations for ash ponds and landfills are pending as of 2020. =River water pollution= Coal-fired boilers, using either coal or lignite rich in limestone, produces fly ash containing calcium oxide (CaO). CaO readily dissolves in water to form slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) which is carried by rainwater to rivers/irrigation water from the ash dump areas. Lime softening process precipitates Ca and Mg ions / removes temporary hardness in the water and also converts sodium bicarbonates in river water into sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate (washing soda) further reacts with the remaining Ca and Mg in the water to remove / precipitate the total hardness. Also, water-soluble sodium salts present in the ash enhance the sodium content in water further. Thus river water is converted into soft water by eliminating Ca and Mg ions and enhancing Na ions by coal-fired boilers. Soft water application in irrigation (surface or ground water) converts the fertile soils into alkaline sodic soils.Managing irrigation water quality, Oregon State University, US, Retrieved on 4 October 2012. River water alkalinity and sodicity due to the accumulation of salts in the remaining water after meeting various transpiration and evaporation losses, become acute when many coal-fired boilers and power stations are installed in a river basin. River water sodicity affects downstream cultivated river basins located in China, India, Egypt, Pakistan, west Asia, Australia, western US, etc. Pollutant discharges from ash ponds to rivers (or other surface water bodies) typically include arsenic, lead, mercury, selenium, chromium, and cadmium. = Waste management = Aerial photograph of alt=Aerial photo of pollution caused by leaking sludge storage pond The burning of coal leaves substantial quantities of fly ash, which is usually stored in ash ponds (wet storage) or landfills (dry storage). Pollutants such as heavy metals leach into groundwater from unlined ponds or landfills, and can pollute aquifers for decades or centuries. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified 44 sites as potential hazards to communities (which means the waste sites could cause death and significant property damage if an event such as a storm, a terrorist attack or a structural failure caused a spill). EPA estimated that about 300 dry landfills and wet storage ponds are used around the country to store ash from coal-fired power plants. The storage facilities hold the noncombustible ingredients of coal, including the ash captured by equipment designed to reduce air pollution.Associated Press ‚Äì June 2009 In the low-coal-content areas waste forms spoil tip. = Wildlife = Surface mining of coal causes direct and indirect damage to wildlife. The impact on wildlife stems primarily from disturbing, removing and redistributing the land surface. Some impacts are short-term and confined to the mine site however others have far-reaching, long-term effects. The most direct effect on wildlife is destruction or displacement of species in areas of excavation and spoil piling. Pit and spoil areas are not capable of providing food and cover for most species of wildlife. Mobile wildlife species like game animals, birds, and predators leave these areas. More sedentary animals like invertebrates, reptiles, burrowing rodents, and small mammals may be destroyed. The community of microorganisms and nutrient-cycling processes are upset by movement, storage, and redistribution of soil. Degradation of aquatic habitats is a major impact by surface mining and may be apparent many miles from a mining site. Sediment contamination of surface water is common with surface mining. Sediment yields may increase a thousand times their former level as a result of strip mining.Permanent Regulatory Program Implementing Section 501(b) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The effects of sediment on aquatic wildlife vary with the species and the amount of contamination. High sediment levels can kill fish directly, bury spawning beds, reduce light transmission, alter temperature gradients, fill in pools, spread streamflows over wider, shallower areas, and reduce the production of aquatic organisms used as food by other species. These changes destroy the habitat of valued species and may enhance habitat for less-desirable species. Existing conditions are already marginal for some freshwater fish in the United States, and the sedimentation of their habitat may result in their extinction. The heaviest sediment pollution of drainage normally comes within 5 to 25 years after mining. In some areas, unvegetated spoil piles continue to erode even 50 to 65 years after mining. The presence of acid-forming materials exposed as a result of surface mining can affect wildlife by eliminating habitat and by causing direct destruction of some species. Lesser concentrations can suppress productivity, growth rate and reproduction of many aquatic species. Acids, dilute concentrations of heavy metals, and high alkalinity can cause severe damage to wildlife in some areas. The duration of acidic-waste pollution can be long; estimates of the time required to leach exposed acidic materials in the Eastern United States range from 800 to 3,000 years.  Air pollution  = Air emissions = Coal and coal waste products (including fly ash, bottom ash and boiler slag) release approximately 20 toxic-release chemicals, including arsenic, lead, mercury, nickel, vanadium, beryllium, cadmium, barium, chromium, copper, molybdenum, zinc, selenium and radium, which are dangerous if released into the environment. While these substances are trace impurities, enough coal is burned that significant amounts of these substances are released. The Mpumalanga highveld in South Africa is the most polluted area in the world due to the mining industry and coal plant power stations and the lowveld near the famous Kruger Park is under threat of new mine projects as well. Illustration of air pollutants generated by U.S. power plants (includes both coal-fired and oil-fired plants). During combustion, the reaction between coal and the air produces oxides of carbon, including carbon dioxide (CO2, an important greenhouse gas), oxides of sulfur (mainly sulfur dioxide, SO2), and various oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Because of the hydrogenous and nitrogenous components of coal, hydrides and nitrides of carbon and sulfur are also produced during the combustion of coal in air. These include hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sulfur nitrate (SNO3) and other toxic substances. SO2 and nitrogen oxide react in the atmosphere to form fine particles and ground-level ozone and are transported long distances, making it difficult for other states to achieve healthy levels of pollution control. The wet cooling towers used in coal-fired power stations, etc. emit drift and fog which are also an environmental concern. The drift contains Respirable suspended particulate matter. In case of cooling towers with sea water makeup, sodium salts are deposited on nearby lands which would convert the land into alkali soil, reducing the fertility of vegetative lands and also cause corrosion of nearby structures. Fires sometimes occur in coal beds underground. When coal beds are exposed, the fire risk is increased. Weathered coal can also increase ground temperatures if it is left on the surface. Almost all fires in solid coal are ignited by surface fires caused by people or lightning. Spontaneous combustion is caused when coal oxidizes and airflow is insufficient to dissipate heat; this more commonly occurs in stockpiles and waste piles, rarely in bedded coal underground. Where coal fires occur, there is attendant air pollution from emission of smoke and noxious fumes into the atmosphere. Coal seam fires may burn underground for decades, threatening destruction of forests, homes, roadways and other valuable infrastructure. The best-known coal-seam fire may be the one which led to the permanent evacuation of Centralia, Pennsylvania, United States.DeKok, David, Unseen Danger: A Tragedy of People, Government and the Centralia Mine Fire. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986. . Approximately 75 Tg/S per year of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is released from burning coal. After release, the Sulfur Dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H2SO2 which scatters solar radiation, hence their increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate that masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. Release of SO2 also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems.Human Impacts on Atmospheric Chemistry, by PJ Crutzen and J Lelieveld, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Vol. 29: 17 -45 (Volume publication date May 2001) = Mercury emissions = In 2011 U.S. power plants emitted half of the nation's mercury air pollutants. In February 2012, EPA issued the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) regulation, which requires all coal-fired plants to substantially reduce mercury emissions.EPA. (2012-02-16). \\"National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel- Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units.\\" Final rule. Federal Register, In New York State winds deposit mercury from the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest, contaminating the waters of the Catskill Mountains. Mercury is concentrated up the food chain, as it is converted into methylmercury, a toxic compound which harms both wildlife and people who consume freshwater fish.NOAA: Atmospheric Mercury http://www.arl.noaa.gov/mercury.php NOAA: Atmospheric Mercury Modeling http://www.arl.noaa.gov/Mercury_modeling.php The mercury is consumed by worms, which are eaten by fish, which are eaten by birds (including bald eagles).

Ocean fish account for the majority of human exposure to methylmercury; the full range of sources of methylmercury in ocean fish is not well understood. = Annual excess mortality and morbidity = In 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations calculated that coal particulates pollution cause approximately one million deaths annually across the world,Deaths per TWH by Energy Source , Next Big Future, March 2011. Quote: \\"The World Health Organization and other sources attribute about 1 million deaths/year to coal air pollution.\\" which is approximately one third of all premature deaths related to all air pollution sources,Shrader- Frechette, Kristin. What Will Work: Fighting Climate Change with Renewable Energy, Not Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, 2011, pg.9, . for example in Istanbul by lung diseases and cancer. Pollutants emitted by burning coal include fine particulates (PM2.5) and ground level ozone. Every year, the burning of coal without the use of available pollution control technology causes thousands of preventable deaths in the United States. A study commissioned by the Maryland nurses association in 2006 found that emissions from just six of Maryland's coal-burning plants caused 700 deaths per year nationwide, including 100 in Maryland.A Coal-Fired Plant That Is Eager for U.S. Rules by Matthew L. Wald, published 5 January 2012. Since installation of pollution abatement equipment on one of these six, the Brandon Shores plant, now \\"produces 90 percent less nitrogen oxide, an ingredient of smog; 95 percent less sulfur, which causes acid rain; and vastly lower fractions of other pollutants.\\" =Economic costs= A 2001 EU-funded study known as ExternE, or Externalities of Energy, over the decade from 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal would double over its present value, if external costs were taken into account. These external costs include damage to the environment and to human health from airborne particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, chromium VI and arsenic emissions produced by coal. It was estimated that external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1‚Äì2% of the EU's entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with coal being the main fossil fuel accountable, and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included.New research reveals the real costs of electricity in Europe (press release), EC, Research Directorate- General, 25 July 2001 The study found that environmental and health costs of coal alone were ‚Ç¨0.06/kWh, or 6 cents/kWh, with the energy sources of the lowest external costs being nuclear power ‚Ç¨0.0019/kWh, and wind power at ‚Ç¨0.0009/kWh.ExternE-Pol, External costs of current and advanced electricity systems, associated with emissions from the operation of power plants and with the rest of the energy chain, final technical report. 2006, See figure 9, 9b and figure 11 High rates of motherboard failures in China and India appear to be due to \\"sulfurous air pollution produced by coal that‚Äôs burned to generate electricity. It corrodes the copper circuitry,\\" according to Intel researchers.  Greenhouse gas emissions  The combustion of coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. Electric generation using coal burning produces approximately twice the greenhouse gasses per kilowatt compared to generation using natural gas. Coal mining releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is the naturally occurring product of the decay of organic matter as coal deposits are formed with increasing depths of burial, rising temperatures, and rising pressure over geological time. A portion of the methane produced is absorbed by the coal and later released from the coal seam (and surrounding disturbed strata) during the mining process. Methane accounts for 10.5 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions created through human activity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has a global warming potential 21 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year timeline. The process of mining can release pockets of methane. These gases may pose a threat to coal miners, as well as a source of air pollution. This is due to the relaxation of pressure and fracturing of the strata during mining activity, which gives rise to safety concerns for the coal miners if not managed properly. The buildup of pressure in the strata can lead to explosions during (or after) the mining process if prevention methods, such as \\"methane draining\\", are not taken. In 2008 James E. Hansen and Pushker Kharecha published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric CO2 levels. Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO2 peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO2 peaks at 422‚Äì446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter.  Radiation exposure  Coal also contains low levels of uranium, thorium, and other naturally occurring radioactive isotopes which, if released into the environment, may lead to radioactive contamination. Coal plants emit radiation in the form of radioactive fly ash, which is inhaled and ingested by neighbours, and incorporated into crops. A 1978 paper from Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated that coal-fired power plants of that time may contribute a whole-body committed dose of 19 ¬µSv/a to their immediate neighbours in a 500 m radius. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation's 1988 report estimated the committed dose 1 km away to be 20 ¬µSv/a for older plants or 1 ¬µSv/a for newer plants with improved fly ash capture, but was unable to confirm these numbers by test. Excluding contained waste and unintentional releases from nuclear plants, coal-plants carry more radioactive wastes into the environment than nuclear plants per unit of produced energy. Plant-emitted radiation carried by coal-derived fly ash delivers 100 times more radiation to the surrounding environment than does the normal operation of a similarly productive nuclear plant.Hvistendahl, Mara. \\"Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste: Scientific American\\", Scientific American, Nature America, Inc., 13 December 2007. Web. 18 March 2011. This comparison does not consider the rest of the fuel cycle, i.e., coal and uranium mining and refining and waste disposal. The operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/ORNL%20Review%20v26n3-4%201993.pdf pg28 Dangers to miners Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity, and the list of historical coal mining disasters is long. The principal hazards are mine wall failures and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Chronic lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black lung) were once common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy. In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers).Abelard.org, \\"Fossil fuel disasters\\". Rates may be higher than reported in some regions. In the United States, an average of 23 coal miners per year died in the decade 2007‚Äì2016. Recent U.S. coal- mining disasters include the Sago Mine disaster of January 2006. In 2007, a mine accident in Utah's Crandall Canyon Mine killed nine miners, with six entombed. The Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia killed 29 miners in April 2010. However, in lesser developed countries and some developing countries, many miners continue to die annually, either through direct accidents in coal mines or through adverse health consequences from working under poor conditions. China, in particular, has the highest number of coal mining related deaths in the world, with official statistics claiming that 6,027 deaths in 2004.Deconstructing deadly details from China's coal mine safety statistics CLB To compare, 28 deaths were reported in the US in the same year. Coal production in China is twice that in the US,World Coal Institute ‚Äì Coal Production while the number of coal miners is around 50 times that of the US, making deaths in coal mines in China 4 times as common per worker (108 times as common per unit output) as in the US. The Farmington coal mine disaster kills 78. West Virginia, US, 1968. Build-ups of a hazardous gas are known as damps:possibly from the German word \\"Dampf\\" which means steam or vapor * Black damp: a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in a mine can cause suffocation. The anoxic condition results of depletion of oxygen in enclosed spaces, e.g. by corrosion. * After damp: similar to black damp, after damp consists of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen and forms after a mine explosion. * Fire damp: consists of mostly methane, a highly flammable gas that explodes between 5% and 15% ‚Äì at 25% it causes asphyxiation. * Stink damp: so named for the rotten egg smell of the hydrogen sulphide gas, stink damp can explode and is also very toxic. * White damp: air containing carbon monoxide which is toxic, even at low concentrations'' Firedamp explosions can trigger the much more dangerous coal dust explosions, which can engulf an entire pit. Most of these risks can be greatly reduced in modern mines, and multiple fatality incidents are now rare in some parts of the developed world. Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per year due to mine accidents.OccupationalHazards.com. \\"Respiratory Protection in Coal Mines.\\"  See also  * Clean coal technology * Fossil fuel phase-out * Fossil fuel power station * Greenhouse gases * Health effects of atmospheric particulate matter * Ocean acidification  References   External links  * EPA fact sheet: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) * Bill Bigelow, \\"Got Coal?

Gurlitt, son of the art historian Cornelius Gurlitt, attended the St. Anne Semi-Classical Secondary School (Annenrealgymnasium) in Dresden and passed his maturity examination (Reifepr√ºfung) in 1908. He continued his studies at Heidelberg University and the University of Leipzig, predominantly philosophy and the history of civilization at first, but later chiefly music science, in particular the history of music in the 16th and 17th centuries.Autobiography of Wilibald Gurlitt (1914), translated by Nathaniel J. Biebert (Red Brick Parsonage, 2014). He began his practical training in music during his schooling in Dresden as a private student of Erdmann Warwas (violin) and Clemens Braun (theory), continued it in Heidelberg with Professor Philipp Wolfrum (counterpoint) and Karl Hasse (organ), and later on his own. He also received artistic advancement from Professor Karl Straube, organist at the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig.Autobiography (1914). From 1 April 1909 to 31 March 1910 he served in the 1st (Personal) Grenadier Regiment no. 100 in Dresden, and also attended evening lectures at the University of Technology (Technische Hochschule) there during the winter semester of 1909-1910.Autobiography (1914). During the summer semester of 1911 he took the graduate assistant position in the Collegium Musicum in Leipzig, in which he arranged and studied obscure music of the 17th century and also played violin.Autobiography (1914). From April to October 1912, he undertook an extensive study trip in order to gather material for his music history thesis. In 1914 he delivered his inaugural dissertation on Michael Praetorius under Hugo Riemann.Autobiography (1914). Later that year he was wounded near Sompuis on 9 September as Lieutenant of the Reserve in the aforementioned regiment, and was taken captive by the French on 10 September.\\"Michael Schulteis: Historical Background\\", translated by Nathaniel J. Biebert (Red Brick Parsonage, 2014). He was later released, finished his dissertation, and received his philosophical doctorate. In 1919 he became a lecturer in Freiburg, finally becoming professor in 1929. There he founded the musicology department and the Collegium Musicum which met in Karlsruhe and Hamburg for large public performances of medieval music. As a promoter of the Orgelbewegung (organ movement), he had the so-called 'Praetorius organ' built by master-organ-builder Oskar Walcker, based on 1619 designs by Praetorius. It was destroyed in 1944 in a bombing raid, but a large section of it was rebuilt by Werner Walcker-Mayer in the atrium of a new building at the University in 1955. Under National Socialism, Gurlitt was labelled a Jewish conspirator, and relieved, in 1937, of his office. He was re-employed after the war, however. From 1946-8 he was visiting professor at the University of Bern, and from 1955-6 at the University of Basel. In 1953 he was appointed to an honorary doctorate at the University of Leipzig.

About 3 hectares (7.5 acres) in size, with some 300 apartments in almost 100 houses, it is one of the largest remaining beguinages in the Low Countries. It stretches on both sides of the river Dijle, which splits into two canals inside the beguinage, thus forming an island. Three bridges connect the parts of the beguinage. The complete beguinage is owned by the University of Leuven and used as a campus, especially for housing academics. History Dyle in the Beguinage of Leuven The Groot Begijnhof has the appearance of a small town in the city. It is a succession of streets, squares, gardens and parks, with tens of houses and convents in traditional brick and sandstone style.\\"Groot Begijnhof\\", Stad Leuven As a community for unmarried, semi- religious women (see Beguine), this beguinage originated in the early 13th century. The oldest written documents date back from 1232. A Latin inscription on the church mentions 1234 as founding date. The community is presumably a few decades older. Local historians from the 16th century, including Justus Lipsius, mention 1205 as founding date. Just like other beguinages in Flanders, the beguinage in Leuven had a first golden age in the 13th century, and difficult times during the religious conflicts in the 16th century. One of the priests of this beguinage was Adriaan Florensz Boeyens, spiritual tutor of the infant Charles V and later known as Pope Adrian VI. From the end of the 16th century, and especially after the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621, the Beguinage had a second flourishing period, culminating near the last quarter of the 17th century and continuing afterwards, albeit in a gradual decline, until the invasion of the anti-religious French Revolutionarists. The peak in entries occurred with a time span of two generations in the period 1650-1670, when the number of beguines reached 360. Janssens, P. (red.) (2006) Belgi√´ in de 17de eeuw, Snoeck Publishers, deel 2, pp 23-25Elsen, K. (1986) Het Groot- Begijnhof te Leuven rond 1700: sociale aspecten van het leven als begijn. K.U.Leuven: Diss. Lic. Moderne Geschiedenis Near 1700, the number had already fallen back to 300, due to warfare (including the Nine Years War) and diseases. By the mid of the 18th century, the number of beguines was further reduced to approximately 250. The sudden increase in entries, followed by a long period of gradual decline, explains the homogeneity in the architectural style of the houses, most of which were constructed in the years 1630-1670. The same demographic evolution can be seen in other beguinages, such as in the nearby town of Diest, or - with some delay - in Lier (where the houses are on the average half a century younger than in Leuven). After the invasion of the French revolutionaries, the beguinage of Leuven was not sold as bien national, as happened with most monasteries and abbeys. The properties of the community were, however, confiscated and attributed to the local welfare commission (the Hospices civils) and reorganised as civil almshouses. Beguines were allowed to continue to live in their houses but free rooms were rented to elderly and poor people. Some former clerics lived on their mandatory pension in the beguinage, among them the last prior of the abbey of Villers. The last priest of the Beguine community died in 1977 at the age of 107. He is buried in the graveyard of Park Abbey. The last Beguine died in 1988. Restoration Two streets in the Beguinage of Leuven. After more than 150 years in use by the local welfare commission and being inhabited by people not financially able to maintain the dwellings, the place was in deplorable state in 1960. The welfare commission decided to sell the complete quarter. A real estate developer showed interest but abandoned his plans when he learnt that the university wanted to buy and restore the beguinage. This small town was restored between 1964 and 1989 by the Catholic University of Leuven, which had purchased the site in 1962 from the Social Welfare Commission. The restoration proceeded in two phases. The majority of the streets were restored in the 1960s and 1970s, under supervision of professor Raymond M. Lemaire. The church and the street next to it were restored in 1980s. The large scale restoration project of an entire quarter, and according to the principles of the Venice Charter was an important momentum in the popularity of beguinages and traditional architecture in general. In 1998, it was officially recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. Architecture Narrow street in the Groot Begijnhof of Leuven Timber framing in the Groot Begijnhof of Leuven Detail of a facade in the Groot Begijnhof of Leuven The beguinage of Leuven has the appearance of a small town on its own, with houses planned along a network of narrow streets and small squares. This is in contrast to the beguinages of Bruges and Amsterdam, where all houses face a central courtyard. The only large greenyard, on the left river bank, resulted from the demolition of some houses in the 19th century. Five houses date back from the 16th century, three of which still show timber framing. The house of Chi√®vres was built in 1561, in accordance with the will of Maria van Hamal, widow of William de Cro√ø, duke of Aarschot and advisor in political affairs of Emperor Charles V. The characteristic tented roof with the onion-shaped top, refers to the two towers of the duke's castle in Heverlee (today known as Arenberg Castle). The majority of the houses dates back from the period 1630-1670. They were constructed in the local, traditional architecture, enriched with some sober, baroque elements. The facades show red bricks with sandstone cross-bar frames for windows and doors. A typical element in the beguinage of Leuven are the numerous dormers, often elaborated with crow-stepped gables and round arched windows. Many houses have strikingly few and small windows on the ground floor. The beguines were keen on their privacy. Houses with large windows on the ground floor used to be hidden by an additional wall, as is still the case in other beguinages. A few houses were replaced or constructed in the 19th century, but far less than in other beguinages, such as in Lier. The church is an early Gothic basilica with Romanesque elements. As usual for mendicant orders or women's congregations, it has no tower, only a fl√®che. Since 1998, this fl√®che has carried a small carillon, which plays a short melody every half an hour on 16 bells which had come from the carillon of the Leuven library tower. In 2009, 29 new bells and a baton-type keyboard for manual playing were added to the instrument. The north entrance of the church shows two Latin inscriptions indicating the foundation years of beguinage (1234 - anno domini MCCXXXIIII curia incepit) and church (1305). The east end of the church has a strikingly tall 14th century quire window, whose upper part illuminates the attic above the groin vault constructed in the 17th century. The interior is 27 meter wide (the widest church in town) containing a nave and two aisles of ten bays. Daylight is prominently present. The arcades separating nave from aisles carry statues of the twelve apostles, Mary and Saint Joseph with the holy child. These statues, as most other artwork, are sober baroque. They are accentuated by artificial shades in black paint behind them. The restoration in the 1980s revealed 14th century murals. Ten Hove and Aborg Spanish quarter. This 17th century extension of the Beguinage is also known as Aborg, meaning \`Old Castle' The name of the quarter of the beguinage, Ten Hove (Hof = Court), as well as the old name of the left river bank (Aborg = Vetus Castellum = Old Castle) seem to refer to previous settlement, possibly the court of the first Lords of Leuven. This would then have been the field where the battle of Leuven took place. In 891, the emperor Arnulf of Carinthia ended here in the invasions of the Vikings. No hard evidence for the hypothesis was ever found in the Beguinage, and so, some authors Van Impe, J. (1981) in Mededelingen van de Geschied- en Oudheidkundige Kring voor Leuven en Omgeving, Jaarboek 1981 (volume 21), pp. 165-166 contest the present day beguinage as being the precise location of the battle.

These plants have leaves that are trifoliate, arranged in opposite pairs and flowers that have five sepals, five petals and usually ten stamens of unequal lengths. Description Plants in the genus Acradenia are evergreen trees, sometimes shrubs with trifoliate leaves arranged in opposite pairs and lacking domatia. The flowers are arranged in panicles in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets. The flowers are bisexual usually with five (rarely six) sepals and petals. The sepals are long, joined at the base and remain attached to the fruit. The petals overlap at the base and there are twice as many stamens as petals, usually alternating in length. There are usually five carpels in each ovary and two ovules in each locule. The fruit has up to five follicles joined at the base, each follicle with a single, smooth brown seed about long.

He is accounted one of the restorers of the old casuistic method, a fact that made him worthy of personifying the \\"Jesuit Moral\\" in the eyes of some, who, especially in Germany, attacked his doctrine. An ardent follower of Hermann Busenbaum and of Alphonsus Ligouri, he contributed largely towards the final defeat of Jansenism. Life He entered the Society of Jesus at Montrouge, 22 August 1824; he taught moral theology for thirty-five years at the seminary of Vals, France, 1834‚Äì47 and 1848‚Äì66, and for one year at Rome, 1847-48. Works It was in 1850, after his return from Rome necessitated by the events of 1848, that the first edition of his Compendium theologi√¶ moralis appeared, which at the time of the author's death had reached the seventeenth edition, to mention neither the German translation of Wesselack (Ratisbon, 1858), not the imitations and adaptations published in Belgium, Italy, Spain, Austria, and Germany. In the last-named country the annotated edition of Professor Seitz itself already reached the fifth edition in 1874 (Ratisbon). Deserving of note is the specially annotated edition of Antonio Ballerini and D. Palmieri (Prato, 15th ed., 1907); the edition of Dumas (5thed., Lyons, 1890); the abridged edition of Sabetti-Barret (New York and Cincinnati, 1902, 16th ed.); the edition adapted to Spain and Latin America by Ferreres (Barcelona, 4th ed., 1909); finally the \\"Compendium ad mentis P. Gury\\" by Bulot (Tournay and Paris, 1908). In 1862, Gury published his Casus conscienti√¶ in pr√¶cipuas qu√¶stiones theologi√¶ moralis\\". Of this work the following editions have appeared: Dumas, 8th ed., Lyons, 1891; Ferreres, for the second time in 1908 (Barcelona); and a German edition at Ratisbon (7th ed., 1886). The brevity of the compendium led inevitably to a lack of scientific solidarity. For the uses of his classes at Vals, Gury lithographed a more scientific manual which was never published. His mind was essentially practical, orderly and clear. His method was to proceed by question and answer, taking in the exposition of principles and their conclusions, and finally adding the discussion of more special points. He also knew how to blend happily in his lessons solidity and variety, a quality that gained for him the appointment to the chair of moral theology at the Roman College from Father General Roothaan. Opportunity for actual contact with souls was afforded him by numerous confessions, which he heard during retreats and missions conducted by him in vacations.

During the offensive, Soviet troops captured Vitebsk and Orsha. A Soviet breakthrough during the offensive helped achieve the encirclement of German troops in the subsequent Minsk Offensive. Planning The immediate goals of the Soviet offensive were: * Break through the defences of 3rd Panzer Army to the north and south of Vitebsk and encircle the city, which occupied a salient in the German lines. * Break through the heavily fortified area around the main Moscow-Minsk highway and liberate the town of Orsha. * Commit motorised / cavalry exploitation forces through the gap opened once the highway had been cleared, opening the way for the encirclement of the German 4th Army in the Minsk Offensive Operation. Soviet intelligence had revealed the depth of the German defences on the Moscow‚ÄìMinsk highway near Orsha. As a result, the attack of Galitsky's 11th Guards Army in this sector was to be preceded by specialised engineer units; mine rolling PT-34 tanks of the 116th Separate Engineering Tank Regiment were committed along with assault engineer companies and assault gun regiments in several waves against the fortified and mined positions of the 78th Sturm Division.

The above units were under the overall command of Army Group Centre (Field-Marshal Ernst Busch). =Red Army= * 1st Baltic Front (General Hovhannes Bagramyan) ** 4th Shock Army ** 6th Guards Army ** 43rd Army ** 3rd Air Army * 3rd Belorussian Front (General Ivan Chernyakhovsky) ** 11th Guards Army (General Kuzma Galitsky) ** 5th Army ** 39th Army ** 31st Army ** 5th Guards Tank Army (General Pavel Rotmistrov) ** 1st Air Army Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky was appointed to coordinate the operations of the two Fronts involved. The offensive =Vitebsk= Army Group Centre's northern flank was defended by the Third Panzer Army under the command of Georg-Hans Reinhardt; the lines ran through marshy terrain in the north, through a salient round the city of Vitebsk, to a sector north of the main Moscow‚ÄìMinsk road, held by the Fourth Army. It was opposed by the 1st Baltic Front of Hovhannes Bagramyan, and Chernyakhovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front, who were given the task of breaking through the defences to the north and south of Vitebsk and cutting off the salient. It was in this sector that Soviet forces had their greatest initial gains. The Soviet 43rd Army broke the defences of the German IX Corps, to the north of Vitebsk, within hours, pushing towards the Dvina river. South of the city, the VI Corps' 299th and 197th Infantry Divisions were overrun and consumed by an overwhelming Soviet assault, with a particularly effective breakthrough by the 5th Army at the junction of the 299th and 256th Infantry Divisions' sectors. By 24 June, the German position in Vitebsk itself, held by the central LIII Corps of four divisions, was already serious, as Soviet forces were clearly intending to encircle the city, but no reserves were available to shore up the collapsing defences, and requests to withdraw German troops to the second defense lines, the 'Tiger' line, were denied by the Oberkommando des Heeres. By 25 June Third Panzer Army was disintegrating. In the north, IX Corps had been broken and pushed over the Dvina, blowing the bridges during its retreat. In the south much of the VI Corps had been annihilated, and its southernmost divisions (the 299th and 256th Infantry Divisions) had become separated from the remainder of Third Panzer Army by heavy attacks around Bogushevsk, where they attempted to make a final stand in the 'Hessen' line, the third defence zone. The Soviet 43rd and 39th Armies were now converging behind Vitebsk, trapping the entire LIII Corps. LIII Corps' commander, Friedrich Gollwitzer, had transferred the 4th Luftwaffe Field Division south-west of the city in order to spearhead a breakout, while the 246th Infantry Division attempted to hold open the Dvina crossings. OKH however, denied all requests for complete evacuation: the 206th Infantry Division was ordered to stay in the city and fight to the last man. Troops of the 158th Rifle Division fighting near the Vitebsk railway station during the assault on the city Soviet plans in this sector met with overwhelming success. The 4th Luftwaffe Field Division was cut off and destroyed by the 39th Army on the evening of 25 June, and by the next day the 246th Infantry and 6th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, fighting their way along the road from Vitebsk, had also been encircled. Hitler insisted that a staff officer be parachuted into Vitebsk to remind Gollwitzer that the trapped 206th Infantry Division should not withdraw; Third Panzer Army's commander, Reinhardt, was only able to get this decision reversed by insisting on being parachuted in himself if Hitler continued to order it. By the evening Soviet forces were fighting their way into the city and Gollwitzer finally ordered the garrison to withdraw too, in defiance of the Supreme High Command of the German Army orders. By 27 June LIII Corps had been dispersed, its 30,000 men being almost all killed or taken prisoner; a group of several thousand from the 4th Luftwaffe Field Division initially managed to break out, but was liquidated in the forests west of Vitebsk.The Soviet record, given in Glantz, p.85, states that this group was first intercepted by the 179th Rifle Division at Lake Sarro on 26 June, and was eventually destroyed near Iakubovschina on 27 June. The remnants of IX Corps were retreating to the west, falling back on Polotsk with the 6th Guards Army in pursuit: VI Corps was also largely destroyed. Third Panzer Army had been effectively shattered within days, and Vitebsk liberated: even more significantly, a huge gap had been torn in the German lines to the north of Fourth Army in the former VI Corps sector. =Orsha= The central sector of Soviet operations was against the long front of Fourth Army, which was under the overall command of Kurt von Tippelskirch. Soviet plans envisaged the bulk of it, the XXXIX Panzer Corps and XII Corps, being encircled while pinned down by attacks from the 2nd Belorussian Front in the parallel Mogilev Offensive Operation. By far the most important Soviet objective, however, was immediately to the north: the main Moscow‚ÄìMinsk road and the town of Orsha, which the southern wing of Chernyakhovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front was ordered to take. A breakthrough in this area, against General Paul V√∂lckers' XXVII Corps, would form the northern 'pincer' of the encirclement aimed at destroying Fourth Army. The Minsk road was protected by extensive defensive works manned by the 78th Sturm Division, a specially reinforced unit with extra artillery and assault gun support. Orsha itself had been designated a Fester Platz or strongpoint under 78th Sturm Division's commander, with the 25th Panzergrenadier Division holding the lines to the south. As a result of the strong defenses in this sector, Soviet plans included the commitment of heavily armed engineer units to assist in a breakthrough. Galitsky's 11th Guards Army attacked towards Orsha on 23 June but initially made little headway. By the next day, the Soviet 1st Guards Rifle Division was able to break through the German lines in a marshy, thinly- held area to the north of the 78th Sturm Division, which was ordered back to the 'Hessen' line, the third defence zone. It was now struggling to maintain contact with the 25th Panzergrenadier Division to the south. Chernyakhovsky, encouraged by the 1st Guards Rifle Division's progress, pushed a mixed cavalry / mechanised exploitation force into the breach in the German lines. On 25 June, the German defences began to rupture; a counter-attack at Orekhovsk failed. V√∂lckers' position was further threatened by the near-collapse of the Third Panzer Army's VI Corps, immediately to the north. At 11:20 on 25 June the VI Corps, which had been cut off from its parent formation, was reassigned to Fourth Army. Part of its reserve, the 14th Infantry Division, was brought up to try to slow the Soviet advance north of Orsha. By midnight, however, the 11th Guards Army had shattered the remnant of VI Corps in the 'Hessen' line, and the 78th Sturm Division's situation was becoming untenable: 26 June saw the German forces in retreat. Soviet tank forces of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps were able to push up the road towards Minsk at speed, with a subsidiary force breaking off to encircle Orsha, which was liberated on the evening of 26 June. The main exploitation force, Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army, was then committed through the gap torn in the German lines. VI Corps finally crumbled completely, its rear elements falling back towards Borisov in disarray: its commander, General Georg Pfeiffer, was killed on 28 June after losing contact with his divisions. V√∂lckers was ordered to hold fast, but lacked the necessary resources despite shifting his 260th Infantry Division northwards and moving the 286th Security Division into the lines. The operation effectively ceased with the arrival of 5th Guards Tank Army's forward units at the Berezina on 28 June. Consequences In terms of its objectives within the broader structure of Operation Bagration, the offensive was a complete success: * The two key cities and communication / transport centres of Vitebsk and Orsha were captured. * Heavy damage was inflicted on German forces, with the LIII Corps of Third Panzer Army being almost completely eliminated and other corps suffering high levels of casualties and loss of equipment. * The breakthrough of exploitation forces at Orsha, in combination with a similar breakthrough in the south in the parallel Bobruysk Offensive Operation, set up the planned encirclement of the bulk of the German Fourth Army in the following Minsk Offensive Operation.

Its goals were to capture the city of Mogilev, and to pin down and trap the bulk of the German Fourth Army. The offensive fulfilled both objectives. Planning =Operational goals= The Mogilev Offensive had two main goals within the context of Operation Bagration: *The liberation of the city of Mogilev, an important transport hub. *To pin down the bulk of the German Fourth Army's forces while the parallel Vitebsk-Orsha and Bobruysk Offensives, to the north and south respectively, set up a major encirclement. The Fourth Army, unable to disengage, would be bypassed and trapped. =German intelligence= The XXXIX Panzer Corps before Mogilev was one of the strongest corps in Army Group Centre, with four high- quality divisions. This reflected the strategic importance of the road through Mogilev, which provided the main route through the marshes in the region. However, as with the other German armies involved in Operation Bagration, the Fourth Army was unprepared for a major offensive, as the Oberkommando des Heeres expected that the main Soviet offensive would be against Army Group North Ukraine. Shortly before the attack began, a battalion commander in the 12th Infantry Division raised concerns about a possible attack with General Martinek, who was on a tour of inspection. Martinek agreed but in response cited the proverb \\"Whom God would destroy, he first strikes blind\\": the concerns were not passed on.Glantz, When Titans Clashed, p.219 Deployments =Wehrmacht= *Southern flank of Fourth Army (General Kurt von Tippelskirch) **XXXIX Panzer Corps (General Robert Martinek) **XII Corps (General Vincenz M√ºller) **Reserve: Panzergrenadier-Division Feldherrnhalle The city of Mogilev had been designated a Fester Platz, or fortified area, under the command of Generalmajor Gottfried von Erdmannsdorff. =Red Army= *2nd Belorussian Front (Colonel-General Gyorgy Zakharov) **33rd Army (Lieutenant-General Vasily Kryuchenkin) **49th Army (Lieutenant-General Ivan Grishin) **50th Army (Lieutenant-General Ivan Boldin) **4th Air Army The offensive As with the other offensives in the first phase of Operation Bagration, the Mogilev Offensive opened with an intense artillery barrage against the German defensive lines on the morning of 23 June. East of Mogilev itself, General Robert Martinek's XXXIX Panzer Corps (made up of the 31st, 12th, 337th and 110th Infantry Divisions), attempted to hold its lines in the face of a ferocious assault by Grishin's 49th Army during which the latter suffered heavy casualties.Dunn, p.163 The Fourth Army commander, von Tippelskirch, requested that Martinek be allowed to withdraw to the 'Tiger' line late on 23 June; this was refused, although the reserve Panzergrenadier-Division Feldherrnhalle was ordered forward to take up positions on the Dnieper river in preparation to cover a possible withdrawal by the frontline divisions.Dunn, p.167 The southernmost German corps, General Vincenz M√ºller's XIIth, (with the 18th Panzergrenadier Division, 57th and 267th Infantry Divisions), also began to pull back to the second defensive line. The 49th army forced the Dnieper crossings on the evening of 27 June; two divisions (the 290th and the 369th), fought their way into the town during the night, while mobile units of the 23rd Guards Tank Brigade enveloped the garrison from the northwest.Glantz, Belorussia 1944, pp. 95-6 Troops of the 49th Army during the liberation of Mogilev on 28 June 1944 Mogilev, along with its town commander, Generalmajor von Erdmannsdorff, (later executed by the Soviets for war crimes) and most of the 12th Infantry Division who had been instructed to defend the town to the last man, fell into Soviet hands on 28 June. During the day both the German XII Corps and XXXIX Panzer Corps (whose commander, Martinek, was killed that evening in an air attack), began falling back towards the Berezina crossings. As the roads were clogged with fleeing civilians and military units, and were also under heavy air attack, progress was slow. Consequences The Mogilev Offensive fulfilled all its immediate objectives; not only was the city itself taken, but the Fourth Army was successfully prevented from disengaging in time to escape encirclement in the Minsk Offensive, which commenced immediately afterwards.

In less than a week in late June 1944, the Soviet 3rd Army broke through in the north of the sector, trapping the German XXXV Corps against the Berezina. The 65th Army then broke through the XXXXI Panzer Corps to the south; by 27 June, the two German corps were encircled in a pocket east of Bobruysk under constant aerial bombardment. Up to 70,000 Axis soldiers were killed or taken prisoner. Bobruysk was liberated on 29 June after intense street fighting. Role in the conflict Planning =Operational goals= The operational goals of the Bobruysk Offensive within the context of Operation Bagration were twofold: *To break through the defensive positions of Ninth Army and take the heavily fortified city of Bobruysk. *Commit motorised / cavalry exploitation forces through the gap opened, opening the way for a major encirclement of much of the remainder of Army Group Centre in the Minsk Offensive. =German intelligence= Ninth Army headquarters had argued particularly strongly that a major attack against Army Group Centre was imminent, and General Jordan had bitterly complained about the high command's refusal to sanction tactical withdrawals, but the Army Group commander, Field Marshal Busch, had brushed these concerns aside.Dunn, pp.181-83 Patrols of the 134th Infantry Division had revealed a buildup in the sector of the 35th and 41st Guards Rifle Corps opposite; each of the three regiments of the German divisions was faced with a full-strength Soviet rifle division of 7,200 men.Dunn, p.181 The Ninth Army was, in general, made up of lower quality divisions than Fourth Army to its north; this may have reflected a belief on the part of the OKH that the terrain in Ninth Army's sector was more easily defensible.Dunn, pp.188-9 Deployments =Wehrmacht= *Ninth Army (General Hans Jordan) **XXXV Corps (Lieutenant-General Kurt-J√ºrgen Freiherr von L√ºtzow) **XXXXI Panzer Corps (Lieutenant-General Edmund Hoffmeister) **LV Corps (General Friedrich Herrlein) **Reserve: 20th Panzer Division, 707th Infantry Division (Major General Gustav Gihr) The city of Bobruysk had been designated a Fester Platz, or fortified area to be held at all costs, under the command of Major-General Adolf Hamann. The above units were under the overall command of Army Group Centre (Field-Marshal Ernst Busch). =Red Army= *1st Belorussian Front (Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky) **3rd Army (General Alexander Gorbatov) **28th Army **48th Army **65th Army (General Pavel Batov) **16th Air Army **Cavalry-mechanised group under command of Lieutenant-General Pliev, including 1st Mechanised Corps, 4th Guards Cavalry Corps The above units were under the command of the special representative to Stavka, Marshal Georgy Zhukov. The offensive In the southern sector of operations, where the 1st Belorussian Front under Konstantin Rokossovsky faced Hans Jordan's Ninth Army, the main Soviet objective was Bobruysk and the southern crossings of the Berezina, which would open up the route for the southern 'pincer' of the main encirclement. (Army Group Centre's southernmost flank was covered by Second Army in the Pripet Marshes, but this area was largely bypassed by the Soviet offensive.) Rokossovsky had bravely staked his reputation on a plan for a complex double-envelopment of the German forces at Babruysk, in opposition to Joseph Stalin's preferred plan of a single breakthrough in the sector.Sebag- Montefiore, pp.483-4 Rokossovsky's attack, as with the other initial offensive operations of Operation Bagration, was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment. The first assault, against strong German defences, was however repulsed with heavy casualties. Rokossovsky ordered further artillery preparation for July 24, which eventually resulted in a collapse of the 134th Infantry Division to the north of the sector, as the Soviet 3rd Army pushed forward; the 20th Panzer Division began to counter-attack, but Jordan then ordered it to turn southwards and confront a new breakthrough by the Soviet 65th Army under Batov.Zaloga, pp.61-61 =The encirclement of the German corps= By June 27, Soviet forces were converging near Bobruysk, trapping the five divisions of Ninth Army's northernmost corps, Lieutenant-General von L√ºtzow's XXXV Corps, east of the Berezina. Elements of the central XXXXI Panzer Corps were also trapped, along with the 20th Panzer Division. The disorganised German divisions commenced a series of desperate attempts to escape the pocket, which stretched for several kilometers along the river's eastern bank: the Soviets reported large fires on 27 June as the Germans destroyed their heavy equipment and attempted to break out, but Soviet air attack and artillery inflicted appalling casualties on the encircled forces.Glantz, pp.104-105; the Soviet analysis claims that von L√ºtzow, realising the seriousness of the situation, gave his unit commanders authority for independent action in attempting to break out northwards or towards Babruysk. It states that many men even attempted to swim across the Berezina in an effort to escape. In the meantime, Hitler had relieved Jordan of command due to his confusing instructions to 20th Panzer; Ninth Army was dealt another blow when its main communications headquarters was destroyed by bombing. On the following day, reinforcements arrived behind German lines in the form of 12th Panzer Division, whose commander was greeted by Ninth Army's chief of staff with the words \\"Good to see you ‚Äî Ninth Army no longer exists!\\"Adair, p.135 =The breakout of XLI Panzer Corps= final stage of bobruisk operation (june 27, 0900 PM - july 1 1944) Faced with Ninth Army's imminent collapse, OKH authorised a withdrawal. Lieutenant-General Adolf Hamann, Commander (Commandant) of Bobruysk, was ordered to hold the town with one division, Lieutenant-General Edmund Hoffmeister's 383rd Infantry Division. Thousands of wounded were abandoned in the citadel. The remnants of 20th Panzer Division, with a handful of tanks and assault guns, formed a spearhead for XXXXI Panzer Corps' breakout attempt which was placed under Hoffmeister's overall command, while 12th Panzer Division attacked from the Svislach River to meet the retreating troops. Though a breakout was achieved through positions held by the Soviet 356th Rifle Division of 65th Army, the German forces were again subjected to intense artillery bombardment and air attack as they attempted to make their way along the roads south of Minsk. =The 65th Army takes Bobruysk= Batov's 65th Army now fought their way into Bobruysk street by street against stiff resistance from the German rearguard. Bobruysk, in ruins and with much of its population killed during the German occupation, was liberated on June 29, the 383rd Infantry Division commencing withdrawal towards dawn: no further elements of Ninth Army would escape from east of the Berezina. The German breakout had allowed around 12,000 troops - mostly demoralised and without weapons - from the pocket east of Bobruysk to get out, but the Soviets claimed 20,000 taken prisoner. A further 50,000 were dead: Soviet accounts speak of the area being carpeted with bodies and littered with abandoned materiel. The Soviet writer, Vasily Grossman, entered Bobruysk shortly after the end of the battle: > \\"Men are walking over German corpses. Corpses, hundreds and thousands of > them, pave the road, lie in ditches, under the pines, in the green barley. > In some places, vehicles have to drive over the corpses, so densely they lie > upon the ground [...] A cauldron of death was boiling here, where the > revenge was carried out\\"Beevor and Vinogradova, p.273 Ninth Army had been decisively defeated, and the southern route to Minsk was open.  Accounts, further reading  In addition to Vasily Grossman, the writer and future dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was present at Babruysk as an artillery officer; the experience is mentioned in The Gulag Archipelago.

German forces attempted to organise a defense using rear-area support units and several divisions hurriedly transferred from Army Group North.

A survivor from the 252nd Infantry Division described the experience as \\"a virtual race westwards, trying to outpace the Soviet units advancing as fast as their logistics would allow them. The Division travelled nearly 500 kilometres\\".Account of Armin Scheiderbauer in Rogers and Williams, p.71 Bagramyan's planning envisaged the launch of a final offensive against Polotsk, an important communications and transport centre, on July 1, taking the city by evening.Glantz, p.114 The attack was launched that morning by the 4th Shock Army's 100th and 83rd Rifle Corps in co-ordination with elements of the 6th Guards Army. German resistance was strong, and Soviet units were only able to penetrate the town's defences by the next day. On July 2, Soviet forces were involved in fierce fighting to capture the main railway bridge over the Dvina, which formed the main link between the German forces in the north and south of the city; the bridge was eventually taken by the 156th Guards Rifle Regiment.

The Red Army encircled the German Fourth Army in the city of Minsk. Hitler ordered the Fourth Army to hold fast, declaring the city to be a fortified place (\\"fester platz\\") and defended even if encircled. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army attacked from the north-east, while the 2nd Guards Tank Corps moved in from the east, and the 65th Army advanced from the south. About 100,000 Axis soldiers from the Fourth and Ninth Armies were encircled, of whom some 40,000 were killed and most of the rest captured. The result was a complete victory for the Red Army, the liberation of Minsk, and the rapid destruction of much of the German Army Group Centre. Role in the conflict Planning =Operational goals= The role of the 3rd Belorussian Front in the first phase of Operation Bagration was essentially complete by 28 June, when its cavalry-mechanised units halted at the Berezina. The same day, with the initial objectives fulfilled, Stavka issued a new order, No. 220124. This ordered the Front to force the Berezina from the march, and develop an offensive towards Minsk and Molodechno, capturing the former in cooperation with the 2nd Belorussian Front and reaching the latter no later than 8 July.Glantz, p.117 The 5th Guards Tank Army, under General Pavel Rotmistrov was however criticized for its slowness in attaining its objectives and ordered to display greater decisiveness. =German planning= German planning largely involved damage limitation. The immediate effects of the Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha Offensive and Bobruysk Offensive made it clear that Soviet forces had the 'deep' objective of the city of Minsk. Authorisation was therefore given on 26 June to shift the 5th Panzer Division from Army Group South Ukraine to assist in the city's defence. By the time the operation had commenced, the entire Fourth Army had been bypassed on both its northern and southern flanks. Despite this, it was ordered to hold fast. Its central corps, the XXXIX Panzer Corps, had largely disintegrated under Soviet air attack whilst attempting to reach the Berezina crossings, having lost two corps commanders in as many days.

Some 10,500 explosives were detonated along the rail networks connecting the Dnieper to Minsk, all bridges in the area were blown up, and telephone lines extensively cut, paralyzing Army Group Center's communications for the first 48 hours of the offensive. =The German defence effort= By 26 June, OKH had finally realised that the developing Operation Bagration was the main Soviet offensive, and that Minsk was its objective. As a result, the 5th Panzer Division was brought back from Army Group North Ukraine, arriving in Minsk on 27 June with the unenviable job of attempting to halt the Soviet advance and preventing the complete collapse of Army Group Centre. For the German forces, the military situation was dire: in the Army Group's northern sector, Third Panzer Army had crumbled, with the LIII Corps wiped out, the VI Corps shattered, and the IX Corps being pushed steadily west. In the south, Ninth Army had lost all cohesion, its remaining troops being pounded by artillery and air bombardment. Fourth Army's three corps were now ordered to hold fast, despite being bypassed by Soviet forces on their flanks: Hitler declared Minsk a Fester Platz and instructed the remnants of Ninth Army to reinforce its defence. 5th Panzer, which was reorganised on 28 June into a combat group under the command of Dietrich von Saucken, took up positions near Borisov on the main road north-east of Minsk, along which elements of Fourth Army were fleeing from the front. 5th Panzer's main tank regiments, which unlike many German armoured units at the time were at full strength, were concentrated to the north, screening the rail lines being used for evacuation. The road itself was held by a rearguard of infantry, while Heavy Tank Battalion 505, equipped with Tiger Is, held the rail lines at Krupki to the east. There were few manpower reserves in the area from which a defence could be organised. Some further reinforcements were provided by Gruppe von Gottberg, the rear-area security units of the Dirlewanger and Kaminski Brigades (responsible for a series of atrocities and war crimes in the course of their 'anti-partisan' activities). The crossing points on the Berezina southwards were defended by several police and security detachments organised as Gruppe Anhalt, and elements of divisions from M√ºller's XII Corps, which had fallen back on the town of Berezino. =The Liberation of Minsk= 5th Guards Tank Army was now bearing down on Minsk from the north-east (the subordinate 3rd Guards Tank Corps initially suffering some losses to 5th Panzer's heavy tank battalion at Krupki), while the Soviet 2nd Guards Tank Corps approached from the east. The bulk of 5th Guards Tank Army, accompanied by the rifle divisions of 11th Guards Army, attacked straight down the Minsk road, forcing the German infantry back into Borisov by 29 June: a screen of Soviet troops was left on the road to prevent any more elements of Fourth Army escaping into Minsk. 5th Panzer's engineers blew the bridges over the Berezina on 30 June in an attempt to deny the Soviet forces entry into Borisov.Zaloga, p.60 The overstretched main elements of Gruppe von Saucken now attempted to screen Minsk from the north-west, where the 5th Guards Tank Army threatened to sever the railway lines. The fall of the city seemed imminent: 65th Army was approaching from the southern route, the 5th Guards Tank Army was making progress from the north, and 2nd Guards Tank Corps had crossed the Berezina. In the meantime, the four divisions of XXXIX Panzer Corps had begun to pull back and make for the crossings at Berezino, south of Borisov, in an effort to escape the developing trap. A column of vehicles stretched back for many kilometres, under constant air attack, as the bridge was repeatedly damaged by bombing. The replacement corps commander, Lieutenant-General Otto Sch√ºnemann, was himself killed on 29 June, and the entire corps began to disintegrate. The elements of Army Group Centre holding Minsk began to prepare for withdrawal on 1 July, authorisation finally being given on 2 July. Von Saucken and the 5th Panzer Division were ordered to fall back towards Molodechno in the north- west; von Gottberg, after stating the defences of Minsk were collapsing, withdrew his units towards Lida. With substantial elements of Fourth Army still east of the city attempting to withdraw, the 2nd Guards Tank Corps broke through the defences of Minsk in the early hours of 3 July; fighting erupted in the centre of the city at dawn. By the next day, Minsk had been cleared of German rearguard units, while the 65th Army and 5th Guards Tank Army closed the encirclement to the west. The bulk of Fourth Army, and much of the remnant of Ninth Army, were now trapped. =The destruction of Fourth Army= Over the next few days, Fourth Army made several attempts to break out of the encirclement, led by those divisions still retaining a coherent organisational structure. The largest group of encircled forces comprised the divisions of XII Corps, which remained relatively intact, along with those elements of XXVII Corps that had successfully retreated from Orsha and which were now trapped near Pekalin (in Smalyavichy Raion, Minsk Region). The corps commanders, M√ºller and V√∂lckers, decided on 5 July that their forces should break out to the north-west and west respectively, accompanied by the remnants of Martinek's former XXXIX Panzer Corps; they were now as much as 100 km behind Soviet lines. The 25th Panzergrenadier Division acted as the spearhead for the breakout at midnight on 5 July, but was scattered, with some elements passing north of Minsk to reach German positions. The 57th Infantry Division and Panzergrenadier-Division Feldherrnhalle linked up and attempted to bypass Minsk to the south, but were also dispersed, while the same fate eventually befell the remainder of the 78th Sturm Division (after an initially successful breakout) and most of the other divisional groupings.See Adair, pp.151‚Äì2 Some elements of the 14th Infantry Division under their commander, Lieutenant- General Fl√∂rke, managed to link up with remnants of the 31st and 12th Infantry Divisions; Kampfgruppe Fl√∂rke, after finding Minsk abandoned and burning, was eventually able to escape the pocket and reach the 12th Panzer Division's positions.Niepold, p.195 Lieutenant-General M√ºller, who had been placed in command of all the encircled units of Fourth Army, was captured on 8 July after a failed breakout by the 18th Panzergrenadier Division. He immediately issued an order to all encircled troops to surrender, which was broadcast over loudspeakers by Soviet forces and dropped from Soviet aircraft in leaflet form. A large number of German unit commanders and soldiers chose to disregard the order, however, and continue escape attempts: Soviet forces were reporting actions against groups of encircled German soldiers several thousand strong until mid-July, and smaller groups until some time later.E.g. the 222nd Rifle Division, who after destroying one group at the Svisloch crossings on 7 July, reported an action against a unit of 5,000 Germans who had counterattacked at a village south of Minsk on 11 July (see Glantz, p.183) In total, around 100,000 troops from Fourth and Ninth Armies were caught in the encirclement, of whom some 40,000 were killed, most of the remainder being captured. Partisans played an important role in locating and mopping up the encircled forces. Outcome An exhibition drill routine by the Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus during a civil-military parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the offensive, 3 July 2019. Within the broader strategic framework of Operation Bagration, the Minsk Offensive was a complete success: *The capital of the Belorussian SSR, Minsk, was liberated after three years of German occupation. *The forces of the German Army Group Centre were almost completely shattered within a matter of days. In particular, nearly the entire Fourth Army, plus many of the elements of Ninth Army that had escaped from the Bobruysk Offensive, was destroyed. The 3rd and 2nd Belorussian Fronts were subsequently committed to the third 'pursuit' phase of the strategic offensive in the Vilnius and Belostock Offensives respectively.

Mathias Hauzeur (1589 at Verviers - 12 November 1676 at Li√®ge) was a Belgian Franciscan theologian. Life He was for many years professor of theology. He was a prolific writer and left behind twenty works, while, as a keen controversialist, he attained great celebrity in consequence of his disputation with the Calvinist preacher Gabriel Hotton, which continued from 19 to 22 April 1633, and, was brought by Hauzeur to such a conclusion that the Catholics throughout the vicinity lit bonfires to celebrate his triumph. Works He describes this controversy in his \\"Accusation et conviction du Sieur Hotton\\" (Li√®ge, 1633), issued also in Latin under the title \\"Conferentia publica inter M. Hauzeur et G. Hotton\\" (Li√®ge, 1633). Other important works of Hauzeur are: *\\"Exorcismes catholiques du maling esprit h√©r√©tique etc.\\" (Li√®ge, 1634), directed against the same opponent; *\\"Equulcus ecclesiasticus, aculeatus exorcismis XXIII etc.\\" (Li√®ge, 1635), against the Calvinist Samuel des Maretz; *\\"Praejudicia augustissima D. Augustini pro ver√¢ Christi Ecclesi√¢\\" (Li√®ge, 1634) of which he published a Synopsis in French. He then combined the last-named three works in including in the new volume the \\"Livre de ce grand Docteur S. Augustine du soing qu'il faut porter pour les morts\\" (Li√®ge, 1636). He also issued a Flemish translation of Augustin's \\"De utilitate credendi\\" (Li√®ge, 1636), but his writings against Jansenism remained unpublished. His major works were, \\"Anatomia totius Augustissimae Doctrinae S. Augustini, secundum litteram ... et spiritum\\" (2 vols., Augustae Eburonum 1643-45), and \\"Collatio Totius Theologiae inter Maiores nostros Alexandrum Halensem, S. Bonaventuram, Fr. Joannem Druns Scotum, ad mentem S. Augustini\\" (2 vols., Li√®ge and Namur, 1652). This work is really a commentary on the second, third, and fourth books of the \\"Sentences\\". Like the majority of Hauzeur's works, it was issued from the private press of Franciscans. In reply to Boverius's \\"Annales Ord. Min. Capucc\\". Hauzeur wrote the \\"Apologia Analogica pro vero ordine et successore S. Francisci\\" (Aug. Eburorum, 1650, and 1653). References *Sbaralea, Supplementum ad Scriptores Ord. Min.

The Belostok Offensive was part of the third, or 'pursuit' phase of Operation Bagration, and was commenced after the completion of the encirclement and destruction of much of Army Group Centre in the Minsk Offensive. Belostok () is the Russian name of the Polish city of Bia≈Çystok. Planning =Operational goals= After completing its mission of liquidating the pocket east of Minsk, in which the Fourth Army had been trapped, the bulk of the 2nd Belorussian Front was issued new objectives: initially, to capture Volkovysk and advance towards Bia≈Çystok.Glantz, p.167 The 49th Army, however, was further employed in reducing the encirclement until mid-July. The 4th Air Army continued its mission of providing support for the Front's ground forces. =German intelligence= After the fall of Minsk the Oberkommando des Heeres could call on few reserves to stop the Soviet advance. On the Bia≈Çystok axis, the remaining forces were organised into a 'blocking group' () under the command of General Helmuth Weidling. This included several new formations in addition to the very few troops that had escaped from east of Minsk. To the south, the defence was conducted by the northern wing of Second Army, which had been reinforced, notably with the 28th J√§ger Division, in the hope of mounting an attack to break through to the units of Army Group Centre still trapped east of Minsk. The Germans' defence efforts were aided by the presence of old fortifications and defence works from World War I and earlier.

It crossed the Kotra River by 13 July, and reached Grodno by 15 July. Its 69th and 81st Rifle Corps stormed Grodno on the morning of the next day. The Soviet 3rd Army, on the northern flank of the neighbouring 1st Belorussian Front, took Volkovysk in fighting against Herrlein's LV Corps. =The German counter-attack= On 23 July, the Fourth Army commander, Ho√übach, in agreement with Model, committed the newly arrived 19th Panzer Division into a counter-attack with the intention of cutting off the Soviet spearheads in the Augustow Forest. One regiment surprised the Soviet forces in Grodno (and claimed to have destroyed some 180 tanks, though this seems excessive) before being forced back southwards towards Bia≈Çystok.See Hinze, Ostfrontdrama 1944. Many of the destroyed tanks had been leaguered in the square at Grodno, where they were caught by the unexpected counter-attack. A second regiment recaptured Lipsk, but then was forced to withdraw to assist the first regiment's disengagement. Due to a lack of resources, the German counter-offensive failed, but revealed the exhaustion of both the Soviet and German troops in comparison to fresh units. The 2nd Belorussian Front had successfully forced the entire length of the Neman and Svisloch by 24 July; the 50th Army, with support from the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps, took or retook the eastern part of the Augustow Forest and part of the outlying fortifications of Grodno which the Germans had retained after their counter-offensive.Glantz, p.183 There was intense fighting as the German 50th Infantry Division attempted to defend the highway between Grodno and Bia≈Çystok. In the meantime, the 3rd Army had reached the outskirts of Bia≈Çystok itself, despite strong resistance from the LV Corps. It stormed the city and took it by 27 July, after several days of street fighting. Outcome The Belostok Offensive had proved largely successful in terms of its immediate tactical objectives: by the end of July the Soviets were in possession of the communications centres of Grodno and Bia≈Çystok. However, their supply lines were becoming dangerously extended and their troops exhausted; progress slowed as the Army Group Centre commander, Model, was able to organise an effective defence through judicious management of the few units available. The 2nd Belorussian Front's final objective in Operation Bagration was to advance to the Narew River in the Osovets Offensive.

Rosenberg. The book was released on September 1, 2006 through Tyndale House Publishers, Inc and concerns how current events in the Middle East and other places in the world resemble prophecies from the Book of Ezekiel. An updated version of the book entitled Epicenter 2.0 was released in 2008 in paperback. Synopsis In Epicenter Rosenberg examines current events in Russia, the Middle East, and other countries, as well as interviewing various leaders from Israel, Palestine, and Russia. Rosenberg then takes this information, along with his interviews and experience with events and leaders in Washington, D.C. to compare these changes and events to prophecies made in the Book of Ezekiel. He argues that these are signs of upcoming change, not all of which might be positive, that will change the world completely. Other media =Conference= In 2008 Rosenberg began hosting a series of yearly conferences titled Epicenter that discussed events in the Middle East.

It can be used to visualize scalar and vector fields defined on 2D and 3D structured and unstructured meshes. VisIt was designed to handle very large data set sizes in the terascale range and yet can also handle small data sets in the kilobyte range.  History  VisIt was developed by the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Simulation and Computing Initiative (ASCI) to visualize and analyze the results of terascale simulations. It was developed as a framework for adding custom capabilities and rapidly deploying new visualization technologies. After an initial prototype effort, work on VisIt began in the summer of 2000, and the initial version of VisIt was released in the fall of 2002. Although the primary driving force behind the development of VisIt was for visualizing extremely large data, it is also well suited for visualizing data from typical simulations on desktop systems. Because of its applicability beyond visualizing terascale data, VisIt is made freely available. In 2005 it won an R&D; 100 Award. VisIt is now supported by the DOE's SciDAC (Scientific Discovery Through Advanced Computing) program to assist with analysis and visualization of the large datasets generated by open scientific computing. As such, it is now developed in part by many organizations, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the University of California, Davis, among others. Since VisIt is open source and released under the BSD license, many others have made contributions as well.  Summary  VisIt is an open source, turnkey application for large scale simulated and experimental data sets. Its charter goes beyond pretty pictures; the application is an infrastructure for parallelized, general post-processing of extremely massive data sets. Target use cases include data exploration, comparative analysis, visual debugging, quantitative analysis, and presentation graphics. The VisIt product delivers the efforts of many software developers in a single package. First, VisIt leverages several third party libraries: the Qt widget library for its user interface, the Python programming language for a command line interpreter, and the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) library for its data model and many of its visualization algorithms. On top of that, an additional fifty man-years worth of effort have been devoted to the development of VisIt itself. The VisIt-specific effort has largely been focused on parallelization for large data sets, user interface, implementing custom data analysis routines, addressing non-standard data models (such as adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and mixed materials zones), and creating a robust overall product. VisIt consists over one and a half million lines of code, and its third party libraries have an additional million lines of code. It has been ported to Windows, Mac, and many Unix variants, including AIX, IRIX, Solaris, Tru64, and Linux, including ports for SGI's Altix, Cray's XT4, and many commodity clusters. The basic design is a client‚Äìserver model, where the server is parallelized. The client‚Äìserver aspect allows for effective visualization in a remote setting, while the parallelization of the server allows for the largest data sets to be processed reasonably interactively. The tool has been used to visualize many large data sets, including a twenty seven billion data point structured grid, a one billion point particle simulation, and curvilinear, unstructured, and AMR meshes with hundreds of millions to billions of elements. The most common form of the server is as a stand-alone process that reads in data from files. However, an alternate form exists where a simulation code can link in \\"lib-VisIt\\" and become itself the server, allowing for in situ visualization and analysis. VisIt follows a data flow network paradigm where interoperable modules are connected to perform custom analysis. The modules come from VisIt's five primary user interface abstractions and there are many examples of each. There are twenty one \\"plots\\" (ways to render data), forty-two \\"operators\\" (ways to manipulate data), eighty-five file format readers, over fifty \\"queries\\" (ways to extract quantitative information), and over one hundred \\"expressions\\" (ways to create derived quantities). Further, a plugin capability allows for dynamic incorporation of new plot, operator, and database modules. These plugins can be partially code generated, even including automatic generation of Qt and Python user interfaces. The VisIt project originated at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Agency, but it has gone on to become a distributed project being developed by several groups. Major hubs for the project come from: * VACET, a center for enabling technologies from DOE's SciDAC (Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing) program from its Office of Science, * from ASC, and * from GNEP (the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership from the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy). The project has twenty developers from many organizations and universities, including five DOE Laboratories. VisIt received an R&D; 100 Award in 2005 and is downloaded approximately twenty five thousand times per year.  Features  * Has rich feature set for scalar, vector, and tensor field visualization. VisIt handles 2D and 3D data equally well. VisIt also has the ability to animate data, allowing users to see the time evolution of their data. * Provides qualitative and quantitative visualization and analysis. VisIt provides support for derived fields, which allow new fields to be calculated using existing fields. For example, if a dataset contains a velocity field, it is possible to define a new field that is the velocity magnitude. It also supports a generalized query interface, which allows you to query derived quantities such as volume or surface area. * Supports multiple mesh types. VisIt provides support for a wide range of computational meshes, including two- and three-dimensional point, rectilinear, curvilinear, and unstructured meshes. In addition, VisIt supports structured AMR meshes and CSG meshes. * Powerful, full-featured graphical user interface. VisIt's graphical user interface allows novice users to quickly get started visualizing their data, as well as allowing power users access to advanced features. It automatically creates time-based animations from data sets that contain multiple time steps. It also has a keyframe animation capability that allows users to create sophisticated animations. VisIt allows users to pan, zoom, and rotate objects interactively using the mouse. It also gives users the ability to interactively size and position geometric objects such as planes and spheres. * Parallel and distributed architecture. VisIt employs a distributed and parallel architecture in order to handle extremely large data sets interactively. VisIt's rendering and data processing capabilities are split into viewer and engine components that may be distributed across multiple machines: **Viewer is responsible for rendering and is typically run on a local desktop or visualization server so that it can leverage the extremely powerful graphics cards. ** Engine is responsible for the bulk of the data processing and input/output and is typically run on a remote machine where the data is located. This eliminates the need to move the data and makes high-end compute and I/O resources available to it. The engine can be run serially on a single processor or in parallel on thousands of processors. * Interfaces with C++, Python, and Java. The C++ and Java interfaces make it possible to provide alternate user interfaces for VisIt or allow existing C++ or Java applications to add visualization support. The Python scripting interface gives users the ability to batch process data using a scripting language. This feature can be used to create extremely sophisticated animations or implement regression suites. * Extensible with dynamically loaded plug-ins. VisIt achieves extensibility through the use of dynamically loaded plugins. All of VisIt's plots, operators, and database readers are implemented as plugins and are loaded at run-time from the plugin directory. New plugins can be added simply by installing them in this directory. VisIt comes with a graphical plugin creation tool, which greatly simplifies the process of creating new plugins.

The programme is mainly aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will receive support for innovation activities, better access to finance and business support services. It will run from 2007 to 2013. The programme wants to encourage the usage of information and communications technologies (ICT), renewable energies and to promote energy efficiency. History The CIP is based on Decision No 1639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007 to 2013). CIP is complementary to the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) and is supposed to be \\"mutually-reinforcing [..], each designed to contribute to the success of the other.\\" The program COSME followed up CIP and runs 2014 to 2020. Operational programmes The CIP consists of three programmes: * Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (EIP) * Information Communication Technologies Policy support Programme (ICT PSP) * Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) All three programmes are managed by the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI), an EU government body established by the European Commission to operate and oversee the various activities of CIP. Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (EIP) The European Commission indicates that EIP focuses to facilitate access to finance for the start-up and growth of SMEs and encourage investment in innovation activities and to create an environment favourable to SME cooperation, particularly in the field of cross-border cooperation, thereby promoting and assisting in all forms of innovation in enterprises. The EIP will specifically support innovation efforts in the ecological sector. It also has the broader ambition to promote an entrepreneurship and innovation culture and related economic and administrative reform. To help achieve these objectives the Commission has funded a number of actions. One of these is the formation of the Enterprise Europe Network, which started to form during January 2008. This new network has been established by integrating two former networks: the Euro Info Centres (EIC) and the Innovation Relay Centres (IRC). There are over 500 regional teams across Europe and beyond in 40 countries, making it the world's largest business and innovation support network. The objective of integrating the two networks is to offer businesses a one-stop-shop of integrated services under one roof to better assist companies in addressing their business and innovation need. The type of services offered by many of the regional teams comprises: * business partnering such as supplier, distribution and join venture partner searches * Online tools for tracking European public sector tenders * Online facilities for assistance in finance and grant searches * Advise on IPR and legal matters * Advice on finance including grants, debt and risk * Assist businesses in accessing research programmes and apply for R&D; grants * Advice and assistance on accessing EU programmes and funds * Access to information on EU policies, regulations and support programmes * Technology and R&D; partnering * Assistance for accessing Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) Each of the Enterprise Europe Network Centres also offer a channel for passing feedback from businesses to the Commission on policies. All the Centres are also required to help engage businesses in EU policy-making by promoting consultations opened by the EC.

Life As a professor of moral theology he was noted for his learning, but still more for his Jansenistic tendencies. He took part in all the controversies of his time on grace and free will. While professing himself a follower of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, he favoured the views of Baius and Jansenius. His long sojourn in Rome during the pontificate of Pope Clement XI helped keep him orthodox, but did not diminish his antipathy towards the Jesuits, whom he opposed vigorously all his life. Works He published \\"Theologia vetus fundamentalis\\", according to the mind of \\"the resolute doctor\\", J. Bacon (Li√®ge, 1677); \\"Theologia sanctorum veterum et novissimorum\\", a defence of morality against the attacks of the modern casuists (Louvain, 1700). His chief work is entitled \\"Ethica amoris, or the theology of the saints (especially of St. Augustine and St. Thomas) on the doctrine of love and morality strenuously defended against the new opinions and thoroughly discussed in connection with the principal controversies of our time\\" (3 vols., Li√®ge, 1709). The first volume treats of human acts; the second of laws and virtues, and the decalogue; the third, of the sacraments. In the last volume the author makes frequent use of the \\"Tempestas novaturiensis\\" written by his fellow-religious, Alexandre de Sainte-Therese (1686), and adopts all the novel opinions then in vogue with regard to the administration of the Eucharist. Theologians criticized this work, and it was forbidden at Rome by the decrees of 12 September 1714, and 29 July 1722. The Parlement of Paris also condemned it. Instead of explaining the teaching of the Church, the author fills his book with all the disputes about the relaxation of public morality that were then disturbing men's minds. While not explicitly approving of the errors of Jansenism, he favors them. He even praises the \\"Reflexions morales\\" of Quesnel, which at that point had not yet been condemned. He incurred the censure of the theologians of his own order (Memoires de Tr√©voux, 1715, a. 100). In 1713, before the appearance of the Bull Unigenitus, he published \\"Gratiae per se efficacis seu augustiniano-thomisticae defensio\\", which is a defence of Jansenism. This provoked a vigorous reply from P. Meyer, S.J. (Brussels, 1715). Finally, we may mention his \\"Molinismus profligatus\\" (Cologne, 1717), in which he defends himself against the Fathers of the same society, notably \\"Artes jesuiticae in sustinendis pertinaciter novitatibus laxitatibusque sociorum\\" (4th ed., Strasburg, 1717), where doctrinal controversy is replaced by disquisitions against his opponents and their order.

A notable moment in Atkinson's career was in December 1975, when he was given the task of flying Carlos the Jackal and a number of other terrorists. He extracted Carlos and his fellow terrorists from Algeria, saving the lives of sixty people who had been taken hostage in the raid on OPEC headquarters in Vienna.

It also included the NKVD and the Smolensk State Oblast archives. The archive was then moved to Germany. In summer and autumn of 1941, and again in the summer of 1942 during the advance of German troops, local authorities tried to evacuate archives to the east, and the vast majority of the local archives were moved at great cost. German troops entered Smolensk on July 15, 1941 and as a result, the archive was seized by the Germans and they made propaganda out of it by publishing the documents about repression. In May 1943 the archive was taken by the Germans from Smolensk to Vilnius, then in Poland, where it was isolated from much other material taken to Germany. The remaining part of the documents in Poland were found by Soviet troops in February 1945 in the area of the railway station Pszczyna and returned to Smolensk. Soon the documents became known to the Office of Strategic Services, United States (the predecessor of the CIA). It was stored at the U.S. restitution center at Offenbach. After that, the documents were moved to an underground hangar. A group of American Sovietologists studied the inventory and some original documents and concluded that they contained very valuable information. In 1958, the U.S. government offered to return archival materials to the Soviet Union, but in response the Soviet authorities claimed that it was a fake concocted by the CIA. Records of the archive, particularly the Communist Party documents, covered the years before 1917 to 1941. The archive documents were available for use by American and other Western scholars, who could not get access to party or KGB archives in the Soviet Union. The first historian to make use of the Smolensk materials was Harvard University professor Merle Fainsod, who published Smolensk under Soviet Rule in 1958 based on the archive. The archival documents were also used in the writings of Richard Pipes on early Soviet history and Robert Conquest in his famous book The Great Terror. Since 1963, the Soviet authorities began to attempt to acquire the archive, but nevertheless a public acknowledgement of its authenticity was not made. An account revealed that the acceptance of the offer was viewed by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs as impractical because such move was tantamount to an official recognition of the authenticity of the documents. Only in 1991 did the Russian authorities acknowledge and publicly announce that the U.S. has in its possession a genuine archive, and that Russia intends to seek its return. Negotiations regarding possible transfer began in 1992. However, U.S. authorities tried to link the return of the archive with the return of the Hasidic movement Chabad of so-called \\"library Schneerson\\". As a result, the archive was returned to Russia only at the end of 2002.https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/spring/spoils-of- war-3.html  References   Further reading  * Archives in the Soviet Union Smolensk Oblast Government documents of the Soviet Union Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Smolensk Archive"},{"id":"15981334","text":"Hooker Township is one of twenty-four townships in Gage County, Nebraska, United States.

It is centered in Hong Kong and has jurisdiction over Eastern Orthodox Christians in Southeast Asia. It was set up in November 1996 by the decision of the Holy Great Synod of Constantinople.Official statement of the Church of Constantinople concerning the establishment of the new \\"diocese\\" in Asia History For some years, a small band of dedicated and devout Eastern Orthodox Christians kept the Eastern Orthodoxy flame alive in Hong Kong; while services with a priest were rare, they continued to live the ancient expression of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. A small delegation, representing the St. Luke Orthodox Community, approached Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, requesting that the community be given a full-time clergyman, who could serve the needs of the faithful and offer Orthodox Christianity to the local people. With the efforts of the then Bishop Athenagoras (later Metropolitan of Mexico, Central America and Caribbean, with seat in Panama), a systematic plan was developed. Upon the research and advice of the Bishop, the Holy and Sacred Synod of Constantinople founded the new Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and South East Asia in November 1996, with jurisdiction over: Hong Kong, Macao, China, Taiwan, Mongolia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar and also Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Official Site of the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia On December 2, 1996, Archmandrite Nikitas (Lulias) was elected as the first Orthodox Metropolitan of Hong Kong and assigned the ecclesiastical responsibilities of Southeast Asia. On January 12, 1997, the Enthronment of Nikitas Lulias as the first Metropolitan of the OMHKSEA took place. The ceremony was held at the Orthodox Cathedral of St. Luke, Stanley Fort, Hong Kong, with Metropolitan Athenagoras of Panama representing the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Ten years later, in August 2007, Metropolitan Nikitas was transferred as Metropolitan of Dardanellia and OMHKSEA stayed vacant for a few months. On January 9, 2008, the Holy and Sacred Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate took the decision to split the huge area of OMHKSEA, by creating a new Metropolitanate of Singapore and South Asia, with jurisdiction over Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitanate of Hong Kong remained: Hong Kong, Macao, China, Taiwan, Mongolia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar.Official Site of the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia With the same decision, Archimandrite Nektarios (Tsilis) was elected as the New Metropolitan of OMHKSEA. His ordination took place on January 20, 2008, in the patriarchal St George Holy Church of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Phanar, Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey, and his enthronement is scheduled for March 1, 2008, in the Orthodox Cathedral of St. Luke, Stanley Fort, Hong Kong.AsiaNews: Nektarios is the new Orthodox bishop of Hong Kong See also * Christianity in Hong Kong * Exarchate of the Philippines * Eastern Orthodox Church *Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia (Moscow Patriarchate) ‚Äì an exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church References Bibliography * External links * Official Site - Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia * AsiaNews: Nektarios is the new Orthodox bishop of Hong Kong Hong Kong Eastern Orthodoxy in Hong Kong Churches in Hong Kong ","title":"Eastern Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia"},{"id":"15981404","text":"The Greenock Dockyard Company was a Scottish shipbuilding and ship repair firm located at Greenock, on the River Clyde.

The dockyard had been well established when it merged with the Grangemouth Dockyard Co Ltd to become the Grangemouth and Greenock Dockyard in 1900. The company operated under this name for eight years, becoming the Greenock & Grangemouth Dockyard Co. The Greenock yard was then sold to the operators of the Clan Line in 1918 and in 1920 it was incorporated as the Greenock Dockyard Co Ltd. In 1935, the Greenock Dockyard exchanged its yards with those of their neighbour, Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. The Greenock Dockyard Company built a large number of merchant ships for British merchant lines before, during and after the wars. In 1966 the company was taken over by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Co Ltd, and then became part of Scott Lithgow in 1967. The Cartsdyke yard eventually ceased building ships and closed in 1979.

Apalachin meeting  After being promoted to capo by former boss Filippo \\"Phil\\" Amari, LaRasso and reputed underboss Frank Majuri attended the infamous 1957 Apalachin Meeting, as the only ones representing the newly made New Jersey family. Amari himself did not attend, as he reportedly retired due to family rivalry later that year, and was replaced by Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Delmore. This saw to it that Majuri was demoted to captain, as well as LaRasso was promoted underboss of the North Jersey rackets.  Sam the Plumber  After Delmore's health turned ill and later died in 1964, he appointed his nephew Simone \\"Sam the Plumber\\" DeCavalcante to new boss of his family. DeCavalcante doubled the family's income and membership, and promoted back Majuri as the family consigliere, as well as keeping LaRasso as the reputed underboss. After Sam DeCavalcante and LaRasso were sent to prison due to federal authorities monitoring conversations between DeCavalcante and LaRasso discussing illegal gambling operations worth more than $20 million a year, Giovanni \\"John the Eagle\\" Riggi, LaRasso's rival, stepped up as acting boss while DeCavalcante and LaRasso were imprisoned for 5 years. He was a prominent member of Building Laborer's Union Local 394 of Elizabeth, New Jersey.  A favor for Carlo Gambino  The Brooklyn-based head of the Gambino crime family, Carlo Gambino, asked the DeCavalcante crime family for a favor. The favor was to kill Joseph \\"Joey Surprise\\" Feola, an associate in the garbage business deemed suddenly unreliable. According to Jerry Capeci, underboss LaRasso lured Feola to a garage, where, according to whispered words picked up on the bug, Feola was strangled, wrapped in a burlap bag and buried. LaRasso later confirmed the hit to Gambino captain James \\"Jimmy Brown\\" Failla.  Release from prison  After returning to the DeCavalcante crime family in the early 1970s, LaRasso's position gradually declined as DeCavalcante retired from the New Jersey rackets and moved to Florida, handing the leadership over to Giovanni Riggi. Riggi promoted Girolamo \\"Jimmy\\" Palermo as new acting underboss of the family in the late 1970s, leaving LaRasso's position becoming only official.  Demoted by John Riggi  During the 1980s, Riggi continued to run the large labor and construction racketeering operations in North Jersey with help from various capos Giacomo \\"Jake\\" Amari and Giuseppe \\"Pino\\" Schifilliti. As LaRasso's friend Frank Majuri died and the position of consigliere went to Stefano \\"Steve the Truck Driver\\" Vitabile, LaRasso was demoted in the late 1980s to soldier, as Riggi was put on trial for extortion and racketeering charges along with Palermo, leaving Giacomo \\"Jake\\" Amari as the new acting underboss.  His murder  After Riggi was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1990, John \\"Johnny Boy\\" D'Amato took over as acting boss with Giacomo Amari as acting underboss and Stefano \\"Steve the Truck Driver\\" Vitabile still as consigliere. It was around this time that LaRasso, after a fallout with D'Amato, was reported missing in the summer of 1991 after he failed to show up for his 65th birthday. Reportedly, D'Amato feared LaRasso as a rival and thought he'd turn captain Charles \\"Big Ears\\" Majuri, son of Frank Majuri, to follow him in an attempt to take over the DeCavalcante crime family. His body has never been found, however, his killer Vincent \\"Vinny Ocean\\" Palermo later turned state's evidence and confessed to the crime. Palermo also became the later acting boss and testified against dozens of New Jersey mobsters.  The aftermath  In 2006, More than a decade later, administration member and consigliere Stefano Vitabile as well as capos Giuseppe \\"Pino\\" Schifilliti and Philip \\"Phil\\" Abramo were tried and convicted of LaRasso's murder, as well as two others. In addition to extortion and racketeering charges, these high- ranking mobsters were sentenced to life imprisonment. LaRasso's shooters were reportedly Anthony \\"Tony\\" Capo, Louis \\"Louie Eggs\\" Consalvo and Gregory Rago, who, except for Capo, were sent to prison.

Siddharth and Jaya's family are heartbroken. Aanchal has gotten the job as a fashion designer and is overwhelmed but when she hears about Jaya's death she is deeply hurt and feels guilty. She decides to live her dream for Jaya. Siddharth wishes to keep Jaya's death a secret from his children as he knows they will take this news terribly, but Ayush finds out anyway and although he is deeply upset he hides this news from his siblings as he wants to protect them. A few days later, Siddharth is still unable to forget about Jaya and keeps himself isolated. Juhi and Sachin miss their mother so the duo decide to run to Mumbai to see their mother. Although, Ayush already knows the news he however decides to join them. Whilst on the bus, the bus conductor orders the children to get off the bus as they don't have a ticket. But Aanchal, who happens to be on the same bus stops him and tells him that she is the children's mother. The bus stops for a break and Aanchal feeds the kids and gets to know them. When she asks about their mother, Ayush lies that she is in Mumbai. Aanchal tells them to go back home as their father will be worried. They agree and Aanchal takes them back. They arrive at the Tyagi household where the family members were worried about the children. Siddharth doesn't be at home as he was looking for the kids so Aanchal meets the other family members. They apologise to her for taking the trouble to bring them back, but Aanchal dismisses this. In a conversation with Siddharth's father, he tells her that the children's mother is dead and the children do not know of this. He shows Aanchal Jaya's photograph and she is shocked to discover the children's mother is Jaya whose death was responsible because of her. She is filled with tremendous guilt. Siddharth's father reveals that he is finding a tutor for the kids to home school them and Aanchal wanting to make up for her actions decide to be their tutor. The children are not happy at first but later come around to the idea. Juhi and Sachin know that their mother is dead as no one speaks of her and Siddharth calms them. Aanchal grows closer to the children as she tutors them. They begin to like her especially Sachin. Siddharth and Aanchal happen to meet for the first time and Aanchal introduces herself as the children's tutor. Aanchal sometimes is unable to speak to Siddharth properly as she still feels guilty. On Aanchal's birthday, the children and Dheeraj's son Lucky, plan to throw her a party. Aanchal is overwhelmed to see this and the kids give her presents. However, when Sachin gives his gift it is so picture of Jaya and Aanchal which on Jaya's photo it says 'maa' and on Aanchal's it says 'teacher maa'. The whole family is shocked to see this especially Siddharth's step mother and sister in law, Chanchal who do not like Aanchal because of her close bond to the kids and family members. She and Lalita conspire against Aanchal on many occasions. Ayush gets really angry and starts to hate Aanchal as he thinks she's replacing his mother and he convinces Juhi the same which she begins to hate Aanchal too and the duo humiliate her often. Sachin grows even closer to Aanchal and loves her dearly. Siddharth and Aanchal soon grow close to each other after he offers to help her with her fashion designs as his company works for the same. Siddharth's father and Dheeraj wishes Siddharth and Aanchal to marry and they tell this to Siddharth who is angry and says nobody can replace Jaya. Aanchal overhears this conversation and also feels angry as she doesn't wish to take Jaya's place. Siddharth and Sachin continue to grow closer to Aanchal while Ayush and Juhi continue to hate her more especially after Jaya's mother passes away and they blame Aanchal as Jaya's mother saw Aanchal last. However, this is not true because the Tyagi family visited Jaya's family and Aanchal grew close to Jaya's mother who saw Jaya in Aanchal. Chanchal also blames Aanchal for her aunt's death. Soon, after seeing how close and her love for the children, Siddharth proposes to Aanchal not because he loves her but because he wants Aanchal to be a mother to the children. Aanchal, Haryaman, Dheeraj and Sachin are extremely happy whilst Lalita, Chanchal, Ayush and Juhi are furious. Therefore, Aanchal leaves her dreams of becoming a fashion designer to become a wife and mother.

Soon, after their marriage life is still not the same as Ayush and Juhi still hate their new mother but Aanchal and Siddharth slowly fall in love. One day, Lalita and Chanchal throw Aanchal out the house but Siddharth and Sachin leave with her but Ayush and Juhi don't want to join them so Siddharth angrily cut ties with them. After a while, Aanchal and Siddharth find out they are expecting a child which makes Siddharth overjoyed and Aanchal disappointed as the children still have not accepted her. She secretly plans an abortion behind Siddharth‚Äôs back as she wants the children to accept her first. Siddharth finds out and is angry but gets why she did this. Aanchal and Siddharth decide to keep the baby to see how things go. One day, Sachin gets into an accident which makes him crippled whilst he was in Aanchal‚Äôs care. Lalita and Chanchan taunt her and says she won‚Äôt be able to look after her own child if she can‚Äôt handle others. Siddharth and Aanchal do their best to help Sachin and make him feel better. After a few months, Aanchal finally gives birth to a baby boy whom she names Jai. Seeing as the children have not accepted her yet she gives Jai to her uncle and aunty for them to look after him as her main priority is for the children to accept her and doesn‚Äôt want to cause any problems. Aanchal and Siddharth stay away from their newborn son for a while and focus on Sachin‚Äôs progress. Meanwhile, Aanchal gets a job offer to be a fashion designer and she is elated but she rejects it as she loves her family more than anything and they are her main priority. One day, Juhi sees Jaya in a dream and she tells her to accept Aanchal and treat her as a mother. Juhi explains her dream to Ayush but he rebuffs her. Nonetheless, Juhi decides to accept Aanchal and finally calls her mum. Lalita and Chanchan finally realise their mistakes as they come to know Aanchal sacrificed a lot for their family and is actually a good person. Ayush witnesses this and also believes Aanchal is innocent and a kind-hearted person. In a festival party, Ayush appears with his brother, Jai and hands him over to Aanchal. He apologises to Aanchal and tells her not to give up on Jai because of them. He delivers a speech in front of everyone and calls Aanchal mum. She is overwhelmed with happiness.

It was developed by a UK industrial design company (Warwick Design Consultants) and it employs an integral filterbed and a sealed inlet and outlet. An accompanying brew mechanism draws in the capsule and pierces the inlet and outlet and clamps the capsule to resist the water pressure. The water injector arrangement is designed so that it is not contaminated by the capsule ingredient. Similarly, the outlet is opened by a cutter such that the outgoing beverage does not contaminate that and cause flavour carry over to the next drink. A sequence of hot water and air extracts the flavours and leaves the capsule relatively dry, which is then disposed in the waste box. The capsule only works with the appropriate brewing mechanism. The capsule also has identification features that tell the brewing machine what the ingredient is, which calls up a brewing programme suited to the drink. A second type of capsule allows hot chocolate drinks to be made. Although chocolate powder very quickly turns to a thick impenetrable paste when wetted, the jetting technology ensures complete emptying of the capsule and thorough mixing. The same technology was employed in the development of the Tassimo system.

Frederick Charles Davies (12 April 1884 - 23 July 1932) was a world-class Welsh athlete who was better known to the sporting world as Tenby Davies, and who became the half-mile world professional champion in 1909 after an enthralling race against Irishman Beauchamp Day. Biography Frederick Charles Davies was born at South Parade in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, Wales, the son of John Gwynne Davies (1854-1910), a stonemason and builder, and Sarah Phillips (1852-1935). Freddy Davies went on to achieve recognition as one of the greatest runners Wales has yet produced and was regarded as one of the finest half-milers ever seen, winning the World 880 yds championship at Pontypridd in 1909.Newspaper obituary: ‚ÄòA Famous Welsh Athlete: Death of ‚ÄúTenby‚Äù Davies‚Äô, 27 July 1932 Fred Davies‚Äô versatility as a world-class athlete is underlined by the fact that as well as excelling at the half-mile, he also won events throughout Britain at distances from 100 yds up to a mile. He was a regular competitor in the Welsh Powderhall 130 yds handicap sprints, organised by the Pontypridd Athletic Club and held at Taff Vale Park in the town during the early part of the twentieth-century.Lee, Brian, The Great Welsh Sprint: The Story of the Welsh Powderhall Handicap 1903-1934 (Gwyn Thomas, Pontypridd, 1999) But ‚ÄòTenby‚Äô is probably best remembered for taking on his great rival, Irishman Beauchamp R. Day of Blackpool, at Pontypridd on Monday 23 August 1909 where he decisively beat him over the half-mile distance, clocking an impressive 1 min. 57.6 seconds in the process, which was one of the fastest times recorded in the World for that year.‚ÄòWorld Championship, Half Mile Test at Pontypridd, Tenby Runner‚Äôs Easy Win‚Äô, The Tenby and County News and Visitors‚Äô List, Wednesday 25 August 1909, p. 3; ‚ÄòGreat Victory for Tenby Runner, Freddy Davies Half-Mile Champion of The World‚Äô, The Tenby Observer and Weekly List of Visitors, Thursday 26 August 1909, p. 3.

A rebuke can be given in person by a bishop or by an ecclesiastical court. In the Church of Scotland a rebuke was necessary for moral offenders to \\"purge their scandal\\". This involved standing or sitting before the congregation for up to three Sundays and enduring a rant by the minister. There was sometimes a special repentance stool near the pulpit for this purpose. In a few places the subject was expected to wear sackcloth. From the 1770s private rebukes were increasingly administered by the kirk session, particularly for men from the social elites, while until the 1820s the poor were almost always given a public rebuke.Callum G.

This coastal area was dominated by the indigenous Fante people. It was established by the African Company Act 1750, and in 1752 replaced the Royal African Company. The latter had been established in 1660. The assets of the Royal African Company were transferred to the new company and consisted primarily of nine trading posts or factories: Fort William, Fort James, Fort Sekondi, Fort Winneba, Fort Apollonia, Fort Tantumquery, Fort Metal Cross, Fort Komenda, and Cape Coast Castle, the last of which was the administrative centre. African Committee The company was managed by the African Committee, which was composed of nine committee members, three each from London, Liverpool and Bristol. These were elected from the general body of traders from these cities, who paid 40 shillings to be admitted to the company. The company was funded by an annual grant approved by Parliament, which covered the costs of the London office and the forts. The committee had to report to the Exchequer, the Admiralty and, from 1782, the Secretary at War. John Shoolbred FRSE was secretary to the committee for several years. The imperial government prohibited the African slave trade after 1807, although the company continued to operate for some years afterwards. In keeping with the ethos of liberal reform, administrative authority over the African Company's territory was transferred to Governor Charles MacCarthy of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone having been founded as a refuge colony for freed slaves. (Governor McCarthy was subsequently killed in the First Anglo-Asante War.) In 1817, the company signed a treaty of friendship recognising the Asante claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast, including areas claimed by the Fante. However, after it became public knowledge that the company had failed to suppress the African slave trade within its privately held territory, the British government abolished the company in 1821.

The headquarters of the new company was set at Turin, where it began to build bicycles under the Welleyes brand name. These were a success, and in 1899, the company hired Aristide Faccioli to design a small car with two seats with thee same name. Welleyes was a great commercial success for Ceirano, but managers found themselves unable to cope with the orders of the vehicle. Thus, in July 1899, Ceirano decided to sell the plans and patents to Giovanni Agnelli. Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898, Giovanni Battista and Matteo co- founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899, the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904, Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906, Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906, Giovanni founded SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin.

He became bishop of Ypres. Life Herincx was born at Helmond, North Brabant. After receiving his preliminary education at 's-Hertogenbosch he entered the University of Louvain, where he devoted himself to the study of the ancient classics and obtained the degree of doctor of philosophy. After completing his university course, he resolved to embrace the religious state and entered the Franciscan Order. In 1653 he was appointed lecturer in theology at Louvain. After fifteen years spent in teaching theology, Father Herincx was honoured with the title of lector jubilate, equivalent to the university degree of doctor of divinity. He was twice elected minister provincial, then definitor general, and finally commissary general for the northern countries of Europe. On 28 April 1677, whilst making a canonical visitation in England, he received word at Newport that Charles II had nominated him Bishop of Ypres. He was consecrated on 24 October in the same year, in the Franciscan church, Brussels. He left immediately for his diocese but ruled it for less than a year; he died while making his first diocesan visitation. The epitaph on his tombstone in the cathedral of Ypres says: \\"Ob virtutem et omnimodam eruditionem ad has infulas assumptus\\". Letters found in his room after his death show that his promotion to the cardinalate had been determined on by the pope. Works Guillaume Herincx, Summa Theologica scholastica et moralis, Antwerp, F. Vivien, 1680. His superiors, who had observed his talent and success in teaching, ordered him (1658) to draw up a course of theology for use in the Franciscan schools, and the first volume of his work was published in 1660. The style is concise and clear. In the preface to his Summa Theologica, he writes: > The teaching of theology does not consist alone in the search after truth, > but it behooves us to make use of the truth for our own sanctification and > for the sanctification of others, and above all for kindling and nourishing > in ourselves and in others the love of God. According to the constitutions of his order, Father Herincx propounds the doctrine of Duns Scotus, but he does not neglect the teachings of Bonaventure or Thomas Aquinas. Father Herincx was a Probabilist, and his tractate \\"De conscientia\\" is a masterpiece. He shows that the system of Probabilism is not altogether new, and he draws his proofs from Aquinas, Bonaventune, St. Antonine, and Scotus, although the Subtle Doctor is not so explicit on the matter as the other ancient writers. According to Herincx, the tempest that arose in the seventeenth century against Probabilism had its origin in Jansenism, for Rigorism was unknown among the theologians of the Middle Ages. The decrees of Pope Alexander VII, issued in 1665 and 1666, after the publication of Herincx's work, called for some modifications in the latter, and Father Guillaume van Goorlaeken, lector jubilate, was commissioned to bring out a new edition. His \\"Summa Theologica Scholastica et Moralis\\" was published at Antwerp, 1660‚Äì63; 2nd ed., 1680; 3rd, 1702-04.

Agriculture in Chile encompasses a wide range of different activities due to its particular geography, climate, geology and human factors. Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy, now agriculture and allied sectors‚Äîlike forestry, logging and fishing‚Äîaccount only for 4.9% of the GDP as of 2007 and employed 13.6% of the country's labor force. Some major agricultural products of Chile include grapes, apples, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, beans, beef, poultry, wool, fish and timber.The World Factbook -CIA, 2008-02-27 Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies, Chile is free from diseases such as Mad Cow, fruit fly and Phylloxera, this plus being located in the southern hemisphere (having quite different harvesting times compared to the Northern Hemisphere) and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, the mountainous landscape of Chile limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory. Chile's principal growing region and agricultural heartland is the Central Valley bounde by the Chilean Coast Range to the west, the Andes to the east Aconcagua River to the north and B√≠o-B√≠o River to the south. In the northern half of Chile, cultivation is highly dependent on irrigation. South of the Central Valley, cultivation is gradually replaced by aquaculture, silviculture, sheep and cattle farming.

The use of water from Loa River and other streams is limited due to contamination with heavy metals from the mining industry. Some minor subsistence agriculture is practised in Loa River. Recently these waters are being used for growing non- edible plants, such as flowers. In Norte Grande's Puna plateau, indigenous Aymaras practise traditional llama and alpaca herding. =Norte Chico= Norte Chico has a semi-arid climate that limits agriculture to the Transverse Valleys, namely; Choapa, Copiap√≥, Elqui, Limar√≠ and Aconcagua. Most agriculture here is dependent on irrigation. Norte Chico is known for its production of grapes for Pisco and papayas. Other crops cultivated include olives and avocados . =Zona Central= Zona Central is Chile's agricultural and cultural heartland. With its mediterranean climate, Zona Central hosts the largest part of the country's wine regions. Most of Chile's premium wine regions depend on irrigation to sustain vineyards, the necessary water formed by melting snow caps in the Andes. In the developing wine regions along the Coastal Ranges and in the far south, there is not a lack of needed rainfall but vineyards owners have to deal with other factors, such as the Humboldt Current from the Pacific which can bathe a vineyard with a blanket of cool air. For the rest of Chile's wine regions, the Coastal Ranges serve as a buffer from the current and also act as a rain shadow. The vineyards in these regions are planted on the valley plains of the Andes foothills along the major rivers such as the Maipo, Rapel and Maule Rivers.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 543-546 Dorling Kindersley 2005 =Zona Sur= Aquacultre installations in southern Chile. Wheat cultivation, cattle farming, silviculture and salmon aquaculture are the main agricultural activities of Zona Sur. In northern Zona Sur Araucania Region was known until recently as \\"Chile‚Äôs granary\\". Wheat in Araucan√≠a continues to be the main crop; however, production of oats and lupine has increased significantly. While the area devoted to traditional crops and natural pasture has tended to shrink in Araucan√≠a, there has been an increase in artificial and improved pasturelands. This supports a substantial mass of livestock, including beef cattle, swine, sheep, and horses, and abundant production of milk and by- products. Salmon aquaculture is Los Lagos Region largest source of jobs and main export industry. Nearly all of Chile's, and much of the southern hemisphere, blueberry and cranberry production is concentrated in Zona Sur. Cultivation and production of hazelnuts in Chile is centred in the south- central regions from Maule to Los Lagos. Production increased greatly in the 2010s. In 2016 Chile exported about 6,500 tons of hazelnuts. Chilean hazelnuts are described by Reuters as an alternative to Turkish hazelnuts that dominate the international market. =Zona Austral= Lambs in Tierra del Fuego. In Zona Austral, sheepherding has been a major industry since the 19th century. In the Magallanes Region alone, there is an estimate of 1.5 and 2 million sheep that is distributed among 300 farmers as of 2006.Mercopress - Sheep farming innovation in Magallanes Region 2008-02-28 Exotic species, like reindeer, have been introduced in recent years. Agriculture in the north- western parts of Zona Austral (Ais√©n, Chilo√© and Palena) focuses on aquaculture and silviculture and is similar to that of Zona Sur. Evidence ranging from historical records, local agriculturalists, and DNA analyses strongly supports the hypothesis that the most widely cultivated variety of potato worldwide, Solanum tuberosum tuberosum, is indigenous to Chilo√© Island and has been cultivated by the local indigenous people since before the coming of the Spanish.Molecular description and similarity relationships among native germplasm potatoes (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum L.) using morphological data and AFLP markers, Jaime Solano Solis et al., Electronic Journal of Biotechnology, July 2007Using DNA, scientists hunt for the roots of the modern potato History =Pre-Hispanic agriculture= Huaso in a Chilean wheat field, 1940. The picture illustrates some of Chile's two most important agriculture products cattle farming and wheat. At the time of the arrival of the first Spaniards to Chile the largest indigenous population concentration was in the area spanning from Itata River to Chilo√© Archipelago.Otero 2006, p. 36. In this area indigenous groups practised glade agriculture among the forests.Otero 2006, pp. 21‚Äì22. The forests provided firewood, fibre and allowed the production of planks. Agriculture type varied; while some Mapuches and Huilliches practised a slash-and-burn type of agriculture some more labour-intensive agriculture is known to have been developed by Mapuches around Budi Lake (raised fields) and the Lumaco and Pur√©n valleys (canalized fields).Dillehay, Tom D.; Pino Quivira, Mario; Bonzani, Ren√©e; Silva, Claudia; Wallner, Johannes; Le Quesne, Carlos (2007) Cultivated wetlands and emerging complexity in south-central Chile and long distance effects of climate change. Antiquity 81 (2007): 949‚Äì960 Pre-Hispanic agriculture extended as far south as the Guaitecas Archipelago (44¬∞ S), were indigenous Chonos cultivated Chilo√© potatoes. Tools are known to have been relatively simple. In addition the Mapuche and Huilliche economy was complemented with chilihueque raising, fishing, collection of shellfish and algae.Villalobos et al. 1974, p. 50. =Colonial agriculture= As the Spanish settled in Chile in the 16th century many cities were founded and indean labour partitioned among Spanish conquistadores.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 109‚Äì113. Beyond subsistence the 16th century economy of Chile was oriented towards large-scale production. Spanish colonizers used large amounts of indigenous labour following the slave labour system used in the sugar cane plantations of the Mediterranean islands and Macaronesia. This system of labour successively killed the production base leading to the imposition of the encomienda system by the Spanish Crown in order to prevent excesses. In Chile Spanish settlers managed to continue to exploit indigenous labour under slave like conditions despite the implementation of the encomienda. Rich Spanish settlers had over time to face opposition to their mode of production by Jesuits, Spanish officials and indigenous Mapuches.Salazar 1985, pp. 23‚Äì25. All mainland Spanish settlements (red dots) south of Biob√≠o River were destroyed by 1604. The initial Spanish settlers of Chilo√© Archipelago (conquered in 1567) attempted to base their economy on gold extraction and a \\"hispanic-mediterranean\\" agricultural model. This activity ended in a general failure given the unsuitable conditions of the archipelago.Torrej√≥n, Fernando; Cisternas, Marco; Alvial, Ingrid and Torres, Laura. 2011. Consecuencias de la tala maderera colonial en los bosques de alece de Chilo√©, sur de Chile (Siglos XVI-XIX)*. Magallania. Vol. 39(2):75‚Äì95. Spaniards however reoriented their activities into logging Fitzroya. The collapse of the Spanish cities in the south following the battle of Curalaba (1598) meant for the Spaniards the loss of both the main gold districts and the largest indigenous labour sources.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 15. After those dramatic years the colony of Chile became concentrated in the central valley which became increasingly populated, explored and economically exploited. Following a tendency common in the whole Spanish America haciendas were formed as the economy moved away from mining and into agriculture and husbandry.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 160‚Äì165. 1744 engraving published in Relaci√≥n hist√≥rica del viaje a la Am√©rica meridional. The image shows cattle in the Chilean countryside including a square for cattle slaughter. In the 17th century economy of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile's husbandry and agriculture based economy had a peripheral role, contrasting to ore-rich districts like Potos√≠ and the wealthy city of Lima. Husbandry products made up the bulk of Chilean exports to the rest of the viceroyalty. These products included suet, charqui and leather. This trade made Chilean historian Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna label the 17th century the century of suet (Spanish: Siglo del sebo). Villalobos, Sergio; Retamal √Åvila, Julio and Serrano, Sol. 2000. Historia del pueblo Chileno. Vol 4. p. 154. Other products exported included dry fruits, mules, wines and minor amounts of copper. Trade with Peru was controlled by merchants from Lima that enjoyed protection by the Spanish authorities in Lima. In addition to the exports to coastal Peru Chile also exported products inland to Upper Peru through the port of Arica. Trade inside Chile was small since cities were tiny and self-sufficient. In the 1650‚Äì1800 period the Chilean lower classes grew considerably in size.Salazar 1985, p. 49. To deal with the poor and landless population a policy of founding citiesThese cities were often in fact more of villages or towns due to their size. and granting lands in their surroundings was implemented. From 1730 to 1820 a large number of farmers settled in the outskirts of old cities or formed new cities.Salazar 1985, p. 58. Settling as a farmer in the outskirts of old cities (La Serena, Valpara√≠so, Santiago and Concepci√≥n) was overall more popular than joining a new city since it secured a larger consumer market for agricultural products.Salazar 1985, p. 52. Chilean haciendas (latifundia) engaged little in the supply of Chilean cities but focused on international exports for revenues.Salazar 1985, p. 88. Chile begun exporting cereals to Peru in 1687 when Peru was struck by both an earthquake and a stem rust epidemic.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 155‚Äì160. Chilean soil and climatic conditions were better for cereal production than those of Peru and Chilean wheat was cheaper and of better quality than Peruvian wheat.Collier, Simon and Sater William F. 2004. A History of Chile: 1808‚Äì2002 Cambridge University Press. p. 10. According to historians Villalobos et al. the 1687 events were only the detonant factor for exports to start. The Chilean Central Valley, La Serena and Concepci√≥n were the districts that came to be involved in cereal export to Peru. Compared with the 19th century the area cultivated with wheat was very small and production modest. Initially Chilean latifundia could not meet the wheat demand due to a labour shortage, so had to incorporate temporal workers in addition to the permanent staff. Another response by the latifundia to labour shortages was to act as merchants buying wheat produced by independent farmers or from farmers that hired land. In the period 1700 to 1850 this second option was overall more lucrative.Salazar 1985, pp. 40‚Äì41 The 1687 Peru earthquake also ended a Peruvian wine-boom as the earthquake destroyed wine cellars and mud containers used for wine storage. The gradual decline of Peruvian wine even caused Peru to import some wine from Chile as it happened in 1795 when Lima imported 5.000 troves (Spanish: botijas) from Concepci√≥n in southern Chile. This particular export showed the emergence of Chile relative to Peru as a wine-making region. =Early Republican Era= The independence wars in Chile (1810‚Äì1818) and Peru (1809‚Äì1824) had a negative impact on the Chilean economy. Trade was disrupted and armies in Chile pillaged the countryside. The war made commerce a high risk activity and royalist Peru, then the only market for Chilean agricultural products, was closed to commerce with independent Chile. The Guerra a muerte phase was particularly destructive for the Biob√≠o area and ended only to see a period of outlaw banditry (e.g. Pincheira brothers) occur until the late 1820s.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 406‚Äì413. Cornelio Saavedra Rodr√≠guez in a meeting with the main Mapuche loncos of Araucania in 1869. With the Occupation of the Araucan√≠a, that culminated in the 1880s, new lands were made available for non-indigenous agriculture. The Chilean silver rush that developed from 1830s onward led a significant impact in agriculture as rich miners invested in the agriculture sector.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 469‚Äì472. German immigrants that arrived from 1850 to 1875 pioneered the use of wage labour in agriculture. In the 19th century, access to the Californian and Australian markets made wheat export a very lucrative activity. La Hacienda (1830‚Äì1930). Memoria Chilena. In the mid 19th century, these countries experienced large gold rushes which created a large demand for wheat. Chile was at the time the \\"only wheat producer of some importance in the Pacific\\".Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 481‚Äì485. At the same time as the wheat cycle new irrigation canals were built and apiculture and some machines introduced into Chilean agriculture. Econom√≠a chilena durante el siglo XIX. Cristi√°n Sep√∫lveda Irribarra. Apart from that, new markets were explored for Chilean agricultural products. The wheat boom did not last for long; by 1855 California managed to supply itself with wheat and from 1858 onwards it went over to export wheat to Chile. The Australian gold rush of 1851 had the effect of decreasing the labour used in agriculture forcing the colony to import wheat from Chile sustaining Chilean wheat exports whilst the Californian market vanished. After the gold rushes of California and Australia were over these regions begun exporting wheat competing with Chilean wheat forcing from the mid-1860s onwards wheat exports to be shifted to England. Between 1850 and 1875 the area cultivated with wheat and barley for export in Chile rose from 120 to 450 ha.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 102. The \\"cycle\\" came to an end in the late 1870s due to the increased technification of agriculture in the United States and Argentina plus the competition of Russia and Canada.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 25‚Äì29. The end of the wheat cycle added to the already difficult situation that Chilean economy was passing through in the 1870s. Until the mid-19th century more than 80% of Chilean population remained rural working in agriculture or mining and was to a large degree self-sufficient to produce articles of consume.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 133‚Äì134. Starting in 1873, Chile's economy deteriorated.Palma, Gabriel. Trying to 'Tax and Spend' Oneself out of the 'Dutch Disease': The Chilean Economy from the War of the Pacific to the Great Depression. p. 217‚Äì240 In agriculture this was seen as Chilean wheat exports were outcompeted by production in Canada, Russia, and Argentina.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 6003‚Äì605. As the victor and possessor of a new coastal territory following the War of the Pacific, Chile benefited by gaining a lucrative territory with significant mineral income. The national treasury grew by 900 percent between 1879 and 1902, due to taxes coming from the newly acquired lands.Crow, The Epic of Latin America, p. 180 British involvement and control of the nitrate industry rose significantly,Foster, John B. & Clark, Brett. (2003). \\"Ecological Imperialism: The Curse of Capitalism\\" (accessed September 2, 2005). The Socialist Register 2004, p190‚Äì192. Also available in print from Merlin Press. but from 1901 to 1921 Chilean ownership increased from 15% to 51%.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 124‚Äì125. The growth of Chilean economy sustained in its saltpetre monopoly meant, compared to the previous growth cycle (1832‚Äì1873), that the economy became less diversified and overly dependent on a single natural resource. The establishment of the Buenos Aires-Mendoza railroad in 1885 ended the lengthy and costly trade with carts that connected these two regions of Argentina and facilitated cattle exports from the pampas to Chile, albeit in the last portion of the route the cattle had to walk over the high mountain passes of the Andes.Benjamin S. 1997. Meat and Strength: The Moral Economy of a Chilean Food Riot. Cultural Anthropology, 12, pp. 234‚Äì268. These imports resulted in a lowering of meat prices in Chile. Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura (National Agriculture Society), a landowners organization, pushed for a tariff on Argentine cattle and in 1897 the tariff was passed in a bill at the Chilean congress. The unpopular tariff resulted a massive protest in that degenerated into a destructive riot in Santiago in October 1905. Chilean wine exports to Argentina were hampered by the lack of effective land transport and a series of war scares. This situation changed after the Pactos de Mayo were signed in 1902 and the inauguration of the Transandine Railway in 1909, making war unlikely and trade across the Andes easy. Governments agreed to sign a free trade agreement. Argentine winegrowers association, Centro Vitivin√≠cola Nacional, dominated by European immigrants protested vigorously against the free trade agreement since Chilean wines were considered a threat to the local industry. The complaints of Argentine wine growers in conjunction with that of Chilean cattle farmers represented in Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura ended up tearing down the plans for a free trade agreement. Tierra del Fuego and much of Magallanes Region did also experienced a fast growth of the sheepherding industry since the 1880s accompanied by colonization of the sparsely populated Patagonian grasslands. In the South-Central Araucan√≠a the Chilean invasion of native Mapuche territory caused the economy of Araucan√≠a to change from being based on sheep and cattle herding to one based on agriculture and wood extraction. The Mapuches' loss of land following the occupation caused severe erosion since Mapuches continued to practice large- scale livestock herding in limited areas.Bengoa 2000, pp. 262‚Äì263. =19th century= The 1900‚Äì1930 period was the one of largest growth of agriculture in the 20th century until the 1980s.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 106‚Äì107. Despite of this conditions in for rural workers remained harsh with Tancredo Pinochet denouncing the poor conditions of workers in the hacienda of president Juan Luis Sanfuentes during his presidency (1915‚Äì1920). Within a dual sector economic model the Chilean hacienda has been characterized as a prime example of a primitive and rural component. McBride, a British who visited Chile in the 1930s, is reported to have been \\"astounded\\" to see haciendas with \\"agricultural methods that reminds of ancient Egypt, Greece or Palestine.\\" Starting in 1953 the growth rate of Chilean economy decreased to an annual average of 0.7% but increased to an annual average of 2.4‚Äì3.0% in the 1957‚Äì1960 period.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 143‚Äì144. The decline in the economic growth from 1953 was attributed by some to a neglect of agriculture.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 145. The agrarian production in Chile contracted from 1950 onwards. A government plan set up in 1954 to address this ended with meager results and in 1958 a new plan was presented. That plan allowed CORFO to develop investments in dairy plants, refrigerated slaughterhouses, sugar refineries and transport infrastructure.

Manchester: The Chethem Society. p. 82. Works Roby wrote an influential, two-volume study on English folklore, The Traditions of Lancashire, in 1829. The book was a hit with the British upper classes, and it was reprinted within a year. Roby published a second series in 1831. Francis Palgrave thanked Roby for the work and asked him to write more. Nevertheless, readers did not believe that a banker could have written the books, and speculation named several others as the real author, including Crofton Croker. The works were condensed into three volumes and republished in 1841 for the general public as Popular Traditions of Lancashire.Dorson 98‚Äì99. Roby wrote in the introduction that he intended to continue with volumes on other popular English traditions, but he never followed up on the promise. Different versions of The Traditions of Lancashire were reprinted in 1906, 1911, 1928, and 1930.Dorson 99. He taught a four-session course on \\"Tradition, as connected with, and illustrating history, antiquities, and Romance\\" in his hometown of Rochdale.Dorson 100. In some respects, Roby's efforts presaged later work in folkloristics. He used the term \\"oral tradition\\" long before it came into common academic usage. He noticed and wrote about similarities between folk beliefs in different regions in different eras. Roby denied any authority as a folklorist (antiquarian) and instead called himself simply a collector of oral traditions: > In the northern counties, and more particularly in Lancashire ... it may > readily be imagined that a number of interesting legends, anecdotes, and > scraps of family history, are floating about, hitherto preserved chiefly in > the shape of oral tradition. The antiquary, in most instances, rejects the > information that does not present itself in the form of an authentic and > well-attested fact; and legendary lore, in particular, he throws aside, as > worthless and unprofitable. The author of the 'Traditions of Lancashire,' in > leaving the dry and heraldic pedigree which unfortunately constitute the > great bulk of those works that bear the name of county histories, enters on > the more entertaining, though sometimes apocryphal narratives, which > exemplify and embellish the records of our forefathers. A native of > Lancashire, and residing there during the greater part of his life, he has > been enabled to collect a mass of local traditions, now fast dying from the > memories of the inhabitants. It is his object to perpetuate these > interesting relics of the past, and to present them in a form that may be > generally acceptable, divested of the dust and dross in which the originals > are but too often disfigured, so as to appear worthless and uninviting.Roby, > John (1829). Traditions of Lancashire, vol. I, v‚Äìvi. London. Quoted in > Dorson 99. Nevertheless, as folklore studies advanced, his work came to be viewed as untrustworthy. Roby seems to have been ignorant of the works of English antiquaries who were developing the field at the time. Instead, he sided with the Romanticists and saw folklore as faulty and lowly, the blemished utterances of peasants, which needed a more advanced hand to render in its full beauty. His technique was to collect folk stories and rewrite them into coherent tales in a more refined style. He used a copy of the Encyclopedia of Antiquities by Thomas Dudley Fosbroke (1825) to check details of \\"costume and furnishings.\\" For example, when he was trying to write the tale of a boggart rumoured to haunt the area of Clegg Hall northeast of Rochdale, he found the tales of the locals too mutually irreconcilable to weave into a coherent whole. In the end, Roby took the only kernel of continuity‚Äîa jealous uncle who threw his two nephews into a moat to steal their inheritance in the 13th or 14th century and the subsequent haunting of the hall‚Äîand spun it into a 50-page work of fancy. Still, Roby's works were celebrated in their time, and later folklorists referred to them until the 1870s when new works on Lancashire legends superseded them.Dorson 101. Folklorist William E. A. Axon wrote in 1899 of the caution with which Roby's works had come to be viewed: \\"The late Mr. John Roby, whose 'Traditions of Lancashire' first appeared in 1829, was a diligent collector of local legends, but his object was purely literary, and accordingly his book must be used cautiously, though it certainly contains important data.\\"Axon, William E. A. (1899). Echoes of Old Lancashire. London: William Andrews & Co. p. 200. After his death, Roby's wife published his unfinished works and biography as The Legendary and Poetical Remains of John Roby, despite the fact that his life was \\"so private it afforded but few materials.\\"Roby v.

The conclave =Divisions among cardinals= College of Cardinals was divided into several factions, which initially formed two blocs:L. Pastor, p. 146 *Curial group ‚Äì it included two factions of curial Cardinals: Anziani ‚Äì the small party of the Cardinals created by Pope Clement XII with his Cardinal-nephew Neri Maria Corsini as leader; and Zelanti ‚Äì the group of the conservative Cardinals, headed by Cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli, who generally opposed any secular influence on the Church. *Union of Crowns ‚Äì it included representatives and allies of the Catholic courts. The interests of Ferdinand VI of Spain were represented by Portocarrero, those of Charles V of Sicily/Charles VII of Naples ‚Äì by Orsini, and those of Maria Theresa of Austria and her consort Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor by Alessandro Albani (also protector of Sardinia) and von Rodt. The French faction was leaderless at the time of death of Benedict XIV, because Cardinal-protector of France Pierre Gu√©rin de Tencin died on March 2, 1758. King Louis XV of France appointed Cardinal Prospero Colonna di Sciarra as his successor, but this nomination became publicly known only on June 9, almost a month after the beginning of the conclave. Many cardinals created by Benedict XIV (called \\"Juniors\\") did not belong to any faction, but majority of them aligned themselves with \\"Union of Crowns\\", particularly with Spanish protector Portocarrero. During the conclave, however, these two groups mixed with each other. Near the end of the conclave, on the one side there was the Imperial faction together with Zelanti, and on the other side Anziani, together with the Bourbon faction (defending the interests of the Bourbon crowns). Because of the absence of the political representatives of the main Catholic courts the ambassadors of France and the Empire asked the electors for delay voting until their arrival. This demand was rejected before the conclave began. =The beginning and the early candidates= Only twenty-seven cardinals entered the conclave on May 15.L. Pastor, p. 149 Eighteen more cardinals arrived in Rome by June 29. Meantime, however, Cardinal Bardi had to leave the conclave due to illness. No serious candidates were proposed in the early ballots. In the first scrutiny on May 16 the greatest number of votes (eight in the ballot and three more in the accessus) were received Dean of the College of Cardinals Rainiero d'Elci, who was 88 years old.L. Pastor, p. 149-150 It does not mean, however, that no efforts to obtain the support for the candidates were made by the leaders present in the conclave. In particular Corsini worked vigorously for the election of Giuseppe Spinelli, leader of the Zelanti, but met with the strong opposition of Orsini, Cardinal Protector of the Kingdom of Naples. The protector of Spain, Portocarrero, also rejected Spinelli, and was able to join many of the \\"Juniors\\" to his party. Finally, the candidature of Spinelli had to be withdrawn. The first candidate with serious chances for election was Alberico Archinto, Secretary of State and Vice-Chancellor of the deceased pope. He had a strong support both among Zelanti and some of the \\"Crown-Cardinals\\", but the faction of Corsini did not agree to support him and produced as counter-candidate Marcello Crescenzi. Eventually, as had occurred many times before and later, the candidatures of Archinto and Crescenzi eliminated each other. =The arrival of the French cardinals and their exclusion against Cavalchini= Gradually, the representatives of royal courts arrived in Rome with instructions from their monarchs. On June 4 entered Cardinal Luynes with the instructions of Louis XV of France. Five days later he officially announced the nomination of Cardinal Prospero Colonna di Sciarra to the post of Protector of France.L. Pastor, p. 151 But the Imperial Cardinal von Rodt was still awaited. During the next days the new candidate Carlo Alberto Guidobono Cavalchini, received still more votes, promoted by Corsini and Portocarrero working together. On June 19 he obtained twenty-one votes, on June 21 twenty-six, and in the evening of June 22 as many as twenty-eight out of forty-three, which meant that he was only one vote short of being elected. But after that ballot Cardinal Luynes informed the Dean of the Sacred College Rainiero d‚ÄôElci of the official veto of the King of France against Cavalchini. France opposed Cavalchini because of his support of the beatification of Robert Bellarmine and in the matters connected with the anti-Jansenist bull Unigenitus.L. Pastor, p. 152-153 The exclusion met with strong protests, but Cavalchini himself said, \\"It is a manifest proof that God deems me unworthy to fill the functions of his vicar upon earth\\". After the collapse of Cavalchini's candidacy, Portocarrero advanced as a new candidate Paolucci, but he was rejected by French, who ‚Äì together with the faction of Corsini, voted again for Crescenzi.L. Pastor, p. 154-155 =The arrival of Cardinal von Rodt= The arrival of Cardinal von Rodt on June 29 with the instructions of the Imperial Court was the turning point of the conclave. He initially tried to achieve an agreement with the French, but having failed, he turned toward the Zelanti faction. Direct negotiations between von Rodt and Spinelli resulted in the proposal for election of the Venetian Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of Padua. On July 6 in the morning the bishop of Padua received eight votes in the ballot and four additional in the accessus. Portocarrero, Albani and the French cardinals initially opposed, but finally agreed for him. After the consultations of French Cardinals with ambassador Laon it became clear that Rezzonico would be elected to the Papacy.L. Pastor, p. 155 The election of Pope Clement XIII On July 6 in the evening Carlo Rezzonico was elected Pope, receiving thirty- one votes out of forty-four, one more than the required majority of two- thirds. The remaining thirteen (including his own) fell to Cardinal Dean Rainiero d'Elci. Rezzonico accepted his election and took the name of Clement XIII, in honour of Pope Clement XII, who had elevated him to the cardinalate in 1737.L. Pastor, p. 156 He was crowned on July 16 in the loggia of the patriarchal Vatican Basilica by protodeacon Alessandro Albani.S. Miranda: Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico (Pope Clement XIII) List of participants Pope Benedict XIV died on May 3, 1758. Forty-five out of fifty-five Cardinals participated in the subsequent conclave.

Life He had been teaching for eight years in Park Abbey, the Premonstratensian house near Louvain, when he was appointed professor of theology at the university. Like Michael Baius, who was his senior colleague, Hessels preferred drawing his theology from the Church Fathers, especially from Augustine of Hippo, rather than from the Schoolmen. In 1559 he accompanied the elder Cornelius Jansenius (later Bishop of Ghent) and Baius to the Council of Trent and took an active part. He prepared the decree \\"De invocatione et reliquiis sanctorum et sacris imaginibus\\". Even at Trent the Scholastic party found fault with his departure from the beaten tracks of learning; after his return the attacks continued. Hessels, however, used his energy against the Protestants. He was an opponent of Georgius Cassander.Rob van der Schoor, The Reception of Cassander in the Republic in the Seventeenth Century , p. 101 in Christiane Berkvens- Stevelinck, Jonathan Irvine Israel, Guillaume Henri Marie Posthumus Meyjes (editors), The Emergence of Tolerance in the Dutch Republic (1997).

He is best known for co-founding the Neue Wilde movement in the early 1980s. Biography = 1951‚Äì1994 = Stefan Szczesny was born in Munich as the son of the philosopher and publisher Gerhard Szczesny and his wife Martha Meuffel, a theatre producer. Upon attending primary and secondary schools in Munich, he acquired his first training as a painter at a private art school in Munich (1967‚Äì9). From 1969 to 1975, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. His mentor there was the abstract painter G√ºnter Fruhtrunk. During this time, he also attended lectures in art history and philosophy at Ludwig Maximilian University and worked as a freelance art critic. Under the influence of his mentor Fruhtrunk Szczesny experimented in these years with abstract and minimalist art. A major turn-about occurred in 1975-76, when Szczesny was in Paris on a scholarship of the German Academic Exchange Service. The encounter there with the paintings of Delacroix caused Szczesny to rethink abstract and minimalist tenets and to return, eventually, to figuration. The break was not immediate: in 1979, for instance, he exhibited relatively abstract paintings at the Kunstforum of the St√§dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus; many of the works created during a stay at the Villa Romana in Florence in 1980, too, display abstract features. Nonetheless, it was as a figurative painter that Szczesny eventually gained wide public attention, in particular as the organiser of, and participant in, the 1981 exhibition Rundschau Deutschland. Rundschau Deutschland brought together works of a number of young German-speaking figurative painters who later came to be known as the Neue Wilde. Szczesny was one of the protagonists of the Neue Wilde. In 1982, he participated in a number of \\"Neue Wilde\\"-related exhibitions, such as \\"5 aus K√∂ln\\" (\\"5 from Cologne\\", with Walter Dahn, Jiri Dokoupil, Gerhard Kever and Andreas Schulze) and \\"Die neue K√ºnstlergruppe Die wilde Malerei\\" (\\"The new group of painters: Wild painting\\"), both in Cologne. From 1984 to 1988, he edited the journal \\"Malerei. Peinture. Painting\\", which offered an important forum for the new figurative painters. More than other Neue Wilde painters, however, Szczesny was (and still is) interested in art historical tradition. In a 1985 interview, for instance, Szczesny remarked: \\"If C√©zanne paints Bathers, whom Titian, Delacroix and Courbet had painted before, and Renoir paints them and Picasso paints them again, and Matisse paints them again, then Szczesny, too, paints them again!\\" It is in line with this declaration that in 1982/83, the year after the Neue Wilden explosion, Szczesny ‚Äì in Rome at the time, as the recipient of the Rome Prize of the Prussian Academy of Arts ‚Äì turned his attention to the roots of European art. He created a series of \\"Roman paintings\\" exploring the world of Greco-Roman myth. Similarly, in 1984 he created a number of paintings focusing on the (Ovidian) theme of metamorphosis; these were exhibited in one of Szczesny's largest early exhibitions, alongside ancient sculpture at the Glyptothek and Staatliche Antikensammlung in Munich. The first comprehensive retrospective of Szczesny's work followed in 1988, curated by Klaus Honneff at the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn. In late 80s and early 90s, Szczesny's work was shown in many exhibitions. The artist, during these years, discovered his love of the Caribbean, evinced for instance in his Jamaica paintings of 1990. But Szczesny was engaged in other projects, too. For instance, he painted a series of portraits of personal \\"culture heroes\\", from Bach to James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Glenn Gould and Jimi Hendrix. He also created comprehensive stage designs (e.g. for Gert Pfafferodt's production of Schiller's \\"Kabale und Liebe\\"). = 1994‚Äì2001 = In 1994, Szczesny relocated to New York, setting up his studio at 12 Warren Street. The exposure to the New York art scene (post Andy Warhol) had an important effect on the artist. He began better to understand art as a professional business. One of the results was the founding, in 1996, of the \\"Szczesny Factory\\". The Factory is modelled on the large-scale workshops of the Italian Renaissance and Warhol's Factory. It has since allowed him wide-ranging activities, including book publications, architectural projects and collaborations with fashion labels (such as Escada). Two major art projects implemented during these years (and in the Szczesny Factory framework) were the \\"Kempinski Art Project\\" in 1998, which involved the comprehensive artistic design of the Kempinski Hotel Bahia in Estepona/Marbella; and the \\"Living Planet\\" art project at the Expo 2000 in Hanover, which involved the creation of twelve painted murals, with dimensions of H 300 x W 830 cm each, depicting a map of life and suggesting the importance of protecting endangered species. In the mid-90s, Szczesny also began visiting the island of Mustique. He has travelled there regularly since and has created a number of Mustique-inspired paintings. His relation to Mustique is documented in his book on Mustique (2002). = 2001‚Äì2010 = In 2001, Szczesy moved to Saint-Tropez in South France. In view of Szczesny's love of nature and the Mediterranean. In taking it, he also continued the tradition of painters such as Paul Signac or Henri Matisse who had lived and worked in Saint-Tropez. Shadow sculpture in Saint-Tropez, 2011 In 2001/02, Szczesy spent some time in a studio in Seville, Spain, where he created a number of Flamenco-inspired artworks. In 2002, a film documenting his achievements (\\"Szczesny ‚Äì The film\\", directed by the Austro-American director Curt Faudon) was presented at the 55th Cannes Film Festival. In 2005, Szczesny began producing his so-called \\"shadow sculptures\\", cut from black steel plates and depicting lush vegetation and sensual female figures as symbols of life. In 2007, the exhibition \\"Mainau ‚Äì The dream of an earthly paradise\\" offered a comprehensive overview of Szczesny's wide-ranging artistic output. On the occasion, Szczesny transformed Mainau island into a total work of art, creating a large number of ceramics in various shapes and sizes, large glass stelae and many other objects, including a bridge and a painted zeppelin NT. In 2008, Szczesny began work on a series of \\"golden paintings\\"; in these, Szczesny uses the powerful symbol that is gold and its associations with bounty and glory to celebrate life's beauty. In 2010, Szczesny opened his large new studio in Saint-Tropez. = 2011‚Äìpresent = In 2011, Szczesny began to collaborate with the car company Jaguar, as the company's brand ambassador. The collaboration has allowed the artist to realise major art projects. In 2011, Jaguar presented an exhibition of Szczesny's shadow sculptures in St. Moritz, on Sylt and in Saint-Tropez. In 2012, around a large number of sculptures, ceramics and paintings were shown in Frankfurt (and in particular in Frankfurt‚Äôs Palmengarten). In 2014, a retrospective of the work of Stefan Szczesny is hosted at the Palais des Papes in Avignon. In 2017 the Citadelle de Saint-Tropez hosted a comprehensive sculpture retrospective 2005-2017 by Stefan Szczesny.

Broadcast on Wednesday 17 June 1992 as part of a series of pilots entitled Bunch of Five, it was a surreal sitcom in which two friends, Jim and Bob visit a meat festival taking place in an open field. They are then chased by aliens who want the meat they have bought to feed their queen. Plot In the sole episode The Meat Festival, Bob visits his friend Jim, who has been going through some hard times. For example, his father has been practising with his ouija board, and brought back his uncle and aunt as a pair of geese. They go down to the local pub (The Farting Dashboard) and discover in the newspaper that there is a meat festival taking place (at St. Prontaprint-in-Arndale). They decide to visit the festival, which consists of two tables in an open field. Jim buys a \\"speciality meat product\\" from Phil Oakey. However, some other people try to buy the meat off him. Jim and Bob refuse, but the men keep trying to take the meat away from him. When Jim goes to the pub toilets, he and Bob discover that the men are in fact alien beings with Geordie accents, who claim they need the meat to feed their queen and keep their race alive. Jim and Bob decide to give them the meat, but the police come and attempt to arrest the aliens for stealing other speciality meat products. Jim, Bob and the aliens fight off the police, run away and are led to a garden shed which is in fact the aliens' space ship. Jim and Bob realise that they have forgotten the meat. The police then arrive, but instead of arresting the aliens, give the meat that they left behind. The aliens take the meat and give Jim and Bob a special wish. Jim asks for his uncle and aunt to return to their former selves. The aliens take the meat and leave Earth. When Jim and Bob arrive home, Jim discovers the aliens made his wish come true; his uncle and aunt have returned to their former selves - as foxes. Production The Weekenders was the first television programme created by Reeves and Mortimer following the end of the hugely popular series Vic Reeves Big Night Out. Reeves co-wrote the show with Mortimer under his real name, Jim Moir, which is also the name given to his character. The show was produced as a pilot for Channel 4's Bunch of Five season ‚Äì the network's own version of the BBC's Comedy Playhouse, in which new sitcom ideas were tried out. Out of the five pilots that were broadcast, only one ‚Äì a Frank Skinner sitcom entitled Blue Heaven - was made into a full series. The show co-starred several comedians and actors who were unknown at the time, but had worked with Reeves and Mortimer previously and would go on to become famous. These included John Thomson (credited as \\"John Patrick-Thompson\\"), Simon Day (credited as \\"Tommy Cockles\\") and Paul Whitehouse. The show also featured a guest appearance from Phil Oakey, the frontman for The Human League (credited as \\"Philip Oakey\\"). Reception Channel 4 have claimed to have liked The Weekenders and said they would have been willing to let Reeves and Mortimer do a full series, in exchange for a third series of Vic Reeves Big Night Out. However, Reeves and Mortimer were not willing to do another series, having performed the show on stage and on television for five years. As neither side was willing to compromise, a series was never commissioned. This rejection is considered to be one of the main factors for Reeves and Mortimer moving to the BBC, where they went on to create The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer in 1993, followed by Shooting Stars and Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer. The pilot is seen by fans as an experimental move for Reeves and Mortimer, as it allowed them to perform in a new format - though the duo would not write and perform in another sitcom until Catterick in 2004. As part of Channel 4's Funny Fortnight season, The Weekenders was repeated on Thursday 16 August 2012, preceded by a specially recorded introduction by Reeves and Mortimer. Locations Several scenes were filmed around Greater Manchester, namely in areas such as the Northern Quarter, Trafford, Urmston, and Wythenshawe, whilst The Pack Horse in Bolton is used as the hotel called The Glove.

Small dsRNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are known to be the trigger of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi invariably leads to gene silencing via remodeling of chromatin to thereby suppress transcription, degrading complementary mRNA, or blocking protein translation. Later it was found that dsRNAs can also act to activate transcription and was thus designated saRNA. By targeting selected sequences in gene promoters, saRNAs induce target gene expression at the transcriptional/epigenetic level. saRNAs are typically 21 nucleotides in length with 2 nucleotides overhang at the 3' end of each strand, the same structure as a typical siRNA. To identify an saRNA that can activate a gene of interest, several saRNAs need to be designed within a 1- to 2-kb promoter region by following a set of rules and tested in cultured cells. In some reports, saRNAs are designed in such a way to target non-coding transcripts that overlap the promoter sequence of a protein coding gene. Both chemically synthesized saRNAs and saRNAs expressed as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) have been used in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therapeutic use of saRNAs has been tested in animal models to treat cancer, liver disease, ischemia, and erectile dysfunction. A detailed online resource for small activating RNAs for upregulation of the genes is developed by Dar et al. in 2018 (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/sarna) and published in the Journal of Molecular Biology. In 2016, a phase I clinical trial was launched for the saRNA drug MTL-CEBPA, the first of its kind, to treat liver cancer. References Further reading *Morris KV (2008).

He was a corporate lawyer, investment banker and an investor in various businesses including gold mining. His family are descended from William Bond (Massachusetts) an early 17th-century immigrant from Bury St. Edmunds in East Anglia. He was the son of Hiram Bond M.D. and Almeda Slusser and was married to Laura Ann Higgins. He had two children- Louis Whitford Bond born in New York City, New York in 1865 and Marshall Latham Bond born in Orange, Virginia in 1867. He attended Rushford Academy, Rushford, New York, and earned a bachelor's degree from Hamilton College. He earned much of the money for his own education as a distributor of maps and atlases. Among his successes were becoming a publisher, and taking over the rights to a map of the United States which had been prepared by Matthew Fontaine Maury, a Southerner who was a United States cartography officer. Maury, who decided to join the Confederacy, had left the work unpaid for in New York. He matriculated at Harvard Law School, but before graduation he was hired as a law clerk by Chauncey Depew, a friend and neighbor of his father in law Michael Dunning Higgins of Peekskill. Early investment career Through Depew, he was introduced to and became a broker for John Tobin & Co., part of the powerful Vanderbilt Organization. At Tobin & Co. he was the floor broker for Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and his son William Henry Vanderbilt on the New York Gold Exchange executing their trading in \\"greenbacks\\" and gold during the Civil War. The value of greenbacks against gold varied widely as investors altered their perception on the progress of the war. Greenbacks United States Notes sold at a discounted price in comparison to gold. However, if chances of victory rose they became perceived as a business opportunity. For the most part however, if the war was dragging on, people wanted the security of gold. Vanderbilt employed a private intelligence network on the front line reporting early news. Hiram Bond's position led to his prominent contacts on Wall Street, in the military, and in politics. He is described by Professor Richard Lowe as having financial dealings during the Civil War with Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Among the other investment houses acting in collaboration with Commodore Vanderbilt and Tobin, and that Hiram Bond was acquainted with, was that of Leonard Jerome who was the grandfather of Winston Churchill. First National Petroleum Towards the end of the Civil War Hiram Bond acted as the Treasurer in a company First National Petroleum formed to roll up oil leases in the state of West Virginia. The bankers for the company were Duncan, Sherman & Company a boutique which had represented the London banking house of George Peabody and Junius Morgan. John Pierpont Morgan had served his apprenticeship there previous to the death of Peabody but had left to form J. P. Morgan and Company. Judgeship Orange County Courthouse and Confederate monument Hiram Bond was appointed to a federal judgeship in Orange County, Virginia in 1866 under Reconstruction. He was known as Judge Bond to many though his judicial offices ended in 1872. He was of importance in assisting a shift from an Accommodationist Francis Harrison Pierpont to a Radical Republican Governor Henry H. Wells. He was resented by many former Confederate Whites for his support of Civil Rights for Blacks. In 1868 he was appointed to the position of Master of Bankruptcy for the state of Virginia by President Ulysses S. Grant. This position was based at the state capital, Richmond, Va. While living there he hosted a visit by Supreme Court Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. His family remained living at Mayhurst Plantation House in Orange. Business dealings =Denver= In 1870 Judge Bond started visiting Denver and the other parts of Colorado on business. On the evening of January 14, 1872 he was among local notables invited by the Governor to be attendants at a ball held for Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia. On the 15th the group hunted Buffalo with Buffalo Bill. Later in the year Hiram Bond purchased a small ranch on the outskirts of the town named Villa Park, Denver, Colorado where he acted as a cattle broker. The same year he organized the Denver Smelting and Refining Works with Joseph Miner and Denver Mayor Joseph E. Bates processing ore into lead and gold for ingots for the Denver Mint. The Villa Park property was sold to Helen Barnum Hurd Buchtel daughter of P. T. Barnum founder of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1879. The Barnums then operated the Bond's Villa Park House as a hotel. Hiram Bond's Denver homesite and yard are now called Paco Sanchez Park. While engaged in cattle brokerage with his brother in law he also practiced law. Judge Hiram Bond practiced law specializing in mining and ranching, he also dealt in real estate. = The Grape Sugar Trust = In 1881 Judge Hiram Bond became involved with the Des Moines, Iowa corn starch and glucose producer the New York Grape Sugar Corporation. The other founding officers included Theodore Havemeyer of the Havemeyer Brothers led by Henry O. Havemeyer the largest sugar refiners in the United States. Among the other principals were the New York State Republican Boss Thomas C. Platt, patent lawyer Edward N. Dickerson, a Philadelphia group composed of businessmen William West Frazier of Rittenhouse Square, Frazier's brother in law William Crawford Sheldon and his son in law Alfred Craven Harrison. Frazier, Sheldon and Harrison had a banking business in New York and an established business Franklin Sugar Company which imported and refined sugar in Pennsylvania. William Crawford Sheldon's daughter Gertrude was later the wife of Richard Whitney President of the New York Stock Exchange. Judge Bond helped distribute the stock exchanging some with Charles D. Arms of Youngstown, Ohio for shares in Grand Central Mining. There was a resulting court case as to whether Judge Hiram Bond had exchanged those shares with Charles Arms as an individual or as a member of the partnership of Kimberly & Arms. This case eventually went all the way to the United States Supreme Court. = Kings County Elevated Railway = View of Fulton Ferry, L.I. From U.S. Hotel, New York 1845 Between 1879 and 1887 Judge Hiram Bond was also chief officer of a firm financed by investors from Boston led by Willard T. Sears and Moses Kimball. This firm had acquired rights to construct an urban transit system under the name Kings County Elevated Railway. This line was to run from the Fulton Ferry Terminal inland to the Queens border at City Line. Williard T. Sears was an architect who was able to add value designing the overpasses and bridges. Their package of rights and initial construction was eventually sold off to New York City investors led by Gen. James Jourdan due to the lack of support for the Bostonians by the local political leaders. Due to the persistence of Jourdan the project eventually got off the ground. The company directors besides Jourdan were Edward A. Abbott, Henry J. Davison, Harvey Farrington, Wendell Goodwin, Henry J. Robinson, James O. Sheldon and William A. Read. William A. Read was the financier whose company Read & Company later became Dillon, Read. Hiram's association with the KCER was so well known that it was commonly referred to as \\"Judge Bond's Road\\" according to the New York Times. During this period of time he was inducted into the Players Club at Gramercy Park founded by actor Edwin Booth for actors and lovers of the theater. He was also a member of the Union League Club of New York and Lawyers Club of New York. During this time he maintained an office at 115 Broadway in Manhattan and a townhouse in Brooklyn. = Alabama; Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Co. = As a result of the ethical performance of his position being Master of Bankruptcy for Virginia he was respected there and in the South even by many former Confederates despite being a Radical Republican. This led to Judge Hiram Bonds involvement with the northern Alabama coal mining industry. He began by purchasing a house at Decatur and helping form a new company Decatur Land Improvement and Furnace Company there in 1887 as vice president and general manager. This company was formed with Major Eugene C. Gordon the brother of Governor John Brown Gordon of Georgia. He then became involved with Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Judge Hiram Bond was the Chief Operating Officer of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company from 1889 to 1891. The TCI resulted from a combine of interests between a number of coal, coke and iron operations in Tennessee and Northern Alabama. Judge Bond was made an officer at the same time as John C. Brown a former General and Governor of Tennessee. The largest holders of the company stock were in two groups, one being led by a Southerner John H. Inman, the other group by New York State Republican Boss Thomas C. Platt. On Gov. Brown's death he was replaced as President by Platt. The Southerners won out in time though due to discomfort the Northerners felt over convict leasing and the poor initial performance of the stock. The Inman's removed Bond from his office, but by then he was already doing projects in other places. = Seattle, Monte Cristo Mine = Plan for the station at Monte Cristo dated 1892, likely one of Barlow's original drawings. Hiram Bond became active in the mining and lumber industries and real estate in Washington in the early 1990s. Among his promotions were two companies based on mining near Monte Cristo Peak in the Cascades, Monte Cristo Mining & Milling Co. and the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway. This package of corporations, real estate and mining patents was sold off to John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller had his representatives execute development of the mine, a railroad extension to the mine and a town. Among those who participated later in the period of opportunity at Monte Cristo was Frederick Trump (father of Fred Trump and grandfather of Donald Trump), who opened the first Trump Real Estate Office and Trump Hotel there. The lumber for the construction of that first Trump Hotel was purchased from Monte Cristo Mining & Milling while it was owned by Rockefeller. The mine there turned out to be marginal and Bond's sale showed good foresight. = Santa Clara Prune Industry = Beginning in 1895 Judge Hiram Bond and a younger brother Elmer Monroe Bond a New York City wholesale produce dealer were involved in a fruit packing business in Santa Clara, California. There had been wide price swings in the price of prunes depending on the time since last harvest. Judge Bond constructed warehouses, set up a bank Citizens Bank of Santa Clara and he bought New Park Estate formerly the property of James Pieronnet Pierce. A fruit industry association he helped found and headed California Cured Fruit Association negotiated prices which increased due to storage and slow sale. The business succeeded until a bumper crop in 1903 proved too much to store. While in Santa Clara Hiram Bond was a cofounder of the Garden City Athletic Club (a gym). He was also a member of the Saint Claire Club of San Jose, the Burlingame Country Club of Burlingame and the Pacific-Union Club in nearby San Francisco. At this time the Bonds also maintained a string of polo ponies among the Judge and his two sons playing at Coyote Point Park in San Mateo. At the time of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 Santa Clara's water towers were knocked down and the community was supplied from the Bond's reservoir. He maintained an Irish coachman Nace, a carriage and a limousine which was used by his wife after his death whose California chauffeurs license number was 226. = New York Again, American Mechanical Cashier = Among his last positions was President of the American Mechanical Cashier Corporation which had a plant in Jersey City, New Jersey an office at 40 Wall Street and a flagship store on Broadway. AMCC provided a suite for him at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Among the others involved in the company were former Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Charles S. Fairchild and investment banker Henry L. Horton father in law of Edward F. Hutton. The company was developing a proprietary cash register and had acquired the Isaac S. Dement machine stenography patents. Among those friends of the family who considered investing in AMCC was John Jacob Astor IV. The main near term business however was refurbishing some used registers made by the NCR Corporation that users obtained title to at the end of their leases. NCR wanted clients to upgrade with new machines under a new lease from NCR. Col. John H. Patterson financed Thomas Watson to set up a front company Watsons which would compete in that market with predatory practices. So AMCC was driven into bankruptcy and acquired by Watson's. The matter generated an anti-trust action after which Watson left to set up IBM. Among the injured investors in AMCC was Mark Twain.  Jack London and the Bonds  Judge Bond is chiefly remembered as the basis for the character Judge Miller in Jack London's novel \\"The Call of the Wild\\". Judge Bond's sons were Louis Bond and Marshall Bond who were mining engineers educated at Yale and Stanford. The Bonds owned the cabin and tent pitch overlooking Dawson City, in the Northwest Territory where Jack London had lived on a work exchange during the Fall of 1897 and part of the Spring of 1898. The Bond brothers had also owned the sled dogs that London used in Dawson for the Bonds and other of his clients. One of their dogs was the basis for the character Buck. London visited Marshall Bond at New Park Judge Bond's Ranch in 1901 at Santa Clara which included a plum orchard, vineyard and winery as well pasture for a string of polo ponies. The Call of the Wild begins with a description of the place. Buck lived at a big house in the sun- kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half-hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon  Sources  *Marshall Bond Papers.

It took place in either 469 or 466 BCE, in the vicinity of the mouth of the Eurymedon River (now the K√∂pr√º√ßay) in Pamphylia, Asia Minor. It forms part of the Wars of the Delian League, itself part of the larger Greco-Persian Wars. The Delian League had been formed between Athens and many of the city-states of the Aegean to continue the war with Persia, which had begun with the first and second Persian invasions of Greece (492-490 and 480-479 BCE, respectively). In the aftermath of the Battles of Plataea and Mycale, which had ended the second invasion, the Greek Allies had taken the offensive, besieging the cities of Sestos and Byzantium. The Delian League then took over responsibility for the war, and continued to attack Persian bases in the Aegean throughout the next decade. In either 469 or 466 BCE, the Persians began assembling a large army and navy for a major offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, it is possible that the expedition aimed to move up the coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general Cimon took 200 triremes and sailed to Phaselis in Pamphylia, which eventually agreed to join the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective. Cimon then moved to pre-emptively attack the Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing into the mouth of the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet gathered there. Most of the Persian fleet made landfall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BCE. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention. Sources and chronology Thucydides, whose history provides many of the details of this period Unfortunately, the military history of Greece between the end of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece.Finley, p. 16.Kagan, p. 77. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporary with it, is Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account.Sealey, p. 264.Fine, p. 336.Finley, pp. 29-30. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates.Sealey, pp. 248-250Fine, p. 343. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed. Much extra detail for the period is provided by Plutarch, in his biographies of Aristides and especially Cimon. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements.e.g. Themistocles 25 has a direct reference to Thucydides I, 137 In his biographies, he explicitly draws on many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that Thucydides's brief account omits. The final major extant source for the period is the universal history (Bibliotheca historica) of the 1st century BC Sicilian, Diodorus Siculus. Much of Diodorus's writing concerning this period seems to be derived from the much earlier Greek historian Ephorus, who also wrote a universal history.Fine, p. 360. However, from what little we know of Ephorus, historians are generally disparaging towards his history. Diodorus, who has often been dismissed by modern historians,Green, p. xxiv. is therefore not a particularly good source for this period. Indeed, one of his translators, Oldfather, says of Diodorus's account of the Eurymedon campaign that \\"...the three preceding chapters reveal Diodorus in the worst light...\\".Oldfather, note to Diodorus XI, 62 There is also a reasonable body of archaeological evidence for the period, of which inscriptions detailing probable tribute lists of the Delian League are particularly important.Fine, pp. 357-358. =Chronology= Thucydides provides a succinct list of the main events occurring between the end of the second Persian invasion and the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, but almost no chronological information.Sealey, p. 248. Various attempts have been made to reassemble the chronology, but there is no definitive answer. The assumption central to these attempts is that Thucydides is describing the events in the appropriate chronological order.Fine, p. 344. The one firmly accepted date is 465 BC for the beginning of the Siege of Thasos. This is based on an ancient scholiast's annotation of a copy of Aeschines's works. The scholiast notes that the Athenians met disaster at the 'Nine-Ways' in the archonship of Lysitheus (known to be 465/464 BC). Thucydides mentions this attack on the 'Nine-Ways' in connection with the beginning of the Siege of Thasos, and since Thucydides says that the siege ended in its third year, the Siege of Thasos therefore dates to c.465-463 BC.Sealey, p. 250. The Battle of Eurymedon has been dated to 469 BC by Plutarch's anecdote about the Archon Apsephion (469/468 BC) choosing Cimon and his fellow generals as judges in a competition.Plutarch, Cimon, 8 The implication is that Cimon had recently achieved a great victory, and the most likely candidate is Eurymedon. However, since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred after the Athenian siege of Naxos (but before the Siege of Thasos), the date of Eurymedon is clearly constrained by the date of Naxos. Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this Naxos,Perrin, note to Plutarch, Themistocles, 25Kagan, p. 45. another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC.Fine, pp. 338-342. Since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred before Thasos, the alternative date for this battle would therefore be 466 BC. Modern historians are split, some supporting 469 BC as the most likely date,Kagan, p. 47. and others opting for 466 BC.Holland, p. 363.Fine, p. 345. Background The Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and in particular Ionia, by the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city.Holland, pp. 147-151. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline.Fine, pp. 269-277. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy.Herodotus V, 35 This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.Holland, pp. 155-157. Map showing main events of the Ionian Revolt and the Persian invasions of Greece The Greek states of Athens and Eretria allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of Sardis.Holland, pp. 160-162. After this, the Ionian Revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king Darius the Great decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt.Holland, pp. 175-177. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria. In the next two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, including some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed.Holland, pp. 183-186. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon.Holland, pp. 187-194. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I.Holland, pp. 202-203. Xerxes then led the second invasion personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece.Holland, pp. 240-244. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium on land and at sea respectively.Holland, pp. 276-281. All of Greece except the Peloponnesus thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis.Holland, pp. 320-326. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.Holland, pp. 342-355. According to tradition, on the same day as Plataea, the Allied fleet defeated the demoralised remnants of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Mycale.Holland, pp. 357-358. This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, the Greek counterattack.Lazenby, p. 247. After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them.Thucydides I, 89 The Allied fleet then sailed to the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of Sestos.Herodotus IX, 114 The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of Byzantium (modern day Istanbul). The siege was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general Pausanias alienated many of the Allies, and resulted in Pausanias's recall.Thucydides I, 95 The siege of Byzantium was the last action of the Hellenic alliance that defeated the Persian invasion. Athens and her empire in 431 BC. The Athenian Empire was the direct descendant of the Delian League After Byzantium, Sparta was eager to end her involvement in the war. The Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible.Holland, p. 362. The loose alliance of city states that fought against Xerxes's invasion was dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league. With the Spartan withdrawal, the leadership of the Greeks now explicitly passed to the Athenians. A congress was called on the holy island of Delos to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians. This alliance, now including many of the Aegean islands, was formally constituted as the 'First Athenian Alliance', commonly known as the Delian League. According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to \\"avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king.\\"Thucydides I, 96 Forces of the Delian League spent much of the next decade expelling the remaining Persian garrisons from Thrace, and expanding the Aegean territory controlled by the League. Prelude Once the Persian forces in Europe had largely been neutralised, the Athenians seem to have gone about starting to extend the League in Asia Minor.Plutarch, Cimon, 12Cawkwell, p. 133. The islands of Samos, Chios and Lesbos seem to have become members of the original Hellenic alliance after Mycale, and presumably were also therefore original members of the Delian League.Herodotus IX, 106 However, it is unclear exactly when the other Ionian cities, or indeed the other Greek cities of Asia Minor, joined the league, though they certainly did at some point.Sealey, p. 247. Thucydides attests the presence of Ionians at Byzantium in 478 BC, so it is possible that at least some of the Ionian cities joined the league in early 478 BC.Fine, p. 332. The Athenian politician Aristides was said to have died in Pontus (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into Asia Minor.Plutarch, Aristides, 25-26 Cimon's Eurymedon campaign itself seems to have begun in response to the assembly of a large Persian fleet and army at Aspendos, near the mouth of the Eurymedon River. It is usually argued that the Persians were the would-be aggressors, and that Cimon's campaign was launched to deal with this new threat.Powell, p. 19-20. Cawkwell suggests that the Persian build-up was the first concerted attempt to counter the activity of the Greeks since the failure of the second invasion. It is possible that internal strife within the Persian empire had contributed to the length of time it took to launch this campaign.Cawkwell, p. 132. Cawkwell outlines the Persian strategic problems: > \\"Persia was a land power which used its naval forces in close conjunction > with its armies, not free ranging in enemy waters. In any case, secure naval > bases were necessary. In the Ionian Revolt with land forces already > operating in Ionia and elsewhere along the Aegean seaboard, it was easy for > a Royal army and navy to deal with the revolt, but in view of the general > revolt of the [Ionian] cities in 479 BC and the subsequent successes of the > Greek navies the only way for Persia must have seemed to be to move along > the coast restoring order in city after city, with fleet and army moving > together.\\"Cawkwell, p. 135. The nature of naval warfare in the Ancient world, dependent as it was on large teams of rowers, meant that ships would have to make landfall every few days to resupply with food and water.Gardiner, pp. 219-220 This severely limited the range of an Ancient fleet, and essentially meant that navies could only operate in the vicinity of secure naval bases.Pryor, p. 70. Cawkwell therefore suggests that the Persian forces gathered at Aspendos were aiming to move along the southern coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city, until eventually the Persian navy could begin operating in Ionia again. Alexander the Great would employ this strategy in reverse in winter of 333 BC. Lacking a navy with which to take on the Persians, Alexander settled instead for denying the Persian navy suitable bases, by capturing the ports of southern Asia Minor. Plutarch says that upon hearing that the Persian forces were gathering at Aspendos, Cimon sailed from Cnidus (in Caria) with 200 triremes. It is highly likely that Cimon had assembled this force because the Athenians had had some warning of a forthcoming Persian campaign to re-subjugate the Asiatic Greeks. Certainly, no other league business would have required such a great force. Cimon may have been waiting in Caria because he expected the Persians to march straight into Ionia, along the Royal road from Sardis. According to Plutarch, Cimon sailed with these 200 triremes to the Greek city of Phaselis (in Lycia) but was refused admittance. He therefore began ravaging the lands of Phaselis, but with the mediation of the Chian contingent of his fleet, the people of Phaselis agreed to join the league. They were to contribute troops to the expedition, and to pay the Athenians ten talents. The fact that Cimon pre- emptively sailed to and captured Phaselis suggests that he anticipated a Persian campaign to capture the coastal cities (as outlined above). The presence of both army and navy at Aspendos may have persuaded him that there was to be no immediate assault on Ionia. By capturing Phaselis, the furthest east Greek city in Asia Minor (and just to the west of the Eurymedon), he effectively blocked the Persian campaign before it had begun, denying them the first naval base they needed to control. Taking further initiative, Cimon then moved to directly attack the Persian fleet at Aspendos. Opposing forces =Greek= Reconstructed model of a trireme, the type of ship in use by both the Greek and Persian forces According to Plutarch, the League fleet consisted of 200 triremes. These were of the sleek Athenian aphract (deckless) design, originally developed by Themistocles primarily for ramming actions,Goldsworthy, p. 102. although they had been modified by Cimon to improve their suitability for boarding actions. The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines.Lazenby, p. 46. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines,Herodotus VII, 184 and this was probably very true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 40-45 soldiers--triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight.Goldsworthy, p. 103. There were therefore probably around 5,000 hoplite marines with the League fleet. =Persian= Several different estimates for the size of the Persian fleet are given. Thucydides says that there was a fleet of 200 Phoenician ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source.Cawkwell, p. 134. Plutarch gives numbers of 350 from Ephorus and 600 from Phanodemus. Furthermore, Plutarch says that the Persian fleet was awaiting 80 Phoenician ships sailing from Cyprus. Although Thucydides's account is generally to be favoured, there may an element of truth in Plutarch's assertion that the Persians were awaiting further reinforcements; this would explain why Cimon was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them.Hooper, p. 174. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for the size of the Persian land army. However, the number of Persian marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of Greek marines (c. 5,000), since the Persian ships carried the same complement of troops. Plutarch quotes Ephorus as saying that Tithraustes was commander of the royal fleet, and Pherendatis of the infantry, but says that Callisthenes named Ariomandes as overall commander. Battle The Persian archer on the Eurymedon vase. On the reverse is a naked ithyphallic Greek warrior. An inscription on the vase states ŒµœçœÅœÖŒºŒ≠Œ¥ŒøŒΩ ŒµŒπŒº[√≠] Œ∫œÖŒ≤Œ±[---] Œ≠œÉœÑŒµŒ∫Œ± \\"I am Eurymedon, I stand bent forward\\", in probable reference to the Persian defeat and humiliation at the Battle of the Eurymedon.Schauenburg 1975, restoring the third word as Œ∫œÖŒ≤Œ¨Œ¥Œµ, perhaps related to Œ∫œçŒ≤Œ¥Œ±, the term connoting the bent- over, rear-entry position associated with a 3-obol prostitute, see J. Davidson, Courtesans and Fishcakes, 1998, p.170. Eurymedon vase, made circa 460 BC. Thucydides gives only the barest of details for this battle; the most reliable detailed account is given by Plutarch. According to Plutarch, the Persian fleet was anchored off the mouth of the Eurymedon, awaiting the arrival of 80 Phoenician ships from Cyprus. Cimon, sailing from Phaselis, made to attack the Persians before the reinforcements arrived, whereupon the Persian fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when Cimon continued to bear down on the Persians, they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, the Persian battle line was quickly breached, and the Persian ships then turned about, and made for the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby. Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the naval battle, but it seems likely that most were able to land. The Persian army now began to move towards the Greek fleet, which had presumably also grounded itself in order to capture the Persian ships. Despite the weariness of his troops after this first battle, Cimon, seeing \\"that his men were exalted by the impetus and pride of their victory, and eager to come to close quarters with the Barbarians\\", landed the marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army. Initially the Persian line held the Athenian assault, but eventually, as at the Battle of Mycale, the heavily armoured hoplites proved superior, and routed the Persian army. Fleeing back to their camp, the Persians were then captured, along with their camp, by the victorious Greeks.Plutarch, Cimon, 13 Thucydides says that 200 Phoenician ships were captured and destroyed.Thucydides I, 100 It is highly unlikely that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, but it is not clear that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side. Plutarch says that, following his double victory, \\"though like a powerful athlete he had brought down two contests in one day...Cimon still went on competing with his own victories.\\" Cimon supposedly sailed with the Greek fleet as quickly as possible to intercept the fleet of 80 Phoenician ships the Persians had expected. Taking them by surprise, he captured or destroyed the entire fleet. However, Thucydides does not mention this subsidiary action, and some have cast doubt on whether it actually happened. Aftermath According to Plutarch, one tradition had it that the Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in the aftermath of the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC.Fine, p. 363. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.see Cawkwell, pp. 137-138, note 13. The Eurymedon was a highly significant victory for the Delian League, which probably ended once and for all the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. It also seems to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC.Cawkwell, pp. 132-134. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.Hornblower, pp. 22-23. Despite Cimon's massive victory, something of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks do not appear to have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity.Powell, pp. 19-20. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persians would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.Thucydides I, 110 References Bibliography =Primary sources= *Herodotus, The Histories *Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War *Xenophon, Hellenica *Diodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica *Plutarch, Parallel Lives ‚Äî Aristides, Cimon, Themistocles *Ctesias, Persica (from Photios's Epitome) =Secondary sources=        469 BC 466 BC 460s BC conflicts Wars involving ancient Greece Eurymedon Eurymedon Eurymedon Amphibious operations Eurymedon Wars of the Delian League Battles involving Phoenicia ","title":"Battle of the Eurymedon"},{"id":"15982016","title":"The Word Girl"},{"id":"15982026","text":"Ken Hedt (15 November 1936 - 16 May 2006) was an Australian rules footballer, who played in the Victorian Football League for Collingwood.

Band history Balkan was formed in 1982 in Novi Sad by the guitarist and vocalist Aleksandar Cvetkoviƒá, a former Leki frontman. The band's sound was hard rock-oriented, but also featured elements of ska and new wave, and the lyrics were inspired by the lyrics of Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Branimir ≈†tuliƒá and dealt with the problems of the working class. Initially, Balkan performed as an opening band on Divlje Jagode, Riblja ƒåorba, Parni Valjak, Drugi Naƒçin, Galija and Atomsko Skloni≈°te concerts in Vojvodina. Cvetkoviƒá recorded Balkan's debut album Gola istina (Bare Truth) with ≈Ωeljko Jerkoviƒá (guitar), Sa≈°a Zavi≈°iƒá (bass guitar) and Radivoj Bugarski (drums). The album was produced by a former Pop Ma≈°ina member Robert Nemeƒçek. It featured the song \\"Tridesetpeta-≈°esta\\" Cvetkoviƒá wrote in 1971 and dedicated to his father. Balkan's second album Na brdovitom Balkanu (On the Mountainous Balkans), released in 1983, was also produced by Nemeƒçek, and besides Cvetkoviƒá and Jerkoviƒá featured Zlatko Maru≈°iƒá (bass guitar) and Miroslav Papiƒá (drums). Na brdovitom Balkanu featured lyrics dealing with similar subjects as on Gola istina. In 1985 Balkan released the album Homo Balcanicus, produced by Srƒëan Marjanoviƒá, which also featured lyrics about the poor. On June 15 of the same year, Balkan, alongside 23 other acts, performed on Red Star Stadium, on the concert which was a part of YU Rock Misija, a Yugoslav contribution to Live Aid. After a longer break, in 1989, Balkan, now featuring Cvetkoviƒá, Jerkoviƒá, Bugarski, ≈Ωeljko Glamoƒçanin (bass guitar), and Zoran Vasiljeviƒá (keyboards), recorded the album Kome verovati (Who to Trust) with lyrics filled with disappointment and pessimism. The album features the song \\"Tridesetpeta-≈°esta II deo\\", which tells the story of Cvetkoviƒá's father who found peace after his death. Album was produced by Cvetkoviƒá and Milan ƒÜiriƒá.

Franz Hettinger (13 January 1819, at Aschaffenburg ‚Äì 26 January 1890, at W√ºrzburg) was a German Catholic theologian.  Life  He attended the gymnasium in his native city and afterwards, from 1836 to 1839, the academy in the same city, where he finished philosophy and began theology. As the teaching of the latter science was discontinued in this academy in 1839, he entered the ecclesiastical seminary at W√ºrzburg and continued his studies there from the autumn of 1839 to that of 1841. Acting on the advice of Bishop Georg Anton Stahl of W√ºrzburg, who had taught him Christian doctrine in the gymnasium of Aschaffenburg, and had then been his professor of dogmatic theology at W√ºrzburg until 1840, he went to Rome in the fall of 1841 for a four years' course in the German College. Here he was ordained on 2 September 1843, by Cardinal Patrizi, and upon the completion of his studies, in 1845, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. In the first volume of his work, Aus Welt und Kirche, Hettinger gives an account of his student days in Rome. After his return home, he was made chaplain at Alzenau, 3 October 1845. On 25 October 1847, he was appointed assistant, and on 20 May 1852, subregent, in the ecclesiastical seminary of W√ºrzburg. On 1 June 1856, he became extraordinary professor, and on 16 May 1857, ordinary professor, of patrology and propaedeutics in the University of W√ºrzburg. He took up the teaching of apologetics and homiletics, with the direction of the homiletic seminary, on 1 January 1867. From 1871 he lectured on dogmatic theology in the place of Denzinger, whose health had failed, and after the latter's death, he became ordinary professor of dogmatic theology (16 Dec., 1884). In 1859 he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the philosophical faculty of W√ºrzburg. Twice, 1862‚Äì63 and 1867‚Äì68, he was rector of the university. Hettinger and his colleagues, Joseph Hergenr√∂ther and Denzinger, formed a brilliant constellation to which the theological faculty of W√ºrzburg owed the high repute which it enjoyed for many years. Hettinger's merits were also recognized abroad. He was made an honorary member of the college of doctors of the theological faculty of the University of Vienna in 1866, honorary doctor of theology of Louvain in 1884, and, in 1885, honorary member of the Academia Religionis Catholic√¶ of Rome. He was called to Rome with Hergenr√∂ther in 1868 to assist in the preliminary work of the First Vatican Council, and appointed consultor to the theologico-dogmatic commission. On 21 November 1879, he was appointed a domestic prelate by Pope Leo XIII. Works He was a distinguished scholar and writer of wide culture. His Apologie des Christenthums, was published in 2 vols. in 5 parts (Freiburg im Br., 1863‚Äì67; 2nd ed., 1815‚Äì67; 3rd ed., 1867‚Äì69; 4th ed., 1871‚Äì73; 5th ed., 1875‚Äì80; 6th ed., 1885‚Äì87). After the death of Hettinger, his pupil, Professor Eugen M√ºller, of Strasburg, prepared the further editions in 5 vols.; 7th ed., 1895‚Äì98; 8th ed., 1899‚Äì1900; 9th ed., 1906-8. It was translated into French, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. This work was not intended for theologians alone, but also for circulation among people of culture generally. It is an important production of apologetic literature. This was followed by the more strictly scientific \\"Lehrbuch der Fundamental-Theologie oder Apologetik\\" (2 parts, Freiburg, 1879; 2nd ed. in 1 vol., 1888). If we except the \\"Apologie des Christenthums\\", the work \\"Aus Welt und Kirche; Bilder und Skizzen\\" had the widest circulation of any of Hettinger's writings (2 vols., Freiburg, 1885; 2nd ed., 1887; 3rd ed., 1893; 4th ed., 1897; 5th ed., 1902). It was the fruit of time in Italy, and particularly Rome, and of his other vacation trips through various parts of Germany, Austria (especially Tyrol), Switzerland, and France. Some of the sketches of travel from which this work was compiled appeared first in various issues of the \\"Historisch-politische Bl√§tter\\" (1874‚Äì84). His study of Dante inspired the following productions: *\\"Grundidee und Charakter der g√∂ttlichen Kom√∂die von Dante Alighieri\\" (Bonn, 1876); *\\"Die Theologie der g√∂ttlichen Kom√∂die des Dante Alighieri in ihren Grundz√ºgen dargestellt\\" (Cologne, 1879); *\\"Die g√∂ttliche Kom√∂die des Dante Alighieri nach ihrem wesentlichen Inhalt und Charakter dargestellt.

Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. detective film, directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Frank Sinatra, Raquel Welch, Richard Conte, Martin Gabel, Lainie Kazan, Pat Henry, and Dan Blocker. A sequel to the 1967 film Tony Rome, and based on the novel by Marvin H. Albert, Lady in Cement was released on November 20, 1968. Plot While diving off the Miami coast seeking one of the 11 fabled Spanish galleons sunk in 1591, private investigator Tony Rome (Sinatra) discovers a dead woman, her feet encased in cement (concrete), at the bottom of the ocean. Rome reports this to Lieutenant Dave Santini (Conte) and thinks nothing more of the incident, until Waldo Gronski (Blocker) hires him to find a missing woman, Sandra Lomax. Gronski has little money, so he allows Rome to pawn his watch to retain his services. After investigating the local hotspots and picking up on a few names, Rome soon comes across Kit Forrest (Raquel Welch), whose party Sandra Lomax was supposed to have attended. Rome's talking to Forrest raises the ire of racketeer Al Mungar (Gabel), a supposedly reformed gangster who looks after Kit's interests. Thinking a connection may exist between Lomax, Forrest, and Mungar, Rome starts probing into their backgrounds and begins a romantic relationship with Kit. With both cops and crooks chasing him and the omnipresent Gronski breathing down his neck, Rome finds himself deep in a case that provides few answers.

Following the success of Tony Rome, Aaron Rosenberg hired Marvin Albert to adapt Cement for Sinatra. The actor made it after The Detective. Raquel Welch's casting was announced in June 1967. Sammy Davis Jr was to have appeared in the film as the charter-boat captain. Sinatra fell ill, though, and filming was postponed for four weeks. Davis was replaced by Pat Henry in the final film. Dan Blocker was given time away from Bonanza to play his part. The movie gave an early role to Lainie Kazan. Welch later said she did not realize her character was an alcoholic until after filming wrapped. \\"I'm watching this movie and I'm thinking, 'What the hell has she got on?' At one point, I had this epiphany: 'Oh, she's an alcoholic!' I didn't know that. How could I miss that?... I think I was just so enamored with Frank Sinatra, you know. He's hypnotic.\\" Filming started in March 1968. Before and during filming, Sinatra was performing at the Fontainebleau in Miami over a six-week period. Welch went to watch him, and found the experience so inspiring, she determined to continue to perform to live audiences in her career. Reception =Box office= According to Fox records, the film required $7,150,000 in rentals to break even, and by 11 December 1970, had made $6,825,000, which made a loss for the studio. =Critical reception= Opening to mixed reviews, Lady in Cement is generally considered to be a middling sequel to Tony Rome. Critic Roger Ebert gave faint praise in a generally scathing review by commenting: \\"In the movie's few good scenes, Sinatra once again painfully reminds us what a controlled, effective actor he is.\\" Variety noted that \\"Dan Blocker is excellent as a sympathetic heavy\\", while John Maloney liked the \\"fresher script\\" and \\"sharp direction.\\" Home media Lady on Cement was released on DVD on May 24, 2005, as part of a boxed set along with Tony Rome and The Detective, both also directed by Douglas.

She was sunk in a storm on what should have been an ordinary voyage to Victoria, British Columbia. Construction Clallam was built in 1903 at the shipyard of Edward Heath (1864‚Äì1934) in Tacoma. Clallam was 168' long, 32' on the beam, with 13' depth of hold and rated at 657-tons. She was propeller-driven and built of Douglas fir, with an compound engine which allowed her to cruise at . She had 44 staterooms.Newell, Gordon R., Ships of the Inland Sea, at 136-142, Binford and Mort, Portland, OR (2nd Ed. 1960)‚ÄúThe SS Clallam founders in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on January 8, 1904, with a loss of 56 lives‚Äù, HistoryLink.org Clallam was commissioned by the Puget Sound Navigation Company to run with another steamer, Majestic on the route from Tacoma to Seattle, Port Townsend and Victoria. During her launching on April 15, 1903, the woman who swung the bottle of champagne at her bow missed, and when the U.S flag was unfurled, it was upside down, in the sign of distress. These were deemed unlucky signs by the superstitious among the waterfront and marine trades.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 90, 100, 145, 392 and 433, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Sinking =Premonition= Known as \\"the bell sheep's premonition\\" after the fact; an odd event occurred to the Clallam in Seattle as she was loading her northbound passengers and freight at Pier 1, at the foot of Yesler Way. Black Ball Line steamers often carried sheep bound for Port Townsend and Victoria along with a trained mascot or bell sheep which always led the herd aboard. On this occasion, the bell sheep that usually made the voyage absolutely refused to board the vessel and was finally left behind when the ship departed Seattle at 8:30 a.m. =Last seen in distress= Capt. George Roberts (photograph taken before 1895) On the morning of Friday, January 8, 1904, Clallam left Tacoma on her regular run, in command of Capt. George Roberts, then 55 years old and a veteran of 29 years marine service.Kline, M.S., and Bayless, G.A., Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at 69-71, Bayless Books, Seattle, WA 1983 She picked up passengers and freight, first in Seattle, then Port Townsend, where she cleared customs, then at 12:15 departed Port Townsend, heading north across the Strait of Juan de Fuca bound for Victoria. Clallam should have reached Victoria at about 4:00 p.m.‚ÄúSteamer Clallam Breaks Down in Strait ‚Äì Has Not Been Reported as Sighted Up Till One O‚ÄôClock This Morning‚Äù, Port Townsend Morning Leader, January 9, 1904 The wind was rising as she left, and eventually reached speeds of up to an hour in the Straits and up to an hour further west at Tatoosh Island at the entrance to the strait. Still, Clallam nearly reached safety, as about 5:00 p.m. she was seen from the Canada coast, near Trial Island dead in the water and rolling heavily. Afterwards she was observed to be running eastwards before the wind, away from Vancouver Island towards the San Juan Islands.‚ÄúClallam Founders ‚Äì Fifty-six lives lost as result of Friday‚Äôs Terrible Storm‚Äù Port Townsend Morning Leader, January 10, 1904 =Search efforts mounted= The company's agent at Victoria, Edward E. Blackwood, seeing Clallam in distress, began a frantic effort to find a tug to go out to her. All the Canadian seagoing tugs were absent from port, and the little harbor tugs refused to go out into the gale. The little Canadian steamer Iroquois was docked at Sidney, on Vancouver Island. Blackwood was able to get word to the Iroquois' master that Clallam was missing and he agreed to take his vessel out into the storm to search for her. Waves broke clear over the bridge on Iroquois. Unable to find Clallam, Iroquois returned to port at midnight, or 11:00 p.m. (Iroquois herself was in very serious danger during the storm, and in fact was sunk herself in similar circumstances during a storm in the Gulf Islands on April 10, 1911, with 14 people drowned.)Hacking, Norman R., and Lamb, W. Kaye, The Princess Story ‚Äì A Century and a Half of West Coast Shipping, at 225, Mitchell Press, Vancouver, BC, 1974 Over in Port Townsend, the dispatcher of the Puget Sound Tug Boat Company sent the tugs Sea Lion (from Seattle) and Richard Holyoke (from Port Townsend) to look for Clallam. Richard Holyoke departed Port Townsend at about 7:30 p.m. Location of Clallam would prove difficult, as contrary to law, she carried no distress signal rockets. =Rising water on board= As the gale rose in the Strait, First Officer George W. Doney was in command at the pilot house, while Captain Roberts was resting in his cabin. As the ship's rolling increased, Captain Roberts, realizing the ship was in distress, came to the pilot house. Chief Engineer Scott A. DeLaunay called up the speaking tube to report that a deadlightA porthole with an unremovable iron cover fastened over the glass. Kline and Bayless, at 69, n.4 had been stove in and the ship was taking on water. Captain Roberts sent Doney to find out what was happening. It turned out that the deadlight, which had been previously broken and then repaired, but not apparently very well, had been stove in by the storm waves. Engineer De Launay went to the pilot house and reported in person the situation to Captain Roberts. Roberts went down to the engine room, where he found it was waist deep in water. The engineering staff had tried to plug up the hole using blankets stuffed in and held in place with nailed down boards. These efforts had obviously failed. Just how this appalling situation had come about was never completely cleared up. Either Clallam's pumps were defective, clogged with coal or other debris or were operated incorrectly by chief engineer De Launay. Rather than evacuating water from the vessel, the pumps appear to have moved water into it. Back up pumps also failed. At about 3:00 p.m., the rising water quenched the vessel's boiler fire, leaving her without power.Ebbesmeyer, C.C. & Haglund, W.D. (2002): Floating remains on Pacific Northwest waters. ‚Äì In: Haglund, W.D. & Sorg, M.H. (eds): Advances in forensic taphonomy method, theory and archeological perspectives pp.: 219-240, Boca Raton, CRC Press. Lowering the boats At about 3:30 p.m., when the ship seemed as if it could not long stay afloat, Captain Roberts ordered the lifeboats lowered, and into them placed mostly women and children, but apparently no officers from the ship to command the boats, although four crewman and a passenger who was an experienced merchant officer went in the first boat. All three boats capsized or failed to properly launch, drowning all aboard them. Many of the men remaining on board watched their wives and children drown. One man was on his wedding trip. His bride drowned. Newell describes the scene: Other accounts state that the second boat capsized about from the steamer. Clallam remains afloat Those remaining on board began bailing out the ship with buckets, and she stayed afloat until the next morning, Saturday, January 9. Meanwhile, at about 10:35 p.m. on January 8, the steam tug Richard Holyoke, under the command of Capt. Robert Hall, found her. Captain Hall got a tow line on board and took Clallam under tow. This was in between Smith Island and San Juan Island. Although Victoria was closer, the weather conditions were such that it seemed best to head for the American shore. The tug Sea Lion joined them at about 1:00 a.m. on January 9. Capsize and sinking Clallam never got to the shore. Captain Roberts realized she was about to founder and signaled the Holyoke to cast off the towline. Holyoke misunderstood Captain Roberts' signal to cast off the tow line, so it had to be cut lest the sinking Clallam drag Holyoke down with her. Clallam rolled over and sank quickly at about 1:15 a.m. The tugs then went to rescue the people in the water, saving most or all of the 36 who had remained aboard.Newell, Gordon R., and Williamson, Joe, Pacific Steamboats, at 84-85, Bonanza Books, New York, NY 1958 Capt. Edward D. Hickman (1876‚Äì1928), then serving as mate on Richard Holyoke, dove into the icy water to rescue 15 people. He suffered from poor health as a result for a long time afterwards. Aftermath The Tacoma Times subsequently reported that the wreck of the Clallam had been salvaged and sold at auction, with the Canadian Pacific Railway buying \\"the capstan and some of the more movable parts\\"; a pawnbroker bought much of the hull, with the intent of displaying it at exhibitions, but by June 1904 had abandoned it on a beach outside Oak Bay.AS THE CLALLAM LOOKS NOW, in the Tacoma Times (via Chronicling America); published June 9, 1904; retrieved August 9, 2017 Remains of the Clallam, in June 1904 Impact of loss 56 people in the boats had drowned, of whom 45 were passengers. Not one of the seventeen women and four children on the passenger list survived. There were probably more than 56 lost because several children under fare age were never accounted for. Bad as this was, things could have been much worse, as Clallam had embarked only 92 people (31 crew and 61 passengers) on her last voyage, although she was licensed to carry 250 passengers on ordinary voyages with freight, or 500 on excursions without freight. Engineer DeLaunay's license was revoked. Captain Roberts' license was suspended. Noting the absence of legally-required signal rockets on board Clallam, the steamboat inspection service launched a crackdown on defective or insufficiently equipped vessels, of which there were many. The Clallam's route was taken over by the Alaskan Steamship Company, operating first the Dolphin and then later Majestic, which was rebuilt and renamed Whatcom. Joshua Green, then in charge of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, determined to put much more reliable ships on the inland seas, shortly thereafter purchasing the steel steamers Indianapolis, Chippewa, and Iroquois from the Great Lakes and arranging to bring them around South America through the Strait of Magellan to Puget Sound. One other significance of the Clallam disaster may be that when the Princess Sophia went aground in October 1918, in Lynn Canal, her captain, undoubtedly familiar with the Clallam sinking, refused to put the passengers into the boats, even though rescue vessels were at hand, due to the bad sea conditions which it must have seemed to him would make evacuation of the stranded vessel a greater danger than remaining on board. This proved to be a fatal misjudgment in the Princess Sophia's case, as the sea and wind came up during the night, washed the Sophia off the rocks, and drowned all aboard.

The Academy encouraged, supported and enabled teaching excellence in the United Kingdom higher education community. This was achieved through development of research and evaluation both for the higher education (HE) community as a whole and through the discipline-specific expertise of the subject centres. The stated aim of the Academy is: \\"to improve the learning experience for students\\". The Engineering Subject Centre was based in the Faculty of Engineering at Loughborough University. It drew upon the expertise of engineering academics and educationalists from across the higher education sector, and worked closely with the engineering professional bodies. History The centre was originally created as part of the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), founded in January 2000. The Higher Education Academy was founded in May 2004, from a merger of the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILTHE), the LTSN, and the Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund National Co-ordination Team. As a part of the Higher Education Academy, the subject centre was funded by grants from four higher education funding bodies in the UK (Higher Education Funding Council for England, Scottish Funding Council, Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Department for Employment and Learning), subscriptions from higher education institutions, and grant/contract income for organised initiatives.

In 1977, he was found guilty on three charges of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, remaining in prison until his death 35 years later.The story of this man is documented in the show,‚ÄùTwisted:Born to kill- Trevor Hardy‚Äù  Murders  Janet Lesley Stewart, 15, was stabbed to death on New Year's Eve 1974 and buried in a shallow grave in Newton Heath, North Manchester. Wanda Skala, 17, was murdered on 19 July 1975 on Lightbowne Road, Moston while walking home from the hotel where she worked as a barmaid. She had been hit over the head with a brick, robbed and sexually assaulted. Her body was found partially buried on a building site. In March 1976 after walking home from a staff party, Sharon Mosoph, 17, was stabbed and strangled with a pair of tights prior to being dumped in the Rochdale Canal at Failsworth. The bodies of Skala and Mosoph were found stripped and mutilated. At the height of the hunt for the serial killer, 23,000 people were stopped and searched.Drop Dead, Doreen Lawrence: A Speech By Alexander Baron (Text)  Arrest, trial and conviction  Although Hardy was arrested for Skala's murder after bragging about it to his younger brother, he was freed on the basis of an alibi he had arranged with his partner, Sheilagh Farrow, and because he had filed his teeth with a contraband file delivered by his partner so they would not match the bite marks found on her body. He would go on to kill Mosoph six months after being freed. Hardy was arrested for the murders of Skala and Mosoph in August 1976. He confessed to the murders and to that of Stewart, who until then had been a missing person. Prior to Stewart's murder, Hardy had been released on parole for battering a man with a pickaxe. He reportedly mistook Stewart for a schoolgirl with whom he was infatuated. Hardy removed Stewart's ring and gave it to another girl as a \\"love token\\". Hardy had also kept Skala's blood-stained clothes and her handbag as \\"grisly trophies\\". The investigation revealed that Hardy killed Mosoph after she witnessed him attempting to burgle a shopping centre at night. At his trial, Hardy sacked his Queen's Counsel and attempted to confess to manslaughter; however, the plea was rejected and he was found guilty of murder. On 2 May 1978, at the Manchester Crown Court, Hardy was sentenced to three life sentences for the murders with a minimum of 30 years. Hardy served his sentence more than 30 years after his arrest at Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire, where he was reported to have a \\"good work record\\". He maintained his innocence and reportedly sent a letter to Mosoph's relatives blaming his parents. On 23 February 2008, The Times revealed that Hardy was one of up to 50 British prisoners currently in prison who had been issued with a whole life tariff and were unlikely to ever be released. The whole life tariff was reaffirmed in June 2008 by the High Court. Manchester locals had long suspected Hardy in the 1971 murder of 17-year-old Dorothy Leyden, and in 2004 family members requested that the Greater Manchester Police re-examine old evidence. Detectives reviewing the cold case believe forensic evidence exonerates Hardy in the murder of Leyden, as DNA samples examined more than 30 years after the crime were found not to match Hardy.  Death  Hardy collapsed in his cell at Wakefield Prison on 23 September 2012 after suffering a heart attack. He died in the hospital two days later, aged 67.

All 50 states in the U.S. mandate immunizations for children in order to enroll in public school, but various exemptions are available depending on the state. All states have exemptions for people who have medical contraindications to vaccines, and all states except for California, Maine, Mississippi, New York, and West Virginia allow religious exemptions, while sixteen states allow parents to cite personal, conscientious, philosophical, or other objections. An increasing number of parents are using religious and philosophical exemptions: researchers have cited this increased use of exemptions as contributing to loss of herd immunity within these communities, and hence an increasing number of disease outbreaks. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion, unless the child is put at significant risk of harm (e.g., during an epidemic, or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound). Under such circumstances, the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of medical neglect and should be reported to state child protective services agencies. See Vaccination schedule for the vaccination schedule used in the United States. Immunizations are often compulsory for military enlistment in the U.S. All vaccines recommended by the U.S. government for its citizens are required for green card applicants. This requirement stirred controversy when it was applied to the HPV vaccine in July 2008 because of the cost of the vaccine, and because the other thirteen required vaccines prevent diseases which are spread by a respiratory route and are considered highly contagious, while HPV is only spread through sexual contact. In November 2009, this requirement was canceled. =Schools= The United States has a long history of school vaccination requirements. The first school vaccination requirement was enacted in the 1850s in Massachusetts to prevent the spread of smallpox. The school vaccination requirement was put in place after the compulsory school attendance law caused a rapid increase in the number of children in public schools, increasing the risk of smallpox outbreaks. The early movement towards school vaccination laws began at the local level including counties, cities, and boards of education. By 1827, Boston had become the first city to mandate that all children entering public schools show proof of vaccination. In addition, in 1855 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had established its own statewide vaccination requirements for all students entering school; this influenced other states to implement similar statewide vaccination laws in schools as seen in New York in 1862, Connecticut in 1872, Pennsylvania in 1895, and later the Midwest, South and Western US. By 1963, 20 states had school vaccination laws. These school vaccination resulted in political debates throughout the United States, as those opposed to vaccination sought to overturn local policies and state laws. An example of this political controversy occurred in 1893 in Chicago, where less than 10 percent of the children were vaccinated despite the twelve-year- old state law. Resistance was seen at the local level of the school district as some local school boards and superintendents opposed the state vaccination laws, leading the state board health inspectors to examine vaccination policies in schools. Resistance proceeded during the mid-1900s and in 1977 a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative was developed with the goal of increasing vaccination rates among children to 90% by 1979. During the two- year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines. In 1922 the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case Zucht v. King. The court decided that a school could deny admission to children who failed to provide a certification of vaccination for the protection of the public health. In 1987, a measles epidemic occurred in Maricopa County, Arizona, and another court case, Maricopa County Health Department vs. Harmon, examined the arguments of an individual's right to education over the state's need to protect against the spread of disease. The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles has passed. Schools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Opt-out criteria are determined at a state level. In the United States, opt-outs take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2019, 46 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership. Only Mississippi, West Virginia, California and New York do not permit religious exemptions. 18 states allow personal or philosophical opposition to vaccination. Over the last decade vaccination rates have been declining in the United States. Although the rate is fairly limited on a larger scale, vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks are occurring in pockets across the U.S. ‚ÄúIn 2012, exemption rates ranged from a low of approximately 0.45 percent in New Mexico, to a high of 6.5 percent in Oregon. The outbreaks have significant correlations with unvaccinated children, and state policy exemption processes. California, which is currently in the process of changing its state exemption policies, dealt with a 2015 measles outbreak stemming from the popular Disneyland park. Significantly, most of the afflicted were unvaccinated, which eventually spread to over 17 separate states across the U.S. If the federal government works to provide an equal vaccination regulation nationally, immunization rates should begin to rise, while preventable outbreaks should diminish. Old age In 1790, people over the age of 65 were less than 2% of the American population. In 2017, they were about 14%.

Life Born at the Barony of Islands, County Clare, Ireland, √ì h√çceadha was a member of a bardic family. He was educated locally and later entered the College of St Antony at Louvain, which had just been founded for Irish Roman Catholic students, and received the Franciscan habit on 1 November 1607. Among his teachers there were Hugh Mac an Bhaird and Hugh Mac Caghwell (the latter was later named Archbishop of Armagh). After his ordination to the priesthood, Hickey was appointed lecturer in theology at Leuven, and subsequently professor in the college of St Francis at Cologne. In 1619 he was summoned to Rome to collaborate with Father Luke Wadding in preparing the Annals of the Franciscan Order for publication, and the works of Duns Scotus. He took an active part in the labours of the commissions appointed by Pope Urban VIII to revise the Roman Breviary, and to examine into the affairs of the Eastern Church. At the general chapter of the order held in Rome in 1639, he was elected definitor general. He lived for some time at San Pietro in Montorio on the Janiculum. From 1624 until his death, he resided in Rome at the College of Saint Isidore. Works During the discussions which were held in Rome concerning the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, Hickey won distinction by his learning and acuteness.

History  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1959. Between 1955 and 1963, the United States provided $409.6 million in economic grant aid and $83.7 million in military assistance. This aid was used primarily to repair damage caused by the Indochina War, to support internal security forces, and for the construction of an all-weather road to the seaport of Sihanoukville, which gave Cambodia its first direct access to the sea and access to the southwestern hinterlands. Relations deteriorated in the early 1960s. Diplomatic relations were broken by Cambodia in May 1965, but were reestablished on July 2, 1969. U.S. relations continued after the establishment of the Khmer Republic until the U.S. mission was evacuated on April 12, 1975. During the 1970‚Äì75 war, the United States provided $1.18 billion in military assistance to government forces in their fight against the Khmer Rouge as well as $503 million in economic assistance. The United States condemned the brutal character of the Khmer Rouge regime between 1975 and 1979. However, the fact that this regime was toppled in the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War by Vietnam, which the United States regarded as a hostile power, led to US condemnation of the Vietnamese invasion. The United States recognized the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (which included the Khmer Rouge) as the legitimate government of Cambodia. Ben Kiernan claimed that the US offered material support to the Khmer Rouge after the Vietnamese invasion. Other sources have disputed these claims, and described extensive fighting between the US-backed forces of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and the Khmer Rouge. Concurrent with these efforts, the United States supported ASEAN's efforts in the 1980s to achieve a political settlement of the Cambodian problem that would include the Khmer Rouge in the government. This was accomplished on October 23, 1991, when the Paris Conference reconvened to sign a comprehensive settlement. The U.S. Mission in Phnom Penh opened on May 13, 1994, headed by career diplomat Charles H. Twining, Jr., who was designated U.S. Special Representative to the SNC. On January 3, 1992, the U.S. lifted its embargo against Cambodia, thus normalizing economic relations with the country. The United States also ended blanket opposition to lending to Cambodia by international financial institutions. When the freely elected Royal Government of Cambodia was formed on September 24, 1993, the United States and the Kingdom of Cambodia immediately established full diplomatic relations. The U.S. Mission was upgraded to a U.S. embassy, and in May 1994 Mr. Twining became the U.S. ambassador. After the factional fighting in 1997 and Hun Sen's legal machinations to depose First Prime Minister Ranariddh, the United States suspended bilateral assistance to the Cambodian Government. At the same time, many U.S. citizens and other expatriates were evacuated from Cambodia and, in the subsequent weeks and months, more than 40,000 Cambodian refugees fled to Thailand. The 1997 events also left a long list of uninvestigated human rights abuses, including dozens of extrajudicial killings. Since 1997 until recently, U.S. assistance to the Cambodian people has been provided mainly through non- governmental organizations, which flourish in Cambodia.

The Embassy's Self- help and Democracy and Human Rights Funds are some of the largest in Africa. Through several State Department and USAID regional funds, the Embassy also provides funds for refugees, HIV/AIDS, democratization and girl's scholarships. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provided a commodity grant valued at $6 million in 2003 to fund agricultural development projects in the North and Far North provinces. A similar program for $4 million was approved in 2004. The program will fund an agricultural development and nutrition enhancement project in the East and Adamawa provinces.

Founded as a marketplace that local growers could rent cooperatively to sell their products in a space more suited to their needs than Boston's historic Haymarket open-air marketplace, it has been the focal point of the floral trade of New England for over a hundred years. Although originally a local growers' wholesale market, the Flower Exchange now features flowers and foliage from dozens of countries and has expanded to carry potted plants, glassware, pottery and other floral supplies. The Flower Exchange is not open to the public and is limited to members of the trade only. In December 2016, it was announced that the exchange will be moving to a facility on 2nd Street in Chelsea and changing their name to the New England Flower Exchange. The move will be final by the end of January 2017.  History  The Boston Cooperative Flower Growers Association leased the first space for a wholesale growers' market in 1892 in an empty storefront on Tremont Street, near the current Park Street T Station. Before the end of the year the location was overcrowded and the Board of Directors decided to lease the basement of the Park Street Church in 1894. As the success of the market continued to attract more growers and buyers, the market was forced to move again in 1903, this time to 163 Columbus Avenue. When the stalls in the newly renovated market were auctioned off, the exorbitant prices pushed some of the growers to form another organization, named the Boston Cooperative Market, which opened in the basement of the old Music Hall. The Flower Exchange was founded in 1909 when the two organizations combined in order to find a building that could better meet their collective needs. They moved once more to Winthrop Square before settling on the Cyclorama Building on Tremont Street in 1923, which once housed the famous panoramic painting of the battle Gettysburg. Due to the increasingly haphazard parking situation and plans by the controversial Boston Redevelopment Authority to purchase the Cyclorama building, the original home to the Gettysburg Cyclorama, now the main building of the Boston Center for the Arts, the Board of Directors began looking for a new location in 1963. In 1941 the market became wholesale only with admission by badge at the petition of group of local florists. In 1957 the first product from outside New England, anemones from New York, were admitted for sale on a trial basis. The market was opened to all imported products in 1965 after the Board of Directors approved a petition by one of the wholesalers. Commissioned salesmen were first approved in 1958, allowing salesmen and wholesale companies to sell the product instead of than the growers themselves to attend their booths. During the first half of the 20th century the New England region rose to prominence as a cut flower producer, cultivating many varieties of hybrid roses and carnations in greenhouses. The New England Carnation Growers Association had as many as 125 members but rising oil prices forced many out of business and the association was abandoned in 1980. The Boston Flower Exchange Inc. moved to its location on Albany Street in 1971. As the construction of the new building was on reclaimed land, the process greatly slowed by the discovery of many old wharf pilings, seawalls and sewers. The building has over of refrigerated space. When the market first opened there were more than 40 wholesalers accessible through a single switchboard operator.  Today  As of January 1, 2008 the Flower Exchange housed thirteen independent wholesale companies in imported and domestic cut flowers and foliage, potted plants and floral supplies. The companies are listed on the Boston Flower Exchange website. The scale and variety of product at the Flower Exchange has changed since the 1960s as the flower industry was one of the first to feel the effects of globalization. Now products are shipped via air and/ or refrigerated truck from nearly every continent.  Scholarship  Rachel Butterworth Deitz, a shareholder in the Boston Flower Exchange, endowed her stock to form a scholarship to give to students interested in the study and pursuit of floriculture. This is awarded annually at the stockholder's meeting.

History  The relationship is cordial and has strong historical roots. In the early 18th century, U.S. whaling ships appear to have begun recruiting crews from Brava and Fogo to hunt whales that were abundant in the waters surrounding Cape Verde. Ties between the American colonies and Cape Verde are documented as early as the 1740s, when American ships routinely anchored in Cape Verdean ports to trade for salt or buy slaves. The tradition of emigration to the United States began at that time and continues today. The first U.S. consulate in sub-Saharan Africa was established in Cape Verde in 1818. U.S. consular representation continued throughout the 19th century. The United States recognised Cape Verde on its independence day and supported its admission to the United Nations. Cape Verde assigned one of its first ambassadors to the United States, and a resident U.S. ambassador was posted to Cape Verde in 1983. Prime Minister Jose Neves visited Cape Verdean communities in New England during an official trip to the United States in 2002, and President Pedro Pires visited the United States in April 2005. (Prime Minister Neves also visited the U.S. in September 2007.) The United States provided emergency humanitarian aid and economic assistance to Cape Verde in the period immediately following Cape Verde's independence, as well as after natural disasters, including a hurricane that struck the island of Brava in 1982, and after a severe volcanic eruption on Fogo in 1995. Cape Verde also is eligible for trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and has signed an Open Skies agreement to facilitate air travel safety and expansion. On July 4, 2005, Cape Verde became the third country to sign a compact with the U.S. Government-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC); the five-year assistance package is worth over $110 million in addressing rural economic expansion, infrastructure development, and development of the credit sector.

Overview Although the United Kingdom is responsible for the Cayman Islands' defence and external affairs, important bilateral issues are often resolved by negotiations between the Cayman Government and foreign governments, including the United States. Despite close historic and political links to the U.K. and Jamaica, geography and the rise of tourism and international finance in the Cayman Islands' economy has made the United States its most important foreign economic partner. Following a decline in tourists from the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks, over 200,000 U.S. citizens travelled by air to the Cayman Islands in 2004; 4,761 Americans were resident there as of 2005. For U.S. and other foreign investors and businesses, the Cayman Islands' main appeal as a financial centre is the absence of all major direct taxes, free capital movement, minimal government regulations, and a well-developed financial infrastructure. With the rise in international narcotics trafficking, the Cayman Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty of 1986 with the United States in order to reduce the use of its facilities for money laundering operations. In June 2000, the Cayman Islands was listed by multilateral organisations as a tax haven and a non-cooperative territory in fighting money laundering. The country's swift response in enacting laws limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and for banks to cooperate with foreign investigators led to its removal from the list of non-cooperative territories in June 2001. U.S. representation The United States does not maintain diplomatic offices in the Cayman Islands. Diplomatic relations are conducted through the U.S. Embassy in London and the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Cayman Islands are, however, part of the consular district administered by the U.S. Embassy in Kingston, Jamaica. There also is a U.S. Consular Agency in George Town on Grand Cayman to assist in providing services for American citizens.

Christian faith In the mid-1970s, Foot became a born-again Christian while staying with the L'Abri Fellowship in Hampshire. His personal faith caused significant inner turmoil for him as he struggled with addiction for much of his life. In his unpublished autobiography, he constantly refers to the 'demons of temptation' and his failure in living a life that reflected his beliefs. Foot was an active member of Grace Community Church in Morval, near Looe in Cornwall where his portrayal of a cockney Doubting Thomas during a number of services is remembered well.

Air Jamaica and Sandals After his departure from Orbis, Foot worked for Air Jamaica and Sandals Resorts as a Vice-President of Public Affairs from 1996-2004. Splitting his time between Jamaica and the UK, Foot used his contacts in the press to significantly raise the profile of Air Jamaica, Sandals and Jamaica at large to the people of the UK. Jamaica Blue During 1998, in partnership with the Jamaican Government, Foot started an upmarket chain of coffee shops called Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee Shops Limited (Jamaica Blue). The flagship location opened in Mayfair, London, in mid- January 1999. Jamaica Blue sold and used Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee and served locally supplied Jamaican foods, cakes and crafts; Air Jamaica transported all the coffee at a discount price and even flew shipments of Jamaica's own St Catherine's peak spring water.

The relations have generally been positive, although concerns over the pace of political and economic liberalization and human rights have affected the degree of support provided by the United States to the Central African Republic.  History  The United States and the Central African Republic established diplomatic relations on August 13th, 1960. The U.S. Embassy in Bangui was briefly closed as a result of the 1996-97 mutinies. It reopened in 1998 with limited staff, but U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Peace Corps missions previously operating in Bangui did not return. The American Embassy in Bangui again temporarily suspended operations on November 2, 2002 in response to security concerns raised by the October 2002 launch of Fran√ßois Boziz√©'s 2003 military coup. The Embassy reopened in January 2005; however, there currently is limited U.S. diplomatic/consular representation in the C.A.R. As a result, the ability of the Embassy to provide services to American citizens remains extremely limited. The Department of State approved the lifting of Section 508 aid restrictions triggered by the coup; U.S. assistance to the Central African Republic had been prohibited except in the areas of humanitarian aid and support for democratization.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 81% of Chadians approve of U.S. leadership, with 18% disapproving and 1% uncertain, the fourth-highest rating for any surveyed country in Africa.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup US missions The American embassy in N'Djamena, established at Chadian independence in 1960, was closed from the onset of the heavy fighting in the city in 1980 until the withdrawal of the Libyan forces at the end of 1981. It was reopened in January 1982. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Information Service (USIS) offices resumed activities in Chad in September 1983  History  Chad and the United States established diplomatic relations on August 11th, 1960. During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and Chad had maintained fairly low-level economic ties, including investment guarantees and project aid, such as Peace Corps involvement. Drought in the early 1970s brought United States food and agriculture aid to remote areas, including grain supplies, animal health services, and technical assistance. Other economic agreements included road building in the Lake Chad area and rural community development. Although Chad was part of France's sphere of influence, it also provided a low level of military assistance until 1977. President F√©lix Malloum's 1978 request for increased military aid to fight the FROLINAT insurgency coincided with a marked increase in Soviet activity in Africa, especially in Ethiopia, and increased Soviet arms shipments to Libya. United States relations with African states were redefined in accordance with the new strategic value assigned to African allies, and United States foreign policy shifted accordingly. Thus, in the 1980s United States interest and involvement in Chad increased. Embassy of Chad in Washington, D.C.. =Reagan administration= Chad became a focus of American policy regarding North Africa when Secretary of State Alexander Haig sought new ways to undermine the Muammar Gaddafi regime, which was destabilizing much of the region from its base in neighboring Libya. A plan was developed to attack Libya's southern front through Chad at a time when much of the northern half of Chad was occupied by Libyan troops. The Central intelligence Agency provided arms for the anti-Qaddafi faction led by Hiss√®ne Habr√©. The plan was successful, Qaddafi withdrew his troops. Habr√© seized control of the government of Chad in 1982, and received enthusiastic military and financial support from Washington. However, by 1988 American advisers had begun to stress the need to reconcile warring factions and pacify rebel groups within Chad. United States support to Chad included several economic and military aid agreements, including training programs to improve the effectiveness of Habr√©'s administration and to bolster public confidence in the government and intelligence-sharing to assist in countering Libyan forces in 1987.

It also included projects in road repair and maintenance, maternal and child health, famine early warning systems, and agricultural marketing. A number of American voluntary agencies (notably Africare and VITA) continue to operate in Chad. Peace Corps has traditionally had a large presence in Chad, with volunteers arriving during the postwar period in September 1987, then withdrawing in 1998. Peace Corps operations resumed in September 2003, with a group of 20 new volunteers. The second class of 17 volunteers arrived in September 2004. Both groups focused on teaching English; expansion into other areas was planned for 2005. Currently the Peace Corps presence in Chad is inactive. In April 2007, Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte visited Chad in light of the War in Darfur. Chad is a participant in the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative and cooperates with the United States military in fighting al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (and affiliated) insurgents. =Travel Ban= On September 24, 2017, US President Donald Trump announced a travel ban that restricted the travel of the citizens of Chad to the United States, citing the risk of terrorism. Regional experts including J. Peter Pham of the Atlantic Council, Monde Muyangwa of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and John Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations expressed concern that Chad could reduce its defense and counter-terrorism cooperation with the United States in response. On April 10, 2018, the US Government issued a proclamation lifting the travel restrictions on Chad. Education The American International School of N'Djamena is in the Chadian capital.

It happened on the night of 14‚Äì15 August 1945, just before the announcement of Japan's surrender to the Allies. The coup was attempted by the Staff Office of the Ministry of War of Japan and many from the Imperial Guard to stop the move to surrender. The officers murdered Lieutenant General Takeshi Mori of the First Imperial Guards Division and attempted to counterfeit an order to the effect of occupying the Tokyo Imperial Palace ('). They attempted to place Emperor Hirohito under house arrest, using the 2nd Brigade Imperial Guard Infantry. They failed to persuade the Eastern District Army and the high command of the Imperial Japanese Army to move forward with the action. Due to their failure to convince the remaining army to oust the Imperial House of Japan, they performed ritual suicide. As a result, the communiqu√© of the intent for a Japanese surrender continued as planned.  Background  = Decision to accept the Potsdam Declaration = Hirohito, Emperor of Japan On July 26 (Berlin time), the Potsdam Conference issued a declaration on the terms for the surrender of Japan. When the Potsdam Declaration was received in Japan over shortwave, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Shigenori T≈çg≈ç brought a copy to the Emperor of Japan, Hirohito. After going over the declaration point by point, the emperor asked T≈çg≈ç if those terms \\"were the most reasonable to be expected in the circumstances\\". T≈çg≈ç said that they were. The emperor said, \\"I agree. In principle they are acceptable.\\" In late July, however, the other ministers were not ready to accept the declaration.Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts (1977), Enola Gay, 1978 reprint, New York: Pocket Books, \\"Acceleration\\", Section 17, pp. 230-231, . On August 9, 1945, the Japanese government, responding to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the declaration of war by the Soviet Union and to the effective loss of the Pacific and Asian-mainland territories, decided to accept the Potsdam Declaration. On the same day the Supreme Council for the Direction of War opened before the Japanese Imperial court. In the Council the Prime Minister Kantar≈ç Suzuki, the Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Shigenori T≈çg≈ç suggested to Hirohito that the Japanese should accept the Potsdam Declaration and unconditionally surrender. After the closure of the air-raid shelter session, Suzuki mustered the Supreme Council for the Direction of War again, now as an Imperial Conference, which Emperor Hirohito attended. From midnight of August 10, the conference convened in an underground bomb shelter. Hirohito agreed with the opinion of T≈çg≈ç, resulting in the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. Subsequently, the Japanese envoy to Switzerland and Sweden communicated the decision to the Allies. = Agitation in the Army = General Korechika Anami, Minister of War The War Ministry knew the decision of the conference and stirred up a fierce reaction from many officers who intended continued resistance. At 9 o'clock, in the session held at the Ministry of War, the staff officers complained to the Minister Korechika Anami, and not all of them heeded Anami's explanations. After midnight on 12 August a San Francisco radio station (KGEI) relayed the reply from the Allies, and there was a suggestion that the Allies had decided, against the requisition for the protection of the Kokutai from the Imperial Japanese government, that the authority of the sovereignty of the Japanese government and the Emperor would be subordinated to the headquarters of the Allies, a military occupational system that was also applied to the fallen German Reich. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs interpreted this sentence as restricting sovereignty, but the Japanese Army interpreted it more as enslavement. From 3 o'clock the attendees of the imperial families council basically agreed to the surrender of Japan, yet the cabinet council which was supposed to be held at the same time did not concur. Also, the Supreme Council for the Direction of War tangled with the problem of protection for the Kokutai. After these proceedings, some Army officers decided that a coup d'√©tat was needed for protection of the Kokutai. At this time, the core group of these officers had already prepared some troops in Tokyo (, heiryoku shiy≈ç keikaku, literally ‚Äúmilitary force usage plan‚Äù). Late on the night of August 12, 1945, Major Kenji Hatanaka, along with Lieutenant Colonels Masataka Ida, Masahiko Takeshita (Anami's brother-in-law), and Inaba Masao, and Colonel Okikatsu Arao, the Chief of the Military Affairs Section, spoke to War Minister Korechika Anami (the army minister and \\"most powerful figure in Japan besides the Emperor himself\\"), and asked him to do whatever he could to prevent acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. General Anami refused to say whether he would help the young officers in treason. As much as they needed his support, Hatanaka and the other rebels decided they had no choice but to continue planning and to attempt a coup d'√©tat on their own. Hatanaka spent much of August 13 and the morning of August 14 gathering allies, seeking support from the higher-ups in the Ministry, and refining his plot. Shortly after the Imperial Conference on the night of August 13‚Äì14 at which the surrender finally was decided, Anami had two conversations in which he expressed opposition to the surrender. He asked Yoshijir≈ç Umezu if \\"the war should be continued even at the risk of launching a coup d'√©tat\\", to which Umezu concluded, \\"There is nothing we can do now but to comply with the Emperor's decision.\\" Anami then confronted a Colonel Saburo Hayashi in a washroom and asked about \\"the possibility of attacking a large American convoy rumored to be outside of Tokyo.\\" Hayashi dashed Anami's suggestion by reaffirming the Imperial decision while noting the presence of the convoy was only a rumor. Finally, his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Masahiko Takeshita confronted Anami, first suggesting Anami resign, which would topple the government; then suggesting he support the coup. To the first, Anami noted that the fall of the government would not stop the Imperial edict, while to the second, he replied that he wished to go to the Army Ministry first. General Torashir≈ç Kawabe, Deputy Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff At the Army Ministry, Anami announced compliance with the Imperial edict. Then a group of senior army officers including Anami gathered in a nearby room. All those present were concerned about the possibility of a coup d'√©tat to prevent the surrender‚Äîsome of those present may have even been considering launching one. After a silence, General Torashir≈ç Kawabe, Deputy Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, proposed that all senior officers present sign an agreement to carry out the emperor's order of surrender‚Äî\\"The Army will act in accordance with the Imperial Decision to the last.\\" It was signed by all the high-ranking officers present, including Anami, Hajime Sugiyama, Yoshijir≈ç Umezu, Kenji Doihara, Torashir≈ç Kawabe, Masakazu Kawabe, and Tadaichi Wakamatsu. \\"This written accord by the most senior officers in the Army, in addition to Anami's announcement, acted as a formidable firebreak against any attempt to incite a coup d'√©tat in Tokyo.\\"  Coup attempt  Around 21:30 on August 14, Hatanaka's rebels set their plan into motion. The Second Regiment of the First Imperial Guards had entered the palace grounds, doubling the strength of the battalion already stationed there, presumably to provide extra protection against Hatanaka's rebellion. But Hatanaka, along with Lt. Col. Jir≈ç Shiizaki, convinced the commander of the Second Regiment, Colonel Toyojir≈ç Haga, of their cause, by telling him (untruthfully) that Anami, Umezu, and the commanders of the Eastern District Army and Imperial Guards Divisions were all in on the plan. Hatanaka also went to the office of General Shizuichi Tanaka, commander of the Eastern region of the army, to try to persuade him to join the coup. Tanaka refused, and ordered Hatanaka to go home. Hatanaka ignored the order. Originally, Hatanaka hoped that simply occupying the palace and showing the beginnings of a rebellion would inspire the rest of the Army to rise up against the move to surrender. This notion guided him through much of the last days and hours and gave him the blind optimism to move ahead with the plan, despite having little support from his superiors. Having set all the pieces into position, Hatanaka and his co-conspirators decided that the Guard would take over the palace at 02:00. The hours until then were spent in continued attempts to convince their superiors in the Army to join the coup. At about the same time, General Anami killed himself, leaving a message that read, \\"I‚Äîwith my death‚Äîhumbly apologize to the Emperor for the great crime.\\" Whether the crime involved losing the war, or the coup, remains unclear. General Takeshi Mori At some time after 01:00, Hatanaka and his men surrounded the palace. Hatanaka, Shiizaki and Captain Shigetar≈ç Uehara (of the Air Force Academy) went to the office of Lt. General Takeshi Mori to ask him to join the coup. Mori was in a meeting with his brother-in-law, Michinori Shiraishi. The cooperation of Mori, as commander of the 1st Imperial Guards Division, was crucial. When Mori refused to side with Hatanaka, Hatanaka murdered him, fearing Mori would order the Guards to stop the rebellion. Uehara killed Shiraishi. These were the only two murders of the night. Hatanaka then used General Mori's official stamp to authorize Imperial Guards Division Strategic Order No. 584, a false set of orders created by his co-conspirators, which would greatly increase the strength of the forces occupying the Imperial Palace and Imperial Household Ministry, and \\"protecting\\" the emperor. The palace police were disarmed and all the entrances blocked. Over the course of the night, Hatanaka's rebels captured and detained eighteen people, including Ministry staff and NHK workers sent to record the surrender speech. K≈çichi Kido, Lord of the Privy Seal, was hiding with the recordings. The rebels, led by Hatanaka, spent the next several hours fruitlessly searching for Imperial Household Minister S≈çtar≈ç Ishiwata, Lord of the Privy Seal K≈çichi Kido, and the recordings of the surrender speech. The two men were hiding in the \\"bank vault\\", a large chamber underneath the Imperial Palace. The search was made more difficult by a blackout in response to Allied bombings, and by the archaic organization and layout of the Imperial House Ministry. Many of the names of the rooms were unrecognizable to the rebels. The rebels did find the chamberlain Yoshihiro Tokugawa. Although Hatanaka threatened to disembowel him with a samurai sword, Tokugawa lied and told them he did not know where the recordings or men were. During their search, the rebels cut nearly all of the telephone wires, severing communications between their prisoners on the palace grounds and the outside world. At about the same time, in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, another group of Hatanaka's rebels led by Captain Takeo Sasaki went to Prime Minister Suzuki's office, intent on killing him. When they found it empty, they machine-gunned the office and set the building on fire, then left for his home. Hisatsune Sakomizu had warned Suzuki, and he escaped minutes before the would-be assassins arrived. After setting fire to Suzuki's home, they went to the estate of Kiichir≈ç Hiranuma to assassinate him. Hiranuma escaped through a side gate and the rebels burned his house as well. Suzuki spent the rest of August under police protection, spending each night in a different bed. Around 03:00, Hatanaka was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army was on its way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan what he was trying to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the Second Regiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds. Just before 05:00, as his rebels continued their search, Major Hatanaka went to NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, tried desperately to get some airtime to explain his actions. A little over an hour later, after receiving a telephone call from the Eastern District Army, Hatanaka finally gave up. He gathered his officers and walked out of the NHK studio. The coup collapsed after Shizuichi Tanaka convinced the rebellious officers to go home. Tanaka killed himself nine days later. At dawn, Tanaka learned that the palace had been invaded. He went there and confronted the rebellious officers, berating them for acting contrary to the spirit of the Japanese army. He convinced them to return to their barracks. By 08:00, the rebellion was entirely dismantled, having succeeded in holding the palace grounds for much of the night but failing to find the recordings. Hatanaka, on a motorcycle, and Shiizaki, on horseback, rode through the streets, tossing leaflets that explained their motives and their actions. Within an hour before the emperor's broadcast, sometime around 11:00, August 15, Hatanaka placed his pistol to his forehead, and shot himself. Shiizaki stabbed himself with a dagger, and then shot himself. In Hatanaka's pocket was found his death poem: \\"I have nothing to regret now that the dark clouds have disappeared from the reign of the Emperor.\\"  See also  * Jewel Voice Broadcast * Matsue incident * Films depicting the incident: ** Japan's Longest Day ** The Emperor in August ** Emperor (film)  References  Citations Bibliography    * Further reading Thomas, Gordon and Witts, Max Morgan (1977), Enola Gay, 1978 reprint, New York: Pocket Books, .

Chile‚ÄìUnited States relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Chile and the United States of America. Relations, which can be traced to the nineteenth century, have improved in the period 1988 to the present to be better than any other time in history. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the United States government applauded the rebirth of democratic practices in Chile, despite having allowed and recognized the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat and aided the subsequent military regime. Regarded as one of the least corrupt and most vibrant democracies in South America, with a healthy economy, Chile is noted as being one of the closest strategic allies of the United States in the Southern Hemisphere, along with Colombia, and remains part of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. A prime example of cooperation includes the landmark 2003 Chile‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement. Chile is also the only South American nation that shares membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with the United States, as well as the only Latin American country to be included in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. The governments consult frequently on issues including multilateral diplomacy, security, culture and science. Recently the governments have signed agreements on education and green energy. According to several global opinion polls, Chileans have a considerably positive opinion of the U.S., with 72% of Chileans viewing the U.S. favorably in 2015,Pew Global Indicators Databse: Chile. and 62% of Chileans viewing American influence positively in 2013, the highest rating for any surveyed country in Latin America.2013 World Service Poll BBC According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 42% of Chileans approve of U.S. leadership, with 25% disapproving and 32% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup U.S. Embassy In addition to working closely with Chilean government officials to strengthen their bilateral relationship, the U.S. Embassy in Santiago provides a range of services to U.S. citizens and businesses in Chile. (Please see the embassy's home page for details of these services.) The embassy also is the locus for a number of American community activities in the Santiago area. The public affairs section cooperates with universities and non-governmental organizations on programs, including U.S. Speaker, International Visitor, and Fulbright programs. Themes of include trade, international security, democratic governance in the region, judicial reform, law enforcement, environmental issues, and the teaching of English. The public affairs section works daily with Chilean media. It also assists visiting foreign media, including U.S. journalists, and is regularly involved in press events for high-level visitors. Attach√©s at the embassy from the Foreign Commercial Service, Foreign Agricultural Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service work closely with the hundreds of U.S. companies who export to or maintain offices in Chile. These officers provide information on Chilean trade and industry regulations and administer several programs intended to support U.S. companies in Chile. The Consular Section of the Embassy provides services to U.S. citizens residing in Chile, currently of 19,000 people. It assists Americans voting in U.S. elections while abroad, provides U.S. tax information, and facilitates government benefit and social security payments. About 170,000 U.S. citizens visit Chile each year. The Consular Section offers passport and emergency services to U.S. tourists during their stay in Chile. It also issues about 40,000 visitor visas a year to Chilean citizens who travel to the United States. Visa Waiver Program In February 2014, the U.S. government officially announced that it had added Chile to the Visa Waiver Program, enabling all Chilean citizens to travel the United States without payment of a fee beginning in May and making Chile the only nation in Latin America to currently possess such a privilege, one usually afforded to only the closest allies and partners of the U.S., such as countries of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

The Library first started functioning with the manpower, resources and materials inherited from the Provincial Book Deposit Branch. In fact, that book deposit branch was the embryo of the National Library of Bangladesh which came into being after the independence of the country in 1973.

Bug Too! was originally released for the Sega Saturn on November 30, 1996 in North America.PROJECT: Bug Too! It was then ported to Windows on December 10, 1996. Story The background plot involves popular action film stars Bug, Maggot Dog, and Super Fly being signed for a six-picture deal, with all six movies being filmed in a single day. Gameplay The players can play as Bug, Maggot Dog, or Super Fly. Bug Too! is played like a traditional side-scrolling platform game. The player character must make his way through all the levels in each zone, with a boss level at the end of each zone. Bug Too! has 3D levels, which take the side-view and tweak it. Bug can walk sideways up vertical surfaces and even upside down. Unlike the original Bug!, Bug Too has a run button. The two-player mode allows players to alternate playing the game and compete for high scores. When the player finishes a stage with at least 100 crystals collected, they are sent to one of several bonus stages. If the player collects a bonus stage's requisite number of Oscars, they earn an extra life. Reception Bug Too! was met with mixed reviews. Critics were generally pleased with the series additions of the run ability and new characters, though some noted that there is little gameplay difference between them and Bug. However, while the graphics in general were praised, critics found the fixed side-view camera created frustrating problems with the gameplay, such as walls obstructing the player's view of Bug and difficulty judging distances when moving between the foreground and background. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly deemed it an overall fun title, though not a must-have. GamePros Major Mike concluded, \\"Bug Too! meets the expectations of its predecessor and at times exceeds them. Fans of the first game will definitely want to check it out, and for all you newcomers, it's a great time to get bugged.\\" Lee Nutter of Sega Saturn Magazine similarly stated, \\"In all, Bug Too! is a top quality platform game surpassing its predecessors in all areas. But to be honest it really is just more of the same which is great if you liked the original. However, those who didn't won't find anything new to tempt them into purchasing it.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation regarded this lack of genuine innovation over the first game to be a particularly strong strike against it, and compared the game unfavorably to contemporary Saturn platformers Nights into Dreams and Sonic 3D Blast. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot also compared it unfavorably to Sonic 3D Blast, and remarked, \\"The choice of films is far hipper than Spot Goes To Hollywood, but the game doesn't play much better.\\" References External links Gamespot Review *E3 1995 promo *Realtime Associates Official Info Page *Bug Too! at MobyGames *Defunct Games review 1996 video games 3D platform games Realtime Associates games Sega video games Sega Saturn games Video game sequels Video games developed in the United States Windows games Multiplayer and single-player video games Video games with pre-rendered 3D graphics ","title":"Bug Too!"},{"id":"15982564","text":"The National Library of Benin () is the legal deposit library for Benin.

The Republic of the Congo was recognized by the United States on the day of its independence, 15 August 1960. Diplomatic relations between the United States and Congo were broken during the most radical Congolese-Marxist period, 1965‚Äì77. The U.S. Embassy reopened in 1977 with the restoration of relations, which remained distant until the end of the socialist era. The late 1980s were marked by a progressive warming of Congolese relations with Western countries, including the United States. Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso made a state visit to Washington in 1990, where he was received by President George H. W. Bush. History President John F. Kennedy welcoming President Fulbert Youlou to the U.S. shortly after the Congo's independence, June, 1961. The U.S. recognized Congo's independence in 1960 and Congo's first president, Fulbert Youlou, was invited to the U.S. on an official state visit in 1961. Emmanuel Damongo-Dadet served as the first Congolese Ambassador to the United States during the early 1960s. Relations soured following the coup of August 15, 1963 that brought Alphonse Massamba-D√©bat's Soviet backed regime to power. With the advent of democracy in 1991, Congo's relations with the United States improved and were cooperative. The United States has supported Congolese democratization efforts, contributing aid to the country's electoral process. The Congolese Government demonstrated an active interest in deepening and broadening its relations with the United States. Transition Prime Minister Andre Milongo made an official visit to Washington in 1992, where President Bush received him at the White House. Secretary Kerry greets President Sassou Nguesso 2014 Then-presidential candidate Pascal Lissouba travelled to Washington in 1992, meeting with officials, including Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman J.

After his election in August 1992, President Lissouba expressed interest in expanding U.S.-Congo links, seeking increased U.S. development aid, university exchanges, and greater U.S. investment in Congo. With the outbreak of the 1996 war, the U.S. Embassy was evacuated. The embassy was closed, and its personnel became resident in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2001, embassy-suspended operations were lifted, and embassy personnel were allowed to travel to Brazzaville for periods of extended temporary duty from the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa. As a result, U.S.-Congo bilateral relations were reinvigorated. In 2003 and 2004, this practice continued, and a site for construction of a new embassy was acquired in July 2004. Diplomatic activities, operations, and programs were carried out in a temporary bank location until January 2009, when a new, fully functioning embassy was opened.

It is located in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad and was founded in 1920. It has often been affected by losses resulting from warfare.  History  The origins of the National Library lie in the foundation of the Baghdad Peace Library, the Maktabat al-Salam, sometimes called the General Library, which was established in Baghdad in 1920, on the initiative of Muriel Jesse Forbes, with the assistance of Gertrude Bell, then Oriental Secretary to the British High Commissioner. Initially it was a private, subscription library, supported by donated money and books. A Catholic priest and school teacher in a monastery in Baghdad, Anastas Al-Karmali (1866‚Äì1947) became the first librarian of the Al Salam library. Bell devoted some of her time and energy to the management committee and to fund-raising for the Library, but it struggled financially and in 1923 discussions about transferring it to the government commenced. The Library was taken over by or given to the Ministry of Education in 1924 and, in 1929, its collection of 4,283 books was shifted to the al-Mamooria school where it was renamed as al-Maktabat al-Aammat or the Public Library. In the early 1950s, the Baghdad Public Library was situated on Imam al-Adham Street at the north-west corner of the present day Bab al-Mu‚Äôazzam Square, where the North Gate of the old walled city used to stand. By that time, it was being referred to informally as the \\"National Library\\". Some discussions between the Iraqi authorities and the British Embassy about a possible exchange of land as a site for a National Library, and with the British Council about the design of the building, were terminated by the 1958 Revolution. Subsequently the new government designated the former Baghdad Public Library as the National Library by a Law (No. 51) passed in 1961. Although archival collections had accumulated over the centuries, there appears to have been no organisation responsible for them in recent times until action was taken by the University of Baghdad, following a study carried out by an ad hoc committee in 1963. Legislation was passed in 1963 and the National Documents Centre was established by the University in 1964 to collect and conserve official documents. Responsibility for the Centre remained with the University until 1969, when further legislation established the status, aims and objectives of the renamed National Record Office, which became the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture and Information. By the early 1970s, the National Library building was overcrowded, but it was 1977 before it finally moved into a new purpose-built building. However, the original intentions were frustrated when the government allocated a complete floor to the National Record Office or, as it came to be called, the National Centre for Archives. The National Library and the National Centre for Archives were formally amalgamated in 1987. As Saddam Hussein came into power in 1979, the INLA began to weaken. One of the causes came from Hussein directing the country's money towards the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1989). \\"Political appointees and Ba'ath loyalists directed the INLA under Saddam Hussein, and a budget freeze in 1980 ended all new material acquisitions for the remaining years of Saddam's regime\\". Through the next two decades, many of the notable institutions of Iraq, including INLA, continued to falter, especially in the wake of the 2003 Iraq war. = Iraq War = The library building after the fire of 2003. \\"In April of 2003, the National Library and Archives (Dar al-Kutub wa al-Watha‚ÄôIq), which was located directly across from the Ministry of Defense, had been burned and looted\\". The burning and looting appeared to have taken place on two occasions: April 10 and April 12‚Äì13. These fires were set professionally with accelerants. A report was later given by Saad Eskander, the director‚Äìgeneral of the National Library and Archive, regarding the destruction. He noted that three days before the invasion, library staff were told to destroy all archival material related to the Ba'athist rule. Eskander also reported that the destruction was performed by ‚Äúa mix of poor people looking for a quick profit, along with regime loyalists intent on destroying evidence of atrocities‚Äù. The United States Army as the occupying power had a responsibility for the burning, theft and destruction of Iraq cultural legacy including the National Library and Archive. The Hague regulations (Article 2, Fourth Geneva Convention, 1949) state that as an occupying force the USA should have taken measure to ensure that \\"cultural property must be respected\\". American archeologists and academics even warned the US military of the location and importance of protecting Iraq's museums and libraries. However, during the occupation of Baghdad the American military forces placed hundreds of troops at 2 main locations in Baghdad‚ÄîThe Ministry of Interior and The Ministry of Oil; neglecting Iraqs museums, libraries and other institutions. Independent journalist Robert Fisk alerted American troops of the looting and burning of the libraries in Baghdad but they never intervened during the crucial time period required to protect these institutions. It was noted that US troops were positioned right across the road from the library in the Ministry of Defense but orders were withheld to intervene with troops replying \\"we are soldiers, not policemen,\\" when requested to help. Due to an iron door having been locked, most of the damage occurred in the main reading room and lobby of the building. \\"After the first round of destruction, staff and volunteers associated with a cleric named \`Abd al-Mun‚Äôim welded the door shut and removed as many books as they could transport to the cleric's al-Haqq Mosque in Sadr (formerly Saddam) City.\\" In total, an estimated 60 percent of its total archival materials, 25 percent of its books, newspapers, rare books, and most of its historical photographs and maps were destroyed. Included in the rare volumes and documents lost was one of the oldest copies of the Quran. Before the destruction, the library and archives were reported to have held 417,000 books, 2,618 periodicals dating from the late Ottoman era to modern times, and a collection of 4,412 rare books and manuscripts. \\"According to Eskander, Saddam loyalists burned the entirety of the Republican Archive, which contained the records of the Ba'athist regime between the years 1958 and 1979. Also completely destroyed were the Ba'athist court proceedings detailing the charges against and trials of party opponents. Records of Iraq's relations with its neighbors, including Iran, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, are missing. Iraq has accused neighbouring countries of stealing sections of its national archives. In addition to these documents, which would have been of great interest to Iraqi citizens as well as to historians, the INLA lost records and documents from the Ottoman reign, the British occupation, the monarchical era, and much more. The destruction or loss of these materials, according to Eskander, did not occur only during the April 2003 attacks\\". In November 2003, the U.S. Library of Congress sent a team to Baghdad that, among other things, also visited the library in its fire damaged state. They entered the building and visited the stacks of the library, which were hidden behind a metal door. = Restoration and philosophy = Saad Eskander, director of the library and archives since 2003 to 2015, has been keeping a diary through the British Library's website, with entries starting in November 2006. His entries document the events covering the library and archive's restoration. By 2007, the center \\"had already become a safe haven for intellectual activity, fully accessible to the public, with a state-of-the-art computer center\\". In addition, there is also a facility for transferring documents to microfilm, a cataloging operation, and a department that locates documents from Iraqi government ministries. Having been a major player in the history of Iraq, the British Library was able to help the reconstruction, by providing microfilm copies of rare books and microfiche copies of documents relating to the administration of Iraq from 1914 to 1921 that were held by the British in India. Despite the fact that five staff members have been killed, along with the library closing for days at a time due to heavy fighting, Eskander says he sees the institution as \\"an important source of uniting and unifying the country.\\" In another interview in 2008, Eskander expanded on this theme. \\"Culture is important, especially secular culture and especially an institution that documents the cultural and scientific achievements of a nation. The country was on the verge of dismemberment and institutions like us and like the Iraqi Museum (National Museum of Iraq) could play a role in the fact that they provide common symbols to all Iraqis. We are not a sectarian institution; we are a national institution.\\" Almost five years later, in 2012, Eskander reflected again on the critical importance of cultural institutions, and stated \\"Primary, intermediate, and high school libraries have not been functioning throughout the course of the war. Policymakers still think that they will win the war against terrorism by the mere use of force, not through spreading humanistic and tolerant cultural values. Our experience proves that progressive culture is vital to the winning of the war against terrorism. Libraries, archives, and museums have a role to play in the formation of true national identity; an identity transcends religious, regional, and ethnic boundaries. A clear-cut and inclusive national identity is what Iraq has been lacking since the British left their mark on the country after World War I. Unfortunately, no importance is attached to the role that the library can play in an emerging young democracy, or in a country where its social fabric is disintegrating rapidly.\\" Yet, in the same article, Eskander mentions that \\"the library is the only national institution that is always willing to assist, unconditionally, other educational or cultural organizations. We have built a good reputation throughout Iraq. We have representatives in every province whose task is to work closely with provincial cultural and educational institutions.\\"  See also  * Destruction of libraries  References   External links  * Official site * Saad Eskander's Iraq diary * Photos of the Iraq National Library 2003‚Äì08 * Rebuilding Iraq's Once-Prized Library by Lourdes Garcia-Navarro * Iraq National Library fire National libraries National archives Libraries in Iraq Government of Iraq World Digital Library partners 1920 establishments in Iraq Libraries established in 1920 Buildings and structures in Baghdad ","title":"Iraq National Library and Archive"},{"id":"15982589","text":"Democratic Republic of the Congo‚ÄìUnited States relations are the international relations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States of America. Overview The dominant position in Central Africa makes stability in the DRC an important element of overall stability in the region. In December 2006, the DRC inaugurated its first democratically elected president in over 40 years, the culmination of the Congolese people's efforts to choose their leaders through a peaceful, democratic process. The United States played a role in the peace process in the DRC. When the DRC was known as Zaire, it had a strong alliance with the United States. This was in part because Zairian leader Mobutu Sese Seko was considered to be a strong anti- communist, and the United States government saw Zaire as a useful stability buffer to prevent the spread of Marxism in Africa. Mobutu himself was friendly with most of the U.S. Presidents during his Presidency, and was also able to get a lot of foreign aid from the U.S. and the west. Zaire also found itself on the same side as the United States and South Africa fighting Cuban and Soviet backed revolutionaries during the Angolan Civil War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 however, relations weakened significantly, and with socialism being less of a threat to western interests in Africa, the United States government saw less of a need to prop up Mobutu's regime, that was also accused of human rights violations. This ultimately lead to Zaire's collapse as Mobutu was not prepared for his regime's fate in the First Congo War. Not long after regime change, Zaire became known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The United States remains a partner with the DRC and other central African nations in their quest for stability and growth on the continent, and facilitated the signing of a tripartite agreement on regional security in the Great Lakes region between the DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda in October 2004. Burundi formally joined the Tripartite Commission in September 2005, and the Tripartite Commission is now Tripartite Plus. The United States also supported UN efforts to create a Joint Verification Mechanism to monitor the border between the DRC and Rwanda. From the start of the Congo crisis, the United States has pursued an active diplomatic strategy in support of these objectives. In the long term, the United States seeks to strengthen the process of internal reconciliation and democratization within all the states of the region to promote stable, developing, and democratic nations with which it can work to address security interests on the continent and develop mutually beneficial economic relations. The United States appointed its current ambassador to the DRC in 2007. The DRC appointed its current ambassador to the United States in 2000.

He considered the storage of 'all printed output in Kazakh and all literature about Kazakhstan' to be the most important task among the library activities. In 1937 the library was named after A.S. Pushkin. In 1991 the library changed its name into the National Library of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the NLRK), and was given special state and public significance as a particularly valuable cultural object of the Republic. The NLRK collections include 5.5 million publications in 100 languages of the world. Researchers are attracted by the collection of rare books and manuscripts. These number about 25 thousand volumes in the Kazak, Russian, Oriental and Western European languages from the eleventh to the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries.  Departments  The library work is defined by its long-term programs: 'Memory of the People,' 'The Preservation and Conservation of Book and Manuscript Monuments,' 'The Republican Automated Library and Information System'. Annually the library acquires more than 36 thousand books, periodicals and machine- read documents. Constant supplements to collections with editions in Kazak is a main trend of the National Library work. The NLRK pays great attention to the development of new links and support of traditional cultural connections with foreign countries. For many years the NLRK has maintained book exchanges with 200 CIS libraries and 80 cultural organizations from 40 countries. In this respect the Library of Congress, the Harvard University Library, countries such as India, Spain, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Norway, Austria, Germany, Iran, Turkey, China, Korea are our permanent partners. The NLRK is a member of the IFLA ‚Äì International Federation of Library Associations. As a result of the transfer of the capital from Almaty to Astana, the NLRK has created a branch based on the S. Seifullin Regional Universal Scientific Library. Within the library is located the headquarters of the Library Association of the Republic of Kazakhstan (LARK), created on the initiative of the NLRK.

As a result, this bus is doing a dead mileage run back to the depot Dead mileage, dead running, light running or dead heading in public transport and empty leg in air charter is when a revenue-gaining vehicle operates without carrying or accepting passengers, such as when coming from a garage to begin its first trip of the day. In this case, the vehicle is said to be deadheading. Similar terms in the UK include empty coaching stock (ECS) move and dead in tow (DIT). The term deadheading also applies to the practice of allowing employees of a common carrier to use a vehicle as a non-revenue passenger. For example, an airline might assign a pilot living in New York to a flight from Denver to Los Angeles, and the pilot would simply catch any flight going to Denver, either wearing their uniform or showing ID, in lieu of buying a ticket. Also, some transport companies will allow employees to use the service when off duty, such as a city bus line allowing an off-duty driver to commute to and from work, free. Additionally, inspectors from a regulatory agency may use transport on a deadhead basis to do inspections such as a Federal Railroad Administration inspector riding a freight train to inspect for safety violations. Causes Dead mileage routinely occurs when a bus route starts or finishes in a location away from a bus garage or out-station, and the start or end of a shift requires driving the bus to and from the garage out of service. Dead mileage can also occur in cases where shift-break parking has to be undertaken in terminals away from the service route. Effects, prevention, and mitigation Dead mileage incurs costs for the operator in terms of non-revenue earning fuel use, wages, and a reduction in the use of the driver's legal hours of driving. Operators will often reduce dead mileage by starting or finishing the first or last service of the day, or shift, at a garage along the route, a so-called part service or part route. Dead mileage may also be reduced by the operation of routes specifically timed and routed to facilitate bus movements rather than passenger need. Often changing routes slightly (and ensuring high on time performance) can greatly increase the useful time to deadhead ratio for both crew and vehicles. Dead mileage has increasingly become an issue with privatised competition for bus services, most notable with the privatisation of London bus services, where competing operators have to factor on the cost of dead mileage when bidding for specific routes away from their main garages. This is exacerbated by not being allowed to operate a service that may match the dead mileage route. This can be lessened to an extent by tendering routes in groups of sufficient size to justify opening/renting new garage space. Often operators will come to an arrangement to share garage facilities to reduce dead mileage. Some air charter companies are leasing out their planes at a lower rate for those empty leg flights to reduce the cost or profit from those originally non-revenue flights.

One such example might be the case of Freebooter William Walker. Nevertheless, considering that Costa Rica generally supports the U.S. in international fora, especially in the areas of democracy and human rights, modern day relations are very strong. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 41% of Costa Ricans approve of U.S. leadership, while 15% disapproving and 44% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup History Costa Rica and The United States have maintained formal diplomatic relations since 1851. The United States is Costa Rica's most important trading partner., see Economy tab, Export Partners and Import Partners of Costa Rica. October 14, 2010. Retrieved 2013-01-08. The two countries share growing concerns for the environment and want to preserve Costa Rica's tropical resources and prevent environmental degradation. In 2007, the United States reduced Costa Rica's debt in exchange for protection and conservation of Costa Rican forests through a debt for nature swap under the auspices of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. This is the largest such agreement of its kind to date. This deal between both governments generated 50 million dollars which were devoted to conservation projects. Through provision of more than $100 million in assistance, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supported Costa Rican efforts to stabilize its economy and broaden and accelerate economic growth through policy reforms and trade liberalization. Assistance initiatives in the 1990s concentrated on democratic policies, modernizing the administration of justice, and sustainable development. Once the country had graduated from most forms of U.S. assistance, the USAID Mission in Costa Rica closed in 1996. However, USAID completed a $9 million project in 2000-01 to support refugees of Hurricane Mitch residing in Costa Rica., see US-CR relations 3rd paragraph. Relations between the two countries took a dip in the 1980s when the Reagan administration used Costa Rican territory to attack the Sandinista government of Costa Rica's northern neighbor Nicaragua against the wishes of the Costa Rican government. The administration of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias prohibited the handful of former U.S. officials from entering Costa Rica after a congressional commission found that their actions to resupply the contra rebels led to drug trafficking by contra pilots. The Bush Administration stopped international financial organization loans to the government of Costa Rica after Arias expropriated land on which a secret mile-long airstrip was built.‚ÄúPoint West: The Political History of the Guanacaste National Park Project‚Äù More than 3,370 Peace Corps volunteers have served in Costa Rica since the program was established in 1963.

Bilateral Costa Rican law enforcement cooperation, particularly against drug trafficking, has been successful. However, there was an internal dispute (within Costa Rica) regarding the entrance of United States naval forces as support for U.S. Coast Guard activities. While Costa Rica is concerned about the threat of illegal drug-related activities, it has a tradition of demilitarization and peaceful conflict resolution. Costa Rican Congressman Luis Fishman stated his concern saying that \\"This gives a blank check to American troops\\", while opposition legislator Juan Carlos Mendoza added, \\"The type of armament leads one to believe that these operations are more military in character, rather than for combating drug trafficking\\". There was also an online petition against the entry of U.S. naval vessels, which received over 4,200 signatures, and the mobilization of protestors.

The TAO framework provides an open architecture for computer- assisted test development and delivery, with the potential to respond to the whole range of evaluation needs. It provides to all the actors of the entire computer-based assessment process a comprehensive set of functionalities enabling the creation, the management, and the delivery of electronic assessments. The TAO platform is developed by the EMACS research unit of the University of Luxembourg and the SSI department of the Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor.  Overview  The TAO framework is an open-source project which provides a very general and open architecture for computer-assisted test development and delivery. As upcoming evaluation needs will imply the collaboration among a large number of stakeholders situated at different institutional levels and with very different needs for assessment tools, the TAO framework has the ambition to provide a modular and versatile framework for collaborative distributed test development and delivery with the potential to be extended and adapted to virtually every evaluation purpose that could be handled by the means of computer-based assessment. In order to reach this goal, the testing problem has been broken down into its constitutive parts: * Item development and management * Subject management * Test development and management * Group management * Test delivery management * Results management These parts are implemented under the form of multiple specialized modules connected in a peer-to-peer network. As the TAO architecture should fit into many different use cases, there is no central node in the system (the whole network of TAO nodes is an open-system with no global consistency) and it is assumed that there cannot be an a priori model for each data domain that reaches consensus within all the actors. On the contrary, each module owner or user is free to build the model that best corresponds to his own view. In order to support this model diversity, TAO modules are equipped with advanced modelling functionalities allowing users to build dynamically their own model and share data organized according to different models.  Features  ;General features * Multilingual application - user interface as well as data is supported in most languages (European languages, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Turkish, etc.) * Web application - full Internet access without installation of any client application, except well-known and widely used browser plug-ins. * Groupware ‚Äì collaboration of diverse users independent of location and time * User management * Rights management * Classification, modelisation of resources * Open for new graphical layouts * Fulltext search * API providing all services (to access, modify data, manage users, ‚Ä¶) * Semantic web standard (RDF/RDFS) * Import/export functions (ontologies) ;Item development and management * QTI 2.1 and 2.2 items import, export and editing * WYSIWYG authoring * Integration of any multimedia resource (images, sound, text, videos, animations) * Items sharing and item banking * Preview of created item during design phase ;Test development and management * Selection of items among different item modules * Support for QTI 2.2 test import, export and editing ;Subject management * Assignation of logins/passwords for subjects to access tests * Generic process to formalize any sort of dataset for a set of subjects using the common set of input components ;Group management * Populate groups with subjects of different subject modules) * Assign tests to a group of selected subjects ;Test delivery management * Test is available on any system (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) using any browser (Mozilla, Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera) * Online- and Offline-testing * Deliver assessment offline but store answers * Delivery planning ;Results management * Wizard to build tables with results * Export results to QTI 2.2 results or CSV files * Wizard to create report with multiple scores combined  TAO Architecture  The description of the platform architecture at the current stage is organized on a component basis. A part of these components are independent from the computer-assisted testing domain. The TAO platform should be considered as a particular instantiation (for a particular purpose) of a more general platform dedicated to the collaborative and distributed management of web resources and of the ontologies describing these resources. The more specific components will be presented afterward. The TAO platform consists in a series of interconnected modules. Each module is a specialization of a more generic kernel application called Generis4. The specialization consists in adding a specific model to the kernel defining the domain of specialization, several plug-ins providing specific functionalities to the specialization according to the domain and relying on specific properties of the model, possibly some external applications, and a specific (optional) user graphical interface.  TAO Modules  TAO is designed as a modular system. This decentralised structure is necessary on one hand to maintain the anonymity of the Subjects and on the other hand to allow the collaboration among several users, to change items and tests. The modules may be placed on the same server or on different servers connected through the internet or local area networks. There is a distinction between the portal of test execution (Delivery Server) and the servers of the different modules, providing the information about Subjects, Groups, Items, Tests, Deliveries and Results. In the Subject module the testees are recorded and managed. Its flexibility allows the design of datasheets (e.g. name, address, birthday, gender, etc.). The Subjects may be assigned to sets according to the specific assessment context (Human resources management, education, edumetric monitoring, etc.). The subjects may be subsumed in regard to global features and classifications in the Group module. The main object of this module is to assign the favoured test(s) to the appointed group. The Subjects and Tests that belong to one group may be originated from different modules on different servers. This module establishes the basis to run a test. The Item module enables the creation and design of items, exercises. Different kinds of templates are provided to the item authors like Multiple Choice Question, puzzle design, Fill-in-the-gap, etc. Any other demands may be added within the scope of further development. A selection of favourite Items ‚Äì originated from different modules on different servers - is combined to a test in the Test module. Furthermore, the test mode (sequencing, scoring, cumulating, etc.) and layout is configured here. In the Delivery module the test administrator will be able to define test campaigns, constraints on test execution (Test may be made available during a given period, Tests may be assigned with a maximum number of executions). This module will also enable to select on which Result module all results should be sent to. The Test Delivery Server provides the compiled tests via URL. The Subjects will access their assigned Test(s) through their logins and passwords. Finally all the results of passed tests with referring Subject, Group, Item and Test specific data as well as the individual data collected during test execution are stored and managed in the Result module.  Item templates  Tests or surveys consist of items (exercises, questions) that may have different characteristics. These characteristics are defined by Item Templates. They describe the way an item is presented. On the basis of a certain template an item is filled with text and/or multimedia elements, the Item Content. This process is called item authoring. The main constituents of a particular item are its underlying Item Template and its specific Item Content. TAO provides the following Item templates (types of items): * QTI: QTI covers 17 interaction types * PCI: Custom Interactions that follow the QTI standard  Publications  *Latour, T. and Martin, R., ERCIM News, 71, October (2007) 32-33.

Diplomatic relations among two countries were established on April 7, 1992 following Croatia's independence from SFR Yugoslavia. The mutual relations continue to be cordial, friendly, and very close. Croatia has an embassy in Washington, D.C., general consulates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and consulates in Anchorage, Kansas City metropolitan area, Pittsburgh, Seattle and Houston. The US has an embassy in Zagreb. American engagement in Croatia is aimed at fostering a democratic, secure, and market-oriented society that will be a strong US partner in Euro- Atlantic institutions. Bilateral relations between the two countries are described as very strong. Croatian diaspora in the US is one of the largest in the world with an estimate of more than 1.2 million members. Most of the Croats live in Chicago (~150,000), New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut (~80,000), St. Louis (~40,000), San Pedro (~35,000), Detroit (~7,000) and San Jose (~5,000). The National Federation of Croatian Americans is the main organization that brings together Croats in the US. Both countries are members of UN, NATO, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization. In addition, Croatia is an observer to the Organization of American States.  Embassy  Embassy of Croatia, Washington, D.C. U.S. Embassy in Zagreb The official presence of the US in Croatia began with the establishment of the US Consulate in Zagreb on May 9, 1946. The consulate become a consulate general on August 1, 1958. US recognised Croatia as an independent state on April 7, 1992. US Consulate General gained status of an embassy on August 25, 1992. First US ambassador to Croatia was Peter W. Galbraith who served on this position from 1993 to 1998. The US Embassy in Croatia is located in Zagreb, southwest of Buzin. This 8000 m¬≤ compound was opened on June 2, 2003. According to an article based on the WikiLeaks documents published in a British newspaper The Independent in 2013, the embassy, namely its fifth floor, is used as a regional base of CIA and NSA. US embassy in Zagreb is a charter member of the League of Green Embassies and a founding member of the Zagreb Green Building Council. According to this, embassy support recycling, energy and water use reduction programs. The embassy also sponsors American Corners at libraries in Osijek, Rijeka, Zadar, and Zagreb. As of November 2017, the US ambassador to Croatia is William Robert Kohorst.  History  The Republic of Ragusa, a merchant republic centered at the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, was one of the first foreign countries to de iure recognize independence of the United States. Sources differ on when the recognition took place: some travel guides and tourist portals claim that Ragusa was the very first country to recognize the United States as early as 1776, a document whose copy was presented to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney in 2006 reportedly puts the date at 1783, while the Council of American Ambassadors claims that the recognition was extended during the term of the second President of the United States, John Adams, thus between 1797 and 1801. = Visits of U.S. Presidents to Croatia = St. Mark's Square The first U.S. President to visit Croatia was Richard Nixon, who came to Zagreb on 2 October 1970 during his state visit to Yugoslavia. The choice to visit Zagreb during political and cultural developments in Socialist Republic of Croatia that would culminate in the Croatian Spring, along with Nixon's praise for the \\"spirit of Croatia\\" and his exclamation \\"Long live Croatia! Long live Yugoslavia!\\", has been interpreted as a statement of support for Croatian identity and greater autonomy within the federal framework of Yugoslavia. The first U.S. President to visit independent Croatia was Bill Clinton on 13 January 1996. Clinton spent a few hours on the Zagreb Airport while returning from visiting IFOR troops in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the brief visit, Clinton gave a speech in front of a crowd waving Croatian and American flags, then met with Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman. On 4 April 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush arrived in Zagreb on an official 2-day state visit. The visit immediately followed the 2008 Bucharest summit of NATO countries where Croatia and Albania received invitations to join the alliance. Bush met with President of Croatia Stipe Mesiƒá and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, and gave a speech in St. Mark's Square in downtown Zagreb. Peaceful rallies were held during the visit to protest U.S. foreign policy and impending Croatian NATO membership. =Visit of Hillary Clinton to Croatia (2012)= Ivo Josipoviƒá and Hillary Clinton US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Croatia on October 30, 2012. During her visit she met with many Croatian officials including President Ivo Josipoviƒá, Prime Minister Zoran Milanoviƒá and Foreign Minister Vesna Pusiƒá. Main topics of discussions were Croatian role in NATO and the Croatian accession to the European Union as well as economic relations between US and Croatia. Secretary Clinton called Croatia \\"a leader in Southeast Europe\\" that had well educated workforce, established infrastructure, great geopolitical location, adding that it was promising destination but that there was still a necessity for additional reforms, increase of transparency, elimination of bureaucratic barriers, as well as the privatization of the companies that are still owned by the state. =Visit of Joe Biden to Croatia (2015)= On November 25, 2015 US Vice President Joe Biden visited Croatia as a special guest of the Brdo-Brijuni Process Leaders' Summit that brings together heads of state from the countries of former Yugoslavia and Albania as well as special guests. The summit was co- chaired by Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá and Slovenian President Borut Pahor. Discussed topics on the plenary session were integration of south-east Europe into Euro-Atlantic processes, migrant crisis, security challenges and the fight against terrorism, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as energy. Vice President Biden stated: \\"For the United States and for me personally, but I am speaking on behalf of the President Obama, this region has been of extreme interest for the last 25 years.\\" In addition, Biden praised Brdo-Brijuni initiative as \\"a good job as it has managed to bring together heads of state for talks for the past five years\\". Vice President Biden also met with the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanoviƒá and Foreign Minister Vesna Pusiƒá with whom he talked about situation in the Middle East, especially about the war in Syria, migrant crisis and the security situation in the world after 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. =Visit of Mike Pompeo to Croatia (2020)= On October 2, 2020 U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo visited Dubrovnik, where he had a meeting with Croatia‚Ä≤s prime minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá and other Croatian government officials. Following the meeting, the Croatian foreign minister said that Croatia had signed no document whereby it would undertake to refrain from co-operating with China on the issues of security with a view to 5G. Pompeo‚Ä≤s visit was foreshadowed by statements made by Croatia‚Ä≤s president Zoran Milanoviƒá, who harshly criticised the U.S. top leaders, saying, among other things, that Donald Trump had ruined the international reputation of the United States. Military cooperation United States Army general Martin Dempsey and Croatian general Drago Lovriƒá Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanoviƒá and United States Army general Martin Dempsey Soldiers from the Minnesota Army National Guard train with members of the Croatian army during military exercises Guardex 12 in 2012 Croatian Air Force and US Navy aircraft participate in multinational training. As of January 2020, the U.S. State Department‚Ä≤s web site alleged that the U.S. Department of Defense had \\"a robust military-to-military relationship with Croatia\\" with the U.S. providing military assistance to Croatia in the form of training, equipment, equipment loans, and education in U.S. military schools. In April 2014, Croatia took delivery of 30 U.S. MRAP vehicles out of the 212 MRAP vehicles that the U.S. government had decided on donating to Croatia. The U.S. and Croatia work together in these 11 military programs, funds and initiatives: * Foreign Military Financing - FMF -Croatia received from this program from 2000 until FMF's suspension in 2003 $18.5 million. Once FMF was launched again in 2008 Croatia received addition $14.5 million. Croatia spent this money mostly on purchase of communication systems, simulators and equipment for night surveillance. * Foreign Military Sales - FMS -Croatia bought $4.2 billion worth products from this program; flight equipment, communications devices, night vision equipment and software's for Croatia's Main Simulation Centre. * Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative - GPOI -Around $5.1 million that Croatia received from this Program was spent for equipping two classrooms for foreign language learning in Knin and Na≈°ice, buying navigation equipment and equipment for the night flying, as well as for training helicopter pilots for the night flights. * Program - article 1206 - Train and Equip -From this program Croatia received from 2010-2014 $31 million. With this money Croatia bought HMMWV vehicles for training, communication and navigation equipment, equipment for night surveillance, labeling and identification of army vehicles and MILES 2000 adjustment system for Croatian VHS-D rifle. In 2015, Croatia received $11 million for purchasing communications equipment and training its special forces. * The program - article 1202 - Enhanced ACSA (Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreements) -Through this program US lends its allies that are participating in missions in Afghanistan and Iraq military equipment for a period of approximately one year. Croatia received through this program 50 HMMWV and 12 MRAP vehicles [which Croatia kept as a gift after the end of missions in Afghanistan and Iraq], ballistic missiles and systems for command, control and communication (Blue Force Tracking). * Excess Defense Articles - EDA -Through this program Croatia bought 212 used MRAP vehicles: 162 M-ATV, 30 Navistar MaxxPro Plus, and 20 medical vehicles MRAP HAGA. * Coalition Support Funds - CSF -Through this program Croatia received from the US partial refund of its money invested in ISAF missions in which Croatia participated from 2011 until 2013. $16.9 million were refunded to Croatia. This money will be used for improving maritime radar Enhanced Peregrine. * International Military Education and Training - IMET -Croatia at first participated in this program from 1995 to 2003 when it got banned from participating due to some diplomatic disagreements between US and Croatia. On October 2, 2006 George W. Bush with his decree abolished the restraining Croatia from participating in IMET program \\"because of the Croatian importance for US national interests\\". Croatia through the IMET program implemented over 600 activities with costs estimated at about $9 million. * Cooperative Logistic Support Supply Arrangement - CLSS -Croatia signed this agreement and become part of the US logistics data base. This agreement enables Croatia to independently buy spare parts for its HMMWV vehicles which wouldn't be possible without this agreement because the only authorized buyer of spare parts for HMMWV is the US and anyone that wants to buy any spare parts has to ask US for permission. * Man- portable air-defense system - MANPADS -US donated to Croatia cca. $2 million through this program so Croatia could destroy some of its anti-aircraft systems that are dysfunctional. * The program of demining and the destruction of surplus munitions -US donated to Croatia cca. $2.5 million through this program for demining and destroying some Croatian surplus munitions. Both countries are full members of NATO. On August 5, 2015 Croatia has held a big military parade, featuring thousands of soldiers, military vehicles and jets, to mark the 20th anniversary of Operation Storm, a key offensive in its independence struggle. USA sent a delegation composed of its top officials: Commander of the Minnesota National Guard, Gen. Richard C. Nash, deputy commander of US forces in Europe, Gen. Randz A. Kee, US Defense Attache Douglas M. Faherty and US Ambassador to Croatia Kenneth Merten. Economic cooperation Economic relations between Croatia and US are very good. In 2013 Croatia exported $327,992.000 worth goods to the US and imported from it $221,794.000 worth goods. US is the most important Croatian trade partner in North America in front of Cayman Islands and Canada, and eighth most important in the world. In 2013, 220,043 Americans, who have made 548,727 overnight stays, came to Croatia on a holiday. The United States and Croatia have a bilateral investment treaty and investment protection agreement. Despite Croatia having numerous direct services to the United States when it was part of Yugoslavia prior to the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars in the early 1990s, it wasn't until July 2019 that direct services resumed. American Airlines flies to Dubrovnik from Philadelphia seasonally. In addition, the United States has given more than $27 million since 1998 in humanitarian assistance to Croatia. The US also has provided additional financial assistance to Croatia through the Southeastern European Economic Development Program (SEED) to facilitate democratization and restructuring of Croatia's financial sector, largely through programs managed by USAID.

Cyprus maintains an embassy at Washington, D.C. and a consulate general in New York City. The United States Department of State retains detail information about Cyprus and US relations and operations. Wilbur Ross, the acting United States Secretary of Commerce, was a major shareholder and vice chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus, after he invested ‚Ç¨400 million in the bank in 2014. Prior to his appointment, Ross was a successful banker known for acquiring and restructuring companies and later selling them for a profit once operations have been improved. Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround management Association. War on Terror The United States is also working closely with Cyprus in the War on Terrorism. A mutual legal assistance treaty, which has been in force since September 18, 2002, facilitates bilateral cooperation. Cyprus also signed a Proliferation Security Initiative with the United States on July 25, 2005, which reinforces bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation. Joint Energy Projects The US respects the rights of Cyprus to develop its resources in its EEZ and has repeated caution to Turkeys destabilizing Oil & Gas research within Cyprus EEZ. The \\"US remains deeply concerned by Turkey‚Äôs repeated attempts to conduct drilling operations in the waters off Cyprus... This provocative step raises tensions in the region. We urge Turkish authorities to halt these operations and encourage all parties to act with restraint and refrain from actions that increase tensions in the region\\" stated Morgan Ortagus of the United States Department of State in 2019. Cyprus has called on Turkey to delineate the sea boundaries between the two countries. US position on Cyprus Dispute The United States and The Republic of Cyprus established official diplomatic relations in 1960, right after the British Cyprus's independence from the United Kingdom. Differences immediately arose between the majority Greek Cypriot (77.1%) and minority Turkish Cypriot (18.2%) communities during the implementation of the Constitution of Cyprus provided at the time. Subsequently, inter-communal violence led to the establishment of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus in 1964. In 1974, a Coup d'√©tat backed by the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974 failed to provide Enosis (union) with Greece. Subsequently a Turkish invasion of Cyprus has followed, that resulted in the capture of approximately 40% of the island and a de facto division of its people and land since 1974. Today, the Republic of Cyprus is the only official government of the island state, however, more than 1/3 of the north is administered by Turkish Cypriots, through the ‚ÄúTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus‚Äù proclaimed in 1983. The United States, does not recognize the ‚ÄúTRNC,‚Äù nor does any other country in the world except Turkey. About 30,000 Turkish Troops remain on the island while the \\"Green line\\" buffer zone is patrolled by UNFICYP. The United States regards the status quo on the Cyprus dispute as \\"unacceptable\\" and fully supports the UN-led inter-communal negotiations as the rightful venue to achieve a fair settlement. In December 2019, the US Congress lifted a decades- old arms embargo on Cyprus. On 2 September 2020, United States decided to lift embargo on selling \\"non-lethal\\" military goods to Cyprus for one year starting from 1 October. US Bi-communal Support Since the 1970s, the US has channeled millions in assistance to both communities and sponsors programs to increase cooperation between the two communities. Following the Annan Plan, the U.S. devoted an additional funding to assist the economic development of the Turkish Cypriots, in order to reduce future settlement costs. In 2000, the US Embassy established a Bicommunal Support Program that is focused on professional development, education and leadership. The UNDP‚Äôs Action for Cooperation and Trust program is also working with Cypriot organizations to help build relationships island-wide. The focus is on multicultural education and youth empowerment, promoting civil engagement, support to environmental protection and the preservation and promotion of Cyprus‚Äôs cultural heritage. The Cyprus Partnership for Economic Growth (CyPEG) was also designed to promote business interaction and trade between the communities. Thousands of Cypriots have made friends with members of the ‚Äúother‚Äù community as a result of these programs. US scholarships to Cypriots Due to the massive flow of Cypriot under-graduate and post graduate students Cyprus-America Scholarship Program (CASP) offers scholarships for Cypriot students wanting to pursue a bachelor's degree in the United States. The CASP competition is open for bachelor's degrees in all fields except Medicine and Dentistry. A Bachelor's Degree in the United States usually takes four years. The scholarship is for a maximum amount of $25,000 each year, for a maximum total of $100,000.  Embassies  The Embassy of the United States is located in Nicosia, Cyprus.

Approaching everyday life with a defiant ability to find beauty and oddness he coined many new words describing feelings and situations previously unaccounted for in Danish. This gave him a reputation for being an eccentric with a slanted and highly personal use of language, but also brought him much acclaim among peers and a large fan base.

History Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen shakes hands with US President Donald Trump at the 2019 NATO summit Diplomatic relations date back to 1783, when Denmark signed a commercial treaty with the United States. In 1792, Denmark recognized the independence of the United States. In 1801, diplomatic relations were established, and an American legation was opened in Denmark. The diplomatic relations have never experienced an interruption, since 1801. In 1801, Denmark became an ally of France and its war against Great Britain, and the Danish Navy seized American merchant ships. A treaty of commerce was signed in 1826, and Denmark agreed to pay the United States an indemnity of $650,000. During the American Civil War, Washington proposed to purchase the Danish West Indies to better maintain its blockade of the Confederacy. The United States Senate refused to go along, and negotiations continued intermittently for five more decades, but both sides had internal opposition. =World War I= Denmark was neutral in World War I, but suffered a significant disruption in trade, and decided its colonies were a financial burden, especially as the inhabitants were restive. The United States did not want Germany to purchase the islands of Saint Thomas, Saint Croix, and Saint John.Bruce W. Jentleson and Thomas G. Paterson, eds. Encyclopedia of US foreign relations. (1997) 2:8. In 1916, Denmark sold their Danish West Indies to the United States, and both countries signed the Treaty of the Danish West Indies. The sale for $25 million deal was finalized on 17 January 1917. On 31 March 1917, the United States took possession of the islands and the territory was renamed the Virgin Islands of the United States.Fogdall, Soren, Danish-American diplomacy, 1776-1920 (1922) Online =World War II= During World War II, in April 1941, the United States worked with Henrik Kauffmann Denmark's ambassador to Washington to establish a temporary protectorate over Greenland.Bo Lidegaard, Defiant Diplomacy: Henrik Kauffmann, Denmark, and the United States in World War II and the Cold War, 1939-1958 (Peter Lang, 2003). Rejecting Denmark's long history of neutrality, it joined NATO as a founding member in 1949. The country remains a member but there has always been a strong anti-NATO element in left-wing Danish circles. In December 1995, Danish troops deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the United Nations peacekeeping force were assigned to the American sector, coming under direct American command.Jentleson and Paterson, eds. Encyclopedia of US foreign relations. (1997) 2:9. Political relations A Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Colonial Coffee service gifted to American President Gerald Ford by Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik of Denmark. Denmark is a close NATO ally, and relations are described as \\"excellent\\". Denmark is active in Afghanistan and Kosovo as well as a leader in the Baltic region. Former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen reaffirmed that Denmark would remain engaged in Iraq even as its troop levels declined. Denmark was the only Scandinavian country to approve of the American Invasion of Iraq, and Denmark and the United States consult closely on European political and security matters. Denmark shares U.S. views on the positive ramifications of NATO enlargement. Denmark is an active coalition partner in the War on Terrorism, and Danish troops are supporting American-led stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States also engages Denmark in a broad cooperative agenda through the Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe; The U.S. policy structure to strengthen U.S.-Nordic-Baltic policy and program coordination. Trade Denmark's active liberal trade policy in the European Union, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and World Trade Organization largely coincides with U.S. interests. The U.S. is Denmark's largest non-European trade partner with about 5% of Danish merchandise trade. Denmark's role in European environmental and agricultural issues and its strategic location at the entrance to the Baltic Sea have made Copenhagen a center for U.S. agencies and the private sector dealing with the Nordic/Baltic region. Greenland Shortly before the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire, United States Secretary of State William H. Seward attempted to buy both Greenland and Iceland from Denmark, but was unsuccessful. Following World War II, the United States developed a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100,000,000, but Denmark refused to sell. Thule Air Base, the U.S. Air Force base and early warning radar at Thule, Greenland a Danish self-governing territory serve as a vital link in Western defenses. In August 2004, the Danish and Greenland Home Rule governments gave permission for the early warning radar to be updated in connection with a role in the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. At the same time, agreements were signed to enhance economic, technical, and environmental cooperation between the United States and Greenland. On 10 June 2020, the United States reopened its Consulate in Nuuk, Greenland. The first U.S. Consulate in Nuuk closed in 1953.U.S. Consulate Nuuk =1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash= The 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash was an accident on 21 January 1968, involving a United States Air Force B-52 bomber. The aircraft was carrying four hydrogen bombs on a Cold War \\"Chrome Dome\\" alert mission over Baffin Bay when a cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft before they could carry out an emergency landing at Thule Air Base. Six crew members ejected safely, but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out. The bomber crashed onto sea ice in North Star Bay, Greenland, causing the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse, which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination. The United States and Denmark launched an intensive clean-up and recovery operation, but the secondary of one of the nuclear weapons could not be accounted for after the operation completed. =Proposed purchase by the United States in 2019= Tweet by Donald Trump announcing the postponement of his first visit to Denmark as president In 2019, President Donald Trump discussed the idea of purchasing Greenland with senior advisers. Numerous Greenlandic and Danish politicians, including the Premier of Greenland and the Prime Minister of Denmark, rebuffed the idea, saying that the island is not for sale. A few days later, Trump abruptly postponed a planned state visit to Denmark just days before, citing their unwillingness to discuss his proposal of buying Greenland. State visits Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik of Denmark welcome George W. Bush and Laura Bush, 2005. In 1967, Princess Margrethe and Prince Henrik visited the United States. Former President Bill Clinton visited Denmark in 1997, and again in 2007. American President George W. Bush made an official visit to Copenhagen in July 2005, and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen met with Bush at Camp David in June 2006. Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama traveled to Denmark to support the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics in October 2009, and in December 2009, Obama visited Denmark again for the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In March 2009, former Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen met former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Gaza Donor Conference, and again in a NATO meeting in April 2010, where they met in Estonia. In March 2009, Crown Prince Frederik and Princess Mary visited the Midwest. They visited The Danish Home in Chicago, and the Danish villages of Elk Horn, Ames, Kimballton and the Grand View University in Iowa. In Nebraska, the couple visited Dana College. \\"States like Iowa and Nebraska boast numerous examples of Danish settlements... Both universities have made great strides to become highly recognized institutions of higher learning, as well as strengthening ties between Denmark and the United States,\\" Crown Prince Frederik said. On 9 March 2011, Obama met with former Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen in the White House, where they discussed counter-terrorism, the Arab Spring and environmental issues. On 30 March 2017, Rasmussen visited President Donald Trump in the United States. Discussion points were the state of the bilateral relations as well as counter-terrorism, economic opportunities, and NATO. On 20 August 2019, President Donald Trump abruptly postponed a state visit to Denmark just days before after the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had declined Trump's offer to buy Greenland, saying that the island is not for sale.

Over the past decade, the United States has been a principal provider of humanitarian assistance for famine relief and has sponsored health care, education, good governance and security assistance programs. Djibouti has allowed the U.S. military, as well as other nations' militaries, access to its port and airport facilities. The Djiboutian Government has been very supportive of U.S. and Western interests particularly during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91 and after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Though often thought of as a long drought, until the record dry year of 1902 the period was actually one of a number of very dry spells interspersed with wetter weather. Dry conditions gradually became established during the late 1890s and several dry areas joined together to create the end result of a drought covering more than half the continent. Beginnings Except for a widespread El Nino drought in 1888, the late 1880s and early 1890s were a period of extremely heavy rainfallHunt, H.A.;Results of rain and river observations made in New South Wales during 1903-1908 with maps and diagrams : and including all available annual rainfall totals up to the end of the year 1908 from 2,298 stations; published 1909 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology over New South Wales, Queensland and to a lesser extent Victoria and the \\"settled\\" areas of Tasmania and South Australia. Lake Eyre is believed to have filled with water from Cooper Creek in 1886/1887, 1889/1890 and 1894.Allen, R. J.; The Australasian Summer Monsoon, Teleconnections, and Flooding in the Lake Eyre Basin; pp. 41-42. Royal Geographical Society of Australasia. South Australian Branch. Lake Eyre Committee. Lake Eyre, South Australia : the great flooding of 1949-50; published 1995 by Lake Eyre Committee. The wet spell of the early 1890s ended earliest in the area between Melbourne and Sydney, where rainfall in 1894 was below normal even as much of inland Queensland and New South Wales had one of their wettest years on record. A very hot November with temperatures reaching made the situation critical in some areas. Though Sydney had heavy rainfall in January and February 1895, from March that year drought began spreading widely across New South Wales and Victoria. The winter that year was the driest on record in Sydney, and despite a relieving fall during September, Sydney's rainfall for the period March to December was the third- lowest on record. The winter was dominated by very strong westerly winds to quite low latitudes and was very wet in southwestern Australia and wet in the Adelaide region and Western District of Victoria, but only about average in the drier areas further inland. Over all of Victoria and South Australia, however, extremely dry weather in October and November was sufficient to cause the failure of many wheat crops, whilst in East Gippsland these months saw unprecedented rainless spells. 1896 These years began with a hot spell and numerous bushfires especially in Gippsland, which had suffered two years of deficient rainfall. Despite a very powerful monsoon in the north, heavy rains therefrom during February only broke the drought temporarily, as El Ni√±o developed later that year. Despite El Ni√±o, drought-stricken Gippsland has one of its wettest winters on record as a series of storms produced torrential rains between Melbourne and Sydney‚Äîand around Hobart‚Äîin June and again in August. Early in September, huge floods occurred on East Gippsland streams as Orbost received in three days, but inland Victoria and New South Wales had been dry ever since May and the rest of September and October were almost completely dry, leading to another wheat crop failure. November was very wet in northern New South Wales, but still dry further south, whilst in the settled areas of South Australia dry conditions had been much worse, with no above-average rainfall since April. 1897 This year began with cool, moist summer weather in most of Victoria and New South Wales, but conditions in Queensland, which had continued to have heavy rain during the \\"wet\\" season in 1895 and 1896 became drier. In inland districts the first transition to drought began as February and March were distinctly dry. April was particularly dry despite the breakdown of El Ni√±o, as was May except in Gippsland, but June and July were very wet over inland New South Wales and northern Victoria (it was the wettest winter on record at some stations such as Nyngan and Echuca). August saw good rains shift to South Australia and coastal Victoria, but despite continued good rains in September and October over inland New South Wales water supplies did not really recover owing to a very dry November and a hot December in inland regions, which saw temperatures again reach in many parts of Victoria and not much less in Tasmania, where rainfall had again been deficient throughout the winter. Heavy rains on the North Coast of New South Wales were of little use to an agricultural sector that was seeing many inland properties demonstrably overstocked based on expectations of higher rainfall than was falling.Foley, J.C.; Droughts in Australia : review of records from earliest years of settlement to 1955; published 1957 by Australian Bureau of Meteorology 1898 The heatwave conditions during December 1897 continued early this year as Melbourne set a still-standing record mean maximum for February of . The northeast of New South Wales was deluged by moist easterly winds and a low-pressure system that moved over inland Victoria with valuable rain later gave the South Coast some of the heaviest rainfall ever known in Australia: Bega had in five days, or more rainfall than it has received in two-fifths of all complete years. However, despite continued heavy rain and flooding in Queensland and the North Coast of New South Wales in March, extremely dry conditions were established over all the rest of southeastern Australia and good rains in South Australia during April and May had little effect inland despite producing heavy rain in Gippsland - which had been rainless since the beginning of the year apart from its February deluge. Although a weak La Ni√±a began developing and June was very wet over most of South Australia and inland Victoria, it was still dry in Tasmania and southern Victoria, and July was dry generally except in Tasmania and the southeast of South Australia. August, though wet in southwestern Australia and the west of New South Wales, was extremely dry in the worst-hit areas of southern Victoria, whilst useful September rains did little to ameliorate the situation there. November was very dry except in Tasmania and South Gippsland, and December even worse except in areas of the Mallee affected by thunderstorms. Despite 1898 being wet over most of Queensland, it was very dry in the northwestern slopes of New South Wales and much of southern Victoria. in Melbourne, 1898 was the driest year until 1967, and in Orbost it is still the third-driest year on record. 1899 This year saw southern Victoria and Tasmania have heavy rains in January, as did Queensland, whilst February and March - though dry in New South Wales - again saw good rains there as cold fronts linked with tropical moisture. March and April saw heavy rains in southern Victoria continue, but these months were still dry in inland New South Wales and Queensland. With El Ni√±o returning, however, May was very dry in most inland districts, but June was‚Äîwelcomingly as it turned out‚Äîextremely wet in Victoria and northeastern South Australia. July, however, saw some of the coldest conditions on record in the grain country: in Melbourne, the mean minimum temperature of is the lowest on record and in many places sub-zero minima were general on most days during July and August. Adelaide had its driest July on record with a total of only . The anticyclonic conditions, however, created a strong onshore flow that gave the cost of New South Wales almost continuous heavy rain: in Sydney the winter of 1899 was the second-wettest on record. Major flooding occurred on most coastal rivers. Dry conditions continued throughout the rest of the year except on the coast of New South Wales, and only the heavy June falls prevented grain crops being a total failure. By the end of 1899, El Ni√±o was already producing a very poor northern monsoon, and apart from the southeast December was unusually dry throughout Queensland, and also the Top End and Kimberley. 1900 The early part of this year saw one of the most complete monsoon failures in the north of Australia, especially in normally wet Cape York Peninsula where the year proved the driest on record at many stations. In February, a major heatwave and dust storms hit southeastern Australia. Although the monsoon did not return in the north, March saw the beginning of a very wet period in Victoria, South Australia, and most of Western Australia as northwest cloudbands generated repeated heavy rain. With the associated troughs developing into low pressure systems in the Tasman Sea, Melbourne and most of South Gippsland had their wettest autumn on record. On 17 May, the Yarra River was flooded and a few days later the torrential rain extended to Sydney and the south coast of New South Wales, which saw further heavy rain in June and July - in the latter case after most unseasonable rain had hit tropical northwestern Australia. In the process snow fell to low levels in New South Wales. Tasmania and Queensland remained very dry as a result of missing the heavy autumn falls, and after some heavy rain in August over the settled areas of South Australia and southwestern Western Australia, dry conditions returned to the continent in a fashion more decisive than at any earlier stage of the drought. Almost the whole continent apart from the southeast of Western Australia was below average for the September to December period, with October being the third- driest on record in Brisbane. A promising season for the wheat and pastoral industries thus became mediocre at best. 1901 The monsoon in Queensland was again very poor apart from the Wet Tropics and Cape York, and in February an extremely active and vigorous monsoon low over inland South Australia brought further east not rain but a disastrous heatwave with Melbourne reporting its hottest February temperature () until 1983. March was wet over northwestern Queensland, the Moreton region, South Gippsland and Tasmania, but the rains did not extend into the dry reaches of the continent. Then, despite a torrential downpour ( in three days at Melbourne) producing another big Yarra flood in April, May to July was generally dry apart from June in southern coastal areas and the settled parts of South Australia, besides which June was also very cold. During July, a huge cold outbreak produced record low maximum temperatures at many places. Snow astonishingly fell as far north as Winton and at Daylesford the temperature on 26 July never rose above .Hunt, H.A.; Results of rainfall observations made in Victoria during 1840-1910: including all available annual rainfall totals from 1,114 stations : together with maps and diagrams; published 1911 by the Ministry of Home Affairs A record wet August over New South Wales and adjacent areas of Queensland and Victoria proved no more than a temporary respite. Very dry conditions set in in September over New South Wales, again affecting crop yields severely, and despite the first half of spring being distinctly wet over Victoria and Tasmania and these rains extending as far north as the Eyre Peninsula and Condobolin, November and December were exceedingly dry - sixth-driest and second-driest averaged over Australia since 1900. 1902 Although dry conditions had been a feature over significant parts of the continent since 1894, it was only this year that large-scale drought began to become genuinely disastrous. January and February were wet over Tasmania, but distinctly dry further north, and despite a heavy storm over southern Victoria and the settled areas of South Australia, March continued the trend of complete summer rainfall failure in New South Wales and Queensland. Most areas of those two states had their lowest rainfall for the November to March period on record, and April was even worse‚Äîbeing averaged over Australia, the driest month of the twentieth century, with a rainfall of only . Sheep and cattle over the inland pastoral districts were already starving, and so extensive was the drought that agistment was not available in any place to which transport could be arranged. The result was that sheep died in numbers that have never been equalled before or since: some sources estimate that half the sheep population was lost in the drought.R. S. G. Rutherford, R. S. G.; \\"Fluctuations in the Sheep Population of New South Wales, 1860-1940: A Preliminary Study\\"; in Economic Record 24 (1), 56‚Äì71, 1948. Although in southwestern Australia‚Äîoften looked upon as a \\"saviour\\" when the rains fail further east‚Äîthe rainy season began on time in May, the dry weather continued without a break in the eastern states. Then, despite June being quite wet in southern Victoria, Tasmania and even parts of South Australia, the month's rain was associated with cold outbreaks that produced extremely severe frosts and several cases of low-level snowfalls. Oatlands recorded a temperature as low as during one of these outbreaks, and snow fell in Hobart. Worse still, northern New South Wales and southern Queensland remained as dry as ever, and southwestern Australia was very dry. Despite torrential rains in July around Eden and heavy rains in the far southwest of Western Australia, rainless or near-rainless conditions continued elsewhere with extremely severe frosts. August was the driest-ever winter month in Perth with only , and Melbourne, equally dry, set a record for lowest mean August minimum temperature at broken only in 1943 and 1944. Though September was wet over southern Western Australia and a single heavy storm produced above-average rainfall in eastern Tasmania and southern Victoria, and October saw very heavy coastal rains in New South Wales (Sydney's on the 13th is still its wettest-ever October day), unrelenting dryness inland combined with hot northerly winds saw one of the worst dust storms ever hit Melbourne on 12 November. Any hope for the wheat crop had gone as early as the end of August, and yields were close to the worst ever. Although November 1902 later proved a very wet month in a band of country between about Southern Cross and Jundah, it was still very dry in more coastal areas. Aftermath December 1902 proved the first month since 1898 when most of the continent had heavy rain. Indeed, in southwestern Victoria many stations had their highest daily rainfall on record, resulting in flash flooding. Only the Kimberley, the North Coast of New South Wales and Western Tasmania remained below average. The remainder of the 1902/1903 summer was disappointing and the monsoon generally weak (though parts of Queensland had heavy falls from cyclones) but from March onwards 1903 proved a generally wet year apart from coastal areas of New South Wales and East Gippsland. Cereal crops, which had constantly failed due to frost and lack of spring rainfall, were exceptionally good due to a wet September throughout southern Australia apart from Tasmania and the Western District. It was in these critical spring months where the rainfall deficiencies of the Federation Drought were concentrated, and the return of the spring rains was followed by a strong monsoon over tropical Australia: at Cooktown and Kojonup 1903 is the wettest calendar year on record. Overall for eastern states 1903 came out as the wettest year since 1894, even if its rainfalls were distinctly short of the high marks of the early 1890s except over western Victoria and parts of South Australia. In East Gippsland and coastal regions of New South Wales the entire decade between 1901 and 1910 was consistently dry: Sydney did not exceed its long-term mean rainfall once, and Brisbane did so only twice between 1899 and 1915. Other parts of eastern Australia, even with a significant improvement over falls between 1895 and 1902, rarely saw rainfall during the 1900s and 1910s nearly so heavy as during the early 1890s. Climatologists today frequently view the Federation Drought as a major climate shift across eastern Australia from the wet period of the nineteenth century to a dry spell lasting until the mid-1940s. such an indication is found in many hydrological records, such as that of Lake George near Canberra and many coastal rivers in South Wales.

Overview The United States and the Commonwealth of Dominica have positive bilateral relations. The United States supports the Dominican government's efforts to expand its economic base and to provide a higher standard of living for its citizens. U.S. assistance is primarily channeled through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), as well as through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) office in Bridgetown, Barbados. The Peace Corps also provides technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Dominica, and has volunteers on the island working primarily in education, youth development, and health. The United States and the Commonwealth of Dominica work together in the struggle against illegal drugs. Dominica cooperates with U.S. agencies and participates in counter- narcotics programs in an effort to curb drug trafficking and marijuana cultivation. In 1995, the Dominican government signed a maritime law enforcement agreement with the United States to strengthen counter-narcotics coordination, and in 1996, the government signed mutual legal assistance and extradition treaties to enhance joint efforts in combating international crime. Dominica had around 252,000 visitors in 2005, which represented a contraction in both cruise line and stay-over arrivals over the record performance set in 2004.

There are around 200,000 Americans expats in the Dominican Republic, and a little over 2 million Dominicans live in the Dominican Republic. Overview The country's standing as the largest Caribbean economy, second-largest country in terms of population and land mass, with large bilateral trade with the United States, and its proximity to the United States and other smaller Caribbean nations make the Dominican Republic an important partner in hemispheric affairs. The Embassy estimates that 100,000 U.S. citizens live in the Dominican Republic; many of whom are dual nationals. An important element of the relationship between the two countries is the fact that more than 1 million individuals of Dominican origin reside in the United States, most of them in the metropolitan Northeast and some in Florida. In recent years, there has also been a large wave of migration from the Dominican Republic to neighboring Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory which has many cultural and historical ties to the Dominican Republic. The U.S. occupied the Dominican Republic from 1916 until 1924 and intervened on behalf of the Dominican government during the Dominican Civil War. The Dominican government has been supportive of many U.S. initiatives in the United Nations and related agencies. The two governments cooperate in the fight against the traffic in illegal substances. The Dominican Republic has worked closely with U.S. law enforcement officials on issues such as the extradition of fugitives and measures to hinder illegal migration. The United States supported the Leonel Fern√°ndez administration's efforts to improve Dominican competitiveness, to attract foreign private investment, to fight corruption, and to modernize the tax system. Bilateral trade is important to both countries. U.S. firms, mostly manufacturers of apparel, footwear, and light electronics, as well as U.S. energy companies, account for much of the foreign private investment in the Dominican Republic. Exports from the United States to the Dominican Republic in 2018 totaled US$8.9 billion, up 14% from the previous year. The Dominican Republic exported $5.3 billion to the United States in 2018. The U.S. Embassy works closely with U.S. business firms and Dominican trade groups, both of which can take advantage of the new opportunities in this growing market. At the same time, the Embassy is working with the Dominican government to resolve ongoing commercial and investment disputes. The Embassy counsels U.S. firms through its Country Commercial Guide and informally via meetings with business persons planning to invest or already investing in the Dominican Republic. This is a challenging business environment for U.S. firms, especially for medium to smaller sized businesses. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) mission is focused on improving access of underserved populations to quality health care and combating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB), promoting economic growth through policy reform, support for CAFTA-DR implementation, and technical assistance to small producers and tourism groups; environmental protection and policy reform initiatives; improved access to quality primary, public education and assistance to at-risk youth; a model rural electrification program; and improving participation in democratic processes, while strengthening the judiciary and combating corruption across all sectors.

It consists of the Winchester bushel and its dependent quantities, the peck, (dry) gallon and (dry) quart. They would later become known as the Winchester Standards, named because the examples were kept in the city of Winchester. Winchester measure may also refer to: * the systems of weights and measures used in the Kingdom of Wessex during the Anglo-Saxon period, later adopted as the national standards of England, as well as the physical standards (prototypes) associated with these systems of units * a set of avoirdupois weight standards dating to the mid-14th century, in particular, the 56-pound standard commissioned by King Edward III, which served as the prototype for Queen Elizabeth I's reform of the avoirdupois weight system in 1588 * a type of glass bottle, usually amber, used in the drug and chemical industry, known variously as the Boston round, Winchester bottle, or Winchester quart bottle History During the 10th century, the capital city of the English king, Edgar, was at Winchester and, at his direction, standards of measurement were instituted. However, nothing is known of these standards except that, following the Norman Conquest, the physical standards (prototypes) were removed to London. In 1496, a law of King Henry VII instituted the bushel that would later come to be known by the name \\"Winchester\\". In 1588 Queen Elizabeth I, while reforming the English weight system (which, at the time, included no less than three different pounds going by the name \\"avoirdupois\\") based the new Exchequer standard on an ancient set of bronze weights found at Winchester and dating to the reign of Edward III. These incidents have led to the widespread belief that the Winchester units of dry capacity measure, namely, the bushel and its dependent quantities the peck, gallon and quart, must have originated in the time of King Edgar. However, contemporary scholarship can find no evidence for the existence of any these units in Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. Furthermore, all of the units associated with Winchester measure (quarter, bushel, peck, gallon, pottle, quart, pint) have names of French derivation, at least suggestive of Norman origin. =Capacity Measures in the Anglo-Saxon Period= Prior to the Norman Conquest, the following units of capacity measure were used: sester, amber, mitta, coomb, and seam. A statute of 1196 (9 Richard I c27) decreed: It is established that all measures of the whole of England be of the same amount, as well of corn as of vegetables and of like things, to wit, one good horse load; and that this measure be level as well in cities and boroughs as without. This appears to be a description of the seam, which would later be equated with the quarter. The word seam is of Latin derivation (from the Vulgar Latin sauma = packsaddle). Some of the other units are likewise of Latin derivation, sester from sextarius, amber from amphora. The sester could thus be taken as roughly a pint, the amber a bushel. However, the values of these units, as well as their relationships to one another, varied considerably over the centuries so that no clear definitions are possible except by specifying the time and place in which the units were used. =After the Norman Conquest= One of the earliest documents defining the gallon, bushel and quarter is the Assize of Weights and Measures, also known as the Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris, sometimes attributed to Henry III or Edward I, but nowadays generally listed under Ancient Statutes of Uncertain Date and presumed to be from ‚àí1305. It states, By Consent of the whole Realm the King‚Äôs Measure was made, so that an English Penny, which is called the Sterling, round without clipping, shall weigh Thirty-two Grains of Wheat dry in the midst of the Ear; Twenty-pence make an Ounce; and Twelve Ounces make a Pound, and Eight Pounds make a Gallon of Wine; and Eight Gallons of Wine make a Bushel of London; which is the Eighth Part of a Quarter. In 1496, An Act for Weights and Measures (12 Henry VII c5) stated That the Measure of a Bushel contain Gallons of Wheat, and that every Gallon contain of Wheat of Troy Weight, and every Pound contain Ounces of Troy Weight, and every Ounce contain Sterlings, and every Sterling be of the Weight of Corns of Wheat that grew in the Midst of the Ear of Wheat, according to the old Laws of this Land. Even though this bushel does not quite fit the description of the Winchester bushel, the national standard prototype bushel constructed the following year (and still in existence) is near enough to a Winchester bushel that it is generally considered the first, even though it was not known by that name at the time.Winchester Bushel - Science Museum The Winchester bushel is first mentioned by name in a statute of 1670 entitled An Act for ascertaining the Measures of Corn and Salt (22 Charles II c8) which states, And that if any person or persons after the time aforesaid shall sell any sort of corn or grain, ground or unground, or any kind of salt, usually sold by the bushel, either in open market, or any other place, by any other bushel or measure than that which is agreeable to the standard, marked in his Majesty's exchequer, commonly called the Winchester measure, containing eight gallons to the bushel, and no more or less, and the said bushel strucken even by the wood or brim of the same by the seller, and sealed as this act directs, he or they shall forfeit for every such offence the sum of forty shillings. It is first defined in law by a statute of 1696‚Äì97 (8 & 9 William III c22 s9 & s45) And to the End all His Majesties Subjects may know the Content of the Winchester Bushell whereunto this Act referrs, and that all Disputes and Differences about Measure may be prevented for the future, it is hereby declared that every round Bushel with a plain and even Bottom, being Eighteen Inches and a Halfe wide throughout, & Eight Inches deep, shall be esteemed a legal Winchester Bushel according to the Standard in His Majesty's Exchequer.Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695-1701 (1820), pp. 247-257 In 1824 a new Act was passed in which the gallon was defined as the volume of ten pounds of pure water at with the other units of volume changing accordingly. The \\"Winchester bushel\\", which was some 3% smaller than the new bushel (eight new gallons), was retained in the English grain trade until formally abolished in 1835. In 1836, the United States Department of the Treasury formally adopted the Winchester bushel as the standard for dealing in grain and, defined as 2,150.42 cubic inches, it remains so today. Measures in the city museum None of Edgar's standard measures, which were probably made of wood, remain, but the city's copy of the standard yard, although stamped with the official mark of Elizabeth I, may date from the early twelfth century, during the reign of Henry I. Preserved standard weights date from 1357 and, although the original bushel is lost, a standard bushel, gallon and quart made of bronze, issued in 1497 and stamped with the mark of Henry VII are still held.

Congress appropriated $5,000 for a South Manitou Island light in 1838. A report to the Secretary of the Treasury noted that the island offered shelter from storms and fuel for steamships. The report opined that it was the only all weather harbor admitting large vessels in the 300 mile direct route from the Straits of Mackinac to Chicago. For those in storms, the sight of the beacon would have been a magnificent one, McKinney says. \\"Before the light went on, a man who had been in a boat on a storm-tossed lake in the area of South Manitou recounted the sense of terror he felt. It might have been different after the light's construction, McKinney summed up: \\"All these people on the boat, scared and frightened, look up and see a whitewashed tower with that white light, shining on the lake. It would have looked just like an angel.\\" The light has been the sight of a number of accidents and fatalities.

Between 1948 and 2011, the U.S. provided Egypt with $71.6 billion in bilateral military and economic aid. 1950s and 1960s In 1956, the U.S. was alarmed at the closer ties between Egypt and the Soviet Union, and prepared the OMEGA Memorandum as a stick to reduce the regional power of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. When Egypt recognized Communist China, the U.S. ended talks about funding the Aswan Dam, a high prestige project much desired by Egypt. The dam was later built by the Soviet Union. When Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, the Suez Crisis erupted with Britain and France threatening war to retake control of the canal and depose Nasser. Israel did invade the Suez in October 1956, and Britain and France (in league with Israel) sent in troops to seize the canal. Using heavy diplomatic and economic pressure, the Eisenhower administration forced Britain and France to withdraw soon, leading to a warming of relations between the U.S. and Egypt.Burns, William J. \\"Punishing Nasser.\\" In Economic Aid and American Policy toward Egypt, 1955-1981. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985. Due to U.S. support to Israel, during the Six-Day War, on June 8, 1967, Egypt severed diplomatic relations with USA and expelled Americans in Egypt. During and after the war, Egypt aligned with USSR which airlifted arms and ammunition to rebuild the Egyptian military and sent thousands of advisors to train Egyptian army and managing the air defense. https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Soviet_Israeli_War_1967_1973.html?id=uWlNDwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=kp_read_button&redir;_esc=y 1973‚Äì2011 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat with US President Jimmy Carter outside the White House in 1977. After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Egyptian foreign policy began to shift as a result of the change in Egypt's leadership from the fiery Nasser to the much more moderate Anwar Sadat and the emerging peace process between Egypt and Israel. Sadat realized that reaching a settlement of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict is a precondition for Egyptian development. To achieve this goal, Sadat ventured to enhance U.S.‚ÄìEgyptian relations to foster a peace process with Israel. After a seven-year hiatus, both countries reestablished normal diplomatic relations on February 28, 1974. Sadat asked Moscow for help, and Washington responded by offering more favorable of army's financial aid and technology. The advantages included Egypt's expulsion of 20,000 Soviet advisors and the reopening of the Suez Canal, and were seen by Nixon as \\"an investment in peace.\\" Craig A. Daigle, \\"The Russians are going: Sadat, Nixon and the Soviet presence in Egypt.\\" Middle East 8.1 (2004): 1. Encouraged by Washington, Sadat opened negotiations with Israel, resulting most notably in the Camp David Accords brokered by President Jimmy Carter and made peace with Israel in a historic peace treaty in 1979.Adfi Safty, \\"Sadat's Negotiations with the United States and Israel: From Sinai to Camp David,\\" American Journal of Economics & Sociology, July 1991, 50#3 pp 285‚Äì298 Sadat's domestic policy, called 'Infitah,' was aimed at modernizing the economy and removing Nasser's heavy-handed controls. Sadat realized American aid was essential to that goal, and it allowed him to disengage from the Israeli conflict, and to pursue a regional peace policy.Mannin G. Weinbaum, \\"Egypt's 'Infitah' and the Politics of US Economic Assistance,\\" Middle Eastern Studies, March 1985, Vol. 21 Issue 2, pp 206‚Äì222 =Military cooperation= Following the peace treaty with Israel, between 1979 and 2003, Egypt acquired about $19 billion in military aid, making Egypt the second largest non-NATO recipient of U.S. military aid after Israel. Also, Egypt received about $30 billion in economic aid within the same time frame. In 2009, the U.S. provided a military assistance of US$1.3 billion (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ), and an economic assistance of US$250 million (inflation adjusted US$ million in ). In 1989 both Egypt and Israel became a Major non-NATO ally of the United States. Military cooperation between the U.S. and Egypt is probably the strongest aspect of their strategic partnership. General Anthony Zinni, the former Commandant of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), once said, \\"Egypt is the most important country in my area of responsibility because of the access it gives me to the region.\\" Egypt was also described during the Clinton Administration as the most prominent player in the Arab world and a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. U.S. military assistance to Egypt was considered part of the administration's strategy to maintaining continued availability of Persian Gulf energy resources and to secure the Suez Canal, which serves both as an important international oil route and a critical route for U.S. warships transiting between the Mediterranean and either the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf. US President George W. Bush with President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak at Camp David in 2002. Egyptian President Mubarak with US President Barack Obama in Cairo, Egypt, 4 June 2009. Egypt is the strongest military power on the African continent, and according to Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies' annual Middle East Strategic Balance, the largest in the Middle East =Counterterrorism= Despite differences and periods of friction in relations between the two countries, the U.S.‚ÄìEgyptian relations under Mubarak had evolved, moving beyond the Middle East peace process towards an independent bilateral friendship. It was in the U.S. interest that Egypt was able to present moderate voice in Arab councils and persuade other Arab states to join the peace process and to normalize their relations with the U.S. However lately Egyptian‚ÄìAmerican relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the U.S. in its war against international terrorism after the September 11th attacks of 2001 but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed U.S. military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq through their membership in the African Union and the Arab League, continued to oppose U.S. occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with U.S. requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella. The issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole. Opponents say that the war was illegal and it is necessary to wait until Iraq has legal representative government to deal with it. On the other hand, supporters of participation argued that the responsibility to protect Iraqis and to help them in time of crisis should prevail and guide the Egyptian action in Iraq, despite the fact that the Iraqis do not agree. As of 2011, US officials quoted in USA Today described Egyptian security and military as having shared \\"valuable intelligence\\" and providing other \\"useful counterterrorism assistance\\", in the 1980, 90s and \\"particularly in the decade since the 9/11 attacks\\". Under President Hosni Mubarak and his intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, the U.S. has had \\"an important partnership\\" in counterterrorism. When the U.S. made cuts in military aid to Egypt following the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi and crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood movement, it continued funding for counterterrorism, border security and security operations in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, considered very important to Israel's security. 2011 Egyptian revolution and aftermath U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with Egyptian President Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo on April 20, 2016 During the 2011 Egyptian revolution top US government officials urged Hosni Mubarak and his government to reform, to refrain from using violence and to respect the rights of protesters such as the right to peaceful assembly and association. Ties between the two countries became strained after Egyptian soldiers and police raided 17 offices of local and foreign NGOs‚Äîincluding the International Republican Institute (IRI), the National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and the German Konrad-Adenauer Foundation on December 29, 2011 because of allegations of illegal funding from abroad. The United States condemned the raids as an attack on democratic values and threatened to stop the $1.3bn in military aid and about $250m in economic aid Washington gives Egypt every year, but this threat was dismissed by the Egyptian government. 43 NGO members including Sam LaHood, son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and Nancy Okail, then resident director of U.S.-based NGO Freedom House's operations in Egypt, were charged with obtaining international funds illegally and failing to register with the Egyptian government. After an appeal by those charged, the case had been switched from a criminal court to one handling misdemeanours, where the maximum penalty was a fine and not imprisonment. After lifting a travel ban on 17 foreign NGO members, among them 9 Americans, the United States and Egypt began to repair their relations. Nevertheless, on September 11, 2012, (the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks) Egyptian protesters stormed the US embassy in Cairo, tore down the American flag and replaced it with a flag with Islamic symbols, to mock the Americans after an anti-Islamic movie denigrating the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, was shot in the United States and released on the internet. In November 2012, Barack Obama‚Äîfor the first time since Egypt signed the peace treaty with Israel‚Äîdeclared that the United States does not consider Egypt's Islamist-led government an ally or an enemy. In another incident, General Martin Dempsey said that the U.S.‚ÄìEgypt military ties will depend on Egypt's actions towards Israel. He said in June 2012; \\"The Egyptian leaders will salute a civilian president for the first time ‚Ä¶ and then they'll go back to barracks. But I don't think it's going to be as clean as that. That's why we want to stay engaged with them ‚Ä¶ not [to] shape or influence, but simply be there as a partner to help them understand their new responsibilities\\". President Donald Trump greets the President of Egypt, Abd El-Fattah El-Sisi, May 2017 Ties between the two countries have temporarily soured since the overthrow of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi on July 3, 2013, which followed a massive uprising against Morsi. The Obama administration denounced Egyptian attempts to combat the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters, cancelling future military exercises and halting the delivery of F-16 jet fighters and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to the Egyptian Armed Forces. Popular sentiment among secular Egyptians towards the United States has been negatively affected by conspiracy theories which claim that the U.S. assisted the unpopular Muslim Brotherhood in attaining power ‚Äîas well as the Obama administration's policy of tolerance toward the Muslim Brotherhood and the past presidency of Morsi. However, in a 2014 news story, the BBC reported that \\"the US has revealed it has released $575 million (¬£338m) in military aid to Egypt that had been frozen since the ousting of President Mohammed Morsi last year.\\"\\"US unlocks military aid to Egypt, backing President Sisi\\".

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the United Nations condemned Trump's comment, describing it as \\"racist\\". President Salvador Sanchez Ceren said that he \\"vigorously rejected\\" the comments that were attributed to Trump. Present U.S.-Salvadoran relations remain close and strong.

El Salvador has been a committed member of the coalition of nations fighting against terrorism and has sent 10 rotations of troops to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. U.S. ties to El Salvador are dynamic and growing. More than 19,000 American citizens live and work full-time in El Salvador. Most are private businesspersons and their families, but a small number of American citizen retirees have been drawn to El Salvador by favorable tax conditions. However, following the Salvadoran government's controversial decision to cut ties with Taiwan in favor of the People's Republic of China in August 2019, some Republican senators like Marco Rubio had demanded that economical aid to the country be cut and their expulsion from Alianza Para Prosperidad (a U.S-supported program to help El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala with education and healthcare to reduce illegal immigration to the United States).

Natalie E. Brown is the current U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea.  History  The U.S. government (USG) established a consulate in Asmara in 1942. In 1953, the USG signed a Mutual Defense Treaty with Ethiopia. The treaty granted the United States control and expansion of the important British military communications base at Kagnew near Asmara. In the 1960s, as many as 1,700 U.S. military personnel were stationed at Kagnew. In the 1970s, technological advances in the satellite and communications fields were making the communications station at Kagnew increasingly obsolete. Embassy of Eritrea in Washington, D.C. In 1974, Kagnew Station drastically reduced its personnel complement. In early 1977, the United States informed the Ethiopian government that it intended to close Kagnew Station permanently by September 30, 1977. In the meantime, U.S. relations with the Mengistu regime worsened. In April 1977, Mengistu abrogated the 1953 mutual defense treaty and ordered a reduction of U.S. personnel in Ethiopia, including the closure of Kagnew Communications Center and the consulate in Asmara. In August 1992, the United States reopened its consulate in Asmara, staffed with one officer. On April 27, 1993, the United States recognized Eritrea as an independent state, and on June 11, diplomatic relations were established with the appointment of a charg√© d'affaires. The first U.S. Ambassador arrived later that year. U.S. interests in Eritrea include consolidating the peace with Ethiopia, encouraging progress toward establishing a democratic political culture, supporting Eritrean efforts to become constructively involved in solving regional problems, and promoting economic reform. The U.S. Embassy is in Asmara. Steven Walker has been Charg√© d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Asmara, Eritrea, since December 2019.

While often known in the West by renditions of his Chinese name, the three Chinese characters that form his name are pronounced K≈ç Bunya () in Japanese, and thus he is also known as Koh Bunya in the West. In his compositions, which range from for piano to choral and orchestral works, he merged elements of traditional Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese music with modernist influences. Due to the political turmoil surrounding his life, he came to be largely forgotten during the latter part of his life. After his death, however, his work has started to gain new recognition in East Asia as well as in the West. Biography Chiang was born in 1910 to Chinese parents in Tamsui, Taiwan ‚Äì a Japanese territory at the time, and so his nationality was Japanese from birth. He is of Yongding, Fujian Hakka ancestry. In 1923, he went to Ueda, a small town in the prefecture of Nagano, Japan, to attend secondary school. He later proceeded to the Tokyo Engineering and Commerce Advanced School (presently Musashi Institute of Technology) where his major was electrical engineering. At the same time he also started to attend evening classes at the Tokyo Music School (today part of the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music). Initially, he was active as a singer, and in 1932, discovered by his choir leader, he became a baritone singer for the Columbia Record Company. A few years later he would become a member of the Opera Company led by one of Japan's foremost opera singers, Yoshie Fujiwara. In 1933 he married his first wife, a Japanese woman. Around this time, he also started studying composition under prominent composers Kosaku Yamada and Kunihiko Hashimoto. Soon he started to earn laurels as a composer himself, and a breakthrough came in 1936 when he submitted the orchestral work Formosan Dance to the art competition of the Berlin Summer Olympics, which was honourably mentioned. Alexander Tcherepnin who was visiting China and Japan at the time recognized Chiang's talent and published his works in Europe, the United States, and China. In 1938, in the midst of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang was appointed professor of musical arts at the Teacher's College in Beijing, which was then under Japanese control. The Japanese government considered him a valuable tool to gain the appeal of the general public of both nations. In the ensuing years, he commuted between Beijing and Tokyo, where his family still resided. During this time, he was one of the most frequently played composers in Japan. However, that was to change as the Japanese surrender in 1945 deprived him of his Japanese nationality; he became a composer of the People's Republic of China, and his name soon vanished from the Japanese music scene. In Communist China, Chiang's cultural and political bonds to Japan and his aesthetic affinity with European modernism led him to be regarded as a traitor and a bourgeois. In order not to be expunged he was forced to recast his style of composition to comply with the more moderate taste of the government party. Events such as the Anti-Rightist Movement in the 1950s and early 1960s, and the Cultural Revolution in 1966 made him a political target. Some of his compositions, including three symphonies with opus numbers, seem to have disappeared in the midst of these charges. In 1978 his honor was finally restored. By that time, however, he was afflicted with disease, and he died in Beijing in 1983. Renewed interest Following his exoneration, Chiang is today gradually being rediscovered by a new generation of East Asians including audiences in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Japan. Chiang Wen-yeh was a theme of the 2003 Japanese film Caf√© Lumi√®re directed by Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, which tells the story of a young Japanese woman doing research on the composer. His work is featured on the soundtrack, and his Japanese wife and daughter make appearances as themselves. References Sources * Katayama, Motohide (2001).

It ran for two and a half years. Affiliated with Clear Channel Communications, National Lampoon Comedy Radio was first added to XM Satellite Radio, and began airing on the satellite radio service on October 1, 2006. Much of the programming was broadcast from National Lampoon World Headquarters in West Hollywood, California. The station had pre-recorded, mock-live comedy talk shows with hosts Nadine Rajabi \\"Nadine @ Nite\\", Kevin Couch, and Phil Iazzetta broadcasting five days a week. The programing was built around stand-up performances from famous comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld, Robin Williams, George Carlin, D. L. Hughley, and Bob Saget. The station also played prank calls from Crank Yankers and other sources, parody songs (labeled \\"Poon Tunes\\"), and interviews with active comedians (Marc Maron, Larry The Cable Guy, Dave Attell, and many more). Behind the scenes, the XM network was created and run out of two small, adjoining offices in a building on Sunset Blvd. The programing, while seeming live to the listener, was pre-recorded and uploaded to an XM server each day. While on the air, the station was funded by Kent Emmons and supported by a staff of Tre Giles, David Frederic, Eugene Chin, Kevin Couch, Phil Iazzetta, Nadine Rajabi, Eric Cahill, and Jason Sharp. Funding for the network was pulled in May 2008, when it was deemed unprofitable (despite having not employed anyone to sell ads). The XM feed continued to air existing content until the following year. As of March 6, 2009, National Lampoon radio was dropped from the Sirius-XM line-up, replaced by talk programming. =Television= Originally formed in 2002, the National Lampoon College Network was a block of weekly television programming broadcast to colleges and universities.

An embassy in Tallinn was opened on June 30th 1930 with Harry E. Carlson as Charg√© d'affaires. Following the Soviet occupation in August 1940 the American Embassy was closed in September 1940. However, the US government never recognized the legitimacy of the Soviet Rule in Estonia (1940 to 1991) and continued recognizing Estonia's diplomatic mission in the US as the legal representative of the Republic of Estonia.

The rule includes a uniform \\"locate\\" requirement for short sales in all equity securities and a requirement for the firms to document what they have done to locate the securities.

The United States rebuffed Ethiopia's request for increased military assistance to intensify its fight against the Eritrean secessionist movement and to repel the Somali invasion. The International Security and Development Act of 1985 prohibited all U.S. economic assistance to Ethiopia with the exception of humanitarian disaster and emergency relief. In July 1980, the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia was recalled at the request of the Ethiopian Government (who was then Frederic L. Chapin), and the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Embassy in the United States were headed subsequently by Charges d'Affaires.Ethiopia:US-Ethiopia relations, United States State Department website (accessed 19 December 2010) =Post-Mengistu regime= With the downfall of Mengistu Haile Mariam (who had taken control of the Derg), U.S.-Ethiopian relations improved as legislative restrictions on non- humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia were lifted. Diplomatic relations were upgraded to the ambassadorial level in 1992. Total U.S. government assistance, including food aid, between 1991 and 2003 was $2.3 billion. During the severe drought year of 2003, the U.S. provided a record $553.1 million in assistance, of which $471.7 million was food aid. Twenty-first century relations =U.S. Congress legislation= The U.S. Congress, however, attempted to set conditions, over the objections of the Bush Administration. In October, 2007, the House of Representatives passed the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007, banning military aid, for other than counter-terror and peacekeeping unless Ethiopia improved its human rights record. H.R. 2003 was referred to the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, but was not voted on. The bill sought to restrict U.S. military aid for any purpose other than counter- terrorism and peacekeeping purposes. If the President certified that all political prisoners had been released and an independent media could function without excessive interference, full, normal military aid could resume. The Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act would have restricted security assistance and imposed travel restrictions on Ethiopian officials accused of human rights violations unless Ethiopia met the conditions ‚Äì although the legislation would have given the president a waiver to prevent such measures from taking force. The Act also exempted counter-terrorism, peacekeeping operations and international military training from any funding restrictions, a reflection of Ethiopia‚Äôs military capabilities and its perceived role as a source of stability in the volatile Horn of Africa. In 2006, the Ethiopian government hired law firm DLA Piper to lobby against the passage of the H.R. 2003. The Ethiopian government was specifically concerned about the sanctions that would be enacted if the bill passed. DLA Piper, on behalf of the Ethiopian government, released statements emphasizing the counterterrorism role that the country played in the region, and that the United States relied on. Additionally, Ethiopian diaspora groups, in opposition to the Ethiopian government, hired Bracewell and Giuliani to lobby for the passage of H.R. 2003. When asked about H.R. 2003, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated that, \\"The administration does not support this particular house resolution.\\" The Bush administration believed that human rights violations in Ethiopia needed to be addressed, but it claimed that H.R. 2003 was the not the best method to do so. Instead, Secretary Rice announced that the administration was working with NGOs to improve the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia, and that a good relationship with the Ethiopian government was essential for the efficacy of those programs. = Global War on Terror = Ethiopia is an important country to the United States in the Global War on Terrorism. The Pentagon needs Ethiopia and its intelligence service to counter the influence of Al-Qaeda fighters in the neighbouring Somalia. The CIA allegedly used Ethiopia as a base for black sites to secretly interrogate undeclared prisoners in the Global War on Terrorism.\\"‚ÄòOutsourced Guantanamo‚Äô‚ÄìFBI & CIA Interrogating Detainees in Secret Ethiopian Jails, U.S. Citizen Among Those Held\\", Democracy Now!, April 5, 2007 = Human rights violations = Human rights groups have accused the United States of giving Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi \\"a free rein\\" to abuse his own people. In April 2010, Human Rights Watch published a report which accused Zenawi's ruling party Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front of having \\"total control of local and district administrators to monitor and intimidate individuals at household level.\\" The report author Ben Rawlence also said that \\"Meles is using aid to build a one-party state\\" and accused foreign governments of having colluded in eroding civil liberties and democracy by letting their aid be manipulated by Zenawi. The Ethiopian government has denounced the report as \\"outrageous\\". Human rights violations in Ethiopia have created a strain in the two countries' relations. Jendayi Frazer, head of U.S. African policy as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs at the Bureau of African Affairs, spoke of \\"unprecedented\\" agreements between the Ethiopian opposition and government, which she said were \\"a monumental advancement in the political environment\\". Examples she gave included reform of the National Election Board of Ethiopia and a new code of conduct for the press. But she added that the U.S. had raised \\"strong concerns\\" about human rights violations. In April 2010, Ethiopia attempted to jam broadcasts of the Voice of America, the U.S. state-run broadcaster. Prime Minister Zenawi accused Voice of America of broadcasting ethnic hatred and compared the broadcaster to the hate speech from Radio Mille Collines, which had helped provoke genocide in Rwanda. The Economist pointed out that the U.S. response to these accusations had been rather muted, probably due to the importance of the U.S.-Ethiopia alliance. During the outbreak of the 2016 Ethiopian protests the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa released a statement in which it said the U.S. government was ‚Äúdeeply concerned with the extensive violence.‚ÄùSeveral dozen shot dead in weekend protests across Ethiopia, 8 Aug. 2016, Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/several-dozen-fatally-shot-in-weekend- protests-across- ethiopia/2016/08/08/e03956d6-5d96-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html =African integration= Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and President Obama at the White House in 2014 Barack Obama was the first sitting United States president to speak in front of the African Union in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, on 29 July 2015. With his speech, he encouraged the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure and the economy. But he also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step off, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities) and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly increase living quality for Africans.

The musical had a script by David Cerda with music and lyrics by Cerda, Scott Lamberty and Taylor E. Ross. The musical spoof played in two different productions in Illinois. The musical uses a 1970s influenced score and \\"lots of pigs blood\\". Production history Scarrie was originally staged by Sweetback Productions entitled s'Carrie as a late night's show at the Sweetcorn Playhouse in Anderson, Illinois. Featuring a male only cast, the show ran for over a year and a half and closed when Sweetcorn Playhouse closed down. In 2005, a new production previewed July 1, 2005 and opened the following day, receiving mixed reviews and closed on August 2, 2005 after 22 performances at the Theatre Building in Chicago. The show was amended and re-staged in 2005 from Cerda's own company Hell in a Handbag Productions. This new production featured revisions of old songs as well as an additional ten tracks. The production was produced by Jackie Anderson and directed by Margot Bordelon.http://carriefansite.blogspot.com/2007/06/about-scarrie.html The show featured Joey Steakley as Carrie and Ed Jones as Margaret. The production also featured Trista Smith as Miss Collins, Veronica Sheaffer as Sue, Robyn Senchak as Chris, Ryan Lanning as Tommy and Tim Howard as Billy.

It plans to run until November 10. The production is set to feature music from both the original and the 2005 production, as well as some new editions to the script and score. The revival will star Alex Grelle as Carrie, Danni Smith as Margaret White, Steve Love as Sue Snell and Aubrey Stanton as Chris Hargenson. Ed Jones (2005's Margaret White) will play Miss Collins, AJ Wright will play Tommy Ross, and David Lipschutz will be Billy Nolan. As a treat to Handbag fans, writer David Cerda will be featured in the production as well. The rest of the cast takes a traditional turn, in that all of Carrie's other classmates are played by females. The production will be Directed by Cheryl Snodgrass, with musical direction by Josh Walker and Choreography by Kristen Smiley.

He is now considered to be the author of the Compendium theologiae or Compendium theologicae veritatis. On account of its scope and style, as well as its practical arrangement, it was for 400 years used as a textbook.St Dominic and the OP 3 It may have been the most widely read theological work of the later Middle Ages, in western Europe.G. H. Gerrits, Inter Timorem Et Spem: A Study of the Theological Thought of Gerard Zerbolt (1986), p. 23. In 1232 a sale of land to Hugo von Ripelin, then the paddock prior of the Dominican Predigerkloster in Z√ºrich, is mentioned.Walter Baumann: Z√ºrichs Kirchen, Kl√∂ster und Kapellen bis zur Reformation. Verlag Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Z√ºrich 1994, The Compendium By reason of its extensive use and wide circulation it was often copied and later more often printed and reprinted. The work consists of seven books which treat of the Creation, the Fall, the Incarnation, Grace, the Sacraments, and the Last Four Things. In the entire medieval literature there is probably no work whose composition has in the past been attributed to so many different authors. It is now dated to 1268.Jacques Le Goff, The Birth of Purgatory (English translation 1984), p. 264. The incunabula of Venice, Lyons, Strasbourg, Ulm, and Nuremberg enumerated by Ludwig HainRepertorium bibliographicum are without the author's name. Some attribute it to the Dominican Ulrich of Strasburg. Bach in the Kirchenlexicon (I, 427) make Albert of Strasburg the author, but recent researches go to show that such a person never existed. Thomas Dorinberg, who supplied the edition of 1473 with an index, was for a long time looked upon as the author; others attributed it to Thomas Aquinas. In the magnificent edition of Lyons (1557), furnished with notes and index by the Franciscan John of Combes, it is credited to the Dominican Albert the Great and is placed in the folio edition of the latter's works published at Lyons (1651). Again, some held Bonaventure to be its author, with the result that the Compendium found a place in the appendix of the eighth volume of his works (Rome, 1588‚Äì96). Among other theologians to whom it was ascribed are Hugh of Saint Cher, Alexander of Hales, Aureolus, the Oxford Dominican Thomas of Sutton, Peter of Tarantasia and others. Other works The Compendium most probably, if not certainly, was written by Hugh of Stasburg. Other works attributed to him are: \\"Commentarium in IV libros sententiarum\\"; \\"Quodlibeta, quaestiones, disputationes et variae in divinos libros explanationes\\".

Wylde played as a striker, he was good in the air but had fine skill on the ground for a tall man. In his final few years in football he took a degree in physiotherapy and has been the physiotherapist for Stockport County since he retired in 1988.  Playing career  Rodger Wylde's career lasted from 1972 to 1989 during which time he played 370 English league games, scoring 139 goals. =Sheffield Wednesday= Roger Wylde joined Sheffield Wednesday as an apprentice straight from school in July 1971 and made his debut for the club on 18 November 1972 against Middlesbrough, he scored his first goal two weeks later on 2 December against Millwall. Wylde's opportunities at Hillsborough were limited until the appointment of Len Ashurst as manager in October 1975. In the 1976-77 season he was top scorer for the club with 25 goals in all competitions and formed a fine attacking partnership with Tommy Tynan, between them they netted 40 goals that season. Wylde continued to score goals regularly over the following two seasons and became a crowd favourite with Wednesday supporters who gave him the nickname \\"Oscar\\". Wylde's trademark celebration after scoring a goal was to go on his knees with arms aloft in front of the fans. The 1979-80 season saw Wylde not playing as regularly for the team as Terry Curran, Ian Mellor and Andy McCulloch became the main forwards during Wednesday's promotion that season from Division Three. He was sold by manager Jack Charlton midway through that season, with Wylde playing his final game on 16 February 1980 and moving to Oldham Athletic as a replacement for Vic Halom. =Oldham Athletic, Sporting CP, Sunderland= Wylde continued his good goalscoring form at Oldham finishing top scorer in each of his three full seasons there, in total scoring 51 league goals in 113 appearances. At the end of his contract with Oldham, Wylde moved abroad to play for top Portuguese side Sporting CP for the 1983-84 season. He was very much a fringe player with Sporting and his chances in the first team were limited. Wylde was brought back to the English game during the 1984-85 season by his old manager at Wednesday, Len Ashurst, who was now in charge at Sunderland and this gave Wylde his only opportunity to play top level football in England. He played 11 games that season for Sunderland scoring three goals including one against Liverpool at Anfield in 1-1 draw. =Barnsley, Stockport County= Rodger Wylde's last few seasons as a player were at Barnsley and Stockport County. He spent three seasons at Barnsley playing 52 league games scoring 19 goals. Part of the 1987-88 season saw him on loan at Rotherham United before joining Stockport where he spent one season (1988‚Äì89) on the playing staff, appearing in 26 games and scoring 12 goals.  Physiotherapist  In order to stay in football when he retired from playing Wylde started a physiotherapy degree course towards the end of his playing career. He graduated from the University of Salford.\\"Having a Ball\\", Times Higher Education, 24 November 1995 After qualifying he opened a treatment centre and gymnasium in Sheffield but when Danny Bergara became Stockport manager in March 1989 he offered Wylde the post of club physiotherapist. Wylde has now been physio at Stockport for 24 years, an unusually long time, serving under eleven different managers to date. In 2006, he was inducted into Stockport's Hall of Fame. After Stockport's promotion in 2008, Rodger got naked in the changing rooms at Wembley and said, \\"It's been a really.......good day\\" . Wylde left Stockport to become the 'Head of Sports Science and Medicine' at Chesterfield on 8 July 2014, replacing Jamie Hewitt.  Music  Rodger Wylde was always a big music fan especially of progressive rock. In 1998, he formed his own band Fracture along with Stockport player Tom Bennett, who was recovering from a severe break to his leg at the time. Both men decided to learn the guitar to brighten up the prolonged injury period, and a bassist and a drummer were added. After a period of nonperforming, Fracture were re-formed in April 2006 with Stockport's club doctor Steve Greenhough (keyboards and bass), David Prudhoe (lead guitar) and Keith Chadwick (drums) joining Rodger and Tom to complete the new line-up. They play regular concerts around the Greater Manchester area.

Watkins is the former CEO of Seagate Technology, the world's largest manufacturer of hard drives. Watkins was appointed as the company's CEO in 2004 and served in this position until January 2009. He was appointed as CEO of BridgeLux, an emerging solid state lighting company in Silicon Valley, in January 2010. Between June 2000 and July 2004, Watkins served as president and chief operating officer and was responsible for Seagate's global hard disk drive operations. He was elected to Seagate's board of directors in 2004. Watkins joined Seagate in 1996 as part of the company's merger with Conner Peripherals. While at Conner, he established the Conner Disk Division and managed its success through the merger with Seagate. Biography Watkins's early life was marked by frequent moves. His father, a field manager in the oil industry, relocated the family every five years, from Venezuela to Canada to Wyoming, eventually settling in Pampa, Texas (USA). After graduating from Pampa High School in 1971, Watkins enlisted in the Army as a medic, assisting injured Vietnam veterans at a Missouri base. After leaving the Army and graduating from the University of Texas, Watkins hitchhiked to California, where he landed a job at Xidex, a Silicon Valley floppy disk manufacturer. More senior-level jobs followed at Domain, a drive-component manufacturer, and Conner. When Seagate acquired Conner, then-CEO Al Shugart made Watkins responsible for the company's four drive factories. In an interview with Forbes magazine in 2006, Watkins recalled how the company's management culture rewarded those who \\"yelled the loudest\\" in meetings. Watkins was also frustrated by the fact that just 2 percent of Seagate's products shared common parts. He demanded the company's engineers design products that could be built using common components and machinery. The engineers started small, reducing the number of screws used in each product, and worked their way up to complex heads that write data onto the disks. Today, every one of Seagate's products can be manufactured on any of its line in any of its factories. Watkins's efficiency gains won him the job of chief operating officer in 1998. He currently serves on the board of directors of the Silicon Valley chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, along with the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. He also serves on the executive advisory council for IDEMA and the executive advisory board of the Juran Center for Leadership in Quality at the University of Minnesota. An avid adventure racer, Watkins created \\"Eco Seagate\\" in 2000, as a way to change the company's often-divisive culture. He wanted to instill a greater sense of teamwork and accountability throughout the company. Each year, 200 employees spend a week hiking, kayaking, mountain biking and rappelling in preparation for a grueling one-day race. Participants are divided into teams led by a member of Watkins's executive team. The group must complete the course together, by supporting their weakest members. Seagate spends $2 million for every event, which has been held in New Zealand, Australia and Hawaii over the years. Watkins says the event has helped build a more collaborative environment at Seagate. \\"It's all about the strength of the team,\\" Watkins said in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle in 2006. \\"You're always going to have team members who are weak. How do you work together to get through it? The whole idea is to get people relating to each other.\\" With his wife Denise, Watkins is the former owner of the Vancouver Stealth professional indoor lacrosse team, which won the National Lacrosse League championship in 2010. He ceased being the CEO of Seagate in early 2009 after company profits have all but disintegrated and the stock has plummeted about 80 percent over 2008, compared with 45 percent at archrival Western Digital and 40 percent for the broad market indices. The company has also lost market share in the hot notebook computer segment and is behind the innovation curve on up-and-coming solid state drives. He joined the Board of Directors of Vertical Circuits Inc. in March 2009. He is married with three children: Kelly, Casey, and Christopher.

The case is concerned with the question of \\"breaking the chain of causation\\", or novus actus interveniens. Facts Mr Baker (the plaintiff) was knocked down by the defendant's car, leaving him with a stiff ankle of his left leg and reduced mobility and income. After the accident but before the trial, Mr Baker was shot by a robber in his injured leg and the leg had to be amputated. The defendant argued that the injuries he had caused to Mr Baker were obviated by the later accident. His argument was based on causation: the shooting was an intervening event, which was not caused by his negligent driving and the amputation of the man's leg meant that the defendant could not be held accountable for any loss, since the damage he had done previously no longer existed. Judgement The House of Lords has unanimously rejected this argument. Lord Pearson held although this argument seemed to make logical sense, it would produce a \\"manifest injustice\\" if it were allowed to succeed. Lord Reid considered that the damage caused by the defendant, the plaintiff's inability to run, his reduced working capacities etc. were not obviated by the shooter's act. Furthermore, if the shooter (who could not be found), were to be held liable, he would only have to pay the losses he caused Mr Baker by the shooting, not by the earlier car accident (because of the rule that \\"the defendant must take the plaintiff as he finds him\\"). Consequently, Mr Baker would remain under compensated.

The United States had opposed Fiji's unelected government, which came to power through a military coup in December 2006. History = Before the 2006 coup = In response to attacks by locals on American merchants operating in Fiji, the U.S. Navy launched the First and Second Fiji Expeditions. These punitive expeditions were carried out in 1855 and 1859 respectively. Prior to Fiji becoming a British colony in 1874, the United States had maintained a consular presence there. The US recognized Fiji's independence in October 1970. Formal diplomatic relations, and the American Embassy at Suva, were established in 1971. On 2 March 2005, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase strongly reacted to a U.S. State Department report criticizing Fiji for practicing racial discrimination, and for the racial divide between Fiji's two main political parties, the SDL (mostly indigenous Fijian) and the Fiji Labour Party (mostly Indo-Fijian). \\"Fiji can make a similar report on the US on all those issues. Our report would be far worse than the US State Department's report on Fiji,\\" he said. He went on to rebuke the United States for interfering in Fiji's domestic affairs. In an interview with the Fiji Times on 29 May 2005, America's outgoing Ambassador David Lyons renewed his country's criticism of Fijian policies by criticizing the Qarase government's proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission. Lyons expressed concern that its provisions for amnesty for persons convicted of involvement in the coup d'etat that overthrew the elected government in 2000 would encourage further coups in the future. \\"If a democratic society doesn't make it clear that the violent over-throw of its elected leaders is a crime against that society, I have to think that it is inviting future upheaval,\\" he said. He also condemned statements of public figures predicting coups if they, their party, or their race is not successful in the next parliamentary election, saying that such threats were \\"absolutely despicable in a free, democratic society\\" and constituted \\"the worst form of scaremongering.\\" Lyons said that the amnesty for perpetrators of the 1987 coups had been an error of judgement and had set a precedent which could negatively affect the future unless stopped now. He concurred with statements made by a number of Fijian politicians, including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau, that a coup culture had taken root in Fiji. He warned that tourism, which forms the mainstay of the Fijian economy, would be adversely impacted by any further instability. He believed, he said, that the Qarase government was sincere in its commitment to democracy, and acknowledged positive steps taken by the government to restore the rule of law. He added a word of caution, however: \\"All of these positive steps ... will vanish in an instant if there is another coup or sufficient political upheaval questioning the legitimacy of future elections.\\" On 12 July, however, Lyons cautioned the Fijian military against using the legislation as a pretext for a coup d'√©tat. Their concern over the proposed law was understandable, he said, but it did warrant the overthrow of the government. \\"Extra constitutional action against a duly elected democratic government ... is unacceptable,\\" he said. A coup would be detrimental not only to Fiji, but to the entire Pacific region, Lyons said. = After the 2006 coup = The United States suspended $2.5 million in aid money pending a review of the situation, following the 2006 coup. The United States has not recognized the interim government established by the country's December 5, 2006 coup. Although the United States provides relatively little direct bilateral development assistance, it contributes as a major member of a number of multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the Pacific Community (SPC). The United States Peace Corps, temporarily withdrawn from Fiji in 1998, resumed its program in Fiji in late 2003. Fiji's response to its deteriorating relations with the United States and other Western countries has been to turn to Asia for new political and economic partners. In July 2007, Fiji's Interim Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry outlined his country's \\"Look North\\" foreign policy: :\\"Fiji has friends in China, it has friends in Korea, it has friends in [‚Ä¶] other Asian countries. We‚Äôre no longer relying on Australia and New Zealand. And in any event, the United States was not doing much for Fiji anyway.\\"\\"Chaudhry breaks silence to slag New Zealand\\", NiuFM, July 9, 2007 The previous month, Interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama, the author of the 2006 coup, had called upon the international community to normalise its relations with Fiji, following his pledge to restore democracy by 2009. In December 2007, one year after the coup, Fiji's embassy in Washington stated that it wished to promote \\"good relations between Fiji and the United States of America\\".\\"Embassy Works to Cultivate Good Relations Between the US and Fiji\\" , Fiji embassy in the United States, December 21, 2007 In May 2008, the United States embassy in Suva issued the following statement: \\"The United States continues to condemn the military coup and the Interim Government‚Äôs actions to suppress the freedom of speech of those in the media.\\"\\"United States Strong Concern About Hannah expulsion\\" , US embassy in Fiji, May 2, 2008 In October, Fiji's High Court ruled that the interim government was not illegal, as it had been appointed by the President, who had acted within the lawful provisions of his authority. Following the ruling, Fiji‚Äôs interim attorney-general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, called upon Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and the United States to lift the sanctions they had imposed on the country, stating that they could no longer refuse to recognise the interim government. The United States government responded that it did not intend to alter its position, and that the \\"suspension of certain US assistance to the Fiji government under section 508 of the foreign operations appropriations act will remain in place, until the President or Secretary of State determines that Fiji has made measurable progress toward the restoration of democratic rule\\".\\"US reaffirms it's (sic) stand for Fiji\\" , Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, October 10, 2008 In April 2009, however, the Fiji High Court of Appeals overruled the original decision, stating instead that Bainimarama's coup was in fact unconstitutional and his post-coup regime is an illegal government. The court called for the Commander to step down and asked the President to appoint a new, interim prime minister caretaker (that was to be neither Commodore Bainimarama nor the former prime minister Qarase whom he overthrew) who would be in power until new elections could be held.\\"Fiji court rules Bainimarama coup illegal\\", Courier Mail, 9 April 2009 The President responded by abrogating the constitution and illegally removing the judges and thereby, Fiji's judicial system as a whole. Bainimarama's government remains unrecognized by Australia, New Zealand, the EU, and the U.S. among others. In May, Fiji became the first nation to be removed from the Pacific Islands Forum for human rights abuses\\"Pacific Islands Forum suspends Fiji\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 2 May 2009 and is currently in danger of being removed from the Commonwealth as well.  Diplomatic missions  The U.S. Embassy in Fiji is located in Suva. Fiji maintains an embassy in Washington DC, as well as a Permanent Mission in New York City at the United Nations.

The salt often has a pinkish tint due to mineral impurities. It is primarily used as a food additive as table salt, but is also used as a material for cooking and food presentation, decorative lamps, and spa treatments. The salt is promoted with claims that it benefits health, but these claims lack any scientific basis.  Geology Himalayan salt Himalayan salt is mined from the Salt Range mountains, the southern edge of a fold-and-thrust belt that underlies the Pothohar Plateau south of the Himalayas. Himalayan salt comes from a thick layer of Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites of the Salt Range Formation. This geological formation consists of crystalline halite intercalated with potash salts, overlayed by gypsiferous marl and interlayered with beds of gypsum and dolomite with infrequent seams of oil shale that accumulated between 600 and 540 million years ago. These strata and the overlying Cambrian to Eocene sedimentary rocks were thrust southward over younger sedimentary rocks, and eroded to create the Salt Range.Jaum√©, S.C. and Lillie, R.J., 1988.

Macrostructures vs microstructures in evaporite detachments: An example from the Salt Range, Pakistan. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, 113, pp.922-934. History Local legend traces the discovery of the Himalayan salt deposits to the army of Alexander the Great. However, the first records of mining are from the Janjua people in the 1200s. Salt is mostly mined at the Khewra Salt Mine in Khewra, Jhelum District, Punjab, Pakistan, which is situated in the foothills of the Salt Range hill system in the Punjab province of the Pakistan to the Indo- Gangetic Plain. It is primarily exported in bulk, and processed in other countries for the consumer market. Mineral composition Himalayan salt crystals Himalayan salt is chemically similar to table salt. Analysis of a range of Khewra salt samples showed them to be between 96% and 99% sodium chloride, with varying amounts of trace minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, chromium, magnesium and sulfate, all at safe levels below 1%. Some salts mined in Pakistan are not suitable for food or industrial use without purification due to impurities. Some salt crystals from this region have an off-white to transparent color, while impurities in some veins of salt give it a pink, reddish, or beet-red color. Nutritionally, Himalayan salt is also similar to common table salt, though it lacks the beneficial iodine that is added to commercial iodised table salt. Uses Salt lamp Himalayan salt is used to flavor food. Due mainly to marketing costs, pink Himalayan salt is up to 20 times more expensive than table salt or sea salt. The impurities giving it its distinctive pink hue have given rise to the belief that it is healthier than common table salt. There is no scientific basis for such claimed health benefits. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration warned a manufacturer of dietary supplements, including one consisting of Himalayan salt, to discontinue marketing the products using unproven claims of health benefits. Slabs of salt are used as serving dishes, baking stones, and griddles, and it is also used to make tequila shot glasses. In such uses, small amounts of salt transfer to the food or drink and alter its flavor profile. Himalayan salt is also used to make \\"salt lamps\\", illuminated hollowed out blocks which radiate a pinkish or orangish hue. Claims that their use results in the release of ions that benefit health are without foundation. Similar scientifically-unsupported claims underlie use of Himalayan salt to line the walls of spas, along with its use for salt-inhalation spa treatments.

According to the Tennessee Blue Book,Tennessee Blue Book the Library and Archives \\"collects and preserves books and records of historical, documentary and reference value, and encourages and promotes library development throughout the state.\\" This mandate can be found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 10, Chapters 1-8. Although most states operate their libraries and archives as separate agencies, Tennessee is one of a handful of states whose library and archives are administered jointly.  History  The state library's original home (after a short stint in the Davidson County courthouse) was in the capitol building, while the archives were formerly housed in the basement of the state's War Memorial Building. The current Library and Archives Building, designed by H. Clinton Parrent Jr. and opened in 1953, sits across the street from the Tennessee State Capitol in downtown Nashville. Built as a memorial to all veterans of World War II, the Library and Archives building was constructed at a cost of $2.3 million. Tennessee's General Assembly joined the Department of Archives and History with the State Library in 1919 to create the State Library and Archives.  Library for Accessible Books and Media (LABM)  In 1970, a new division of TSLA, the Tennessee Library for the Blind & Physically Handicapped (LBPH) was established. On March 9, 2018, the LBPH changed its name to the Tennessee Library for Accessible Books and Media (LABM). This division's collections consist of public library type books and magazines in audio, braille and large print formats, as well as players for the audio books. The LABM's collections are loaned to Tennesseans who have physical disabilities which prevent them from using standard print. The materials are delivered to the individual patron's home address utilizing the U.S. Postal Service's \\"Free Matter\\" mailing privilege. Disabilities which make a Tennessee resident eligible to use the service are: blindness; visual disability; manual dexterity problems, which prevent holding a book and/or turning pages; and reading disabilities. The Tennessee LABM is a cooperating library with the National Library Service for the Blind & Physically HandicappedNational Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped/Library of Congress.  Holdings and collection highlights  The Tennessee State Library and Archives currently holds nearly 700,000 print volumes, over a million photographic images, thousands of vertical files, microfilm reels, and legislative audiocassettes. Archives and manuscripts collections are housed in nearly of storage. The Library for Accessible Books and Media holds approximately 240,000 items. TSLA holds the most comprehensive collection of Tennessee newspapers, which dates to 1791.  Future planning  Plans are currently underway for the Library and Archives to relocate to a new building adjacent to Nashville's Bicentennial Mall State Park. The new building, to be designed by Tuck Hinton Architects, PLC-Thomas, Miller & Partners, LLC Joint Venture (THA-TMP JV), will be one of several cultural institutions flanking the Bicentennial Mall, including the Tennessee State Museum and the Museum of African-American History and Culture.

Because of its high spatial resolution and ability to noninvasively visualize internal organs, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is widely believed to be an ideal platform for in vivo molecular imaging.Rodriguez I, Perez-Rial S, Gonzalez- Jiminez J, et al., Magnetic Resonance Methods and Applications in Pharmaceutical Research. J Pharma Sci, 28 Jan. 2008 (E-publication ahead of print) For this reason, MR contrast agents that can detect molecular events are an active field of research.Meade TJ, Taylor AK, and Bull SR, New magnetic resonance contrast agents as biochemical reporters. Curr Opin Neurobiol 13, pp. 597-602. One group of compounds that has shown particular promise is enzyme-activated MR contrast agents. Enzyme-activated MR contrast agents are compounds that cause a detectable change in image intensity when in the presence of the active form of a certain enzyme. This makes them useful for in vivo assays of enzyme activity. They are distinguished from current, clinical MR contrast agents that give only anatomical information,Welssleder R, and Umar M, Molecular Imaging. Radiology 219, pp. 316-333. such as aqueous gadolinium compounds, by their ability to make molecular processes visible. Enzyme-activated contrast agents are powerful tools for molecular imaging. To date, Œ≤-galactosidase-activated contrast agents have attracted the most attention in the literature, although there no theoretical reason that other enzymes could not be used to activate contrast agents. Also, mechanisms other than enzyme activation, such as Ca2+-dependent activation, can theoretically be used. In general, enzyme-activated agents contain a paramagnetic metal ion which can affect the T1 or T2 relaxation times for nearby water molecules. However, the metal ions are unable to interact with the water until an enzyme- catalyzed reaction takes place. Steric hindrance or coordination with other ions prevents water from accessing the paramagnetic center prior to the enzymatic reaction.Urbanczyk-Pearson LM, Femia FJ, Smith J, et al., Mechanistic Investigation of Œ≤-Galactosidase-Activated MR Contrast Agents. Inorg Chem 48, pp. 56-68  Structure of Œ≤-galactosidase-activated contrast agents  The Œ±-series of Œ≤-galactosidase-activated MR contrast agents. Prior to cleavage, the sugar blocks water from accessing the gadolinium ion. The active enzyme will cleave the sugar, allowing water to interact with the paramagnetic center. Two distinct Œ≤-galactosidase-activated contrast agents have been reported. Both consist of a Gd(III) ion complexed with a tetraazamacrocycle. At the N-10 position, a two-carbon chain links the gadolinium-tertaazamacrocycle complex to a molecule of galactose. The galactose is linked to the complex by a Œ≤-glycosidic bond at its C-1 position. The two forms of the contrast agent differ only in the location of a single methyl group. The first class, known as the Œ±-series, has a methyl group bound to the carbon that is Œ± to the tetraazamacrocycle. The other class, called the Œ≤-series, has a methyl attached to the Œ≤ carbon relative to the tetraazamacrocycle. The position of this methyl group is significant for the structure of the agent, and thus determines the mechanism by which the non- active compound shields the Gd(III) ion from interacting with water. The Œ±-series adopts a conformation in which the sugar lies directly over the paramagnetic center, thus sterically prohibitting water from accessing the gadolinium. The Œ≤-series, on the other hand, blocks water from the gadolinium by coordinating with a carbonate ion. There is no evidence that the stereochemical orientation of the methyl-bearing carbon affects the either the enzyme-catalyzed cleavage or the ability of the sugar to exclude water from the gadolinium ion. Studies have shown that the Œ±-series is far more effective at blocking water from the paramagnetic center prior to cleavage. The need to coordinate with a carbonate ion and the lower level of signal suppression inherent to the Œ≤-series make the Œ±-series a better candidate for use in research and clinical medicine.  Mechanism of activation  The Œ≤-galactosidase-catalyzed reaction that activates the contrast agent. In a tissue where active Œ≤-galactosidase is present, the sugar will be cleaved from the rest of the compound. This permits water to access the paramagnetic center, and causes the magnetic relaxation properties of the surrounding water molecules to change. This change in relaxation times will, in turn, visibly alter the signal intensity of images of the tissue obtained from MR scans. The mechanism proceeds in the same manner as all other Œ≤-galactosidase-catalyzed cleavages. The carboxyl group on a glutamic acid side chain within the enzyme acts as an acid catalyst, hastening the cleavage of the glycosidic bond at the C-1 position in the sugar. This cleavage gives water access to the paramagnetic center. The result of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is a free galactose molecule and an activated contrast agent.  Uses  There are obvious potential uses to this technology, both in research and clinical medicine. = Basic research = In a research context, the Œ±-series of Œ≤-galactosidase-activated MR contrast agents has been used to visualize the development and gene expression of cells in a Xenopus laevis embryo.Louie AY, Huber MM, Ahrens ET, et al., In vivo visualization of gene expression using magnetic resonance imaging. Nature Biotech 18, pp. 321-25 Researchers injected the agent into both cells of a two-cell stage embryo, and then injected only one of the cells with mRNA for the enzyme. Following a period of growth, they obtained MR images of the embryo that clearly displayed signal enhancement only in the cells derived from the parent cell that had been injected with both the enzyme and the contrast agent. This study demonstrates the value of whole body, in vivo molecular imaging methods for basic research. Such techniques permit scientists to test for gene activity and enzyme function throughout an organism. In contrast, many existing assays (such as fixation of cells on paraffin wax followed by immunostaining) only permit the analysis of a few cells at a time. These methods kill the cells, thus making time-series studies difficult. They also require the researcher to have identified a tissue of interest before obtaining the cells. The rise of whole-body molecular imaging methods may permit scientists to see where in an organism an enzyme is active without damaging cells; imaging could be repeated at multiple time points to monitor changes in gene expression or enzyme activity. Similar techniques have attracted considerable interest from researchers studying cancer and cardiovascular disease.Aikawa E, Nahrendorf M, Figueiredo JL, et al., Osteogenesis associates with inflammation in early-stage atherosclerosis evaluated by molecular imaging in vivo. Circulation 116, pp. 2841-50. = Clinical medicine = The ability to detect tissues that contain the active form of an enzyme at certain time has clear value in medicine. Specific contrast agents that provide enhancement only in the presence of active enzymes could allow doctors to conclusively and noninvasively assay for a wide variety of enzymatic diseases, such as fructose bisphosphatase deficiency. However, such diagnostic tools would require the development of contrast agents specific to the enzyme of interest, and would necessitate the development of methods for delivering the agents to cells (see ‚ÄúLimitations‚Äù below).  Limitations  Once the contrast agent has been activated by cleavage of the sugar group, the signal enhancing effects will only diminish if the gadolinium is washed out of the compartment containing it, or if water‚Äôs access to the metal group is again inhibited. So, to prevent permanent enhancement of the MR signal, cells must either have a way to export the gadolinium group to the bloodstream, or they must be able to replace the cleaved sugar group. There is no data in the literature indicating that either approach is feasible in vivo, suggesting that these methods may result in permanent signal amplification. Another challenge is the delivery of the contrast agents to target cells. In the sole paper describing in vivo use of enzyme-activated MR contrast agents, the agent was delivered to embryonic cells via a micropipette. However, the authors of the paper acknowledge that this is not a feasible approach for many research projects, and it presents a clear impediment to clinical use. There is active research in using the cell‚Äôs native import machinery to load contrast agents.Kayyem JF, Kumar RM, Fraser SE, et al., Receptor-targeted co-transport of DNA and magnetic resonance contrast agents.

It is part of the Tlacolula District in the east of the Valles Centrales Region. The city is the main commercial center for the Tlacolula Valley area, and best known for its weekly open air market held on Sundays. This market is one of the oldest, largest and busiest in Oaxaca, mostly selling foodstuffs and other necessities for the many rural people which come into town on this day to shop. The city is also home to a 16th-century Dominican church, whose chapel, the Capilla del Se√±or de Tlacolula, is known for its ornate Baroque decoration and a crucifix to which have been ascribed many miracles. Outside the city proper, the municipality is home to the Yagul archeological site.Yagul at INAH and a number of a group of one hundred caves and rock shelters which document the pre-historic transition of people from hunting and gathering to agriculture based on the domestication of corn and other plants. The name most likely comes from the Nahuatl phrase tlacolullan, which means \\"place of abundance.\\" However, some trace the origin to the Nahuatl phrase tlacololli, which means \\"something twisted.\\" Its original Zapotec name was Guillbaan, which means \\"village of the burials.\\" The appendage \\"de Matamoros\\" is to honor Mariano Matamoros of the Mexican War of Independence. History Facade of the La Asuncion church The Zapotecs probably arrived in the central valleys of Oaxaca in the 2nd century CE. At that time, much of the Tlacolula area was covered by a lake. Fray Juan de Torquemada thought that the Zapotecs arrived from a region called Panuco and established themselves first at Tule, with the first dominant settlement at Teotitl√°n del Valle. The early populations eventually drained the lake, and built a number of settlements. The first settlement nearest the modern city is at what is now San Antonio de la Cal, which was established around 1250 Eventually, the Zapotecs dominated most of the central valleys area. Tradition states that the city was first founded in Yagul, now an archeological site. There are two competing stories as to how the modern settlement was established by the Spanish. The first states that it was founded as a way station for Europeans traveling to and from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec at the location between the Salado and Seco Rivers. However, flooding forced the community to move to the present location. The other version has the settlement founded by friars Gonzalo Lucero and Bernardino de Minaya as an evangelization center and monastery, to which the native population eventually drifted. Either way, the settlement was formally established as Santa Maria de la Asuncion Tlacolula in 1560. One of the first major constructions in the Spanish settlement was the Church of La Asunci√≥n in 1561. Many of the religious festivals which continue to this day were established around the same time. After the establishment of the town, several haciendas were established belonging to the Alferez, Taniye and Soriano families. During the Mexican Revolution, factions loyal to Venustiano Carranza and Francisco Villa fought for dominance here, with battles in the Sierra Ju√°rez mountains and at the city itself. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city was well known for counterfeit goods, which was mostly eliminated in the 1980s. Since the 2000s, it has been making a comeback, especially in the form of unlicensed CDs and DVDs. During the 2006 Oaxaca protests, a number of \\"community radio stations\\" established to provide alternative outlets of information and propaganda. Since this time, most of these stations, including Radio Tlacolula (https://web.archive.org/web/20091226234239/http://tlacolularadio.msdnoticias.com/), have not been able to get operating licenses from the federal government and exist illegally. They have also been the target of opposition forces seeking to shut them down. One effort to do so was attempted in 2008, but it was not successful. Political tensions related to the election of a new municipal president have existed since 2009, with no apparent candidate. Much of the reason for this is the lack of support by the ejidos, or communal farm organizations. This issue for the ejidos is that the candidate must be from Tlacolula, and not candidates chosen by or associated with the state's dominant PRI party. The current president is from the PAN party, but is an ex- PRI member who is accused of blackmail. The members of the ejidos have the right to nominate or support candidates collectively, which is normally done at a meeting called the \\"Caudillo del Sur.\\" Municipal elections are scheduled to be held in 2010. In the early part of 2010, about 800 people organized into groups calling themselves \\"14 de junio,\\" \\"and \\"1 de mayo,\\" and took over lands legally belonging to Chagoya family. The people claim that they were not in possession of the land illegally and that Roberto Chagoya donated the land to families unable to afford to buy their own. The title of the land is under dispute with Ernesto Chagoya claiming ownership and denouncing the occupation. On 12 April 2010, municipal police forced the people off the land and the organizations have sought help from APPO and other organizations. The city Fruits and vegetables at the municipal market Chocolate La Tradici√≥n The city is the commercial and political center of the Tlacolula Valley, which is named after it. This valley is home to over 60,000 people, many of whom are Zapotec speakers.Lillehaugen, Brook Danielle. 2006. Expressing Location in Tlacolula Valley Zapotec. Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA. The streets of the city form rectangular grid, which spreads out from the 17th century Church of La Asunci√≥n and its adjoining plaza. The main street extends north-south and connects to the Pan American Highway (Federal Highway 190). This main street is lined with permanents shops, which are open on Sundays for the customers that come into town for the weekly market. Two notable stores along this street are the Mezcal Pensamento outlet and Chocolate la Tradici√≥n. Tlacolula is a major mezcal producer, and Mezcal Pensamento offers more than twenty varieties, many of which are flavored with fruit, coffee and more. At Chocolate la Tradici√≥n, chocolate is ground and mixed with sugar, spices and other ingredients to make chocolate for drinking or to use in the making of moles. Much of the chocolate sold here is for consumption in the more rural areas. Hot chocolate is a widely consumed beverage in the valley, prepared with either milk or water, and usually eaten with locally made \\"pan de yema\\" or egg yolk bread. Another important commercial location is the permanent municipal market which is located just off the main plaza. This market consists of two fifty by twenty meter semi-enclosed areas, each of which houses scores of vendors, mostly selling basic staples. It is known for its breads, ice cream and traditional cooking utensils such as comals and metates as well as traditional clothing. This market has a large food area that prepares many of the area's local and regional specialties, such as various moles (colorado, amarillo, verde and chichilo) as well as tlayudas and meats in sauces based on tomatoes and beans. Chapulines (edible grasshoppers) can be found as well. The local version of barbacoa is with goat meat in a dark red broth. The stew is accompanied by fresh corn tortillas, cabbage, radishes, cilantro and lime. Another traditional meal is to buy your meat and have it grilled on the spot, served with tortillas and condiments. Tlacolula also has an old train station, which no longer hosts trains but does contain businesses such as a those selling bacon, fireworks and other products. The Casa de Cultura is in the municipal palace and sponsored by the Instituto Oaxaque√±o de las Culturas. Altar area of the Capilla del Se√±or de Tlacolula The parish church, called the Church of \\"La Asunci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora\\" was founded as a Dominican mission in the mid 16th century. It consists of the main church and the Chapel of the Se√±or del Tlacolula. The exterior and interior of the church are largely similar to other Dominican churches in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca; the retablos are adorned with silver, and the doors have ornate ironwork. In the \\"coro alto\\" (rear gallery) stands a large baroque pipe organ, restored in 2014.http://iohio.org.mx/eng/organs9.htm Restoration of the Tlacolula Organ A notable feature is the Baroque chapel dedicated to a crucifix called the Se√±or de Tlacolula, one of several \\"black Christ\\" images (Chalma, Esquipulas, Ocotitlan) that appeared mysteriously, and to which miracles are attributed. This chapel can be accessed directly from the atrium but the main entrance is from the a main nave of the church through an ornate iron gate guarded by statues. The chapel is elaborately and ornately decorated, and some of saints are depicted in unusual ways. The chapel is a regional pilgrimage site. The widespread devotion to the Se√±or is such that Pope Pius VII issued an indulgence stating that priests officiating at this altar can have the sins of one who has recently died completely forgiven. The city hosts a number of religious and secular festivals during the year. Religious festivals include the feast of the Virgen del Rosario, (which was filmed by researchers from the University of Arizona), Day of the Dead and the feast of the Se√±or de Tlacolula. For Day of the Dead, the municipality sponsors an \\"ofrenda\\" (Day of the Dead altar) for grade school children. The first prize was $5000 MXN. The feast of the Christ of Tlacolula is held on the second Sunday of October, lasting five days, which is celebrated not only with traditional Masses, processions, folk dances and fireworks, but also with the Mixtec version of the Mesoamerican ball game. The \\"Fiestas de las Cruces\\" last for two months from May to the early part of July. To promote its principle products, the city hosts the annual Feria de Mezcal, Artesan√≠a y Gastronom√≠a (Mezcal, Crafts and Gastronomy Festival) in October. Despite its city status, one rural indigenous custom which is still practiced is the \\"tequio.\\" This is a form of communal work which is unpaid and done by community members for the public benefit. It is most often performed for infrastructure services such as laying water mains. Sometimes the tequio also consists of paying for part of the project. Another tradition which can still be found is the use of a \\"marriage broker\\" to get families to agree to the event. The Sunday market The Sunday open air market (or tianguis) of Tlacolula is one of the oldest continuous in Mesoamerica and the largest and busiest in the Central Valley region of Oaxaca. The only market of any type which is larger is the Centro de Abastos (main grocery market selling to retailers) in the city of Oaxaca. This market is part of a tradition of weekly markets which is still found in Oaxaca, where people from rural areas come the local town to buy, sell and socialize, and are a functional feature of pre-modern peasant economies. The market provides a retail outlet for those living in communities too small to support permanent retail establishments. Each Sunday, very early in the morning, officials close the main street for eight blocks between the main plaza and the bus station, near the highway. Paying fees for the right, vendors set up stalls all over these main road and along adjoining parts of the cross streets as well. Most are covered by low hanging colorful tarps which provide protection from sun and rain and almost completely cover the streets from the buildings on one side to those on the other. The most crowded and the most desired locations are those near the plaza and the permanent municipal market buildings. The main church and the municipal palace are both barely visible above all the tarps. Both pedestrian traffic and number of stalls decrease, the further way one gets from this area. The stalls here are set up early in the morning and taken down that night. The number of vendors on any given Sunday varies but the number usually exceeds 1,000. Counts have been as high as 1,400 and 1,600. Stalls divide into three types. The first is a simple cloth on the ground, with the vendor sitting or kneeling behind it and his/her wares all day. This cloth may contain only a few items or it may be full to the edge. The second type is a simple table or stacked boxes. The third is a stall with walls, often constructed of interconnecting metal rods. They type of stall used depends on the economics of the vendors and the types of products they sell. In addition to the stalls, street vendors walk around the market carrying their goods with them, approaching potential customers to ask for a sale. Generally, the Sunday merchants sell everyday household items, agricultural products, prepared foods, farm animals, mezcal, clothing, jewelry, kitchen utensils, audio CDs, tools, pottery for everyday use rather than purely decorative or tourist items such as barro negro pottery. Also not generally sold are heavy, bulky goods, which cannot be carried away by hand. While it is not unusual to see bananas stacked next to blue jeans, next to tools, most vendors of similar items tend to group together in certain zones. This is not done by formal agreement, mostly tradition, social contacts and economy play roles. For example, the sellers of rugs and blankets group together north of the churchyard, across from a grouping of vendors selling expensive handmade vests. This agglomeration has advantages for both buyer and seller. In this way, a wider range of goods can be offered and comparison shopping is somewhat possible. However, not all vendors of the same merchandise choose to sell near their competitors for a number of reasons, they do not want to compete price-wise, the stall space is too expensive or they use loudspeakers to attract customers. Market day is considered a festive day in Oaxacan towns. Ranchers, farmers and other people from rural areas come to the city to sell shop and socialize. Products, especially certain prepared foods, are available here that are generally not anywhere else. One example is tejate, a fermented corn and mamey seed drink. Most of the rural people who come to town on Sunday are indigenous, and seeing women dressed in colorful traditional garb, such as rebozos, embroidered blouses and wool skirts, is more common on this day than even in the municipal market during the week. Many of the indigenous women's home village can be identified by their clothing. It is common to see native women carrying bundles on their backs or on their heads. This is because most sellers are women.(psabor) These women tend to be quite traditional, speaking Zapotec, trading items instead of accepting money and not permitting the taking of their photographs. In the 1960s and 1970s, locals used to jokingly refer to this market as \\"Tokiolula\\" since it carried many counterfeit and cheap items from Asia. While the counterfeit goods were mostly eliminated in the 1980s, unauthorized CDs and DVDs, as well as other counterfeit goods have made their way back into the otherwise traditional market. The municipality =Political structure= As municipal seat, the city of Tlacolula is the governing authority for sixteen other named localities, the largest of which are San Marcos Tlapazola (pop.1114), San Luis del Rio (pop. 472) and Taniv√© (pop. 247).Over 85% of the municipalities population of 16,510 (2005) lives in the city proper,(inegi) with just over 4,000 who speak an indigenous language. The municipality covers an area of 244.96km2 and borders the municipalities of Santa Ana del Valle, Villa D√≠az Ordaz, San Pablo Villa de Mitla, Magdalena Teitipac, San Bartolom√© Quialana, San Lucas Quiavin√≠, Santiago Matatl√°n, San Dionisio Ocotepec, San Juan Guelav√≠a, Santa Cruz Papalutla, San Lorenzo Albarradas and San Pedro Quiatoni. =Geography= The city is located in the Tlacolula Valley, which is a broad valley with rich, volcanic soils. The climate is a cross between steppe and savannah. It only receives about fifty millimeters of rain per year, but its relatively cool climate allows this to be just sufficient enough to be classified as humid. Most of this falls in the summer and fall. Within the valley, the ground is small plains broken up by rolling hills and small streams, with larger mountains on the municipality's edge. Most of the wild plants consist of grasses with cactus and other arid area plants, such as mesquite. Wildlife consists of small mammals such as rabbits, opossums and moles along some species of birds. Rarely, an eagle can be seen. =Economy= Tlacolula is an urban commercial center for this part of the central valleys region of Oaxaca. Only a small percentage (23%) of the municipal population is engaged in agriculture as a primary means of support. Most of the population is dedicated to commerce serving the Tlacolula district (50%) and the production crafts, mezcal and other items.(25%). In recent years, the production and sale of counterfeit items has increased significantly, especially at the weekly Sunday market. While tourism has not been a significant part of the economy, the municipality has taken steps to promote its attractions, such as the 16th century church and its archeological sites. The municipality also participates in the annual Guelaguetza festival in the city of Oaxaca to showcase its culture. The area still has serious problems with poverty, with many social services such as education, sanitation and health services insufficient or lacking. This is particularly true in the outlying areas. For this reason, many residents of the municipality has immigrated to the United States, mostly congregating in the Venice Beach area of southern California. Many Zapotec-speaking peoples from the area work in stalls along the boardwalk or as cooks, waiters and mains in the upscale restaurants and hotels of Santa Monica. So many live in this area that Zapotec is the mother tongue for about thirty percent of school children in certain neighborhoods. = Tlacolula Valley Zapotec language = In April 2014, linguist Brook Danielle Lillehaugen, along with students from Haverford and Swarthmore Colleges, visited Tlacolula de Matamoros to present an online Tlacolula Valley Zapotec talking dictionary Tlacolula Valley Zapotec online talking dictionary to local leaders. It was estimated that about 100 elderly speakers of this Zapotecan language remain. =Archeological sites and culture= Ballcourt at Yagul The best known archeological site within the municipality proper is Yagul, a former city-state associated with the Zapotec civilization. The site was declared one of the country's four Natural Monuments on 13 October 1998. The site is also known locally as Pueblo Viejo (Old Village) and was occupied at the time of the Spanish Conquest. After the Conquest the population was relocated to modern Tlacolula where their descendants still live. Yagul was first occupied around 500-100 BC. Around 500-700 AD, residential, civic and ceremonial structures were built at the site. However, most of the visible remains date to 1250-1521 AD, when the site functioned as the capital of a Postclassic city-state. The site was excavated in the 1950s and 60s by archaeologists Ignacio Bernal and John Paddock. Rock shelter with human figure etched into it on the road to Yagul More recently catalogued and recognized are a group of about one hundred caves and rock shelters in the Tlacolula Valley which are found in the Tlacolula and other municipalities. The significance of these caves is that many have pre-historic cave paintings and/or evidence of the transition of humans from hunter/gatherers to sedentary farmers due to the domestication of corn and other plants on the American continent. INAH has worked to recommended these caves to become a World Heritage Site with investigation and documentation ongoing. The site was inscribed onto Mexico's \\"Lista Indicativa de M√©xico\\" in the 2000s and WHS recognition was received in 2007. The caves and rock shelters vary in size and what they contain. Many contain paintings and other forms of graphic representation. Contents include ceramics and stone tools. The corn materials show similarities to the first vestiges of the domestication of wheat and rye in the Middle East. One of the deepest caves is called the Cueva de la Paloma. The caves have been studied since the 1960s, especially the Cueva de Guil√° Naquitz (white stone in Zapotec), which has some of the best evidence for the domestication of corn and squash, which dates back more than 10,000 years. Other caves, such as those near Yagual and Mitla confirm findings at Guil√° Naquitz and show human occupation to about 8000 years BCE the sites also show similarities to the Head Smashed and Buffalo Jump Complex sites in Canada. Many more smaller caves with similar artifacts are thought to exist in the area. One of the local legends is called \\"La Mujer Coyota\\" or The Coyote Woman. A young man who was well known for being honest and hardworking fell in love with a woman from another village. Courtship followed in the traditional manner, the two married and he went to live with her. Soon after, the woman confessed that she was a nagual (an Aztec demon) in the form of a coyote. She told the man that if he let her change him into a coyote, they could be together forever. Being in love, the man accepted immediately. As a coyote, the man found that in order to survive, he needed to rob attack farm animals and eat the meat raw, which he had never done before. He also found that the other coyotes did not respect him, and sniffed about his woman. One day, his hunger took him to his old village and to the home of his former childhood friend. He tried to steal food from his friend, only to be attacked with a machete. He friend cried that he was a no good coyote who had no idea how to earn his bread. Upon hearing this, the man felt shame. He returned to his wife as asked her to change him back into a man, which she did cursing. Returned to human form, the man killed his wife-coyote and returned to being an honest worker.

He served as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas for Ireland from 1701 to 1703, Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1703 to 1707 and as Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench for Ireland from 1711 to 1714.  Early life  Cox was born in Bandon, County Cork, Ireland. He was the great-great- grandson of Richard Cox (died 1581), Bishop of Ely from 1559 to 1581 and Chancellor of Oxford from 1547 to 1552. His family had arrived from Wiltshire in about 1600, and was dispossessed in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. His father was Captain Richard Cox II (1610‚Äì1651) and his mother was Katherine Bird, daughter of Walter Bird, and widow of Captain Thomas Batten. She was born in Clonakilty, County Cork, Ireland and died in 1651/52, probably in Bandon. Her death was generally said to be caused by grief for her second husband, who was murdered by one Captain Norton in 1651 in unexplained circumstances. Richard was thus orphaned by the age of three, and was raised by his maternal grandparents and his uncle John Bird in County Cork. He went to school in Clonakilty, and then by his own account spent \\"three years idling\\". Having inherited a small property from his grandfather, he went to England to study law. Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, the judge's great-great-grandfather  Career  He qualified at Gray's Inn, London, in 1673; and was apprenticed in the manorial courts of the Earl of Cork. In 1674, apparently on the advice of his uncle John, he made an imprudent marriage to Mary Bourne, a girl of fifteen, whose family he later claimed had grossly deceived him as to the size of her dowry. Although the marriage itself was happy enough, he quarreled bitterly with his mother-in-law about the dowry, retired to the country for a time, and then resolved to make his fortune at the Irish Bar. He built up a lucrative legal practice, was appointed Recorder of Kinsale, and acquired an estate at Clonakilty in about 1687; but he lost his recordership after the accession of James II. He moved to Bristol, where he practiced as a barrister. There he became acquainted with the Irish-born diplomat Sir Robert Southwell, later to be Secretary of State (Ireland). Southwell introduced him to the Duke of Ormonde, who acted thereafter as his patron. Politician and judge  He returned to Ireland, and fought at the Boyne in 1690. Following William's victory at the Boyne, Cox drafted the Declaration of Finglas offering full protection (in effect a pardon) to all Jacobites who laid down arms by 1 August 1690, (later extended to 25 August), other than those described as \\"the desperate leaders of the Rebellion\\". The King praised Cox's drafting of the Declaration, saying that he had not needed to change a word of it. He was knighted on 5 November 1692 by King William, who had a great respect for him, and then became a baronet on 21 November 1706. He was made Recorder of Waterford and second justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1690. He was subsequently appointed military governor of Cork in 1691 and a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1692. He approved of the Treaty of Limerick, which offered generous terms to the defeated Jacobites. When it became clear that the Government would not honour the terms of the Treaty, Cox denounced this as a breach of trust, and was in political disgrace for a time as a result, being dismissed from the Privy Council in 1695. This was only a temporary career setback: he became Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas in 1701, and was reappointed to the Privy Council the same year. Although he maintained that as a matter of simple justice they should receive what they were promised under the Treaty of Limerick, Cox was no friend to Roman Catholics. He fully supported the strict enforcement, and indeed the extension, of the Penal Laws, and as Lord Chancellor he oversaw the passage of the Popery Act of 1703, which was generally seen as an effort to eliminate the Catholic landowning class entirely. He became Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1703 and then Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench from 1711‚Äì1714, after being dismissed in 1707 for his opposition to the proposed repeal of the sacramental test for religious dissenters in that year.J. C. Beckett, Protestant Dissent in Ireland, 46 He escaped impeachment when his great patron Ormonde defected to the Jacobite cause in 1715 and fled to France. Publications  He was the author of an early history of Ireland as regarded from the standpoint of the New English; Hibernia Anglicana, or, The History of Ireland (1689‚Äì90), (called ‚Äòtrite‚Äô by Oxford Dictionary of National Biography); purporting to be the first chronological history of Ireland, and incidentally attacking \\"the ridiculous stories which they have publish of the Firbolgs and Tuah-de-danans\\". When Aodh Bu√≠ Mac Cruit√≠n, hereditary poet to the O‚ÄôBriens of Thomond a representative of the Gaelic literati, in the preface of 'A Brief Discourse in Vindication of the Antiquity of Ireland', published in 1717, refuted some of the statements made in 'Hibernia Anglicana', Cox had him imprisoned in New Gate prison for one year. Later years  He lived 20 years in retirement before his death, from apoplexy, in the Great Hall of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. He devoted much effort in his later years to improving the town of Dunmanway: he obtained a royal charter to hold fairs and market days in the town, and did much to encourage the local flax industry. Thanks largely to his efforts, by the time of his death Dunmanway was a flourishing little town of some 600 citizens. Dunmanway, County Cork, present day: Sir Richard Cox was the town's first important patron.  Personal life  He was married to Mary Bourne, daughter of John Bourne, on 26 February 1674. She was born in 1658 in County Cork, Ireland, and died on 1 June 1715. Cox praised her as a very good wife, while admitting frankly that he might not have married her if he had known how small her fortune was (this was the cause of a bitter family quarrel). They had numerous children: Cox himself mentions twenty-one, though only fifteen can be identified with certainty, some of whom died in infancy. Of those who reached adulthood, the eldest son, also Richard, predeceased his father. A younger son, Michael, was Archbishop of Cashel from 1754 to 1779, and built a magnificent mansion, Castletown Cox, which still exists. The eldest daughter Amy married Sir William Mansel, the seventh of the Mansel baronets in 1700, and had five children, including Sir Richard Mansel, 8th Baronet. Her sister Mary married Arthur Riggs in 1701; after his death she remarried Rev. Nicholas Skolfield, Vicar of Drinagh. Cox's letters give vivid evidence of a lively and charming personality Ball The Judges in Ireland :he welcomes additions to his numerous offspring, describes the pleasures of good food and drink, and his love of music and fine clothes. In character he was strictly honest and upright, and was in general considered to be a good judge, though his prejudice against Catholics meant that he cannot have been impartial in cases raising a question of religion.

(; born c. 1380 at Dubrovnik, Republic of Ragusa) was a Croatian Dominican theologian. He died at Lausanne, Switzerland in 1443. He was president of the Council of Basle, and a legate to Constantinople. He was created cardinal by Antipope Felix V, so would be considered by many a \\"pseudocardinal\\". Life He entered the Dominican Order and devoted himself to the observance of the rule of his order and the study of the sacred sciences. By reason of his great attainments in theology, Scripture, and the Oriental languages, he was considered an oracle in his native Dalmatia. In 1420 he became a master of theology at the University of Paris.Matthew Bunson, OSV's Encyclopedia of Catholic History (2004), p. 505. In the year 1426 he was appointed procurator general of the Dominican Order, and went to reside at Rome under Pope Martin V. There he received marks of honour and esteem from the pope and the College of Cardinals, and the former eventually named him papal theologian for the General Council of Basle. John was, moreover, chosen to open the council, in place of Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who was detained by other business. Arriving at Basle on 19 May 1431, he on the same day arranged with the Bishop of Basle for the opening of the council on the 23rd of the same month. The opening did not take place, however, until 23 July 1431, in the cathedral church, when John preached from the text: \\"Et angelus testamenti, quem vos vultis. Ecce venit\\" (Mal., iii, 1). In the council he exonerated the absent cardinals from the charge of contempt (Feb., 1433). On eight mornings he spoke against the doctrines of the Hussites.Hinnebusch: 5 The Fifteenth Century Having been sent as a legate of the council to Constantinople to urge the reunion of the Eastern and Western Churches, John of Ragusa induced the Emperor John Paleologus and the Patriarch Joseph to send an embassy to the council through the treaty which they made with Pope Eugenius IV was broken by the Greeks. John afterwards sojourned at Constantinople to study the Greek language and to become better acquainted with the situation of ecclesiastical affairs. Here he completed an etymological work bearing upon the Greek text of Scripture and destined to be of service to Catholic controversialists in treating of the doctrine of the Procession of the Holy Ghost against the Greek \\"schismatics\\". He returned to Bologna as a member of a deputation, to obtain from Eugenius IV an assurance that the pope would be present at the council. Having acceded to this request, Eugenius employed John once more to be the bearer of a document (dated 15 July 1437) to the Greek emperor in which the emperor's assistance was invited at a meeting of the council to be held in some Italian city. John's subsequent course has been a subject of dispute: some authors assert that he remained in sympathy with the council, while others insist that he allied himself with Eugenius IV, who made him Bishop of Argos. It is probable that he took the side of Eugenius. Works His extant writings are: *Tractatus de Ecclesia, published in Zagreb in 1986; *Discourse against the Hussites delivered at the Council of Basle; *the Acts, or Reports, of his embassies to Constantinople, to be found among the Acts of the Council of Basle; *an account of his travels in the East, preserved by Leo Allatius. His work on Greek indeclinable nouns and Scriptural Greek etymology seems to have been lost.

It combines pseudospectral (PS) theory with optimal control theory to produce PS optimal control theory. PS optimal control theory has been used in ground and flight systems in military and industrial applications. The techniques have been extensively used to solve a wide range of problems such as those arising in UAV trajectory generation, missile guidance, control of robotic arms, vibration damping, lunar guidance, magnetic control, swing-up and stabilization of an inverted pendulum, orbit transfers, tether libration control, ascent guidance and quantum control. Overview There are a very large number of ideas that fall under the general banner of pseudospectral optimal control. Examples of these are the Legendre pseudospectral method, the Chebyshev pseudospectral method, the Gauss pseudospectral method, the Ross-Fahroo pseudospectral method, the Bellman pseudospectral method, the flat pseudospectral method and many others. Solving an optimal control problem requires the approximation of three types of mathematical objects: the integration in the cost function, the differential equation of the control system, and the state-control constraints. An ideal approximation method should be efficient for all three approximation tasks. A method that is efficient for one of them, for instance an efficient ODE solver, may not be an efficient method for the other two objects. These requirements make PS methods ideal because they are efficient for the approximation of all three mathematical objects. In a pseudospectral method, the continuous functions are approximated at a set of carefully selected quadrature nodes. The quadrature nodes are determined by the corresponding orthogonal polynomial basis used for the approximation. In PS optimal control, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials are commonly used. Mathematically, quadrature nodes are able to achieve high accuracy with a small number of points. For instance, the interpolating polynomial of any smooth function (C\\\\infty) at Legendre‚ÄìGauss‚ÄìLobatto nodes converges in L2 sense at the so- called spectral rate, faster than any polynomial rate. Details A basic pseudospectral method for optimal control is based on the covector mapping principle. Other pseudospectral optimal control techniques, such as the Bellman pseudospectral method, rely on node-clustering at the initial time to produce optimal controls. The node clusterings occur at all Gaussian points. Moreover, their structure can be highly exploited to make them more computationally efficient, as ad-hoc scaling and Jacobian computation methods, involving dual number theory have been developed. In pseudospectral methods, integration is approximated by quadrature rules, which provide the best numerical integration result. For example, with just N nodes, a Legendre-Gauss quadrature integration achieves zero error for any polynomial integrand of degree less than or equal to 2N-1. In the PS discretization of the ODE involved in optimal control problems, a simple but highly accurate differentiation matrix is used for the derivatives. Because a PS method enforces the system at the selected nodes, the state-control constraints can be discretized straightforwardly. All these mathematical advantages make pseudospectral methods a straightforward discretization tool for continuous optimal control problems.

A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control, Second Edition, Collegiate Publishers, San Francisco, 2015.Eren, H., \\"Optimal Control and the Software,\\" Measurements, Instrumentation, and Sensors Handbook, Second Edition, CRC Press, 2014, pp.92-1-16. It is widely used in academia, industry, and NASA. Hailed as a breakthrough software, DIDO is based on the pseudospectral optimal control theory of Ross and Fahroo. Usage DIDO utilizes trademarked expressions and objects that facilitate a user to quickly formulate and solve optimal control problems.A. M. Hawkins, Constrained Trajectory Optimization of a Soft Lunar Landing From a Parking Orbit, S.M. Thesis, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2005. http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/32431 Rapidity in formulation is achieved through a set of DIDO expressions which are based on variables commonly used in optimal control theory. For example, the state, control and time variables are formatted as: * primal.states, * primal.controls, and * primal.time The entire problem is codified using the key words, cost, dynamics, events and path: * problem.cost * problem.dynamics * problem.events, and * problem.path A user runs DIDO using the one-line command: \`[cost, primal, dual] = dido(problem, algorithm)\`, where the object defined by \`algorithm\` allows a user to choose various options. In addition to the cost value and the primal solution, DIDO automatically outputs all the dual variables that are necessary to verify and validate a computational solution. The output \`dual\` is computed by an application of the covector mapping principle. Theory DIDO implements a spectral algorithm based on pseudospectral optimal control theory founded by Ross and his associates. The covector mapping principle of Ross and Fahroo eliminates the curse of sensitivity associated in solving for the costates in optimal control problems. DIDO generates spectrally accurate solutions whose extremality can be verified using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. Because no knowledge of pseudospectral methods is necessary to use it, DIDO is often used as a fundamental mathematical tool for solving optimal control problems. That is, a solution obtained from DIDO is treated as a candidate solution for the application of Pontryagin's minimum principle as a necessary condition for optimality. Applications DIDO is used world wide in academia, industry and government laboratories.Q. Gong, W. Kang, N. Bedrossian, F. Fahroo, P. Sekhavat and K. Bollino, Pseudospectral Optimal Control for Military and Industrial Applications, 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, New Orleans, LA, pp. 4128-4142, Dec. 2007. Thanks to NASA, DIDO was flight-proven in 2006. On November 5, 2006, NASA used DIDO to maneuver the International Space Station to perform the zero-propellant maneuver. Since this flight demonstration, DIDO was used for the International Space Station and other NASA spacecraft. L.

In promoting work that initially found few to favor it, he was able to reassure potential clients with his irresistible and often mischievous charm, dazzle them with his flamboyant personality and often sensational mode of dress.Alexander Iolas, the Greek art dealer, was seen in a floor-length raccoon coat, throwing bills in the air Inside Art The New York Times, July 2, 1993 Known primarily for his exclusive representation of the major European Surrealists in the United States- primarily Max Ernst and Ren√© Magritte - Alexander Iolas helped to form more than one important collection. In particular, John de Menil and Dominique de Menil, founders of the Menil Collection, retained him as one of their three art consultants, along with Father Marie-Alain Couturier and Jermayne MacAgy.Collection Overview The Menil Collection In 1972, Iolas took over Carla Lavatelli's studio at 75th Street and 1st Ave. in New York for an exhibition. It was the first exhibition by a dealer at an artist's studio. In 1976, he closed all his galleries except the one in New York after the death of Max Ernst, in order to keep a promise he had made to the artist. After the Iolas Gallery in Paris was closed in 1976, his former assistant Samy Kinge continued to run his own gallery with a similar program. In 1984, Alexander Iolas commissioned Andy Warhol to create a group of works based on Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper for an exhibition space in the Palazzo delle Stelline in Milan, located across the street from Santa Maria delle Grazie, home of Leonardo's masterpiece. Warhol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced more than 100 variations on the theme. From early 1965, Alexander Iolas started traveling to Greece. Extending his activities there, he contributed to the opening of some galleries in Athens, like the Iolas- Zoumboulakis galleryAlexander Iolas in Athens The ACG Art CollectionAlexander Iolas and Zoumboulakis Zoumboulaki Gallery and the Bernier Gallery. He also inspired the founding of the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art in Thessaloniki to which he donated a large number of art works from his collection. He is still listed as the Museum's 'great benefactor'. In 1983, he was accused by a former employee of \\"antiquities smuggling, drug peddling, and the prostitution of young men\\"- but never charged,Alexander Iolas and Avriani Alexandre Iolas by Gary Comenas accusations that were circulated by the Greek tabloid newspaper, Avriani causing a scandal. In 1984, he was investigated for antiquities smuggling and subsequently charged. The charges were cleared only posthumously. He died of AIDS at Cornell Medical Center in New York City on Monday, June 8, 1987.Alexander Iolas obituary New York Times June 12, 1987 Villa Iolas From 1951 until 1972, Iolas built a 1300 square meter villa on a 7000 square meter lot in Agia Paraskevi, a suburb of AthensWhere all that glitters is gold Vogue, 1982 There he stored and exhibited his art collection with the idea that one day it would become the \\"Alexander Iolas Museum\\". When he died in 1987, his sister, Niki Stifel, and his previously deceased brother's daughter, Eleni Koutsoudi-Iola became the heirs to his estate. His villa was sold to a real estate developer, but construction plans were held up by the Ministry of Culture that marked it as a site of Greek cultural heritage. Plans to transform his collection into the envisioned museum never were acted upon by the Greek government. As a result the collection was looted and the villa has been vandalized extensively.‚ÄòVilla Iolas‚Äô and its melancholic history Dimitris Rigopoulos 'Kathimerini' newspaper, July 6, 2006Cotter, Holland, \\"An abundance of room, an absence of V.I.P. gloss,\\" The New York Times, March 4, 2010.

Villa Iolas was listed in 1998 as a historic monument by the Greek Ministry of Culture, two years later was designated the site for exclusively public cultural activities and recently the re-selling of the estate has been blocked. The Greek State has not expropriated the Villa, however.

The project was promoted by the Department of Trade and IndustryDesign Productivity Journal with the support of most of the largest UK firms in the construction industry. Avanti also involved the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI), Loughborough University and Co-Construct, a network of five construction research and information organizations. The Avanti programme aimed to help overcome problems caused by incomplete, inaccurate and ambiguous information.\\"An historical problem\\" , Construction Journal, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, April 2006 Background The Tavistock Institute report (1965) printed an extract from an RICS meeting of 1910 which stated \\"Architectural information is invariably inaccurate, ambiguous and incomplete\\". By the 1940s, the impact of this was valued at an additional 10% to the construction cost. By 1994 the Latham Report Constructing the Team suggested waste in the industry accounted for 25-30% of project costs. This figure is supported by earlier publications from the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and the Building Services Research and Information Association (BSRIA), which led to reports in 1987 from the Coordinating Committee for Project Information (now CPIC) that recommended a common format and disciplined approach to reduce the problem. These suggestions were proven on DTI-funded projects and case studies at Endeavour House at London Stansted Airport and the BAA Heathrow Express, which showed that significant savings in project cost and drawing production could be made by addressing people and process issues. The problem and approach Most construction projects are complex and involve co-ordination between many project participants both on- and off-site. As projects have increased in size and complexity, the number of participants involved in a single project has also increased. To improve collaboration between participants, the industry needs tools that work well, appropriate processes to implement them, and the right approach from the people involved. Tackling these points was at the heart of the Avanti action research programme.Modern Building Services (MBS) Journal Its purpose was to support live construction project teams, as they collaborate to deliver projects, by helping them apply the appropriate technologies. It worked through a team of partners representing each stage of the project process, with the objective of improving project and business performance through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support collaborative working. It set out to show the advantages of CAD systems over conventional drawings, with information managed as a database rather than a drawing cabinet, and aimed to demonstrate that 3D Computer Aided Design systems could revolutionise projects, provided they were used for more than visualisation. To reduce the risks involved in adopting new working methods, Avanti brought together areas of current best practice (such as CPIC protocols) that had previously gained too little market penetration to have significant impact on the sector. The objective was to deliver improved project and business performance by using ICT to support collaborative working. Avanti focused on early access to all project information by all partners, on early involvement of the supply chain, and on sharing of information, drawings and schedules, in an agreed and consistent manner. The Avanti approach was supported by handbooks, toolkits and on-site mentoring and was reliant on advice and materials provided by CPIC. Avanti mobilised existing technologies to improve business performance by increasing the quality of information and predictability of outcomes and by reducing risk and waste. The core of the Avanti approach to a project's whole life cycle was based on team-working and access to a common information model. All CAD information was generated with the same origin, orientation and scale, and organised in layers that could be shared. All layers and CAD model files were named consistently within a specific Avanti convention to allow others to find the relevant CAD data. Guidance and Phases Learning from early projects, Avanti produced practical working documentation and tested the methods on live projects. This information supplemented the CPIC document Code of Procedure for the Construction Industry and addressed problems of incomplete, inaccurate and ambiguous information. Avanti guidance included: * Standard Method and Procedure - advice on classification standards, spatial and technical co-ordination, example file and directory structures, and naming conventions. * Design Management Principles - comprising typical design management processes, information management processes, guidance on detailed task management and typical responsibilities of delivery team leaders. The advice also covers areas such as: * a business case on the commercial imperatives for collaborative ICT * guidance on ensuring the software chain supported the design and supply chains * authoring information in a common data environment and controlling the sharing of information in a multi-author environment For most projects, using this guidance consisted of three phases: * Phase 1: Change the poor industry practice of producing information to individual standards and throwing it ‚Äòover the wall‚Äô to the next person in the supply chain who then reproduces their own information. Using an agreed standard for the project, spatially co-ordinated and high-quality 2D information will then be produced for the parties involved. * Phase 2: Implementation of those same principles to generate 3D project models to produce 2D drawings and material measurement. * Phase 3: Full implementation of 3D object-oriented and Building information modelling systems. Each live project captures the lessons learned and the benefits gained. Further development In July 2006, the Avanti DTI Project documentation and brand ownership was transferred to Constructing Excellence. Since the handover, Constructing Excellence endeavoured to promote the savings demonstrated on live projects. Further work was also carried out to make Avanti part of the update of BS 1192.British Standards, BS 1192:2007 Collaborative production of architectural, engineering and construction information. Code of practice The BS 5555 committee coded the methods. BS 5555 Results Evaluation of the impacts of the Avanti project showed: * Early commitment offering up to 80% saving on implementation cost on medium size project. * 50-85% saving on effort spent receiving information and formatting for reuse. * 60-80% saving on effort spent finding information and documents. * 75‚Äì80% saving in effort to achieve design co-ordination. * 50% saving on time spent to assess tenders and award sub-contracts. * 50% saving on effort in sub-contractor design approval. The future Constructing Excellence is developing a self- sustaining business to support roll out of the Avanti methodology to the UK construction industry. It will also draw on the results of other DTI-supported collaborative research such as Building Down Barriers.Building Down Barriers See also * CPIC References External links * Avanti website * Constructing Excellence Avanti * What is Avanti? * People + Process + Tools * IAI home page Civil engineering Construction in the United Kingdom Research projects Organizations established in 2002 Loughborough University 2002 establishments in the United Kingdom Research in the United States Projects established in 2002 ","title":"Avanti (project)"},{"id":"15984041","text":"The 1980 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament took place on February 27 ‚Äì March 1, 1980, in Birmingham, Alabama, at the Birmingham‚ÄìJefferson Convention Complex.

He was also the nephew of his namesake Benjamin Carr (1731‚Äì80), who ran an instrument-making and repair shop in London for over 20 years. He studied organ with Charles Wesley and composition with Samuel Arnold. In 1793 he traveled to Philadelphia with a stage company, and a year later went with the same company to New York, where he stayed until 1797. Later that year he moved to Philadelphia, where he became a prominent member of the city‚Äôs musical life. Carr published the very first sheet music covered by copyright under the new United States Constitution, The Kentucky Volunteer. He was \\"decidedly the most important and prolific music publisher in America during the 1790s (as well as one of its most distinguished composers), conducting, in addition to his Philadelphia business, a New York branch from 1794 to 1797, when it was acquired by James Hewitt\\".Wolfe, 1980, Early American Music Engraving and Printing, p. 43 In 1794 he began publishing \\"a new song every Monday\\". The initial offering, The Kentucky Volunteer, is noteworthy as the first song copyrighted under the new US Constitution. This song was composed by Carr's friend and fellow English immigrant, Raynor Taylor. This particular \\"each Monday\\" series, however, only lasted 5 weeks. Carr was well-known as a teacher of keyboard and singing, and he served as organist and choirmaster at St Augustine's Catholic Church (1801‚Äì31) and at St Peter's Episcopal Church (1816‚Äì31). In 1820 he was one of the principal founders of the Musical Fund Society of Philadelphia, Phono Archive and he is known as the \\"Father of Philadelphia Music\\".Smith, 1986, The New Grove Dictionary of American Music, 1st edition, p. 360 Mrs. French, who had achieved a degree of fame as a singer, was one of his students. Music Carr's best known orchestral work was the Federal Overture (1794), composed for theatrical audiences. He published many of own 61 art songs in two serial anthologies, the Musical Journal for the Piano Forte (1800‚Äì04) and Carr‚Äôs Musical Miscellany in Occasional Numbers (1812‚Äì25). Also among his songs are several sets of ballads, including Six Ballads from The Lady of the Lake op.7, published in the same year (1810) as the poem by Sir Walter Scott on which they are based; the set contains the Hymn to the Virgin (\\"Ave Maria\\"), which is especially notable for its harp-like arpeggiated accompaniment. Carr‚Äôs most popular song was ‚ÄúThe Little Sailor Boy‚Äù (1798).Peter Dickinson et al., \\"Art Song\\", section 1, c1750‚Äìc1850, The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition, vol. I, p. 209 He was perhaps the first American composer to set a Shakespeare text to music, and his Hymn to the Virgin (1810) is generally considered one of the finest early American songs. His piano music includes shorter sonatas, rondos and variation forms; much of it was written for pedagogical purposes, although a few works are more technically advanced. He also wrote several important pedagogical works, including the Lessons and Exercises in Vocal Music (c.1811) and The Analytical Instructor for the Piano Forte (1826).

He is considered a founder of the modern Kiev violin school.Benty, Y. (2008) Kiev honored memory of Aleksey Gorokhov. In Kommersant, No. 25, 15 February 2008. Moscow: Kommersant. Online at Biography Between 1934 and 1944 Aleksey Gorokhov studied at the Moscow Central Music School for Gifted Children. Later he entered Moscow Conservatory where he studied with Lev Tseitlin, graduating in 1949. In 1955 he finished Post-Graduate study under the instruction of Abram Yampolsky. In addition to his violin diploma he received a degree in Musicology. Between 1949 and 1951 Gorokhov took part in several international violin competitions, among them the Bach Competition in 1950 where he received 2nd prize. At the Queen Elizabeth Competition in 1951 he was awarded 7th Prize. This followed by him touring extensively in the Soviet Union as well as in Germany, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Romania, Portugal and Korea. In 1957 he became a professor of the violin at the Kiev Conservatory (later renamed Tchaikovsky National Academy of Music) and taught there until the end of his life. Gorokhov lived a simple, humble life. One of the primary factors in his decision to move to Kiev in 1956 was a disinterest in the politics of his Russian homeland. This may partly explain why, apart from being declared an \\"Honored Artist Worker of Ukraine\\", he wasn't given a formal status in other countries. Discography * 2008: Spanish Violin by Aleksey Gorokhov * 2008: Fritz Kreisler by Aleksey Gorokhov * 2008: Niccolo Paganini by Aleksey Gorokhov Notable works During 50 years of his creative life Gorokhov recorded a great number of disks, being the first violinist in the Soviet Union to record all 6 violin concertos by Niccolo Paganini. To Ukrainian Radio he left over 70 hours of recorded music, including Bach's Sonatas and Partitas, Paganini's 24 Caprices, 24 preludes by Shostakovich (Gorokhov's own arrangement), Violin Concertos by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Brahms, and many other. To mark Gorokhov's 70th Birthday he performed once again the 6 Paganini Concertos within 2 days. The Concertos were presented in an original orchestration by Gorokhov, which most completely embodied the criteria of Paganini's virtuoso-romantic aesthetics in orchestra. This arrangement is intended for a string orchestra with solo instruments besides the solo violin such as: guitar, viola and double bass, making Gorokhov's orchestration unique. His recordings of the Concertos recorded with the Ukrainian National Opera Theatre Orchestra between 1973 and 1978, were digitally remastered and re-released in 2006. Gorokhov's 1952 recording of √âdouard Lalo's Spanish symphony with the USSR State Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Kyrill Kondrashin is also notable. Quotations about Gorokhov Gorokhov's playing received high praise from a number of prominent musicians including Pierre Fournier, Jacques Thibaud, Joseph Szigeti, David Oistrakh and others. : \\"...The sound reminds one of the best time of Kreisler...the beauty of the 'piano' and 'pianissimo' is extraordinary...\\" - from Fournier's letter to Gorokhov. : \\"...Gorokhov's playing cast a spell on me...\\" - Jacques Thibaut. : \\"...There were very positive references...[made to] the nobility and tasteful playing of A. Gorokhov\\" - from 'A conversation with D. Oistrakh' in 'Novoye Vremia' magazine. : \\"...Listeners were struck...by the noble simplicity and modesty in conjunction with perfect playing skill, which was typical to A. Gorokhov...\\" - Alexander Svechnikov, 'Sovietskoye Iskustvo' magazine. : \\"...There are 2 great violin players whose sound is unmistakable and will stay in history - they are Kreisler and Gorokhov.\\" - Abram Shtern. Trivia Aleksey Gorokhov has erroneously been referred to as 'Alexander Gorokhov' on a CD release by Yedang Entertainment, leading some websites and music vendors to list him under the wrong name.

It was penned for the movie Cyborg She, starring Haruka Ayase and Keisuke Koide. At a press conference for the film, the director, Kwak Jae-yong, explained his choice of theme song: > The movie runs the panoply of emotions ‚Äî from love to sadness to sorrow to > exhilaration ‚Äî and by having this song play at the end, the main focus is > brought back to love, which is why it is perfect for the film. The B-side, \\"So Beautiful,\\" was written by Misia, composed by Toshiaki Matsumoto and produced by Tohru Shigemi.

Launched on 27 February 2008, and closed on August 7th 2018, it was the company's first major release after their successful MMORPG, RuneScape. All of the games were programmed in Java. Jagex had announced that this site was targeted towards the \\"hard casual\\", \\"deep casual\\" or \\"time-pressured\\" gamer market and that it intended to expand into the mobile phone games market. On 3 December 2009, Jagex released its first mobile phone game, Bouncedown, for the iPhone and iPod touch, followed by StarCannon on 15 April 2010, Miner Disturbance on 8 June 2010, and Undercroft on 16 September 2010. Summary A screenshot showing Arcanists, one of the games on FunOrb. FunOrb offered single-player and multiplayer games. Multiplayer games allowed players to communicate with each other through a public lobby, game chat, which could be used while playing in a game, or through private chat, which could be used to talk to people on RuneScape, and vice versa. In all released multiplayer games, players received a separate rating for each game, which symbolised their experience with the games and could rise or fall based on their rated game performance. In all released multiplayer games, with the exception of the persistent-world game, Dungeon Assault, players could play \\"rated\\" games, which found random opponents and adjusted their rating based on their performance, or they could play unrated games with people of their choice, which had no effect on their rating. The site included an achievement system which gave awards for completing challenges in single-player and multiplayer games. These included \\"Orb Coins\\", which players were able to spend on a variety of game content including desktop wallpapers, music, icons, and more. Also awarded were \\"Orb Points\\", which could be compared to those of other players. The site was launched in English, German, French and Brazilian Portuguese. Jagex stated that FunOrb would be updated every two weeks, either with a new game, an update to a game or an updated site feature, but the last website update was on 2 December 2014.We have an Update?!? General forumConfined - Where did this game come from? Jagex stated in 2008 that they were considering adding third party games to the site, but at the time of the site closing only Jagex created games were ever released. Cost Another screenshot showing the game Armies of Gielinor. Limited versions of all FunOrb games were available for free, with costs covered by advertising. Some games were completely free, with the exception of fullscreen mode. Players had the option of becoming paying subscribers, which gave them access to more ingame content, among other things the option to play games in fullscreen mode and an increased amount of achievements. Subscribers were also granted immediate access to the FunOrb forums, whereas non-subscribers were required to have obtained at least 42 achievements before being allowed to post. Holiday events From 22 October 2008 to 5 November 2008, special Halloween Achievements were spread across 10 games, with each of those games having a temporary Halloween theme. These were re-released on 28 October 2009, along with Achievements and Halloween themes for several other games. On 18 December 2008, an update for the game Arcanists was released in celebration of Christmas, in the form of several costumes that players could buy with Orb Coins. Shutdown On 9 May 2018 Jagex announced that FunOrb would be closed down on 7 August, stating that \\"advancements in software and hardware have made it increasingly difficult to access and play the games on the portal, and that‚Äôs ultimately led to our decision.\\" On the same day, Jagex Moderator \\"Mod Meadows\\" started taking applications for free three-month FunOrb memberships as \\"a great way to say 'goodbye'\\". Applications were taken until May 11 with memberships being sent out the following week. While the shutdown announcement had said \\"we‚Äôll be keeping the servers online until 7th of August 2018\\", the servers were not immediately shut off as they still remained online throughout the morning as each game was slowly shutdown.

Following Omar Bongo's coming to power in 1967 the U.S. continued diplomatic relations despite Bongo's autocratic tendencies. In 1987, President Bongo made an official visit to Washington, DC. In September 2002, Secretary of State Colin Powell made a brief but historic visit to Gabon to highlight environmental protection and conservation in the Central Africa region. This was followed by a visit to the White House by President Bongo in May 2004. The United States imports a considerable percentage of Gabonese crude oil and manganese, and exports heavy construction equipment, aircraft, and machinery to Gabon. Through a modest International Military Education and Training program, the United States provides military training to members of the Gabonese armed forces each year. Other bilateral assistance includes the funding of small grants for qualified democracy and human rights, self-help, and cultural preservation projects.

The United States for its part is actively assisting Georgia in strengthening its state institutions in face of increasing pressure from its northern neighbor Russia and has provided the country with financial assistance in excess of 3 billion dollars since 1991.Department of State Background Notes:Georgia Since 2009, Georgian‚ÄìAmerican relations are streamlined by the U.S.‚ÄìGeorgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, which created four bilateral working groups on priority areas of democracy; defense and security; economic, trade, energy issues, people-to-people and cultural exchanges.

The multi-year Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP) ended in 2004, achieving its intended goals of enhancing Georgia's military capability and stimulating military reform. Launched in January 2005, the Georgia Sustainment and Stability Operations Program has advanced GTEP's goals and trained the Georgian contingent participating in coalition operations in Iraq. Partnership with the Georgia (U.S.) National Guard, visits by the Sixth Fleet, the Coast Guard to Georgia, and the Bilateral Working Group on Defense and Military Cooperation are also important components of American security relationship with Georgia. Promoting democracy and reform is another strategic pillar of America's bilateral relationship with Georgia. In April 2006, as part of these reforms Georgia passed a strong anti-human trafficking law and has since then ranked consistently among Tier 1 countries of the State Department's report on trafficking in persons, meaning that the country now fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Georgia hosts 90 Peace Corps Volunteers who work in English Language Education and NGO Development. The Iraq War In a sign of Georgia's increased shift away from Russia and towards the West in the early 2000s, the country committed significant number of troops to U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, after wrapping up a smaller operation in the American-led peacekeeping mission in the war-torn Balkans. Georgia's contingent in Iraq originally consisted of 300 special forces troops under U.S. command in Baqouba, who guarded two bridges and three American Forward Operating Bases. 550 more troops were deployed in June 2005, which were placed under U.S. command on a dangerous 'Middle Ring Security' mission in the Green Zone.Press Releases, Statements & Transcripts - Embassy of the U.S. in Georgia In 2007, Georgia brought the total number of its troops in Iraq to 2000, becoming the third largest troop contributor after the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The troops, all of whom had been trained by American instructors, were based east of Baghdad, close to the border with Iran. During the outbreak of war between Georgia and Russia on August 8, 2008, Georgia was forced to pull its entire 2,000-strong contingent from Iraq to provide assistance back home. At the time of the withdrawal, five Georgian soldiers had died in Iraq and 19 were wounded.Online Magazine - Civil Georgia War in Afghanistan Georgia currently maintains 1600 soldiers in the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan, making it the largest per-capita contributor in the mission and the largest non-NATO contributor to the war effort, after overtaking Australia in 2012.

Following the defeat of Georgia's ruling UNM Coalition in the Georgian parliamentary elections of 2012, the new governing coalition has promised the United States to remain in Afghanistan and maintain presence there even after most of the coalition withdraws in 2014. Georgia has already started training Afghan security personnel on site and in Georgia. The country also plans to deploy to the area its helicopter instructors, who possess decades of experience with Soviet helicopters, similar to the kind Afghanistan will be using in the years to come. The virtually non-existent domestic opposition to Georgia's deployment in Afghanistan has not substantially increased despite increasing number of Georgian casualties.

Life At an early age he entered the Order of St. Dominic in his native town; he obtained, in 1590 the lectorate in theology and was at the same time appointed regent of studies in the convent of St. Paul at Valladolid. In 1594 he was assigned to the chair of theology in the university of that city. The intellectual atmosphere of the time was troubled, and theological discussion was rife. The controversy aroused in 1588 by the publication of Luis Molina's work Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, between the Dominicans and Jesuits, had reached a heated and turbulent stage not only at Valladolid but also at Salamanca, Cordoba, Zaragoza, and other cities of Spain. Disputations, both public and private, showed a tendency to drift away from the hitherto universally accepted teaching of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. In 1600 Lemos was chosen to represent his province in the public defence of selected theses before the general chapter of his order held at Naples. The propositions embraced the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas and his school on grace and free will. In his defence Lemos proved himself as a disputant. No deviation from the works of Augustine would pass him uncorrected; and that he was no less familiar with the writings of Aquinas is evident from his own words: :nec nos in Hispania aliis armis nisi armis S. Thomae incaepimus hanc doctrinam impugnare (Acta Congreg., disp. ii, col. 176). His success prompted the general of his order to send him to Rome to assist his confrere, Diego Alvarez, in defending the teaching of his order against the Molinists before the Congregatio de Auxiliis, established by Pope Clement VIII to settle the controversy. House of Tomas de Lemos Ribadavia, Ourense. In the Molinist controversy between Dominicans and Jesuits Lemos was given the responsibility, along with Diego √Ålvarez, of representing the Dominican Order in debates before Pope Clement VIII and Pope Paul V. Upon his arrival he was given first place in the defence, which he held till the termination of the Congregation (26 February 1606). For four years, in forty-seven public conferences, in the presence of Clement VIII and Pope Paul V, he defended the teaching of Aquinas with extraordinary skill against five adversaries, the √©lite of the great Jesuit theologians of the time. Referring to this event he himself writes: :Fuit ista Congregatio celebris, de qua multi mirati sunt, quod tot ac tantis, ubi fecerunt summum proelium patres Societatis, sic ex tempore fuisset responsum. Sed gratia Dei sum id quod sum (Acta Congreg,, 1231). At the conclusion of the commission, Pope Paul V and Philip III of Spain offered him a bishopric, but he declined the honour, preferring to remain in Rome in the convent Sopra Minerva to devote himself to literary work. Three years before his death he became totally blind. In 1610 Lemos was professor of theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum.Enciclopedia Treccani, http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tomas-de-lemos/ Accessed 25 May 2012 Works During his lifetime he published nothing. The work which has given him a place in the history of theology appeared about fifty years after his death, the \\"Panoplia gratia seu de rationalis creaturae in finem supernaturalem gratuita divina suavipotente ordinatione, ductu, mediis, liberoque progressu, dissertationes theologicae\\" (Li√®ge, 1676). The \\"Acta omnia Congregatioum et disputationum, quae coram SS. Clemente VIII et Panlo V Summis Pontificibus sunt celebratae in causa et controversia illa magna de auxiliis divinae gratiae\\" (Louvain, 1702) appeared nearly a hundred years after his death.

The first documented member of this name is Wilhelmus dictus Doys (1260) who died in the Battle of Worringen. Doys is mentioned in 1275 as being the owner of Castle Scate, then a fiefdom of the Counts (and later Dukes) of Cleves. Doys son Dietrich became the first person to use \\"de Bylandt\\" as his house name (1294). From then on all descendants used the name Bylandt. Following that period, the Bylandt family became steadily more powerful and acquired vast amounts of land. The title Marshal of the County of Cleves also stayed in the family for a long time. In 1500, the three cadet branches formed. The first branch, Bylandt-Well, became the owners of Gut in Geldern but soon died out. The second, Bylandt-Rheydt, inherited Rheydt, later calling themselves Baron of Rheydt, and gained control of much land, including land in Austria, the Netherlands and Germany.

He was a member of The Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour and the New English Art Club. Early life and education Dow was born 28 October 1848 at Dysart, Fife. He was educated for the law and was expected to follow his father and brother into the family law firm in Kirkcaldy. Deciding against a career in law, Dow went to Paris in 1877 and enrolled for classes at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. Later, in 1879 he registered with the ateliers of Rudolphe Julien and Carolus Duran. Of his earlier instruction in painting and drawing little is known except for the encouragement he received from his uncle Alexander Millie, an amateur artist. Two young men among the many young British and American students registered for classes in Paris in the late 1870s became Dow's particular friends. They were the Englishman William Stott of Oldham and the American Abbott Handerson Thayer. Both men were to remain important figures in Dow's personal and professional life and, as both had strong personalities and strong ideas about art, they came to exert a considerable influence over the artistic choices he made. Among other friends studying in Paris at the time were the Glasgow-based artists John Lavery, Alexander Roche, James Paterson and Alexander Mann. Work Dow painted in oils, watercolour and pastels. His subjects include flower studies, landscapes, portraits and decorative allegorical works. The geographical range of his landscapes extends through Scotland, the northeastern United States, Morocco, northern Italy and Cornwall. Using a subtly refined palette he chose to depict the quiet moods of nature. The subjects of his compositions range from the intense stillness of woodland to the calm before a storm at sea; and from dusk deepening on a northern shore to the lifting haze of a Mediterranean spring morning. From 1877 to 1879 Dow spent the winters in the Paris studios and making occasional sketching excursions with fellow students Mann, Paterson, and Bell, to the villages of Barbizon and Grez-sur-Loing in the Forest of Fontainebleau. Summers were spent painting in the towns and villages along the east coast of Scotland, travelling from Dysart through St Andrews and on up to Stonehaven, Cullen, Cowie, Collieston and Forvie Ness. Upon his return from Paris and based at home in Dysart records show Dow exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) in Edinburgh from 1878 and at the Royal Glasgow Institute of Fine Art (RGIFA) from 1879. However his letters to the Thayer family from this period reveal the degree of anxiety he felt about he direction his career should take. On 6 September 1883 Dow sailed on the \\"Devonia\\" from Glasgow to New York. From there he travelled up the Hudson River to the home of Abbott Thayer and his wife Kate Bloede at Cornwall-on-Hudson. (Thayer had built there a studio on land owned by the Stillman family.) Dow stayed in the US into the early summer of 1884. During these several months he produced what may be his best-known landscape, The Hudson River (Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow). It is a view of the river taken from the Thayer‚Äôs house. The US visit had re- invigorated Dow. His letters to Thayer between 1885‚Äì87 reveal his renewed enthusiasm for landscape. During this period he produced Ragweed and Crows (Hunterian, University of Glasgow), among other fine paintings. Dow traveled out of the city, south to Moniaive, for his first allegorical painting The Coming of Spring, and north for his study of birches, In a Wood at Forres , which was bought by Alexander Mann. He had begun a series of commissions, the first being Portrait of John Nairn ( Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery) and writes of working on a likeness in pastels of his sister Mary Lady in Black (private collection). Dow was at this time sharing the Glasgow studio of William York Macgregor and living with Mary and her husband Allan McLean, the lawyer, amateur painter and art collector. It is for the work completed between 1885 and 1895 that Dow is most closely associated with that group of artists who later became known as the Glasgow Boys. Dow is among the 21 Glasgow-based artists whose work is assessed in David Martin's contemporary account entitled The Glasgow School of Painting (George Bell & Sons 1897). In his piece on Dow Martin wrote as follows. \\"His perception of colour is similar to his use of paint ‚Äì keen and refined; and his observation of nature such as to give a true feeling of form, without a slavish imitation.\\" Clearly Dow's subject matter and technique appealed to Martin. And he draws attention to what others have found since in Dow's work, that is, his \\"faculty of placing on canvas the essence of the abstract qualities of his subject, with a fine decorative arrangement of line and colour masses, and, let the theme be an idyllic landscape or an imaginative figure-subject, he combines in a satisfactory result the ideal with the real\\".Martin, David The Glasgow School of Painting (1897) pp. 13‚Äì14. Though the Glasgow School grouping was \\"geographical in nature rather than stylistic\\" as Paul Harris makes clear in his introduction to the 1976 edition of Martin's account, it was to gain them a wider audience. Exhibitions at the Grosvenor Gallery and the Grafton Galleries in London led to invitations from Secession galleries in Vienna, Munich, Berlin in the 1890s and, later, to exhibitions in U.S. cities. Dow also joined the New English Art Club (NEAC) in 1887 and exhibited with them until 1891. Dow spent the summer of 1888 travelling in Switzerland and Germany painting in the mountains, some of the time in the company of William Stott. Stott's Portrait of Tom Dow is held in Edinburgh by the National Galleries of Scotland. He spent the winter/spring 88/89 in Morocco. Among his Tangier paintings is the pastel A Spring Day, Morocco (Kirkcaldy AG). Dow married Florence Pilcher (n√©e Cox) in 1891. Florence, a widow, had a boy and a girl from her first marriage. Dow‚Äôs own daughter Mary Rosamond was born in 1892. Two years later, in 1894, the family moved from Glasgow to St Ives, Cornwall where Dow joined his friends and fellow painters Louis Grier and Lowell Dyer as members of the St Ives Art Club.Grier, Louis The Studio Vol V (1895). See photograph \\"Some members\\" p. 111. Though living far from Glasgow, records show that Dow continued to exhibit there and in other cities in Scotland. Among his paintings shown at the RGIFA in 1892 were The Enchanted Wood (private collection) and, in 1894, The Herald of Winter 1894 (McManus Galleries Dundee). For several years from 1896 the Dows spent the winter months in Italy. His Italian paintings include several watercolours and pastels of Apennine valleys and villages and some well-known Venetian landmarks. For his larger pieces he continued to paint allegorical subjects: The Kelpie 1895 (whereabouts unknown), A Vision of Spring 1901 (Manchester Art Gallery), the triptych Eve 1904 (Walker Art Gallery), and Sirens of the North 1911 (McManus Galleries Dundee). Of the Cornish paintings his most frequent subject in both oils and pastels is the harbour at St Ives. This he depicts in contrasting moods, busy with boats in the sunshine and lying calm under a moonlit sky. Dow died on 3 July 1919 at St Ives, Cornwall, England and is buried at Zennor.

History  The U.S. Embassy suspended operations in Bissau on June 14, 1998, in the midst of violent conflict between forces loyal to then-President Vieira and the military-led junta. Prior to and following the embassy closure, the United States and Guinea- Bissau have enjoyed excellent bilateral relations. The U.S. recognized the independence of Guinea-Bissau on September 10, 1974. Guinea-Bissau's Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations was one of the first the new nation sent abroad. The U.S. opened an embassy in Bissau in 1976, and the first U.S. Ambassador presented credentials later that year. U.S. assistance began in 1975 with a $1 million grant to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees for resettlement of refugees returning to Guinea-Bissau and for 25 training grants at African technical schools for Guinean students. Emergency food was a major element in U.S. assistance to Guinea-Bissau in the first years after independence. Since 1975, the U.S. has provided more than $65 million in grant aid and other assistance. Since the 1998 war the U.S. has provided over $800,000 for humanitarian demining to a non-governmental organization (NGO) which has removed over 2,500 mines and 11,000 unexploded ordnance from the city of Bissau; $1.6 million in food aid; and nearly $3 million for assistance for refugees, improving the cashew industry, and promoting democracy. The United States and Guinea-Bissau signed an international military education and training (IMET) agreement in 1986, and prior to 1998, the U.S. provided English-language teaching facilities as well as communications and navigational equipment to support the navy's coastal surveillance program. The U.S. European Command's Humanitarian Assistance Program has assisted with $390,000 for constructing or repairing schools, health centers, and bridges. The Peace Corps withdrew from Guinea-Bissau in 1998 at the start of the civil war. In August 2004, sanctions under Section 508 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act‚Äîwhich were imposed as a result of the September 2003 military coup‚Äîwere lifted and Bissau once again became eligible for IMET and other direct aid. In March 2007, the U.S. and Brazil signed a Tripartite Memorandum of Understanding with Guinea-Bissau highlighting a parliamentary strengthening project first implemented in 2005. Principal U.S. Officials (resident in Dakar, Senegal) include: * Ambassador‚ÄîMarcia Bernicat * Deputy Chief of Mission--Jay T. Smith There is no U.S. Embassy in Bissau; likewise, Guinea-Bissau does not maintain any consulate-generals in the United States (except for its Permanent mission to the United Nations in New York). The U.S. Ambassador to Senegal, who resides in Dakar, is accredited as the U.S. Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau. All official U.S. contact with Guinea-Bissau is handled by the U.S. Embassy in Dakar, Senegal. Local employees staff the U.S. Liaison Office in Bissau, and American diplomats from the embassy in Dakar travel frequently to Bissau to conduct normal diplomatic relations.

Mayor of Constan»õa, Radu MazƒÉre, called him \\"an idiot\\" and said that he'll \\"break his legs\\" if Cernea comes to Constan»õa.

Same-sex civil unions Also in April 2013, Cernea announced that he intends to propose the legalization of civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.

After the place was hallowed, Cernea, who was studying philosophy at the University, together with three other students, wrote a letter of protest, organized a conference about the subject and gathered 150 signatures against the building of the church. The Association of Christian Orthodox students gathered a list of 3000 signatures supporting the building of the church.Cristian Ghinea, Ateii iconocla≈üti cu care a≈ü muri de g√Æt, Dilema Veche, February 16, 2007 As the scandal was booming, the rector decided to defuse it by banning any conference on the subject. The project of the building of the church was cancelled and the Orthodox icons in the University classrooms were removed. =Icons in schools= According to Cernea, following the fall of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, in schools, his portraits were replaced with Romanian Orthodox icons. In 2005, Emil Moise, a philosophy teacher from BuzƒÉu began a campaign against the display of religious items in schools.\\"C√¢teva ONG-uri cer retragerea icoanelor ≈üi crucilor din ≈ücoli\\", BBC, November 14, 2006 Cernea's association supported his case for the removal of icons from schools, arguing that the religious symbols represent a discrimination against non-Orthodox children and an infringement against the neutrality of the state. Additionally, as 90% of the schools held religious services, Cernea argued that this practice was also illegal, as the Romanian penal code bans forcing anyone to participate to any religious ceremony.√éPS Bartolomeu √Æi afurise≈üte pe du≈ümanii orelor de religie, AdevƒÉrul, October 24, 2006 The movement against icons in schools generated a large debate in the Romanian society and media. In CNCD Decision 323/2006, the National Council for Combating Discrimination ruled that the display of religious icons was discriminatory. However, the Ministry of Education argued that it cannot remove the icons because they were not the ones who put them there in the first place and that local communities should decide whether to keep the icons or not.\\"Eliminarea simbolurilor religioase din ≈ücoli\\", BBC, December 13, 2006 =Romanian People Salvation Cathedral= The Romanian People Salvation Cathedral is a large-scale cathedral construction project envisioned by the Romanian Orthodox Church. The government of Romania originally wanted the cathedral to be built it in the place of Carol Park, but following protests, including those organized by the Solidarity for Freedom of Conscience Association,\\"Utilajele Aedificia Carpati au intrat in Monumentul Eroilor Comunisti din Parcul Carol\\" in AdevƒÉrul, April 15, 2004 it changed the plans. Finally, in 2007, the state gave the Orthodox Church about 11 hectares of land in central Bucharest, next to the Palace of the Parliament and it promised it will pay partly the construction costs. Cernea argued that both the donation of the terrain and giving the additional funds represent a misuse of state funds and is illegal.\\"Punerea pietrei de temelie a Catedralei Neamului\\", BBC, November 28, 2007 The Solidarity for Freedom of Conscience Association also contested the name \\"Romanian People Salvation Cathedral\\", arguing that it has nationalistic overtones, by linking being Romanian to affiliation to the Orthodox Church. =School curriculum= In 2007, Cernea's association announced that the new curriculum of Romania had quietly removed the requirement of teaching Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution from biology textbooks, as well as the debate on the existence of God (the study of Voltaire, Camus and Nietzsche), from philosophy textbooks.\\"Darwin, exclus din manualele de biologie ?\\", BBC, October 9, 2007 Cernea argues that the current curriculum lacks the scientific and philosophical points of view, but in the same time, in religion classes, the seven-day creationism is taught, distorting the children's understanding of how the world came into being.\\"Romania removes theory of evolution from school curriculum\\", The Diplomat, December 2007 In February 2008, his association asked the Ministry of Education to re-introduce explicitly the theory of evolution in the biology curriculum, arguing that Romania is the only European country in which it is not studied in detail\\"Ce invatam la scoala? Doar ca ne-a facut Dumnezeu sau si ca ne tragem din maimuta?\\", hotnews.ro, February 26, 2008 and organized a protest in front of the headquarters of the Ministry of Education for the reintroduction of evolution in the curriculum.\\"Protest pentru reintroducerea evolu≈£ionismului √Æn ≈ücoalƒÉ\\", BBC, March 21, 2008 In a 2009 interview for Dilema Veche, Cernea says that there are not only textbooks that do not describe evolution, but there are some approved textbooks that teach creationism. He argues that the school curriculum is particularly important, since it influences the high school students' choice of university study and that this is why in Romania there's a huge number of those studying theology, with a dwindling number of students studying sciences.\\"√énvƒÉ≈£ƒÉm√Æntul rom√¢nesc ≈üi evolu≈£ia ‚Äì interviu cu Remus CERNEA, pre≈üedintele Asocia≈£iei Umaniste Rom√¢ne\\", Dilema Veche, March 12, 2009 =Other initiatives= In 2006, the association organized a concert against the new law regulating religion in Romania, which banned \\"religious defamation\\".

Cernea argued that this breaks the free and fair election standards found in Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters of the Council of Europe and that it would monopolize the elections to those \\"rich and corrupt\\". Prime Minister Emil Boc, however, announced that the law project would be dropped.\\"Cum se na≈üte un candidat la pre≈üedin≈£ie\\", Evenimentul Zilei, August 17, 2009 In May 2010, Remus Cernea is taking part, along with other high-ranking members from the Green Party at the GayFest, the annual gay pride festival of Bucharest.Partidul Verde din Rom√¢nia va participa la Mar≈üul DiversitƒÉ≈£ii din cadrul GayFest Books * Remus Cernea, Manifest √Æmpotriva becalizƒÉrii Rom√¢niei , Tritonic 2007 References External links * remuscernea.ro: Official site * Romanian Humanist Association *www.humanism.ro: Solidaritatea pentru libertatea de con≈ütiin≈£ƒÉ *\\"Manifest √Æmpotriva becalizƒÉrii Rom√¢niei\\", at Tritonic publishing house 1974 births Living people Politicians from Bucharest Romanian human rights activists Romanian environmentalists Romanian agnostics Romanian secularists Candidates for President of Romania Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) University of Bucharest alumni ","title":"Remus Cernea"},{"id":"15984896","text":"Guyana‚ÄìUnited States relations are the bilateral relations between the Co- operative Republic of Guyana and the United States of America.Jacqueline A.

During the last years of his administration, President Hoyte sought to improve relations with the United States as part of a decision to move his country toward genuine political nonalignment. Relations also were improved by Hoyte's efforts to respect human rights, invite international observers for the 1992 elections, and reform electoral laws. The United States also welcomed the Hoyte government's economic reform and efforts, which stimulated investment and growth. The 1992 democratic elections and Guyana's reaffirmation of sound economic policies and respect for human rights have benefited U.S.-Guyanese relations. Under successive PPP governments, the United States and Guyana continued to improve relations. President Cheddi Jagan was committed to democracy, adopted more free market policies, and pursued sustainable development for Guyana's environment. President Jagdeo is continuing on that course, and the United States maintains positive relations with the current government. In an effort to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in The Co-operative Republic of Guyana, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opened an office at the U.S. Embassy in 2002. In January 2003, The Cooperative Republic of Guyana was named as one of only two countries in the Western Hemisphere to be included in President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 79% of Haitians approve of U.S. leadership, with 18% disapproving and 3% uncertain, the highest rating for any surveyed country in the Americas.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup  Introduction  Because of Haiti's location, Haiti has the potential to affect the stability of the Caribbean and Latin America and is therefore strategically important to the United States. Historically, the United States viewed Haiti as a counterbalance to Communist Cuba. Haiti's potential as a trading partner and an actor in the drug trade makes the nation strategically important to the United States. Moreover, both nations are tied by a large Haitian diaspora residing in the United States.  History  = Haiti‚ÄìUnited States relations (1800‚Äì1914) = Then-U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and other Federalists supported Toussaint Louverture's revolution against France in Haiti, which had originated as a slave revolt. Hamilton's suggestions helped shape the Haitian constitution. In 1804 when Haiti became the Western Hemisphere's first independent state with a majority of the population being black, Hamilton urged closer economic and diplomatic ties. Hamilton and Timothy Pickering worked to convince John Adams to appoint Edward Stevens as the United States consul-general in Saint-Domingue (later Haiti) from 1799 to 1800. Adams sent Stevens to Haiti with instructions to establish a relationship with Toussaint and express support for his regime. The Federalist administration hoped to incite a movement toward Haitian independence, but Louverture maintained a colonial relationship with France. Stevens's title, \\"consul\\", suggested a diplomat attached to a country not a colony, reflecting the Adams administration's view of the Haitian situation. Following his arrival in Haiti in April 1799, Stevens succeeded in accomplishing several of his objectives, including: the suppression of privateers operating out of the colony, protections for American lives and property, and right of entry for American vessels. Stevens pushed for similar privileges for the British, who, like the United States (see Quasi-War) were engaged in war with France. Negotiations between Haiti and Britain were difficult given Haiti's fears of Britain's desire to take control of the colony, and Britain's fears of the Haitian slave revolt spreading to its own Caribbean colonies. In fact, Stevens had to serve as the British agent for a time since Haitian troops feared having a British official in the colony. The convention, signed on June 13, 1799, continued an armistice among the three parties, gave protections to British and American ships from privateers, and allowed American and British ships to enter the colony and engage in free trade. Following the Federalist Party's defeat in the 1800 United States presidential election, the United States under President Jefferson (a Virginia slaveowner who only supported manumission of African-Americans from slavery on the condition of voluntary removal to Africa) withdrew diplomatic recognition from Toussaint's autonomous government and worked to curry favors with the government of Napoleon Bonaparte. After Haiti gained its independence from France in 1804, the pro-slavery Southern US worried that would influence slaves in the US, and the U.S. refused to recognize Haiti's subsequent independence until 1862. President Andrew Johnson suggested annexing the island to secure influence over Europe in the Caribbean. The US government never followed through but posted active military on the island. In the 19th century, people who were mixed-race and blacks often entered into conflicts and called on foreign intervention. According to historian Hans Schmidt, the US Navy sent ships to Haiti 19 times between 1857 and 1913 to \\"protect American lives and property\\" until the United States finally occupied Haiti in 1915. One example of a US-Haiti conflict was the M√¥le Saint-Nicolas affair. = Occupations of Haiti by the United States (1915‚Äì1934) = From 1915 to 1934 the US Marines occupied Haiti. Prior to the occupation, the US military had taken control of the banks and collected $500,000 to hold in New York. The Haitian constitution was written in a manner that prevented foreign entities from owning land or operating in Haiti. However, as a result of the occupation, the US had influenced the Haitian government to rewrite the constitution to repeal an 1804 provision that forbade foreigners from owning land in Haiti. The occupation impacted the nation's economy as well as the people's self-image and independence. Ultimately, Haitians united in resistance of the US occupation, and US forces left in 1934. Left behind was a newly trained Haitian Army, the Garde, with mostly black soldiers and mulatto officers, who dominated political office until 1947. = US interventions in Haiti (1957‚Äì2005) = From 1957 to 1971, Francois Duvalier governed Haiti under a repressive dictatorship, but some argue the US tolerated the regime because it was staunchly anticommunist and a counterbalance to communist Cuba during the Cold War. When Duvalier died, his son, Jean-Claude (\\"Baby Doc\\") took over and maintained many of his father's policies. The Reagan administration forced Baby Doc to leave in 1986, and when a repressive military dictatorship arose, Reagan suspended aid. The George H.W. Bush administration also embargoed and then blockaded Haiti, suspending all but humanitarian aid. After the fall of the Duvalier family and other military regimes, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected in 1990, but he was toppled in a coup 7 months later. In 1993, the Clinton administration began to impose an economic blockade, which further impoverished the country, and in 1994, it eventually intervened militarily restore Aristide to power. US support for Aristide waned following concerns about his corruption, and a February 2004 armed rebellion led to his exile. After Ren√© Pr√©val succeeded Aristide, aid flowed again to Haiti, totaling $1.5 billion from 1990 to 2005. =Since 1994= Some policy experts argue that US policy and interventions have made problems in Haiti worse by making the country's well-being a US responsibility. US policy toward Haiti is officially intended to foster and strengthen democracy; help alleviate poverty, illiteracy, and malnutrition; promote respect for human rights; and counter illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US also supports and facilitates bilateral trade and investment along with legal migration and travel. US policy goals are met through direct bilateral action and by working with the international community. The US has taken a leading role in organizing international involvement with Haiti and works closely with the Organization of American States (OAS), particularly through its Secretary General's \\"Friends of Haiti\\" group (originally a UN group that included the US, Canada, France, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, which was enlarged in 2001 to add Germany, Spain, Norway, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and The Bahamas), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and individual countries to achieve policy goals. According to a 2005‚Äì2006 poll, 67 percent of Haitians would emigrate if they could, and 2 million people of Haitian descent live in the United States, 60 percent of whom are American-born. Four fifths of Haiti's college-educated citizens live outside Haiti. Following the January 2010 earthquake, the Department of Homeland Security temporarily stopped deportations of Haitians and granted Temporary Protected Status for 18 months for Haitian nationals. In 2010, US President Bill Clinton apologized for his role in demanding for Haiti to drop tariffs on the importation of subsidized US rice, which had a negative effect on Northern Haitian rice farmers. On May 24, 2010, the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) was signed into US law, ensuring preferential tariffs for Haitian-produced garments. On October 22, 2012, acting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave the keynote speech for the opening of the controversial Caracol industrial park. In 2011, WikiLeaks leaked info that showed the Obama administration fought to keep Haitian wages at 31 cents an hour when the Haiti government passed a law raising its minimum wage to 61 cents an hour. U.S. economic and development assistance to Haiti Haitian President Ren√© Pr√©val (left) and George W. Bush (right) at the Oval Office, White House in Washington, D.C., on May 08, 2007. Political insecurity and the failure of Haiti's governments to invest in developing the country's natural and human resources has contributed significantly to the country's current state of underdevelopment. U.S. efforts to strengthen democracy and help build the foundation for economic growth aim to rectify this condition. The U.S. has been Haiti's largest donor since 1973. Between FY 1995 and FY 2003, the U.S. contributed more than $850 million in assistance to Haiti. Since 2004, the U.S. has provided over $600 million for improving governance, security, the rule of law, economic recovery, and critical human needs. The President's budget request for FY 2007 was $198 million. U.S. Government funds have been used to support programs that have addressed a variety of problems. Some experts, however, have criticized the conditional nature of U.S. aid to Haiti. Often U.S. aid is provided based on conditions dictated by U.S. policy goals, not by Haitian institutions. This appears to be the case for some NGO programs funded under USAID. USAID also played a role in the eradication of the Creole pig, an important asset to small Haitian farmers, during the 1980s as part of an effort to combat an outbreak of the African swine fever virus. Haiti has been plagued for decades by extremely high unemployment and underemployment. The precipitous decline in urban assembly sector jobs, from a high of over 100,000 in 1986 to fewer than 20,000 in 2006, exacerbated the scarcity of jobs. To revitalize the economy, U.S. assistance attempts to create opportunities for stable sustainable employment for the growing population, particularly in rural areas. More recently, programs that help to increase commercial bank lending to micro-enterprises, especially in the agricultural sector, have helped to create a significant number of jobs. U.S. assistance is channeled primarily through private voluntary agencies and contractors to ensure efficient implementation of U.S. assistance programs. Combating Haitian drug trafficking Haiti is a major transshipment point for South American narcotics, primarily cocaine, being sent to the United States. To counter this threat, the U.S. has taken a number of steps, including vetting and training the counter narcotics division of the Haitian National Police, providing material assistance and training to the Haitian Coast Guard for drug and migrant interdiction, and obtaining the expulsion of several traffickers under indictment in the United States. U.S. response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake National Palace following the 2010 earthquake. The largest earthquake ever recorded in Haiti's history occurred on January 12, 2010 and registered 7.0 on the Richter scale. The quake centered 15 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince and caused catastrophic damage. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth H. Merten issued a disaster declaration and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) became the lead agency for the U.S. government's response to the disaster. USAID authorized $50,000 for the initial implementation of an emergency response program. The U.S. government also established an interagency task force to coordinate search and rescue efforts, logistics and infrastructure support, provision of assistance, and conducting needs assessments. Recent reporting suggests that some in-kind humanitarian aid from the United States has disrupted some of Haiti's internal markets, including the rice supply chain. Although the State Department and Defense Department have set aside $98.5 million to remove 1.2 million cubic yards of debris, efforts are hampered however by lack of equipment and resources On January 14 the Obama administration announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti to meet its immediate needs, in addition to pre-existing funding appropriated for Haiti. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) sent a 32-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART). =U.S. military response= U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) oversaw the Department of Defense's (DOD) response, and it deployed military assets in Operation United Response that supported U.S. and international assistance efforts. As of February 2010, DOD had 20,458 military personnel stationed in Haiti or in its waters. Twenty-six Navy and Coast Guard vessels, 68 helicopters, and over 50 fixed-wing aircraft assisted in the transportation of supplies, relief and rescue personnel, and casualties. U.S. Air Force Special Operations command personnel dispatched to Port-au-Prince within 24 hours of the earthquake and restored air traffic control capability and enabled airfield operations, provided immediate medical services, and conducted search and rescue missions. As of February 2010, DOD delivered 2.1 million bottled waters, 1.79 million food rations, more than 100,000 pounds of medical supplies, and more than 844,000 of bulk fuel. Additional tasks undertaken by DOD personnel include casualty treatment both ashore and afloat, aerial reconnaissance to assist rescue/supply efforts, the distribution of hand-held commercial radios, and the provision of radio broadcast capacity for emergency services information. Donald Trump's \\"shithole countries\\" comment On 11 January 2018, The Washington Post reported that, in a discussion on protecting immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, Donald Trump allegedly said, \\"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\\" Furthermore, he claimed that anyone trying to migrate from Haiti had AIDS and that they were \\"vectors of HIV.\\" After the report was released, Trump denied on Twitter that he used the term \\"shithole countries\\", but said that he used tough language in regards to the countries. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the United Nations condemned Trump's comment, describing it as \\"racist\\". Laurent Lamothe, the former Prime Minister of Haiti, also criticized Trump's comment. Following several days of riots over Trump's comments, the American embassy in Port-au-Prince was closed on 23 January 2018. U.S. business opportunities in Haiti Further opportunities for U.S. businesses include the development and trade of raw and processed agricultural products; medical supplies and equipment; rebuilding and modernizing Haiti's depleted infrastructure; developing tourism and allied sectors‚Äîincluding arts and crafts; and improving capacity in waste disposal, transportation, energy, telecommunications, and export assembly operations. Haiti's primary assembly sector inputs include textiles, electronics components, and packaging materials. Other U.S. export prospects include electronic machinery, including power-generation, sound and television equipment, plastics and paper, construction materials, plumbing fixtures, hardware, and lumber. Benefits for both Haitian and American importers and exporters are available under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA)--which provides for duty-free export of many Haitian products assembled from U.S. components or materials‚Äîthe successor program to the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and the HOPE Act, which provides additional duty-free preferences for qualifying apparel/textiles products and automotive wire harnesses. U.S. export opportunities also exist for four-wheel-drive vehicles, consumer electronics, rice, wheat, flour, animal and vegetable fats, meat, vegetables, and processed foodstuffs. The Government of Haiti seeks to reactivate and develop agricultural industries where Haiti enjoys comparative advantages, among which are essential oils, spices, fruits and vegetables, and sisal. The government encourages the inflow of new capital and technological innovations. Additional information on business opportunities in Haiti can be found at the Country Commercial Guide for Haiti. Establishing a U.S. business in Haiti Individuals wishing to practice a trade in Haiti must obtain an immigrant visa from a Haitian Consulate and, in most cases, a government work permit. Transient and resident traders must also have a professional ID card. Property restrictions still exist for foreign individuals. Property rights of foreigners are limited to 1.29 hectares in urban areas and 6.45 hectares in rural areas. No foreigner may own more than one residence in the same district, or own property or buildings near the border. To own real estate, authorization from the Ministry of Justice is necessary.

Adam Franz Lennig (3 December 1803 - 22 November 1866) was an ultramontane German Catholic theologian. He was born and died in Mainz. Life Lennig studied at Bruchsal under the private tutorship of the ex- Jesuit Laurentius Doller, and afterwards at the bishop's gymnasium at Mainz, his birthplace. Being too young for ordination, he went to Paris to study Oriental languages under Sylvestre de Sacy, then to Rome for a higher course in theology. Here he was ordained priest, 22 September 1827, and then taught for a year at Mainz. Lennig was a strenuous defender of the rights of the Roman Catholic Church, and when on 30 January 1830, the Government of the Grand Duchy of Hesse -- which for quite a time had been trying to interfere in church matters -- passed thirty-nine articles on ecclesiastical administration, he sent them to Rome. Rome sent back a protest, but, since the bishops remained silent, and since Joseph Vitus Burg, Bishop of Mainz, even defended the articles, Lennig left for Bonn, and attended the lectures of Johann Michael Sailer, Windischmann, and Klee. In June 1832, he accepted the pastorate of Gaulsheim, now part of Bingen am Rhein, declining to take the chair of theology and exegesis at Mainz. In 1839 he was made pastor at Seligenstadt. Petrus Leopold Kaiser, Bishop of Mainz, in 1845 promoted him to the cathedral chapter. As a mentor of the ultramontanism, he established in March 1848 the Piusverein (Pius Association). He organized the first Katholikentag (meeting of Catholic societies and of Catholics in general), held at Mainz, October 1848. In the same month he was present at the conference of the German Bishops at W√ºrzburg, acting as representative of his bishop who was ill. About this time he founded at great expense the Mainzer Journal. After the death of Bishop Kaiser (30 December 1848), troubles arose about the choice of a successor. Lennig was acknowledged by all as a leader of true Christian spirit and suffered much abuse from the Liberals. In 1852 he was made vicar general by Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler, and in 1856 dean of the chapter. He zealously assisted his bishop in bringing the Capuchins and Jesuits into the diocese. In 1854 he was in Rome at the definition of the Immaculate Conception, and later visited Rome twice. In 1859 he wrote a protest against the spoliation of the Holy See, and had it signed by 20,000 Catholics. He is buried at the Hauptfriedhof Mainz. His older brother, Friedrich Lennig, was a popular comic poet. Works Lennig published in 1849 his \\"Panegyric on Bishop Kaiser\\", and in 1862 his \\"Funeral Oration on the Archduchess Mathilde of Hesse\\". His meditations on the Passion and on the Our Father and Hail Mary were published 1867 and 1869 by his nephew, Christoph Moufang.

Diplomatic relations existed with the Pope, in his capacity as head of state of the Papal States, from 1848 under President James K. Polk to 1867 under President Andrew Johnson, though not at the ambassadorial level. These relations lapsed when on February 28, 1867 Congress passed legislation that prohibited any future funding of United States diplomatic missions to the Holy See. This decision was based on mounting anti-Catholic sentiment in the United States, fueled by the conviction and hanging of Mary Surratt, a Catholic, for taking part in the conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. Her son, John Surratt, also Catholic, was accused of plotting with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination. He was given sanctuary by the Roman Catholic Church and fled to Italy where he served as a Papal Zouave. There was also an allegation that the Pope had forbidden the celebration of Protestant religious services, previously held weekly in the home of the American Minister in Rome, within the walls of the city. =1867‚Äì1984= From 1867 to 1984, the United States did not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Several presidents designated personal envoys to visit the Holy See periodically for discussions of international humanitarian and political issues. Postmaster General James Farley was the first of these representatives. Farley was the first high ranking government official to normalize relations with the Holy See in 1933 when the Postmaster General set sail for Europe, along with Soviet Commissar of Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov on the Italian Liner . In Italy, Farley had an audience with Pope Pius XI, and dinner with Cardinal Pacelli, who was to succeed to the papacy in 1939. Myron Charles Taylor served Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman from 1939 to 1950.John S. Conway, \\"Myron C. Taylor's Mission to the Vatican 1940‚Äì1950.\\" Church History 44.1 (1975): 85-99. Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan also appointed personal envoys to the Pope. Also, all of these presidents, in addition to Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and all later presidents, along with the first ladies clad in black dresses and veils, have sought the papal blessing, typically during the first few months of their administrations, and usually traveling to the Vatican to do so.List of meetings between the Pope and the President of the United States On October 20, 1951, President Truman nominated former General Mark W. Clark to be the United States emissary to the Holy See. Clark later withdrew his nomination on January 13, 1952, following protests from Senator Tom Connally (D-TX) and Protestant groups. The official prohibition lasted until September 22, 1983, when it was repealed by the \\"Lugar Act\\". The Vatican has historically been accused of being un-American, at least until the presidency of John F. Kennedy (see Americanism (heresy), nativism and anti- Catholicism in the United States). The bulk of the accusation is found in Paul Blanshard's book American Freedom and Catholic Power, which attacked the Holy See on grounds that it was a dangerous, powerful, foreign and undemocratic institution. =1984‚Äìpresent= President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama meet with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican on 2009 Pope Francis and President Barack Obama at the White House in 2015. The United States and the Holy See announced the establishment of diplomatic relations on January 10, 1984. In sharp contrast to the long record of strong domestic opposition, this time there was very little opposition from Congress, the courts, and Protestant groups.Andrew M. Essig, and Jennifer L. Moore. \\"US-Holy See Diplomacy: The Establishment of Formal Relations, 1984.\\" Catholic Historical Review (2009) 95#4, pp. 741-764741-764. online On March 7, 1984, the Senate confirmed William A. Wilson as the first U.S. ambassador to the Holy See. Ambassador Wilson had been President Reagan's personal envoy to the Pope since 1981. The Holy See named Archbishop Pio Laghi as the first Apostolic Nuncio (equivalent to ambassador) of the Holy See to the U.S. Archbishop Laghi had been Pope John Paul II's apostolic delegate to the Catholic Church in the United States since 1980. Relations between President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II were close especially because of their shared anti-communism and keen interest in forcing the Soviets out of Poland.Marie Gayte, \\"The Vatican and the Reagan Administration: A Cold War Alliance?.\\" Catholic Historical Review (2011) 97#4 pp. 713-736 online Also, the two men forged a common bond over having survived assassination attempts just six weeks apart in the spring of 1981. Following the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the US war on terrorism from 2001, the Vatican has been critical of the war on terrorism in general, and particularly critical of the US policies in Iraq. On July 10, 2009, President Barack Obama and Pope Benedict XVI met in Rome. A planned relocation of the U.S. embassy to the Holy See to the same location as the U.S. embassy to Italy drew criticism from several former U.S. ambassadors. On March 27, 2014, Obama and Pope Francis met in Rome; this was followed by Pope Francis's 2015 visit to North America in September 2015, where, after visiting Cuba, he came to the U.S., and participated in the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia, and also visited Washington, D.C., and New York City.

Weinstein (July 8, 1912 ‚Äì November 30, 2007 Pembroke Pines, Broward County, Florida) was an American lawyer and politician. Name He was born Morris Weinstein without middle initial. A playbill for a production at Brooklyn College added erroneously the middle initial, and a mistaken inscription of his degree at Brooklyn Law School changed Morris to Moses which name he adopted henceforth. Life He was born on July 8, 1912, in New York City, the son of a tailor, and grew up on the Lower East Side, Manhattan. He grad uated from Thomas Jefferson High School at 15, but it took him seven years and a dozen jobs to work his way through college and law school. In 1941, he married Muriel Marshall (d. 2006). They had three sons who all graduated from Brooklyn Law School too: Jeremy Weinstein, a New York Supreme Court justice and State Senator; Jonathan Weinstein; and Peter Weinstein, a Circuit Court judge in Broward County, Fla. In World War II, he was an infantry corporal and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1959 to 1969, sitting in the 172nd, 173rd, 174th, 175th, 176th, 177th and 178th New York State Legislatures. He was Majority Leader from 1965 to 1968, and as such became Acting Speaker for the remainder of the year upon the resignation of Speaker Anthony J. Travia after the close of the legislative session in 1968. He was Chairman of the Queens Democratic Party from 1962 to 1969, and was Majority Leader of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967. In August 1968, Weinstein, who as Acting Speaker was fourth in line for the governorship, became Acting Governor of New York for 10 days when Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Lieutenant Governor Malcolm Wilson and Temporary President of the Senate Earl W. Brydges went to the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. Weinstein was an ally of Mayor of New York Robert F. Wagner in the early 1960s and had a good relationship with Governor Rockefeller. Weinstein sponsored measures that created the Urban Development Corporation and the Crime Victims Compensation Board, reformed divorce and welfare laws, established a consumer bill of rights, increased aid for air-pollution controls and Regents scholarships, and promoted hospital expansion. He supported rent controls, veterans rights, aid to small businesses and antidiscrimination laws. In November 1969, he was elected to the New York Supreme Court. In a 1973 case, acknowledging he might be violating the law, he vacated the three-year term of a woman convicted of selling drugs, noting that she had terminal cancer and less than a year to live. In 1980, he was appointed to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department, with jurisdiction over Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and seven suburban counties. He participated in rulings that threw out unjust convictions, invalidated school financing based on property taxes and decided many other controversies. He left the bench at the end of 1988 after reaching the constitutional age limit. He died on November 30, 2007, in Memorial Hospital in Pembroke Pines, Broward County, Florida.

There is close cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the areas of the War on Drugs while the National Port Authority in Puerto Cort√©s is part of the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection's Container Security Initiative. During the 1980s, Honduras supported U.S. policy opposing governments in Nicaragua and opposing an active insurgency in El Salvador. In June 2005, Honduras became the first country in the hemisphere to sign a Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) compact with the US Government. Honduras failed the corruption indicator required for continued funding into 2008. MCC will closely follow Honduras's progress on reducing corruption under an approved \\"remediation plan.\\" The United States recognized President Manuel Zelaya, ousted from power in the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat, as the only constitutional president of Honduras. \\"We believe that the coup was not legal and that President Zelaya remains the democratically elected president there,\\" US President Barack Obama said.Leaders from Obama to Chavez blast Honduras coup Although U.S. officials have characterized the events as a coup, suspended joint military operations and all non-emergency, non-immigrant visas, and cut off certain non-humanitarian aid to Honduras, they have held back from formally designating Zelaya's ouster as a \\"military coup\\", which would require them to cut off almost all aid to Honduras. The United States subsequently warned the Micheletti government that it might not recognize the results of the November 29 elections if Zelaya was not allowed to return to power first, and ultimately indicated that the November election would not be recognized, persuading the Micheletti regime to refer Zelaya's return to the Honduran Congress. The United States maintains a presence at the Soto Cano Air Base in Comayagua; the two countries conduct joint peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, humanitarian, disaster relief, and civic action exercises. U.S. troops conduct and provide logistics support for a variety of bilateral and multilateral exercises‚Äîmedical, engineering, peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, and disaster relief. Trade In 2004, the United States signed the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic. The legislatures of all signatories except Costa Rica ratified CAFTA in 2005, and the agreement entered into force in the first half of 2006. CAFTA eliminates tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods, services, agricultural products, and investments. Additionally, CAFTA is expected to solidify democracy, encourage greater regional integration, and provide safeguards for environmental protection and labor rights. Bilateral trade between the two nations totaled $7.4 billion in 2006, up from $7 billion in 2005. Exports of goods and services from the U.S. increased from $3.24 billion in 2005 to $3.69 billion in 2006, while Honduran exports to the U.S. fell slightly from $3.75 billion in 2005 to $3.72 billion in 2006 More than 150 American companies operate in Honduras; U.S. franchises are present in increasing numbers. U.S.-Honduran trade is dominated by the Honduran maquila industry, which imports yarn and textiles from the United States and exports finished articles of clothing. Other leading Honduran exports to the United States include coffee, bananas, seafood (particularly shrimp), minerals (including zinc, lead, gold, and silver), and other fruits and vegetables. Two-way trade with Honduras in 2006 was $7.4 billion, up from $7.0 billion in 2005. For 2007 through October, Honduran exports to the United States increased 6%, and U.S. exports to Honduras increased 18% when compared to the same period in 2006. U.S. investors account for nearly two-thirds of the foreign direct investment (FDI) in Honduras. The stock of U.S. direct investment in Honduras in 2005 was $402 million, up from $339 million in 2004. The overall flow of FDI into Honduras in 2005 totaled $568 million, $196 million of which was spent in the maquila sector. The United States continued as the largest contributor of FDI. The most substantial U.S. investments in Honduras are in the maquila sector, fruit production (particularly bananas, melons, and pineapple), tourism, energy generation, shrimp aquaculture, animal feed production, telecommunications, fuel distribution, cigar manufacturing, insurance, brewing, leasing, food processing, and furniture manufacturing. Many U.S. franchises, particularly in the restaurant sector, operate in Honduras.  Assistance  The USAID budget for Honduras is $37 million for fiscal year 2007. Hurricane Mitch in 1998 left hundreds of thousands homeless, devastated the road network and other public infrastructure, and crippled certain key sectors of the economy, causing more than $3 billion in damages to homes, hospitals, schools, roads, farms, and businesses. The United States provided more than $461 million in immediate disaster relief and humanitarian aid spread over the years 1998-2001. The Peace Corps has been active in Honduras since 1962, and currently the program is one of the largest in the world. In 2005, there were 220 Peace Corps Volunteers working in the country. The role of the Honduran armed forces has changed significantly in recent years as many institutions formerly controlled by the military are now under civilian authority. The annual defense and police budgets have hovered at around $35 million during the past few years. Honduras receives modest U.S. security assistance funds and training. In the absence of a large security assistance program, defense cooperation has taken the form of increased participation by the Honduran armed forces in military-to-military contact programs and bilateral and multilateral combined exercises oriented toward peacekeeping, disaster relief, humanitarian/civic assistance, and counternarcotics. The U.S. Joint Task Force Bravo (JTF-B), stationed at the Honduran Soto Cano Air Base, plays a vital role in supporting combined exercises in Honduras and in neighboring Central American countries. JTF-Bravo plays a critical role in helping the United States respond to natural disasters in Central America by serving as a platform for rescue missions, repairing critical infrastructure, and in meeting high priority health and sanitation needs. JTF-Bravo forces have helped deliver millions of dollars worth of privately donated goods to those in need. Political involvement The Obama Administration's attempts to pressure Honduras into reversing the removal of Zelaya in 2009 were complicated by Republican minority party efforts to reach out to and advocate on behalf of the Roberto Micheletti government, as well as by a recent Republican-commissioned report by US Law Library of Congress that supports the constitutionality of Zelaya's removal from office, while condemning his expatriation. In turn, the Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate foreign relations committees asked the Law Library of Congress to retract the report, charging that it \\"contains factual errors and is based on a flawed legal analysis that has been refuted by experts from the United States, the Organization of American States and Honduras.\\" Opinion poll of how Hondurans see Americans According to a global opinion poll, 81% of Hondurans viewed the U.S. positively in 2002.Opinion of the United States Pew Research Center According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 38% of Hondurans approved of U.S. leadership, with 13% disapproving and 49% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup By 2016, the U.S. Global Leadership Report showed approval numbers had increased to 56%, but disapproval had also increased to 32%, with the percentage unsure or who refused dropping to 12%.

In the mid 1980s a group of contributors left Gƒ±rgƒ±r and established another humor magazine, Limon. Shortly after that another group from the magazine founded Hibir. In 1989, the magazine was taken over by a large publishing group, and Oƒüuz Aral and other key staff members left. Following this circulation declined rapidly, and Gƒ±rgƒ±r finally folded in 1993.

It specialises in the application of information, communication and technology (Information Communication Technology) solutions, software development, and project management.  Background  In 1997 AIMS was established under the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in Islamabad, Pakistan, to serve the information management needs of Afghanistan. In 2001, it was relocated to Kabul and became a project of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Since its inception, AIMS has served the Government of Afghanistan, non-governmental organizations and the international donor community as a provider of information management services including the development of software applications, database solutions, geospatial information and maps. AIMS is located in a new office facility in Kabul, and in 2002 AIMS established offices in five regional centers: Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Kunduz.

With the advent and popularity of the Internet, there is a need to develop algorithms that do not require any centralized control that have some guarantee of always working correctly. The Byzantine agreement protocol is an essential part of this task. In this article the quantum version of the Byzantine protocol, which works in constant time is described. Introduction The Byzantine Agreement protocol is a protocol in distributed computing. It takes its name from a problem formulated by Lamport, Shostak and Pease in 1982, which itself is a reference to a historical problem. The Byzantine army was divided into divisions with each division being led by a General with the following properties: *Each General is either loyal or a traitor to the Byzantine state. *All Generals communicate by sending and receiving messages. *There are only two commands: attack and retreat. *All loyal Generals should agree on the same plan of action: attack or retreat. *A small linear fraction of bad Generals should not cause the protocol to fail (less than a \\\\tfrac{1}{3} fraction). (See for the proof of the impossibility result). The problem usually is equivalently restated in the form of a commanding General and loyal Lieutenants with the General being either loyal or a traitor and the same for the Lieutenants with the following properties. *All loyal Lieutenants carry out the same order. *If the commanding General is loyal, all loyal Lieutenants obey the order that he sends. *A strictly less than \\\\tfrac{1}{3} fraction including the commanding General are traitors. Byzantine failure and resilience Failures in an algorithm or protocol can be categorized into three main types: # A failure to take another execution step in the algorithm: This is usually referred to as a \\"fail stop\\" fault. # A random failure to execute correctly: This is called a \\"random fault\\" or \\"random Byzantine\\" fault. # An arbitrary failure where the algorithm fails to execute the steps correctly (usually in a clever way by some adversary to make the whole algorithm fail) which also encompasses the previous two types of faults; this is called a \\"Byzantine fault\\". A Byzantine resilient or Byzantine fault tolerant protocol or algorithm is an algorithm that is robust to all the kinds of failures mentioned above. For example, given a space shuttle with multiple redundant processors, if the processors give conflicting data, which processors or sets of processors should be believed? The solution can be formulated as a Byzantine fault tolerant protocol. Sketch of the algorithm We will sketch here the asynchronous algorithm The algorithm works in two phases: *Phase 1 (Communication phase): :All messages are sent and received in this round. :A coin flipping protocol is a procedure that allows two parties A and B that do not trust each other to toss a coin to win a particular object. There are two types of coin flipping protocols * weak coin flipping protocols: The two players A and B initially start with no inputs and they are to compute some value c_{A},c_{B} \\\\in [0,1] and be able to accuse anyone of cheating. The protocol is successful if A and B agree on the outcome. The outcome 0 is defined as A winning and 1 as B winning. The protocol has the following properties: **If both players are honest (they follow the protocol), then they agree on the outcome of the protocol c_{A} = c_{B} with Pr(c_{A} = c_{B} = b) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} for a,b \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}. **If one of the players is honest (i.e., the other player may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol in his or her local computation), then the other party wins with probability at most \\\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\\\epsilon. In other words, if B is dishonest, then Pr(c_{A} = c_{B} = 1) \\\\leq \\\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\\\epsilon, and if A is dishonest, then Pr(c_{A} = c_{B} = 0)\\\\leq \\\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\\\epsilon . * A strong coin flipping protocol: In a strong coin flipping protocol, the goal is instead to produce a random bit which is biased away from any particular value 0 or 1. Clearly, any strong coin flipping protocol with bias \\\\epsilon leads to weak coin flipping with the same bias. =Verifiable secret sharing= * A verifiable secret sharing protocol: A (n,k) secret sharing protocol allows a set of n players to share a secret, s such that only a quorum of k or more players can discover the secret. The player sharing (distributing the secret pieces) the secret is usually referred to as the dealer. A verifiable secret sharing protocol differs from a basic secret sharing protocol in that players can verify that their shares are consistent even in the presence of a malicious dealer. =The fail-stop protocol= Protocol quantum coin flip for player P_i #Round 1 generate the GHZ state |\\\\mathrm{Coin}_i\\\\rangle =\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}|0,0,\\\\ldots,0\\\\rangle + \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}|1,1,\\\\ldots,1\\\\rangle on n qubits and send the kth qubit to the kth player keeping one part # Generate the state |\\\\mathrm{Leader}_i\\\\rangle= \\\\tfrac{1}{n^{3/2}}\\\\sum olimits_{a=1}^{n^3}|a,a,\\\\ldots,a\\\\rangle on n qubits, an equal superposition of the numbers between 1 and n^3. Distribute the n qubits between all the players # Receive the quantum messages from all players and wait for the next communication round, thus forcing the adversary to choose which messages were passed. # Round 2: Measure (in the standard base) all \\\\mathrm{Leader}_{j} qubits received in round I. Select the player with the highest leader value (ties broken arbitrarily) as the \\"leader\\" of the round. Measure the leader‚Äôs coin in the standard base. # Set the output of the QuantumCoinFlip protocol: v_{i} = measurement outcome of the leader‚Äôs coin. =The Byzantine protocol= To generate a random coin assign an integer in the range [0,n-1] to each player and each player is not allowed to choose its own random ID as each player P_k selects a random number s{_{k}^{i}} for every other player P_{i} and distributes this using a verifiable secret sharing scheme. At the end of this phase players agree on which secrets were properly shared, the secrets are then opened and each player P_i is assigned the value : s_i =\\\\sum \\\\, {s_{k}^{i}}{\\\\text{for all secrets properly shared}}\\\\mod n This requires private information channels so we replace the random secrets by the superposition |\\\\phi\\\\rangle =\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}\\\\sum olimits_{a=0}^{n-1}|a\\\\rangle. In which the state is encoded using a quantum verifiable secret sharing protocol (QVSS). We cannot distribute the state |\\\\phi,\\\\phi,\\\\ldots \\\\phi\\\\rangle since the bad players can collapse the state. To prevent bad players from doing so we encode the state using the Quantum verifiable secret sharing (QVSS) and send each player their share of the secret. Here again the verification requires Byzantine Agreement, but replacing the agreement by the grade-cast protocol is enough. Grade- cast protocol A grade-cast protocol has the following properties using the definitions in Informally, a graded broadcast protocol is a protocol with a designated player called ‚Äúdealer‚Äù (the one who broadcasts) such that: # If the dealer is good, all the players get the same message. # Even if the dealer is bad, if some good player accepts the message, all the good players get the same message (but they may or may not accept it). A protocol P is said to be achieve graded broadcast if, at the beginning of the protocol, a designated player D (called the dealer) holds a value v, and at the end of the protocol, every player P_{i} outputs a pair (\\\\mathrm{value}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{i}) such that the following properties hold: (\\\\forall i, \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{i} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2\\\\\\\\}) #If D is honest, then \\\\mathrm{value}_{i} = v and \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{i} = 2 for every honest player P_i. # For any two honest players P_{i} and P_{j}, \\\\vert \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{i} - \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{j}\\\\vert \\\\leq 1 . # (Consistency) For any two honest players P_{i} and P_{j}, if \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{i}> 0 and \\\\mathrm{confidence}_{j}> 0 , then \\\\mathrm{value}_{i}= \\\\mathrm{value}_{j}. For t < \\\\tfrac{n}{4} the verification stage of the QVSS protocol guarantees that for a good dealer the correct state will be encoded, and that for any, possibly faulty dealer, some particular state will be recovered during the recovery stage. We note that for the purpose of our Byzantine quantum coin flip protocol the recovery stage is much simpler. Each player measures his share of the QVSS and sends the classical value to all other players. The verification stage guarantees, with high probability, that in the presence of up to t < \\\\tfrac{n}{4} faulty players all the good players will recover the same classical value (which is the same value that would result from a direct measurement of the encoded state).  Remarks  In 2007, a quantum protocol for Byzantine Agreement was demonstrated experimentally using a four-photon polarization-entangled state. This shows that the quantum implementation of classical Byzantine Agreement protocols is indeed feasible.

Her work is represented in many permanent collections, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the British Library, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, United Kingdom and The Library of Congress in Washington. Her work also hangs in private, public and corporate collections in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Life Howard was born in Long Branch, Ontario, in 1926, the younger of two children. Her father, Thomas Howard, a secondary school teacher, was an English immigrant. Her mother, Helen Mackintosh, who was born in Winnipeg, was of Scottish ancestry. Having decided early to become an artist, Howard studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto from 1948 to 1951, where she was a pupil of Will Ogilvie, who taught her figure drawing, and Jock Macdonald, who taught her painting and composition. In her final year she won the silver medal in drawing and painting. Howard taught art classes in Toronto until 1953, when she moved to London in the UK, where she studied at Saint Martin's School of Art, immersing herself in the English landscape and the cultural life of postwar London. She also travelled to Europe to visit the art museums of Rome, Venice, Florence, Paris and Madrid, and saw the Paleolithic cave paintings at Lascaux in southwestern France, an experience which influenced many of her later illustrations. In London she met her future husband, the Canadian poet, Richard Outram. Returning to Canada in 1956, Howard and Outram made their home in Toronto for the next 46 years. In the late 1950s and early sixties Howard showed regularly at the Picture Loan Society, a Toronto gallery established by Douglas Duncan in 1936 to present the work of contemporary Canadian artists such as Emily Carr, Fred Varley, David Milne, Lawren Harris and A.Y. Jackson. Several Canadian public collections possess Howard drawings and paintings acquired through the Douglas Duncan estate, as Duncan was also a collector of her work.' In 2002, Howard and Outram moved to Port Hope, Ontario, but soon after their arrival Howard fell and broke her hip. While undergoing surgery on 7 December in Peterborough, Ontario, she suffered a pulmonary embolism and died on the operating table. Work Wood engraving by Howard for the Gauntlet Press, 1977 Howard and her husband were part of a circle of artists, writers and designers who were interested in visual images, in language and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text. In 1960 Howard and Outram launched the Gauntlet Press, a small private press which produced hand-bound letterpress volumes of Outram's poetry and Howard's wood engravings. These limited editions, prized by collectors, can also be found in such public collections as Library and Archives Canada, the Library of Congress, the British Library and the University of Toronto Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the Gauntlet Press also issued a series of letterpress broadsheets of Outram's poems, all of them designed (and many illustrated) by Howard. Digital facsimiles of the books and broadsheets of the Gauntlet Press in the collection of the Memorial University of Newfoundland can be viewed at the website dedicated to The Gauntlet Press of Richard Outram and Barbara Howard, together with extensive background material and an exhaustive bibliography. Imagery derived from the natural world was always at the heart of Howard's painting. Throughout her life she painted horizons, shorelines, skies, sun and water, although she was more concerned with the essence of a subject than with its precise representation. Engraving, book design and binding by Howard for the Gauntlet Press, 1974 In her sixties she devoted a decade of work to an extensive series of cetacean studies, Encounters with Whales. In his essay Encounters and Recollections in the Art of Barbara Howard and Richard Outram, the poet Jeffery Donaldson writes: \\"For the most part, these are portraits of the mammals in something like their private element. Their appearances are brief, ecstatic revelations, fortuitous glimpses, sudden soundings. They seem to break forth abruptly from their solitude and then slip away as quickly again.\\" These enormous canvases, some as large as across, have never been publicly exhibited. In the late 1990s until her death in 2002, Howard returned to her lifelong fascination with light, night skies, the reflective surface of water. In these last paintings, there is a recurrence of circular elements, an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light. Howard has stated: \\"In my painting (as in all my work) I am deeply involved with light as the movement and inter- action of colours; the integrity of colour and form, hence with the integrity of the total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence, not representation. I am preoccupied with life's ambiguities and dualities and in my later work I am reaching more and more from the dark toward light, freedom, and a transcending exuberance.\\" Howard's paintings, drawings, wood engravings and book designs can be viewed on the website Barbara Howard's Unfolding Visual World. Critical reception With the exception of the very large whale canvases, Howard's paintings sold steadily throughout her lifetime. However, while she had her champions, she was never a part of the mainstream of Canadian art and so did not attract the kind of public critical attention that attends most successful careers. In her introduction to the catalogue for Howard's 1980 solo exhibition The Event in the Mind, sculptor Rebecca Sisler wrote: > Classification, school? Barbara Howard's work defies specific slotting, > although we sense her recognition of the heritage left by great masters, > Turner being the most obvious. But she draws and paints in direct response > to her own muse and as such cannot be aligned to any particular art movement > ... ... for in common with other maverick artists throughout art history, > her work, although bound to no age, is relevant to all. Writing about Howard's wood engravings in her 2006 essay Drawing Attention: Barbara Howard's Ecologies, the artist, curator and academic Martha Fleming states: > Wood engraving is a demanding process, and Howard was a virtuoso. [The > creatures she portrayed] echo the floating, frameless engravings pioneered > by Thomas Bewick in the 18th century, and yet they are startlingly modern. > As much about form as they are about anatomical accuracy, they hover at the > brink of typology but have nothing of zoological rendering's reduction to > taxonomy. Her counterintuitive use of colour upholds the monochrome dignity > inherent in the technique. Howard was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1975 and served on the RCA Council from 1980 to 1982.

Lezana was an authority on canon law, dogmatic theology, and philosophy; his historical works are not of the same standard. Life Lezana was born at Madrid. He took the habit at Alberca, in Old Castile, on 18 October 1600, and made his profession at the house of the Carmelites of the Old Observance, at Madrid, in 1602. He studied philosophy at Toledo, theology at Salamanca, partly at the college of the order, partly at the university under Juan Marquez, and finally at Alcal√° under Luis de Montesion. For some years he was employed as lecturer at Toledo and Alcal√°, but having been sent to the general chapter of 1625 as delegate of his province, he remained in Rome as professor of theology. At the following chapter (1645), at which he assisted in the quality of titular provincial of Palestine, he obtained some votes for the generalship, but remaining in the minority he was nominated assistant general; for some years he also filled the office of procurator general. In addition to these dignities within the order, he filled for sixteen years the chair of metaphysics at the Sapienza and became consultor to the Congregation of the Index under Pope Urban VIII, and to that of Rites under Pope Innocent X. Appointed to a bishopric, he requested a nun to recommend an important matter (the nature of which he did not disclose) to Our Lord in prayer, and received through her the answer, which he acted upon, that it would be more perfect for him to refuse the dignity. He died in Rome. Works His \\"Annals of the Carmelite Order\\" (four folio vols.) were published between 1645 and 1656, and there remained another volume in manuscript.

The book's protagonist is the na√Øve drifter Alice, who squats with a group of radicals in London and is drawn into their terrorist activities. Lessing was spurred to write The Good Terrorist by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She had been a member of the British Communist Party, but left after the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Some reviewers labelled the novel a satire, while Lessing called it humorous. The title is an oxymoron which highlights Alice's ambivalent nature. The Good Terrorist divided reviewers. Some praised its insight and characterisation, others faulted its style and the characters' lack of depth. One critic complimented Lessing's \\"strong descriptive prose and her precise and realistic characterisations\\", another her \\"brilliant account of the types of individuals who commit terrorist acts\\", yet another called it \\"surprisingly bland\\", and the characters \\"trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions\\". The Good Terrorist was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and won the Mondello Prize and the WH Smith Literary Award. Plot summary The Good Terrorist is written in the subjective third person from the point of view of Alice, an unemployed politics and economics graduate in her mid-thirties who drifts from commune to commune. She is trailed by Jasper, a graduate she took in at a student commune she lived in fifteen years previously, who sponges off her. Alice fell in love with him, only to become frustrated by his aloofness and burgeoning homosexuality. She considers herself a revolutionary, fighting against \\"fascist imperialism\\", but is still dependent on her parents, whom she treats with contempt. In the early 1980s, Alice joins a squat of like-minded \\"comrades\\" in a derelict house in London. Other members of the squat include Bert, its ineffective leader, and a lesbian couple, the maternal Roberta and her unstable and fragile partner Faye. The abandoned house is in a state of disrepair and earmarked by the City Council for demolition. In the face of the indifference of her comrades, Alice takes it upon herself to clean up and renovate the house. She also persuades the authorities to restore the electricity and water supplies. Alice becomes the house's \\"mother\\", cooking for everyone, and dealing with the local police, who are trying to evict them. The members of the squat belong to the Communist Centre Union (CCU), and attend demonstrations and pickets. Alice involves herself in some of these activities, but spends most of her time working on the house. To be more useful to the struggle, Jasper and Bert travel to Ireland and the Soviet Union to offer their services to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the KGB, but are turned down. A more organised group of revolutionaries moves in next door and start using Alice's house as a conduit for arms, to which Alice objects. Mysterious strangers visit the squat and question their decision making. The comrades eventually decide to act on their own, calling themselves \\"Freeborn British Communists\\". They start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb. Alice does not fully support this action, but accepts the majority decision. They target an upmarket hotel in Knightsbridge, but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb, which kills Faye and several passers-by. The remaining comrades, shaken by what they have done, decide to leave the squat and split up. Alice, disillusioned by Jasper, chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house into which she has poured so much effort. Despite her initial reservations about the bombing, Alice feels a need to justify their actions to others, but realises it would be fruitless because \\"[o]rdinary people simply didn't understand\\". She acknowledges that she is a terrorist now, though she cannot remember when the change happened. Background Doris Lessing speaking at a alt=A head-and- shoulders photograph of an elderly woman Doris Lessing's interest in politics began in the 1940s while she was living in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). She was attracted to a group of \\"quasi-Communist[s]\\" and joined the chapter of the Left Book Club in Salisbury (now Harare). Later, prompted by the conflicts arising from racial segregation prominent in Rhodesia at the time, she also joined the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party. Lessing moved to London in 1949 and began her writing career there. She became a member of the British Communist Party in the early 1950s, and was an active campaigner against the use of nuclear weapons. By 1964, Lessing had published six novels, but grew disillusioned with Communism following the 1956 Hungarian uprising and, after reading The Sufis by Idries Shah, turned her attention to Sufism, an Islamic belief system. This prompted her to write her five-volume \\"space fiction\\" series, Canopus in Argos: Archives, which drew on Sufi concepts. The series was not well received by some of her readers, who felt she had abandoned her \\"rational worldview\\". The Good Terrorist was Lessing's first book to be published after the Canopus in Argos series, which prompted several retorts from reviewers, including, \\"Lessing has returned to Earth\\", and \\"Lessing returns to reality\\". Several commentators have labelled The Good Terrorist as a satire, while Lessing called it humorous. She said: > [I]t's not a book with a political statement. It's ... about a certain kind > of political person, a kind of self-styled revolutionary that can only be > produced by affluent societies. There's a great deal of playacting that I > don't think you'd find in extreme left revolutionaries in societies where > they have an immediate challenge. Lessing said she was inspired to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, \\"the media reported it to sound as if it was the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?\\" and realised \\"how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group.\\" Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: \\"I know several people like Alice‚Äîthis mixture of ... maternal caring, ... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother.\\" She described Alice as \\"quietly comic[al]\\" because she is so full of contradictions. She said she was surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, who turned out to be a \\"destroyed person\\". Genre The Good Terrorist has been labelled a \\"political novel\\" by the publishers and some reviewers, including Alison Lurie in The New York Review of Books. Lurie stated that as political fiction, it is \\"one of the best novels ... about the terrorist mentality\\" since Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (1907), although this was questioned by William H. Pritchard in The Hudson Review, who wrote that compared to Conrad, The Good Terrorist is \\"shapeless\\". Several commentators have called it more a novel about politics than political fiction. In From the Margins of Empire: Christina Stead, Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer, Louise Yelin called the work a novel about politics, rather than a political novel per se. The Good Terrorist has also been called a satire. In her book Doris Lessing: The Poetics of Change, Gayle Greene called it a \\"satire of a group of revolutionaries\\", and Susan Watkins, writing in Doris Lessing: Border Crossings, described it as a \\"dry and satirical examination of a woman's involvement with a left-wing splinter group\\". A biography of Lessing for the Swedish Academy on the occasion of her being awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature called it \\"a satirical picture of the need of the contemporary left for total control and the female protagonist's misdirected martyrdom and subjugation\\". Yelin said the novel \\"oscillat[ed] between satire and nostalgia\\". Academic Robert E. Kuehn felt that it is not satire at all and that while the book could have been a \\"satire of the blackest and most hilarious kind\\", in his opinion Lessing \\"has no sense of humor, and instead of lashing [the characters] with the satirist's whip, she treats them with unremitting and belittling irony\\". Virginia Scott called the novel a fantasy. Drawing on Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in The International Fiction Review, she wrote that \\"[Lessing's] Alice with her group of political revolutionaries can be seen as a serious fantasy which has striking parallels to ... Carroll's Alice\\". Both Alices enter a house and are confronted by seemingly impossible challenges: Carroll's Alice has to navigate passages too small to fit through, while Lessing's Alice finds herself in a barely inhabitable house that is earmarked for demolition. Both Alices are able to change their appearances: in Wonderland, Alice adjusts her size to suit her needs; in The Good Terrorist, Alice changes her demeanour to get what she wants from others. Scott noted that at one point in The Good Terrorist, Faye refers to Alice as \\"Alice the Wonder, the wondrous Alice\\", alluding to Carroll's Alice. Themes 1983 IRA bombing of the Harrods department store (shown here in 2009) spurred Lessing to write The Good Terrorist.|alt=A photograph of a multi-storey department store The American novelist Judith Freeman wrote that one of the common themes in The Good Terrorist is that of keeping one's identity in a collective, of preserving \\"individual conscience\\". This theme suggests that problems occur when we are coerced into conforming. Freeman said that Alice is a \\"quintessential good woman ... the little Hausefrau [sic] revolutionary\\", who turns bad under peer pressure. Another theme present is the symbolic nature of the house. Margaret Scanlan stated that as in books like Mansfield Park and Jane Eyre, The Good Terrorist \\"defines a woman in terms of her house\\". Writing in the journal Studies in the Novel, Katherine Fishburn said that Lessing often uses a house to symbolise \\"psychological or ontological change\\", and that here, \\"the house ... symbolizes Alice's function in the story\\". Yelin described The Good Terrorist as \\"an urban, dystopian updating of the house-as-England genre, [where] ... England is represented by a house in London\\". Writing in \\"Politics of Feminine Abuse: Political Oppression and Masculine Obstinacy in Doris Lessing's The Good Terrorist, Lalbakhsh and Yahya suggest that the house, and the \\"oppressive relations\\" in it, reflect similar oppressive relations in society. Several critics have focused on the theme of motherhood. In \\"Mothers and Daughters/Aging and Dying\\", Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their behaviours onto their daughters, and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation. The British novelist Jane Rogers said that The Good Terrorist \\"is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left\\", and that motherhood here \\"is terrible\\": Alice's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter's demands; Alice mothers Jasper, and has a similar despairing relationship with him. Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak, despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you. Feminist themes and the subjugation of women have also been associated with The Good Terrorist. Scanlan indicated that while many of the comrades in the book are women, they find that political activity does not elevate their position, and that they are \\"trapped in the patriarchy they despise\\". Yelin suggested that although Lessing ridicules the male members of the CCU and their role playing, she is also critical of the female members \\"who collude in male-dominant political organizations and thus in their own oppression\\". But with the book's allusions to Jasper's homosexuality, Yelin added that Lessing's \\"critique of women's infatuation with patriarchal misogyny and their emotional dependence on misogynist men\\" is muted by homophobia and the \\"misogyny pervasive in patriarchal constructions of (male) heterosexuality\\". Lalbakhsh and Yahya noted that Lessing depicts Alice as a \\"typical housewife\\" who cares for her family, in this case, the squat, but is \\"ignored and neglected\\". They concluded that Alice's fate is sealed because, according to the British socialist feminist Juliet Mitchell, women are \\"fundamental to the human condition\\", yet \\"their economic, social, and political roles ... are marginal\\". Critical analysis Several critics have called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman suggested it is indicative of Alice's \\"contradictory personality\\" ‚Äì she renovates the squat's house, yet is focused on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title \\"hovers above the novel with ... irony\\". The reader assumes that Alice is the \\"good terrorist\\", but that while she may be a good person, she is \\"rotten at being a terrorist\\". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the \\"good terrorist\\", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice \\"a bad terrorist and a stunted human being\\". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the \\"good terrorist\\", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is \\"political terrorism of a literary kind\\", where she frequently disguises her ideas in \\"very domestic-looking fiction\\", and \\"direct[ly] challenge[s] ... our sense of reality\\". Kuehn described Alice as \\"well-intentioned, canny and sometimes lovable\\", but as someone who, at 36, never grew up, and is still dependent on her parents. Yelin said Alice is \\"in a state of perpetual adolescence\\", and her need to \\"mother everyone\\" is \\"an extreme case of psychological regression or failure to thrive\\". Greene wrote that Alice's \\"humanitarianism is ludicrous in her world\\", and described her as \\"so furiously at odds with herself\\" because she is too immature to comprehend what is happening and her actions vary from being helpful to dangerous. Boschman called Lessing's narrative \\"ironic\\" because it highlights the divide between who Alice is and who she thinks she is, and her efforts to pretend there is no discrepancy. Alice refuses to acknowledge that her \\"maternal activities\\" stem from her desire to win her mother's approval and, believing that her mother has \\"betrayed and abandoned\\" her, turns to Jasper as a way to \\"continue to sustain her beliefs about herself and the world\\". Even though Jasper takes advantage of her adoration of him by mistreating her, Alice still clings to him because her self-image \\"vigorously qualifies her perception of [him], and thus proliferates the denial and self-deception\\". The fact that Jasper has turned to homosexuality, which Alice dismisses as \\"his emotional life\\", \\"suits her own repressed desires\\". Kuehn called Alice's obsession with the \\"hapless\\" and \\"repellent\\" Jasper \\"just comprehensible\\", adding that she feels safe with his gayness, even though she has to endure his abuse. Knapp stated that while Lessing exposes self-styled insurrectionists as \\"spoiled and immature products of the middle class\\", she also derides their ineptness at affecting any meaningful change. Lessing is critical of the state which \\"feeds the very hand that terrorizes it\\", yet she also condemns those institutions that exploits the working class and ignores the homeless. Knapp remarks that Lessing does not resolve these ambiguities, but instead highlights the failings of the state and those seeking to overthrow it. Scanlan compared Lessing's comrades to Richard E. Rubenstein's terrorists in his book Alchemists of Revolution: Terrorism in the Modern World. Rubenstein wrote that when \\"ambitious idealists\\" have no \\"creative ruling class to follow or a rebellious lower class to lead [they] have often taken upon themselves the burden of representative action\\", which he said \\"is a formula for disaster\\". Reception Critical opinion is divided on The Good Terrorist. Elizabeth Lowry highlighted this in the London Review of Books: \\"[Lessing] has been sharply criticised for the pedestrian quality of her prose, and as vigorously defended\\". The Irish literary critic Denis Donoghue complained that the style of the novel is \\"insistently drab\\", and Kuehn referred to Lessing's text as \\"surprisingly bland\\". Lowry noted that the English academic Clare Hanson defended the book by saying that it is \\"a grey and textureless novel because it ... speaks a grey and textureless language\\". Freeman described the book a \\"graceful and accomplished story\\", and a \\"brilliant account of the types of individuals who commit terrorist acts\\". Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Freeman described Lessing as \\"one of our most valuable writers\\" who \\"has an uncanny grasp of human relationships\\". In a review in the Sun-Sentinel, Bonnie Gross wrote that it was Lessing's \\"most accessible\\" book to date, and that her \\"strong descriptive prose and her precise and realistic characterizations\\" made it \\"remarkable\\" and \\"rewarding reading\\". Gross considered the female characters, particularly Alice, much more developed than the male ones. Amanda Sebestyen wrote in The Women's Review of Books that at first glance the ideas in The Good Terrorist appear deceptively simple, and the plot predictable. But she added that Lessing's strength is her \\"stoic narrat[ion] of the daily effort of living\\", which excels in describing day-to-day life in a squat. Sebestyen also praised the book's depiction of Alice, who \\"speak[s] to me most disquietingly about myself and my generation\\". In a review in off our backs, an American feminist publication, Vickie Leonard called The Good Terrorist a \\"fascinating book\\" that is \\"extremely well written\\" with characters that are \\"exciting\\" and \\"realistic\\". Leonard added that even though Alice is not a feminist, the book illustrates the author's \\"strong admiration for women and their accomplishments\\". Writing in The Guardian, Rogers described The Good Terrorist as \\"a novel in unsparing close-up\\" that examines society through the eyes of individuals. She said it is \\"witty and ... angry at human stupidity and destructiveness\\", and within the context of recent terrorist attacks in London, it is an example of \\"fiction going where factual writing cannot\\". A critic in Kirkus Reviews wrote that Alice's story is \\"an extraordinary tour de force‚Äîa psychological portrait that's realistic with a vengeance\\". The reviewer added that although Alice is \\"self-deluding\\" and not always likeable, the novel's strength are the characters and its depiction of political motivation. Donoghue wrote in The New York Times that he did not care much about what happened to Alice and her comrades. He felt that Lessing presents Alice as \\"an unquestioned rigmarole of reactions and prejudices\\", which leaves no room for any further interest. Donoghue complained that Lessing has not made up her mind on whether her characters are \\"the salt of the earth or its scum\\". In a review in the Chicago Tribune, Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable. He said Lessing's real interest is character development, but complained that the characters are \\"trivial or two- dimensional or crippled by self-delusions\\". The Good Terrorist was shortlisted for the 1985 Booker Prize, and in 1986 won the Mondello Prize and the WH Smith Literary Award. In 2007 Lessing was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for being \\"part of both the history of literature and living literature\\". In the award ceremony speech by Swedish writer Per W√§stberg, The Good Terrorist was cited as \\"an in-depth account of the extreme leftwing squatting culture that sponges off female self-sacrifice\\". Following Lessing's death in 2013, The Guardian put The Good Terrorist in their list of the top five Lessing books. Indian writer Neel Mukherjee included the novel in his 2015 \\"top 10 books about revolutionaries\\", also published in The Guardian. Publication history The Good Terrorist was first published in September 1985 in hardcover by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom, and by Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. The first paperback edition was published in the United Kingdom in September 1986 by Grafton. An unabridged 13-hour audio cassette edition, narrated by Nadia May, was released in the United States in April 1999 by Blackstone Audio.

The location is today in Bexar County, Texas, in the United States, just west of downtown San Antonio (formerly San Antonio del Bejar). Combatants The battle was fought between the Republican (Anglo-U.S.) Army of the North, which was led by Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara and Colonel Henry A. Perry, and the Spanish Royalist force which was commanded by Colonel Ignacio Elizondo. Background In 1812, the Republican Army of the North, composed of Criollos (full-blooded Spaniards), Mestizos (mixed Spanish-indigenous), Anglo-Americans, and Indians, along with some help from the United States, crossed over from Louisiana into Spanish Texas on the filibustering Guti√©rrez‚ÄìMagee Expedition. Flying a green flag, they captured the town of Nacogdoches on August 7, 1812. The Republican Army of the North then marched to Goliad, where they captured Presidio La Bahia. From November 13, 1812, to February 19, 1813, they were besieged, when the Royalist Army gathered to confront them. Unable to defeat the Republican Army, they retreated to San Antonio. Samuel Kemper, who had also been involved in the 1804 rebellion in Spanish West Florida, and the Republican Army, now numbering about 900 men, pursued. In March 1813, the Royalist Army, numbering about 1,500 men, ambushed the Republican Army, as they searched for food along the banks of Rosillo Creek (Salado Creek), in what is today southeastern Bexar County in Texas. Although being the instigators, the Royalists were defeated in a battle that was fought within a two-hour time frame. When the Battle of Rosillo Creek was over, the Republican Army had killed between 100 and 330 men of the Royalist Army and had captured most of their arms and ammunition, losing only six of their own men in the battle. The Royalist Army retreated to San Antonio again, signed a truce with Kemper on April 1, 1813, and surrendered both Governor Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo and Nuevo Le√≥n's Governor Sim√≥n de Herrera to the Republican Army. Salcedo, Herrera, and twelve other prisoners were taken back to the battle site on Rosillo Creek, where they were executed. On April 6, 1813, the Republican Army drafted a declaration of independence, which established the first Republic of Texas. In June 1813, Colonel Elizondo advanced, with his Royalist troops, out of central Mexico and marched to San Antonio. His commanding officer, Brigadier General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Arredondo, had ordered Colonel Elizondo to advance to the Frio River, but to advance no further. Instead of obeying these orders, the colonel, who thought he would prove his loyalty to Spain by defeating the Republican Army of the North, advanced to the very outskirts of San Antonio and asked the rebels to surrender! His biggest mistake was that he underestimated his enemy's ability and pitched his camp, without seeing to all the necessary precautions. The battle On June 12, 1813, Colonel Elizondo with his army of 700 regular soldiers and over 300 volunteers camped on the outskirts of San Antonio, about 500 yards west of Alazan Creek. He underestimated the abilities of his enemy and he pitched camp without precautions, he did not post scouts for pickets, and he had only two groups of six artillery pieces to protect his camp. The Republican Army of the North under the command of Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara and Colonel Henry A. Perry surrounded the Royalist camp before sunrise. Over 800 Anglo-U.S. volunteers took their assigned positions upon the enemy's flanks while the mestizos rebels of the insurgent force prepared to charge the center. Behind the Republican Army was a large number of Indians, mostly Tonkawas, Townkans and Lipan Apaches who were anxiously waiting to chase, capture, and scalp any escaping Royalist troops. Just after dawn, while most of Elizondo's men were either awakening or preparing their meal, the Republican force began the two-hour-long battle. The Republican (Anglo-U.S.) Army's artillery was loaded with canister and scarp-iron and they aimed them at the unsuspecting soldiers as they were having their breakfast meal. The Spanish Royalist camp was a scene of confusion as soldiers fell dead or dying to the ground. Then as the Royalist troops made their way to their guns, they met with the full onslaught of the Republican Cavalry. With his solid green banner for a flag, Gutierrez de Lara led his men through the very center of the Spanish camp sparing no one in his path. The Royalists managed to rally their forces and then they recaptured most of their lost ground. The battle raged for over an hour and a half and there were constant charges and counter- charges made for the Republican and Royalist artillery emplacements. But the Royalist Army began to give way and then the bloodiest part of the entire two- hour battle took place. The pursuing insurgent cavalry was joined by their Indian allies and then the royalists were killed and scalped mercilessly. Only those Royalist soldiers who were mounted on fast horses were able to escape the slaughter. Colonel Elizondo, who had a horse shot from under him, managed to escape and then catch up with remnants of his defeated army about fifteen miles southwest of the battlefield and he ordered a hurried march back to Mexico beyond the Rio Grande. Aftermath The Republican Army of the North had defeated the Royalist force and had captured 40 mule loads of flour, 4,000 pounds of biscuits, 300 guns and muskets, 5,000 pounds of powder, $28,000 worth of goods and clothing and some $7,000 worth of miscellaneous goods including saddles, liquor, coffee, cigars and \\"other luxuries.\\" Most of the captured 2,000 horses and mules were later paid out to the Indians in exchange for their continued support. But the victory at the Alazan Creek was soon turned into a defeat for Guti√©rrez de Lara when he was replaced by U.S.-backed General Jos√© √Ålvarez de Toledo. √Ålvarez de Toledo was mistrusted by most of the native mestizos rebel (Mexican) volunteers and this destroyed the army's morale when he divided the force into groups of \\"Mexicans,\\" \\"Anglos\\" and Indians. The assimilated army which had fought victoriously at Nacogdoches, Goliad, Rosillo and the Alazan was now unprepared to meet the disciplined troops under Brigadier General Arredondo at the battle of Medina. The Republican Army of the North and the Republic which they had founded ended on August 18, 1813, when the Republican Army commanded by General Alvarez de Toledo was defeated at the Battle of Medina. Colonel Elizondo was present at that battle and a young lieutenant named Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna was also there. They both joined their commanding officer in one of the worst bloodbaths to ever take place in Texas. When the Battle of Medina was over, Elizondo had been fatally wounded by one of his own sub-alternates. Guti√©rrez de Lara went on to join two other revolutionary expeditions and later became the governor of the state of Tamaulipas after the conclusion of the War of Independence. Location The battle site is within the city limits of the modern-day city of San Antonio, Texas, slightly southwest of downtown, in Bexar County.

Flown by the air forces of 28 nations, when production of the P-40 ceased in November 1944, 13,738 had been built. Background By the fall of 1944, the United States Army Air Forces had already retired most of the early versions (P-40B/P-40L) and was in the midst of withdrawing the final variants from combat units. By VJ Day, the only remaining P-40 were in Operational Training Units (OTUs). These aircraft were struck-off charge and placed into storage. Most foreign users of the P-40 also quickly retired their P-40s as well ‚Äì the Royal New Zealand Air Force stored their last P-40s in 1947 (scrapping them by 1962) and the last military to use the P-40 operationally was the Brazilian Air Force who used them until the late 1950s. In 1947 the Royal Canadian Air Force auctioned off their surplus P-40s. Mr. Fred Dyson purchased 35 P-40Es, Ms and Ns for $50.00 each, and barged them from Vancouver to Seattle to resell. Other ex-RCAF P-40s were purchased to strip the aircraft of hardware, which was in short supply after the war. For the next 30 years the RCAF machines would make up the majority of the flying P-40s. The FAA classified P-40Es and Ms as experimental aircraft, restricting their operations. The P-40N was in the limited category typical for most warbirds, but to circumvent FAA regulations many P-40Es were licensed as P-40Ns. The Korean War in 1950 delayed USAF plans to retire the P-51 Mustang, and the Canadian P-40s were the only high performance aircraft available. It was not until the late 1950s that the P-51 became available but by this time, the Kittyhawks/Warhawks had found a popular niche for airshows. Having an aircraft which could be painted in AVG markings made them popular. From the mid 1970s to late 1980s, collectors from the United States started traveling to former South Pacific airfields and recovered a second generation of P-40 survivors. The majority of these were RNZAF and RAAF veterans. Examples are still being returned to airworthy status. The fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s made a third generation of P-40s survivors available and numerous examples were recovered from former battlefields near Murmansk. Other examples also included airframes being recovered from Alaskan wartime crashes during this same time frame. There are still numerous example of wrecked P-40s that have yet to be recovered in China, United States, Canada as well as Russia in addition to the South Pacific sites. Many governments regulate wreck site recoveries and have placed many off-limits so as to remain untouched as grave sites, somewhat limiting further recoveries.

He was known by Irish speakers at Louvain by the honorary name Aodh Mac Aingil (\\"Mac Aingil\\" is Irish for \\"Son of an Angel\\"), and it was under this title that he published the Irish work Sc√°th√°n Shacramuinte na hAthridhe. Life Mac Cathmhaoil was born at Saul, County Down, and received his earliest education in his native place, trained at one of the bardic schools still operating in Ulster.The Catholics of Ulster: A History by Marianne Elliot (pages 75-76) He next studied at a famous school in the Isle of Man. On his return to Ireland, he was hired by Hugh O'Neill, The O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, as a tutor to his sons Henry and Hugh. Mac Cathmhaoil was sent by the Earl as special messenger to the Court of Spain to solicit aid for the Ulster forces. During his stay at Salamanca, where the Court then resided, he frequented the schools of the university and took doctor's degrees in divinity. Soon afterwards he entered the Order of Friars Minor. He enjoyed a great reputation as a theologian, and his commentaries on the theologian Duns Scotus (1266‚Äì1308) were held in high repute. It was principally due to his great influence at the Spanish Court that the Irish Franciscan College of St. Anthony was founded at Leuven (Louvain). After his admission into the Order, Mac Cathmhaoil taught for some time in the University of Salamanca. He was appointed as superior and lecturer at St. Anthony's, Leuven, and moved to Belgium. Among his pupils were John Colgan, Patrick Fleming, Hugh Ward, and Antony Hickey. He was summoned to Rome to lecture in the convent of Aracoeli; but his energies were not limited to his work as professor. He was employed by the pope on several commissions. He carried out a papal mission to Ulster in 1613. Over the next three decades, Louvain produced a remarkable outpouring of Gaelic scholarship and devotional texts in Irish. In scouring the north and midlands of Ireland for all available manuscripts, to write an ecclesiastical history of Ireland, his associates (M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, a trained historian) and Aodh Mac an Bhaird (Hugh Ward) are credited with saving many of the Irish manuscripts that still survive. Mac Cathmhaoil was elected Definitor General of the Friars Minor of the Strict Observance, which gave him authority over all the friars in Europe who followed that branch of the Reform within Order. In that capacity, he gave substantial help to Friar Luke Wadding in founding and developing the College of San Isidore and Ludovisi's Pontifical Irish College in Rome, for Irish students. On 17 March 1626, Pope Urban VIII, passing over all the other candidates, nominated Mac Aingil as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. The consecration took place on 7 June, in the church of St. Isidore. Thomas Walsh, Archbishop of Cashel, was consecrated at the same time. The consecrating prelate was Cardinal Gabriel de Trejo, a great friend of the Irish. Mac Cathmhaoil's health had been much weakened by his duties and the austerities he practised. In making the visitations of the provinces of the Order, he had always travelled on foot. He also spent much time in prayer and fasting. While preparing for his departure, he caught a fever and died. Mac Cathmhaoil was buried in the Church of St. Isidore. His friend John O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, arranged for a monument to be placed on his grave. The Latin playwright, Nicolaus Vernul√¶us (1583‚Äì1649), delivered a panegyric before the university commemorating the virtues and learning of the archbishop, saying that he was conspicuous for his virtues, and that his holiness of life and profound learning made him the miracle of his time. This address was later published in Cologne in 1657. Works Mac Cathmhaoil composed four Christmas carols in Irish. His major works were in Latin about theology. In his Apologia pro Johanne Duns-Scoto, he engaged in Franciscan defence of Duns Scotus against the Dominican-inspired attacks of Bzovius and Cornelius Jansen, claiming Scotus as an Irishman. He also wrote a work in Irish, which was printed at the Irish press in the college of St. Anthony's, Leuven, in 1618, entitled Sc√°th√°n Shacramuinte na hAthridhe, or Tractatus de poenitentia et indulgentiis, that is, The Mirror of the Sacrament of Penance.

Modern helmets consist of a hard plastic, non-adjustable shell with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet to the head. Some players also attach a sun visor shielding the eyes, though these visors are not legal in most leagues (unless they are clear). Helmets are required at all levels of organized men's lacrosse,Men's Lacrosse Rules but only required for goalies in women's lacrosse.Women's Rules The main difference between helmets is weight, field of vision, and fit. It is important that the lacrosse helmet fit snug to your head to limit injury. Most helmets in the game today offer unique ways of adjusting the helmet size so you can customize it to fit your head. Lacrosse helmets are riddled with air vents to increase air flow and decrease its weight. All helmets come with an adjustable chin strap for added protection. . History Early lacrosse players did not wear helmets. When lacrosse was played at the 1908 Summer Olympics, neither of the competing teams wore helmets.1908 Summer Olympics Official Report . P 225.

The 1928 Olympics was the first documented use of lacrosse helmets. Manufacturers The most common manufacturers in men's lacrosse are Cascade, Warrior, Brine, and STX. Helmet use in women's lacrosse Following a number of head injuries to female players in the 1980s in South Australia, players and coaches moved to adopt the optional use of protective headgear in the women's game. As the movement ‚Äî led by Australian 1986 World Champions players Wendy Piltz and Jenny Williams and South Australia coach Peter Koshnitsky ‚Äî grew, players were given authorization on a trial basis to wear close-fitting, full-face helmets, first by South Australia and then by the governing body, the Australian Women's Lacrosse Council (AWLC). Further efforts were made to have the optional helmet rule adopted at the international level of play but were unsuccessful. In the United States, the governing body, US Lacrosse requires the use of protective goggles and mouth guards but has not endorsed helmet use with the exception of goal keepers (goalies). In the United States, the Florida High School Athletics Association (FHSAA), the governing body of high school athletics in the State of Florida, made helmets mandatory equipment for girls lacrosse at the Varsity and sub-Varsity levels beginning with the 2018 season. As of 2019, Florida is the only state to mandate the use of helmets in girls lacrosse.

They found that the UK had the highest rates of obesity, the highest rate of young people living with a longstanding condition, apart from Finland and Sweden, and, among 11 year olds, very low rates of exercise. The death rate from asthma and the teenage pregnancy rate were both amongst the highest. Indicators for obesity, longstanding illness, severe material deprivation and exercise levels were all deteriorating. =Life expectancy= Life expectancy at birth, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011.

Also the NHS was underresourced, doctors and groups representing older people claim not enough was done to keep older people warm and safe.Excess winter deaths in England and Wales highest since 1976 The Guardian =Infant mortality= The reduction in infant mortality between 1960 and 2008 for the United Kingdom in comparison with France, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. The overall trend has meant a large improvement in health inside the United Kingdom. Infant mortality rates have been decreasing since the early 1900s, partially due to general improvements in healthcare and more recently because of improvements in midwifery and neonatal intensive care. =Obesity= The rising rates of childhood obesity were described as a \\"national emergency\\" by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in February 2016. 28.1% of adults in the United Kingdom were recognised as clinically obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30 in 2014. = Smoking rates = In 1974, 45% of the British population smoked. The smoking rate was down to 30% by the early-1990s, 21% by 2010, and 19.3% by 2013, the lowest level for eighty years. In 2015, smoking rates in England had fallen to 16.9%. = Cancer = There were 361,216 cancer diagnoses in 2014 in the United Kingdom. Three quarters of cancers were related to smoking and drinking. = Mental health = In 2014, the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey reported that 17% of those surveyed in England met the criteria for a common mental disorder. About 37% of those were accessing mental health treatment. Those more severely affected were more likely to be accessing services. In 2017 a survey found that 65% of Britons have experienced a mental health problem, with 26% having had a panic attack and 42% said they had suffered from depression.Two thirds of adults experience mental health problems such as anxiety or depression, survey finds. The Independent. Published 8 May 2017. Retrieved 26 January 2018. Benefit cuts and sanctions \\"are having a toxic impact on mental health\\" according to the UK Council for Psychotherapy.

Of those, 69% are men and 31% were women. Just under half of those living with HIV are gay or bisexual men. 1 in 7 gay or bisexual men in London are living with HIV, compared to 1 in 25 in the rest of the UK and less than 1 in 500 for the general population. 6,095 people were newly diagnosed during 2015, a trend which has remained relatively constant since 2010. An estimated 39% of diagnoses were late (likely to have been living with the virus for over three years). = Disability = In 2014 more than 11 million British people (excluding Northern Ireland) were reported to have a long term impairment or disability. The incidence rises with age. About 6% of children, 16% of working age adults and 45% of pensioners are reported as having a disability.

Despite overall increases in life expectancy in England, the most deprived areas continue to see no change or a decrease in life expectancy. The Blair Government instituted a comprehensive programme to reduce health inequalities in England between 1997 and 2010 focused on reducing geographical inequalities in life expectancy. It was targeted at the Spearhead areas - the 20% of local authorities with the worst health and deprivation indicators. This lead to more NHS resources being directed to the most deprived areas. The strategy was associated with a decline in geographical inequalities in life expectancy, reversing a trend which had increased over a long period. However, health inequalities still remain. In 2014 to 2016, the difference in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas of England was 9.3 years for males and 7.3 years for females. Life expectancy A North-South divide in life expectancy continues to be apparent. In 2016 to 2018, this geographical divide can be seen across regions of England. The life expectancy at birth of males and females in the regions of London, the South East, South West and East of England were all significantly higher than the national average. Whereas, life expectancy was lowest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. Regions of England On average, there have been reductions in the number of years lived in poorer states of health for both men and women at age 65 in England. As of 2018, Richmond-upon-Thames had the highest male healthy life expectancy at birth in the UK of 71.9 years, 18.6 years longer than males in Blackpool where it was only 53.3 years. For females, the lowest healthy life expectancy at birth was found in Nottingham at 54.2 years, and the highest was in Wokingham at 72.2 years, a gap of 18 years. { |+ Life Expectancy in the Regions of England, 2016-2018   Male  Female |-  England 79.6 |83.2 |-  North East 77.9 |81.7 |-  North West 78.3 |81.9 |-  Yorkshire and the Humber 78.7 |82.4 |-  East Midlands 79.4 |82.9 |-  West Midlands 78.9 |82.7 |-  East 80.3 |83.7 |-  London 80.7 |84.5 |-  South East 80.7 |84.1 |-  South West 80.2 |83.8 |} The ten leading causes of death for men in England are heart disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, lung cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, influenza and pneumonia, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia and diseases of the liver, respectively. In females, the leading cause of death is dementia and Alzheimer's disease followed by heart disease, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia and kidney disease. Higher mortality rates for heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic lower respiratory diseases in the most deprived areas contribute the most to the life expectancy gap. Smoking and obesity are the main risk factors for these diseases. People in the most deprived areas are more than twice as likely to die prematurely from cancer, and there has been no significant change in this level of inequality since 2010 to 2012. Similarly, people in the most deprived areas are almost four times as likely to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease compared with those in the least deprived areas, and this inequality has also significantly widened since 2010 to 2012. Risk factors The prevalence of many risk factors, including smoking, drug use, high blood pressure and high cholesterol have declined. The prevalence of smoking has declined from 19.9% to 14.9% in the last 7 years and if this trend continues, it will reduce to between 8.5% and 11.7% by 2023. However, there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity. In England, in 2016, 26.2% of adults were obese and it is forecast that levels of obesity will increase by 2023. A study by Public Health England in 2017 found that 41% of the 15.3 million English adults aged 40 to 60 do not walk for as much as 10 minutes continuously each month at a brisk pace. A quarter of the English population was found to be ‚Äúinactive‚Äù ‚Äì doing less than 30 minutes of activity per week. The heaviest-drinking 20% of the population drink almost two thirds of all alcohol consumed.

The type species, P. graia, has seven thorax segments, and lacks the rapier-like glabellar spine, that occurs in many other raphiophorids. The Chinese species, by contrast, have only six thoracic segments. So far, only the type species, and one of the Chinese species, P. laevigata (synonym= Jiuxiella laevigata), are known from complete specimens. Species and synonymy Richard Fortey erected the genus in 1975 upon describing P. graia from Spitzbergen. In 1999, Hoel subjectively synonymized a Swedish species of Ampyx, A. brevicauda, into Pytine. The Chinese raphiophorid genera Jiuxiella and Miboshania were noted to be anatomically similar to P. graia, and were merged into Pytine, as well. In 2006, N. E. Vaccari described P. wirayasqa from several fragments from the early Arenig-aged Acoite Formation, of La Ci√©naga, Jujuy province, Argentina, together with specimens of another related raphiophorid genus, Lehnertia.  Etymology  Pytine is derived from an Ancient Greek word for a wineflask with wattles, referring to the shape and wrinkled texture of the glabellum.

CLSI promotes the development and use of voluntary laboratory consensus standards and guidelines within the health care community.  History  In 1968, 31 clinicians and laboratory scientists representing 15 organizations met to develop a formal consensus process for standardization. In 1977, CLSI was accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a voluntary consensus standards organization. At about the same time, CLSI became the home of the National Reference System for the Clinical Laboratory (NRSCL), a collection of broadly understood reference systems intended to improve the comparability of test results, consistent with the needs of medical practice. CLSI is a global association of 1,500+ member organizations and individual members, as well as more than 2,000 volunteers. Until 2005, CLSI was called the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).  Committees  CLSI documents are developed by committees composed of experts in medical testing or ancillary aspects of these activities. Development of CLSI standards is a dynamic process. Each CLSI committee produces consensus documents related to a specific discipline. The consensus process CLSI's core business is the development of globally applicable voluntary consensus standards and guidelines for the clinical laboratory. CLSI develops consensus documents through an accredited consensus process. Volunteers CLSI relies on more than 2,000 volunteers. Volunteers and mentors also work with CLSI's Global Health Partnerships to help establish laboratory quality management systems in resource-limited countries.  Global health partnerships  CLSI provides direct assistance in Sub-Saharan Africa to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. With grants from the US-based PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) program administered by a cooperative agreement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), CLSI has been directly engaged in essential laboratory services improvement. During the past several years, CLSI mentors, volunteers, and staff have provided technical assistance in C√¥te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Georgia, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Peru, Rwanda, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Ukraine, Vietnam and Zambia. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) CLSI participates in the development of international standards as the Secretariat of ISO Technical Committee (TC) 212, clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostic test systems, a responsibility that was delegated to CLSI by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), which is an ISO member body.

Lasso Logic became the third of three business divisions at SonicWALL, now called the Business Continuity Unit. Lasso CDP is now called SonicWALL CDP. Lasso Logic was the first company to provide a disk-based continuous data protection appliance, called Lasso CDP, which continually backed up servers, applications, PCs, and laptops to itself in real time. This allowed users who lost files to go back to various useful points in time. More recent backups were saved at more frequent intervals, but as backup versions receded in time, some of those versions were dropped by way of a complex algorithm which preserved theoretically more useful versions. Thus a user could always find a version to return to from the inception of backup, from minutes ago to years ago. Before Lasso Logic, the only backup options were single point in time (SPIT) snapshot software that allowed IT administrators to back up to tape or to disk, usually at a resolution of once a day. The value proposition of the company was \\"set it and forget it\\" backup, thus eliminating the labor burden of tape-based backup. The company was also the first to introduce onsite and offsite backup in a single device. Lasso CDP continuously backed up data to itself, but then replicated data to an offsite location. This allowed for instant recovery of data because the files were stored locally on the Lasso CDP appliance. However, in the event of a total loss of data locally, including the Lasso CDP appliance, the customer could pull the data back from Lasso's offsite data center.

Built in 1768, it is a remarkably sophisticated expression of fashionable Georgian architecture in a remote area, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architectural significance. It is located on the west side of the Old Georgetown Road, several miles north of South Carolina Highway 46 and McClellanville. and Description and history In 1706 the Province of Carolina formally established the Church of England, which divided what is now South Carolina into six parishes. This parish church was built in 1768. It is rectangular single-story masonry structure, built out of brick and covered by a slate hip roof. The front and rear facades both have a gabled temple-front projection, supported by four round brick columns. The rear projection has had the spaces between the columns bricked up, creating what now serves as the church vestry. The building's windows are round-arched with keystones, with a three-part Palladian window in the eastern wall. The interior retains original woodwork and hardware, including box pews, pulpit, and trim. The pulpit originally stood at the northern end of the long axis, but was apparently moved to the eastern wall sometime in the 18th century. The church is one of a handful of surviving 18th-century country churches in South Carolina. It is unusual in this group because its styling is particularly sophisticated, reflecting architectural trends in Charleston at the time of its construction. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

John Creighton Campbell, a professor at the University of Michigan and Tokyo University, told the New York Times in 2009 that Japanese people are the healthiest group on the planet. Japanese visit a doctor nearly 14 times a year, more than four times as often as Americans. Life expectancy in 2013 was 83.3 years - among the highest on the planet. A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the Lancet in September 2018. Japan had the highest level of expected human capital among the 20 largest countries: 24.1 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. Chronic illness Obesity in Japan in 2014 was about 3.3%, about 10% of that in the United States, presumably because of the Japanese diet. It has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world. Suicide problem Japan's suicide rate is high compared to the US; the Yomiuri Shimbun reported in June 2008 that more than 30,000 people had killed themselves every year for the past decade. A study published in 2006 suspects that health problems were a factor in almost 50 percent of Japan's suicides in 2006.Carl Freire, \\"Japan's suicide rate remains high\\", Associated Press, November 9, 2007. However the Yomiuris 2007 figures show 274 school children were among those who took their own lives. Bullying is often a factor in such cases. In 2011, suicide remained over 30,000 for the 14th year running. Smoking E-Goyomi (Lady Smoking) woodblock print dating between 1700 and 1800 One of the biggest public health issues is smoking in Japan, which according to Tadao Kakizoe (honorary president of the National Cancer Center) kills more than 100,000 people per year and is responsible for one in ten deaths.Yomiuri Shimbun, 8/9/2008(?). Cited in Scott, Doug. \\"Japanese Delegation Visits AAPA to Learn about PA Profession\\" . AAPA News, July 15, 2008, p. 5. Accessed 2 December 2009. Alcohol and health issues A team led by Professor Osaki of Tottori University estimated the social cost of excessive drinking in Japan to be 4.15 trillion yen a year. Access to care In Japan, services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge higher for those without a referral. However, space can be an issue in some regions. More than 14,000 emergency patients were rejected at least three times by Japanese hospitals before getting treatment in 2007, according to the latest government survey. In the worst case, a woman in her 70s with a breathing problem was rejected 49 times in Tokyo.Yamaguchi, Mari. \\"Injured Man Dies After Rejection by 14 Hospitals\\". ABC News (Associated Press), February 4, 2009. Accessed 2 December 2009. Public health insurance covers most citizens/residents and pays 70% or more cost for each care and each prescribed drug. Patients are responsible for the remainder (upper limits apply). The monthly insurance premium is 0‚Äì50,000 JPY per household (scaled to annual income). Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non- covered costs, and usually makes a fixed payment per days in a hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure. In 2005, Japan spent 8.2% of GDP on health care or US$2,908 per capita. Of that, approximately 83% was government expenditure. Cultural influences Traditional Chinese medicine was introduced to Japan with other elements of Chinese culture during the 5th to 9th century. Since around 1900, Chinese-style herbalists have been required to be licensed medical doctors. Training was professionalized and, except for East Asian healers, was based on a biomedical model of the disease. However, the practice of biomedicine was influenced as well by Japanese social organization and cultural expectations concerning education, the organization of the workplace, and social relations of status and dependency, decision- making styles, and ideas about the human body, causes of illness, gender, individualism, and privacy. Anthropologist Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney notes that \\"daily hygienic behavior and its underlying concepts, which are perceived and expressed in terms of biomedical germ theory, in fact, are directly tied to the basic Japanese symbolic structure.\\" Western medicine was introduced to Japan with the Rangaku studies during the Edo period. A number of books on pharmacology and anatomy were translated from Dutch and Latin to Japanese. During the Meiji period (late 19th century), the Japanese health care system was modeled after the model of Western biomedicine. At that time, western doctors came to Japan to create medical faculties at the newly built Japanese universities, and students also went abroad. Innovations like vaccines were introduced to Japan, improving average life expectancy. From the Meiji period through the end of World War II, German was a mandatory foreign language for Japanese students of medicine. Patient charts in Japanese teaching hospitals were even written in German. But even today, a person who becomes ill in Japan has a number of alternative options. One may visit a priest, or send a family member in his or her place. There are numerous folk remedies, including hot springs baths (onsen) and chemical and herbal over-the-counter medications. A person may seek the assistance of traditional healers, such as herbalists, masseurs, and acupuncturists. AIDS Although the number of AIDS cases remained small by international standards, public health officials were concerned in the late 1980s about the worldwide epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The first confirmed case of AIDS in Japan was reported in 1985. By 1991 there were 553 reported cases, and by April 1992 the number had risen to 2,077. While frightened by the deadliness of the disease yet sympathetic to the plight of hemophiliac AIDS patients, most Japanese are unconcerned with contracting AIDS themselves. Various levels of government responded to the introduction of AIDS awareness into the heterosexual population by establishing government committees, mandating AIDS education, and advising testing for the general public without targeting special groups. A fund, underwritten by pharmaceutical companies that distributed imported blood products, was established in 1988 to provide financial compensation for AIDS patients.

Government prioritization of preventive healthcare and environmental health began in 1925 following the establishment a public health department. The decision to create it came after a royal decree from King Abdul Aziz Al- Saud. The government announced plans to increase taxes on soft drinks and tobacco in December 2015. Obesity Across the whole population from 1995‚Äì2000, 36.9% were overweight and 35.6% were obese. Rates were high amongst children aged 5‚Äì17, as 16.7% of boys and 19.4% of girls were overweight. By 2006, 52% of men, 66% of women, 18% of teenagers, and 15% of preschoolers were overweight or obese. In 2008, 17.99% of deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease. During this year, 95% of the 424,968 total appointments to diabetics clinics were made for Saudi citizens. 55% of these diabetic citizens were women and 44% were men. The latest national prevalence for childhood obesity (ages 5 to 18) in Saudi Arabia reported: 23.1% were overweight, 9.3% were obese and 2% were severely obese (2%) (El-Mouzan et al., 2010). Part of the reason for the high rate of overweight and obesity within the population are urban residents that consume hypercaloric foods while maintaining a sedentary lifestyle. The less-than physically demanding lifestyle urban residents lead is linked to a high level of education and income. In addition, women had an increased risk of obesity because of cultural and religious beliefs that require women to stay at home as a housewife. Women are prohibited from using hotel gyms and pools and are targets of harassment when they exercise publicly. This is based on the belief that giving women the freedom to exercise would lead to the corruption and decline of the nation. In schools, physical activity for girls is avoided because some fear that changing clothes outside of the home would cause girls to lose their shyness, an admirable moral quality. As part of WHO‚Äôs goal to eradicate the use of synthetic trans fats by 2023, Saudi Arabia has taken a serious measures to reduce trans fat in food industry. In a similar context, Saudi Arabia has imposed 50% tax on soft drinks. √ÉLOKA Wellness has launched its website in 2020, to help Saudi Arabia to overcome obesity with the help of vetted practitioners in nutritionists, food addiction coaches and, health coaches. Digital opportunities are flourishing in the country, to help the citizens getting back on shape. Smoking In June 2010, the Council of Ministers urged the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) to restrict smoking at all airports and their facilities in the Kingdom, and strict rules were imposed. It also advised GACA to impose a fine of SR200 (US$53) on people who violate the new regulations. Many commercial buildings and work places banned smoking at offices in an attempt to stop smoking in public places. In addition, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran launched a program in 2010 to make their university smoke-free, and Umm al-Qura University in Mecca launched a campaign with the same title in 2011. In May 2012, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh banned people from smoking in and around its buildings, the first such move in the country. The hospital implemented fines of SR200 for violations. On 30 July 2012, Interior Minister Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz ordered the implementation of a royal ban on smoking in all government facilities (ministries, buildings, institutions, offices etc.) and most indoor public places. The ban also prohibits smoking of hookahs in public places, and prohibits selling tobacco to anyone under 18. On 1 December 2012, the Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities (SCTA) imposed a ban on smoking in all tourism facilities. In 2019, Saudi Arabia received an award for fighting and preventing smoking in the 72nd session of the World Health Assembly. Another decision was made in 2019 that charges restaurants and cafes selling tobacco products an annual amount of $26,675. It is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia imposed a 100% tax on electronic cigarettes.  Cancer Prevention  In a recent step, Saudi Arabia announced in February 2019 that it is going to take serious measures to prevent cancer. In this context, Saudi Arabia aims to be a global leader in such a field, especially that cancer has become the first killer in the Middle East. Thus, the Saudi Ministry of Health is going to make a number of initiatives that include, implementing an advanced screening program, improving palliative care and developing awareness in health care.

Unlike the previous best-of Yin and Yang (1995), this is a single disc and does not include any Marillion material. Kettle of Fish was Fish's first release under a new contract with Roadrunner Records, who signed Fish after the financially catastrophic Sunsets on Empire album and tour of 1997 had forced him to dissolve his own label Dick Brothers Record Company. (The Dick Bros. logo still appears on the back, but this appears to be strictly symbolic.) Roadrunner also re-released Fish's entire backcatalogue; Kettle of Fish was intended to draw attention to these titles, which explains the publication of another \\"best-of\\" compilation with just one studio album between this and the last one. The album was accompanied by an eponymous collection of video clips with slightly different tracks (see below). In Europe, the limited first edition of the album included a bonus CD-ROM with three videos and additional material. Tracks The album contains thirteen tracks, most of which have been singles, in non-chronological order. There are three songs each from the first two solo albums, Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors (1990) and Internal Exile (1991); \\"Just Good Friends\\" from Internal Exile appears in its 1995 re- recorded version featuring Sam Brown. The other two solo albums ‚Äì Suits (1994) and Sunsets on Empire (1997) - are represented by two songs each. The 1993 studio album with cover versions, Songs from the Mirror, is not represented. Also not included are the singles \\"The Company\\" (1990) and \\"Change of Heart\\" (1997), which had only been released in Germany and the UK, respectively. Instead, two songs that were planned as singles but never released, are included ‚Äì \\"Lucky\\" (1991) and \\"Goldfish and Clowns\\" (1997). All tracks appear in their original album versions, except for \\"Goldfish and Clowns\\" and \\"Lady Let It Lie\\", of which the single edits are used. Additionally, the album contains two new tracks. Both are products of Fish's participation in a songwriters retreat organised by Miles Copeland III at his castle Marouatte in France (incidentally the same place where Marillion had recorded Brave) in the spring of 1998. \\"Mr. Buttons\\" was co-written with Maia Sharp and Andy Gardiner; \\"Chasing Miss Pretty\\", a pure pop song, with Chris Braide and American guitarist Dave Bassett. (Another three songs from these sessions would end up on the forthcoming album Raingods with Zippos.) \\"Chasing Miss Pretty\\" was planned as a single, but never materialised. Cover art The cover is, by Fish's standards, simplistic; it shows a goldfish in an undersized, kettle-shaped aquarium on a black background.

It contains the promotional videos for ten Fish singles released to that point. Again, the singles \\"The Company\\" and \\"Change of Heart\\", for which no videos were made, are missing, as are the four new/non- single tracks found the album version. Instead, there are videos for two songs not on the album: Fish's version of the 1972 Argent hit \\"Hold Your Head Up\\", which had been the A-side of the only single from the 1993 cover album Songs from the Mirror. The second non-album video is of Tony Banks's single \\"Shortcut to Somewhere\\" (1986) from his album Soundtracks, which featured Fish on lead vocals.

The 20th is equipped with the Boeing B-52H Stratofortress. Formed in May 1917 as the 20th Aero Squadron, the squadron saw combat in France on the World War I Western Front. It took part in the St. Mihiel offensive and Meuse-Argonne offensive. After the war, it served with the Army Air Service and Army Air Corps as the 20th Bombardment Squadron During the 1920s and 1930s, the squadron was involved in field service testing of new bomber aircraft, notably the Y1B-17 Flying Fortress. During World War II the squadron fought in the North African and Italian Campaigns. It was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions during a raid on Steyr, Austria. It was a part of Strategic Air Command during the Cold War. As a medium bomber squadron it deployed to stand alert at forward bases in \\"Reflex\\" operations. After equipping with Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses stood nuclear alert, but during the Viet Nam War the squadron deployed frequently to perform Operation Arc Light bombing missions. Since 1993, the 20th Bomb Squadron has flown the B-52H Stratofortress long-range strategic bomber, which can perform a variety of missions. Today the squadron is engaged in the Global War on Terrorism. History =World War I= The squadron was first organized as the 20th Aero Squadron at Kelly Field, Texas on 17 May 1917.Barth On 29 July 1917, under command of Captain W.W. Wynne, the squadron moved to Wilbur Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, where it received its first training in the handling of Curtiss JN-4 and Standard J-1 aircraft. It deployed to France where it was assigned to the 1st Day Bombardment Group. Assigned British de Havilland DH-4 aircraft with American Liberty engines, and was engaged in combat during the St. Mihiel offensive and Meuse-Argonne offensive during 1918. After the 1918 Armistice with Germany, the squadron returned to the United States and arrived at Mitchel Field, New York on 2 May 1919. There most of the men were discharged from Army service and returned to civilian life.Battle Participation of Organizations of the American Expeditionary ForcesGorrell =Inter-War period= After the squadron returned to the United States it re- formed with new personnel at Ellington Field, Houston Texas in June 1919. The 20th equipped with some de Havilland DH-4 bombers and moved to Kelly Field. it was assigned to the new 1st Day Bombardment (later, 2d Bombardment) Group. After the establishment of the permanent United States Army Air Service in 1921, it was redesignated as the 20th Squadron (Bombardment). During this period, the unit also operated some Martin NBS-1s and British Handley Page 0/400s. A 2,000 lb. bomb \\"near-miss\\" severely damages Ostfriesland at the stern hull plates In May 1920 the squadron was temporarily assigned to Langley Field, Virginia and became part of the First Provisional Air Brigade under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. It trained with Handley Page O/400 and Martin MB-2 bombers. Its mission would be to attack captured German ships along the Atlantic coast off Virginia in a service demonstration to determine whether a battleship could be sunk by bombing. The targets were an aged and surplus US battleship and four former German Navy vessels, including the battleship , obtained in the peace settlement after World War I and scheduled for scuttling. After the completion of the demonstration, the squadron moved permanently to Langley on 30 June 1922. During the 1920s and 1930s the squadron was used for service testing of new bombardment aircraft as they were developed and improved, primarily Keystone Aircraft light biplane bombers in the 1920s. These planes became the backbone of the Army Air Corps bomber fleet in the latter part of the decade. In 1932 the squadron received and began service testing the Boeing Y1B-9, the first American all-metal monoplane bomber aircraft design. The high speed of the Y1B-9A indicated that open cockpits were now impractical, and that enclosed cockpits would be needed in the future. The Boeing B-9 made obsolete the Keystone Biplane bombers then in service. The Martin B-10 replaced the B-9 in 1936, but the squadron operated the B-10 for only a brief time. In 1937 the squadron received the new Boeing Y1B-17 four-engine heavy bomber. Twelve Y1B-17s were delivered to the 2d Bombardment Group for evaluation. At this time, the dozen Y1B-17s comprised the entire heavy bombardment strength of the United States. The 20th spent its time working out the defects in the prototype aircraft, working with Boeing engineers to make corrections for the final production model B-17B. One recommendation was the use of a checklist that the pilot and copilot would use together before takeoff, hopefully preventing accidents such as the one which resulted in the loss of the original Boeing Model 299. 20th BS Boeing Y1B-17s fly-by near the Italian liner \\"Rex,\\" about 800 miles east of New York City, 12 May 1938. Six planes of the squadron took part in a good will flight from Langley to Buenos Aires, Argentina, taking off from Langley on 15 February 1938 and returning on 27 February. They covered a total of 12,000 miles without serious incident. In May 1938, planes of the squadron took part in a demonstration in which they \\"intercepted\\" the Italian ocean liner while it was still 700 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean. This demonstration of the Y1B-17's range and navigational capabilities, but also showed how useful the plane could be in attacking an enemy invasion force before it came close enough to American shores to do any damage. The Navy was not amused by this particular demonstration, and was furious about what it perceived to be Army intrusion into the Navy's mission. Shortly thereafter, the War Department restricted the activities of the Army Air Corps to a 100-mile range of the US shoreline. The Y1B-17s flew for three years without a serious accident, and were transferred to the 19th Bombardment Group at March Field in October 1940. The squadron received new production Boeing B-17D Fortresses to replace them. =World War II= Boeing B-17F-85-BO Fortress 42-30082 from the 20th Bomb Squadron undergoes maintenance in the open at Ain M'lila Airfield, Algeria in the late summer of 1943. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the squadron served on antisubmarine duty along the mid-Atlantic coastline as part of I Bomber Command for several months until it was reorganized as AAF Antisubmarine Command. The squadron re-equipped with more modern B-17F Flying Fortresses and moved to Ephrata Army Air Field, Washington for transition and combat training in late 1942 and early 1943. It moved to North Africa in April 1943, carrying out bombing missions in Algeria and Tunisia as part of Twelfth Air Force during the North African Campaign. The unit flew many support and air interdiction missions, bombing such targets as marshalling yards, airfields, troop concentrations, bridges, docks, and shipping. The 20th participated in the defeat of Axis forces in Tunisia during April and May 1943; the reduction of Pantelleria and the preparations for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, in May through July 1943; and Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy in September. The squadron was transferred to Fifteenth Air Force control in December 1943 and engaged in bombing operations primarily in Italy in support of the Allied drive north toward Rome from January to June 1944. It also supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France in August 1944 and the campaigns against German forces in northern Italy from June 1944 until the end of the war. The unit engaged primarily in long-range bombardment of strategic targets after October 1943, attacking oil refineries, aircraft factories, steel plants, and other objectives in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Greece. En route to bomb a vital aircraft factory at Steyr, Austria during Big Week on 24 February 1944, the group was greatly outnumbered by enemy interceptors, but it maintained its formation and bombed the target, receiving a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for the performance. On the following day, while on a mission to attack aircraft factories at Regensburg, it met similar opposition equally well and was awarded a second DUC. The 20th served as part of the occupation force in Italy after V-E Day and was inactivated in Italy on 28 February 1946. =Strategic Air Command= A U.S. Air Force Boeing B-52D-60-BO Stratofortress (s/n 55-0100) dropping bombs over Vietnam. The squadron was reactivated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bomber squadron under Strategic Air Command in 1947 and assigned to Chatham Air Force Base near Savannah, Georgia, until Hunter Air Force Base was ready to accept the 2d Bombardment Wing. it flew B-29 and later Boeing B-50 Superfortresses during the early postwar era. The 20th participated in electronic countermeasures testing and evaluation from May 1950 until May 1952. Equipped with B-47 Stratojet medium bombers in 1954, flying training missions and standing nuclear alert until the phaseout of the B-47 in 1963. The squadron moved to Barksdale Air Force Base, where it began to re-equip with the Boeing B-52F Stratofortress in 1963. The squadron was moved to Carswell Air Force Base on 25 June 1965, joining the 9th Bombardment Squadron as the second B-52F squadron at Carswell. During the Vietnam War, the squadron would switch rotations to Andersen AFB, Guam for Operation Arc Light missions over Southeast Asia with the 9th, while the other squadron remained on nuclear alert at Carswell. The unit continued Arc Light deployments, switching to the B-52D in 1969 until March 1970 when the draw down of the Vietnam War ended forward deployments to Andersen. The squadron continued nuclear alert with the B-52D until 1983, when it re-equipped with B-52Hs, acquiring the aircraft of the 46th Bombardment Squadron at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota. During the 1980s it conducted B-52 training missions over bombing range sites and supported the wing mission of aerial bombardment. =Current era= B-52H over Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom The squadron returned to Barksdale in 1992 with the closure of Carswell and became part of the new Air Combat Command. It continued training for global conventional bombardment missions and maintained nuclear operational readiness. After the September 11 attacks the 20th deployed to the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and on 7 October 2001 flew attacks on targets in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. In February 2003 it deployed to Guam to deter North Korean aggression. On 21 July 2008, a squadron B-52 aircraft crashed near Guam during a training mission in support of Guam's Liberation Day festivities. All six crewmembers, three of whom were from the 20th, perished.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and Description and history St. James Church is located on a wooded lot on the west side of Snake Road, between the Goose Creek Primary School and Goose Creek Road. It is a single story masonry structure, built out of stuccoed brick and covered with a clipped-gable slate roof. The building corners are quoined, and there is a line of simple brickwork at the eave. There are entrances at the centers of three sides, with flanking round-arch windows. The main entrance is on the west side, with flanking pilasters rising to a decorative frieze and gabled pediment. The interior has three aisles separating rows of 18th-century box pews. The east end of the building has the pulpit, with an original reading stand and sounding board. The wall behind the pulpit carries rich baroque decoration, whose central feature is the seal of George I of Great Britain. Its decorations include cherubs in stucco and a pelican feeding her young.HABS Report SC-99, HABS data pages The Province of Carolina formally established the Church of England in 1706, dividing South Carolina into six parishes. The Saint James parish church was built 1713-19 by English settlers from Barbados, and is one of the oldest Episcopal churches in the United States. The building has seen some modest alterations, and its walls were strengthened with iron tie rods in 1844. The church was damaged by an earthquake in 1886, which collapsed the west gable end. The original churchyard is now surrounded by a brick wall. Buried in the churchyard is Ralph Izard, a former U.S. senator from South Carolina who served as president pro tempore of the Senate in 1794.

In addition to interdisciplinary research projects and its postgraduate \\"M.A. British Studies\\" course, the Centre offers a broad range of events for the public. The GBZ is the only of its kind in the German-speaking world.  History  The Centre for British Studies is an interdisciplinary research and teaching institute at Humboldt University. Inaugurated on 15 July 1995 by the governing mayor of Berlin and the British ambassador, the Centre celebrated its twentieth anniversary in the summer of 2015. The Centre was established in recognition of the UK‚Äôs role as one of the Western powers which protected West-Berlin during the Cold War. Queen Elizabeth II had already taken an interest in the plan to establish such a centre on her state visit to Berlin in 1992. Subsequently, the Prince of Wales paid his respect to the GBZ on the occasion of his visit at the end of 1995. The purpose of the Centre is to offer an institutional framework for interdisciplinary research, for teaching British Studies, and for furthering public relations between Britain and Germany. As an area studies institute the Centre is part of a larger network of area studies departments of the Berlin universities: The Centre for French StudiesFrankreichzentrum: http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu- berlin.de/frankreichzentrum/index.html (now at Free University), the John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies: http://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html(Free University), the Department for Northern European Studies Department for Northern European Studies: at the (Humboldt University) and the Centre for Modern Oriental Studies Centre for Modern Oriental Studies: http://www.zmo.de/index_e.html Due to its interdisciplinary nature the GBZ is not part of one of the faculties of the Humboldt University, but enjoys the status of an independent institute with three chairs: for British Literature and Culture, for legal, economic and social structures of the UK, and for British History.  The study programme  The Centre for British Studies launched the postgraduate study programme ‚ÄúMaster in British Studies‚Äù (today \\"M.A. British Studies) in 1999. It is designed for German and international graduate students from all academic disciplines. The programme lasts a total of four semesters, the first two of which constitute the taught element of the course (Certificate Phase) and take place at the Centre in Berlin. Teaching is offered not only by full-time staff working at the Centre, but also by guest lecturers from the UK and representatives of British companies and institutions. In the ‚Äúcore programme‚Äù, which takes place during the first semester, the students are familiarised with the history, legal structures, literature, art, economic- and social history, the political system as well as the social structures of the UK. In the second semester the students can choose between six options that are to prepare them for the labour market. Following the certificate phase, the students are required to undertake a three-month work placement in the UK in order to acquire direct experience of working and living cultures in the UK. Subsequently, the students complete the course programme by writing and submitting a Master Thesis, whose theme may be selected by the student, and which should be related to one of the wide range of topics that were addressed in the programme. The successful graduates are awarded the degree ‚ÄúM.A. British Studies‚Äù.  Other institutions  Following the foundation of the Centre for British Studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin, other Centres for British Studies have also been founded at the University of Applied Sciences Zittau/ G√∂rlitz in 1999 and at the University of Bamberg in 2000.

Personal life Needles was born in Mount Vernon, Iowa, in 1893. He received his undergraduate degree at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and his graduate degree in business administration at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He had a daughter and two sons, Lauranna Jones, William and Myron (Bud), with his wife Marian. Needles died on January 6, 1986. B. F. Goodrich After school, Needles began working at B. F. Goodrich (now known as Goodrich Corporation) in 1916 in Akron, Ohio. He moved to Waterloo, Ontario, Canada in 1925 after Goodrich purchased the Ames-Holden Rubber Company, and worked at its office as an assistant sales manager, and was eventually promoted to several positions including general manager of the tire division (1930), vice-president of sales, and chairman of the board (1958). After 26 years, he eventually rose to the position of president of B.F. Goodrich Canada, in 1951. He resigned from B.F. Goodrich in 1960. During World War II, Needles served as a technical advisor for the Government of Canada to help ration rubber, which was a strategic material during the war. After the war, he founded the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, where his son, William, became an actor. University of Waterloo In the summer of 1956, Needles gave a speech at the Rotary Club of Kitchener-Waterloo entitled WANTED: 150,000 Engineers ‚Äì The Waterloo Plan. In this presentation, Needles offered a different approach to education that would include both studies in the classroom and training in industry that would eventually become the basis of the cooperative education program at the University of Waterloo. Needles suggested that universities and industry should work together to fill the growing need for skilled graduates. In 1958, he was named the first Kitchener- Waterloo Citizen of the Year by the K-W Jaycees and was a member of the Kitchener Chamber of Commerce. Waterloo College (now Wilfrid Laurier University) planned to open a science faculty that would become known as the Waterloo College Associate Faculties in 1957. Needles‚Äîalong with his B.F. Goodrich colleague, then-president of Waterloo College, and first president of the University of Waterloo, Gerald Hagey‚Äîfounded the Waterloo College Associate Faculties, which later became the University of Waterloo, with Needles' vision of a cooperative education program that involved industry.

It lived during the late Atdabanian stage, which lasted from 521 to 515 million years ago during the early part of the Cambrian Period. The first specimens were first found in Siberia, where they were originally thought to have been endemic. Later, though, more specimen were found in the Inyo Mountains in Southern California. An Ediacarian proarticulatan was given the same name, Archaeaspis Ivantsov, 2001. This is however a junior homonym. The name Archaeaspis Repina in Khomentovskii and Repina, 1965, for the trilobite has priority. The new valid name for the proarticulate is Archaeaspinus Ivantsov, 2007.  Etymology  The genus name is the combination of the Ancient Greek ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±·øñŒøœÇ (archaƒ´os) meaning \\"ancient\\" and ·ºÄœÉœÄŒØœÇ (aspis) meaning \\"shield\\". The names of the species have the following derivations. * A. hupei is named in honor of Pierre Hup√©, a distinguished French paleontologist. * A. nelsoni in named in honor of Clem Nelson, emeritus professor, who worked at the University of California at Los Angeles, and at the White Mountain Research Station. He collected the material the specimens the description of this species is based upon. * A. macropleuron is the combination of the Greek words ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøœÇ (makros) meaning \\"large\\" and œÄŒªŒµœÖœÅœéŒΩ (pleuron) meaning \\"rib\\", named for the macropleural spine of the 3rd thorax segment in this species.  Distribution  * A. hupei is found on the Siberian platform. * A. nelsoni was collected in the Lower Cambrian of California, USA (probably Nevadella-zone), Inyo County; on a small hill just south of the east-west road leading to Silver Canyon, Montenegro Member of the Campito Formation, Blanco Mountains; and on a south facing dip slope on the North side of a small east-west canyon on the east side of the road, Campito Formation, near Bishop. * A. macropleuron occurs in the Lower Cambrian of California, USA (probably Nevadella-zone), Inyo County; on a small hill just south of the east-west road leading to Silver Canyon, Montenegro Member of the Campito Formation, Blanco Mountains; Campito Formation near Waucoba Springs.  Description  As with most early trilobites, Archaeaspis has an almost flat exoskeleton that is only thinly calcified, and has crescent-shaped eye ridges. As part of the Olenellina suborder, Archaeaspis lack dorsal sutures. The superfamily Fallotaspidoidea, to which Archaeaspis belongs can be distinguished from all other Olenellina by features of the cephalon and in particular the glabella. The glabella tapers forward. The frontal lobe of the glabella (because it is counted from the back, it is numbered L4) is as long as the most backward lobe (L0), less than in the other Olenellina. The eye ridges (or ocular lobes) contact, but do not merge with, the entire frontal margin of the glabella. In Archaeaspis the frontal lobe of the glabella (L4) does not contact the anterior border furrow, but is connected with it by a ridge at midline (called plectrum). There is an obvious ridge that crosses the area between the ocular lobe and the glabella backward and slightly outward at approximately 10¬∞ (called interocular ridge).

It is a prominent member of the Sirius Passet fauna. Buenellus higginsi is the only known species in the genus Buenellus (i.e., the genus is monotypic).  Etymology  The genus name is a contraction of Buen, from the formation in which it was first collected, and Olenellus, a somewhat related trilobite genus. The species specific epithet honors A. Higgins, who discovered the Sirius Passet ' in 1984 during the Geological Survey of Greenland.  Description  General outline of the body is rounded the front third, parallel sided the middle third, and progressively tapering backwards in the back third, ending at an angle of approximately 45¬∞ with the midline. Headshield (or cephalon is approximately ‚Öù√ó as long as wide. The (in this case only slightly) vaulted central axis in the head or glabella tapers gently forward and does not reach the anterior margin. The outer backside of the cephalon (or genal angle) has short genal spines. The thorax has 17 or 18 articulating segments, maintaining width or widening slightly backward to 8th segment, then tapering posteriorly. The posterior segment may be fused with anterior part of a simple and small pygidium. Pleural spines are short, and the pleural regions only slightly wider than the axis. = Differences with other Nevadiidae = The general shape of the body of other species in the Nevadid family (like Nevadia and Nevadella) is shorter, with the greatest width across the back of the cephalon, and the entire thorax tapering backwards.  Distribution  Buenellus higginsi has been collected from (early to middle Atdabanian) at the lower Buen Formation (‚ÄúNevadella‚Äù Zone), Sirius Passet at its junction with the J. P. Koch Fjord, Peary Land, Greenland . It has also been reported from Novaya Zemlya, Russian Republic.  Ecology  Mineral-filled gut tracts in B. higginsi suggest they were not filled with sediment at the time of burial, and that the species was a predator of soft prey. Healed injuries, some of which are the result of unsuccessful predaceous attacks, are uncommon in B. higginsi. Carnivory on B. higginsi is also implied by the remains of anomalocaridids and other potential predators. Other exoskeletons show evidence of post-mortem disruption, perhaps because of scavenging. Buenellus higginsi, one of the earliest known trilobites from Laurentia, seems to have played an important role in the Sirius Passet ecosystem, serving both as predator on, and prey for, contemporary animals.  Habitat  Buenellus higginsi was probably a marine bottom dweller, that lived in deeper water. This may be deduced from the dominance of eyeless forms and the absence of seaweeds at the collection site.  Soft tissue preservation  Many specimens of B. higginsi show some form of exceptionally preserved, non- biomineralised tissue. Structures interpreted as alimentary tracts and probable digestive glands are commonly preserved. The slender antennas are rarely preserved.

It lived during the late Atdabanian and Botomian stages, in what are currently Antarctica, Australia and China. It was a \\"moderately common\\" member of the Chengjiang Fauna. Yunnanocephalus is the only genus currently assigned to the Yunnanocephalidae family.  Description  Yunnanocephalus is a small (about ) trilobite with an inverted elongated egg-shaped outline. Its headshield (or cephalon) is ovate and twice as wide as long, slightly wider than and not confluent with the articulate middle part of the exoskeleton (or thorax). The raised central section (or glabella) is weakly defined, without clear furrows except for one defining the occipital ring, tapering forward, with the front straight and confluent with the eye ridges. The occipital ring is about as wide as the border and the axial rings of the thorax. The distance between the glabella and the frontal border is slightly wider that the border. The visual surface of the eye is rather small (about 20% of the length of the cephalon), with the front about halflength of the cephalon. The natural rupture line (or suture) anterior of the visual surface is parallel to the midline or converges slightly forward and from the back of the eye diverges to the middle of the widely rounded back edges of the cephalon. The thorax has 14 segments, with short triangular spines, the 3rd and 4th slightly wider than the frontal segments, and a small tailshield (or pygidium) consisting almost fully of the axis and post axial boss, with two vaguely defined axial rings.  Ontogeny  During the ontogenetic development of Y. yunnanensis between a late larval phase (meraspis degree 9, 2¬Ωmm) and the adult (or holaspis) the facial suture changes from proparian to gonatoparian. Although this development has also been observed in Duyunaspis duyunensis, it is really uncommon. Usually, proparian holaspid trilobites developed from opisthoparian meraspids due to a mechanism called heterochrony.

Tsunyidiscus appeared near the end of the Lower Cambrian, during the late Atdabanian stage of geologic time and some collections suggest it may have survived into the Botomian. The genus is very small (up to 7mm), occulatre and isopypous with a narrow dome-shaped glabella and a narrow bullet-shaped pygidial axis. Thorax consists of three segments. Tsunyidiscus is the only genus currently attributed to the family Tsunyidiscidae.  Description  Like other Agnostida the exoskeleton of Tsunyidiscus is diminutive and isopygous with 3 fulcrate thoracic segments. The cephalon has a strongly parabolic outline and maximum width (tr.) usually anterior the to genal angles. Glabella extremely narrow, lateral glabellar furrows usually obscure, with a rounded and expanded frontal glabellar lobe. The occipital ring (LO) is at least as long as L1, usually expanded laterally, and may bear a sharp posteriorly directed spine. Long, curved posterior fixigenal spines may be present. The occipital furrow is transverse and uninterrupted. Facial sutures proparian. Librigenae are 0.5% as long as the cephalon. The pygidium has a narrow multi=segmented axis (with five, six or more segments). The thoracic and pygidial axial segments may carry nodes.Whittington, H. B. et al.

The glabella of Tsunyidiscus is extremely similar to that of Dipharus clarki, and distinct from all other eodiscoids. D. clarki is thought to represent an immature stage of the redlichioid Bulaiaspis rather than an eodiscoid. This is because of the dominant palpebroocular ridges, extremely long librigenae, and free pleural tips on the pygidium of variable numbers of segments. In short: Tsunyidiscus is thought to have developed through paedomorphosis from Bulaiaspis. = Descendants = Three lineages are thought to have evolved from Tsunyidiscus. First the Hebediscidae, that themselves gave rise to the Weymouthiidae, which contain Tannudiscus, the probable ancestor of the Agnostina. Second the Yukoniidae, who sprouted the Eodiscidae. And finally the Calodiscidae.
