History The building of the Faculty of Law of the Federal University of Pernambuco. It is one of the first superior education centres created in Brazil; it was created (together with the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S√£o Paulo) on August 11, 1827 by an imperial law of Dom Pedro I, of Brazil. It was first located in the city of Olinda but since 1854 it moved to Recife. Since 1912 it is located in its own palace at the praca Dr. Adolfo Cirne downtown in Recife. Since its beginning the Faculdade de Direito do Recife was important not only for graduating bachelors in law but also for being a centre of excellence in philosophy and humans sciences. It is one of the most important superior education centres in Brazil. Between 1860 and 1960 a social, philosophic, intellectual movement known as \\"Escola do Recife\\" (The Recife's school) influenced the positivist philosophy and it understanding.

Its seat is the town of Jesen√≠k. With approximately 38,000 inhabitants it is the least populated district of the Czech Republic. The area called Jesen√≠ky region is in the most northern bulge of Silesia and Moravia. It is closed by frontier with Poland that passes westward through Rychleby Hills and crosses the Nysa Lowlands to Zlat√© Hory. The massif of Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k in the south represents both the geomorphologic and climatic contrast to the lowlands of Javorn√≠k and Vidnava opened to Poland. The town of Jesen√≠k, an important crossing connection, connecting Silesia, separated by the mountain ridge from Moravia is the cultural and economic centre of the region. This town is situated at rivers Bƒõl√° and Sta≈ô√≠ƒç confluence forming a wide and branching valley where the diversity in the composition of nationalities is very diversified. Nature Mountains The landscape relief of the Jesen√≠k region is characteristic with the impressive mountain ridges of Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k, towering as high as above the line of forests, with that flat ridges of Zlatohorsk√° vrchovina (Highland) in the southeast, with the border range of Golden Mountains and its foothills ≈Ωulovsk√° pahorkatina (Hilly Country) protruding from the lowlands at the Czech-Poland frontier in the northeast. All these mountain ridges are considered a part of the extensive unit of the Eastern Sudeten, now commonly called Jesen√≠ky Mountains. The uncovered top of Keprn√≠k (Mt., 1426 m) with its top rocks upon the Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k, reaches the highest point in the region and on the contrary, the river Vidnavka leaves the country in the lowest point (230 m) at Vidnava. Most of the area is covered by forest. In higher locations there are mountain green-fields and varied flora. Originally broadleaved and fir forests have been recently substituted by the spruce monoculture. Bare spots above the line of forests (about 1330 m) are overgrown with grass and locally with man-planted dwarf pines. There are only few places where remnants of the original growth have been conserved. The deep forests of Golden Mountains and ≈Ωulovsk√° pahorkatina passes into green-fields, pastures with scattered villages and lonely houses. Rivers Most of the rivers and streams belong to the area which feeds the Baltic sea with water: the biggest Bƒõl√° river with its tributary Sta≈ô√≠ƒç, the gold-bearing ƒåern√° Opava fed by Rejv√≠z highmoor bog water and river Vidn√°vka and its tributaries flowing down Golden Mountains. Mountain torrents from many waterfalls and cascades, in shallow depressions with impermeable underlying bed highmoor bogs originated. The springs on the hill-sides around the town of Jesen√≠k, with favourable climate, are the critical agents for the rise of the spa resort. The educational path Rejv√≠z with the Great Moss Pond and the N√Ωznerov Waterfalls at the St≈ô√≠brn√Ω Creek, Vidnavka grass-fields, Ztracen√© √ödol√≠ (Lost Valley) at V√°penn√° and many other places of interest are worth seeing. There are karst formations in the limestone areas. The caves \\"Na Pomez√≠\\", rich in dropstone decoration and historically valuable caves \\"Na ≈†piƒç√°ku\\" are also opened for tourists. Fauna Many kinds of wild animals live in the forests here: deer, roebuck, wild boar, hare; in the ≈†er√°k and Keprn√≠k area chamois, imported here from Austria Alpen in the beginning of the century. In the Jesen√≠ky the grouse, hazel hen, black grouse, from birds of prey hawk, buzzard and rare falcon still nest in the region. Nature protection In 1969 the Protected Landscape Area (CHKO) Jesen√≠k was founded, comprising the mountain ridge of Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k and a part of the Zlatohorsk√° vrchovina (Highlands). Specifically valuable areas are protected in national reserves: ≈†er√°k-Keprn√≠k with conserved virgin forest and distinguished flora and Rejv√≠z with the highmoor bog and rich fauna and flora. Similar importance has the National Reserve Ra≈°elini≈°tƒõ Sk≈ôitek (\\"the peat bog\\") and the largest and most valuable nature reservation Pradƒõd with famous Velk√Ω and Mal√Ω Kotel (Big and Little Kettle) called the \\"Botanic Garden of the Middle Europe\\". The National Nature Monument ≈†piƒç√°k is known with its karst formation and ingenuous growths of yew. Climate Geomorphological diversity is incidental to climatic diversity as well. The rough climate of Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k penetrates the moderate climate of Silesian Lowlands and causes frequent turns at weather. This specifically moderate climate with low precipitations is in Vidnavka area situated in the precipitation shadow of the Jesen√≠k (Mts.).Ko≈°ack√Ω, Petr, The Jesen√≠k Region, Association of towns and communities of Jesen√≠k region (1997), CZ. History This mountain region has been already settled in the 12th century by Slavonic populations, which is documented by preserved place-names and fieldnames. The process of colonization was accomplished in the next century by the arrival of the German population. The Jesen√≠k region was a part of the Nysa-Otmuchow principality and by Church in hands of the Wroc≈Çaw bishops. German colonization was the work of Wroc≈Çaw bishops Thomas I. and above all Thomas II. Since the 13th century the Czech, German and Polish influences have been mixed here, in addition to other nationalities such as Slovaks, Greeks, Romanians and Ukrainians. Prospectors of noble metals and miners formed the important part of new settlers. The gold mining in the eras of the top and late Middle Ages was connected with personalities as were for example German businessmen kin of Fuggers from Augsburg. In the next centuries periods of economic prosperity and stability alternated with periods of the spirit and material breakdown. Especially the years of religious wars belonged to the darkest periods of the history. They brought the population much suffering and affliction. An economic decline arrived with The Hussite Wars, when troops of warriors of God passed the country in their crusade against Wroc≈Çaw. In 1424 the castles and bishop's towns of the region were captured. Much more disasters were brought by passes of armies during the Thirty Years Wars, which involved especially to country population the period of horrific, slaughter, and firing of farm-houses. Certainly it is not a hazard that just in that time of deep economic and moral declination the Jesen√≠k region was affected by the wave of spiritual cancer in inquisition trials with alleged wise women. The trials framed in Jesen√≠k and Nysa regions in the years 1622‚Äì1684, cost hundreds of human victims. Wars of Austria Heritage also unfavourably affected the region in the fortieth years of the 18th century. The Wroc≈Çaw Piece in 1742 split Silesia into two parts: Prussian and Austrian shares. The Jesen√≠k region has devoted to Austrian Silesia since that year. After the separation of original economic centre in Nysa, it created a new administrative area called the Czech part of the Nysa principality. This status existed to the year 1848, when it died out with the feudal system. Among glorious periods of the country below the Pradƒõd there are for example beginnings of industrial enterprising in the last centuries (ferrous metallurgy, textile industry, stone industry). Origin and development of a spa resort forms the particularly important chapter in the regional history. Economy The nature conditions, mineral resources and separation from centres inside the country determine the way of life of its inhabitants. The whole region is of agricultural and industrial character. Beside the quarrying and treatment of granite, limestone and marble, also the woodwork, textile and other branches of industries have arisen here. The mining of base metals and gold, having been kept at Zlat√© Hory is declining now. Agriculture is prosperous particularly in undulated and fertile plain between Vidnava, Bernartice and Javorn√≠k called \\"Silesian Hanakia\\" due to its fairly sunny climate.

It literally means \\"the highest\\" and has originally been a rank for regiment commanders. In Finland, brigades are also commanded by holders of this rank. It is the highest rank below general officers. Finnish Defense Forces rank of Eversti is comparable to Ranks of NATO armies officers as OF-5  History and related ranks   1600 - 1700  Commander of a regiment that consisted of 1200 troops split into eight companies held this rank. One of the companies was called lifeguard company and was commanded by the √∂verste himself with a kaptenl√∂jtnant as his deputy. However, the command of the lifeguard company was mostly delegated to the kaptenl√∂jtnant during battle. The regiment was split into two battalions during battle where the √∂verste was in command of the first battalion. The holder was not paid by his rank but by his line of command. Thus, he received three salaries: salary for being the head of the regiment, the head of a battalion as well as being the head of a company.  Sweden: Before 1983  The holder of the rank who served as a commander of a regiment was also assigned a wartime position as commander of the corresponding brigade. A regiment is a pure training institution and produced about one battalion a year to populate the brigade.  Sweden: Currently  The war organization has drastically been reduced from about 30 brigades to a few battalions (Military units of the Army). As a result, there is a major surplus of officers with 330 officers in this rank. Almost all do not command any military battle units; but take up senior tasks related to administration, staff, education, training, planning.Personnel department of the National Defense at Liding√∂v√§gen Stockholm ‚ÄúBastionen‚Äù Some holders of the rank are also seen as heads or deputy heads of training centers (called regiment) that employ about 600 military and civilian staff and train about 1200 conscripts.  Finland  Colonels (eversti) have usually fulfilled roles similar to Brigadier General in other armies. Indeed, the rank of Brigadier General (prikaatikenraali) has been introduced relatively recently, enabling better compatibility of ranks in peacekeeping operations. In most large military installations such as training brigades, the commander is a Colonel, and several officers of the General Staff, such as inspectors of services, are also Colonels.

Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the √ñrebro-based regional newspaper Nerikes Allehanda published one of the drawings on 18 August as part of an editorial on self-censorship and freedom of religion. English translation: While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from Muslims in Sweden as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Jordan, as well as by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). The controversy occurred about a year and a half after the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark in early 2006.  Background  Lars Vilks On 11 June 2007, Vilks was invited to participate in an art exhibition on the theme \\"The Dog in Art\\" () that was to be held in the small town of T√§llerud in V√§rmland. Vilks submitted three pen and ink drawings on A4 paper depicting Muhammad as a roundabout dog. At this time, Vilks was already participating with drawings of Muhammad in another exhibition in Vestfossen, Norway, on the theme \\"Oh, My God\\". Vilks, who is a known proponent of institutional art, has stated that his original intention with the drawings was to \\"examine the political correctness within the boundaries of the art community\\". According to Vilks, the art and culture communities in Sweden repeatedly criticize the United States and Israel, whereas Muslim values are rarely even questioned. On 20 July, the day before the opening of the exhibition in T√§llerud, the organizers decided to withdraw Vilks's drawings from the exhibition due to security concerns and fear of violence from Islamic extremists (see Islam and blasphemy and Islam and animals). M√§rta Wennerstr√∂m, the exhibition's organizer, said that at first she \\"didn't realize the gravity of the situation\\" and that she made the decision to remove the drawings after consulting Swedish government agencies and private persons. Following the first refusal to publish the drawings, Vilks submitted his drawings to the Gerlesborg School of Fine Art in Bohusl√§n (where he is a frequent lecturer) for a special teachers' exhibition that was going to be opened on 18 August. On 13 August, however, the school announced that they also had decided to reject the drawings due to security concerns. This second rejection started an intense debate in the Swedish media about self-censorship and freedom of expression. On 18 August, the √ñrebro-based regional newspaper Nerikes Allehanda published one of Vilks's drawings in an editorial on freedom of expression. The editorial defended \\"Muslims' right to freedom of religion\\" but also said it must be permitted to \\"ridicule Islam's most foremost symbols ‚Äî just like all other religions' symbols.\\" On the same day, the drawings were also published in several other Swedish newspapers including Aftonbladet, Dagens Nyheter, Expressen and Upsala Nya Tidning.  Reactions   International reactions  On 27 August, the Swedish charg√©e d'affaires in Tehran, Gunilla von Bahr, was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry where she received a protest from the Iranian government against the publication in Nerikes Allehanda. On 28 August the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, commented on the drawings during a press conference. He was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying: \\"Religions call for friendship, equality, justice, peace and respect for divine prophets. The Zionists only pretend to believe in religion. They are telling lies. They are perpetrating oppression against the Europeans and putting at risk the prestige of Europe.\\" On 30 August, the Swedish charg√© d'affaires in Islamabad, Lennart Holst, was summoned to the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive a similar protest from the Pakistani government. The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs later issued a statement where it condemned the publication \\"in the strongest terms\\". On the same day the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), an inter-governmental organization which represents 57 Muslim countries, issued a statement where it strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Muhammad by Swedish artist Lars Vilks in the Nerikes Allehanda newspaper. The secretary-general of OIC, Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu, further called on the Swedish government to take \\"immediate punitive actions against the artist and the publishers of the cartoon and asked for their unqualified apology\\". On 31 August, supporters from Islamic parties in Pakistan burned the Swedish flag in the city of Lahore. In Karachi, others torched an effigy of the Swedish Prime Minister to protest the cartoon. On 1 September, the Afghan newspaper Kabul Times published a statement by religious scholars, imams and the Afghan Ministry of Islamic Guidance. The statement said that \\"The sold-out enemies of Islam draw the cartoon of the respected Prophet of Islam once more. This has disturbed the Islamic world and aroused the indignation of all Muslims\\". The statement demanded those responsible be handed over to a court for prosecution and punishment. On 3 September, the Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments condemned the publication, saying that \\"such an irresponsible act is not conducive to friendly ties between the Islamic world and the west\\". On the same day, also the Jordanian government condemned the publication. A spokesperson for the government said that \\"The publication of this cartoon, which seeks to attack the character of the Prophet Mohammed, is unacceptable, rejected and condemned\\".  Domestic reactions  On 25 August, a group of about 60 Muslims held a demonstration outside Nerikes Allehanda's office in √ñrebro to protest against the publication. On 31 August, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt commented on the issue and said: \\"I think it's important to say two things. First, we are eager to ensure that Sweden remains a country in which Muslims and Christians, people who believe in God and people who don't believe in God, can live side by side in a spirit of mutual respect [...] We are also eager to stand up for freedom of expression, which is enshrined in the constitution and comes naturally to us, and which ensures that we do not make political decisions about what gets published in the newspapers. I want to make sure we keep things that way.\\" The same day, around 300 demonstrators ‚Äì led by the Islamic Cultural Centre in √ñrebro ‚Äì assembled outside the offices of Nerikes Allehanda to protest against the newspaper's publication. On 7 September, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt met with ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries to discuss the issue. Reinfeldt said that he had \\"explained how Swedish society works and that we don't have elected representatives making editorial decisions\\", adding that \\"this is an open country, a tolerant country\\". Prior to the meeting, Egyptian ambassador Mohamed Sotouhi said, according to the news agency TT, that he and a group of fellow ambassadors had agreed on a list of measures that Sweden needed to take and to present it to the Prime Minister. \\"We want to see action, not just nice words. We have to push for a change in the law\\", he said. After the meeting however, Reinfeldt denied that any such list had been presented to him. According to the Syrian Arab News Agency, a statement had been delivered from the Swedish embassy in Damascus to Syria's Grand Mufti Ahmad Bader Hassoun in which Reinfeldt \\"expressed his regret of the incident which has offended and upset Muslims, calling against instigating or offending other religions\\". The Swedish government has not commented on this statement. One of Vilks's original three drawings, depicting Muhammad as a roundabout dog. Also on 7 September, a group of about 550 Muslims gathered outside the offices of the newspaper Upsala Nya Tidning in Uppsala, to protest against the newspaper's publication of the cartoons.  Threats and attacks  Following the publication in Nerikes Allehanda, the Swedish police raised the security level around the newspaper's headquarters and some of its employees have been forced to use bodyguards after receiving death threats. Vilks himself has also received several death threats. One Muslim woman in western Sweden has been arrested on charges of issuing a death threat () against Vilks in an e-mail. The woman confirmed in police interrogation that she had written the mail and said that she did not have any regrets about it. On 6 September, one actual roundabout dog created by Vilks and local children was set alight as an apparent threat.The Local ‚Äì Sculpture by controverial [sic] artist set on fire On 15 September, it was reported that the group Islamic State of Iraq had placed a bounty of at least $100,000 on the head of Lars Vilks and 50,000 dollars on Ulf Johansson, editor-in-chief of Nerikes Allehanda. The statement was found in an audio file on an Islamist website and was read by a person who identified himself as Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the purported head of the Islamic State of Iraq. \\"We announce a reward of $100,000 to anyone who kills this infidel criminal. This reward will be raised to $150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb,\\" the statement said. The statement also threatened attacks on Swedish companies unless unspecified \\"crusaders\\" issued an apology. Vilks responded to the statement by saying: \\"I suppose this makes my art project a bit more serious. It's also good to know how much one is worth\\". The United States-based SITE Institute has reported that websites run by militant Islamists have listed the names of over 100 Swedish companies with addresses, maps and logos. The websites called for their readers to boycott these firms and \\"take revenge\\" on Sweden for the publication of the drawings. The European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) and the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe (FIOE) both condemned the death threats against Vilks and Johansson. ECFR also said it planned to issue a \\"counter fatwa\\" against the threats. The World Association of Newspapers (WAN), which represents over 18,000 newspapers around the world, issued a statement where it condemned the death threats and expressed support for Nerikes Allehanda in its right to publish the drawing.  9 March 2010 arrests  On 9 March 2010, seven people were arrested in the Republic of Ireland over an alleged plot to assassinate Vilks. The arrested were originally from Morocco and Yemen and had refugee status. Of the seven, three men and two women were arrested in Waterford and Tramore and another man and woman at Ballincollig, near Cork. Garda S√≠och√°na (the Irish police force), which conducted the arrests with support from the counter- terror Special Detective Unit and the National Support Services, said the suspects range in age from mid 20s to late 40s. They (Garda S√≠och√°na) also added that throughout the investigation they had been \\"working closely with law enforcement agencies in the United States and in a number of European countries\\". The same day, Colleen R. LaRose from the Philadelphia, US, suburbs, had her federal indictment unsealed charging her with trying to recruit Islamic terrorists to murder Vilks.  2010 Stockholm bombings  An emailed threat sent to a news agency and to the Swedish Security Service occurred made reference to this incident.\\"Suspected suicide bomb in central Stockholm injures two and panics shoppers\\"\\"Stockholm explosions leave one dead and two injured\\" Afterwards, two bombs exploded, injuring two people and killing the would-be attacker.  2010 Copenhagen terror plot  At the time of the December 2010 terror arrests, Lars Vilks' home page was subject to a hacker attack. According to Vilks' blog, the hacker declared the attacks would be continued with no end and that the targets are Vilks, Kurt Westergaard, and Geert Wilders.Lars Vilks blog, Del 1138: Efter senaste hacket  2013 Al- Qaeda's most wanted  In 2013, cartoonist St√©phane \\"Charb\\" Charbonnier was added to Al-Qaeda's most wanted list, along with Lars Vilks and three Jyllands-Posten staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose.  2015 Copenhagen shootings  On 14 February 2015, shots were fired at a public meeting in Denmark attended by Vilks, leaving one civilian dead and three policemen wounded.https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/14/us- denmark-shooting-idUSKBN0LI0N720150214 The attacker fled after a brief gunfight with police and was later shot dead the next day after committing another shooting at a Jewish synagogue, killing one person and injuring two policemen.

The group holds regional races at local race tracks including Road America, Blackhawk Farms Raceway, Gingerman Raceway, Grattan Raceway Park, Milwaukee Mile and Autobahn Country Club among others. The group's rulesets and car classifications are similar to the SCCA with minor but distinct differences. Midwestern Council prides itself on a family-friendly atmosphere and emphasis is on fun and safety first. Safety has always been paramount, and the combination of thorough driver training, tough stewarding and sensible competition has given the group over thirty seasons of fatality- free racing. Midwestern Council celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008, which makes it one of the longest existing amateur racing organizations in the United States. \\"Council\\" as it is colloquially named has parallel history to several long-running and historically significant racetracks in the Wisconsin and Illinois area.  Club affiliation  Seven distinct clubs combined in order to provide a more cost-effective method of controlling track rental fees and a more consistent competition field size. They include: * Salt Creek Sports Car Club (SCSCC) * Chicagoland Sports Car Club (CSCC) * Great Lakes Sport Car Club (GLSCC) * Lakeshore Sports Car Club (LSCC) * Madison Sports Car Club (MSCC) * North Suburban Sports Car Club (NSSCC) * Sports Car Club of Rockford (SCCR)  Types of racing  Midwestern council supports wheel-to- wheel style circuit-track racing, high speed autocross, lap days and holds several annual schools to teach drivers how to be responsible on track with other competitors. Among the many types of cars invited to attend a Midwestern Council weekend are Vintage Historics. Cars fitting a certain historical pedigree are allowed to compete in their own race group and maintain a special consideration of passing rules. While there are dedicated vintage clubs and events there are no sanctioned events where both modern vehicles and vintage vehicles are accommodated in the same day. The final wheel-to-wheel event of the season is the locally well-known \\"That Loooong Race\\" - a 100 mile mini- enduro wheel to wheel race at Blackhawk Farms Raceway. The two-day event features six race groups, trick-or-treating and big wheel races for the kids, Saturday worker rides and free crew/guest admission. The race has been held for 46 years and is hosted/sponsored by the Chicagoland Sports Car Club.  Notable members  While the Council's emphasis has always been \\"on fun and not as a breeding ground of racing heroes\\", some of the more notable members of Midwestern Council's history are listed below: *Rick Dittman and Bruce Nesbitt have been Trans-Am regulars after getting their start in Midwestern Council. *John Mahler raced at Indy after attending a Midwestern Council school. *Mike Rahal, Bobby Rahal's father. *Horst Kwech, 2.5 Trans-Am champion, and later a Ford factory team driver, was a North Suburban Sports Car Club member/racer. *John Welch, Bill Vincent and Bob Dupre, all MC members, set up a race team to compete in the single-seater Can-Am series and ran several events. *Augie Pabst and Harry Heuer raced Scarabs and Chaparrals with MC at Meadowdale and Milwaukee State Fair Park. *Burt \\"B.S.\\" Levy creator of The Last Open Road, a series of racing fiction books inspired by real-life events.

They were used to impose the acreable rent called the Quit Rent, which was payable yearly on lands granted under terms of the Acts of Settlement and Explanation. It is possible to discover to whom, if anyone, the confiscated lands were granted so that we have a record of landowners for 1641 and 1680. As a result, it is possible to determine the amount of lands lost by the 1641 owners after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and to discover the names of the new proprietors. The Books of Survey and Distribution form part of the Annesley Papers (ref D.1854).Public Record Office of Northern Ireland They consist of 22 volumes and each volume includes an 'alphabet' which is an index of denominations. The text includes a physical description of each barony, with details of woods, bogs, rivers, soil, etc. The information is laid out in tabular form on a barony and parish basis. The details include: \\"Proprietors in 1641 by the Civil Survey\\", \\"Denominations of lands by the Downe Survey\\", \\"Number of acres distributed\\", \\"persons to whom distributed\\" and \\"Rent per annum payable to His Majesty\\".

Brigadier general ranks immediately above colonel and below a major general. The rank is equivalent to rear admiral (lower half) in the Swedish Navy. History In 1972, the so-called employment reform (tj√§nstst√§llningsreformen) was implemented. In connection with the Swedish Armed Forces' increasing involvement in international operations with UN battalions and observers, it became increasingly clear that the Swedish service system did not quite correspond to what was common in other countries. A Swedish captain had basically the same training and service as a major in other countries' defense forces. In many cases, a Swedish colonel had tasks that in other armed forces were performed by brigadier generals. During the 1960s, this was solved many times by the Swedish officers being given a higher rank during their service abroad. The Supreme Commander suggested to the Swedish government that the Swedish service system should be changed, so that the captains would receive the rank of major and the majors would receive the rank of lieutenant colonel. He further proposed that a new general, brigadier general, be introduced. The government approved the Supreme Commander's proposal regarding captains and majors. No new general rank was introduced. The motivation for the government not following the Supreme Commander's proposal in this respect was that it did not want to contribute to an increase in the number of generals and admirals in the Swedish Armed Forces. However, the government decided to introduce the rank of √∂verste av 1. graden (senior colonel) for the army and kommend√∂r av 1. graden (senior captain) for the navy. The reform was implemented on 1 July 1972. During the 1990s, the Swedish government raised the issue of introducing a rank for professional officers called brigadier general and flotilla admiral, respectively, and stated there, among other things, the following. For a few years, the Swedish Armed Forces had in various ways announced that they wished to change the current rank level system for professional officers. The idea was that the rank of √∂verste av 1. graden and kommend√∂r av 1. graden would be abolished and instead replaced with the rank of brigadier general and rear admiral (lower half). The reason for this was stated to be that then almost only Sweden did not have this rank. The increased international cooperation was thus considered to have been made more difficult. Denmark, Norway and Finland had recently introduced the brigadier general's rank. The government stated in the same bill that the issue should be prepared further before a position was taken on the proposal. In 1999, the government stated that the said rank should now be introduced and intended to make changes to the bill (1994:642) with instructions for the Swedish Armed Forces and the Officers Ordinance (1994:882) with effect from 1 July 2000. The rank was finally introduced in 2000 and replaced the old rank of √∂verste av 1. graden. Anyone who, according to older regulations, held the rank of √∂verste av 1. graden would continue to hold that rank until otherwise decided. Thus, the rank of √∂verste av 1. graden was placed between the rank of brigadier general and the rank of colonel. Unlike major generals, lieutenant generals, vice admirals and rear admirals which are appointed by the government, brigadier general are appointed by the Swedish Armed Forces themselves. In everyday speech, generals of all ranks are addressed as generals. The rank is translated officially by the Swedish Armed Forces to Brigadier General. However, almost all officers in this rank do not command brigades, regiments or battalions; but take up senior tasks related to administration, staff, education, planning. Each of the (F)HQ units available (see Swedish Armed Forces) supports a unit which is commanded by a Brigadier General.

There are two variants, OX1 and OX2, each encoded by a different gene (, ). Both orexin receptors exhibit a similar pharmacology - the 2 orexin peptides, orexin-A and orexin-B, bind to both receptors and, in each case, agonist binding results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels. However, orexin-B shows a 10-fold selectivity for orexin receptor type 2, whilst orexin-A is equipotent at both receptors. Several orexin receptor antagonists are in development for potential use in sleep disorders. The first of these, Suvorexant, has been on the market in the United States since 2015. There are two orexin agonists under development.  Synthetic ligands  Several drugs acting on the orexin system are under development, either orexin agonists for the treatment of conditions such as narcolepsy, or orexin antagonists for insomnia. In August 2015, Nagahara et al published their work in synthesizing the first HCRT/OX2R agonist, compound 26, with good potency and selectivity. No neuropeptide agonists are yet available, although synthetic Orexin-A polypeptide has been made available as a nasal spray and tested on monkeys. One non-peptide antagonist is currently available in the U.S., Merck's suvorexant (Belsomra),; two additional agents are in development: SB-649,868 by GlaxoSmithKline, for sleep disorders, and ACT-462206, currently in human clinical trials. Another drug in development, almorexant (ACT-078573) by Actelion, was abandoned due to adverse effects.

It is a reboot of the Friday the 13th film series, which began in 1980, and is the twelfth installment. Nispel also directed the 2003 remake of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), while Shannon and Swift wrote the screenplay for the 2003 crossover Freddy vs. Jason. The film was produced by Platinum Dunes and Crystal Lake Entertainment and distributed by New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures. It stars Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Aaron Yoo, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle, and Derek Mears and follows Clay Miller (Padalecki) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney (Righetti), who is captured by Jason Voorhees (Mears) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake. The film was originally conceived as an origin story, but the project evolved into a re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status. Friday the 13th was theatrically released in the United States on February 13, 2009, by New Line Cinema in North American territories and by Paramount Pictures internationally. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that it did not add anything new to the franchise. Despite this, it grossed $92.7 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise after Freddy vs. Jason. Plot On June 13, 1980, a young Jason Voorhees watches as his mother Pamela is beheaded by a camp counselor, who was trying to escape Mrs. Voorhees's murder spree around Camp Crystal Lake. Almost thirty years later, a group of friendsWade, Richie, Mike, Whitney and Amandaarrive at Crystal Lake on a camping trip to search for a crop of marijuana growing in the woods. That night, an adult Jason kills everyone except Whitney, whom he captures since she resembles his mother at a young age. Six weeks later, Trent, his girlfriend Jenna and friends Chelsea, Bree, Chewie, Nolan, and Lawrence arrive at Trent's summer cabin on the shore of Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Whitney's brother Clay Miller arrives at the lake to search for her. Clay visits Trent's cabin, and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney. Chelsea and Nolan go wakeboarding on the lake; Jason kills Nolan with an arrow, and fatally stabs Chelsea with a machete. Meanwhile, Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds, where they see Jason hauling a body into the abandoned camp house. Jenna and Clay run back to the cabin to warn the others about Jason. Chewie is killed by Jason in a tool shed near the cabin, while Trent and Bree have sex in a bedroom. Jenna and Clay arrive, and Clay calls the police. Jason then disconnects the cabin's electricity. Lawrence heads outside to search for Chewie, and Jason kills him with an axe. Jason then sneaks inside and kills Bree. A police officer arrives and knocks on the front door, but is killed by Jason before he can enter. Trent, Clay, and Jenna escape the cabin and become separated, and Trent is killed by Jason when he reaches the main road. Jason chases Clay and Jenna back to the campgrounds, where Clay discovers Jason's lair and finds his sister underground, chained to a wall. Clay frees Whitney, and all three try to escape as Jason arrives. They find an exit, but Jenna is killed before she can escape. Jason corners Clay and Whitney in a barn, and Whitney confuses Jason by pretending to be Pamela. Clay and Whitney subdue Jason with a length of chain, and Whitney stabs Jason in the chest with his own machete. After sunrise, Clay and Whitney dump Jason's body into the lake, but before they leave, Jason bursts through the wooden dock and grabs Whitney.

They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from Paramount Pictures, New Line and Crystal Lake Entertainmentthe latter run by Friday the 13th creator Sean S. Cunningham. Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films, including the title. Paramount was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U.S. distribution rights. Fuller and Form said they did not want to make Friday the 13th Part 11 or 12, but wanted to rework the mythology. They liked elements from the first four filmssuch as plot points and ways particular characters are killedand planned to use these in their remake, which they did with Paramount's approval. Fuller said, \\"I think there are moments we want to address, like how does the hockey mask happen. It'll happen differently in our movie than in the third one. Where is Jason from, why do these killings happen, and what is Crystal Lake?\\" The producers initially expressed an interest in using Tommy Jarvis, a recurring character who first appeared in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, but the idea was scrapped. Though the producers decided that Friday the 13th would not be an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head‚Äîsimilar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2‚Äîto finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it. Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which were also produced by Bay, Form, and Fullerit was decided that Friday the 13th would not be a period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s. In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th. Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel. Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project. Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas and ended on June 13, 2008. Additional scenes were shot on location at Camp Fern near Marshall, Texas. Casting Stuntman Derek Mears was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Before the producers contacted him, Mears had already heard about the production of a new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers. The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role. According to Mears, \\"They were like, 'You're really nice ... are you going to be able to switch over, right?' I was like, 'I cage fight... and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'\\". Mears said he related to \\"Jason the victim\\" when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film. To Mears, Jason represents people who were bullied in high schoolspecifically those with physical deformitiesfor being outcasts. Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake. When Mears went to audition for the role, he was asked, \\"Why do we need an actor as opposed to just a guy in a mask?\\" Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera. Amanda Righetti had not read the script when she was offered the role of Whitney Miller. She wanted to be part of the Friday the 13th franchise from the start. Righetti said she wanted to act in the film after she read the script. Jared Padalecki describes Clay Miller as a real hero because he sets out \\"to do the right thing\\" when his sister goes missing, and goes about it as a \\"lone wolf\\" who wants to take on the responsibility alone. Adjustments were made to the filming schedule to accommodate Aaron Yoo, who portrays Chewie. Yoo had his appendix removed shortly before filming began, and could not film his scenes immediately. As soon as Yoo was ready for filming, Nispel immediately hung him upside down from some rafters, exposing the staples over his surgical wound for the character's post-death shot. Fuller and Form said the casting process for Friday the 13th was more difficult than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. Hostel: Part II's Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes. Writing  When Shannon and Swift began writing the script for Friday the 13th, they imposed some rules based on their experiences of writing Freddy vs. Jason on themselves. They wanted their teenage characters to \\"sound normal\\". Shannon and Swift said they did not want the characters to know Jason's name or to become what they considered \\"the Scooby-Doo clich√© where it's a bunch of kids trying to figure something out\\". The writers also wanted to distance themselves from self-referential slasher films such as Scream and to give the film a gritty, more 1980s feel that had been lost in recent films. They wanted to create a quick, loose Jason. The writing team decided to create a version of Jason \\"who was actually in the woods surviving off the land\\", and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along. The writers did not want to spend a lot of time covering Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost $100,000. Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned. The writers had written a scene in which Willa Ford's character Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore. Eventually, the girl would tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral. A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a \\"cute line\\" about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death. The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in installments of the previous series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark (Tom McBride) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of Friday the 13th. The writers altered Jason's character. Mears describes him as a combination of John Rambo, Tarzan, and the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes. To Mears, Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film. However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would \\"demystify\\" the character in an unhelpful manner. Fuller said, \\"We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple.\\" Visual effects The producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for Friday the 13th. Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film. Mears being filmed performing the killing of Ben Feldman's character. Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete to show it being pulled away from Feldman's face. One of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a computer generated (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames. Another composite shot is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect. Asylum also enhanced some of Jason's signature machete kills. In several scenes, the company used a computer-generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters' deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths. In one scene, Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head. Instead of using a real machete with a fake head, Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handlewith only a portion of the blade attachedaway from Feldman's head. Then, Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect. For this scene, Asylum adjusted the actor's facial expressions to create a \\"post mortem\\" look. The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor's face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason's machete. Asylum digitally created weapons for various scenes. In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck. Creating Jason bust of Jason as seen in the film. Effects artist Scott Stoddard combined characteristics from Jason's appearance in Friday the 13th Part 2 and The Final Chapter when crafting his design. Effects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason's face as a combination of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make- up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up. For Jason's wardrobe, Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a \\"high-priced t-shirt\\" that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his \\"kill movements\\", so the top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket to create what Mears called a \\"giant Frankenstein jacket.\\" He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back. Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, \\"Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit. Break them up.\\" Music Form and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky he wanted him to create something that Nispel could \\"whistle when [he] left the theater\\", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, \\"I don't believe that, when you watch a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next to you with the London Symphony Orchestra\\". Release Theatrical On October 18, 2008, a teaser trailer of the film debuted at the 2008 Scream Awards and was released online, three days later.

Critical response Based on 173 reviews collected by review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Friday the 13th has a 26% approval rating from critics with an average score of 4.2/10. The consensus reads: \\"Though technically well-constructed, Friday the 13th is a series rehash that features little to distinguish it from its predecessors.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 34 based on 29 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that average grade cinemagoers gave the film a \\"B-\\" on a scale of A+ to F. Exit polls showed that 51% of the audience was male and 59% were at least 25 years old. The comic relief of Aaron Yoo's performance as the marijuana-smoking Chewie was praised by some critics. Alonso Duralde wrote that the film should please slasher fans, but that it added nothing new to the genre or the franchise and would not appeal to people who did not like slasher films. Duralde criticized the film for adding a black and an Asian character in an attempt to \\"update the movie for the new millennium\\". He also said the prospect of another Friday the 13thcrafted by the film's \\"sequel-friendly\\" endingdid not leave him with a feeling of dread. Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said the film accepts the \\"ridiculousness\\" of what it is trying to accomplishmainly the \\"death and dismemberment\\" of \\"party-hungry kids\\", and that audiences would enjoy it if they also recognized that. Although Goodykoontz acknowledges the unique touches the film brings to certain characters' deaths, he was unimpressed with the acting and said Padalecki's presence gave the film a \\"less-good episode of Supernatural\\" vibe. The Washington Post's Dan Zak wrote that the film fails to provide laughs, scares, suspense, or gore. Zak also said it fails to provide the exhibition of nudity expected of horror films that cannot deliver on the previously listed criteria. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said Nispel captured the despair he created with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Olsen also said the film failed to provide the \\"giddiness\\", \\"teenage lust\\", and \\"rambunctiousness\\" that made the previous Friday the 13th films work. Wesley Morris said Friday the 13th did have humor; he said the characters continually act the clich√©d role of would-be-victim, making it hard to fear for their safety. In his opinion, the 2009 film lacked the \\"psycho-social\\" aspecta mother killing out of revenge for her son's deathcrafted by its 1980 predecessor, and ultimately the film is \\"more hilarious than terrifying\\". The New York Post's Kyle Smith said Nispel made no attempt to create a movie beyond blood and guts, and even those attempts were \\"forgettable\\". Smith said that apart from Clay and Trent, the rest of the cast were merely \\"faces in the crowd\\" with no attempt to give them any sort of backstory. USA Today's Claudia Puig said that the film keeps to the same formula as its predecessors, with a story that adds little to nothing to the franchise. She also said Padalecki and Panabaker filled their lead roles well, and that Aaron Yoo's comic relief made him one of the most likable characters on screen. Rob Nelson of Variety also praised Panabaker and Yoo's performances. In contrast to the film's detractors, The New York Times's Nathan Lee said Friday the 13th managed to \\"reboot the concept\\" of the original films with style. Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters, that there is a desire among cinemagoers for this type of material, and that Friday the 13th satisfies that desire. Adam Graham from The Detroit News said that it is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the 13th franchise; he praised its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victimsas opposed to slowly walking behind them, as became prominent in later sequelsbecause it made him more menacing. Graham also said the film does not \\"soften\\" Jason's scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times explained his review of the film, he stated: \\"It will come as little surprise that Jason still lives in the woods around Crystal Lake and is still sore about the death of his mom. Jason must be sore in general\\". Entertainment Weekly's Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night (2008) and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), although it does provide a few too many unbelievable character moments. Jason Anderson of the Toronto Star said the film added freshness to the standard formula of the previous films by focusing on the chasing and killing aspects instead of lingering on the prolonged suffering of victims like the Saw films. IGN's Chris Carle said Aaron Yoo stole the film with his comic timing and with his \\"memorable death\\". Carle said Derek Mears' portrayal of Jason adds more to the character than being simply a stuntman; Mears's subtle movements, athleticism, and physicality created an imposing image of Jason.

However, things are never fine in the world of soap operas. Eddie Connors, Paula and Ricardo's fellow officer, always wanted Paula for himself. When Paula accidentally saw him in a jewelry store, he thought she was on to him, so he decided to teach her a lesson by kidnapping her and then paying Ralph Myers, a criminal, to torture her. Ricardo went through hard time trying to find his fiance. She was barely saved from a van filled with gas. The next few weeks she spent trying to deal with the rape and putting Ralph behind bars. During her kidnapping, Ricardo met Gabi Martinez, an attractive woman who spent a night with Ricardo and then later it turned out that Gabi was Paula's sister. Gabi moved in with Paula and Ricardo and did her best to mess with Ricardo's mind. When Paula and Ricardo broke up, Ricardo slept with Gabi, and Gabi was confused after they had sex and eventually accused Ricardo of raping her. For Paula, it was something that she just couldn't get through. Although it was proven that Ricardo was innocent, Paula decided to leave town by the end of 1997. In 1998, Ricardo became closer with Gabi, as they realized that they loved each other. However, Gabi soon fell in love with Ricardo's brother Antonio, but they both rejected their attraction. Meanwhile, Ricardo's mother Carmen constantly tried to warn Ricardo to leave Gabi. During the Shockwave storyline, Ricardo found himself on the boat along with other Sunset Beach people. The boat suffered the same tragedy as Titanic, but the people rescued themselves just in time. Months later, Ricardo was involved in two other storylines---his sister Maria returned home after being presumed dead in 1993, and he often confronted Maria's husband Ben about it. He was also involved in a Rosario Jewels storyline. In 1999, Ricardo was convinced that everything was going fine. Gabi and him decided to get married, but he didn't know that Gabi slept with his brother when they found themselves trapped in an exploded building. Carmen blackmailed Gabi to stop the wedding, but Gabi and Ricardo eventually got married. Days later, Ricardo was shocked to find a tape of Gabi and Antonio together. The shock of this overwhelmed him. He suffered a stroke and was hospitalized, after which he did everything he could to make Gabi's life a disaster. He also tried to deport his brother Antonio. Eventually, Ricardo forgave them both, and Gabi left town at the very last episode.

Long thought to be lost this historical document was retrieved among the papers of renowned sports journalist Gianni Brera (himself a Genoa supporter) after his death and donated back to the club by his relatives. The club was founded on 7 September 1893 as Genoa Cricket & Athletic Club. In its earliest years, they principally competed in athletics and cricket. Association football was secondly practised. Since the club was set up to represent England abroad, the original shirts worn by the organisation were white, the same colour as the England national team shirt. At first Italians were not permitted to join as it was a private club. Genoa's activities took place in the north-west of the city in the Campasso area, at the Piazza d'Armi.

It was amongst the oldest in Italian football as at the time, the only other founded clubs were four in Turin. Italians were allowed to join and they found a new ground in the form of Ponte Carrega. The first friendly match took place at home, against a mixed team of Internazionale Torino and FBC Torinese; Genoa lost 1‚Äì0. Not long after, Genoa recorded their first victory away against UPS Alessandria winning 2‚Äì0. Friendly games also took place against various British sailors such as those from . Historical outline Championship dominance Genoa CAC in 1898, the first ever Italian Championship winners. Football in Italy stepped up a level with the creation of the Italian Football Federation and the Italian Football Championship. Genoa competed in the first Italian Championship in 1898 at Velodromo Umberto I in Turin. They defeated Ginnastica Torino 2‚Äì1 in their first official game on 8 May, before winning the first championship later that day by beating Internazionale Torino 3‚Äì1 after extra time. Genoa returned for the following season, this time with a few changes; the name of the club was altered to Genoa Cricket & Football Club, dropping the Athletic from its name. A change in shirt colour was also in order, as they changed to white and blue vertical stripes; known in Italy as biancoblu. Genoa won their second title on 16 April 1899, by beating Internazionale Torino 3‚Äì1 for the second time. On their way to winning their third consecutive title in 1900 and proving their championship dominance, Genoa beat local rivals Sampierdarenese 7‚Äì0; a winning margin which would not be bettered by any team in the league until 1910. The final was secured with a 3‚Äì1 win over FBC Torinese. The club strip was changed again in 1901, Genoa adopted its famous red-navy halves and therefore became known as the rossoblu; these are the colours used even to this day. After a season of finishing runners-up to Milan Cricket and Football Club, things were back on track in 1902 with their fourth title. Juventus emerged as serious contenders to Genoa's throne from 1903 onwards, when for two seasons in a row Genoa beat the Old Lady in the national final. Genoa CFC championship winning side of 1904, their sixth league title. Notably Genoa became the first Italian football team to play an international match, when they visited France on 27 April 1903 to play FVC Nice, winning the fixture 3‚Äì0. As well as winning the Italian championship in 1904, the year was also notable for Genoa reserves winning the first ever II Categoria league season; a proto-Serie B under the top level. From 1905 onwards when they were runners-up, Genoa lost their foothold on the Italian championship; other clubs such as Juventus, Milan and Pro Vercelli stepped up. The fall in part during this period can be traced back to 1908 when FIGC agreed to Federal Gymnastics protests forbidding the use of foreign players. Since Genoa's birth they had always had a strong English contingent. They disagreed, as did several other prominent clubs such as Milan, Torino and Firenze; as thus they withdrew from official FIGC competitions that year. The following season the federation reversed the decision and Genoa was rebuilt with players such as Luigi Ferraris and some from Switzerland. The rebuilding of the squad also saw the creation of a new ground in the Marassi area of Genoa; when built it had a capacity of 25,000 and was comparable to British stadiums of the time; it was officially opened on 22 January 1911. Garbutt revival With the introduction of the Italian national football team, Genoa played an important part, with the likes of Renzo De Vecchi; who was azzurri captain for some time, Edoardo Mariani and Enrico Sardi earning call-ups. Englishman William Garbutt was brought in as head coach to help revive the club; Garbutt was the first professional manager in Italy and he was considered to have a strong charisma, constantly smoking his tobacco pipe. He was dubbed \\"Mister\\" by the players; since then Italians have referred to coaches in general with the term. Finally by 1914‚Äì15, Genoa had restored themselves as the top club from Northern Italy, winning the final round of the Northern section. However, a national final was not played because Genoa did not have an opposition; the finals of the Southern Italian section was not decided due to the outbreak of World War I. Genoa would be awarded the title in 1919 after the end of the war, it was their first for eleven seasons. The war took a harsh toll on Genoa as players Luigi Ferraris, Adolfo Gnecco, Carlo Marassi, Alberto Sussone and Claudio Casanova all died while on military duty in Italy; while footballing founder James Richardson Spensley was killed in Germany. The last Genoa side to win the Italian Football Championship, in 1924. Just after the war, Genoa remained a strong contender in the Northern section. Garbutt led Genoa to championship success in 1922‚Äì23 where they beat Lazio 6‚Äì1 in the final, over the course of two legs. The following season, Genoa made their way past Bologna in the Northern finals, but not without controversy; after riots in the second leg during the game in Bologna, the game was called off due to crowd rioting and FIGC awarded Genoa with a 2‚Äì0 victory. In the national final that season, Genoa beat Savoia 4-1 over the course of two legs; this would be their ninth and to date final Italian championship. The squad during these two championship victories included; Giovanni De Pr√†, Ottavio Barbieri, Luigi Burlando and Renzo De Vecchi. With Genoa's championship victory in 1923‚Äì24 came the introduction of the scudetto patch; which means following the season which a club wins an Italian league championship, they are allowed to wear a shield shaped patch on their shirt which features the colours of the Italian flag. For the rest of the 1920s, the club did not win the championship, with the highest they were able to finish being second place, like in the 1927‚Äì28 season when they finished runners-up to Torino, with striker Felice Levratto scoring 20 goals in 27 games. Genova 1893 period Due to the strongly British connotations attached to the name, Genoa were forced to change it by the fascist government to Genova 1893 Circolo del Calcio in 1928. The club competed in a proto-European Cup in the form of the Mitropa Cup, where they went out in the quarter-finals after losing heavily to Rapid Vienna. They followed this with a runners-up position back at home in the league, they finished behind Ambrosiana in the 1929‚Äì30 season; this would be their last top level championship runners-up spot to date. Genoa Coppa Italia winning side of 1937, celebrating in Florence. The club's league form became highly erratic during the early 1930s, with varying league positions; it was during the 1933‚Äì34 season that Genova suffered their first ever relegation to Serie B, the second level of Italian football. Thankfully for the club, they were able to bounce back under the management of Vittorio Faroppa, winning promotion by finishing top of their group ahead of Novara. In 1936, the ambitious Juan Culiolo took over as president of the club; in 1936‚Äì37 they achieved a 6th-place finish and also won the Coppa Italia by beating AS Roma 1‚Äì0 with a goal from Mario Torti. During the following season Genova finished in third place, this was a particularly tight season with winners Ambrosiana-Inter finishing only three points ahead of the club. That summer Italy competed in the 1938 FIFA World Cup and won, three Genova players formed part of the triumphant squad in the form of Sergio Bertoni, Mario Genta and Mario Perazzolo. The club finished the decade on a high, maintaining a top five foothold in the top level of the Italian league. World War II affected dramatically the entire Italian football movement, but Genova did not recover as well as other clubs. In 1945, the club chose to revert their name to Genoa Cricket and Football Club, the one which they had used in the very early days of the Italian championship. In the years just after the war, the club were still popular with the fans, with people previously associated with the club such as Ottavio Barbieri and William Garbutt returning for managerial spells. Genoa also had a new rival in the form of Sampdoria, who were founded by a merger of two other clubs in 1946 and would groundshare at Stadio Luigi Ferraris.  Post-war period  Genoa side during 1956‚Äì57 season. After the Second World War the ability of Genoa to finish in the upper ranks of Serie A declined in a significant manner; throughout the rest of the 1940s the club were middle-table finishers. The 1948‚Äì49 saw three highly significant results, Genoa beat Inter 4‚Äì1, the famous Grande Torino side 3‚Äì0 and Padova 7‚Äì1. The 1950s started in poor fashion for the club, they had bought Argentine Mario Boy√© from Boca Juniors but he stayed only one season and the club were relegated after finishing bottom of the table, but after two seasons they achieved their return after winning Serie B, ahead of Legnano. Ragnar Nikolay Larsen was a noted player for the club during this period and they sustained mid-table finishes for the rest of the decade. Despite suffering a relegation in 1959‚Äì60 and then a promotion back up to Serie A in 1961‚Äì62, Genoa had a respectable amount of cup success in the first half of the 1960s. The club won the Coppa delle Alpi in 1962; it was the first time the competition had been competed between club teams instead of international ones, the final was played at home while Genoa beat French club Grenoble Foot 38 by 1‚Äì0 with a goal from Nizza. Genoa won the same competition again two years later, the final was held at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland; Genoa defeated Catania 2‚Äì0, with both goals from Giampaolo Piaceri to take the trophy. The celebrations for the club did not last long however, as the year following their last cup success they were relegated down to Serie B again. This time their stay at the second tier of the Italian football system would be far longer than previous relegations, the club was unstable as it changed manager each season. Genoa even experienced their first relegation to Serie C in 1970, financially the club fell into difficulties and had several ownership changes. Mixed times Throughout the 1970s, Genoa would play the role of a yo-yo club, bouncing up and down between divisions. Under the management of Arturo Silvestri the club made its way back to Serie A for the 1973‚Äì74 season, but they were relegated straight back down. For the return of Il Grifone to Serie A a couple of seasons later, the squad featured the likes of Roberto Rosato, Bruno Conti and a young Roberto Pruzzo. This time they stuck it out in the top division for two seasons before succumbing to relegation in 1977‚Äì78; the relegation was particularly cruel as the side above them Fiorentina survived on goal-difference of just a single goal, the two teams had played each other on the final day of the season ending in a 0‚Äì0 draw. First Genoa side of the 1980s. The relegation was bad for the club in more ways than one, they lost some of their top players who could have offered them a swift return; such as Roberto Pruzzo's move to AS Roma where he would go on to have great success. After a couple of middle-table finishes in Serie B, Genoa earned promotion during the 1980‚Äì81 season under manager Luigi Simoni, the club finished as runners-up behind only AC Milan who had been relegated the previous season for their part in the Totonero betting scandal. Still with Simoni at the helm as manager, Genoa were able to survive in Serie A for their returning season, they finished just one point ahead of the relegated AC Milan, it was a dramatic last day of the season as Genoa were trailing 2‚Äì1 to SSC Napoli with five minutes left, until on the 85th minute Mario Faccenda scored the goal which secured the point Genoa needed, starting a friendship between the two club's fans. A couple of seasons later in 1983‚Äì84 Genoa would not be so lucky, despite beating champions Juventus on the final day of the season, the club were relegated even though they finished the season with the same number of points as surviving Lazio; this was because Lazio had recorded better results in matches against Genoa. European experience The club was purchased by Calabrian entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in 1985 and despite no longer having Simoni as manager, Genoa were finishing in the top half of Serie B. After a slip in form during 1987‚Äì88, Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A the following season, finishing as champions ahead of Bari. Genoa achieved highs during the 1990‚Äì91 season where they finished fourth, remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign, winning games against all the big sides including Juventus, Inter, AC Milan, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, SSC Napoli, as well as their hated local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season. Subsequently, the club gained entry to the UEFA Cup in the 1991‚Äì92 season, Genoa had a good run, making it to the semi-finals before getting knocked out by Ajax; notably Genoa did the double over Liverpool in the quarter-finals becoming the first Italian side to beat the reds at Anfield. Noted Genoa players during this period included Gianluca Signorini, Carlos Aguilera, Stefano Eranio, Roberto Onorati and John van 't Schip. Back in Serie A however, due to a limited roster of first-line players the team suffered heavily from the very success they enjoyed in the UEFA competition (which meant more matches to be played for the same athletes and fatiguing trips to Spain, Romania -twice-, England and the Netherlands), so Genoa finished just one place above the relegation zone; in the seasons following Genoa remained in the lower half of the table. During the 1994‚Äì95 season Genoa were narrowly relegated, they finished level on points with Padova after the normal season period. This meant a relegation play-out was to be played between the two in Florence, the game was tied 1‚Äì1 at full-time and went to a penalty shootout, Genoa eventually lost the shoot-out 5‚Äì4. While back down in Serie B, the club had another taste of international cup success when they became the final winners of the Anglo-Italian Cup by beating Port Vale 5‚Äì2 with Gennaro Ruotolo scoring a hat-trick. Chairman Spinelli sold Genoa in 1997, moving onto Livorno. The late 1990s and early 2000s would be the most trying time in the history of the club, cwith constantly changing managers, a poor financial situation and little hope of gaining promotion, outside of a decent 6th-place finish in 1999‚Äì00. From 1997 until 2003, Genoa had a total of three different four different chairmen, before the club was passed on to Enrico Preziosi. Recent times After the take-over in 2003, things started to look up for Genoa; they won Serie B in 2004‚Äì05. However, allegations were raised that the club had fixed a match on the last day of the season between themselves and Venezia. The 3‚Äì2 victory in the match saw Genoa win the league, if they had lost they would have finished behind three other teams (it has to be noted that the match looked hard-fought and grimly contested to the last minute, hardly a fixed-up one). The Disciplinary Committee of FIGC however saw fit to place Genoa bottom of the league and relegate them down to Serie C1 on 27 July 2005. For their season in Serie C1 for 2005‚Äì06, Genoa were hit with a six- point penalty from the previous season. After leading for much of the season, they eventually finished as runners-up and were entered into the play-offs, beating Monza 3‚Äì0 on aggregate to achieve promotion back into Serie B. During the summer break Gian Piero Gasperini was brought in as the new manager, he helped the club to gain promotion during the 2006‚Äì07 season, it was ensured on the last day of the season where they drew 0‚Äì0 with Napoli, both sleeping giants were promoted back into Serie A. In the recent 2008-2009 championship Genoa started out with a defeat in the sicilian away match with Catania but was then graced with the comeback of Argentinian forward Diego Milito a talent which played with Genoa in second division and was then sold after the team had been relegated to third division despite finishing at the division's top due to an alleged combine. Milito was glad to come back to Genoa and play in Italy's Serie A and greatly contributed to a very successful season which saw the red and blue genoese griffins finishing fifth and securing a UEFA placement, while winning both derbies against the striped Sampdoria \\"cousins\\" and managing to defeat teams like Roma, Milan and Juventus. Genoa could have aimed even higher, but an unlucky streak of defeats with Lazio and Bologna right after having won against Juventus quashed their hopes for a Champions League spot. Having sold both Milito and midfield Thiago Motta to Inter Genoa has now 40 million euro to invest in suitable replacements to maintain a high standing in the coming Serie A season and to compete successfully in the UEFA cup.

The vocals are shared between Ian Moss and Jimmy Barnes. It just missed out on becoming the band's third Top 10 single, stalling at number 11 on the Australian chart for two weeks, but it remains one of Cold Chisel's highest charting songs. Details The album track features ambient noise recorded in Sydney's Kings Cross district, including the sound of motorbikes, strip club spruikers and crowds of drunks, recorded by author Don Walker on a portable stereo. Also recorded are Walker's favourite busker and a snippet of Dragon's \\"Rain\\". This version appears on later greatest hits album and is most frequently played on radio. The original single version omits the street sounds. Although Walker was unhappy with many of the songs from the Twentieth Century album, he later said he was particularly pleased with the production on \\"Saturday Night\\", which he was mostly responsible for. Don Walker has said of the song, \\"The band I'd been in for ten years was breaking up. I think it's just a 'kissing all that goodbye and moving on into the unknown' song.\\" He later said, \\"The song is actually about walking away from a Saturday night. The song was pretty much built before the other guys cottoned on to what I was doing. I can remember Mark Opitz suddenly saying, 'I get this, this is really good.'\\" Early drafts of the song were titled, \\"Show Me A Light\\". Author Michael P. Jensen said, \\"These guys were supposed to be bogan heroes, but they slip a little French into their songs. 'L'esclavage D'amour' is 'the slavery of love'. The deep longing of the man walking his way around the city on the busiest night of the week is matched by his loneliness.\\" \\"Saturday Night\\" spent 14 weeks in the national charts, peaking at number 11. The art work for the single was done by Chilean artist Eduardo Guelfenbein, who had also done the artwork for the album and a number of videos for the band. In 2007, Grinspoon covered \\"Saturday Night\\" for the tribute album Standing on the Outside. Kylie Auldist released a disco version in 2016. From the video, Ian Moss and Phil Small outside a strip club in Kings Cross Video A video clip for the track, directed by Richard Lowenstein, was filmed in Kings Cross in February 1984, three months after the group disbanded. Part of the clip features Moss and Barnes mingling with the participants of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Lowenstein said the idea came from his friend Troy Davies. \\"At the time it wasn‚Äôt so accepted for straight guys to go there. I think Troy was worried how they‚Äôd deal with his extrovert gayness. It was brave at the time to have the gay Mardi Gras in a Cold Chisel video on Countdown. That was Troy, he was a mischief maker. But Cold Chisel lapped it up,\\" Lowenstein said. Other sections of the clip showing the band members (minus Barnes) moving through the crowd of the Darlinghurst Road red light district. Lowenstein said, \\"I had a camera on the back of a station wagon, we‚Äôd just drive up and down the Cross and film in slow motion. The song suited that kind of imagery so well, I thought it was a no-brainer to put the down and outs and all the characters in. It was a quick shoot, maybe two nights.\\" Reception Reviewed in Juke Magazine at the time of release, it was described as, \\"Another of those sparse, atmospheric songs. They haven't lost their edge over all these years, which is really sayin' something.\\" Elsewhere, they called it, \\"an appealing track with many of Chisel's best qualities filtered through a clever mix. The melody relies heavily on Phil Small's excellent bass line\\". Marc Hunter, Paul Hewson and Robert Taylor reviewed the single for RAM, saying, \\"This shows why Chisel are a top band ‚Äî they're prepared to take chances. Ian Moss sings superbly; the band plays with restraint but perfect taste... Has to be a hit.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald called the song a \\"pleasant ballad\\" but noted \\"hard-core fans may take to the b-side, \\"Painted Doll\\", more readily\\". The Monthly said, \\"In many ways it represents the best of Cold Chisel. The music fades in slowly over the sound of voices and traffic, with an arrangement that borrows from soul (Marvin Gaye comes to mind), but isn‚Äôt quite that. Moss, the more melodious of Cold Chisel‚Äôs vocalists, takes the lead, with Barnes chipping in for an explosive interlude.

While the precise function of the urotensin II receptor is not fully known it has been linked to cardiovascular effects, stress, and REM sleep.  Ligands  There are two known endogenous agonists for the urotensin II receptor. One is urotensin II whose mRNA is found in a variety of tissues including the brain and also blood vessels. It is a potent vasoconstrictor and can increase REM cycles. The other is urotensin II-Related Peptide (URP) which is found in a variety of tissues as well although at less concentrations then urotensin II. The one exception is in human reproductive tissue where the levels of URP are much higher than urotensin II.  Cellular Pathway  left Urotensin II Receptor interacts with the G Protein whose alpha subunit is GŒ±q11 which is mainly involved in activating Protein Kinase C (PKC). This then activates phospholipase C which increases the intercellular amount of calcium through the activation of IP3 which is an intracellular molecule that acts as secondary messenger. IP3 will then release calcium which then activates PKC. When the urotensin II receptor is activated it also promotes beta arrestin translocation. Beta arrestin is important for ceasing the response of a receptor to a stimuli. Beta arrestin also brings with it other proteins that internalize the receptor which also helps in desensitizing the cell to the stimuli.  Tissue distribution  Based on RT-PCR techniques the urotensin II receptor appears to be expressed throughout the entire brain. On the other hand, when using in situ hybridization technique which is less sensitive but provides more information of the anatomical location urotensin II receptor mRNA was shown to be restricted to the brainstem cholinergic neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT) both of which are important for REM sleep. These two different results are because urotensin II receptor can also be found in blood vessels which is what the sensitive RT-PCR technique was likely detecting. Urotensin II receptors are also found in the cholinergic neurons of the spinal cord indicating some type of motor function. Urotensin II receptors have also been found in other peripheral tissues and blood vessels. This suggests some effects on the cardiovascular system.  Function   CNS  When the urotensin II receptor is activated through an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of urotensin II it causes an increase of corticotropin releasing factor through the activation of the hypothalamic paraventricular neurons (PVN) which lead to increased plasma levels of adrencorticotropic hormones. C-fos levels which go up whenever there is an increase in neural activity were detected in the brain 20 minutes after the urotensin II was injected. The stimulation of the PVN by the activation of urotensin II receptor means that it directly affects the hypothalamus pituitary axis (HPA) which is important in the regulation of many important body functions. Rats also exhibit many stress related behaviors when injected with urotensin II such as pacing and fidgeting in familiar environments. REM sleep is controlled by the cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT. Local injection of urotensin II into the PPT to leads to increased REM sleep episodes where the firing of the cholinergic neurons was observed through electrophysiological studies. The studies also showed there was no effect on the non-cholinergic neurons. Wakefulness and slow wave sleep were not affected by the activation of the urotensin II receptor.  Cardiovascular  Short term effects of the activation of the urotensin II receptor is the burst intercellular calcium in the aorta which causes vasoconstriction of the vessel. There is also evidence that there are long term effects of the activation of the urotensin II receptor which could play a role in cardiomyocitic hypertrophy.  Gene  Human urotensin II receptor is located on chromosome 17q25 as an intronless gene. There are no known subtypes of the receptor but the possibility cannot be discounted. It has similar domain sequences to the somatostatin receptor, and in lab conditions can be activated by somatostatin.  Clinical significance   Mutations  There is one single-nucleotide polymorphism that is known to occur in humans regarding the urotensin II receptor. R1483.50 is instead H1483.50 which effects how the cell responds when the urotensin II receptor is activated. The receptor cannot activate the PKC but it can still activate the ERK1/2 pathway although it is a little bit slower. There have been studies done on specific amino acids on the urotensin II receptor especially the ones that are homologous to the other members of the rhodopsin family. These include, D972.50, E1473.49, and Y1493.50. In all cases the amino acids were converted to alanine and their effects were observed. The mutated D972.50 receptor could not activate PKC nor could it activate the ERK1/2 pathway. This meant that it affected the activation of both pathways and plays a critical role. The other two amino acids which were mutated E1473.49 and Y1493.50 still activated both PKC and ERK1/2 suggesting that they did not play a critical role in the activation of the pathway.

Although she first appeared one month after the show premiere, Priscilla was credited in the show's opening credits from the beginning. Character history When she first came to Sunset Beach, Gabi immediately started trying to seduce Ricardo Torres, an engaged Police officer, and she continues flirting with him. Days later, Gabi found out that Ricardo's fianc√© was Paula Stevens, her half-sister. Gabi was well received by her half-sister, but Ricardo didn't have the same sympathy. Paula offered Gabi to stay with them in the apartment, where she continued trying to seduce Ricardo. Things got complicated when Ricardo and Gabi slept together, and Gabi accused Ricardo of raping her, which led to court. Paula was convinced that Gabi was telling the truth and she left Ricardo. Although Ricardo proved that he didn't rape Gabi, Paula decided to leave town with her mother. On her way to redemption, after realizing that she's being troubled by her past when her father raped her, Gabi decided to spend New Year's Eve on a mysterious island bought by Ben Evans for Meg Cummings, but a killer was present on the island. She survived. At the time, Gabi was becoming closer with Mark Wolper, a young D.J., but they never got a chance to develop their relationship because Mark was killed off during that storyline. In 1998, Gabi and Ricardo got closer although Ricardo's mother Carmen Torres didn't approve their relationship. Then Gabi met Antonio Torres, Ricardo's brother, a priest. Gabi and Antonio found themselves attracted to each other, but they kept denying the attraction. Antonio and Gabi were in love with each other. Ricardo and Gabi got engaged. Meanwhile, both Gabi, Antonio and Ricardo were involved in a Rosario jewels story. When Gabi and Antonio ended up trapped in an exploding building, they thought they would die and so they gave in to their love for each other and they slept together, and a camera filmed them. The tape of their sexual intercourse was later used by Francesca Vargas to blackmail Antonio and Gabi. When Francesca was killed, Gabi and Antonio were possible suspects, but they actually didn't have anything to do with her murder. At Gabi and Ricardo's wedding, Carmen used the tape of their lovemaking to blackmail Gabi into leaving Ricardo at the altar, but they eventually got married and everything was going fine until Ricardo found the tape and decided to destroy Gabi and Antonio's life. Eventually, Ricardo forgave them and Gabi decided to leave town and find good stuff somewhere else, giving up on her true love Antonio.

History The prototype of the Potez 62 made its maiden flight on January 28 1935. The aircraft had been developed from the Potez 54 bomber and was constructed as a high-wing monoplane. The wooden fuselage had a composite coating, whereas the wings were covered with fabric and the leading edge was made out of metal. The aircraft was propelled by two Gn√¥me & Rh√¥ne radial engines whose 14 cylinders produced some 870 hp. The engines were mounted in two side cradles, fixed to the fuselage and to the wings. The cabin was divided into two compartments and could accommodate 14 to 16 people. A version equipped with Hispano-Suiza V-engines was ordered by Air France in 1936. These were used on routes inside South America. By late 1936, many Potez 62s were employed on routes to Europe and the Far East, as the aircraft was robust and reliable, albeit slow. It remained in service until the Second World War, and one was used by the Free French Air Force.

Founded in the early sixth century, St Padarn's Church has gone through many changes, from a Welsh monastic centre (a clas), a Benedictine priory, a clas again, a royal rectory, a church controlled by Chester's Vale Royal Abbey, and since 1538 a parish church under a vicar. It is at Llanbadarn Fawr, near Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion, Wales, United Kingdom. History Although its origins are obscure, the site of the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, probably by Saint Padarn,E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979). after whom it was named.Llanbadarn Fawr means \\"great church of Padarn\\"; cf. Llanbadarn Fawr, Powys; http://www.cpat.org.uk/ycom/radnor/llanbadarnfawr.pdf. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due to the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence.Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 99. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.The standard history, E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), remains useful though it is now outdated. Origins of the foundation in the sixth century Orthodox icon. It is likely that St Padarn, if indeed a bishop, would have worn chasuble, stole and girdle, over the alb (the long white coat), a cappa (long black cloak) or (coloured) cope, a crown-like mitre and a pallium. There is a good chance he carried a crozier, and may also have worn a pectoral cross, around his neck. Whilst the exact date Saint Padarn founded the church is uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church may have been the seat of an abbot or bishop during the years immediately following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishopD. P.

(as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as we understand the term today, but closer to a collegiate churchChurch buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the fourth century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the twelfth century. Also, as Pearson observed \\"Before the eleventh century Welsh dioceses in the fixed territorial sense were not the norm: a major centre of ecclesiastical power, the clas church or monasterium, exerted influence through daughter-houses, and the area of this influence waxed and waned with the power that the local ruler could exert over his neighbours. The term clas, plural clasau, probably derived from classis, meaning a gathering or group of people, a corpus or collegium. Perhaps of monastic origin, such churches were headed by either a bishop or an abbot, and were usually regarded as mother-churches, although the term could be applied to smaller ecclesiastical institutions. Claswyr, or those clerics who normally lived within the church, were usually styled canons; however, this title is a post-Norman usage which reflects the conditions of that period.\\" See \\"Introduction: The Welsh cathedrals 1066‚Äì1300\\", in M.J.

Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 18. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre. Saint Padarn Very little is known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing with any degree of certainty; the earliest literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097.E. G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, 1979), p. 26. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little that we do have. Following the general custom of Europe in the late classical and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women.Generally, see Elissa R. Henken, Traditions of the Welsh Saints (D.S. Brewer, 1987); Elissa R. Henken, The Welsh Saints: A Study in Patterned Lives (Boydell & Brewer, Woodbridge, 1991). But the date and circumstances of the foundation of the church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090.A. W. Wade-Evans, Life of St. David (SPCK, London, 1923). That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today.Hagiographic works, particularly those of the Middle Ages, can often incorporate a valuable record of institutional and local history, and evidence of popular cults, customs, and traditions. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint's status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.See Thomas J. Heffernan, Sacred Biography: Saints and Their Biographers in the Middle Ages (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992). Traditionally Padarn was said to come originally from Brittany, but he may have come from south-east Wales.Butler believes that he was probably born and educated in south-east Wales; Peter Bartrum, Early Welsh Genealogical Tracts (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1966), reprints ByS 21, which recounts the tradition that Padarn was, like David, descended from Ceredig ap Cunedda, in Padarn's case through his mother Gwen ferch Ceredig ap Cunedda. This is certainly possible, and would have helped him secure a strong base from which to evangelise Ceredigion. See also Alban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102. He was said to be both abbot and bishop (the distinction was not so great then as it later becameDioceses were fluid at this time in Wales, and equally, a bishop did not necessarily have the territorial attributes the ecclesiastical rank was later to obtain. Bishops were, as Lewis described them, \\"a kind of missionary bishop\\"; Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 16; Sir John Edward Lloyd, History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest (Longmans, Green & Co, London, 1912), vol I, p. 208.) for many years, and from his base at what is now known as Llanbadarn Fawr (great or high church of St Padarn) he evangelised the neighbouring countryside.Traditionally with the help of the eight hundred and forty-seven monks (doubtless a grossly exaggerated number) he was said to have brought with himthe accounts suggest that he founded a community 120 strong at Llanbadarn Fawr; this figure is almost certainly a gross exaggeration; as noted above, Bowen suggest that there might have a dozen monks; E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 18. St Padarn, by Tom Equels, awaiting mounting in a tomb recess in the Lady Chapel, north transept Little more can be said of Padarn, though he later attracted the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed details of his life.Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae ed. A. W. Wade-Evans (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1944). He may have been more closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints,Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 225. The Anglo-Saxons gained control of what we now refer to as eastern England in the fifth century. In the mid-sixth century they started expanding into the Midlands, then in the seventh century they expanded again into the south-west and the north of England. The unconquered parts of southern Britain, notably what we now call Wales, retained their Romano-British culture, in particular preserving Christianity. If St Padarn were from south east Wales it is more probable that he would have represented a sub-Roman survival. For the Roman period in Ceredigion generally, see J. L. Davies, \\"The Roman Period\\" in J. L. Davies and D. P. Kirby (eds), Cardiganshire County History (Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, 1994), vol I, pp. 276‚Äì317. as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads.His seven known dedications are beside two Roman roads that run north and south linking forts on either side of the Cambrian mountains. This implies, according to Rees, that Padarn's followers worked around the ruined Roman garrisons; Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 225. According to Evans, \\"On the west side of the mountains Llanbadarn Fawr, Llanbadarn Fach [Llanbadarn Trefeglwys], Llanbadarn Odwyn and Pencarreg [now dedicated to St Patrick] church are situated near to the Roman road running north from Carmarthen to Llanio, which then follows the ancient Sarn Helen route across the Ystwyth river to the Roman fort at Pennal in Meirionethshire. On the eastern side of the mountains (another) Llanbadarn [possibly he means St Padarn's Church, Cross Gates, Llandrindod Wells], Llanbadarn Fynydd and Llanbadarn Garreg follow the Roman road from Y Gaer at Brecon to the Roman fort at Castell Collen\\"; Neil Evans, \\"The Golden Age of the Welsh Saints: St Padarn\\" (http://www.parishofaberystwyth.org.uk/history.html). There is also a church dedicated to St Padarn in Gwynedd (Llanberis), although the village where it is sited is named after St Peris. This is however new, having been built on virgin ground in 1884‚Äì5 by Arthur Baker; E. Beazley and P. Howell, The Companion Guide to North Wales (HarperCollins, London, 1975), p. 150; The Builder, 7 February 1885, pp. 198, 201 & 15 August 1885, p. 220. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn HelenVariously said to be named after Saint Elen of Caernarfon, a Celtic saint, whose story is told in The Dream of Macsen Wledig part of the Welsh Mabinogion. She is said to have ordered the construction of roads in Wales during the late fourth century, and traditionally, she is said to have been a daughter of the Romano-British ruler Eudaf Hen (Octavius) and the wife of Macsen (Magnus Clemens Maximus), the fourth-century emperor in Britain, Gaul, and Spain who was killed in battle in 388; Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 105.) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi BrefiAt the Synod of Brefi, 550/560, St David refuted the teaching of St Cadoc, (reputedly guilty of reviving the Pelagian heresies concerning original sin and free will), his victory aided by the miraculous uprising of the mound on which the church is built; which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion. A section of the Roman road, Sarn Helen, in Ceredigion According to tradition, Padarn continued to preside over his see for twenty-one years,According to the Latin hexameters of Johannes Sulgenus, son of Sulgen. during which time he was said to have erected a number of churches and founded several monasteries in the province or lordship of Ceredigion,According to John of Tynemouth; V. H. Galbraith, \\"The Historia Aurea of John, Vicar of Tynemouth and the Sources of the St Albans Chronicle (1327‚Äì1377)\\", in H. W. C. Davis (ed), Essays in History Presented to Reginald Lane Poole (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1927), pp. 379‚Äì95. later Cardiganshire (and in modern times once again known as Ceredigion), where he placed colonies of monks from the principal establishment at Llanbadarn Fawr. His preaching throughout west Wales was attested to in the Welsh Triads.The \\"Welsh Triads\\" (Welsh Trioedd Ynys Prydein, literally Triads of the Island of Britain) are a group of related texts in medieval manuscripts which preserve fragments of Welsh folklore, mythology and traditional history in groups of three. The triad is a rhetorical form whereby objects are grouped together in threes, with a heading indicating the point of likeness; Rachel Bromwich (editor and translator), Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 3rd Edition, 2006). At the end of that period, possibly being recalled to Brittany, where he was made bishop of Vannes (though it is more than likely that this was a distinct individualAlban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.), he was succeeded as abbot of the church at Llanbadarn Fawr and bishop of the proto-diocese, which was subsequently called, after its first bishop, \\"Paternensis,\\" by Cynog. It has been suggested that St Padarn himself may have been buried on Bardsey Island, the legendary \\"Island of 20,000 saints\\".Elissa R. Henken, Traditions of the Welsh Saints (D.S. Brewer, 1987), pp. 121‚Äì127. Generally, on Saint Padarn, see Alban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102; G. H. Doble, St Patern (Series of Cornish Saints, no 43, 1940); Elissa R. Henken, Traditions of the Welsh Saints (D.S. Brewer, 1987), pp. 121‚Äì127. But as with any detail of his life, we cannot be certain. Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae is, with Saint Patrick's somewhat earlier Confessio, almost the only contemporary source for this period. Statue of St David at St David's Cathedral Window of St Teilo in Holy Trinity Church, Abergavenny Padarn's Life The anonymous author tells us that Padarn's parents were nobly born Armoricans (Bretons), and that he sailed to Britain with 847 monks to settle and build a monastery. He established monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a miracle, and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach.Maelgwn is portrayed as a tyrant and opponent of the Church, not only in the Life of St Padarn but also in that of Saint Kentigern and of Saint Cadoc. Maelgwn, \\"the great tempter of the saints\\" arriving at the river Clarach, falsely accuses Padarn of theft and is thereby struck blind but restored at Padarn's intercession, after granting Padarn all the land from the river Rheidol to its source. Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and Saint Teilo in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in which the three are honoured by the Patriarch.Unfortunately, church records are almost as poor for this period in the Holy Land as they are in Wales. The Patriarchate traces its line of succession to the first Christian bishops of Jerusalem, the first being James the Just in the first century AD. Jerusalem was granted autocephaly in 451 by the Council of Chalcedon and in 531 became one of the initial five patriarchates. Padarn was given a tunicIt is possible that this tunic was a chasuble, which was adopted by the clergy in the sixth century, though it is said that Jesus himself wore one at the last supper, and its use was limited to the eucharist in the eleventh century. This is plausible, as it developed from the casula, which was derived from the planeta or paenula, a cloak worn by all classes and both sexes in the Graeco-Roman world. The paenula, a cloak similar to the poncho, was an over-dress originally worn only by slaves, soldiers, and others of low degree. Because of its convenience, it was adopted by fashion in the third century as a travelling cloak. ‚Äì which later featured in the best known legend associated with him ‚Äì and a staff. Most likely this account is fabricated, as are much of the details of the lives of the early saints, from a variety of sources, real and imagined. In the most celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg forgiveness before he is released. This seems to borrow the story of a different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain).These are a series of items in late mediaeval Welsh tradition. Lists of the items appear in texts dating to the fifteenth and sixth centuries. Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain, ed. and tr. Rachel Bromwich (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, revised ed. 1991). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.Arthur is scarcely better recorded than Padarn. Principal sources include the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. There follow confusing episodes involving Brittany (sometimes called Letia). Padarn finally leaves for France,At this time France (under the Merovingians) was smaller than it is today. where he dies, but his remains are brought back and buried in Vannes. A final chapter tells how Padarn, David and Teilo divide south Wales into three episcopates, with Padarn as bishop of Ceredigion. Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between the rivers Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in the twelfth century were between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor tributary of the River Ystwyth. The obscure figure of Eithyr is commemorated in the farm name of Llaneithr, which stands a mile east of Devil's Bridge near the river Mynach.This section owes much to Gerald Morgan; Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005). The Life is difficult to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn believed to have been Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century. We must live with our virtually complete ignorance of Padarn's life. It is fair to say, however, that if he had died at Llanbadarn there would have been a shrine, traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn GarregNow Llanbadarn-y-Garreg. St Padarn's Church is a simple single-cell church built in the thirteenth-fourth century. The dedication and location adjacent to the river favour an early medieval origin for Llanbadarn church. There are however few mediaeval records, perhaps because it was a chapelry attached to the church at Cregrina.), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn,It formerly constituted a prebend in the collegiate church of Llanddewi Brefi, founded by Thomas Bek, Bishop of St David's, in 1187. Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [also known as Llanbadarn Fach]This also formerly constituted one of the prebends in the collegiate church of Llanddewi Brefi. The former collegiate church at Llanddewi Brefi is fourteenth and nineteenth century. A Celtic monastery was replaced in 1287 by a college of secular canons. Of the medieval church the fourteenth century crossing tower survives and part of the chancel; Glanmor Williams, \\"The Collegiate Church of Llanddewibrefi\\" (1963) 4 Ceredigion: Journal of the Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 336-52.), if he didn't establish them himself.Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003) The see of Llanbadarn Like so much else, this is hard to say, but the balance of historians' judgements is that there may well have been bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church organisation in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wye was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain.Sir John Edward Lloyd, The Story of Ceredigion 400‚Äì1277 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937). Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church at the time of his visit in 1188.For the Ceredigion background see D. P. Kirby, Padraig O Riain, Heather James and W. Gwyn Thomas, ‚ÄòThe Church in Ceredigion in the Early Middle Ages‚Äô in J.L. Davies and D.P. Kirby (eds), The Cardiganshire County History: Volume 1 (Cardiff, 1994), pp. 365‚Äì420. The flourishing of Llanbadarn Fawr The see, if such it may be called, appears to have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into existence in the years after Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source.The record of bishops everywhere prior to the tenth century is fragmentary. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops ‚Äì Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present ‚Äì to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion,Sir John Edward Lloyd, The Story of Ceredigion 400‚Äì1277 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), p 48. possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol.Lloyd accepts this, and the influence of Padarn in this area, to the almost complete exclusion of St David, is significant, even if we discount the story in the Life of Padarn, that Maelgwn Gwynedd, King of Gwynedd agreed to grant St Padarn, lands \\"from the mouth of the river Rheidol upwards until it touches at its head the limit of the river Clarach, and along the length of the same river as far as the sea is the limit prolonged\\"; A. W. Wade-Evans and Scott Lloyd (ed), Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et genelogiae: Classic Texts in Medieval Welsh Studies v. 1: The Lives and Genealogies of the Welsh Saints (Studies in Medieval Wales) (Welsh Academic Press, 2nd Revised edition, 2013), pp. 258‚Äì9. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint's foundation as its endowment.Vita Sanctia Paterni: the Life of Saint Padarn eds Charles Thomas and David Howlett (2003) 33 Trivium. Even if much of the history of Saint Padarn and the early years of his church cannot be relied upon as accurate (and there is evidence that it conflates several near-contemporary individualsButler notes that the difficulty with Padarn's history is that we have only one Life, and that a comparatively late one (1120), written at Llanbadarn Fawr. This confusion appears to have occurred due to the use of an earlier account of the Welsh saint, and accounts of the Breton saint who was bishop of Vannes. But it is possible, despite this, that they were indeed one and the same person, given the significant cultural links then surviving between south Wales, Brittany and south west England; Alban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.), there can be no doubt of his importance as one of the leading evangelists of Wales in the early sixth century, and the ongoing importance of his clas. The clas church remained important after 601, although the \\"Gwentian\\" version of the Brut y Tywysogion (Chronicle of the Princes) records that the diocese of Llanbadarn was ravaged by the Saxons in 720.\\"The unbelieving Saxon broke many of the churches of Llandaff, Menevia and Llanbadarn, and killed Aidan, bishop of Llandaff, and many of the learned men of his see\\"; W. Pickering, Brut y Tywysogion (1864) 10 Archaeologica Cambrensis p. 7. The less complete Red Book of Hergest (Llyfr coch Hergest) records merely that the year was a hot one; John Williams ab Ithel (ed), Red Book of Hergest (Llyfr coch Hergest) (Rolls Series, London, 1860), p. 5. Rice Rees, An Essay on the Welsh Saints or the primitive Christians, usually considered to have been the founders of churches in Wales (Longmans, London, 1836). It may have been this that led to the loss of its bishop, however this is very uncertain as the entry is probably a much later forgery by Iolo Morganwg.E. G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 22. Traditionally, however, the loss of the episcopal status was as a result of the violent conduct of the inhabitants, who killed their bishop. According to this tradition, having offended a local leader in a feud, Idnertha, who was then bishop of Llanbadarn, was killed, and subsequently buried in Llanddewi Brefi. The date of this event is very unclear. Some sources have Idnertha as the bishop of Llanbadarn at the synod in 603, others have him as being killed by the Saxons 100 years later.http://www.aberystwythguide.org.uk/history/to1100.shtml. Generally, see D.P. Kirby, \\"The Political Development of Ceredigion, c.400‚Äì1081\\" in J.L. Davies and D.P. Kirby (eds), Cardiganshire County History (Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, 1994), vol I, pp. 318‚Äì342. All we can be certain of is that, if there was a bishop of Llanbadarn in 601 ‚Äì and possibly 720 ‚Äì there appears to have been none in later years (though note the later use of the style \\"bishop\\" during Gerald of Wales's visit in 1188). But that did not diminish the power and influence of the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr.Rees suggests that they may have become a reformed Culdee community, although there does not appear to be any evidence to support this hypothesis; Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 105. The only known communities in Wales were at Snowdon and Bardsey Island in north Wales in the days of Gerald of Wales, mentioned (c. 1190) in Speculum Ecclesiae and Itinerarium respectively. By the middle of the ninth century the clas was clearly the wealthiest in the province.E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 21. The renowned Asser, scholar and adviser to Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, may have been educated at Llanbadarn Fawr.Nora Kershaw Chadwick, \\"Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church\\", in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), Studies in the Early British Church (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 121‚Äì82 at p. 124. Asser had been a monk at St David's Cathedral before he was invited to Alfred's court in about 885. He later became Bishop of Sherborne. See Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources (Penguin Classics, New York, 2004); Richard Abels, Alfred the Great: War, Kingship and Culture in Anglo-Saxon England (Longman, New York 2005). If this is correct it would be a strong indication that Llanbadarn's reputation for learning was well-founded. The Later Celtic period and the dominance of Sulien and his family Records become more certain by the tenth century.This is primarily thanks to the scriptoria of monasteries. Violence was endemic in medieval Europe, not excepting Wales. During the tenth and eleventh centuries the coasts of Wales were frequently raided by the Vikings. In 987/988 the clas was destroyed by the Danes, but the worst to suffer was St David's, with attacks in 1073, 1080 and 1091. In 989 Maredudd ab Owain raised a poll tax to bribe the Danes to stay away from Llanbadarn (a tribute was levied of one penny for every man within his dominions, which, in Welsh, was called Glwmaen, or the tribute of the black army).Samuel Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales (S. Lewis & Co, London, 1833). However, in 1038 the church was reduced to ashes by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who wrested it from the hands of prince Hywel ab Edwin, whilst subjugating Ceredigion. The lands were ravaged and the area depopulated, though the clas survived. Gruffydd ap Llywelyn seems to have held the area until his death in 1063.Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was known as King of the Britons. From 1055 until his death in 1063, he was ruler of all Wales ‚Äì an achievement unmatched by any other Welsh prince; \\"Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (1055‚Äì1063)\\" At this period the Llanbadarn community was dominated by Sulien (1011‚Äì91) and his remarkable family. Around 1055 Sulien, who was born into a family educated for many generations in the clas monastic school or college of Llanbadarn Fawr, returned there after five years study in Scotland and ten years study in Ireland (according to his son and biographer). After this time Llanbadarn Fawr became possibly the foremost place of learning in Wales. Sulien went on to be known as Sulien the Wise. He became the abbot of Llanbadarn Fawr and served as Bishop of St David's twice. Under his abbacy Llanbadarn Fawr's monastic library grew in size and importance; reputedly larger than those of Canterbury Cathedral and York Minster.Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook (Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2003), p. 105. Libraries, primarily in monasteries and cathedrals, were at the heart of the growth in knowledge during the Renaissance of the twelfth century; in 1212 the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is \\"one of the chief works of mercy\\"; George Haven Putnam, Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages (Hillary House, New York, 1962). Later Sulien, now Bishop of St David's (he was bishop 1073‚Äì1078 and 1080‚Äì1086), himself took refuge at Llanbadarn Fawr from the Vikings who were raiding St David's.The Vikings were to attack St David's eleven times between 967 and 1091; Mark Redknap, \\"Limits of Viking influence in Wales\\" (December 1998) 40 British Archaeology 12‚Äì14. Many of the bishops were murdered by raiders and marauders, including Bishop Morgeneu I (also known as Morgenveth, Morgeney, Uregeneu) in 999 and Bishop Abraham (who had been newly elected to succeed Sulien) in 1080. In the time of Sulien and his sons and grandsons the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr was an important scriptorium where texts were composed and copied. Rhygyfarch or Rhigyfarch, who was Sulien's eldest son, and may have succeeded him as bishop of St David's (after Sulien's second time in post), wrote, surely at his father's request, his Vita Davidis or Life of St David (later translated into Welsh as Buchedd Dewi) c.1081 ‚Äì c.1090.M. Lapidge, \\"The Welsh-Latin poetry of Sulien's family\\" (1973‚Äì4) 8‚Äì9 Studia Celtica 68‚Äì106. Clearly the book was intended to promote the restoration of the damaged see, especially in the face of the Norman challenge. Rhygyfarch and his brother Ieuan were both fine poets in Latin. Ieuan copied manuscripts and composed poetry (Ieuan also wrote, in Welsh, a verse to Padarn's staff Cyrwen). At the same time, produced in Llanbadarn c.1079, the Ricemarch PsalterThe psalter, now at Trinity College, Dublin as MS 50, includes the Letter of St. Jerome to Chromatius and Elidorus; Breviarius Apostolorum; Martyrologium Hieronymianum, and Various Tables. It shows Viking influence. is one of only two surviving manuscripts certain to have been produced in Wales in the eleventh century.The other is a manuscript of St. Augustine's De Trinitate, now in Cambridge, by the same scribe.

Although the Brut y Tywysogion (The Chronicle of the Princes), a Latin chronicle of events, which survives in Welsh translations, may have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, it may have been kept in Llanbadarn in the eleventh century,For the Brut y Tywysogion generally, see Ian R. Jack, Medieval Wales (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1972). due to Llanbadarn's scriptorium and its reputation as a centre of learning. In the late eleventh century the church in Wales began to come under Norman influence, but Llanbadarn Fawr still essentially belonged to a Welsh world, that of an early Welsh clas, with its hereditary succession to the abbacy and its married clerics. The Church in Wales only gradually came under the influence of the see of Canterbury (and so of Rome) and even more slowly under its control. Wider political events however were to accelerate this.John Reuben Davies, \\"Aspects of Church Reform in Wales, c.1093-c.1223\\", in Anglo-Norman Studies 30, Proceedings of the Battle Conference 2007, edited by C. P. Lewis (Boydell, Woodbridge, 2008), pp. 85‚Äì99. Llanbadarn and the Normans The Normans arrived in Ceredigion in 1073‚Äì1074,Brut y Tywysogion (Chronicles of the Princes) ed T. Jones (University of Press Press, Cardiff, 1955). and from the early twelfth century Norman political and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's.The first, Bernard, appointed by Henry I, was the last bishop to dispute the primacy of the see of Canterbury; David Walker, \\"Bernard (d. 1148)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004). In about the year 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, with the exception of Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc's men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.Even a century later the church was the richest in the diocese, with an annual revenue of 100 marks (¬£66 13 s 4 d) at the time of the Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angliae et Walliae auctoritate P. Nicholai IV (Records Commission, London, 1802), p. 272, in 1291‚Äì1292; \\"Benefice of LLANBADARN FAWR\\" in Taxatio; cf. Sir John Edward Lloyd, (1931) Archaeologia Cambrensis, p. 202. For comparison, the next richest, Llandysul, was worth ¬£20 in 1291‚Äì1292. In 1110, King Henry I took Cardigan from his appointee Owain ap Cadwgan, son of Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, ostensibly as punishment for a number of crimes including that of the rape and abduction of his cousin Nest, wife of Gerald de Windsor and ward of King Henry I.John Davies, A History of Wales (Penguin Group, London, 1993), pp. 112‚Äì13. Nest was the only legitimate daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, last King of Deheubarth. This action incurred the wrath not only of the Normans but of those Welsh who had been victimised by Owain and his followers. In turn Henry gave the Lordship of Cardigan (as the Normans called Ceredigion), including Cardigan Castle, to Gilbert fitz Richard, Earl of Clare,George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, Vol III, Ed. Vicary Gibbs (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London, 1913), p. 243. who imposed a string of castles through the lordship.Gilbert was given an area with one major castle at Cardigan already in use, but with the hinterland little explored. He secured Cardigan and established himself at Aberystwyth (not the later Edwardian stronghold) and commissioned a number of castles, some of which bore or came to bear Welsh names, while others were identified by the name of their Norman Castellans. They included: Walter's Castle, Razo's Castle, Lampeter Castle (also known as Stephen's Castle), Humphrey's Castle (later rebuilt as Castell Hywel), Richard's Castle, Blaenporth (also known as Ralph's Castle); David Walker, Medieval Wales (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990). As potent as the military power of the Normans from the 1070s were the ideas and practices introduced into Wales, particularly in the sphere of ecclesiastical affairs; these were adopted and adapted by the native elites.See \\"Introduction: The Welsh cathedrals 1066‚Äì1300\\", in M.J.

The short-lived Benedictine priory Between 1111 and 1117The letters connected with the grant of Llanbadarn by Gilbert Fitz Richard are to be found in the Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancti Petri Gloucestriae ed. W.H. Hart (HMSO, London, 1863), vol II, pp. 73‚Äì9. Some of these are of doubtful authenticity. There is also a brief statement of the monastery's rights over Llanbadarn included in a long list of donations of other lands and churches, vol I, p. 106: De Sancto Paterno in Wallia. Anno Domini millesimo centesimo undecimo, Gilbertus filius Ricardi, unus de praecipuis Angliae principibus, dedit ecclesiae Sancti Petri Gloucestriae terram et ecclesiam Sancti Paterni in Wallia, et omnia quae ad earn pertinent inter divisiones maris et duarum aquarum, et medietatem magnae piscaturae quam fecit, et decimas omnium rerum de suo dominio appendentium ad castellum suum de Penwediche. This can be roughly translated as \\"Of St Padern in Wales: The year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eleven, Gilbert fitz Richard, one of the most important the nobles of England, gave to the Church of Saint Peter of Gloucester, the lands in Wales belonging to St Padarn's church, between the parts of the sea, and everything belonging to it, and all of the waters of the two, and midst of the great fishing that he wrought, of the weight of a tenth part of all things from his dominion to his castle of Penweddig\\". Penweddig would be the early castle is built near Tanybwlch, south of the Ystwyth, to strengthen the power of King Henry I in the area (Aberystwyth Castle dates from a century later). This note would have us believe that the earl's grant was made in 1111. Sir John Edward Lloyd has argued, History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest (Longmans, Green & Co, London, 1911), vol II, pp. 432‚Äì3 n, the true date is more probably 1116-7. This is explained by Brooke. The gift is dated 1111 in the index, but the charter of Gilbert (who died in or before 1117; George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, Vol III, Ed. Vicary Gibbs (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London, 1913), p. 243) is witnessed by Bishop Bernard, who was consecrated 1115. He suggests that the clas was granted 1111 and confirmed by charter some time between Bernard's accession and Gilbert's death. He does note, however, that Bernard does not appear in what may well be an early version of the grant, incorporated in Henry I's pancarte attributed to 1114; Christopher Brooke, \\"St Peter of Gloucester and St Cadoc of Llancarfan\\", in Matthias McD. Bodkin (ed), Celtic and Saxon (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1914), pp. 258‚Äì322, at 264‚Äì5, 271. the ancient clas church was granted by Gilbert fitz Richard to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester (a Benedictine house),Many of these early clasau were granted as endowments to the monasteries, particularly those of the Augustinians, founded by the Normans and the Welsh Princes. The church at Cardigan was granted to Gloucester Abbey at around the same time; Janet Burton and Karen St√∂ber (eds), Abbeys and Priorities of Medieval Wales (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2015), p. 110; R. Neville Hadcock and David Knowles, Medieval Religious Houses, England and Wales (Harlow, London, 1971), pp. 55, 69; Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancti Petri Gloucestriae ed. W.H. Hart (Rolls Series, London, 1863‚Äì1867), vol. 1, pp. 73‚Äì9, 106. Other clasau became parish churches. as a cell or priory of St Peter's Abbey. This may have meant the construction of a stone church, perhaps the first on the site; a new tower and porch were built.Nora Kershew Chadwick, \\"Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church\\", in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), Studies in the Early British Church (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 162‚Äì4, 177. It is not clear whether the Celtic monks and priests (married and single) were expelled, or whether they were joined by brethren of a new sort.Janet Burton, \\"Transition and Transformation: the Benedictine Houses\\", in Janet Burton and Karen St√∂ber (eds), Monastic Wales: New Approaches (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2013), pp. 21‚Äì3, at p. 21. A few years later, in 1141, Ewenny Priory, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was founded as a priory of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. As with Llanbadarn, there was a pre-existing church, in this case definitely one in stone, and probably dating from the 1120s, as it was consecrated 1126 by Bishop Urban of Llandaff. The monks were in residence for scarcely twenty years. Llanbadarn would have been a simple or obedientiary priory, a dependency of the abbey. The superior of such a priory, who was subject to the abbot in everything, was called a \\"prior.\\" These monasteries were satellites of the mother abbey. In light of earlier activities at Llanbadarn, it is worth noting that the forty-eighth rule of Saint Benedict prescribes extensive and habitual holy reading for the brethren.Esther De Waal, A Life Giving Way: A Commentary on the Rule of St Benedict (A. & C. Black, London, 2006), pp. 140‚Äì5; Nirmal Kaur, History of Education (Mittal Publications, New Delhi, 2005), p. 44. However, Benedictine monks were disallowed worldly possessions, thus necessitating the preservation and collection of sacred texts in monastic libraries for communal use.Francis Wormald and C.E. Wright, The English Library before 1700 (The Athlone Press, London, 1958), p. 15. One of the key Benedictine practices was copying sacred texts, so it might be expected that the monks created a scriptorium, if indeed one hadn't survived from the time of Sulien and his sons and grandsons. Benedictine monastic life at Llanbadarn Fawr was short-lived. First the princes of Gwynedd and then those of Deheubarth expelled the Normans, driving the English monks away when they re-conquered Ceredigion in 1136, after a victory against the Normans at Crug Mawr, following the death of King Henry I in 1135.Gerald of Wales, Itinerarium Cambriae. Lewis notes that the account of the clas being restored in 1136 conflicts with the evidence of the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326. In this, the jury declared that Gloucester had peacefully held the church until 20 May 1212, when the two monks having charge of the church were murdered. Lewis, however, prefers the account of Gerald (which has the clas community alone occupying the church) to that of the later inquisition; Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40 at pp. 17‚Äì18. Little is known of events over the next 45 years. However, it seems likely that the Celtic monks returned to their old clas.For more on the priory, see F.G. Cowley, The monastic order in South Wales, 1066‚Äì1349 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1977); Martin Heale, The Dependent Priories of Medieval English Monasteries (Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge, 2004) Studies in the History of Medieval Religion, 22; Brian Golding, 'Trans-border transactions: patterns of patronage in Anglo-Norman Wales', Haskins Society Journal, 16, ed.

Korngiebel (Woodbridge, 2006), pp. 27‚Äì46; Sir John Edward Lloyd, History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest (Longmans, Green & Co, London, 1911), vol II, pp. 432‚Äì3. The restored clas in transition The church seems to have been restored as a clas or re-founded as a college of secular priests (a collegiate church) before 1144, but the heyday of the clas churches had passed. Gloucester Abbey tried to recover the church in 1175 and again in 1251, and even appealed to the Pope, but without success.Janet Burton and Karen St√∂ber (eds), Abbeys and Priorities of Medieval Wales (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2015), p. 110. The ancient clas establishment seems to have re-emerged from the brief period of the priory, for mention occurs in the Welsh annals, in the year 1137, of the death of John (Ieuan),M'S 199 in the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, contains a fragmentary late eleventh-century copy of the monumental treatise De Trinitate by St Augustine of Hippo. The National Library of Wales possesses a photographic facsimile of a small part of the manuscript (NLW Facsimile 196). CCCC 199 is the work of the scribal artist Ieuan ap Sulien, who both copied the text of Augustine's treatise and vigorously decorated it with over 150 coloured initials in a version of Irish zoomorphic interlace style. Francoise Henry stated that Ieuan was \\"the scribe and probably also the painter, of CCCC 199\\" (\\"Remarks on the decoration of three Irish psalters\\" (1960) 61C Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy pp. 23‚Äì40, at p. 39). The close interrelationship between the initials and the text of the manuscript, the stylistic match between the decoration of CCCC 199 and Ieuan's artistic work in the Psalter and Martyrology made for his brother Rhigyfarch, and Ieuan's failure, in his concluding poem in CCCC 199, to mention anyone other than himself as having had a hand in producing the manuscript, establish that the initials are his work. See Timothy Graham, \\"The poetic, scribal, and artistic work of Ieuan ap Sulien in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 199: addenda and assessment\\" (1996) 29(3) National Library of Wales Journal 241‚Äì256. arch-priest or archdeacon of Llanbadarn, who could have been none other than Ieuan ap Sulien, of the great line of Sulien.Nora Kershaw Chadwick, \\"Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church\\", in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), Studies in the Early British Church (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 170. In the twelfth century clas churches were led by an abod with clergy under an \\"archpresbyter\\" (archoffeiriad).Morgan emphasises the revived use of the title \\"arch-priest\\"; Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 99. However chantries in religious communities were sometimes headed by a warden or archpriest; D. Crouch, \\"The Origins of the Chantry: Some Further Anglo-Norman Evidence,\\" (2001) 27 Journal of Medieval History 159-80. An archpriest might also be senior priest, responsible for a number of parishes. One archpriest still exists in Britain, at Haccombe. This is a small hamlet in Devon. Its small chapel is dedicated to Saint Blaise. The benefice is occupied by an incumbent with the title of Archpriest. The archpresbytery was established in 1341 with six clergy: only the archpriest survived at the Reformation.. The parish is now combined with that of Stoke- in-Teignhead with Combe-in-Teignhead. In the same record, in the year 1146, the death of Sulien ab Rhygyfarch, \\"a man of great knowledge, and one of the college of Llanbadarn\\", is noted. By this time, after the loss of the Gloucester link, the church was again in the hands of a lay abbot; the use of the title abbot did not mean that the church was an abbey. But despite the continuity ‚Äì or perhaps because of it ‚Äì all was apparently not well. In 1188 Gerald of Wales accompanied Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, on a tour of Wales, the primary object being a recruitment campaign for the Third Crusade, a secondary one to establish his authority over the whole Welsh church. Gerald's vivid account of the journey is the first great European travel book. Gerald visited Llanbadarn Fawr,Accompanied by the abbots of Whitland and Strata Florida; Jemma Bezant, \\"Travel and communication\\" in Janet Burton and Karen St√∂ber (eds), Monastic Wales: New Approaches (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2013), pp. 133‚Äì146, at p. 134. and described the college of secular canons under a lay abbot (Ednowain \\"bishop of Llanbadarn\\"), in not especially flattering terms; it should be remembered that Gerald was a zealous reformer, critical of anything of which he disapproved, as he did of Llanbadarn: the abbot was described as \\"a certain old man, waxen old in iniquity\\". The account of his visit was subsequently published in the Itinerarium Cambriae (1191),Gerald of Wales, The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales trans. Lewis Thorpe (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1978). and was followed by the Descriptio Cambriae in 1194. Gerald tells us further that a Breton knight had come to the church for Mass and found a band of about twenty young men, all armed and equipped according to the local custom. He asked \\"which was the abbot, and they pointed out to him a man with a long spear in his hand, who was walking in front of the others\\". He then tells the story of the murder of a bishop of Llanbadarn, murdered by the predecessors of the present generation of clergy. We cannot be sure how much of this was true. But Gerald disapproved of married clergy (which had been declining generally though only finally abolished by Rome in the eleventh centuryBy Gregory VII; H.E.J. Cowdrey, The Register of Pope Gregory VII 1073‚Äì1085: An English Translation (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002). and deplored in principle the inheritance of church office. But all he tells us of Llanbadarn is hearsay, apart from the name of the abbot. In any case, no move was made by Archbishop Baldwin in favour of reform: the Lord RhysRhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth, at this time Justiciar of South Wales for King Henry II. was with them, and they would not have wished to offend him. In any event, it would have been a matter for the Bishop of St David's, who was Peter de Leia.Peter de Leia was appointed by King Henry II as bishop, despite the preference of the cathedral chapter for Gerald himself. Besides his rivalry with Gerald, de Leia had a stormy relationship with Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth. After de Leia's death in 1198, the chapter was again refused permission to elect Gerald, and the see remained vacant for six years. There is then no further information about Llanbadarn for nearly sixty years. The decline of the clas or college Strata Florida Abbey, the Cistercian house that was to attract patronage from the princes away from Llanbadarn The Normans briefly returned to power in the 1160s, and before Rhys ap Gruffudd expelled them c.1189 they had begun the foundation of the Cistercian abbey at Strata Florida, carried on by Rhys. The Cistercians enjoyed great prestige in Wales, and Llanbadarn Fawr was eclipsed as a centre of Welsh culture. The monks took over the Chronicle of the Princes and began the copying of major Welsh manuscripts.D.H. Williams, \\"The White Monks in Powys II: Strata Florida\\" (1976) 11 Cistercian Studies 155‚Äì191. Angle of north transept and nave west wall Welsh rule was briefly interrupted in 1211 when royal forces again seized Aberystwyth, but control was soon regained by the Welsh under the aegis of Llywelyn the Great, and so it remained until Welsh power collapsed in 1246. Between 1231 and 1247 the church was divided between Gloucester Abbey and St David's Cathedral, with the requirement of the provision of a vicarage (that is, a living for a vicar),St Davids Episcopal Acta 1085‚Äì1280 ed Julia Barrow (South Wales Record Society, Cardiff, 1998), pp. 116‚Äì17. but it had passed to the Crown by 1251.Calendar of Patent Rolls 1247‚Äì1258 (HMSO, London, 1908), p. 88: \\"Presentation of Peter de Abusun, King's kinsman, to the church of Lampadarmaur, void by the confirmation of the election of Master L. de Sancto Martino to the church of Rochester; directed to the bishop of St Davids\\" (28 February, Westminster). If there was a vicarage at the time of the taxatio, it was perhaps the individual rector who presented to it.\\"Benefice of LLANBADARN FAWR\\" in Taxatio. King Henry III appropriated the advowson of the church, when he seized the lands of Maelgwn ap Maelgwn, called Maelgwn Fychan, the son of Maelgwn ap Rhys, possibly to help pay the construction costs of the new church, though the seizure was contrary to the Gloucester Abbey claims and Gilbert fitz Richard's charters.Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 17; Sir John Edward Lloyd, The Story of Ceredigion 400‚Äì1277 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), pp. 34‚Äì35. In 1242 the king had explicitly said that the church belonged to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, and granted royal protection without term in a mandate addressed to Maredudd ab Owain, Maelgwn ap Maelgwn, Rhys ap Rhys, and all bailiffs and ministers of south Wales; Calendar of Close Rolls, 1242‚Äì1247, p. 279; Sir John Edward Lloyd, The Story of Ceredigion 400‚Äì1277 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), pp. 87‚Äì91; Sir John Edward Lloyd, History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest (Longmans, Green & Co, London, 1911), vol II, pp. 637‚Äì8. After the appropriation the king ordered an inquiry (1247) into the alienation of lands from the church; Calendar of Close Rolls, 1242‚Äì1247 ed Sir Henry Maxwell-Lyte (HMSO, London, 1916), vol 5, pp. 545‚Äì6; Henry III's officials controlled Aberystwyth, and it was probably then that the building of the present church began.Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 100. That it was a royal project is suggested by the very size of the building. The advowson ‚Äì or right of presentation ‚Äì was to remain in the hands of the Crown from 1246 to 1360,F.R. Lewis, \\"The Rectors of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, from 1246 to 1360\\" (1937) 92 Archaeologia Cambrensis 233‚Äì246. The church was now under a rector, who replaced the lay abbot;Roughly speaking, the distinction between rector and vicar was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or impropriator, of the living). In this case the rector kept both 1246‚Äì1360; when Vale Royal Abbey appropriated the church in 1359/60 the rector was replaced by a vicar, who received only the lesser tithes ‚Äì and after the Reformation not even those. Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810). Initially it had not been unusual for religious houses in possession of rectories also to assume the capability to collect tithe and glebe income for themselves, but this practice was banned by the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215. Thereafter, over the mediaeval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemption from the Council's decrees, so as to appropriate the income of rectoral benefices to their own use. However, from the thirteenth century onwards, diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and \\"greater tithes\\" of grain, hay and wood could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; the \\"lesser tithes\\" had to remain within the parochial benefice; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of \\"vicar\\"; David Knowles, The Religious Orders in England, Vol II (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1955), p.290. and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts the evidence of the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence.Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40 at pp. 17‚Äì18. However, it is difficult to see how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest). Despite the splendidly sized new building (albeit a plain one), the church declined in status as the college gradually died. It is possible that the community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor do we know whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King Henry III in 1246,Bishop Basil Jones, writing in 1856, stated that \\"The church of Llanbarn-fawr, after the cessation of the episcopate, retained something of a coenobitic or collegiate character to at least the beginning of the thirteenth century, in spite of an attempt at the commencement of the twelfth to appropriate its revenues to the Abbey of Gloucester\\". He noted further, that there was \\"no evidence\\" as to \\"how long the church retained its collegiate constitution, but it must have done so beyond the middle of the thirteenth century, when the present fabric was erected, and may have done so until the appropriation of its revenue to Vale- Royal in 1360\\"; W.B. Jones and E.A. Freeman, The history and antiquities of Saint David's (J.H. & J. Parker, London, 1856), p. 275. although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost.For an example of a collegiate church with a rector in charge, see Lowthorpe Collegiate Church (no. 201) in A History of the County of York (Victoria County Histories, London, 1974), vol 3, pp. 359‚Äì75. This college, which was founded in 1333, had a rector and six perpetual priests (those who were permanently appointed to a cure rather than temporarily attached to a church or chapel), assisted by three clerks, of whom two were to deacons (or one a deacon and the other a sub-deacon). There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels,E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, ¬£1979), pp. 55‚Äì56 (a guild chapel); W. Gwyn Thomas, \\"The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church\\" (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127‚Äì129 (the doors in the chancel being survivors of the entrance to a chantry chapel rather than a rood loft). Crouch points to the parallel development of communities or colleges of secular priests or canons as an influence on the evolution of the chantry. Such communities were not monastic foundations, although members shared a common life. Like the monasteries, they offered dedicated prayers for the dead; D. Crouch, \\"The Origins of the Chantry: Some Further Anglo-Norman Evidence,\\" (2001) 27 Journal of Medieval History 159-80. which could suggest the presence of more than one priest. Surprisingly, perhaps, the tithes were administered locally by a Welshman, Gwilym ap Gwrwared, who was probably grandfather of famed bard Dafydd.Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 78. The church was said to have been rebuilt, after serious fire damage, around 1257‚Äì1265, though whether this was a rebuilding, or a continuation of work commenced after 1246, is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the fire damage was caused when, in 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, with a large army, seized Llanbadarn Fawr from Norman control. Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, son of King Henry III and brother of King Edward I, was Lord of Cardigan from 1265. Given the size of the church it is probable that construction took many years, even if it were not interrupted. If it commenced in 1246 it is quite conceivable that work was not complete until 1265, or later. North transept, western angle to nave, showing apparent foundations of a former structure Nave wall by north transept, north west side, showing base of possible structure The rectors were almost all royal favourites or up-and-coming ecclesiastical leaders, who would have rarely visited the church.Given the size of the parish a single priest would have been insufficient.

He was brother to Thomas Bek, bishop of St David's 1280‚Äì93. Antony Bek became bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem,He was (titular) Latin Patriarch 1306‚Äì1311. Acre had been lost in 1291, and the patriarchate moved to Cyprus then Rome after 1374. but was more noted as a warrior than for his piety.See C.M. Fraser, A History of Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham 1283‚Äì1311 (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1957). Llanbadarn Fawr was the focus of the English forces assembled in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329‚Äì1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence.John Morgan-Guy and William Gibson (eds), Religion and Society in the Diocese of St Davids 1485‚Äì2011 (Ashgate, 2015), p. 93. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p.25; 'Pleas and evidences: Fos.69‚Äì89, fo. 89', in The Ledger Book of Vale Royal Abbey, ed. John Brownbill (Manchester, 1914), pp. 149‚Äì166 http://www.british- history.ac.uk/lancs-ches-record-soc/vol68/pp149-166 [accessed 23 April 2015]. Frankalmoin tenure meant that an ecclesiastical body held land free of military service such as knight service or other secular or religious service, but sometimes in return for the religious service of saying prayers and masses for the soul of the grantor. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries jurisdiction over land held belonged to the ecclesiastical courts, and was thus immune from royal jurisdiction. There is no record of such an ecclesiastical court at Llanbadarn. Frankalmoign(e) was also known as \\"tenure in free alms\\". Gifts to religious institutions in free alms were defined first as gifts to God, then to the patron saint of the religious house, and finally to those religious serving God in the specific house. Frankalmoin was the tenure by which the greater number of the monasteries and religious houses held their lands. It was expressly exempted from the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, by which the other ancient tenures were abolished, and it was the tenure by which the parochial clergy and many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations held their lands through the nineteenth century. As a form of donation, frankalmoin fell into disuse because on any alienation of the land the tenure was converted into socage. An apparent attempt was made to abolish frankalmoin in the Administration of Estates Act 1925; but in any case no fresh grants in frankalmoin, save by the Crown, were possible after Quia Emptores in 1290; Edward H. Burn, John Cartwright and Geoffrey C. Cheshire, Cheshire and Burn's modern law of real property (Oxford University Press, London, 18th edition, 2011), p. 111. From this period we also have the first record of a baptism, of William Knovill, son of John Knovill, King's Bailiff in Aberystwyth, in 1286.Sir John Goronwy Edwards, Calendar of Ancient Correspondence concerning Wales (University Press Board, Cardiff, 1935), p. 93. Doubtless the surviving twelfth century font was used. The later mediaeval period and the end of conventual life The college survived until it disappeared or was dissolved, certainly before 1361‚Äì1362, and probably as early as 1246 or even 1212 (as mentioned above). In 1346 William Kilsby, rector, died,Calendar of Patent Rolls 1358‚Äì1361 (HMSO, London, 1911), p. 18. and King Edward III gave the advowson to his eldest son, the Black Prince. The latter made three presentations. One of these was to Thomas Bradwardine, later briefly Archbishop of Canterbury, who was rector of Llanbadarn Fawr 1347‚Äì1349. The parish continued largely if not wholly a sinecure for its rector, with the work actually done by a resident vicar; in Bradwardine's case he was concurrently prebend and the dean of Lincoln,John de Ufford, Bradwardine's predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury, was also previously Dean of Lincoln; both were carried away by the Black Death, in de Ufford's case, before he was consecrated; E.B. Fryde, D.E. Greenway, S. Porter and I. Roy, Handbook of British Chronology (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 3rd rev.√ó ed., 1996). and chaplain and confessor to the King, and probably never visited Llanbadarn Fawr.Bradwardine preached at the victory Mass after the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346, and died of the plague in 1349, only forty days after being consecrated archbishop; Norman F. Cantor, \\"Death comes to the Archbishop\\", in In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World it Made (Simon & Schuster, New York, 2001), pp. 103‚Äì124. Although there were several competing theories as to the etiology of the Black Death, analysis of DNA from victims in northern and southern Europe published in 2010 and 2011 indicates that the pathogen responsible was the Yersinia pestis bacterium, probably causing several forms of plague; S.

Because the church continued to be rich, most of the rectors were well connected clerics, some, like Bradwardine, with distinguished careers. Others were less august ‚Äì or respectable. One of the rectors, Robert Stretton, who may have succeeded Bradwardine, and was in post by 1353, was nominated Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield in 1359. His appointment was however (unsuccessfully) opposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury on the grounds that Stretton could neither read nor writeF.R. Lewis, \\"The Rectors of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, from 1246 to 1360\\" (1937) 92 Archaeologia Cambrensis 233‚Äì246, 244; C. Pap. Lett. 1342‚Äì1362, p. 498. ‚Äì a charge that may well have been politically motivated and may have been untrue. Wharton included in Anglia Sacra a continuation of the history of Lichfield by William Whitlocke, which describes Stretton as \\"eximius vir\\" ‚Äì an exceptional man ‚Äì and goes on to make probably exaggerated claims for his attainments in jurisprudence. Bradwardine was a formidable scholar; Stretton may have been of a more practical bent ‚Äì he was concurrently Constable of Aberystwyth Castle.Black Prince's Register, III, pp. 378, 492; W.G.D. Fletcher, Dictionary of National Biography, LV pp. 47‚Äì48. Tradition has it that Dafydd ap Gwilym, one of the greatest of Welsh poets, was born at Brogynin, Penrhyncoch (at the time in Llanbadarn Fawr parish, and now part of the grouped benefice), early in the fourteenth century, when the parish covered the whole of northern Ceredigion. Dafydd records a number of local place-names in his poetry. He is also known for his connection with Strata Florida, thanks to the story that he was buried there, and to the copying of his poetry into Strata Florida manuscripts.Helen Fulton, Dafydd ap Gwilym and the European context (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1989). In 1359 the Black Prince gave the advowson to four patrons (or feofees), who, on 7 November 1360 appropriated the church to the Cistercian Vale Royal Abbey,A.P. Baggs, Ann J. Kettle, S.J. Lander, A.T. Thacker and David Wardle, \\"Houses of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Vale Royal\\", in C.R. Elrington and B.E.

The appropriation was confirmed 28 November 1360 by Thomas Fastolf, Bishop of St David's (a canon lawyer).Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 26. The ancient church, with its dependent chapels of Castell Gwallter, Llanilar and Llanfihangel y Creuddyn, again became subordinate to another religious house.Calendar of Patent Rolls 1358‚Äì1361 (HMSO, London, 1911), p. 296. Thereafter the abbot and convent of Vale Royal became the corporate rector until 1538, with Llanbadarn Fawr left in the hands of a vicar. The timing could not have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the unfinished nave of their abbey church collapsed,This was ironic when one considers the origins of the abbey. In 1263 Prince Edward, the future Edward I, prior to his accession to the throne, was undertaking a sea voyage from France when his ship was caught in a terrible storm. He then made a vow that if he came safe to land he would found an abbey of unprecedented size and grandeur as a thanksgiving to God for saving him; G.D. Holland, J.N. Hickson, R. Hurst Vose. J.E. Challinor, Vale Royal Abbey and House (Winsford Local History Society, 1977). and rebuilding could not have been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full.A. P. Baggs, Ann J. Kettle, S J. Lander, A. T. Thacker and David Wardle, \\"Houses of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Vale Royal\\", in C.R. Elrington and B.E. Harris (eds), A History of the County of Chester: Volume 3 (Victoria County History, London, 1980). It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already ‚Äì and remained ‚Äì in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that.Vale Royal was often notorious for its misgovernment. The General Chapter, the international governing body of the Cistercian order, in 1455, ordered senior abbots to investigate the abbey, which they described as \\"damnable and sinister\\"; G.D. Holland, J.N. Hickson, R. Hurst Vose and J. E. Challinor, Vale Royal Abbey and House (Winsford Local History Society, 1977); F. A. Latham (ed.), Vale Royal (The Local History Group, Whitchurch, 1993); David Robinson, Janet Burton, Nicola Coldstream, Glyn Coppack Richard Fawcett, The Cistercian Abbeys of Britain (Batsford, London, 1998). As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish. The change in control was not without dispute, however, with both Vale Royal Abbey and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester claiming the valuable church advowson. Legal action dragged on for some years, before Vale Royal Abbey ultimately prevailed.In 1363 Vale Royal Abbey appealed to Pope Urban V to \\"solicit the ratification, confirmation and corroboration of the union, annexation and appropriation of the parish church of Lampadern in the diocese of St. David's, canonically united and appropriated to us and our monastery by the diocesan of the place\\" 'Pleas and evidences: Fos.69‚Äì89, fo. 75', in The Ledger Book of Vale Royal Abbey, ed. John Brownbill (Manchester Record Society, Manchester, 1914), pp. 149‚Äì166 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lancs-ches-record-soc/vol68/pp149-166 [accessed 23 April 2015]; \\"Abbot of Vale Royal to the King and Council in Parliament, seeking a remedy against the Abbot of Gloucester over the advowson of Llanbadarn Fawr, 1388\\" (National Archives, SC 8/27/1349); \\"Petition of the Abbot of the Church of St Peter of Gloucester to the King and Council in present Parliament, 1388\\" (National Archives, SC 8/113/5633) ‚Äì the latter referring to the advowson of the church of St Peterne in Llanbadarn Fawr. Control was also challenged by the Crown itself in 1398, and by Strata Florida Abbey in 1435. Vale Royal found keeping the appropriated church difficult, with the locals being at times difficult (for reasons that were not hard to discover).Calendar of Close Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399 (HMSO, London, 1927), pp. 273‚Äì4, 412; Calendar of Close Rolls, 1429‚Äì1435 (HMSO, London, 1933), p. 364; Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399 (HMSO, London, 1927), pp. 355, 513; Rotulae Parliamentariae v. 43; P.R.O., SC 8/145/7218. The extension of the chancel under Vale Royal Abbey Even though it was subordinate to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, with the construction of a large new sanctuary. There was also a Rood screen and loft, with a carved image of Christ crucified, with the figures of Mary and St John either side, though this is now gone, although the steps to the loft may still be seen to the north side of the chancel. Monuments in chancel, and entrance to roof loft, Llanbadarn Fawr church Whenever it occurred, the long succession of monks and priests living a corporate (not necessarily monastic) life in the clas, priory and finally college of priests was finally at an end, after many hundreds of years. However, as Chadwick has observed: \\"clerics of Llanbadarn seem to have retained their vitality and intellectual activity down to the fifteenth century\\". In 1508 a visitation of Vale Royal Abbey by the Abbot of Dore referred to the church and lordship of Llanbadarn Fawr,\\"State of the monastery of Vale Royal (Cheshire) at the visitation by the Abbot of Dore (Herefordshire), 16 March 1508/9\\" (National Archives, E 135/3/16). Dore was the mother house of Vale Royal. The term \\"Lordship\\" is probably to be taken to refer to the manor of Llanbadarn Fawr, later held by both the Pryses of Gogerddan and the Powells of Nanteos. By the early nineteenth century the name of the manor had been corrupted from Llanbadarn Fawr to Y Vaenor. There are other manors in the parish, including a small manor of Rhydonnen, and Crown manors such as Creuddyn; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810). so the church remained important in the early sixteenth century.The visitation recorded an annual income of ¬£133 6 s 8 d; The Ledger Book of Vale Royal Abbey ed. John Brownbill (Manchester Record Society, Manchester, 1914), pp. 191‚Äì192. Monuments in the chancel, and entrance to stair leading to the rood loft and the door leading to the vestries, Llanbadarn Fawr Church After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and the closure of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church rather than as a religious community. The church remained important in part because the parish was one of the largest in Wales (over 240 square miles).\\"Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr\\" in British Listed Buildings. However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.W.B. Jones and E.A. Freeman, The history and antiquities of Saint David's (J.H. & J. Parker, London, 1856), p. 275. The Dissolution of the monasteries and the loss of church assets With Henry VIII‚Äôs closure of the monasteries 1536‚Äì41, the advowson and tithes of Llanbadarn Fawr became the property of the lay owners. Under the later Stuarts the lordship of Llanbadarn had passed to the Earl of Danby,BM Harleian MS 1220 f. 121v; Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 34. and the rectory to Sir Robert Holmes.BM Harleian MS 1220 f. 124v; Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 34. By 1660 the tithes belonged to Roger Palmer (1634‚Äì1705), who became earl of Castlemaine by virtue (if that is the word) of his wife Barbara (n√©e Villiers) being the mistress of Charles II. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbara's five children by Charles (and perhaps other lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes.This section owes much to Gerald Morgan; Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005). See Sir Alexander Bruce Palmer Chichester, Bart., History of the Family of Chichester from AD 1086 to 1870 (printed for the author, J.C. Hotten, 1871). Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court, was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church.In the time of King James I, in \\"Sir Richard Price, Knt. v. The Freeholders and tenants of the Lordship of Llanbadarn Fawr\\", National Archives, Dispositions taken by Commission, Records of the King's Remembrancer, E 134/Jas1/Misc4, we read of the custom of suit and grist and the ancient mills of the Lordship, as well as to the rectory of Llanfihangel Gwalter and the chapel of Llangynfelyn. On 21 June 1603 the manor of Llanbadarn was granted to Sir Thomas Jones and his sons Henry and Thomas. Afterwards it changed hands many times; Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 34; Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1603‚Äì1610 (HMSO, London, 1857), p. 15. The tithes were not especially valuable; in the eighteenth century the vicarage was worth only ¬£27 annually;Frank Lewis, \\"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15‚Äì40, at p. 34. in the fourteenth century they were comparatively small compared with the income from the lands then owned by the church ‚Äì which passed with the manor or lordship,See, for instance, the indenture of 4 December 1635, which assigned the residue of a 99 year lease in the \\"manor or lordship\\", late in tenure of Sir Thomas Jones, Sir Henry Jones and Thomas Jones, and \\"late parcel of the monastery of Vale Royal\\", with reservation of all forests and royal mines, to Lewis Evans and David Evans; Francis Green (ed), Calendar of Deeds and Documents: vol 1 The Coleman Papers (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1921), D.D.110, p. 26.

In 1657 Sir Richard Pryse leased out the manor; Francis Green (ed), Calendar of Deeds and Documents: vol 1 The Coleman Papers (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1921), D.D.117, pp. 28‚Äì9. The Pryses appear to have acquired an interest in the manor by 1640, as in that year Richard Pryse and Lewis Evans (the same to whom was assigned the manor in 1635), by deed poll, released the equity of redemption in a mortgage on the manor; Calendar of Deeds and Documents, D.D.111, p. 26. By 1810 the manor belonged to the Duke of Leeds, and by 1895 the Powells of Nantoes; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810); Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire & South Wales, 1895 (1895). By the nineteenth century the lands of the manor were held by socage; Mrs Margaret Powell, the last of the Powells of Nanteos, who died in 1952, had continued to hold courts leet at Nanteos until her death. The Llanbadarn tithes were not easy to collect: both the fishermen and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments they had to make in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were not easy to collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and to take advantage of the now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.\\"Katherine, widow of Giles Chichester\\"; the tablet on the east wall of the chancel was erected 1739.

Later life as a parish church Even after the Celtic clas, the Norman priory and (possible) later college of priests had ceased to occupy the site, it remained an important educational and cultural centre.As Chadwick has observed: \\"clerics of Llanbadarn seem to have retained their vitality and intellectual activity down to the fifteenth century\\"; Nora Kershaw Chadwick, \\"Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church\\", in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), Studies in the Early British Church (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 162‚Äì4, 177. William Morgan, later Bishop of Llandaff and of St Asaph, the first translator of the Bible from Greek and Hebrew into Welsh in 1588,The Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue 1563 (5 Eliz. c. 28), ordered the translation of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh by 1567. The translation was done by Morgan while he was vicar of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. was vicarHe may have been curate rather than vicar, although this is unclear. of Llanbadarn Fawr 1572‚Äì1575. The huge extent of the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship impossible for distant inhabitants, so early centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr would act as chapels of ease, and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as Llanfihangel-y- Creuddyn) or Norman lords (e.g. Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes. Churches like Llanbadarn with a large hinterland of lesser churches are often known as mam-eglwysi, mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to the coming of the Normans.The eighth Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus (c. 602‚Äì690) applied the ecclesiastical term parish to the Anglo-Saxon township format where already in existence. Extended since the 973‚Äì975 reign of Edgar (c. 943‚Äì975) the process of parish organisation appears to have been completed in England during the fifty-year reign of Edward III (1312‚Äì1377), when it was also extended to those parts of Wales where it was not yet in operation. For general background see David Petts, The Early Medieval Church in Wales (Stroud, 2009), pp. 157‚Äì97. In later years, because it was impossible for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen,All Saints was built from local stone, probably quarried nearby. The church was designed by the important architect, Henry Jones Underwood, and later had a tower and porch added to a design by William Butterfield, the main architect of the Oxford Movement. It has colourful stained glass, a lectern believed to be carved from a single piece of walnut and a set of candelabra said to be presented by the Blessed John Henry Cardinal Newman, a leader of the Tractarian Movement. which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches. During this time the church at Llanbadarn Fawr gradually declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, and more and more chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated to such an extent that serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497. By the turn of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was relatively plainly decorated ‚Äì see below ‚Äì and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.J.T.

The parish was previously a single parish benefice (under a vicar), but from 2012 it has been in the Benefice of Llanbadarn Fawr and Elerch and Penrhyncoch and Capel Bangor,The formation of the Grouped Benefice was approved by a resolution of the Standing Committee of the Diocesan Conference at its meeting on 13 December 2012 and the Bishop's Decree was sealed by him on 20 December 2012. In practice it did not come into effect until the licensing of the new Priest in Charge, in May 2014. in the deanery of Llanbadarn Fawr, in the archdeaconry of Cardigan, of the Diocese of St David's.St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth. The parish, most recently of a central church persuasion, and with a strong choral tradition, generally has separate Welsh and English language services. The Vicar (formally priest-in-charge) is currently the Reverend Andrew Loat, appointed in 2014, after an interregnum from 2008, following the retirement of the Reverend Timothy Morgan (2001‚Äì2008), the previous vicar. The Venerable Hywel Jones (vicar 1979‚Äì1992) had been cleric with pastoral care 2008‚Äì2014.http://www.stpadarns-llanbadarn.org.uk/. The church is now part of \\"Peaceful Places\\",http://www.peaceful- places.com/destination/llanbadarn-fawr. a heritage tourism trail, which tells the stories of a collection of churches and chapels across North Ceredigion. Organ The church contains a two manual and pedal, 14-stop pipe organ dating from 1885 by Forster and Andrews. A specification can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Architecture There are no traces of the fabric of the original clas church. Most buildings in the sixth century were of wood, wattle and daub. Even churches were wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). Churches were also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. They tended to be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often oratories, rather than full churches.Sir Banister Fletcher, A History of Architecture on the comparative method (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1931), p. 253. Even though the early church settlement at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, it is unlikely that significant building work was done. The clas church would continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia at the beginning of the seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.This signifies a building that has similarities to the basilica structures of Ancient Rome, being of longitudinal rather than central plan, having a central nave with an aisle on either side separated by a colonnade, and an apse at one end. The building at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038.\\"Meeting at Gogerddan\\" (1911) 1(1) Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 23‚Äì30, at p. 24. Portions of an earlier structure were alleged to be included in the present edifice,Black's Picturesque Guide to Wales: North and South and Monmouth-shire (Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh; Catherall and Pritchard, Chester, 1869), p. 233. which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later,Pritchard has argued for an upsurge of stone church construction in Wales in the ninth and tenth centuries, starting on prestigious sites, in response to ecclesiastical reorganization and extensive contact with the Anglo-Saxons; Aimee Pritchard, \\"The Origins of Ecclesiastical Stone Architecture in Wales\\", in Nancy Edwards (ed), The Archaeology of Early Medieval Celtic Churches, Proceedings of a Conference on The Archaeology of the Early Medieval Celtic Churches, September 2004 (Society for Medieval Archaeology Monograph/Maney Publishing, Leeds, 2009). and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115. Much evidence which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005). The present structure has many traces of great antiquity, being large and built in the form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is in the form of an aisleless cruciformThe only other cruciform church in Ceredigion was Strata Florida Abbey; Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 78. Very little now survives of the abbey, except a section of wall and the west door; T. Jones Pierce, \\"Strata Florida Abbey\\" (1950) 1 Ceredigion 18‚Äì33; David M. Robinson and Colin Platt, Strata Florida Talley Abbey (Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments, Cardiff, rev. ed. 1998); D.H. Williams, \\"The White Monks in Powys II: Strata Florida\\" (1976) 11 Cistercian Studies 155‚Äì191. church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.Much of the following section relies on \\"Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr\\" in British Listed Buildings and Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497. The exterior Externally, there are slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have patterned bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, except on the nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, on the north side of the chancel, is less certain.When identifiable sacristies began to appear as identifiable spaces in parish churches by the later thirteenth century they were commonly small rectangular adjuncts on the north side of the chancel, which matches the vestry at St Padarn's; Warwick Rodwell, The Archaeology of Churches (Amberley, Stroud, 2013), p. 46. Externally, the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884. The tower has numerous put-log holes, and is supported on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell- lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with the oldest of the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry.The Rudhall family‚Äôs bell foundry in Gloucester was established in the later 17th century by Abraham Rudhall. His first known bells were a ring of five supplied to St. Nicholas‚Äôs church in Oddington in 1684 and one of them still remains in the church‚Äôs tower and is rung regularly; Mary Bliss, \\"The Last Years of John Rudhall, Bellfounder of Gloucester, 1828‚Äì35\\" (2003) 121 Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society 11‚Äì22, at 11. Bell founding has been a Gloucester industry for at least seven hundred years. The earliest reference is to a burgess called 'Hugh the Bellfounder' in about 1270. One of the leading foundries was run by the Gloucester family of Rudhall who, between 1684 and 1835 produced over 5000 bells in the city, which were dispatched all over the UK and abroad. The oldest peal of bells in the USA, at Christ Church Boston, was cast by Rudhall's of Gloucester in 1774. The oldest bell in St Padarn's was probably cast by Abel Abraham, grandson of the founder of the firm. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859. The church is some 163 feet long. A photograph emphasising the massive tower and transepts The chancel The interior consists of chancel, nave, transepts and south porch, and is formed of rough materials, now largely plastered and whitewashed. The large chancel was restored around 1475, primarily it would appear by extending it and adding new red sandstone Perpendicular segmental-pointed side windows, one three-light and one single- light to the south and one three-light to the north ‚Äì all now with nineteenth century tracery and stained glass. The window is Gothic equilateral. South transept, east side, showing join to crossing and chancel An inscription in the left side window jamb of the east window in the south wall of the chancel may be a contemporary memorial to William Stratford;The jam-stones, four- centred heads and cills are believed to be original, with the mullions and heads of the lights being renewed in 1882‚Äì84; W. Gwyn Thomas, \\"The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church\\" (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127‚Äì129, at 129. it is the word \\"Stratford\\", with a coat of arms with a rebus of the letter \\"W\\" and an abbot's crozier set behind the \\"W\\", with two four-leaved flowers either side.W. J. Hemp in (1931) 86(2) Archeaologia Cambrensis 403‚Äì404. Below this window, now partly obscured by a credence table, is a mediaeval piscina. Another inscription, possibly late fifteenth century, is in the right window jamb of the easternmost north wall window. This is to Thomas ap Dafydd, proctor,Proctors practised in the civil law-dominated admiralty and ecclesiastical courts, the equivalent of attorneys elsewhere. Like the attorneys, they were domini litis rather than merely spokesmen (hence personally involved in the outcome of a case in which they were involved); Obicini v Bligh (1832) 8 Bing 335, 352 per Tindal, CJ. They were ultimately housed in Doctors' Commons. Prior to 1570, when membership of Doctors‚Äô Commons was made compulsory for advocates, some proctors had been members; Sir John Baker, \\"The English Legal Profession 1450‚Äì1550\\" in Wilfred Prest (ed), Lawyers in Early Modern Europe and America (Croom Helm, London, 1981), p. 24. They had much greater public exposure than advocates, and spent more time in court. Some proctors were bachelors, but some were non-graduates; Brian Levach, \\"The English Civilians, 1500‚Äì1750\\" in Wilfred Prest (ed), Lawyers in Early Modern Europe and America (Croom Helm, London, 1981), p. 110. The period of articles required was seven years; Harry Kirk, Portrait of a Profession. A History of the Solicitor‚Äôs Profession, 1100 to the Present Day (Oyez Publishing, London, 1976), p. 20. They were members of the Court of Arches, but, unlike the advocates, did not enjoy exclusive audience in the Court of Chivalry, where attorneys and solicitors could also practise; See, for example, Hungerford v Broad (1639) Acta Cu Mil (5), 151‚Äì2; Somerset v Good (1637) Cur Mil I, 232. Proctors were admitted by patent of a bishop, to practice in the consistory court of the diocese. Proctors gradually died out as a separate order after 1857 (they were never very numerous, there being some ten in practise in the Court of Arches, another eight in York, and smaller numbers at other consistory courts; Harry Kirk, Portrait of a Profession. A History of the Solicitor‚Äôs Profession, 1100 to the Present Day (Oyez Publishing, London, 1976), p. 20), as there was insufficient work for separate professions, as in that year the Court of Probate Act took away the proctors' monopoly of probate work (s 42), and gave them the right to be admitted as solicitors (s 43). In 1873 all solicitors, attorneys and proctors became solicitors of the supreme court. It is quite probable that Thomas ap Dafydd was a proctor in the St David's diocese consistory court, which met in St Peter's Church, Carmarthen; see N. Page, \\"Excavations in St Peter‚Äôs Church, Carmarthen, 2000\\" (2001) 41 Archaeology in Wales 51‚Äì61. and his wife Angharad.For the fifteenth century chancel generally, see W. Gwyn Thomas, \\"The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church\\" (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127‚Äì129. The great five-light east window is also of red stone,If Triassic, this red sandstone may well be of Cheshire origins; W. Gwyn Thomas, \\"The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church\\" (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127‚Äì129, at 129. with nineteenth century late Gothic style tracery.\\"Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr\\" in British Listed Buildings and Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497. There is an ornate semi-circular wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished cornice each side above a row of little fan-vaults separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The ceiling is finely finished with bosses at the intersection of the moulded principals and purlins. It was inserted in 1882‚Äì84.W. Gwyn Thomas, \\"The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church\\" (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127‚Äì129. This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of the fifteenth century ceiling.See, generally, Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as slots in the principals show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476‚Äì1516, with gaps);Llanbadarn Fawr was the most important source of income for the abbey at that time; W. Gwyn Thomas, \\"The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church\\" (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127‚Äì129, at 129. the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood.Vernacular Architecture 43 (2011) ‚Äì timbers felled 1489‚Äì91; RF Suggett/rcahmw/July 2011. The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch- braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof). The entrance to the chancel from the crossing has a red marble step, with mosaic, and Minton encaustic tile panels of a three-branch lamp, then another marble step and black marble main chancel flooring in small paving slabs. In the sanctuary there are a further three marble steps, with paving of pink marble with black in square or zigzag patterns. Chancel, looking towards the altar and the great east window, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr Priests‚Äô vestry, angle of wall adjoining to chancel There are three small square-panelled doors to the north wall of the chancel. One is at the base of the former rood loft stair, and this may be followed up a mural staircase built into the thickness of the wall, to a second door, which is high on the wall to the left. This would have been the entrance to the rood loft itself. The two doors are of slightly different style; the lower door has a triangular form not seen elsewhere in the church, suggesting early Tudor work. The upper door, which would originally have led to a loft, is a four-centred arch, possibly late Gothic, probably late fifteenth to early sixteenth century. The two could be contemporaneous with the work in the rest of the chancel. The third door is a vestry door further right, leading to the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of uncertain age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.In the later middle ages and particularly in the eighteenth century fireplaces began to invade sacristies; Warwick Rodwell, The Archaeology of Churches (Amberley, Stroud, 2013), p. 46.). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between the east end of the north transept and the original priests' vestry. Opposite the internal doors, in the south wall, there is a plain pointed priest's door with cut stone voussoirs, by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges. Priests‚Äô door in chancel, south side The 1880s Seddon high altar has a fine reredos across the east wall in red sandstone and white marble. There is red stone outer wall-panelling in squares of rose and vine, in a moulded frame. A white marble shelf or Retable on brackets over pink marble framing is behind the altar, with outer panels of white marble with a cross on vine background. The frame is stepped over the main reredos. Five white marble inner panels are separated by short half- octagonal red stone columns. There are Alpha and Omega symbolsAlpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and a title of Christ or of God in the Book of Revelation. at each end and three long panels, two of vine and a centre passion flower. Above these latter three are three white marble lettered panels, two with \\"Laus Deo\\" (\\"Praise be to God\\"), and the centre with \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\" (\\"Glory to God in the highest\\"), also red stone framed. Timber altar rails by Seddon, in open grid within panels, the top openings cusped, protect the sanctuary. The timber altar is also by Seddon, with three panels each of four quatrefoils. Following a common practice in convents and collegiate churches it is believed that there were usually choir stalls in the west end of the chancel (often called the choir or quire). Several Seddon pews remain here, although the choir today occupies the crossing. The crossing There is a red marble step to the chancel end of the crossing. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows light the staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing.This is known as a Holy Ghost hole, which could serve the purpose of allowing the image of a dove to be lowered for Pentecost. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century. The stalls and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, are similar to the pews in the nave (being of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading desks with triple pointed arches to the fronts and scrolled tops to the uprights. At the entrance to the south transept is the organ. This is by Forster and Andrews, of Hull. This organ building company was formed by James Alderson Forster (1818‚Äì1886) and Joseph King Andrews (1820‚Äì1896). The business developed and became one of the most successful of the North of England organ builder. The business was taken over by John Christie in 1924 and finally wound up in 1956. As well as their Hull headquarters, the company had branches in London and York. The organ dates from 1885. It was a gift from Sir Pryse Pryse of Gogerddan.Born 1838 and died 1906, he was created a baronet, the second creation of Pryse of Gogerddan, in 1866. He was the heir of Margaret (Pryse) and Edward Loveden Loveden, being her great grandson. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth baronet, in 1962. The organ has a pine case, and painted pipes. The south transept (the chapel of St Padarn and exhibition) The transepts have boarded ceilings with heavier ribs, and three by six panels, each panel subdivided in four, with brattishing and a band of quatrefoils to the wall-plate. Each transept has pointed tomb recesses in the end wall. South transept, east wall South transept west wall The south transept (popularly known as Capel y Dre [the Chapel of the Town] or Capel Aberystwyth) is now a museum and chapel of St Padarn. This was built 1985‚Äì1988, in the space of the old transept, to designs by Peter Lord, with work by a number of notable craftspeople. It was an initiative of the town rather than of the church. The exhibition depicts the rich history of the area, with displays on St Padarn, and local people like William Morgan. A facsimile copy of Morgan's Bible is displayed there. Another display tells the life story of Sulien. There are three niches or recesses, which may once have held the monumental effigies of some of its priests, but no effigies remain. The two larger niches are in the central chapel; a smaller niche houses the altar stone in the chapel of St Padarn, to the left. Coat of arms on south transept screen, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr A pitch pine screen with etched glass panels of winter and spring leads to the new rooms in the transept. The screen contains lines from the poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym, who is regarded as one of the leading Welsh poets and amongst the great poets of Europe in the Middle Ages. Dafydd ap Gwilym wrote his famous poem \\"The Girls of Llanbadarn\\" (\\"Merched Llanbadarn\\") about the church in the mid-fourteenth century. There is a ceramic coat of arms set into the screen on the right-hand side, with the motto \\"Gorau Gorchwyl Gwarchod\\" (\\"Best reference for protection\\"). Nineteenth century drawings of the pre-Christian Celtic standing stones at St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr The church contains two ancient carved stone crosses, since 1987 in the south transept. They were formally (before 1916) on display opposite the entrance to the south porch. Earlier still, before 1830, they had been situated in the angle between the south transept and the nave.\\"Miscellanea: Moved stones\\" (1917) 17 Archaeologia Cambrensis 163-6, at pp. 165‚Äì6. One in particular shows strong Irish and Viking influence. The first of the crosses is short and squat, with clear arms to each side, in a style reminiscent of pagan \\"Earth Mother\\" figurines. It has a crude roll-mould border to a roughly hewn cross. It is much eroded but has one crude human figure with spiral across the body; it may be late tenth century. South transept central room, showing position of standing crosses, and entrance to Sulien Room, Llanbadarn Fawr church The second cross is tall and slender, a free standing monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like the figure of a saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century.For the crosses generally see Nancy Edwards, A Corpus of Early Medieval Inscribed Stones and Stone Sculpture in Wales: Volume II: South-West Wales (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2007), pp. 135‚Äì41 and V.E. Nash-Williams, The Early Christian Monuments of Wales (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1950), no. 111, 112. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.Gerald Morgan identifies this as a likely point of origin. In the centre room of the transept there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red Chi-Ro emblem, with Alpha and Omega incised. A Chi-ro is an early form of Christogram, and is formed by the super imposition of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough Cornish granite monolith seat and prie-dieu, which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an incised red line. There is a white glazed tiled floor with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south wall above the stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, Dewi and (in the centre and above) Teilo. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a staff and chalice, with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory of members of the Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler & Bayne, London, around 1930, thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept. The staff borne by St Padarn in the window is probably intended to represent Curwen, which was revered at Llangorwen. It was given to him by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, along with a cloak or tunic, or so the Life of Padarn (Vita Sancti Paternus) tells us.The most complete copy of the Life is the Cotton Vespasian Axiv, written c.1200 at Brecon or Monmouth; E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 26. Padarn's crozier (whatever its true origin) became Llanbadarn's most important relic, still apparently extant in the twelfth century when Ieuan ap Sulien (d.1137), in a poem written on the life of his father Sulien, writes \\"no other relic can be compared with Cyrwen. A wonderful gift ‚Äì Padarn's staff\\". (Cyrwen means \\"white staff\\"). It was no doubt this same crozier ‚Äì assuming that the relic was genuine ‚Äì that Bishop Sulien brought with him to the meeting of William the Conqueror with the two Welsh princes, Rhys ap Tewdwr and Gruffudd ap Cynan at St. David's in 1081, when the English king recognised Lord Rhys as the legitimate ruler of Deheubarth;Thanks to Gerald Morgan for additional information; See also Neil Evans, \\"The Golden Age of the Welsh Saints: St Padarn\\" (http://www.parishofaberystwyth.org.uk/history.html). There are small enclosed chambers to either side of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service. The central room of the museum in the south transept, showing the altar stone, kneeling desk, and niches in the south wall, Llanbadarn Fawr To the right of the centre room are two small exhibition rooms entered through a screen with two further etched glass windows by Lord, of summer and spring. The first chamber, to the left and the smallest (the counterpart of the chapel of St Padarn), is Sulien's room, which has an incised slate floor slab and lettered text around wall from the Elegy of Rhygyfarch, both by Ieuan Rees. chapel of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr Church The larger room is entered from an outer chamber. In the outer chamber is located the Burma Star window (1985) with the Kohima Epitaph. The Kohima Epitaph is carved into the 2nd British Division memorial and remembers those who fought in the Battle of Kohima in north east India in the spring of 1944 between the British and Japanese. It also constitutes a memorial to Major- General Lewis Pugh, of Cwmerau, Glandyfi, who fought in the Second World War in the Far East, and who is a kinsman of Brigadier-General Lewis Pugh Evans, VC, who is buried in the churchyard. The other room, to the right has historical exhibits in display cases by Paul Roberts, and information panels lettered by Mihangel Morgan. The transepts ‚Äì the north (the Lady Chapel) The north transept (formerly known as Capel ClarachNamed after the township of Clarach, north of Aberystwyth. All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which as mentioned above was a chapel of ease built in the 1840s, is in Clarach, which later became a separate parish.) is now the Lady Chapel. In it are two recesses or niches, similar to those in the south transept. The larger niche, on the right, now houses a picture of St Padarn, dedicated in 2015. There is a small niche to the right, which is now used to store a service book and altar book stand when these are not in use on the altar. The stand is marked \\"In memoriam 3rd Officer Kathleen Miller, WRNS. Lost at sea on active service, August 19th 1941\\".Third Officer (Royal Navy equivalent Sub-Lieutenant) Miller (born 1907) was the daughter of Henry and Jane Anne Miller, of Englefield Green, Surrey, and was a native of Llanbadarn.

The Aguila (Master Arthur Firth) was the ship of the convoy commodore (Vice-Admiral [Commodore 2nd class] Patrick Edward Parker, DSO RNR (New Zealand) ADC) and sank within 90 seconds after being hit by two torpedoes. The commodore, five naval staff members, five gunners, 54 crew members and 88 passengers were lost. Among the passengers on board the Aguila were 21 women from the WRNS (Women's Royal Naval Service) who had volunteered for cypher and wireless duties in Gibraltar. None of the Wrens survived the sinking. As a tribute to their memory, a lifeboat named Aguila Wren was built and launched on 28 June 1952 for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution; http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1063.html. The statue of the Virgin and Child, to the left of the altar, was given by Canon Geraint Vaughan-Jones in memory of his parents. He was one of the leading members of the group of twentieth century clergy who was able to reinvigorate the tradition of plygain singing (an abbreviated form of morning service interspersed with and followed by carols sung by soloists and groups) within the Welsh church. Canon Vaughan-Jones (1929‚Äì2002) has a memorial in the churchyard in the angle of the south transept and the nave. The north transept fittings are from 1936 and are by Caroe & Passmore. They include a finely carved reredos with panelling each side, the altar, rails (in the form of a long kneeler), a lectern, pews and kneelers, all in pale oak. The reredos has a carved Crucifixion, with St Mary and St John. There is a small Orthodox icon, a Theotokos, or Virgin and Child, to the right of the reredos. It is a reproduction of an early icon, printed on paper mounted on wood, from Stylite Icons, Welshpool, and probably dates from the 1980s. Lady Chapel, showing reredos The floor of the Lady Chapel is of quarry tiles, with encaustic tiles at the entrance from the crossing. The only monument that survives in the floor is a brass plaque in memory of \\"J J\\" with the date 1822, superimposed over a cross patonce. The Lady Chapel from the crossing, Llanbadarn Fawr The nave The nave, which is aisleless, was formerly known as the Capel Hir (Long Chapel). The pews in the nave are by Seddon and are of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints. The stonework is almost all nineteenth century to the nave south wall, less so elsewhere. Nave, south wall The nave roof becomes increasingly elaborate towards the chancel. The nave roof is of eight by twelve panels, boarded with bosses and brattished wall plates. The ancient font by the west door dates from the twelfth century,Though it had previously been thought to be mid-thirteenth century; Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 495; Tyrrell Green, \\"Cardiganshire fonts\\" (1914) 1(4) Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 9‚Äì26, at pp. 24‚Äì5. and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only ornament on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble,Purbeck Marble is not, strictly speaking, a marble, as it is not a metamorphic rock, like a true marble, but is so-called because it can take a fine polish. See http://www.stone.uk.com/history/. which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary evidence suggests that the massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway.; Timothy Palmer, \\"The Purbeck Marble Font in St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr\\" (2014) 18(2) Ceredigion 29‚Äì40. The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron. Twelfth century Purbeck marble font In contrast to the antiquity of the font ‚Äì probably the oldest piece visible in the church, aside from the Celtic crosses ‚Äì the pulpit dates from 1879. It was presented by the Bishop of St David's (the scholarly Basil Jones, bishop 1874‚Äì1897), in memory of his mother. It is in Beer stone ashlar Gothic, formed of a drum with two cusped panels with carved stone reliefs of Saints John and Paul by Hugh Stannus, with square rosettes and leaf-carving in spandrels flanking, and a Gothic column with a large capital for a book rest. Opposite this is the usual brass eagle lectern. Both pulpit and lectern are placed in the archway between crossing and nave. Inscribed brass plaque on east side of pulpit, in memory of Jane Jones, mother of Basil Jones, Bishop of St David's The nave and transept light fittings are by George Pace and date from the 1960s. The porch and arch The nave inner porch in oak with long narrow leaded lights was made by George Pace in the 1960s. The porch and entrance c.1860. Through doorway it shows the priest administrating holy baptism at the font. Printed by Day & Haghan, lithographers to the Queen. The west door, actually in the south side of the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain.According to Meyrick the style is similar to one which was in vogue in the beginning of the twelfth century, and an example may be seen in Llandaff Cathedral, erected by Bishop Urban in 1120. A similar piece was found in Abbey Cwmhir; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810). A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201.The name Strata Florida is a corruption of the Welsh Ystrad Fflur, and has a double meaning; \\"Valley of (the river of) Flowers\\". Ystrad corrupts into \\"Strata\\", while Fflur (\\"Flowers\\") is also the name of the nearby river. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else. The porch, showing the outer nineteenth century arch and the inner ancient arch The nineteenth century porch has a big ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded segmental pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three steps up to the fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side. Porch east wall The monuments A large range of seventeenth and eighteenth century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some for members of the major landowning families in the (original) parish, including the Powells of NanteosThis family claims descent from Edwin ap Gronow Prince of Tegeingl (d. 1073). Dafydd ap Philip ap Hywel is said to have been the first ‚Äòap Hywel (whence Powell) connected with Llechwedd-dyrus, the first seat of the family. Though like the Pryses of Gogerddan the Powells were an ancient family, they were not quite so long at Nanteos as the Pryses had been at Gogerddan. The earliest recorded occupier of the estate was Colonel John Jones, who raised a regiment of foot at Nanteos, in defence of King Charles I during the Civil War and was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire for 1665. He had no sons and so the estate was inherited in 1666 by his daughter Anne, who had married a Dutch mining engineer, Cornelius Le Brun, who in turn became High Sheriff in 1676. Their only daughter Averina duly inherited, having married William Powell (1658‚Äì1738) of Llechwedd Dyrus, and passed it on in 1738 to their eldest son, Thomas. The last of the Powells, Margaret Powell, who died in 1951, was the widow of Edward Athelstan Lewis Powell, who had died in 1930. Their only son was killed in the First World War; his monument is in the chancel: \\"In ever loving and honoured memory of William Edward George Pryse Wynne Powell, Lieut Welsh Guards, only child of Capt. and Mrs E.A.L. Powell of Nanteos, and grandson of William Beauclerk Powell of Nanteos and Sir Pryse Pryse Bart. of Gogerddan. Born March 8th 1899 and killed near Buvianies in France Nov 6th 1918, while gallantly leading his men in action. Brave, kind, and true, he endeared himself to all during his short life, and died as he had lived, a true and very gallant Welsh gentleman. 'mil gwell yw marw'n fachgen dewr. Nia byw yn fachgen llwfr!'\\". Edward Athelstan Lewis Powell had himself died \\"from the effects of an illness contracted while serving in Mesopotamia in the Great War\\". Mrs Powell bequeathed the property in 1951 to Mrs Elizabeth Mirylees, a distant relative of her husband, who moved in 1956. She sold it in 1967 to Geoff and Rose Bliss, who lived there until 1983, opening the building to the public. Since then there have been several owners but the mansion now operates as a hotel. In 2004 it was purchased by the Saxoncourt Group, and has been extensively restored; Gerald Morgan (ed), Nanteos: A Welsh House and its family (Gomer, Llandysul, 2001). (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan.The Pryses of Gogerddan traced their lineage back to Gwaethfod, Lord of Ceredigion (c. 1057). They settled at Gogerddan in the first half of the fourteenth century, the first member of the family to live there probably being Rhys ap Dafydd Llwyd. Plas Gogerddan was originally built in the latter half of the fifteenth century. Sion Prys (John Pryse) became the first to use the surname Pryse and was the first member of the Gogerddan family to become an M.P. (1553‚Äì1555). The estate was broken up in the first half of the twentieth century, and much of the remaining lands and Plas Gogerddan were acquired by Aberystwyth University in 1950. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos.The inscription to this monument states: \\"Here lie the earthly remains of John Jones of Nant E√≤s in the County of Cardigan, Esq. Lieutent Coll. Of a Foot Regimt raised there for the service of Kg Charles ye 1 st of bld Memory who by the Grace of God was true to the Church in time of persecution to the King in time of Rebellion when for doing good, he suffered much evil and after when it lay in his power he required none. Who in the midst of much business and tedious Trouble was a great example of Learning Himself, and a Furtherer of it to others. A Loving Husband, A tender Father, And a faithful Friend, Who lived to see this Kingdom restor'd, but was called to receive his reward in a better, In the year of our Lord 1666, of his own Age 32.

With whom and her Father she hopes in God's good time to rest here In peace, and at the last Day with them to partake of A Happy Resurrection.\\" Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, to the left of the north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side of the altar ‚Äì the epistle side of the chancel ‚Äì is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials. There is a very fine mosaic floor to the centre aisle and cross aisles by Seddon with inset lozenge panels of Minton encaustic tiles of kneeling priests. The windows Every window in the church contains coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and at the ends of the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above. The east window is a memorial to Mrs Rosa Edwyna Powell (died 1860), of Nanteos, and her daughter Harriet Edwyna (died 1857), and was inserted by direction of the Will of her son George (died 1882). It depicts the Transfiguration of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was designed by Seddon and installed in 1884. There are other stained glass windows, including the three western lancets, filled with stained glass by the parishioners in 1894, in memory of the Reverend John Pugh, curate 1856‚Äì1861 and vicar 1861‚Äì1893. The last window that had contained plain glass was given stained glass in the late twentieth century. For many years well-known local musician Professor Ian Parrott regularly sat beneath this window during services. Before he died, at the age of 96, he commissioned a stained glass window ‚Äì as he said, he would like to be able to enjoy it before he died.Parrott was a prolific Anglo-Welsh composer and writer on music. His distinctions included the first prize of the Royal Philharmonic Society for his symphonic poem \\"Luxor\\", and commissions by the BBC and Yale University, and for many leading British musicians. In 1958 his \\"cor anglais\\" concerto was first performed at the Cheltenham Festival, and in 1963 his cello concerto was given by William Pleeth and the Hall√© Orchestra ‚Äì both concertos were conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. From 1951 to 1983 he was Gregynog Professor of Music at Aberystwyth University. The window, which was designed by John Petts, is on the theme of \\"Music in Praise of the Lord\\". The nineteenth century restoration work There were still fine mediaeval screens in the church in 1810, possibly lost when repairs were done in 1813‚Äì16; they were gone by 1862.Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 496. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: > The chancel and north transept are separated from the rest of the church by > light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they > display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh. They are > coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are now so > covered with dirt as to be scarce perceptible. Nothing now survives of these carved screens, which were made of oak. Nineteenth century etchings of the now lost interior woodwork, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr In poor condition in the mid-nineteenth century, the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans were made by William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867‚Äì84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages at a cost of ¬£8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of the nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, the construction of a new altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880. Seddon thought that the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and proposed inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones,Though the restoration of the church 1867‚Äì84 was severe, the bishop, who took an active role, was not without some claim to architectural and historical expertise. While at Oxford (which he left in 1865, at the age of 43, having been a lecturer in modern history and the classics, to be vicar of Bishopsthorpe), he showed himself to have a keen interest in archaeological and architectural affairs. He is credited with the design of his parish church at Llangynfelyn. From 1848 through to 1851 he was one of the general secretaries of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, and then joint editor of its journal, Archaeologia Cambrensis, in 1854. Jones was also secretary of the Oxford Architectural Society. and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work.We know that the church was still being thatched in the early eighteenth century. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling. The nave was in poorest condition and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced in the first phase in 1868‚Äì9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave,At the Reformation all the figurative paintings would have been obliterated with limewash, though they wouldn't have necessarily been destroyed, per se. including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance.W. J. Hemp in (1931) 86(2) Archeaologia Cambrensis 405. St Christopher usually faces the entrance to the Church in his role as patron saint of travellers. Unfortunately this and other traces of frescoA fresco is where the painting is executed onto a fresh or wet plaster. With buon fresco (literally \\"true fresco\\"), paintings are executed using powder pigments ground and mixed to a paste with water. They become bound with the wall surface through the carbonation of the lime in the lime plaster. Lime putty (calcium hydroxide) sets through a process of carbonation with the water element evaporating off and atmospheric carbon dioxide being absorbed into the plaster to form calcium carbonate. As this process occurs, minute quantities of lime pass into the pigment layer and carbonate, thereby binding the pigments; http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/medieval-wall- paintings/medieval-wall-paintings.htm. could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made.E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 55. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly. The tower and transepts were restored 1878‚Äì80 with a short spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates from this time. William Morris, on behalf of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877The SPAB was founded by William Morris, Philip Webb and others, in that year, to oppose what they saw as destructive \\"Restoration\\" of ancient buildings then occurring in Victorian Britain; Andrea Donovan, William Morris and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (Routledge, London, 2007). asking for a less severe restoration. Unfortunately much had already been destroyed. The chancel finally was restored 1880‚Äì1884. The chancel glass by Stephen Belham is to Seddon's designs.S. Belham & Co. was a company established by Stephen Belham (1827‚Äì91) in 1865 on Buckingham Palace Road in London. The firm made several stained glass windows in Wales to the design of Seddon, and then by Henry Murray (1852‚Äì1929), who may have subsequently acquired the business; http://imagingthebible.llgc.org.uk/person/274. Further repairs and fittings were done 1935‚Äì1936 by Caroe & Passmore (primarily to the Lady Chapel), and in 1960 by George Pace (the interior porch, and light fittings).http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-9832-church-of-st-padarn- llanbadarn-fawr#.VTBJOPnF-So.

The museum and chapel of St Padarn are the most recent works, aside from the re-casting and re-hanging of the peal of bells. The listing of the building One of the crosses in Llanbadarn Fawr, in the churchyard pre-1916 The church has been listed grade I since 21 January 1964. It was listed grade I as being the pre-eminent mediaeval church of the region, with outstanding monuments and fine later nineteenth century fittings and stained glass.Additionally, see National Library of Wales SD/F/236-239 faculties 1878, 1906, 1925 and 1936; National Library of Wales, Llanbadarn Fawr PCC records; Lambeth Palace, ICBS 06854: restoration papers; Llanbadarn Fawr drwy'r canrifoedd/ through the centuries, 1994; Martin Harrison, Victorian Stained Glass (Barrie & Jenkins, London, 1979), pp. 58‚Äì9: the glass by Belham; (1848) 7 The Ecclesiologist, pp. 250‚Äì1; Carmarthen Journal 1/8/1862, 3/1/1868, 23/2/1883, 19/9/1884, 25/5/1894; The Builder 21/8/1869, 26/7/1879, 3/7/1880, 19/4/1884; Building News 26/8/1870; The Welshman 24/1/1868, 24/11/1876, 15/3/1878, 9/6/1880; The British Architect, 1882 (plans by Seddon); J.O.

Churchyard The north aspect of the church from the churchyard The churchyard covers some two acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern ‚Äì many of them are from the nineteenth century ‚Äì but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, contains some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees.Some of the trees are certified as being over 500 years old. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.\\"On the north side of the church the buildings were, probably, a part of the old monastery, a pointed arch, and other circumstances in them, indicating great antiquity\\"; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810). A view from the northwest, showing part of the churchyard Lewis Pugh Evans Lewis Pugh Evans, VC Brigadier- General Lewis Pugh Evans, of Lovesgrove, a World War I Victoria Cross recipient and former churchwarden, is buried in the churchyard. His grave is marked by a simple slate headstone giving names and dates of birth and death. Burial Location VC Holders in North Wales. He was a kinsman of Major-General Lewis Pugh, who is commemorated in the south transept. Evans was awarded the VC when, as an acting Lieutenant Colonel in The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), on 4 October 1917, near Zonnebeke, Belgium, he was Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment: > For most conspicuous bravery and leadership. Lt.-Col. Evans took his > battalion in perfect order through a terrific enemy barrage, personally > formed up all units, and led them to the assault.

Evans was mentioned in despatches seven times and was awarded the DSO and Bar, the Order of Leopold (Belgium) and the French Croix de Guerre. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1919, and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1938.. He also had the 1914 Star and Clasp, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. He was a Justice of the Peace on the local bench as well as Deputy Lieutenant for Cardiganshire and a Freeman of the borough of Aberystwyth. He was also an Officer of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/vvashcr3.htm. Since 1991 a memorial plaque has been on the wall near the village war memorial. Ancillary building A lean-to structure at the end of the north transept houses the heating system. There is a new western end to this building, constructed 2014, and the eastern end (which includes the entrance) can only be entered via the north door to the choir vestry. The churchyard gates The churchyard gate to the south west of the church is listed grade II (26 October 2002). Given the relative size of the churchyard, the church and each of the two gates have their own postcode: the postal address of the church is Primrose Hill, Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion SY23 3QZ, the postcode of the west gate is SY23 3QY.\\"Churchyard gate to SW of Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr\\" British Listed Buildings. The lychgate to the south east is also listed grade II (25 October 2002), and is located at SY23 3RA. It is a stone gabled lychgate with arched entries and good iron gates.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Metropolitan Archdiocese of Ljubljana\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016  The Archdiocese  The archdiocese's motherchurch and thus seat of its archbishop is the Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Ljubljana; it also contains minor basilicas in Brezje and Stiƒçna. The See of Ljubljana had been vacant, its former archbishop was, until his 2013 resignation, Anton Stres, who was appointed Archbishop of Ljubljana, and thus Primate of Slovenia, by Pope Benedict XVI on 28 November 2009.  History  From 811, the territory of the Ljubljana Archdiocese was part of the ecclesiastical territory of the Patriarch of Aquileia. Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, erected on 6 December 1461 the Diocese of Laibach, which was confirmed six months later, on 6 September 1462, by Pope Pius II. Several days later, it was taken from the jurisprudence of the Aquileia and directly subjected to the Holy See. On 3 March 1787, it became an archdiocese and a metropolis, which it remained until 1807, when it was for political reasons degraded to a common diocese. The Nazi persecution of the Church in annexed Slovenia was akin to that which occurred in Poland. Within six weeks of the Nazi occupation, only 100 of the 831 priests in the Diocese of Maribor and part of the Diocese of Ljubljana remained free. Clergy were persecuted and sent to concentration camps, religious Orders had their properties seized.Vincent A. Lapomarda; The Jesuits and the Third Reich; 2nd Edn, Edwin Mellen Press; 2005; pp 232, 233 The diocese was again elevated to an archdiocese by Pope John XXIII on 22 December 1961, and to a metropolis by Pope Paul VI on 22 November 1968. Today the archdiocese has two suffragan sees, Koper (since 1977) and Novo Mesto (since 2006). It is the principal see of Slovenia; one living former archbishop, Franc Rode, CM, was promoted to a Curial office (Prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life) and made a Cardinal.

It was dedicated to the 7th century Saint Mildred the Virgin, daughter of Merewald, sub-king of the West Mercians. Of medieval origin, the church was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren following its destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666. One of the few City churches to retain Wren's original fittings into the 20th century,\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert, C;Weinreb, D;Keay, J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008 St Mildred's was destroyed by bombs in 1941. The medieval church The earliest record of the church of St Mildred is of its rebuilding in around 1300. This was probably paid for by Lord Trenchaunt of St. Albans, who was buried in the Church at about that time. Sir John Shadworth, Lord Mayor in 1401, who was also buried in the church, gave a parsonage house, a vestry and a churchyard. A description by John Strype indicates that the medieval church was an aisled building, with a clerestory. The patronage of the church belonged to the monastery of St Mary Overie until 1533, when it passed into private hands. Strype records that the church was repaired throughout in 1628, when most of the north wall, the nave arcades and the windows above them were rebuilt. A major benefactor of the church during the 17th century was Sir Nicholas Crisp, a wealthy merchant and ardent supporter of Charles I, who, by 1663, owned the advowson of the church. His gifts included two large silver flagons, which were still in use into the 20th century, and a five light stained glass east window depicting the Spanish Armada, Elizabeth I, the Gunpowder Plot, the plague of 1625, and portraits of himself, his wife and children. He was interred in his family vault in the church, although his heart was buried at Hammersmith. St Mildred's was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666. Its silver plate, however, survived, having been taken to safety in Hackney in a hired carriage. After the fire the parish of the church of St Margaret Moses, which was also destroyed but not rebuilt, was united to that of St Mildred. Rebuilding The original interior with Baroque furnishing and the main altar. The church was rebuilt between 1677 and 1683\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p97:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren at a cost of ¬£3,705 13s 6d. It was long and wide. The new building was without aisles, the ceiling taking the form of a plastered dome constructed within the roof space, with short barrel vaults at the east and west ends. The dome was decorated with cherubs in high relief (removed in 1841), and supported on pendentives with elaborate plaster decoration. There was one window in each of the four walls. The frontage to Bread Street, at the western end, was faced in Portland stone with a curved pediment, but the rest of the church, including the tower, was of brick. There was a wooden spire, covered in lead.  Evangelical Influence  In the late eighteenth century, several prominent Evangelical clergymen attended St. Mildred. The two most famous are Thomas Scott the Commentator, and Daniel Wilson, who eventually became the Bishop of Calcutta. Scott \\"was appointed to the Sunday afternoon lectureship in Bread Street, February 16, 1790, and retained it till he was chosen sole chaplain to the Lock, in March, 1802.\\" At the time, \\"his congregation seldom much exceeded a hundred in number; but they were attentive hearers, and he had reason to believe that his preaching there was useful to many persons, several of whom have since become instruments of good to others.\\" Scott's lectures took place on Sunday afternoons, and Daniel Wilson was among those who attended. Nineteenth and twentieth centuries The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley married Mary Godwin in the church on 30 December 1816. Thomas Gilbank Ackland was rector of the church from 1818 until his death in 1844. In 1898 many bodies were disinterred and removed to Brookwood Cemetery. The remains of Sir Nicholas Crisp, found in a stone coffin, were, however, reunited with his heart at Hammersmith. In 1932 a bust of Arthur Philip, the first Governor of New South Wales was unveiled on the west wall of the church.It now stands outside 25 Cannon Street Huelin (Ibid) The church, with its original fittings, remained in good condition until its destruction by bombing in 1941 when most of its records were lost;Details for record hunters (Genealogy) The registers had, however, been published by the Harleian Society in 1912. The parish became one of the eight to have been reunited with St Mary-le-Bow at different times. The site was excavated by the Museum of London Department of Urban Archaeology between 1973 and 1974. Remains of a 1st-century Roman building, probably a house, were found beneath those of the church. The former site of the church is now the location of the 30 Cannon Street office building.

The subject undergoes several stages to give a direct impression onto materials such as lead, gum, and photographic plates, which are then used in the printing process. Benjamin Franklin's nature printed currency (1779) While some sources state that Benjamin Franklin invented nature printing from leaf casts, using a copper plate press, in 1737 to thwart counterfeiters of paper money bills, other sources also report Franklin's friend, Philadelphia naturalist Joseph Breintnall, to have made contact nature prints from leaves about 1730.

The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, both of which are smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes. For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in copper by the electrotype process. Further reading *Eric P.

Early life and college career Born in Wilburton, Oklahoma, Duane Wood was the son of Edgar Scott and Jessie (Ray) Wood. A multi-sport athlete at Wilburton High School, playing football, baseball and basketball as well as running track, Wood received a football scholarship to Oklahoma State University and appeared as both a running back and a defensive back. He scored all but one of OSU's points in their 15-6 Bluegrass Bowl victory over Florida State in 1958 (the only year the game was played). Duane married his high school sweetheart Saundra Callahan on June 29, 1957; they remained married until her death in 2004. Professional career Prior to the NFL Draft, (It was later learned he was to be drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers), Wood headed north to the Canadian Football League in 1959. He signed a contract with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats immediately following; and, after being named the offensive MVP of the Blue-Grey Game in Montgomery AL. In his rookie season, Wood was named to the CFL All-Star Team, with 237 yards rushing on offense; on defense, he recorded three interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. Wood was also an excellent kick returner, averaging 9.3 yards on 51 punt returns in an era without blocking on punt returns. After playing six games with the Tiger-Cats in 1960 (mostly on defense), Wood jumped to the Dallas Texans (Now Kansas City Chiefs) of the brand-new American Football League (AFL). He played in the 1962 AFL Championship game in Houston TX, a 20‚Äì17 thrilling Texans win over the two- time AFL Champion Houston Oilers. The game was the longest Professional American Football Championship game up to that time; almost one and one-half quarters of \\"sudden death\\". The winning field goal for the Texans was kicked by Tommy Brooker, University of Alabama. In the1963 AFL season, Wood moved with the team to Kansas City and was selected to the American Football League All-Star game in San Diego CA. in all, he played five seasons with the franchise. In 1965, he headed back to Canada to finish his career with the Edmonton Eskimos. In Edmonton, he was reunited with one of his Oklahoma State University coaches, the late, great Neil Armstrong. After football Upon retiring from football, Wood returned to Wilburton to manage several private businesses: a clothing store; a bowling alley; and, a recreation center/eatery. Duane worked for three years with a dredging service on the Arkansas River in Ft. Smith, Arkansas. He was awarded the \\"Medal of Commendation\\" from the US Army Corps of Engineers for single-handedly rescuing and saving the lives of three people whose boat had capsized on the river. Wood subsequently returned to his hometown of Wilburton. He was employed by the Kiamichi Rural Electric Cooperative. He retired as the general manager after twenty years of service. Wood died on July 23, 2012, at the age of 74.

History  Naval Observatory (1821-1912) Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory was founded in 1821 by Admiral Aleksey Samuilovich Greig (1775‚Äì1845) as a Naval Observatory to ensure the Black Sea Fleet with time, nautical charts and teaching naval officers to utilize astronomical methods of orientation. The top of the Spassky hill, the city of Nikolaev‚Äôs highest hill (52M), was chosen as the construction site for the observatory. The designer of the main building project was Fyodor Ivanovich Wunsch (1770‚Äì1836), who was also the main architect of the Black Sea Admiralty. Karl Frederick Knorre was appointed to the position of first director on the recommendation of Vasiliy Yakovlevich Struve (1801‚Äì1883). In addition to his work in the preparation of naval officers, K. Knorre began the scientific astronomical research. In the history of astronomy he is known as the author of the Berlin Academy of Science‚Äôs 5th sheet of the star map, by the help of which the minor planets Astrea and Flora were discovered. K. Knorre held the position of director of the Observatory for 50 years. The second director Ivan Y. Kortatstsi (1837‚Äì1903) continued the astronomical research at the Observatory, cataloging the position of stars later named the ‚ÄúNikolaev Zone‚Äù. In the marine period of the observatory, K.H. Knorre and I.E. Kortatstsi carried out hydrographic survey works on the Azov, Black and Marmara Seas. They conducted an inventory of, and more precise identification of geographical coordinates of many control points on these sea maps. The fleet was equipped with precision instruments and perfected methods of determining the time (longitude) and latitude. Nikolaev department of Pulkovo Observatory (1912-1991) Until [1911] the Observatory belonged to the Navy Ministry, and from 1912 to 1991 NAO became the southern branch of the Pulkovo Observatory. The main objective of the Observatory at that time was the spread of the Pulkovo absolute star catalogs to the southern sky and the implementation of regular observations of the Sun and Solar system bodies. To equip the new department the Repsold Vertical Circle and the passage instrument (Freiberg-Kondratiev) were moved from Odessa. The Observatory managed to survive and was preserved as a scientific institution during a period of great distress in our society: the First World War, the Revolution and then Civil War. Boris Pavlovich Ostaschenko-Kudryavtsev (1879‚Äì1956) was the director at that times. The Renaissance of the Observatory after the ordeal is associated with the name of the fourth director Leonid Ivanovich Semenov (1878‚Äì1965), who headed the Observatory in [1923]. In [1931], the highly accurate Time Service was created by NAO, which contributed to national and international programs to determine the exact time. In 1935 the observatory was included in the system of institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR as a branch of the Pulkovo. During the Great Patriotic War from August 1941 to March 1944 the observatory was occupied by the Germans. Director L.I. Semenov managed to keep it from serious injury and destruction. In the postwar period Jakov E. Gordon (1912‚Äì1978) was appointed to the post of director of the observatory (in 1951). In [1955], Repsold Meridian Circle was transported to Nikolaev from Pulkovo after reconstruction and a number of upgrades, on which different observational programs were carried out during 40 years. In 1961, Zonal Astrograph made by the ‚ÄúCarl Zeiss‚Äù firm was transferred from Pulkovo to NAO and the history of photographic astrometry has begun. Nikolaev photographic observations of Solar system bodies are among some of the most accurate in the World. In 1957-1969 visual and photographic observation satellites were carried out to determine their orbits. In 70 ‚Äì 80s, the observatory was the initiator and main administrant of several scientific expeditions for observations upon conditions of Polar night and high mountains in the Caucasus on the West Spitsbergen island. In total, nearly 35 different catalogs were created by NAO with the positions of celestial bodies. In 1978 Rima Timofeevna Fedorova (1934 born) became director of the observatory. Gennady Pinigin (current director, 1943 born) took up the position of director in 1986. Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory Modern view of the site In 1992, Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory gained the status of an independent scientific institution, and in 2002 received official status as a Research Institute. Maintaining its scientific traditions, NAO has expanded the research topics in the area of astronomical instrumentation and research of Near-Earth Space. In 1995, the NAO created and brought into action an automatic telescope with a CCD detector - Axial Meridian Circle (AMC), which in 1999 was included in the Tentative list of objects that make up the national property of Ukraine. After upgrade and an equipping the Zonal astrograph with CCD detector, it was renamed to the Multi-Channel Telescope (MCT). In 2004 Fast Robotic Telescope (FRT) was put into service. The regular observations of near space objects are conducted on FTR, within the framework of participation in the National Space Program of Ukraine‚Äôs monitoring and analysis of Space conditions. In 2009, the first Ukrainian mobile telescope \\"Mobitel\\" was created. It consists of four independent mount equipped with modern CCD cameras with control system program in the remote access mode. Currently work on the creation of Nikolaev Virtual Observatory (NikVO) as part of Ukrainian National Virtual Observatory is being conducted.

The original Simoniz Company was founded in 1910, making it the oldest car care brand in the United States. History The Simoniz Company came into being in 1910. The company was created by George Simons, who developed a cleaner and a carnauba wax product for car finishes. Along with Elmer Rich of the Great Northern Railway, the two organized the Simons Manufacturing Company. In 1912, Mr. Rich and his brother, R.J. Rich, acquired full ownership. They changed the name of the firm to Simoniz Company and located the first office and backroom factory at 2121 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago which was at the time was known as \\"Automobile Row\\". Elmer Rich used the prominence of radio to promote his product with the slogan \\"Motorists Wise, Simoniz\\". An Institutional Division was officially organized in 1954. This division offered a line of floor waxes, finishes, polishes, cleaners and sponges that were formulated and packaged expressly for business and public large-volume users. It was during 1957 that Vista One-Step Cleaner/Wax entered the market. In 1965, Morton International purchased the controlling interest in Simoniz Company, adding Master Wax-Detergent Proof and Smooth-Pre Softened products to the line. In 1976, Simoniz was acquired by Union Carbide. Union Carbide introduced numerous products into the marketplace, including Shines Like the Sun, Super Poly, Body Guard, Double Wax, Simoniz II, Shine Booster and Super Blue. In 1986, as a part of the divestiture of Union Carbide, a management lead LBO called First Brands Corp. was formed and Simoniz was among the brands purchased. In 1988, First Brands entered into a license agreement with Syndet Products, Inc. to manufacture and distribute on-line Simoniz brand products nationally to the car wash industry, which eventually expanded to include detail shop and janitorial/sanitation (JanSan) cleaning products. In 1997, Syndet Products purchased the Simoniz brand from First Brands Corp., and renamed the company Simoniz USA, Inc. In popular culture The term \\"Simoniz\\" or \\"Simonizing\\" has entered the public lexicon as a means to wax one's car. In Arthur Miller's play, Death of a Salesman published in 1949, the terms Simonize and Simonizing are used on several occasions, e.g. \\"...Remember those days? The way Biff used to simonize that car? The dealer refused to believe there was eighty thousand miles on it.\\" A 1960s Simoniz television advertisement featured The Three Stooges. The advertisement featured one of Joe DeRita's first on-screen appearances as the third stooge; as DeRita had recently joined the group at the time the commercial was made, his role was not yet well-defined, and he had a small role compared to the other two stooges. In the 1981 film Arthur, Dudley Moore's character negotiates with a prostitute over her services, including that she \\"Simoniz my car\\". Simoniz is known for being a major sponsor of Datsun racecars in the Trans-Am Series in the 1960s. A can of Simoniz wax is also featured in the 1983 film A Christmas Story as a Christmas gift. \\"Simonize\\" is the name of a song by Pete Yorn from his album Musicforthemorningafter.

He is famous for taking four noble youths ‚Äì \\"the Rugby Four\\" ‚Äì to the United Kingdom to receive a modern education (for the first time in Tibet's history).Tsering Yangdzom, Shao Da, On the dominant Dalai Lama's Yabgzhis families , China Tibet Information Center. As a child, Lhalu attended a private school at the foot of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. He then went on to a school for children of secular officials at Jokhang monastery.Tibetan Consultative Body Member Says Dalai Lama \\"Stooge of the Westerners\\", Xinhua News Agency, 6 mars 1996. Earlier official positions Following the Dalai Lama's death in 1934, Lungshar Dorje Tsegyel, a moderate reformist who advocated replacing lifelong tenure for the government ministers (Kalon) with a vote for a four-year term, was outman≈ìuvred by the more conservative minister Trim√∂n; Lungshar was arrested and punished by blinding. All of Lungshar's descendants were then banned from government service. Lhalu had entered government service as a boy in 1927, but he was dismissed from his position after his father's arrest.Cirenyangzong, The aristocratic families in Tibetan history, op. cit., p. 24: \\"Lungsharwa Dorje Tsegyel, who was in the 13th's favor, advocated abolishing lifelong tenure for the Galoin; instead, a 'referendum' should be held to vote the Galoin for a four-year term. Since his radical reform was targeted at the Gaxag - the supreme administrative organization of the local government, and thus encroached on the interests of the big nobility, after the 13th's death Lungshar was removed from office and his eyes were gouged out. The government also issued orders that none of the Lungsharwa family's offspring could inherit a noble title or have an official career.\\" Lhalu was later adopted into the wealthy family of Lungshar's common law wife, the Lhalu family,The Lhalu owned a magnificent mansion about one kilometer north of the Potala Palace. The three-story residence was originally built by the Tibetan government for Tsangyang Gyatso, the 6th Dalai Lama. See Tsering Yangdzom, Shao Da, On the dominant Dalai Lama's Yabgshis' families , China Tibetology.Sir Charles Bell took a picture of it while on a mission to Lhasa in 1920-1921.

By making the public claim that Lungshar was not his biological father, and by applying in the name of Lhalu se and paying large bribes,Tsering Yangdzom, Shao Da, op. cit.: \\"Goldstein writes: 'Lungshar's' son Lhalu later petitioned to be reinstated as a government official, arguing that he was not really Lungshar's son. He claimed his biological father was Shekarlingpa, another aristocrat,and both his mother and Shekarlingpa swore that this was so. Using this rather feeble ploy (and massive bribes), he was reinstated under the family name of Lhalu and given the Seynamba status.\\" he was able to become an official again in 1937, after which he became increasingly influential.

It had produced the eighth and twelfth incarnations of the Dalai Lama and thus attained nobility.\\" In 1940, Lhalu married a daughter of the Labrang Nyingpa (Thonpa) family. In 1941, he was promoted to 4th rank and made a tsep√∂n.Lhalu Se, Tibet Album. British photography in Central Tibet 1920-1950 (entry from Who Was Who In Tibet? by Frank Drauschke). In 1946, he was appointed a shape, i.e. a member of cabinet, by the regent, Taktra.Anna Louise Strong, When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet, op. cit., chap. VIII Lhalu(s Serfs Accuse: \\"He had been one of the six kaloons who made up the kashag, the local secular government under the Dalai Lama ; it was said that he had bribed the kashag in 1945 with two hundred and fifty thousand taels of silver for the post. He had then become both secretary and vice-chairman of the kashag at different times.\\" He played an active role in the arrest of the former regent, Reting Rinpoche, when Reting was charged with attempting to assassinate Taktra. Governor of Kham Shortly after the Reting incident, Lhalu was appointed governor of Kham, with his headquarters in Chamdo. He was serving in this position in 1949 when the People's Republic of China consolidated its control of China proper and began a build-up of troops in the provinces bordering Tibet. Lhalu began preparations to resist Chinese forces, but he was replaced by Ngab√∂ Ngawang Jigme before the invasion actually occurred. Robert W. Ford's testimony In his book Captured in Tibet, Robert W. Ford, a former British radio operator in Kham, portrays Lhalu \\"as typical of the more progressive Tibetan officials. They knew they were backward, and genuinely wanted to learn and to modernize their country - so long as no harm was done to their religion.\\" Although Lhalu had never left Tibet (unlike his father, who \\"was one of the very few Tibetans who ever went to Britain\\"), he \\"was keenly interested in the outside world and studied the pictures in [Ford's] illustrated magazines. He wanted to know about tractors and other agricultural machinery and about industrial processes in the West.\\"Robert W. Ford, Captured in Tibet, p. 23. Commander-in-chief of the 1959 uprising Lhalu returned to Lhasa in July 1951. After Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China, the Tibetan government was reorganised. He was dismissed from government service in May 1952 (on account of his maladministration of Kham during his tenure as Governor) but was allowed to retain his rank. In 1955, he headed a delegation to Beijing and met Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.Jiawei Wang, Nimajianzan, The historical status of China's Tibet, China Hanban donation, ‰∫îÊ¥≤‰º†Êí≠Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 1997, 333 p. , , p. 280. In 1957, he was appointed ¬´ governor of the grain supply ¬ª.Anna Louise Strong, When Serfs Stood Up, New World Press, Beijing, 1960, chap. VIII Lhalu's Serfs Accuse: \\"He continued to hold high post in Tibet's local government (..) and was governor of grain supply in 1957.\\" According to American journalist and Marxist writer Anna Louise Strong, unlike some of the sincere signers of the 17-point agreement, Lhalu continued plotting for Tibet's secession from China.Cf Anna Louise Strong, When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet, op. cit., chap. VIII Lhalu's Serfs Accuse: \\"Some of the signers of the Agreement took it sincerely; Lhalu did not. (..) His plotting for Tibet's secession from China continued; it had a history of years.\\" In 1959, he participated in the Tibetan uprising, and would later describe himself as having been the commander-in-chief of the rebel forces.Anna Louise Strong, When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet, op. cit., chap. VIII Lhalu's Serfs Accuse: \\"Lhalu Tsewong-Dorje, commander-in-chief of the March rebellion in Lhasa.\\" He was captured, subjected to struggle sessions (known in Tibetan as thamzing), and imprisoned in Drapchi Prison.Palden Gyatso, Le feu sous la neige: \\"Drapchi housed some of Tibet's most famous prisoners and dissidents. The prison was divided into five different brigades, or ruka. The fifth ruka housed all the former Tibetan government officials and high lamas, including Lobsang Tashi, the last prime minister of Tibet, and Lhalu, the former commander of the Tibetan army in eastern Tibet.\\" At a mass meeting of ten thousand people in Lhasa circa 1959, he was implicated in the murders of former Regent Reting and tulku Geda, both supposedly sympathetic to the Chinese.Cf Anna Louise Strong, When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet, op. cit., chap. VIII Lhalu's Serfs Accuse: \\"Recent accusations made before a mass meeting of ten thousand people in Lhasa had implicated him in the murder of Rabchen, the Dalai Lama's first regent, and of the progressive Living Buddha Geda, both of whom opposed secession and had been killed for this not long before the liberation. Evidence of Lhalu's participation had been filed with the courts and would be considered later.\\" He narrowly escaped being beaten up thanks to the protection of PLA soldiers.Jiawei Wang, Nyima Gyaincain, The historical status of China's Tibet, op. cit., p. 280: \\"how the PLA soldiers protected him from being beaten at the mass rally.\\" Anna Louise Strong's testimony In 1959, Anna Louise Strong was allowed to travel to Tibet to report on the political situation there. In a book published the following year, When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet, she described a hearing on Lhalu's treatment of his local serfs organized by the Fourth Inhabitants' Committee of the Western District of Lhasa. Lhalu, then 43 years old, was to reply to the accusations levelled at him by former serfs and slaves from one of his 24 manorial estates: mistreatment, non respect of his peasants and servants' rights, imprisonment in the manor's jail. Lhalu is forced to admit that he had been \\"too harsh\\", had \\"a touchy temper\\", had \\"made mistakes\\" or \\"gone to excess\\". The accusation meeting ends with the burning of his titles of debts (All \\"feudal debts\\" had been outlawed by the resolution passed July 17 by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region).Anna Louise Strong, When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet, op. cit. chap. VII Lhalu's Serfs Accuse : \\"The accusation meeting (...) was a local affair, a hearing on Lhalu's treatment of his local serfs. It was being held under the Fourth Inhabitants' Committee of the Western District of Lhasa. (...) It was clear that Lhalu, like other serf- owners, had a large number of nantsam, and that those who were house and stable slaves, being in frequent contact with their master, were quickly detected in misdemeanors and at once flogged, and sometimes also cast for periods of various lengths into the 'private jail' which all manorial estates maintained in their cellars. (...) At times some response was forced from Lhalu. On some charges he admitted that he had been 'too harsh', had 'a touchy temper', had 'made mistakes' or 'gone to excess'. (..) Suddenly a loud shout rose like a war cry from the audience: 'Burn the debts! Burn the debts!' (...) Lhalu's steward was bringing in the 'titles of debts'. (...) All 'feudal debts' had been outlawed by the resolution passed July 17 by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. (...) Matches were put to the pile (...) [Lhalu] gazed without expression at the fire which was burning away the documents of his feudal power. Then a few of the guards came to take him away. He went without handcuffs.\\" Political rehabilitation After he was set free on special amnesty in 1965, Lhalu took up farming.Jiawei Wang, Nimajianzan, The historical status of China's Tibet, op. cit., p. 280.

He said in an interview, \\"I have become disappointed with the Dalai Lama,\\" and \\"[h]e does not behave like a reincarnated living Buddha but is a stooge of the Westerners.\\" According to English writer Patrick French, in 1999 he took his distance from the official rhetoric, indicating that he was missing his former friends and that he wished the return of the Dalai Lama: \\"There is a Tibetan saying: 'Old bird misses forests and old people miss hometown'. I sincerely wish the Fourteenth Dalai Lama will return, in the interests of the motherland, at an early date and join us in socialist construction.\\"Patrick French, Tibet, Tibet: a personal history of a lost land, p. 178.

Armed conflict between Tibetan guerillas and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had started in 1956 in the Kham and Amdo regions, which had been subjected to socialist reform. The guerrilla warfare later spread to other areas of Tibet and lasted through 1962. Some regard the Xunhua Incident in 1958 as a precursor of the Tibetan uprising. The anniversary of the uprising is observed by Tibetan exiles as the Tibetan Uprising Day and Women's Uprising Day. The anniversary of its end is officially celebrated in the Tibetan Autonomous Region as Serfs Emancipation Day.  Armed resistance in east Tibet  In 1951, an agreement between the People's Republic of China and representatives of the Dalai Lama was put into effect. Socialist reforms such as redistribution of land were delayed in Tibet proper. However, eastern Kham and Amdo (western Sichuan and Qinghai provinces in the Chinese administrative hierarchy) were outside the administration of the Tibetan government in Lhasa, and were thus treated more like other Chinese provinces, with land redistribution implemented in full. The Khampas and nomads of Amdo traditionally owned their own land. Armed resistance broke out in Amdo and eastern Kham in June 1956. Prior to the PLA invasion, relations between Lhasa and the Khampa chieftains had deteriorated, although the Khampa remained spiritually loyal to the Dalai Lama throughout. Because of these strained relations, the Khampa had actually assisted the Chinese in their initial invasion, before becoming the guerrilla resistance they are now known for. Pandatsang Rapga, a pro Kuomintang and pro Republic of China revolutionary Khampa leader, offered the governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, some Khampa fighters in exchange for the Tibetan government recognizing the independence of Kham. Ngabo refused the offer. After the defeat of the Tibetan Army in Chamdo, Rapga started mediating in negotiations between the PLA and Tibetan rebels. Rapga and Topgay engaged in negotiations with the Chinese during their assault on Chamdo. Khampas either defected to the Chinese PLA forces or did not fight at all. The PLA succeeded in the task. By 1957, Kham was in chaos. Resistance fighters' attacks and People's Liberation Army reprisals against Khampa resistance fighters such as the Chushi Gangdruk became increasingly brutal. Kham's monastic networks came to be used by guerilla forces to relay messages and hide rebels. Punitive strikes were carried out by the Chinese government against Tibetan villages and monasteries. Tibetan exiles assert that threats to bomb the Potala Palace and the Dalai Lama were made by Chinese military commanders in an attempt to intimidate the guerrilla forces into submission. Lhasa continued to abide by the seventeen point agreement and sent a delegation to Kham to quell the rebellion. After speaking with the rebel leaders, the delegation instead joined the rebellion. Kham leaders contacted the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), but the CIA under President Dwight D. Eisenhower insisted it required an official request from Lhasa to support the rebels. Lhasa did not act. Eventually the CIA began to provide covert support for the rebellion without word from Lhasa. By then the rebellion had spread to Lhasa which had filled with refugees from Amdo and Kham. Opposition to the Chinese presence in Tibet grew within the city of Lhasa. In mid-February 1959 the CCP Central Committee's Administrative Office circulated the Xinhua News Agency internal report on how \\"the revolts in the Tibetan region have gathered pace and developed into a nearly full-scale rebellion.\\" in a \\"situation report\\" for top CCP leaders.page 69 The next day, the Chinese leader saw a report from the PLA General Staff‚Äôs Operations Department describing rebellions by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai. He again stressed that \\"rebellions like these are extremely favorable for us because they will benefit us in helping to train our troops, train the people, and provide a sufficient reason to crush the rebellion and carry out comprehensive reforms in the future.\\" The PLA used Hui soldiers, who formerly had served under Ma Bufang to crush the Tibetan revolt in Amdo. In Southern Kham, Hui cavalry were stationed.  Lhasa Rebellion  The 14th Dalai Lama in 1956 On 1 March 1959, as a traditional event, a theatrical performance at the Chinese military headquarters outside Lhasa invited officials to attend. According to a Communist source contradicting the 14th Dalai Lama's account, the Dalai Lama suggested proactively that he would like to attend. The Dalai Lama‚Äîat the time studying for his lharampa geshe degree‚Äîinitially postponed the meeting, but he eventually set for 10 March. On 9 March 3pm, Chinese army officer told Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme that the Dalai Lama decided to attend the performance and other Tibetan officials could go directly as instructed by the Dalai Lama. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme found this was counter the tradition, but confirmed this from Tibetan official at 6pm-7pm and was involved to arrange the matter and talked to the chief officer. According to historian Tsering Shakya, the Chinese government was pressuring the Dalai Lama to attend the National People's Congress in April 1959, in order to repair China's image in relation to ethnic minorities after the Khampa rebellion. On 7 February 1959, a significant day on the Tibetan calendar, the Dalai Lama attended a religious dance, after which the acting representative in Tibet, Tan Guansan, offered the Dalai Lama a chance to see a performance from a dance troupe native to Lhasa at the Norbulingka to celebrate the Dalai Lama's completion of his lharampa geshe degree. According to Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, the Dalai Lama proactively asked to attend the performance. According to the Dalai Lama's memoirs, the invitation came from Chinese General Chiang Chin-wu, who proposed that the performance be held at the Chinese military headquarters; the Dalai Lama states that he agreed.Dalai Lama's (1990) Freedom in Exile states that \\"General Chiang Chin- wu... announced... a new dance troupe... Might I be interested to see them? I replied that I would be. He then said that they could perform anywhere, but since there was a proper stage with footlights at the Chinese military headquarters, it might be better if I could go there. This made sense as there were no such facilities at the Norbulingka, so I indicated that I would be happy to do so\\" (p. 130) The planned performance date of 10 March was only finalized 5 days beforehand, on 5 March. Neither the Kashag nor the Dalai Lama's bodyguards were informed of the Dalai Lama's plans until Chinese officials briefed them on 9 March, one day before the performance was scheduled, and insisted that they would handle the Dalai Lama's security. The Dalai Lama's memoirs state that on 9 March the Chinese told his chief bodyguard that they wanted the Dalai Lama's excursion to watch the production conducted \\"in absolute secrecy\\" and without any armed Tibetan bodyguards, which \\"all seemed strange requests and there was much discussion\\" amongst the Dalai Lama's advisors. Some members of the Kashag were alarmed and concerned that the Dalai Lama might be abducted, recalling a prophecy that told that the Dalai Lama should not exit his palace. According to historian Tsering Shakya, some Tibetan government officials feared that plans were being laid for a Chinese abduction of the Dalai Lama, and spread word to that effect amongst the inhabitants of Lhasa.

The huge crowd had gathered in response to a rumor that the Chinese were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama when he went to a cultural performance at the PLA's headquarters.page 71 This marked the beginning of the uprising in Lhasa, though Chinese forces had skirmished with guerrillas outside the city in December of the previous year. Although CCP officials insisted that the \\"reactionary upper stratum\\" in Lhasa was responsible for the rumor, there is no way to identify the precise source.page 72 At first, the violence was directed at Tibetan officials perceived not to have protected the Dalai Lama or to be pro-Chinese; attacks on Chinese started later. One of the first casualties of mob was a senior lama, Pagbalha Soinam Gyamco, who worked with the PRC as a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, who was killed and his body dragged by a horse in front of the crowd for .Dalai clique's masterminding of Lhasa violence exposed. 30 March 2008.

Barricades went up on the streets of Lhasa, and Chinese and Tibetan rebel forces began to fortify positions within and around Lhasa in preparation for conflict. A petition of support for the armed rebels outside the city was taken up, and an appeal for assistance was made to the Indian consul. Chinese and Tibetan troops continued moving into position over the next several days, with Chinese artillery pieces being deployed within range of the Dalai Lama's summer palace, the Norbulingka. 17 March 1959: Thousands of Tibetan women surround the Potala Palace, the main residence of the Dalai Lama, to protest against Chinese rule and repression in Lhasa, Tibet. Hours later, fighting broke out and the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to safety in India. Photograph: AP On March 12 thousands of women gathered in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa on the ground called Dri-bu-Yul-Khai Thang. The leader of this nonviolent demonstration was Pamo Kusang. This demonstration, now known as Women's Uprising Day, started the Tibetan women's movement for independence. On March 14 at the same location thousands of women assembled in a protest led by \\"Gurteng Kunsang, a member of the aristocratic Kundeling family and mother of six who was later arrested by the Chinese and executed by firing squad.\\" On 15 March, preparations for the Dalai Lama's evacuation from the city were set in motion, with Tibetan troops being employed to secure an escape route from Lhasa. On 17 March, two artillery shells landed near the Dalai Lama's palace, triggering his flight into exile. The Dalai Lama secretly left the palace the following night and slipped out of Lhasa with his family and a small number of officials. The Chinese had not strongly guarded the Potala, as they did not believe it likely that the Dalai Lama would try to flee. The Jokhang, on whose roof the last Tibetan rebels had placed machine guns to defend themselves against the PLA Rumours about the Dalai Lama's disappearance began to spread rapidly on the next day, though most still believed that he was in the palace. Meanwhile, the situation in the city became increasingly tense, as protestors had seized a number of machine guns. On 20 March, the Chinese army responded by shelling the Norbulingka to disperse the crowd, and placed its troops at a barricade that divided the city into a northern and southern part in the following night. The battle began early on the following day, and even though the Tibetan rebels were outnumbered and poorly armed,Chushi Gangdruk the street fighting proved to be \\"bloody\\". The last Tibetan resistance was centered on the Jokhang, where Khampa refugees had set up machine guns, while a large number of Tibetans circumambulated the temple in reverence. The PLA started to attack the Jokhang on 23 March, and a hard-fought, three hours-long battle with many casualties on both sides ensued. The Chinese eventually managed to break through using a tank, whereupon they raised the flag of China on the temple, ending the uprising. Two British writers, Stuart and Roma Gelder, visited the Chensel Phodrang palace in the Norbulingka in 1962 and \\"found its contents meticulously preserved\\".Stuart and Roma Gelder, Timely Rain: Travels in New Tibet, in Monthly Review Press, New York, 1964, facing p. 160 : \\"He [the dalai-lama] was told this building with other palaces in the Jewel Park was reduced to ruin by Chinese gunfire soon after he left. We found its contents meticulously preserved.\\"  Republic of China's involvement and its position on Tibetan independence  Pandatsang Rapga, a pro-Kuomintang and pro-Republic of China revolutionary Khampa leader, was instrumental in the revolt against the Communists. The Kuomintang had a history of using Khampa fighters to oppose both the Dalai Lama's Tibetan government, and battle the Communist Red Army. Rapga continued to cooperate with the ROC Kuomintang government after it fled to Taiwan; they provided training to Khampa rebels against the Communist PLA forces. The Republic of China on Taiwan disputed with America whether Tibet would be independent, since the ROC claimed Tibet as part of its territory. Rapga agreed to a plan in which the revolt against the Communists would include anti feudalism, land reform, a modern government, and to give power to the people. The Republic of China continued to claim Tibet as an integral part of its territory in accordance with its constitution, contrary to the claims of the Dalai Lama's Central Tibetan Administration which claimed Tibetan independence. After the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, Chiang Kai-shek announced in his Letter to Tibetan Friends () that the ROC's policy would be to help the Tibetan diaspora overthrow the People's Republic of China's rule in Tibet. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission sent secret agents to India to disseminate pro-Kuomintang (KMT) and anti-Communist propaganda among Tibetan exiles. From 1971 to 1978, the MTAC also recruited ethnic Tibetan children from India and Nepal to study in Taiwan, with the expectation that they would work for a ROC government that returned to the mainland. In 1994, the veterans' association for the Tibetan guerrilla group Chushi Gangdruk met with the MTAC and agreed to the KMT's One China Principle. In response, the Dalai Lama's Central Tibetan Administration forbade all exiled Tibetans from contact with the MTAC. Tibetans in Taiwan, who are mostly of Kham origin, support the Republic of China's position that Tibet is part of the ROC, and are against both the Tibetan exile community in India who live under the Tibetan Government in Exile (TGE) and the Communists in mainland China. The Taiwanese Tibetans are considered traitors by the TGE for their position.  Casualties  Colin Mackerras states, \\"There was a major rebellion against Chinese rule in Tibet in March 1959, which was put down with the cost of much bloodshed and lasting bitterness on the part of the Tibetans.\\" The Tibetan government-in-exile reports variously, 85,000, 86,000, and 87,000 deaths for Tibetans during the rebellion, attributed to \\"secret Chinese documents captured by guerrillas\\".Official Website of the Tibetan Government in Exile. History Leading up to March 10th 1959. 7 September 1998. Retrieved March 16, 2008. Tibetologist Tom Grunfeld said \\"the veracity of such a claim is difficult to verify.\\" Warren W. Smith, a writer with Radio Free Asia, writes that the \\"secret documents\\" came from a 1960 PLA report captured by guerrillas in 1966, with the figures first published by the TGIE in India in 1990. Smith states that the documents said that 87,000 \\"enemies were eliminated\\", but he does not take \\"eliminated\\" to mean \\"killed\\", as the TGIE does. A Tibetan Government in Exile (TGIE) official surnamed Samdup released a report for Asia Watch after three fact-finding missions from 1979 to 1981, stating that a speech by premier Zhou Enlai, published in Beijing Review in 1980, confirmed the 87,000 figure. Demographer Yan Hao could find no reference to any such figure in the published speech, and concluded, \\"If these TGIE sources are not reluctant to fabricate Chinese sources in open publications, how can they expect people to believe in their citations of so-called Chinese secret internal documents and speeches that are never available in originals to independent researchers?\\"  Aftermath  Lhasa's three major monasteries‚ÄîSera, Ganden, and Drepung‚Äîwere seriously damaged by shelling, with Sera and Drepung being damaged nearly beyond repair. According to the TGIE, Members of the Dalai Lama's bodyguard remaining in Lhasa were disarmed and publicly executed, along with Tibetans found to be harbouring weapons in their homes. Thousands of Tibetan monks were executed or arrested, and monasteries and temples around the city were looted or destroyed. After the March 12 Women's Uprising demonstration, many of the women involved were imprisoned, including the leader of the demonstration, Pamo Kusang. \\"Some of them were tortured, died in prison, or were executed.\\" Known as Women's Uprising Day, this demonstration started the Tibetan women's movement for independence. The CIA officer, Bruce Walker, who oversaw the operations of CIA-trained Tibetan agents, was troubled by the hostility from the Tibetans towards his agents: \\"the radio teams were experiencing major resistance from the population inside Tibet.\\" The CIA trained Tibetans from 1957 to 1972, in the United States, and parachuted them back into Tibet to organise rebellions against the PLA. In one incident, one agent was immediately reported by his own brother and all three agents in the team were arrested. They were not mistreated. After less than a month of propaganda sessions, they were escorted to the Indian border and released. In April 1959, the 19-year-old Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, the second ranking spiritual leader in Tibet, residing in Shigatse, called on Tibetans to support the Chinese government.Feigon 1996, pg. 163 However, after a tour through Tibet, he wrote a document in May 1962 known as the 70,000 Character Petition addressed to Zhou Enlai criticizing Chinese abuses in Tibet, and met with Zhou to discuss it. The outlined petition dealt with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan people both during and after the PRC's invasion of TibetThe 10th Panchen Lama and the sufferings of the people in The Great Leap Forward. In this document, he criticized the suppression that the Chinese authorities had conducted in retaliation for the 1959 Tibetan uprising.Hostage of Beijing: The Abduction of the Panchen Lama, Gilles Van Grasdorff, 1999, :fr:P√©tition en 70 000 caract√®res But in October 1962, the PRC authorities dealing with the population criticized the petition. Chairman Mao called the petition \\"... a poisoned arrow shot at the Party by reactionary feudal overlords.\\" In 1967 the Panchen Lama was formally arrested and imprisoned until his release in 1977.International Campaign for Tibet, Buddhist monk Palden Gyatso was arrested in June, 1959 by Chinese officials for demonstrating during the March uprising. He spent the following 33 years in Chinese prisons and laogai or \\"reform through labor\\" camps, the longest term of any Tibetan political prisoner.Rosenthal, A. M. On My Mind; You Are Palden Gyatso, The New York Times, April 11, 1995 \\"He was forced to participate in barbarous re-education classes and He was tortured by various methods, which included being beaten with a club ridden with nails, shocked by an electric probe, which scarred his tongue and caused his teeth to fall out, whipped while being forced to pull an iron plow, and starved.\\" leading to irreversible physical damage. Released in 1992, he escaped to Dharamsala in India, home of the Tibetan government in exile and became an internationally acclaimed activist for the Tibetan cause. Chinese authorities have interpreted the uprising as a revolt of the Tibetan elite against Communist reforms that were improving the lot of Tibetan serfs. Tibetan and third party sources, on the other hand, have usually interpreted it as a popular uprising against the alien Chinese presence. Historian Tsering Shakya has argued that it was a popular revolt against both the Chinese and the Lhasa government, which was perceived as failing to protect the authority and safety of the Dalai Lama from the Chinese.

The book is a compilation of many of the articles Fisk wrote when he was serving as a correspondent in the Middle East for The Times and The Independent. The book revolves around several key themes regarding the history of the modern Middle East: the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf War as well as the 2003 Iraq War (United States invasion of Iraq) as well as other regional conflicts such as the Armenian Genocide and the Algerian Civil War. The Great War for Civilisation is the second book Fisk has written about the Middle East with the first one, Pity the Nation, (Nation Books, 2002) being about the Lebanese Civil War. Fisk's book details his travels to many of the hotspots of the Middle East, such as Iraq and Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and his numerous interviews with both the country's leaders and its people. Along with these interviews, Fisk also provides much of the historical context to these conflicts. In the book, Fisk criticizes the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom for what he perceives as their hypocritical and biased foreign policy towards the Middle East, especially in regard to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict and the 2003 Iraq War. He contends leaders of both countries deliberately misled the world about their motivations for invading Iraq in 2003.See, for example, Chapter 22 (pp. 888‚Äì937) which deals with the run up to the invasion and its aftermath. The name of the book comes from a campaign medal Fisk's father was awarded for his services in the First World War.Fisk, Robert (2006). The Great War For Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East. New York: Alfred Knopf, xvii. Contents The first two chapters of the book focus on Fisk's first hand accounts of the first year of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Above, Soviet Spetsnaz prepare for a military operation. 1\\\\. \\"One of Our Brothers Had a Dream...\\" is about Fisk's first interview in 1996 with the leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden in the mountains of Afghanistan. The title of the chapter is derived from bin Laden who explains that one of his fighters had a dream of Fisk, wearing a robe and with a beard, and who was approaching them on a horse, signifying that he was, according to bin Laden, a \\"true Muslim\\".Fisk. Great War For Civilisation, 29. Fisk immediately understood the context of the dream as an attempt by bin Laden to recruit him into his organization.Fisk. Great War for Civilisation, 29‚Äì30. 2\\\\. They Shoot Russians is on the 1980 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan where Fisk chronicles much of the problems the Soviet Union faced in dealing with the Afghan mujahideen when they entered the country as well as the invasion's galvanizing effect in recruiting thousands of foreign Muslim fighters to the country and the resurgence of Islamic extremism in the country. 3\\\\. The Choirs of Kandahar is essentially a continuation of Chapter 2. 4\\\\. The Carpet-Weavers begins with the CIA and MI6's successful overthrow of the democratically elected prime minister of Iran, Mohammed Mosaddeq. From there, it moves on to the events leading up to and following the Iranian Revolution of 1979 which deposed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. An Iranian soldier wearing a gas mask during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. 5‚Äì8. The Path to War and the subsequent chapters The Whirlwind War, War Against War and the Fast Train to Paradise and Drinking the Poisoned Chalice deal with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the battles of the Iran-Iraq of the 1980s including the Tanker War, Iran's use of human wave tactics and Saddam's use of chemical weapons against Iran, the United States' and West's roles in the conflict and the conclusion of the war. 9\\\\. Sentenced to Suffer Death is Fisk's account of his father, Bill Fisk, during his service in the British military in World War I and his difficult decision to refuse to take part as a member of a firing squad ordered to execute another soldier. 10\\\\. The First Holocaust is devoted to the topic of the Armenian Genocide. Its title is derived from the fact that the Genocide, organized by the government of the Ottoman Empire, took place in 1915, several decades before the Jewish Holocaust. In it, Fisk provides the historical context of the Armenian Genocide and includes his numerous interviews with survivors of the Genocide who are then living in Lebanon and Armenia. Fisk also heavily criticizes the denialist stance of Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, as well as Israel and Great Britain for failing to recognize the massacres and deportations as genocide. 11‚Äì13. Fifty Thousand Miles from Palestine and the subsequent chapters The Last Colonial War and The Girl and the Child and Love are devoted to the Arab-Israeli conflict from the 1980s onward. The chapters deal with the deaths of civilians on both sides, suicide bombings and the Israeli government's military approach to the Palestinian issue. Much of these chapters also detail with media coverage of the conflict and the terms used by them to describe both sides, most notably the word \\"terrorist\\". 14\\\\. Anything to Wipe Out a Devil... briefly focuses on the Algerian War and the use of torture and terrorism by both the French military and Algerian fighters of the 1954‚Äì1962 war. After the French pullout and Algerian independence, the book details the internal power struggles among the secular and Islamist factions and continues on with this theme into the Algerian Civil War which began in 1991. 15\\\\. Planet Damnation gives an eyewitness report of the Gulf War. Fisk was stationed in the desert with the Allied forces and makes references both to the push-back of Iraqis from Kuwait and to the bombing of Iraq in connection with it. 16\\\\. Betrayal describes the repression of the Iraqi uprising after the Gulf War by the Iraqi government, which attacked and persecuted the rebels, as well as the Kurdish northern minority. 17\\\\. The Land of Graves. The pun in the chapter's title points at the repercussions that U.N.'s sanctions against Iraq had on the civilian population. 18\\\\. The Plague deals with the unusual illnesses which plagued the Iraqi public after the war. 19\\\\. Now Thrive the Armourers... is an incursion into the world of the arms manufacturers of \\"all nationalities, all faiths, all follies, all causes and all crimes,\\"George Bernard Shaw, Major Barbara, Act III. The quote constitutes the epigraph of the chapter. which provide belligerents with weapons. 20\\\\. Even to Kings, He Comes... is an analysis of the deeds of King Hussein of Jordan and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. The first, a controversial ruler, whose subjects were both acclaiming him and shrieking at his coffin during his burial ceremony, is put alongside \\"The Lion of Damascus\\", whose Hama massacre is looked into. 21\\\\. Why ? tries to find an explanation to the September 11, 2001, attacks. From a strict journalistic point of view, the tragedy came totally unwelcome for Fisk, as it postponed indefinitely his coverage of the Sabra and Chatila massacres out of the pages of The Independent. Fisk inserts the skipped report in the first part of Chapter 21. 22\\\\. The Die Is Cast examines the diplomatic and mass media moves which led to Operation Iraqi Freedom. 23\\\\. Atomic Dog, Annihilator, Arsonist, Anthrax, Anguish and Agamemnon describes in great detail the turbulences which have accompanied the takeover of Iraq and its capital, Baghdad. 24\\\\. Into the Wilderness is the last chapter of the book. It gives an idea of the challenges the Coalition Provisional Authority has faced in that country, and reports on the assassination of the Lebanese Prime- Minister Rafiq Hariri, witnessed by Fisk. The book ends, as it has begun, in the \\"tiny village of Louvencourt, on the Somme,\\" where Robert Fisk's father has fought. This is not only meant as a homage to Bill Fisk, but is also an implicit reminder of one of the leitmotifs of the book: the volatile situation in the Middle East is a consequence of the political arrangements concluded at the end of the First World War. The work has also a Chronology of the Middle East, starting with the birth of the Prophet Mohammed and ending in 2005, the year of the book's British release, with the words: \\"UN Security Council Resolution 242 of 1968 ‚Äì calling for Israel's withdrawal from occupied land ‚Äì remains unfulfilled.\\" Reviews The Guardian published a review of the book by retired British Ambassador Oliver Miles where numerous mistakes were pointed out, such as regarding the Ba'ath party and Iraq's revolutions, the Balfour declaration, locations of US bases, claiming the Hijazi Hashemites were Gulf people, wrongly assigning an Umayyad character to Baghdad, the century of Ali bin Abi Talib's death, and mistakes in the meaning of Arabic, Persian, Russian, and French words and the birthplace of Jesus.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/19/highereducation.news Footnotes References * Fisk, Robert (2007): The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East, Vintage, , , 1136 pages.

Armstrong Utilities, Inc. ranks among the 15 largest multi-system operators in the United States. History Armstrong began in 1946 and was originally called Armstrong County Line Construction. Founded by Jud L. Sedwick, the company was headquartered in Kittanning, Armstrong County, in Pennsylvania. Together with his brother Ned, Sedwick ran two crews consisting of six men each, whose job consisted of hanging telephone lines, setting telephone poles, and clearing right of way throughout western Pennsylvania, and managed to grow the company to 12 crews by the end of their first year of operations. Today Armstrong is in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New York, West Virginia, and Kentucky for its digital cable services, most commonly providing television, telephone and high-speed Internet service. Currently, Armstrong employs over 2,300 people. The company's headquarters are in Butler County, western Pennsylvania, with local offices scattered throughout the region. Services offered Armstrong Cable In 1963, the first cable television customers of Armstrong were connected in Butler, Pennsylvania. These customers were provided with nine viewing channels. For the next 40+ years Armstrong continued to grow in western Pennsylvania and the surrounding states virtually uncontested for television service until the expansion of satellite service became more widespread. With the increase in competitors, new services emerged. Armstrong cable now offers personal video recorders (PVR), video on demand service (VOD), pay-per-view service (PPV), as well as high-definition digital programming. Armstrong Zoom Internet Armstrong also offers broadband internet service for residential and commercial customers. From 2013 to 2017, Armstrong instituted a 200GB monthly data cap. In March 2017, this was raised to 400GB. Consumers can pay more to increase the data cap. If the customer goes over the cap, they are not throttled nor shut off but instead pay an additional $10 for every 50GB they go over. As of March 2018 that data capwas raised to 1024GB(1TB) with the Zoom level of service, but the Zoom 2 and above levels have a 2048GB(2TB) data cap. Armstrong Cable Telephone Armstrong offers a cable telephone service that can be bundled with either the video or internet product, or as a stand-alone product.

It has no transparent meaning in modern Finnish, but is likely to have been derived from the mostly archaic word 'korho'. In some dialects, this word is used to mean a person of poor hearing or a numb-witted person. On the other hand, professor Alfred Salmela suggested in 1970 that the word 'korho' is a loan from the Baltic languages and has meant \\"old, village elder or chief\\". It still reported to carry a meaning of \\"proud, rich and boastful\\" in the southern parts of Finnish Lapland. In addition, in languages closely related to Finnish such as Karelian, Estonian and Ludic the word 'korho' has the meaning \\"raised or upright\\". As an example of a word derived from this, the Karelian verb 'korhottaa' means \\"to be or move upright, to have one's head up high, to raise, to shake threateningly or brandish and to listen attentively\\". There are similar examples from Finnish dialects such as 'korhop√§√§' from P√∂yty√§ meaning roughly \\"one with a head of hair standing on end\\" and 'korholaiho' recorded from Ylistaro meaning \\"a crop growing upright\\". Also, in modern (both formal and colloquial) Finnish 'korottaa' means \\"to raise\\". The name originates from Eastern Finland and is much older than its closest competitor for the title of the most common Finnish surname, Virtanen.

Due to its light weight it was also called Air Baby. Design and development The Praga E.114, first flown in 1934 and designed by Jaroslav ≈†lechta, was a high wing, cantilever monoplane seating two in a side-by-side cabin. It was an all wood aircraft with a two spar single piece wing; the spars and ribs were built from pine and plywood and the wing plywood covered. The wing section was reflexed at the trailing edge. The wing had a constant chord centre section with taper on the trailing edge outboard and rounded tips. The ailerons were plywood covered and unbalanced. Its fuselage was a pine framed, plywood covered hexagonal box, with the straight edged fin an integral part. The rudder was rounded and horn balanced. Though the rudder was wood framed and covered, the tailplane, mounted just above the fuselage and externally braced from below, had a tube steel structure and was fabric covered. The elevators were balanced by an elastic rope to the control column. Early in the design process the E.114 had been envisaged as an open cockpit aircraft but by the time of construction there was an enclosed cabin. The first prototype had rather crude glazing constructed from plane panes. The absence of doors made entry somewhat challenging, with the side panels hinged down and the upper pane, together with part of the wing leading edge hinged upwards. The second prototype added a lower fuselage foothold to ease the process, as well as fitting less angular glazing. The undercarriage, which was also used as a first step into the cabin, was of the divided type with faired legs hinged on the lower fuselage, assisted by struts from the centre line to the wheels. The wheels contained rubber shock absorbers and were optionally spatted Early aircraft were powered by a 29 kW (36 hp) Aeronca E-113 air-cooled, boxer two-cylinder engine mounted in the extreme nose with its cylinders exposed. Early production aircraft replaced the US-built Aeronca with a very similar Czechoslovakian engine, also built by Praga, called the Praga B. Later the similar but more powerful Praga B2 was fitted and from 1936 this was replaced in turn by the four-cylinder Praga D producing 49/55 kW (65/74 hp), with each pair of exposed cylinders merged into a single housing for lower drag. Aircraft with this engine were referred to as E.114D. As well as benefiting from more power, the E.114D had other enhancements. The ailerons were balanced, improving the stall characteristics; the vertical surfaces were increased in area and given a more angular profile with a non-balanced rudder. The last E.114 variant involving an engine change was the E.114M, fitted with a 49 kW (65 hp) Walter Mikron III four-cylinder inverted inline engine. The full cowling changed the look of the nose considerably and increased the length by 510 mm (20 in). The E.114M was the heaviest of the series, with an empty weight of 415 kg (915 lb); the E.114D weighed 330 kg (728 lb). The wing carried noticeable dihedral and the E.114M was the only one of its type to have a tailwheel rather than a skid. It was the fastest of the type, with a maximum speed of 185 km/h (115 mph). The E.115 appeared in 1937 with significant changes to the wing. The span was only slightly reduced (by 200 mm or 7.9 in) but continuous taper reduced the area by 20%. The ailerons were fabric covered. It could be powered by either the Praga B or D and was noticeably faster than earlier variants, even with the smaller engine. The E.115 also had a revised undercarriage, with single, streamlined steel struts hinged to the lower fuselage braced by rods to the centre section. The wheels were spatted and the legs sprung with bungee cord inside the fuselage. The E.117 of 1937 had major alterations. The wing was the same span as that of the E.114 but was given a straight taper, resulting in a small (3.3%) decrease in area. For the first time flaps (of the split type) were fitted. The wing remained wooden but a steel framed, fabric covered fuselage was used and the fin and elevator were similarly constructed. The new fuselage construction allowed the E.117 to have cabin doors for the first time, as well as a more generous interior. It had cantilever undercarriage legs, with wheels in fairings and a tailwheel in place of the skid used by most of the E.114s and E.115, though one of the only two E.117s built flew for a time with a tricycle undercarriage, its mainlegs moved rearwards and with a faired nosewheel assembly. The E.214, which appeared in about 1936 or 1937 was essentially an E.114 with a 56 kW (75 hp) Pobjoy R seven-cylinder radial engine. The structure was the same as that of the E.114 and the wings had the same dimensions. With a length of 7.15 m (23 ft 5¬Ω in), the E.214 was a few millimetres longer than the E.114M, despite the latter's much longer engine and the extension provided space for a second pair of seats behind the first, making the E.214 a four-seater. The new seats were accessed via a side door, though the front pair retained the side window route of the earlier aircraft. A trim tab on the elevator replaced the elastic rope balance and the undercarriage was also new, each side having an oleo leg fixed to the lower fuselage longeron and braced at its lower end by a V-form strut, hinged on the fuselage centreline. At 420 kg (926 lb), its empty weight was close to that of the E.114M. Maximum speed was 170 km/h (106 mph). Operational history The first Air Baby prototype flew for the first time in September 1934 and appeared at the Czech National Flying Club Competition. After several demonstration flights within Europe it was displayed at the 1934 Paris salon. The Praga was produced before World War II both by ƒåKD-Praga in Prague and, under licence as the Hillson Praga, by F. Hills & Sons Ltd of Manchester in the UK. Approximately 150 E.114B models were built, including roughly 40 of the Hillson variant.http://forum.valka.cz/topic/view/8827 Collective production of E.114 D, E and M versions was around 125.http://forum.valka.cz/topic/view/8828 In 1938 the E.115, then powered by a Praga B engine, set a class speed record at 171.5 km/h (106.6 mph) over a 100 km (62 mi) course. In May 1936 one was flown from the UK to South Africa in a new record time of 16 days and 4.5 hours. No South African sales followed and this aircraft was later converted into a glider. Two E.114s participated in the Sternflug to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The two E.114 pilots, Fuksa and Polma, took the first two places ahead of competitors, equipped with aircraft with more powerful engines. Before the war some Czech built E.114s were exported to other European countries including Italy and Romania. The first Manchester-built Hillson Praga was exported to Australia. Demand for the type in the UK was subdued and over half went to flying clubs, including a batch of ten to the Northern Aviation School & Club (NAS&C;), set up at Barton Aerodrome near Manchester by the manufacturers for this purpose.Ord-Hume 2000. p.389 The NAS&C; also trained prospective pilots of the Civil Air Guard. The Praga B engines manufactured in the UK by Jowett Cars Ltd proved unreliable and at least five were replaced by the much heavier 30 kW (40 hp) Aeronca JAP J-99 flat twin. A Hillson Praga won the Manx Air Derby, flying three circuits of the Isle of Man on 1 June 1936 at 144 km/h (89.5 mph). British-built Hillson Praga active in 1952 Post-war Czech built E.114Ms were exported to France, Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Romania and the Saarland. Used as tourers and trainers, they also acted as glider tugs. Five Hillsons survived the war but only two flew again. One crashed in Turkey in 1946 and the other, G-AEUT (photo) crashed in Italy in 1957.Jackson 1988 As of 2017, there are two active flying Praga Air Baby in existence: * HB-UAF, the aircraft is powered by a Walter Mikron III engine.http://www.bazl.admin.ch/experten/luftfahrzeuge/luftfahrzeugregister/index.html?lfrSucheTs=1421347339‚ü®=en&nummer;=UAF&muster;=Praga&lfz;=&eigentuemer;=&name;=#lfr_suchergebnis * OK-TAU58, reconstructed in 2016, former Swiss registered HB-UAD E.114M (part of the reconstruction included refitting the aircraft with an original Praga B2 engine).http://translate.google.cz/translate?hl=en&sl;=cs&u;=http://avia.vyrobce.cz/doc/e114stavba.htm&prev;=search Aircraft on display E.114M OK-BGL is on display in the Prague Aviation Museum in Prague.Aviation Museums and Collections of Mainland Europe 2009, p.63 Variants Praga E.214 photo from Le Pontentiel A√©rien Mondial 1936 Post-war built Praga E.114 Air Baby HB-UAD visiting Manchester Airport from Switzerland in March 1953 All variants apart from the E.115 had the same dimensions.

The website of the MOWA is https://mowachoctawindians.com/ https://mowachoctawindians.com/ In 1978, the Choctaws of Washington County, Alabama became recognized under Legislative Acts of the State of Alabama and further that all laws to the contrary were made null and void with regard to the Choctaw under the Code of Alabama of 1975, as amended. In 1983, the Attorney General of State of Alabama confirmed that the MOWA were eligible for federal programs and services as Indians. In 1984 the legislature passed the Davis-Strong Act to set up a commission to represent Native American interests in the state. The commission established rules for recognition, and included the MOWA Band among the first seven tribes to be recognized. Since that time, another two tribes have been recognized by the state. History The historic Choctaw people occupied extensive territory in what later became the states of Alabama, the original Mississippi Territory and the original Louisiana Territory. The US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, authorizing the federal government to arrange for exchanges of land in order to remove the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast and to territory west of the Mississippi River. The Choctaw were not eligible for land exchange under the terms of the Indian Removal Act. A portion of the Choctaw were the first to be voluntarily removed along with the Wea, Ohio, and some Cherokee Indians, believing they had ceded their land under various treaties. They were removed to Indian Territory in the State of Mississippi, such as the case of Greenwood LeFlore and Peter Pitchlynn or else Arkansas along the River, later the state of Oklahoma. The MOWA Band of Indians is composed of descendants of Native American Indians who remained in Alabama. In the late 20th century, the MOWA Band and several groups of Native Americans in Alabama pressed for recognition by the state. The Choctaws Indians of Mobile had been continuously recognized since at least the 1700‚Äôs by primarily the same names and surnames used by the Choctaws today. The same people who continuously survived and maintained their own distinct communities. The state legislature passed the Davis-Strong Act in 1984 and established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission to represent Native Americans in the state. Made up of leaders of several tribes, the Commission created rules for recognition, and recognized seven tribes at the time, including the MOWA Band. The Commission has since recognized two more Tribes. The Alabama Inter-Tribal Council was established for Indians by Indians and is composed solely of the Indian Tribes not presently administratively recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under 25 CFR 83. The Sovereignty of these same Tribes has been formally acknowledged by the United States Federal Courts. The MOWA Indians have primarily and nearly exclusively intermarried with other known Choctaw families since at least 1800 when records became prevalent. Prior to 1800, it would have been nearly impossible to produce a family with a non-Indian outside of white traders and missionaries who were also known to have been white. Organization Historical records note the presence of the Choctaw in the southwest region of Alabama since pre-historic Times. The MOWA have most of their territory in Washington County, Alabama. In 1979, the MOWA Indians organized as the MOWA Band of Indians of South Alabama. The MOWA incorporated as an Alabama non-profit corporation in Washington County, Alabama. While most of the MOWA reside inside Washington County, some members have moved and live in other locations across the entire United States. Some have pursued education and employment opportunities. The MOWA has a chief, a tribal council of eleven members, and a tribal judge. According to their constitution, the chief and members of the tribal council are elected. The tribal judge is appointed by the chief with the approval of the tribal council. The MOWA have an annual Pow Wow each year, typically in the fall.

Although the style of the monastery has been modified to accommodate Western social and cultural mores, it retains close links with Thailand especially monasteries of the Thai Forest Tradition and is supported by an international community of Asians and Westerners.Much of the information for this article, along with samples of Ajahn Sumedho‚Äôs teachings, can be found in the book, \\"Cittaviveka: teachings from the silent mind\\". This book and others can be obtained on the Forest Sangha website www.forestsangha.org under ‚ÄòPublicationsAjahn Chah‚Äôs Forest Monasteries can visited via www.forestsangha.org \\"Cittaviveka\\" is a term used in the PƒÅli scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. The monastery was so named by Ajahn Sumedho, the first abbot (1979‚Äì1984) as a suitable word-play on \\"Chithurst,\\" the hamlet in which its main house is situated. The title \\"Chithurst Buddhist Monastery\\" is also commonly used, although the approximately 175 acres/70 hectares of the monastery‚Äôs land extend into the adjacent parish. Subsequent abbots have been Ajahn ƒÄnando (1984‚Äì1992), Ajahn Sucitto (1992-2014) and Ajahn Karuniko (2014-). The monastery is supported by donations, and lay people may visit or stay for a period of time as guests free of charge. Teachings are given on a regular basis, generally on weekends.See the monastery‚Äôs website www.cittaviveka.org for details. History Photo from the Dhamma hall at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery Foundation (1979-1984) Cittaviveka is a \\"Forest Monastery\\" in the lineage of Ajahn Chah, where the emphasis is on training in terms of the precepts and renunciation established by the Vinaya (the Buddhist Monastic Code), and on a communal lifestyle. The monastery is mostly made up of woodland and heath (Hammer Wood) which has a few kutƒ´s (huts [Thai]) for monks and nuns, but communal activities, teaching and guest accommodation are situated in two adjacent houses ‚Äì Chithurst House (for men) and ƒÄloka Cottage (for women). Hammer Wood was given to the Sangha in 1978-9, an act which precipitated the purchase of the semi-derelict Chithurst House which stood nearby. Later in 1979, another nearby cottage was purchased. This was renamed ƒÄloka Cottage. A small group of bhikkhus took up residence on 22 June 1979, along with samaneras (novices) and anagƒÅrikas [\\"homeless ones\\" that is men living under the Eight Precepts.] They were soon joined by four women who took up the training as eight-precept nuns (mae-chee [\\"spiritual mothers\\"-Thai]) and who in 1983 became the first four sƒ´ladharƒÅ, ten-precept nuns.For an account of the establishment of the sƒ´ladharƒÅ Order see http://fsnewsletter.amaravati.org/html/81/order.htm [The term means \\"those who uphold virtue\\" in PƒÅli.] The initial priority of the community was the repair of Chithurst House, which took about five years. Along with this was the reafforestation of Hammer Wood (which had been turned into commercial coppice after the First World War), a project which continues to this day. In the more specifically monastic aspect of the monastery‚Äôs development was the establishment of an ordination precinct (sƒ´ma) by Ven. ƒÄnandamaitreya Mahanayaka of Sri Lanka in 3rd. June 1981. This coincided with the conferring of Preceptorship (UpajjhƒÅya) on Ajahn Sumedho. This gave Ajahn Sumedho the authority to grant bhikkhu ordination (upasampadƒÅ) and accordingly the first three candidates were ordained on 16 July 1981. Although bhikkhu ordinations had taken place in Britain before, they had taken place on temporary sƒ´mas; the first established sƒ´ma was at Chithurst. Ordinations took place at Cittaviveka on a yearly basis throughout the eighties, including the first sƒ´ladharƒÅ ordination in 1983, but, as the sƒ´ma is just a square on the lawn bounded by stones, when other indoor sƒ´mas were subsequently established at Harnham (Aruna Ratanagiri) and Amaravati, these weatherproof areas were favoured. Cittaviveka will in the future establish a new sƒ´ma inside its main meditation hall. On 1 August 1984, Ajahn Sumedho left Cittaviveka to establish Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in Hertfordshire. This was because of a felt need to provide more accommodation for the growing Orders of bhikkhus and sƒ´ladharƒÅ and also of lay people who wished to study and train under his guidance. Taking half the bhikkhu community and all the sƒ´ladharƒÅ to Amaravati, he left Ajahn ƒÄnando, one of the original founders, to supervise Cittaviveka as Abbot. Development (1984-1992) Teaching meditation retreats for lay people was a key feature of Ajahn Sumedho‚Äôs practice, a duty which took him away from the monastery for long periods. Ajahn ƒÄnando also taught retreats, but also put energy into continuing the rebuilding of the monastery and training junior bhikkhus. With much of the major repairs completed by 1984, more attention was given to reafforestation; bhikkhus would also spend time on retreat in the Hammer Wood in tents and tepees or in one of two kutis that had been erected there. A small group of sƒ´ladharƒÅ returned to Cittaviveka in 1986, and with changes in personnel, nuns have been a feature of the monastery ever since. During this period, the monastery also became more integrated into the local landscape, with the bhikkhus and sƒ´ladharƒÅ going out on alms-round on a daily basis. Later years (1992- ) Ajahn Sucitto, abbot of Chithurst Buddhist monastery 1992-2014. Ajahn Sucitto, another one of the original founders, became Abbot on 7 June 1992. Work on developing the monastery continued with further kutis in Hammer Wood, and then the construction of a large meditation hall (Dhamma Hall) on the site of a ruined coachhouse in the grounds of Chithurst House (1998‚Äì2004). Ajahn Sucitto stepped down in 2014 and Ajahn Karuniko was invited to take over the position of Abbot. In 2006, the English Sangha Trust purchased another house for nuns, situated opposite to ƒÄloka and now called Rocana VihƒÅra. The nuns live there largely autonomous from the male monastic community. Two or three members of the community currently go to the local towns on alms-rounds (pindapƒÅda) for their daily meal on a couple of days of each week. The traditional wayfaring practice (tudong [Thai from PƒÅli \\"dhutanga\\" ‚Äì \\"austere\\") of walking cross-country for several weeks, living on alms and sleeping out is also an established voluntary practice during the warmer months of the year.For accounts of tudong, see \\"Walking Dhutanga in Britain\\" by Bhikkhu Sucitto, Bodhi Leaf/Wheel Publications.

She was scrapped in 1969. Prior to Commissioning The USS Bellatrix was laid down as the Fleetwood on 16 October 1944 in Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Company under the Maritime Commission contract. Sponsored by Mrs. Agatha Bittman, hull 1207 was launched on 4 December 1944 and the Fleetwood was delivered on 21 June 1945. Initially turned over to the United Fruit Company, the Fleetwood sailed in the North Atlantic Ocean under contract until October 1946. Thereafter, it was transferred by the Maritime Commission to the Pacific Far-East Line making numerous cargo runs to ports throughout the Pacific Ocean, including that of the Alaskan waters. After April 1958, although still operated by the Pacific Far-East Line, the Fleetwood served the Military Sea Transportation Service. On 22 August 1961 the Fleetwood was transferred back to the US Navy, who converted the vessel into a USN stores ship at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, with work being completed on 13 October 1961. The Fleetwood was renamed Bellatrix AF-62, and was re-commissioned on 18 November 1961 at the Puget Sound yard under the command of Nathan E. Dozier.  Support of ships engaged in nuclear testing  Following outfitting and shakedown training based in San Diego, California, the Bellatrix departed from her home port in San Francisco, California on 3 March 1962, beginning her first deployment into the western Pacific. The Bellatrix provided logistical support for Joint Task Force 8, responsible for Operation Dominic I and II, which tested nuclear weapons at Christmas Island. The remainder of that deployment was spent re-supplying Navy ships via both underway and in-port replenishment including visits to Yokosuka, Sasebo, Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In June 1962, the Bellatrix returned to San Francisco for an overhaul.  Vietnam operations support  Bellatrix spent the next six years supplying ships of the U.S. 7th Fleet in the Vietnam War. After August 1964, she was concentrated on supporting the fleet operating off the coast of Vietnam. The fleet was tasked with bolstering the defenses of the South Vietnamese Republic. Until September 1968, Bellatrix alternated between brief periods on the West Coast of the United States, and longer periods off the coast of Vietnam. During that period the Bellatrix visited Nagasaki, Midway Island and Pearl Harbor.  Decommissioning  While an overhaul late in the summer of 1968 was being prepared, the decision was taken to decommission the Bellatrix. Accordingly, she was decommissioned on 30 September 1968, at Hunters Point, California. After being decommissioned, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. The vessel was eventually sold for scrapping to Ridell Explorations Inc. for $36,606.60 on 24 March 1969, under MARAD contract PD-X-824 27 February 1969.

The mountain is part of the Methow Mountains, a subset of the Cascade Range. Silver Star is the dominant feature in the Washington Pass area and visible from the North Cascades Highway. It was first climbed by Lage Wernstedt in 1926. The summit ridge of Silver Star consists of a long ridge of spires (the Wine Spires) leading to the main summit. Vasiliki Ridge radiates north from the Wine Spires, and Snagtooth Ridge extends south from Silver Star. The mountain is a steep ragged wall as seen from the west on Highway 20. The north side glacier reaches to just below the ridge line. The easiest route is up the moderate glacier from the north via Silver Star Creek. Silver Star Mountain stands within the watershed of the Methow River, which drains into the Columbia River's Lake Pateros reservoir, impounded by Wells Dam. The west and north sides of Silver Star drain into Early Winters Creek, thence into the Methow River. The southeast side of Silver Star drains into Cedar Creek, thence into Early Winters Creek.

The Wine Spires of Silver Star Mountain Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Silver Star Mountain is located in the Golden Horn batholith and composed of granite like many of the peaks in the Washington Pass area. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Silver Star is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift).Silver Star and its glacier seen from Slate Peak. Silver Moon to the left. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Snow accumulation sustains the Silver Star Glacier on the north slope of the mountain. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

For instance, one could select for both increased milk yield and increased milk fat content in cows via tandem selection by first selecting those with the best of one trait, say those that produce highest milk yield, and then when that trait is at a satisfactory level, by starting to select for those cows that produce milk with the greatest milk fat content instead. However, for cows to produce milk with greater fat content, yield may have to go down due to, perhaps, limits of the cows metabolism. So, while you are selecting for cows which have increased milk fat content, the yield of milk they are producing may also go down, thus reversing the selection process previously performed to increase it.

He features as a United States agent, working variously for the CIA and DIA. He uses his ambiguous sexuality (\\"Is that [homosexuality] true about you, Clive?\\" \\"Not necessarily\\") to advantage in The Word of a Gentleman, and sees sex as a mere means to an end. Lyle contrasts sharply with the recognisably humane David Cane in Fallback. Cane is sacrificed in the interests of national security, but Lyle is introduced as Cane's replacement, and ultimately trains Martin Ross to infiltrate Vologda and sabotage an offensive Soviet ICBM programme. In Scimitar, Lyle takes on a more human aspect, admitting this (\\"Well that's something I never did, I never killed a kid\\") as he and David Ross return from Afghanistan.

A member of the Ayyubid Dynasty, he became Sultan of Egypt for a brief period in 1249‚Äì50.  Background  Turanshah was not trusted by his father, who sent him to Hasankeyf to keep him away from Egyptian politics.Irwin, Robert, The Middle East in the Middle Ages: The Early Mamluk Sultanate, 1250-1382, p.20. He learned of his father's death from Faris ad-Din Aktai, commander of his father's Bahri Mamluks, who had been sent from Egypt to bring him back and pursue the war against Louis IX of France and the Seventh Crusade. Aktai arrived at Hasankeyf early in Ramadan 647/December 1249 and a few days later, 11 Ramadan/18 December, Turanshah and around fifty companions had started off for Egypt.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.301 The party took a circuitous route to avoid being intercepted by hostile Ayyubid rivals and on 28 Ramadan 647/4 January 1250 they arrived at the village of Qusayr, near Damascus, making their ceremonial entry the next day, when Turanshah was officially proclaimed Sultan.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.302  Rule  Turanshah remained in Damascus for three weeks, distributing huge sums of money to secure loyalty among the troops and notables of the city. He then set off for Egypt and arrived in Mansura with only a small retinue on 19 Dhu'l Qa'da/23 February. Ignoring his father's written advice to honour and rely on the Bahri Mamluks, he rapidly set about appointing his own (Muazzami) Mamluks to key positions.Irwin, Robert, The Middle East in the Middle Ages: The Early Mamluk Sultanate, 1250-1382, p.21. He also promoted many black slaves to prominence. A black eunuch was made ustadar (master of the royal household) while another became amir jandar (master of the royal guard).Irwin, Robert, The Middle East in the Middle Ages: The Early Mamluk Sultanate, 1250-1382, p.21. Both of these approaches alienated the powerful Bahri Mamluks. The account given of Turanshah by historians writing during the Mamluk period cannot necessarily be relied on, but according to them, he was unbalanced, of low intelligence and had a nervous twitch.Irwin, Robert, The Middle East in the Middle Ages: The Early Mamluk Sultanate, 1250-1382, p.21. On one occasion he went about chopping the tops off candles, shouting 'this is how I will deal with the Bahri Mamluks!' Irwin, Robert, The Middle East in the Middle Ages: The Early Mamluk Sultanate, 1250-1382, p.21. Turanshah led the Egyptian forces in the battle of Fariskur in 1250, the last battle of the Seventh Crusade. Here the Crusaders were totally defeated and Louis IX of France was captured. Eventually the Bahris had had enough of him. They had been offended by Turanshah's treatment of them and, possibly, believed that once he had recovered Damietta from the Crusaders, he would turn against them. A faction of them, led by Baibars, resolved to kill him, and his murder was described in particular detail by crusader historian Jean de Joinville.Wedgwood, Ethel (trans.) The Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville: A New English Version Ethel Wedgwood, E.P. Dutton and Co., New York 1906, Chapter XV p. 172  Death  On 28 Muharram 648/2 May 1250, Turanshah gave a great banquet. At the end of the feast, Baibars and a group of Mamluk soldiers rushed in and tried to kill him. Turanshah was injured, as apparently a sword blow had split his hand open. Wounded, he managed to escape to a tower next to the Nile River. The Mamluks pursued him and set the tower on fire. He was forced down by the flames tried to run for the river, but was struck in the ribs by a spear. He fled into the river, trailing the spear. His pursuers stood on the banks and shot at him with arrows, even as he begged for his life, offering to abdicate. Unable to kill him from the shore, Baibars himself waded out into the water and hacked the Sultan to death. It is said that Faris ad-Din Aktai then cut out his heart and took it to the captive Louis IX, hoping to receive a reward, which he did not.Wedgwood, Ethel (trans.) The Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville: A New English Version Ethel Wedgwood, E.P. Dutton and Co., New York 1906, Chapter XV p. 172 According to some accounts it was in fact Aktai rather than Baibars who murdered him.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.303  Legacy  Turanshah's father As-Salih Ayyub had been the last in the dynasty to exercise effective rule over Egypt and hegemony over the other Ayyubid domains. Turanshah was the last in the main Ayyubid line to rule in Egypt, with the exception of the six-year-old child Al Ashraf Musa, who was briefly installed as nominal Sultan by the Bahri Mamluk Aybak in a bid to present a veneer of Ayyubid legitimacy to Mamluk rule in Egypt at a time when the Syrian Ayyubids were threatening to invade.Humphreys, R.

The station's studios and transmitter are both co-located along Jordan Lane (SR 53) in Northwest Huntsville. WEUP is simulcast on WEUV (1190 AM) in Moulton, Alabama. The WEUP call letters were on the 1600 AM signal from 1958 until a 2006 re-alignment with co-owned WEUV (originally 1700 AM) and WHIY (originally 1190 AM). History WEUP began broadcasting on March 20, 1958, on a 1000-watt 1600 kilohertz (kHz) AM transmitter. This transmitter was built by the Brennan/Benns group while building WVOK, WAPE, and WBAM. The station was owned by Leroy and Viola Garrett, who became the first African-American owners of a radio station in the state of Alabama. WEUP first broadcast from a pink trailer in the grounds of Syler Tabernacle Church in Huntsville, before moving to its present studios on Jordan Lane. The station's format was a mixture of gospel music, sermons, news, and R&B;, everyday from sunrise to 6 p.m. Listeners of 1600 AM were able to hear a viable mix of gospel and soul music as well as news and public affairs catering to the interests of the Tennessee Valley's black population. The Garretts made history when they testified before a congressional committee in 1963, the outcome of which resulted in the change of a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) law regulating 24-hour broadcasts in the 1960s. That same year WEUP began 24-hour broadcasts, yet another milestone for urban radio. The station celebrated its 50th anniversary by hosting a Blues Festival on August 16, 2008, at Kalea Park in Meridianville, Alabama. The festival featured national, regional, and local blues artists performing live. Ownership Viola Garrett decided to sell the station in 1987 after the death of her husband, Leroy. Later that year, Hundley Batts, Sr. and Dr. Virginia Caples, another married couple, assumed the ownership and operation of WEUP. They also acquired another station, WEUZ- FM (92.1 FM), licensed to Minor Hill, Tennessee, (just north of the Alabama border) and brought WEUP onto the FM broadcast airwaves. They operated WEUP & WEUZ-FM under the parent company name of Broadcast One. They continued to expand the station's audience by acquiring WHIY (then at 1190 AM) and WXKI (103.1 FM, now WEUP-FM), both licensed to Moulton in 1989. WEUV (then at 1700 AM) was later added to the group of stations that are part of the WEUP broadcast family. Awards In November 2007, WEUP owner Hundley Batts was recognized as one of five 2008 Northern Alabama Business Hall of Fame Laureates by Junior Achievement of Northern Alabama. Batts was honored as a civic leader and for his contributions to free enterprise and the community. Translators WEUP programming is also carried on a broadcast translator station to extend or improve the coverage area of the station.

The school was formerly the biggest school in Ireland with over 1600 pupils until a new school was built in the neighboring town of Moville. The current principal of the school is John McGuiness with Liz Kelly and Owen McConway as vice principals. The student population is over 1000 again at present. Sports The school's senior soccer squad became All-Ireland champions following a 2-1 won victory over Presentation Brothers College, Cork on 11 March 2016.

It was the sixth named storm, second hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Felix formed from a tropical wave on August 31, passing through the southern Windward Islands on September 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status. On the next day, Felix rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane, and early on September 3 it was upgraded to Category 5 status; at 2100 UTC on the same day, the hurricane was downgraded to Category 4 status, but strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of September 4. On September 4, Felix made landfall just south of the border between Nicaragua and Honduras, causing at least 133 deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in Central America. Because of its devastating impact on Central America, especially on Nicaragua, its name was retired after the 2007 season. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 24, tracking westward at approximately 14 mph (23 km/h) with no associated deep convection and a weak low-level inverted-V curvature. Initially difficult to locate on satellites, the wave axis tracked through a moist environment and developed an area of scattered thunderstorms. By August 25 visible satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning just north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave continued to develop moderate to strong convection, and on August 27 a 1012 mbar (hPa; 29.88 inHg) low pressure area developed about 830 mi (1,340 km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde. For the next several days the system failed to organize significantly; however, on August 30 the wave became better defined with more representation of the cyclonic turning into the low. Convection increased early the next day, and a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system reported the presence of a closed low-level circulation; accordingly, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Six at 2100 UTC on August 31 while it was located about 180 mi (295 km) east-southeast of the southern Windward Islands. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was located to the south of a strong ridge, resulting in a west-northwest motion. The system maintained curved rainbands with expanding outflow, and with light wind shear and warm water temperatures the environment favored further development. Its deep convection consolidated very near the center, and shortly after passing over the island of Grenada the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Felix early at around 0900 UTC on September 1. Felix quickly strengthened as it developed a small inner core of convection with tightly-wound bands around the center, and by late on September 1 an eye feature was observed on satellite imagery. Based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft, the National Hurricane Center estimated that Felix attained hurricane status by early on September 2 while located about 155 mi (250 km) east-northeast of Bonaire. Hurricane Felix rapidly intensifying south of Hispaniola on September 2 Tracking through an area of extremely low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content, Felix quickly developed a well-defined eye, a symmetric cloud structure, and strong upper-level outflow; consequently, the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward. Felix attained major hurricane status at around 1800 UTC on September 2 while located about 490 mi (790 km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. Rapid strengthening continued, and later that day the hurricane attained Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with the pressure dropping to 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg); this corresponded to a falling rate of 3.4 mbar (hPa; 0.1 inHg) per hour, which the National Hurricane Center described as \\"one of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed.\\" A Hurricane Hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye, and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 14 mi (22 km). A subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight experienced flight level winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), with peak surface winds of 163 mph (263 km/h) reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall; surface winds of 189 mph (306 km/h) were found in its northeastern quadrant, although the National Hurricane Center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds. Based on the observations, it is estimated Felix attained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) by 0000 UTC on September 3 while located about 390 mi (625 km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, making Felix a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale. While investigating the hurricane, Hurricane Hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel, which forced the flight to abort the mission. Continuing quickly westward, the diameter of the eye decreased to 12 mi (19 km), and the National Hurricane Center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 929 mbar (hPa; 27.43 inHg) about seven hours after it reached Category 5 status. Initially, Felix was predicted to track west-northwestward, striking Belize before crossing the Yucat√°n Peninsula; however, its path remained nearly due westward. Subsequently, cloud tops near the center started to warm as the eye became less distinct, and by 1800 UTC on September 3, Felix weakened to Category 4 status with winds of 145 mph (235 km/h). On September 4, Felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day. Felix was upgraded to a Category 5 for the second time at 1040 UTC, and made landfall in Nicaragua just south of its border with Honduras, in the Mosquito Coast region, as a Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph (260 km/h) winds. Hurricane Felix struck Nicaragua on the same day as Hurricane Henriette struck the Baja California Peninsula in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which marked the second recorded occurrence that a North Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day; the previous occurrence was on August 23, 1992, when Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas on the same day Hurricane Lester hit Mexico's Baja California Peninsula. By nine hours after moving ashore, the system maintained a well-organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands, although the winds rapidly decreased; early on September 5 Felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper-level circulation became detached from the low-level portion. The system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern Honduras, and at 0900 UTC the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on Felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area. The remnants of Felix tracked west- northwestward over other portions of Latin America, and eventually dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on September 7. Preparations Hurricane Felix in the western Caribbean Sea, nearing Central America on September 3 Upon Felix's becoming a tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning was issued for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago, and Grenada and its dependencies; a tropical storm watch was also issued for the northeastern Venezuela coast from Cuman√° to Pedernales, including Isla Margarita, as well as the ABC islands. The National Emergency Management Agency of Tobago was fully activated, with 79 shelters opened on the island. Coinciding with the upgrade of Felix to tropical storm status, the watch for the ABC islands was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. A hurricane watch was added to the islands early on September 2, where several tourists attempted to leave by plane prior to the arrival of the storm. Early on September 2, the government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm watch for the island, which was canceled as the hurricane passed far to its south. Later on September 2, a tropical storm watch was issued for Grand Cayman, and the next day a tropical storm warning was put in place on Providencia Island. A hurricane watch was issued for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala and the entire coastline of Belize at 1200 UTC on September 3. At 0300 UTC on September 3, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane watch from Lim√≥n to the Honduras/Nicaragua border, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. At the same time, a hurricane watch was extended westward to the Honduras/Guatemala border, and early on September 4 a tropical storm warning was put in place for the same region. Officials ordered evacuations for citizens in low-lying areas near the coastline; by midday on September 3, around 300 tourists evacuated from the Bay Islands department, with an additional 400 preparing to leave by plane; approximately 2,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas. By the time the hurricane made landfall, about 20,000 people in Honduras left for safer areas. At 1500 UTC on September 3, about 21 hours before its final landfall, the government of Nicaragua issued a hurricane warning from Puerto Cabezas northward to the national border. About 12 hours before landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued from Puerto Cabezas southward to Prinzapolka. Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, officials sent about 140,000 lbs (63,000 kg) of meals and emergency supplies to near the landfall location. Impact Caribbean Islands Felix passing Aruba At around 1200 UTC on September 1 a wind gust of 46 mph (74 km/h) was recorded on Barbados, and around the same time a gust of 44 mph (71 km/h) was observed in Saint Vincent. The storm produced heavy rainfall across the Windward Islands. On Trinidad, heavy precipitation caused mudslides and overflown rivers which destroyed some bridges; moderate winds damaged several buildings on the island. Damage on neighboring Tobago was concentrated on its northern portion, where several mudslides resulted from the rainfall; monetary damage on Tobago was estimated at $250,000 (2007 TTD; $40,000 2007 USD, $ USD). Felix produced gusty winds on Grenada, which downed several power lines and destroyed the roofs of two houses; rough waves also broke several vessels from their anchors. In St. Lucia, winds from the storm damaged the roof of a store in Castries, which collapsed and destroyed 12 vehicles. In the ABC islands, the hurricane resulted in gusty winds and heavy rainfall. However, little damage was reported in Bonaire; the precipitation left several homes submerged under water in Cura√ßao. In Aruba, the winds damaged one house and briefly left a northern town without power. Hurricane Felix produced strong winds and 10 ft (3 m) waves along the north coast of Venezuela, which left one person missing in Puerto Cabello. Central America Hurricane Felix after its landfall in Nicaragua on September 4 Early reports suggest severe damage in Honduras and Nicaragua after Felix made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane. In Puerto Cabezas, nearly every structure sustained at least roof damage, and many buildings were destroyed. Along the Mosquito Coast, flooding and mudslides were reported, destroying many houses and blocking highways. The government of Nicaragua declared the northern Caribbean coast a disaster area. The Miskito Cays, located about from Bilwi on the northeast coast of Nicaragua, was among the strongest hit areas. Hurricane Felix had not yet made landfall but reached maximum force when it passed over the Miskito Cays. The winds of the hurricane, with speeds of up to 160 mph (260 km/h), destroyed the Cays completely. Pillars that previously formed the base of the houses were the only remains on the Cays. At least 133 people were reported dead. At least 130 of them were in Nicaragua. While few details have been disclosed, they include at least 25 dead Miskito fishermen swept away, a drowning death on a boat, impact from a fallen tree and at least one indirect death caused by medical complications after birth. There were three deaths reported in Honduras, one of which was caused by a motor vehicle accident caused by heavy rain and landslides, and two caused by flooding in the capital city of Tegucigalpa. However, hundreds of others were missing (mostly at sea), and communication was difficult to impossible in many areas. Some survivors were also found on the Mosquito Coast who were initially reported missing. According to official information, at least 40,000 people were affected and 9,000 houses destroyed, most of them in the Nicaraguan city of Bilwi (Puerto Cabezas), where a \\"State of Disaster\\" was decreed by the government. A total lack of supplies and services were also reported in the area. The response was almost immediate. Help from Venezuela, Cuba, the United States, and Honduras was received, and a lot of organizations, such as the Nicaraguan Red Cross, the media and universities organized collections all over the country. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega visited Bilwi on the day after the catastrophe and promised the reconstruction of houses to the people affected. Damage in Nicaragua totaled 13.4 billion (2007 NIO; $716.3 million 2007 USD, $ USD). Inland flooding was also reported in Honduras, particularly near Tegucigalpa and in the northwestern regions where the Ulua River and the Chamelecon River overflowed into an agricultural area. Coastal flooding also damages the town of Izabal in Guatemala where 850 people were evacuated. Crop damage in Honduras amounted to L68.28 million (2007 HNL; $3.64 million 2007 USD, $ USD). Aftermath After Felix, over 160,000 people were suffering as many communities were stranded due to the storm. An appeal was given out by the United Nations for over $48 million (2007 USD, $ USD) in emergency aid to the hard-hit areas, particularly in Nicaragua. The appeal United States federal government delivered over $1.17 million (2007 USD, $ USD) in assistance, and the European Union responded with a donation of ‚Ç¨1 million euros ($1.36 million 2007 USD, $ USD). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) airlifted 120 rolls of plastic sheeting to the severely affected areas, which was used to repair the damaged roofs of health clinics and schools. USAID and OFDA also distributed 12,000 ten-liter water containers to Puerto Cabezas. Emergency relief supplies from both USAID and OFDA totaled to $94,190 (2007 USD, $ USD). In the aftermath of both Hurricane Dean and Felix, combined, USAID and OFDA donated $25,000 (2007 USD, $ USD) in aid to Honduras, and $1.2 million (2007 USD, $ USD) to Nicaragua. In addition, United States Department of Defense (USDOD) gave $1.5 million (2007 USD, $ USD) in humanitarian assistance to Nicaragua. In collaboration with USAID and OFDA, the USDOD delivered near 27.55 tons (25 metric tons) of food from the United Nation's World Food Program to the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region, Nicaragua. Retirement Due to the extensive damage and high death toll from Felix in Nicaragua, the name was officially retired on May 13, 2008 by the World Meteorological Organization during its annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, and will never be used again for any future Atlantic hurricanes. It was replaced by Fernand on List V of the Atlantic hurricane naming lists, which was used in the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season.

Fossils of E. regalis have been found in rocks of western North America that date from the late Campanian stage of the Cretaceous Period 73 million years ago. E. regalis was one of the largest hadrosaurids, measuring up to long and weighing around . It is classified as a genus of saurolophine (or hadrosaurine) hadrosaurid, a member of the group of hadrosaurids which lacked large, hollow crests, instead having smaller solid crests or fleshy combs. The distribution of E. regalis fossils suggests that it preferred coasts and coastal plains. It was a herbivore that could move on both two legs and four. Because it is known from several bone beds, E. regalis is thought to have lived in groups. The wealth of fossils has allowed researchers to study its paleobiology in detail, including its brain, how it may have fed, and its injuries and pathologies. Description E. annectens to a human Edmontosaurus regalis is known from several fossil specimens. E. regalis was among the largest hadrosaurids. A fully grown adult could have been long, and some of the larger specimens reached the range of to long. Its weight was on the order of . The type specimen of E. regalis, NMC 2288, is estimated as long.Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. p. 225. The skull was roughly triangular in profile.Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. pp. 151‚Äì164. One specimen preserved a soft tissue crest or wattle on the head. The beak was toothless, and both the upper and lower beaks were extended by keratinous material. Teeth were present only in the maxillae (upper cheeks) and dentaries (main bone of the lower jaw). They grew in columns, with an observed maximum of six in each, and the number of columns varied based on the animal's size. There were 51 to 53 columns per maxilla and 48 to 49 per dentary (teeth of the upper jaw being slightly narrower than those in the lower jaw). Life restoration E. regalis had thirteen neck vertebrae, eighteen back vertebrae, nine hip vertebrae, and an unknown number of tail vertebrae. The fore legs were shorter and less heavily built than the hind legs. Each hand had four fingers, with no thumb (first finger). The index second, third, and fourth fingers were approximately the same length and were united in life within a fleshy covering. Although the second and third finger had hoof-like claws, these bones were also within the skin and not apparent from the outside. The little finger was separate from the other three and was much shorter.Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. pp. 98‚Äì110. Each foot had three toes, with no big toe or little toe. The toes had hoof-like tips. Discovery and history Fossil skull ROM 801 The first known fossil remains that may belong to Edmontosaurus regalis were named Trachodon cavatus in 1871 by Edward Drinker Cope (the name is spelled in more recent sources as Trachodon avatus or even Trachodon atavus). This species was assessed without comment as a synonym of Edmontosaurus regalis in two reviews, although atavus predates regalis by several decades. In 1874 Cope named but did not describe Agathaumas milo for a sacral vertebra and shin fragments from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Laramie Formation of Colorado. Later that same year, he described these bones under the name Hadrosaurus occidentalis. The bones are now lost. As with Trachodon atavus, Agathaumas milo has been assigned without comment to Edmontosaurus regalis in two reviews, although predating regalis by several decades. Neither species has attracted much attention; both are absent from Lull and Wright's 1942 monograph, for example. A third obscure early species, Trachodon selwyni, described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902 for a lower jaw from what is now known as the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, was erroneously described by Glut (1997) as having been assigned to Edmontosaurus regalis by Lull and Wright. It was not, instead being designated \\"of very doubtful validity.\\"Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. pp. 220‚Äì221. More recent reviews of hadrosaurids have concurred. The type specimen of E. regalis is NMC 2288, consisting of a skull, articulated vertebrae up to the sixth tail vertebra, ribs, partial hips, an upper arm bone, and most of a hind limb. It was discovered in 1912 by Levi Sternberg. The second specimen, paratype NMC 2289, consists of a skull and skeleton lacking the beak, most of the tail, and part of the feet. It was discovered in 1916 by George F. Sternberg. Both skeletons were found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (formerly the lower Edmonton Formation) along the Red Deer River of southern Alberta, Canada. The Edmonton Formation lent Edmontosaurus its name. The name Edmontosaurus regalis (meaning \\"regal,\\" or, more loosely, \\"king-sized\\"), was coined in 1917 by Lawrence Lambe. Lambe found that his new dinosaur compared best to \\"Diclonius mirabilis\\" specimens (now assigned to Edmontosaurus annectens), and drew attention to the size and robustness of Edmontosaurus regalis. Initially, Lambe only described the skulls of the two skeletons, but returned to the genus in 1920 to describe the skeleton of NMC 2289. The postcrania of the type specimen remains undescribed, still in its plaster jackets. Skull NHM R8927 at the Natural History Museum Two more species that would come to be included with Edmontosaurus regalis were named from Canadian remains in the 1920s, but both would initially be assigned to the genus Thespesius. Gilmore named the first, Thespesius edmontoni, in 1924. T. edmontoni also came from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. It was based on NMC 8399, another nearly complete skeleton lacking most of the tail. NMC 8399 was discovered on the Red Deer River in 1912 by a Sternberg party. Its forelimbs, ossified tendons, and skin impressions were briefly described in 1913 and 1914 by Lambe, who at first thought it was an example of a species he'd named Trachodon marginatus, but then changed his mind. The specimen became the first dinosaur skeleton to be mounted for exhibition in a Canadian museum. Gilmore found that his new species compared closely to what he called Thespesius annectens, but left the two apart because of details of the arms and hands. He also noted that his species had more vertebrae than Marsh's in the back and neck, but proposed that Marsh was mistaken in assuming that the annectens specimens were complete in those regions. In 1926, Charles Mortram Sternberg named Thespesius saskatchewanensis for NMC 8509, a skull and partial skeleton from the Wood Mountain plateau of southern Saskatchewan. He had collected this specimen in 1921, from rocks that were assigned to the Lance Formation, now the Frenchman Formation. NMC 8509 included an almost complete skull, numerous vertebrae, partial shoulder and hip girdles, and partial hind limbs, representing the first substantial dinosaur specimen recovered from Saskatchewan. Sternberg opted to assign it to Thespesius because that was the only hadrosaurid genus known from the Lance Formation at the time. At the time, T. saskatchewanensis was unusual because of its small size, estimated at in length. Classification Reconstruction of E. regalis Most known complete Edmontosaurus skulls (E. regalis from left to upper middle) The cladogram below follows Godefroit et al. (2012) analysis. Paleobiology Close up of tooth crowns In a 2011 study, Campione and Evans recorded data from all known edmontosaur skulls and used it to plot a morphometric graph, comparing variable features of the skull with skull size. Their results showed that within Edmontosaurus regalis, many features previously used to classify additional species were directly correlated with skull size. Campione and Evans interpreted these results as strongly suggesting that the shape of E. regalis skulls changed dramatically as they grew. This has led to several apparent mistakes in classification in the past. The Campanian species Thespesius edmontoni, previously considered a synonym of E. annectens due to its small size and skull shape, is morel likely a subadult specimen of the contemporary E. regalis. A preserved rhamphotheca present in specimen LACM 23502 , housed in the Los Angeles County Museum, also indicates the beak of the related Edmontosaurus annectens was more hook-shaped and extensive than many illustrations in scientific and public media have previously depicted. Whether this was true of E. regalis as well is not known as of this time.https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/enough- with-the-duckbilled-dinosaurs/ Extensive bone beds are known for Edmontosaurus regalis, and such groupings of hadrosaurids are used to suggest that they were gregarious, living in groups. Two quarries containing E. regalis remains were identified in a 2007 database of fossil bone beds, from Alaska (Prince Creek Formation), and Alberta (Horseshoe Canyon Formation). Paleoecology Horseshoe Canyon Formation near Drumheller. The dark bands are coal seams. The Edmontonian land vertebrate age is defined by the first appearance of Edmontosaurus regalis in the fossil record. Although sometimes reported as of exclusively early Maastrichtian age, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was of somewhat longer duration. Deposition began approximately 73 million years ago, in the late Campanian, and ended between 68.0 and 67.6 million years ago. Edmontosaurus regalis is known from the lowest of five units within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, but is absent from at least the second to the top. Because of its wide distribution, which covers a distance from Alaska to Colorado and includes polar settings that would have had little light during a significant part of the year, Edmontosaurus regalis has been considered possibly migratory. A 2008 review of dinosaur migration studies by Phil R. Bell and Eric Snively proposed that E. regalis was capable of an annual round- trip journey, provided it had the requisite metabolism and fat deposition rates. Such a trip would have required speeds of about , and could have brought it from Alaska to Alberta. The possible migratory nature of E. regalis contrasts with many other dinosaurs, such as theropods, sauropods, and ankylosaurians, which Bell and Snively found were more likely to have overwintered. In contrast to Bell and Snively, Anusuya Chinsamy and colleagues concluded from a study of bone microstructure that polar edmontosaurs overwintered. Contemporary fauna As many as three quarters of the dinosaur specimens from badlands near Drumheller, Alberta may pertain to Edmontosaurus regalis. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. E. regalis shared the setting with fellow hadrosaurids Hypacrosaurus and Saurolophus, parksosaurid Parksosaurus, ceratopsids Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ankylosaurid Euoplocephalus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, ornithomimids Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, a variety of poorly known small theropods including troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurids Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. Edmontosaurus is found in coastal, near-marine settings, while Hypacrosaurus and Saurolophus are found in more continental lowlands. Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus are not usually found together. The typical edmontosaur habitat of this formation has been described as the back regions of bald cypress swamps and peat bogs on delta coasts. Pachyrhinosaurus also preferred this habitat to the floodplains dominated by Hypacrosaurus, Saurolophus, Anchiceratops and Arrhinoceratops. The Edmontonian-age coastal Pachyrhinosaurus-Edmontosaurus association is recognized as far north as Alaska.

It was released in the United States on 20 November 1948. Reception The New York Times wrote in 1948: \\"Although the Italian film artisans have been garnering justifiable acclaim here for the biting realism of their topical portraits, kudos has not been the rule where other themes were concerned. So it is pleasant to report that Four Steps in the Clouds rates a round of applause for its sensitive treatment of a thoroughly unspectacular subject.\\" The critic described Cervi's performance as \\"a beautifully wrought characterization\\" and Benetti's as \\"finely etched\\" and \\"poignant\\". Concerning the storyline, the critic wrote that \\"the improbability is outweighed by the performances of the cast and adeptness of direction, which makes Four Steps in the Clouds both believable and diverting.\\" Jacek Klinowski and Adam Garbicz covered the film in their 2012 book Feature Cinema in the 20th Century, where they assessed it as a break from the \\"banal\\" cinema of Blasetti's preceding period, and a return to a style he had employed ten years before, which they described as \\"innovative\\". Klinowski and Garbicz acknowledged that Four Steps in the Clouds, and Blasetti in general, had been important in the development of the Italian neorealist movement, but came up with several reservations about the film, and wrote how they would have preferred if the neorealists to a greater extent had been inspired by Luchino Visconti's Ossessione instead of Blasetti's films. The critics wrote about Four Steps in the Clouds: > Especially the first part of Blasetti's comedy, which takes place in a > crowded bus, comes across (despite its unrefined observations) as a striking > novelty and a veritable photograph of life. But the fact remains that the > director seems to have been carried away by his enthusiasm, although Four > Steps in the Clouds is certainly a film of quality. Its second lyrical- > nostalgic part is not weaker that the first, although with its popular- > generic tone it shows only the surface of events and reduces feelings to > simple opposites: dislike and friendship, obstinacy and tolerance, despair > and joy. Remakes The film was remade several times, as The Virtuous Bigamist in 1956, as A Walk in the Clouds in 1995, as Mungarina Minchu in 1997 and as Dhai Akshar Prem Ke in 2000.

He was best known as being the host that started the open talk radio format in Quebec in the 1950s. Born in Paris, France, Jarraud fought in 1939 with the French Army World War II in Belgium at the age of 17. He was decorated of the Croix de Guerre after he was captured by troops of Nazi Germany but later narrowly escaped the Germans. Outside of his military service, Jarraud worked for a circus as an acrobat and was also a manager for several French artists. In 1948, he decided to move to Canada. Jarraud was then interested in the media department. He then began to work as a radio host at Montreal station CJMS in 1955 and started the talk radio format which was a major development in Quebec radio media history. With CJMS, he was the host of a morning show during his stint at CJMS. He then moved to CKVL for 15 years before doing stints for CKLM and CHRS. In his final years he could be heard on the new CJMS. Jarraud made a brief attempt in politics when he was a Progressive Conservative Candidate in the 1974 federal elections in the riding of St. Henri. He finished second behind Liberal candidate Gerard Loiselle as the Liberal Party won a majority government under Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Jarraud was also known a negotiator and credited for saving several people from committing suicide, particularly people that attempted to jump off Montreal's Jacques-Cartier Bridge which was known as the bridge with the second highest suicidal rate in the world. Jarraud had used his experience at the circus for climbing the superstructure of the bridge to prevent people from jumping into the Saint Lawrence River below. It was Jarraud that influenced other people such as Claude Poirier to become a negotiator and crime reporter in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to his career as radio host, he also played in several television shows. Jarraud died in Paris on August 18, 2007 at the age of 84 just over a month after suffering from respiratory and heart problems.

However, the \\"indie\\" term may apply to other scenarios where the development of the game has some measure of independence from a publisher even if a publishers helps fund and distribute a game, such as creative freedom. Because of their independence and freedom to develop, indie games often focus on innovation, experimental gameplay, and taking risks not usually afforded in AAA games, and may explore the medium to produce unique experiences in art games. Indie games tend to be sold through digital distribution channels rather than at retail due to lack of publisher support. The term is synonymous with that of independent music or independent film in those respective mediums. Indie game development bore out from the same concepts of amateur and hobbyist programming that grew with the introduction of the personal computer and the simple BASIC computer language in the 1970s and 1980s. So-called bedroom coders, particularly in the United Kingdom, made their own games and used mail order to distribute their products, later shifting to other software distribution methods with the onset of the Internet in the 1990s such as shareware and other file sharing distribution methods, though by this time, interest in hobbyist programming had waned due to rising costs of development and competition from video game publishers and home consoles. The modern take on the indie game scene resulted in a combination of numerous factors in the early 2000s, including technical, economic, and social concepts that made indie games less expensive to make and distribute, but more visible to larger audiences and offered non-traditional gameplay from the current mainstream games. A number of indie games at that time became success stories that drove more interest into the area. New industry opportunities arose since then, include new digital storefronts, crowdfunding and other indie fund mechanisms to help new teams get their games off the ground, low-cost and open source development tools available for smaller teams across all gaming platforms, boutique indie game publishers that leave creative freedom to the developers, and industry recognition of indie games alongside mainstream ones at major game award events. Only recently had there become a concern of a rather large number of indie games, and while a projected \\"indiepocolylpse\\" in the mid-2010s never came to pass, discoverability of one's game remains an issue for most indie developers, with many indie games not being financially profitable. Examples of some successful indie games include Super Meat Boy, Fez, Braid, Minecraft, Shovel Knight, Undertale, and Cuphead.  Definition  The term \\"indie game\\" itself is based on similar terms like independent film and independent music, where the concept is often related to self-publishing and independence from major studios or distributors. However, as with both indie films and music, there is no exact, widely accepted definition of what constitutes an \\"indie game\\" besides falling well outside the bounds of triple-A video game development by large publishers and development studios. One simple definition, described by Laura Parker for GameSpot, says \\"independent video game development is the business of making games without the support of publishers\\", but this does not cover all situations. Indie games generally share certain common characteristics. One method to define an indie game is the nature of independence, which can either be: * Financial independence: In such situations, the developers have paid for the development and/or publication of the game themselves or from other funding sources such as crowd funding, and specifically without financial support of a large publisher. * Independence of thought: In this case, the developers crafted their game without any oversight or directional influence by a third party such as a publisher. Another means to evaluate a game as indie is to examine its development team, with indie games being developed by individuals, small teams, or small independent companies that are often specifically formed for the development of one specific game.; ; ; Typically, indie games are smaller than mainstream titles. Indie game developers are generally not financially backed by video game publishers, who are risk-averse and prefer \\"big-budget games\\". Instead, indie game developers usually have smaller budgets, usually sourcing from personal funds or via crowdfunding.; ; ; Being independent, developers do not have controlling interests or creative limitations, and do not require the approval of a publisher, as mainstream game developers usually do. Design decisions are thus also not limited by an allocated budget. Furthermore, smaller team sizes increase individual involvement. However, this view is not all-encompassing, as there are numerous cases of games where development is not independent of a major publisher but still considered indie. Some notable instances of games include: * Journey was created by thatgamecompany, but had financial backing of Sony as well as publishing support. Kellee Santiago of thatgamecompany believes that they are an independent studio because they were able to innovate on their game without Sony's involvement. * Bastion, similarly, was developed by Supergiant Games, but with publishing by Warner Bros. Entertainment, primarily to avoid difficulties with the certification process on Xbox Live. Greg Kasavin of Supergiant notes they consider their studio indie as they lack any parent company. * The Witness was developed by Jonathan Blow and his studio Thekla, Inc. Though self-funded and published, the game's development cost around $6 million and was priced at $40, in contrast to most indie games typically priced up to $20. Blow believed this type of game represented something between indie and AAA publishing. * No Man's Sky was developed by Hello Games, though with publishing but non-financial support from Sony; the game on release had a price equal to a typical AAA title. Sean Murray of Hello Games believes that because they are still a small team and the game is highly experimental that they consider themselves indie. Nidhogg is an example of an indie game that relies on a retro pixel-based 1980s style for its presentation Yet another angle to evaluate a game as indie is from its innovation, creativity, and artistic experimentation, factors enabled by small teams free of financial and creative oversight. This definition is reflective of an \\"indie spirit\\" that is diametrically opposite of the corporate culture of AAA development, and makes a game \\"indie\\", where the factors of financial and creative independence make a game \\"independent\\". Developers with limited ability to create graphics can rely on gameplay innovation. This often leads to indie games having a retro style of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, with simpler graphics atop the more complex mechanics. Indie games may fall into classic game genres, but new gameplay innovations have been seen. However, being \\"indie\\" does not imply that the game focuses on innovation. In fact, many games with the \\"indie\\" label can be of poor quality and may not be made for profit. Jesper Juul, an associate professor at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts that has studied the video game market, wrote in his book Handmade Pixels that the definition of an indie game is vague, and depends on different subjective considerations. Juul classified three ways games can be considered indie: those that are financially independent of large publishers, those that are aesthetically independent and significantly different of the mainstream art and visual styles used in AAA games, and those that present cultural ideas that are independent from mainstream games. Juul however wrote that ultimately the labeling of a game as \\"indie\\" still can be highly subjective and no single rule helps delineate indie games from non-indie ones. Games that are not as large as most triple-A games, but are developed by larger independent studios with or without publisher backing and that can apply triple-A design principles and polish due to the experience of the team, have sometimes been called \\"triple-I\\" games, reflecting the middle ground between these extremes. Ninja Theory's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is considered a prime example of a triple-I game. Indie games are distinct from open source games. The latter are games which are developed with the intent to release the source code and other assets under an open source license. While many of the same principles used to develop open source games are the same as for indie games, open source games are not developed for commercial gain and instead as a hobbyist pursuit. However, commercial sales are not a requirement for an indie game and such games can be offered as freeware, most notably with Spelunky on its original release and Dwarf Fortress with exception of a planned enhanced visual front- end version while its base version will remain free.  History  The onset of indie game development is difficult to track due to the broadness of what defines an indie game, and the term was not really in use until the early 2000s. Until the 2000s, other terms like amateur, enthusiast, and hobbyist software or games were used to describe such software. Today, terms like amateur and hobbyist development are more reflective of those that create mods for existing games, or work with specific technologies or game parts rather than the development of full games. Such hobbyists usually produce non- commercial products and may range from novices to industry veterans. BASIC and bedroom coders (1970s‚Äì1980s) There is some debate as to whether indie development started before PCs with games developed for mainframe computers at universities and other large institutions. Games such as 1963's Spacewar! were not commercially financed and were made by a small team, but there lacked a commercial sector of the video game industry at that time to distinguish from independent works. However, one of the earliest known examples of games developed on contract for these systems was that of Joyce Weisbecker, who considers herself the first indie designer, as she had created several games for the RCA Studio II console in 1976 as an independent contractor for RCA. When the first personal computers were released in 1977, they each included a pre-installed version of the BASIC computer language along with example programs, including games, to show what users could do with these systems. While the manufacturers also had released commercial games that could be purchased for computers, the availability of BASIC led to people trying to make their own programs. Sales of the 1978 rerelease of the book BASIC Computer Games by David H. Ahl that included the source code for over one hundred games, eventually surpassed over one million copies. The availability of BASIC inspired a number of people to start writing their own games. The ZX Spectrum was popular among British hobbyist programmers and helped to kick off its video game industry in the 1980s. While the commercial sector of the video game industry was focused on the growing home video game console market in the late 1970s to early 1980s, a number of games for personal computers were released by one- or two-man teams, self-distributed in stores or sold through mail order. This was particularly true in the United Kingdom, where video game consoles had not gained as much traction as in the United States. There, the early microcomputers such as the ZX Spectrum were popular, launching a range of \\"bedroom coders\\" which initiated the UK's video game industry. By 1984, the United Kingdom's game industry had become crowded with many professional development teams making games at a large pace. Game developer Chris Crawford warned potential small developers away from the commercial prospects of the field in late 1984: During this period, the idea that indie games could provide experimental gameplay concepts or demonstrate niche arthouse appeal had been established. Many games from the bedroom coders of the United Kingdom, such as Manic Miner (1983), incorporated the quirkiness of British humour and made them highly experimental games. Other games like Alien Garden (1982) showed highly-experimental gameplay. Infocom itself advertised its text-based interactive fiction games by eschewing their lack of graphics in lieu of the players' imagination, at a time that graphics-heavy action games were commonplace. Shareware and chasing the console (1990s) By the mid-1990s, the recognition of the personal computer as a viable gaming option, and advances in technology that led to 3D gaming created many commercial opportunities for video games. During the last part of the 1990s, visibility of games from these single or small team studios scene wanes, since a small team could not readily compete in costs, speed and distribution as a commercial entity could. The industry had started to coalesce around video game publishers that could pay larger developers to make games and handle all the marketing and publication costs as well as opportunities to franchise game series. Publishers tended to be risk averse due to high costs of production, and they would reject all small-size and too innovative concepts of small game developers. The market also became fractured due to the prevalence of video game consoles, which required expensive or difficult-to-acquire game development kits typically reserved for larger developers and publishers. There were still significant developments from smaller teams that laid the basis of indie games going forward. Shareware games became a popular means to distribute demos or partially complete games in the 1980s and into the 1990s, where players could purchase the full game from the vendor after trying it. As such demos were generally free to distribute, shareware demo compilations would frequently be included in gaming magazines at that time, providing an easy means for amateur and hobbyist developers to be recognized. The ability to produce numerous copies of games, even if just shareware/demo versions, at a low cost helped to propel the idea as the PC as a gaming platform. At the time, shareware was generally associated with hobbyist programmers, but with releases of Wolfenstein 3D in 1992 and Doom in 1993 showed the shareware route to be a viable platform for titles from mainstream developers. Rise of indie games from digital distribution (2000‚àí2005) N is a 2004 browser game that later was developed into a commercial indie game, N++ in 2015. The common take on indie games on personal computer took shape in the early 2000s from several factors. Key was the availability of online distribution over the Internet, allowing game developers to sell directly to players and bypassing limitations of retail distribution and the need for a publisher. Software technologies used to drive the growth of the World Wide Web, like Adobe Flash, were available at low cost to developers, and provided another means for indie games to grow. The new interest in indie games led to middleware and game engine developers to offer their products at low or no cost for indie development, in addition to open source libraries and engines. Dedicated software like GameMaker Studio and tools for unified game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine removed much of the programming barriers needed for a prospective indie developer to create these games. The commercial possibilities for indie games at this point helped to distinguish these games from any prior amateur game. There were other shifts in the commercial environment that were seen as drivers for the rise of indie games in the 2000s. Many of the games to be indie games of this period were considered to be the antithesis of mainstream games and which highlighted the independence of how these games were made compared to the collective of mainstream titles. Many of them took a retro-style approach to their design, art, or other factors in development, which proved popular with players. Social and political changes also led to the use of indie games not only for entertainment purposes but to also tell a message related to these factors, something that cannot be done in mainstream titles. In comparing indie games to independent film and the state of their respective industries, the indie game's rise was occurring approximately at the same relative time as its market was starting to grow exponentially and seen as a supporting offshoot of the mainstream works. Shifting industry and increased visibility (2005‚àí2014) Fez was one of several indie games highlighted in Indie Game: The Movie as indie games entered mainstream coverage. Indie games saw a large boost in visibility within the video game industry and the rest of the world starting around 2005. A key driver was the transition into new digital distribution methods with storefronts like Steam that offered indie games alongside traditional AAA titles, as well as specialized storefronts for indie games. While direct online distribution helped indie games to reach players, these storefronts allowed developers to publish, update, and advertise their games directly, and players to download the games anywhere, with the storefront otherwise handling the distribution and sales factors. While Steam itself initially began heavy curation, it eventually allowed for indie publishing with its Steam Greenlight and Steam Direct programs, vastly increasing the number of games available. Further driving indie game growth in this period came from the departure of large publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision from their smaller, one-off titles to focus on their larger, more successful properties, leaving the indie game space to provide shorter and more experimental titles as alternatives. Costs of developing AAA games had risen greatly, to an average cost of tens of millions of dollars in 2007‚Äì2008 per title, and there was little room for risks in gameplay experimentation. Another driver came from discussions related to whether video games could be seen as an art form; movie critic Roger Ebert postulated in open debates that video games could not be art in 2005 and 2006, leading to developers creating indie games to specifically challenge that notion. Indie video game development saw a further boost by the use of crowdfunding as a means for indie developers to raise funds to produce a game and to determine the desire for a game, rather than risk time and investment into a game that does not sell well. While video games had used crowdfunding prior to 2012, several large indie game-related projects successfully raised millions of dollars through Kickstarter, and since then, several other similar crowdfunding options for game developers have become available. Crowdfunding eliminated some of the cost risk associated with indie game development, and created more opportunities for indie developers to take chances on new titles. With more indie titles emerging during this period, larger publishers and the industry as a whole started taking notice of indie games as a significant movement within the field. One of the first examples of this was World of Goo (2008), where its developers 2D Boy had tried but failed to gain any publisher support prior to release. On release, the game was recognized at various award events including the Independent Games Festival, leading to publishers that had previously rejected 2D Boy to offer to publish it. Console manufactures also helped to boost recognition of indie games in this period. By the seventh generation of consoles in 2005, each platform provided online services for players, such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Network, which included digital distribution of games. Following the increased awareness of indie games for PC, these services started publishing indie games alongside commercial offerings to expand their libraries. The Xbox 360 had launched in 2005 with the Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA) which had included some indie games among other titles, but these drew little attention in the first few years. In 2008, Microsoft ran its \\"XBLA Summer of Arcade\\" promotion which included the releases of indie games Braid, Castle Crashers, and Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 alongside two AAA games. While all three indie games had high number of downloads, Braid was a critical darling and drew mainstream media recognition for a game developed by only two people. Microsoft continued to follow up on this promotion in the following years, bringing in more games onto XBLA including Super Meat Boy, Limbo, and Fez. Sony and Nintendo followed suit, also wooing indie developers to bring games onto their platforms. By 2013, all three console manufactures had established programs that allowed indie developers to apply for low-cost development toolkits and licenses to publish directly onto the console's respective storefronts following approval processes. A number of \\"boutique\\" indie game publishers were founded in this period to support funding, technical support, and publishing of indie games across various digital and retail platforms. The single best-selling game of all time, Minecraft, was also originally released as an indie game during this period. The 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie covers several of the games that flourished from this period. Mobile games also became popular with indie developers, with inexpensive development tools and low-barrier storefronts with the App Store and Google Play which opened in the late 2000s. Fears over saturation and discoverability (2015‚àípresent) Leading into 2015, there was concern that the rise of easy-to-use tools to create and distribute video games could lead to an oversupply of video games, this was termed the \\"indiepocalypse\\". This perception of an indiepocalypse is not unanimous; Jeff Vogel stated in a talk at GDC 2016 that any downturn was just part of the standard business cycle. The size of the indie game market was estimated in March 2016 to be at least $1 billion per year for just those games offered through Steam. Mike Wilson, Graeme Struthers and Harry Miller, the co-founders of indie publisher Devolver Digital, stated in April 2016 that the market in indie games is more competitive than ever but continues to appear healthy with no signs of faltering. Gamasutra said that by the end of 2016, while there had not be any type of catastrophic collapse of the indie game market, there were signs that the growth of the market had significantly slowed and that it has entered a \\"post-indiepocalypse\\" phase as business models related to indie games adjust to these new market conditions. While there has not been any type of collapse of the indie game field since 2015, there are concerns that the market is far too large for many developers to get noticed. Very few selected indie titles get wide coverage in the media, and are typically referred to as \\"indie darlings\\". In some cases, indie darlings are identified through consumer reactions that praise the game, leading to further coverage; examples of such games include Celeste and Untitled Goose Game. However, there are also times where the video game media may see a future title as a success and position it as an indie darling before its release, only to have the game fail to make a strong impression on players, such as in the case of No Man's Sky and Where the Water Tastes Like Wine. Discoverability has become an issue for indie developers as well. With the Steam distribution service allows any developer to offer its game with minimal cost to them, there are thousands of games being added each year, and developers have become to rely heavily on Steam's discovery tools - methods to tailor catalog pages to customers based on past purchases - to help sell their titles. Mobile app stores have had similar problems with large volumes of offers but poor means for discovery by consumers in the late 2010s. Several indie developers have found it critical to have a good public relations campaign across social media and to interact with the press to make sure a game is noticed early on in its development cycle to get interest and maintain that interest through release, which adds to costs of development. In addition to titles like Celeste and Untitled Goose Game, other highly successful indie games released during this period included Undertale, Complete list. Stardew Valley, and Cuphead. Other regions Indie games are generally associated with Western regions, specifically with North American, European, and Oceanic areas. However, other countries have had similar expansions of indie games that have intersected with the global industry. Japanese d≈çjin soft In Japan, the d≈çjin soft community has generally been treated as a hobbyist activity up through the 2010s. Computers and bedroom coding had taken off similarly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but the computer market was quickly overwhelmed by consoles. Still, hobbyist programmers continued to develop games. One area that Japan had focused on were game development kits, specialized software that would allow users to create their own games. A key line of these were produced by ASCII Corporation, which published ASCII a hobbyist programming magazine that users could share their programs with. Over time, ASCII saw the opportunity to publish game development kits, and by 1992, released the first commercial version of the RPG Maker software. While the software cost money to obtain, users could release completed games with it as freeware or commercial products, which established the potential for a commercial independent games market by the early 2000s, aligning with the popularity of indie games in the West. Like other Japanese fan-created works in other media, d≈çjin games were often built from existing assets and did not receive much respect or interest from consumers, and instead were generally made to be played and shared with other interested players and at conventions. Around 2013, market forces began to shift with the popularity of indie games in the Western regions, bringing more interest to d≈çjin games as legitimate titles. The Tokyo Game Show first offered a special area for d≈çjin games in 2013 with support from Sony Interactive Entertainment who had been a promoter of Western indie games in prior years, and has expanded that since. There still remains a distinction between Japanese-developed d≈çjin games and indie games: games in the long- running bullet hell series, the Touhou Project, are still considered d≈çjin games, while Cave Story is not only considered an indie game, but one of the most successful Japanese-produced ones, and which also contributed to the resurgences of the Metroidvania genre. D≈çjin games also got a strong interest in Western markets after some English-speaking groups translated various titles with permission for English release, most notably with Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, the first such d≈çjin to be published on Steam in 2010. Mikhail Fiadotau, a lecturer in video game studies at Tallinn University, identified three primary distinctions between the established d≈çjin culture and the Western idea of indie games. From a conceptual view, indie games generally promote independence and novelty in thought, while d≈çjin games tend to be ideas shared by a common group of people and tend to not veer from established concepts (such as strong favoritism towards the well-established RPG genre). From a genealogical standpoint, the nature of d≈çjin dates back as far as the 19th century, while the indie phenomena is relatively new. Finally, only until recently, d≈çjin games tended to only be talked about in the same circles as other d≈çjin culture (fan artwork and writing) and rarely mixed with commercial productions, whereas indie games have shared the same stage with AAA games.  Development  Many of the same basic concepts behind video game development for mainstream titles all apply to indie game development, particularly around the software development aspects. Key differences lie in how the development of the game ties in with the publisher or lack thereof. Development teams And Yet It Moves is an example of a student-developed game expanded to a commercial title following the team's graduation. There is no definitive size to how big an independent game development studio might be. Several successful indie games, including Axiom Verge, Cave Story, Papers, Please, and Spelunky, were all developed by a single person, though often with support of artists and musicians for those assets. More common are small teams of developers, from two to a few dozen, with additional support from external artists. While it is possible for development teams to be larger, there becomes a higher cost overhead of running the studio, which may be risky if the game does not perform well. Indie teams can arise from many different directions. One common path recently includes student projects, developed as prototypes as part of their coursework, which the students then take into commercial opportunity after graduating from school. Examples of such games include And Yet It Moves, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, Risk of Rain, and Outer Wilds. In some cases, students may drop out of school to pursue the commercial opportunity or for other reasons; Vlambeer's founders, for example, had started to develop a commercial game while still in school and dropped out when the school demanded rights to the game. Another route for indie development teams comes from experienced developers in the industry who either voluntarily leave to pursue indie projects, typically due to creative burnout from the corporate process, or resulting from termination from the company. Examples of games from such groups include FTL: Faster Than Light, Papers, Please, Darkest Dungeon, and Gone Home. Yet another route are simply those with little to no experience in the games industry, though may have computer experience skills, and come in with ideas and fresh perspectives for games, with ideas that are generally more personable and close to their heart. These developers are usually self-taught and thus may not have certain disciplines of typical programmers, allowing for more creative freedom and new ideas. However, some may see amateur work less favorably than those that have had experience, whether from school or from industry, relying on the game development toolkits rather than programming languages, and associate such titles as amateur or hobbyist. Examples of such amateur games include Braid, Super Meat Boy, Dwarf Fortress, and Undertale. Typically, a starting indie game studio will be primarily programmers and developers. Art assets including artwork and music can be outsourced to work-for-hire artists and composers. Development tools For development of personal computer games, indie games typically rely on existing game engines, middleware and game development kits to build their titles, lacking the resources to build custom engines. Common game engines include Unreal Engine and Unity, but there are numerous others as well. Small studios that do not anticipate large sales are generally afforded reduced prices for mainstream game engines and middleware. These produces may be offered free, or be offered at a substantial royalty discount that only increases if their sales exceed certain numbers. Indie developers may also use open source software and homebrew libraries, which are freely available but may lack technically-advanced features compared to equivalent commercial engines. Prior to 2010, development of indie games on consoles was highly restrictive due to costly access to software development kits (SDKs), typically a version of the console with added debugging features that would cost several thousands of dollars and come with numerous restrictions on its use to prevent trade secrets related to the console from being leaked. Console manufactures may have also restricted sales of SDKs to only certain developers that met specific criteria, leaving potential indie developers unable to acquire them. When indie games became more popular by 2010, the console manufacturers as well as mobile device operating system providers released special software-based SDKs to build and test games first on personal computers and then on these consoles or mobile devices. These SDKs were still offered at commercial rates to larger developers, but reduced pricing was provided to those who would generally self-publish via digital distribution on the console or mobile device's storefront, such as with the ID@Xbox program or the iOS SDK. Publishers While most indie games lack a publisher with the developer serving in that role, a number of publishers geared towards indie games have been established since 2010, also known as boutique game publishers; these include Raw Fury, Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive and Adult Swim Games. There also have been a number of indie developers that have grown large enough on their own to also support publishing for smaller developers, such as Chucklefish, Coffee Stain Studios, and Team17. These boutique publishers, having experience in making indie games themselves, typically will provide necessary financial support and marketing but have little to no creative control on developers' product as to maintain the \\"indie\\" nature of the game. In some cases, the publisher may be more selective of the type of games it supported; Annapurna Interactive sought games that were \\"personal, emotional and original\\". Funding The lack of a publisher requires an indie developer to find means to fund the game themselves. Existing studios may be able to rely on past funds and incoming revenue, but new studios may need to use their own personal funds (\\"bootstrapping\\"), personal or bank loans, or investments to cover development costs, or building community support while in development. More recently, crowd-funding campaigns, both reward-based and equity-based, have been used to obtain the funds from interested consumers before development begins in earnest. While using crowd-funding for video games took off in 2012, its practice has significantly waned as consumers became wary of campaigns that failed to deliver on promised goods. A successful crowd-funded campaign typically required significant development work and costs associated with before the campaign is launched to demonstrate that the game will likely be completed in a timely manner to draw in funds. Another mechanism offered through digital distribution is the early access model, in which interested players can buy playable beta versions of the game to provide software testing and gameplay feedback. Those consumers become entitled the full game for free on release, while others may have to pay a higher price for the final. This can provide funding midway though development, but like with crowd-funding, consumers expect a game that is near completion, so significant development and costs will have had to been invested already. Minecraft was considered an indie game during its original development, and was one of the first titles to successfully demonstrate this approach to funding. More recently, a number of dedicated investor-based indie game funds have been established such as the Indie Fund. Indie developers can submit applications requesting grants from these funds. The money is typically provided as a seed investment to be repaid through game royalties. Several national governments, through their public arts agencies, also have made similar grants available to indie developers. Distribution Prior to digital distribution, hobbyist programmers typically relied on mail order to distribute their product. They would place ads in local papers or hobbyist computer magazines such as Creative Computing and Byte and, once payment was received, fulfil orders by hand, making copies of their game to cassette tape, floppy disc, or CD-ROM along with documentation. Others would provide copies to their local computer store to sell. In the United Kingdom, where personal computer game development took off in the early 1980s, a market developed for game distributors that handled the copying and distribution of games for these hobbyist programmers. As the media shifted to higher-capacity formats and with the ability for users to make their own copies of programs, the simple mail order method was threatened since one person could buy the game and then make copies for their friends. The shareware model of distribution emerged in the 1980s accepting that users would likely make copies freely and share these around. The shareware version of the software would be limited, and require payment to the developer to unlock the remaining features. This approach became popular with hobbyist games in the early 1990s, notably with the releases of Wolfenstein 3D and ZZT, \\"indie\\" games from fledgling developers id Software and Tim Sweeney (later founder of Epic Games), respectively. Game magazines started to include shareware games on pack-in demo discs with each issue, and as with mail-order, companies arose that provided shareware sampler discs and served to help with shareware payment and redemption processing. Shareware remained a popular form of distribution even with availability of bulletin board systems and the Internet. By the 2000s, indie developers relied on the Internet as their primary distribution means as without a publisher, it was nearly impossible to stock an indie game at retail, the mail order concept having long since died out. Continued Internet growth led to dedicated video game sites that served as repositories for shareware and other games, indie and mainstream alike, such as GameSpy FilePlanet. A new issue had arise for larger mainstream games that featured multiplayer elements, in that updated and patches could easily be distributed through these sites but making sure all users were equally informed of the updates was difficult, and without the updates, some players would be unable to participate in multiplayer modes. Valve built the Steam software client originally to serve these updates automatically for their games, but over time, it became a digital storefront that users could also purchase games through. For indie games, Steam started curating third-party titles (including some indies) onto the service by 2005, later adding Steam Greenlight in 2012 that allowed any developer to propose their game for addition onto the service to the userbase, and ultimately replacing Greenlight with Steam Direct in 2017 where any developer can add their game to the service for a small fee. While Steam remains the largest digital storefront for personal computer distribution, a number of other storefronts have opened since, with Itch.io, established in 2013, more focused on serving indie games over mainstream ones, providing the develop with store pages and other tools to help with marketing. Others serve more as digital retailers, giving tools to the indie developer to be able to accept and redeem online purchases and distribute the game, such as Humble Bundle, but otherwise leaving the marketing to the developer. On consoles, the distribution of an indie game is handled by the console's game store, once the developer has been approved by the console manufacturer. Similarly for mobile, the distribution of the game is handled by the app store provider once the developer has been approved to release apps on that type of device. In either case, all aspects of payment, redemption and distribution are handled at the manufacturer/app store provider level. A recent trend for some of the more popular indies is a limited physical release, typical for console-based versions. The distributor Limited Run Games was formed to produce limited runs of games, most commonly successful indie titles that have a proven following that would have a market for a physical edition. These versions are typically produced as special editions with additional physical products like art books, stickers, and other small items in the game's case. In nearly all cases with digital distribution, the distribution platform takes a revenue cut of each sale with the rest of the sale going to the developer, as a means to pay for the costs of maintaining the digital storefront.  Industry  Most indie games do not make a significant profit, and only a handful have made large profits. Instead, indie games are generally seen as a career stepping stone rather than a commercial opportunity. The Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect has been shown to apply to indie games: some people with little experience have been able to develop successful games from the start, but for most, it takes upwards of ten years of experience within the industry before one regularly starts making games with financial success. Most in the industry caution that indie games should not be seen a financially-rewarding career for this reason. The industry perception towards indie games have also shifted, making the tactics of how to develop and market indie games difficult in contrast to AAA games. In 2008, a developer could earn around 17% of a game's retail price, and around 85% if sold digitally. This can lead to the appearance of more \\"risky\\" creative projects. Furthermore, the expansion of social websites has introduced gaming to casual gamers. Recent years have brought the importance of drawing social media influencers to help promote indie games as well. There is contention as to how prominent indie video game development is in the video game industry. Most games are not widely known or successful, and mainstream media attention remains with mainstream titles. This can be attributed to a lack of marketing for indie games, but indie games can be targeted at niche markets.  Community  The Independent Games Festival exposition during the 2013 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, where indie developers can showcase their games to attendees Indie developers are generally considered a highly collaborative community with development teams sharing knowledge between each other, providing testing, technical support, and feedback, as generally indie developers are not in any direct competition with each other once they have achieved funding for their project. Indie developers also tend to open with their target player community, using beta testing and early access to get feedback, and engaging users regularly through storefront pages and communication channels such as Discord. Indie game developers can be involved with various indie game trade shows, such as Independent Games Festival, held alongside the Game Developers Conference, and IndieCade held prior to the annual E3 convention. The Indie Megabooth was established in 2012 as a large showcase at various trade shows to allow indie developers to show off their titles. These events act as intermediaries between indie developers and the larger industry, as they present the abilities to connect with larger developers and publishers for business opportunities, as well as to get word of their games out to the press prior to release. Game jams, including Ludum Dare, the Indie Game Jam, the Nordic Game Jam, and the Global Game Jam, are typically annual competitions in which game developers are given a theme, concept and/or specific requirements and given a limited amount of time, on the order of a few days, to come up with a game prototype to submit for review and voting by judges, with the potential to win small cash prizes. Companies can also have internal game jams as a means to relief stress which may generate ideas for future games, as notably the case for Double Fine and its Amnesia Fortnights. The structure of such jams can influence whether the end games are more experimental or serious, and whether they are to be more playful or more expressive. While many game jam prototype go no further, some developers have subsequently expanded the prototype into a full release after the game jam into successful indie games, such as Superhot, Super Time Force, Gods Will Be Watching, Surgeon Simulator, and Goat Simulator. Impact Indie games are recognized for helping to generate or revitalize video game genres, bringing new ideas to either stagnant gameplay concepts or creating whole new experiences. The expansion of roguelikes from ASCII, tile-based hack-and-slash games to a wide variety of so-called \\"rogue-lites\\" that maintain the roguelike procedural generation and permadeath features bore out directly from indie games Strange Adventures in Infinite Space (2002) and its sequel Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space (2005), Spelunky (2008), The Binding of Isaac (2011), FTL: Faster Than Light (2012) and Rogue Legacy (2012). Metroidvanias resurged following the releases of Cave Story (2004) and Shadow Complex (2009). Art games have gained attention through indie developers with early indie titles such as Samorost (2003) and The Endless Forest (2005).

This occurred at a town meeting in the New England town of Uxbridge in Massachusetts Colony, on October 30, 1756. Early life Lydia Chapin was born in Mendon, Worcester County, Massachusetts on February 2, 1712. She was the daughter of Seth Chapin and Bethia Thurston. Seth Chapin was a respected member of the community and a captain in the militia.Crane p.221 Young Lydia grew up in Mendon, in a large family with nine siblings.Crane p.182 Her mother had 14 children.Crane p.181 Her father owned much property in what is today Milford, south Hopedale and Posts Lane in Mendon, and the family lived on near the Post's Lane bridge and Mill River. In 1727, the western part of Mendon became the newly incorporated town of Uxbridge. Mendon and Uxbridge were, at that time, rural communities in central Massachusetts. In 1731, these communities became part of the new county of Worcester County. By their mutual ancestor, Captain Seth Chapin, she was a great-great-great grand-aunt of the 27th United States President William Howard Taft, also his first cousin, four times removed, by marriage to Josiah Taft. By their mutual ancestor, Samuel Chapin, she was a second cousin, seven times removed, to celebrated songwriters and musicians Harry Chapin and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Marriage to Josiah Taft Lydia Chapin was married to Josiah Taft,Crane p.222 on December 28, 1731 at the Congregational Church in Mendon. He was born on April 2, 1709. Josiah's father Daniel, had been a local \\"squire\\" and Justice of the Peace. Lydia and Josiah settled in Uxbridge. They had eight children between 1732 and 1753: Josiah (born 10 May 1733), Ebenezer (born somewhere between 20 August 1735 and 16 October 1735), Caleb (born between 15 January 1739 and 19 September 1756), Asahel (born 23 April 1740), Joel (born between 15 August 1742 and 19 February 1747), Joel (born between 19 February 1748 and 30 August 1749), Bazaleel (born 3 November 1750), and Chloe (born 7 June 1753). Josiah became a prominent citizen in early Uxbridge as a wealthy farmer, local official, and Massachusetts legislator. He served several terms as a member of the Board of Selectmen, as town clerk, as town moderator, and in the Massachusetts General Court (1753). Place in early American history Josiah Taft was originally known as Ensign Josiah Taft in the Uxbridge Militia, and later as Lieutenant, and then Captain in the French and Indian War. He presided over the proceedings of the New England style open town meeting and became the largest taxpayer in the town of Uxbridge in 1756. In the fall of 1756, Josiah and Lydia's 18-year-old son, Caleb, became ill while studying at Harvard and died on September 19. After traveling to Cambridge to bury Caleb, Josiah himself became ill and died on September 30, at age 47‚Äîleaving behind a significant estate. His death was immediately prior to an important vote on the town's support for the French and Indian War. Josiah's untimely death opened the door for Lydia's step into America's history of women's suffrage. In Colonial America, women were not allowed to vote. Margaret Brent of Maryland Colony tried to assert property rights and to vote in 1647 on behalf of herself and Lord Calvert's estate, but this was denied by the Governor. Over a hundred years would pass before a woman succeeded in voting in an official capacity. The Uxbridge townspeople allowed Lydia, \\"the widow Josiah Taft\\", to vote, because of the landowner and taxpayer status of Josiah's estate and the fact that Bazaleel, Caleb's younger brother, was still a minor. Receiving his proxy, she thus became the first recorded legal woman voter in colonial America when she cast a vote on October 30, 1756 in an official New England Open Town Meeting, at Uxbridge, Massachusetts‚Äîas was noted in the records of the Uxbridge Town Meeting. Her vote was in favor of appropriating funds for the regiments engaged in the French and Indian War. Taft's historic vote preceded the constitutional amendment for women's suffrage by 164 years. She appeared at and may have voted at two other official Uxbridge Town meetings, in 1758 and 1765. Taft died at Uxbridge on November 9, 1778, at the age of 66, during the American Revolution. Many years later, Judge Henry Chapin proclaimed in an 1864 address to the Unitarian church, that, \\"Uxbridge may yet become famous as the pioneer in the cause of women's suffrage\\". According to Chapin, the decision to allow Taft to vote was following the tradition of \\"no taxation without representation\\". Chapin's claim for Taft as the first woman voter has been disputed by recent historians. They contend that historical documents do not support Chapin's story of his family's history, which was from a speech delivered over one hundred years after the event. Nonetheless, Taft's role in the history of women's suffrage has been recognized by the Massachusetts legislature since 2004, when it named Massachusetts Route 146A, from Uxbridge to the Rhode Island border, in her honor.http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw04/sl040056.htm See also *Taft family *Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution *Women's suffrage in the United States *Feminism in the United States *Timeline of women's suffrage References External links *The Chapin Genealogy, p. 226-227 * Photo of Painting: Lydia Chapin Taft Source:Find a grave Category:French and Indian War Category:1712 births Category:1778 deaths Category:People from Mendon, Massachusetts Category:People from Uxbridge, Massachusetts Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:Taft family Category:Women's suffrage in the United States ","title":"Lydia Taft"},{"id":"13056065","text":"Christos Kotsonis (born June 13, 1976 in Cyprus) is a Cypriot midfielder who plays for Anagennisi Dherynia.

The film was a success and Isa Miranda became a star. It was shot at the Cines Studios in Rome and on location in Como. Plot Gabriella Murge, alias Gaby Doriot (Miranda), is a famous film star and fascinating adventuress with whom men cannot help falling in love. Having brought several of them to their ruin, she slits her wrists . The movie opens with Gaby having attempted suicide. In the hospital, the anesthetic gas she is given induces the flashbacks which make up the entire movie. First, a young Gaby is expelled from her school when her music teacher falls in love with her, and then flees abroad, leaving his family. Later, after being confined to her home, she is invited to a party by Roberto Nanni, the son of the wealthy Leonardo Nanni, a businessman. At the party, they dance and Roberto falls in love with her. Their encounter is interrupted by Roberto's ill mother Alma, who is fearful of Gaby's reputation, but who eventually loves her as well. Gaby goes to their house to take care of Alma, and while Roberto goes on a trip to Rome, Leonardo falls in love with Gaby. One night, Leonardo invites Gaby to a private talk in the garden, and meanwhile, Alma, having put on music to go to bed, calls out for Gaby. Not hearing a response, Alma becomes frantic, and in desperation, falls down the stairs in her wheelchair, killing herself. After Alma's death, Leonardo and Gaby go on a seemingly endless trip across Europe, despite the calls of Leonardo's business associates to return, and when they finally return, Gaby is haunted by the memory of the house and goes crazy. Gaby leaves Leonardo, telling him he should be with his wife, even if she is dead, and soon after, Leonardo is charged with embezzlement and sentenced to 4 years in prison. Meanwhile, Gaby becomes a huge movie star. When released from prison, Leonardo wanders around the foyer of the theater, looking at all the images of Gaby, until being expelled for being improperly dressed for the occasion (not in evening attire). Outside, he's run over by a car. To avoid a scandal, Gaby's managers and entourage call in Roberto to exonerate her, and Gaby realizes that she's loved Roberto all along. Gaby then finds out the Roberto married her sister Anna, after meeting at the auction of his father's house. Gaby commits suicide, leaving a note detailing her loneliness that persisted through her stardom. At the end of the film, the anesthetic mask is removed, the doctors confirm her death, and the printing presses stop printing the poster for her film.

There is debate as to whether or not this channel is expressed in the cell surface membrane. This major protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes forms a voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) that behaves as a general diffusion pore for small hydrophilic molecules. The channel adopts an open conformation at low or zero membrane potential and a closed conformation at potentials above 30‚Äì40 mV. VDAC facilitates the exchange of ions and molecules between mitochondria and cytosol and is regulated by the interactions with other proteins and small molecules.  Structure  This protein contains about 280 amino acids and forms a beta barrel which spans the mitochondrial outer membrane. Since its discovery in 1976, extensive function and structure analysis of VDAC proteins has been conducted. A prominent feature of the pore emerged: when reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, there is a voltage- dependent switch between an anion-selective high-conductance state with high metabolite flux and a cation-selective low-conductance state with limited passage of metabolites. More than 30 years after its initial discovery, in 2008, three independent structural projects of VDAC-1 were completed. The first was solved by multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The second applied a hybrid approach using crystallographic data. The third was for mouse VDAC-1 crystals determined by X-ray crystallographic techniques. The three projects of the 3D structures of VDAC-1 revealed many structural features. First, VDAC-1 represents a new structural class of outer membrane Œ≤-barrel proteins with an odd number of strands. Another aspect is that the negatively charged side chain of residue E73 is oriented towards the hydrophobic membrane environment. The 19-stranded 3D structure obtained under different experimental sources by three different laboratories fits the EM and AFM data from native membrane sources and represents a biologically relevant state of VDAC-1.  Mechanism  At membrane potentials exceeding 30 mV (positive or negative), VDAC assumes a closed state, and transitions to its open state once the voltage drops below this threshold. Although both states allow passage of simple salts, VDAC is much more stringent with organic anions, a category into which most metabolites fall. The precise mechanism for coupling voltage changes to conformational changes within the protein has not yet been worked out, but studies by Thomas et al. suggest that when the protein transitions to the closed form, voltage changes lead to the removal of a large section of the protein from the channel and decrease effective pore radius. Several lysine residues, as well as Glu-152, have been implicated as especially important sensor residues within the protein.  Biological function  The voltage- dependent ion channel plays a key role in regulating metabolic and energetic flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is involved in the transport of ATP, ADP, pyruvate, malate, and other metabolites, and thus communicates extensively with enzymes from metabolic pathways. The ATP-dependent cytosolic enzymes hexokinase, glucokinase, and glycerol kinase, as well as the mitochondrial enzyme creatine kinase, have all been found to bind to VDAC. This binding puts them in close proximity to ATP released from the mitochondria. In particular, the binding of hexokinase is presumed to play a key role in coupling glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, VDAC is an important regulator of Ca2+ transport in and out of the mitochondria. Because Ca2+ is a cofactor for metabolic enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, energetic production and homeostasis are both affected by VDAC‚Äôs permeability to Ca2+.  Disease relevance  VDAC has also been shown to play a role in apoptosis. During apoptosis, VDAC modifies the Mitochondrial permeability transition pore to release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c. However, VDAC are not essential components of the Mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Although cyt. c plays an essential role in oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondrion, in the cytosol it activates proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which play a major role in cell death. Although the mechanism for VDAC-facilitated cyt. c release has not yet been fully elucidated, some research suggests that oligomerization between individual subunits may create a large flexible pore through which cyt. c can pass. A more important factor is that release of cyt c. is also regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family: Bax interacts directly with VDAC to increase pore size and promote cyt. c release, while anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL produces the exact opposite effect. In fact, it has been shown that antibodies that inhibit VDAC also interfere with Bax- mediated cyt. c release in both isolated mitochondria and whole cells. This key role in apoptosis suggests VDAC as a potential target for chemotherapeutic drugs.  Examples  Yeast contains two members of this family (genes POR1 and POR2); vertebrates have at least three members (genes VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3). Humans, like most higher eukaryotes, encode three different VDACs; VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3. Together with TOMM40 and TOMM40L they represent a family of evolutionarily related Œ≤-barrels. Plants have the largest number of VDACs. Arabidopsis encode four different VDACs but this number can be larger in other species.

Everything else in her genealogy is more or less uncertain. She is believed to have been a daughter of Boso of Lower Burgundy (Provence), and she is presumed to have been the mother of King Rudolf II of Upper Burgundy and Italy. These two kinships enjoy some indicative support from near-contemporary sources. The first-mentioned kinship would make her a sibling, at least half-sister, of Louis the Blind. The second would mean she were an ancestor of the last independent Burgundian royal house, and through it ancestor of last Ottonian emperors, of the last Carolingian king of France, of a number of dukes of Swabia, of the later Guelph dynasty, and of the Salian Imperial House, as well as of practically all European royal families since High Middle Ages. Queen Guilla's date of death, after 912 and before 924, is determined because of a charter (expressing her to be dead) dated in 924. After her death, in 926, her widower, Count Hugh, took over the kingdom of Italy from Rudolf II of Burgundy (who was either stepson or own son of Guilla).

It contained the hit songs \\"Diga Diga Do\\", the duo's first hit, \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\", \\"Bandanna Babies\\" and \\"I Must Have That Man\\" all sung by Hall. Hall on the front cover of the French edition of Vu (magazine),1929 History Blackbirds of 1928 was the idea of impresario Lew Leslie, who planned to build the show around Florence Mills in New York City after her success in the hit 1926 show Blackbirds in London. Mills died of appendicitis in 1927 before rehearsals for the new show had started and Hall was enlisted to replace her. Blackbirds of 1928 started its life as a floorshow at Les Ambassadeurs Club on 57th Street, New York with songs written by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields. Fields recalled,Pick Yourself Up: Dorothy Fields and the American Musical by Charlotte Greenspan, , page 62 & 63: https://www.amazon.com/Pick-Yourself-Up- American-Broadway/dp/B008SLIH76 ‚ÄòLew Leslie (the producer) hired us to do a show called Blackbirds of 1928. First, we‚Äôd written songs for a show of his in a club called Les Ambassadeurs, where we had Roger Wolfe Kahn (Otto Kahn‚Äôs son) and his orchestra, and a lovely lady named Adelaide Hall, who sang.‚Äô McHugh recalled, ‚ÄòI knew about Roger Wolfe Kahn wanting to close the club, and I told Lew Leslie, and Lew went up and made arrangements to take it over. This was the start of the show called Blackbirds of 1928. Leslie opened Les Ambassadeurs with the first half of the show.‚Äô The show was a great hit. McHugh continued, ‚ÄòFrom there we wrote a second half and we took the show to Atlantic City.‚Äô After the tryout in Atlantic City the show opened on Broadway. It was the first Broadway show for which Fields and McHugh had written the entire score and turned out to be a milestone in their respective careers and was one of the most successful shows they were ever connected with. Adelaide Hall in Blackbirds of 1928 Productions The show originally opened on January 4, 1928, under the heading The Blackbird Revue at Les Ambassadeurs Nightclub in New York, before transferring in May 1928 to the Liberty Theatre on Broadway,Playbill programme for Blackbirds of 1928 at the Liberty Theatre: http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/6579/Blackbirds-of-1928 where Lew Leslie changed the shows name to Blackbirds of 1928.

In that sense, making reference to the general package of financial agreements that typically represents cash yields that are paid to investors and that are supported by cash payments received from homeowners who pay interest and principal according to terms agreed to with their lenders; it is a funding instrument created by the \\"originator\\" or \\"sponsor\\" of the mortgage loan; without cross-collateralizing individual loans and mortgages (because it would be impossible to receive permission from individual homeowners), it is a funding instrument that pools the cash flow received from individuals and pays these cash receipts out with waterfall priorities that enable investors to become comfortable with the certainty of receipt of cash at any point in time. There are multiple important differences between mortgage loans originated and serviced by banks and kept on the books of the bank and a mortgage loan that has been securitized as part of an RMBS. Chief among these is the result that the principal who interacts with the borrower, and drives the decision making of the \\"Servicer\\" who is newly introduced into the relationship, no longer has an obligation towards the responsibilities associated with the public trust and banking charter that traditionally controlled the loan relationships between banks and their customers. Unless a loan is reconstituted onto the balance sheet of an original lender, the retail-to-consumer relationship between the borrower and his bank is changed to a relationship that is between the original customer and a sophisticated accredited investor for whom the bank Servicer acts as a front. An RMBS is often confusingly yet correctly referred to as a \\"bond-like\\" financial investment as a RMBS can be portrayed to have similar characteristics, including a \\"principal investment\\" and a \\"yield\\"; the \\"principal investment,\\" however, does not represent the purchase of an individual promissory note issued by a homeowner, but rather represents the payment of \\"principal\\" for the right to receive cash flow from an investment agreement that involves many other understandings. Likewise, the \\"yield\\" is only the calculation of an imputed interest yield that stems from the receipt of the cashflows. The RMBS market represents the largest source of funding of residential mortgage loans to US homeowners (see below). The performance of these securities has generally been considered more predictable than commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS),Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage- Backed Securities, Chapter 4 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). because of the large number of individual and geographically diversified loans that exist within any individual RMBS pool. There are many different types of RMBS, including mortgage pass-throughs, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapters 4 and 5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Origins The origins of modern residential mortgage-backed securities can be traced back to the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), although variations on mortgage securitization existed in the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s.Michael Simkovic, Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization In 1968, Ginnie Mae was the first to issue a new type of government-backed bond, known as the residential mortgage-backed security. This bond took a number of home loans, pooled the monthly principal and interest payments and then used the monthly cash flows as backing for the bond(s). The principal of these mortgages was guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, but not the risk that borrowers pay off the principal balance early or opt to refinance the loan, a set of possible future outcomes known as \\"prepayment risk.\\" Selling pools of mortgages in this way allowed Ginnie Mae to acquire new funds with which to buy additional home loans from mortgage brokers which furthered the agency's Congressionally mandated mission to \\"expand affordable housing\\". Because banks and other mortgage originators could sell their mortgages in an RMBS, they used the proceeds to make new mortgage loans.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage- Backed Securities, Chapter 1 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Because these bonds had the full faith and backing of the United States government, they received high credit ratings and \\"paid an interest rate that was only slightly higher than Treasury bonds.\\" Following the success of Ginnie Mae's offerings, the other two government-sponsored housing agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, began offering their own versions of RMBS. The government's guarantee of the mortgage loans assured investors that if the borrower defaulted, they would be repaid in full. But in return for that guarantee, borrowers were held to strict underwriting standards. For example, with Fannie Mae, homebuyers had to make a minimum down payment of 10 percent of the home value, and the buyer's income had to be well documented and preferably from a periodic salary.  Development of private-label MBSs subprime collapse. (source: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States, p.69 figure 5.1) In the late 1970s, a team from Salomon Brothers worked with Bank of America to create the first residential- mortgage backed security that wasn't government-guaranteed. A Salomon Brothers' bond-trader by the name of Lewis Ranieri was instrumental in this effort. He coined the term \\"securitizing\\" during this period after joining the project in 1977. According to author Alyssa Katz, Ranieri's ambition was to revolutionize the mortgage market, which at this time was heavily dependent on the government sponsored housing insurance institutions (Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). His plan was to discover a way to make the mortgage market a fully private affair and to bring that goal to a reality, his team wished to create a security product \\"that could be bought and sold among investors\\". The idea was to allow private banks to issue loans and then sell those loans to willing investors looking for a steady stream of income, freeing up capital with which the bank could then issue additional loans. Despite working on the project for three years, the bonds the Salomon team developed were a commercial failure due to various state regulations and federal securities laws dating back to the Great Depression To fix this problem, Ranieri helped create and defend before Congress the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984 (SMMEA). Alyssa Katz, in her 2009 book on the recent history of the American real estate market, writes that SMMEA > called on bond-rating agencies ‚Äî at the time, Moody‚Äôs and Standard & Poor‚Äôs > ‚Äî to weigh in on each mortgage pool. As long as a bond got one of the top > ratings from the agencies ‚Äî meaning that in the agencies‚Äô opinions, > investors ought to be confident of getting paid ‚Äî it could be sold. While > the Securities and Exchange Commission would oversee the trading of these > securities just as it did all investments for sale, no longer would the U.S. > government exclusively manage the market in mortgage-backed securities, as > it had through Ginnie Mae. ‚ÄúWe believe that the ratings services do offer > substantial investor protection,‚Äù Ranieri testified before Congress in early > 1984. This law opened up the door to allow \\"federally-charted financial institutions, including credit unions,\\" the ability to \\"invest in mortgage- related securities subject only to limitations that the appropriate regulating board might impose.\\" It created the market for the private label MBS that did not exist when Ranieri was first developing them in 1977. source: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States, p.73, figure 5.3 According to David Maxwell of Fannie Mae, the developers of \\"private-label\\" mortgage-backed securities did not seek to ‚Äî or at least end up ‚Äî undercutting and replacing the Fannie and Freddie's \\"agency\\" MBSs. They wanted \\"to find products they could profit from where they didn't have to compete with Fannie.\\" Financial journalists Bethany McLean, and Joe Nocera, argue Ranieri and others on Wall Street realized they would never \\"dislodge [GSEs] Fannie and Freddie from their dominant position as the securitizers of traditional mortgages,\\" but Fannie and Freddie had no business and no interest in non-prime mortgages (subprime or Alt-A mortgages). Thus the subprime market became the realm of private label Mortgage-Backed Securities.McLean, Bethany and Joe Nocera. All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis, Portfolio, Penguin, 2010 (p.19) Tranches The MBSs of the \\"government-sponsored enterprise\\", Fannie and Freddie were considered to be \\"the equivalent of AAA-rated bonds\\" because of their high standards and suggestions of guarantee by the US government. While private-label subprime mortgages would never be able to make that claim, by \\"slicing\\" the pooled mortgages into \\"tranches\\", each having a different priority in the stream of monthly or quarterly principal and interest stream, they could create triple A rated securities from the tranches with the highest priority ‚Äî the most \\"senior\\" tranches. Since the most senior tranche(s) was like a \\"bucket\\" being filled with the \\"water\\" of principal and interest that did not share this water with the next lowest bucket (i.e. tranche) until it was filled to the brim and overflowing,Here's how a CDO worksUpstart Business JournalDecember 5, 2007 the top buckets/tranches (in theory) had considerable creditworthiness and could earn the highest credit ratings, making them salable to money market and pension funds that would not otherwise deal with subprime mortgage securities. source: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States, p. 116 figure 7.2 The first private label deals in the late 1980s and early 1990 often had only two tranches, but by 2005‚Äì06 the deals became more complex. One \\"typical\\" mortgage-backed \\"deal\\" from one of the peak years of private label subprime mortgage securities (2006) was described in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report. (See table to the right.) Dubbed \\"CMLTI 2006-NC2\\", the deal involved 4499 subprime mortgages originated by New Century Financial‚Äîa California-based lender‚Äîand issued by a special purpose entity created and sponsored by Citigroup. The entity issued 19 tranches of mortgage- backed bonds worth $947 million. Since Citigroup and other firms focused on achieving high ratings, the (four) senior ranches rated triple A made up 78% or $737 million of the deal. Eleven tranches were \\"mezzanine\\" ‚Äì three rated AA, three A, three BBB and two BB (junk). The most junior tranche was known as \\"equity\\" or \\"residual\\" or \\"first loss\\". It had no credit rating and was split between Citigroup and a hedge fund. The more \\"junior\\" the tranche, the higher its risk and the higher its interest rate in compensation. According to business columnist Joe Nocera, as of mid-2013, \\"the market for private mortgage-backed securities ... remains moribund\\"[27]; its financing has become dominated by Fannie and Freddie.\\"an incredible 77 percent of the mortgages being made in America are guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie\\", The End of Fannie and Freddie?By JOE NOCERAnytimes.comJune 26, 2013 Growth, innovation, corruption Residential mortgage-backed securities and similar sounding products would continue to expand and become more complex throughout the 1980s. For example, in 1983 Freddie Mac marketed the first collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) Eventually structured finance would explode with the development of the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) in 1987 and even further inventions, like the CDO-Squared. CDOs were originally used to pool many different RMBSs (which were themselves pools of residential mortgages) and then divide them up into tranches and sell them off to investors. The end result of these financial innovations was a secondary mortgage market existing outside of the government-sponsored entities that provided a massive growth opportunity for Wall Street banks. According to former International Monetary Fund chief economist Simon Johnson, the \\"total volume of private mortgage- backed securities (excluding those issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) grew from $11 billion in 1984 to over $200 billion in 1994 to close to $3 trillion in 2007.\\" The private mortgage securitization market continued to grow. In 2004 the \\"commercial banks, thrifts, and investment banks caught up with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in securitizing home loans\\", and by 2005 they overtook them. Private MBS grew primarily by lowering their standards and securitizing more low-quality, high-risk mortgages such as Alt-A, and subprime mortgages. Scholar Michael Simkovic argues that this relaxation of standards was due to greater competition between securitizers for loans, and greater market power for loan originators. Financial journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera argue that Wall Street securitizers encouraged relaxation of standards because poor-quality loans \\"meant higher yields\\".quote= \\"Wall Street didn't care either. If anything, Wall Street was encouraging the subprime companies in their race to the bottom. Lousier loans meant higher yield.\\" (All the Devils Are Here, MacLean and Nocera, p. 217‚Äì18)quote=Wall Street \\"wanted the riskiest subprime mortgages ... because these ... generated the most yield.\\" \`While subprime loans cost borrowers much more in fees -- WaMu execs \\"noted subprime loans were roughly 7X more profitable than prime mortgages\\"\` (All the Devils Are Here, MacLean and Nocera, p. 134) GSEs also relaxed their standards in response, but GSE standards generally remained higher than private market standards, and GSE securitizations generally continued to perform well compared to the rest of the market. However, some believe the dominance of the GSEs distorted the market, leading to overpricing that helped lead to the real estate bubble and the ultimate federal government bailout of the GSEs. As a result, several legislative and other proposals for gradually winding down the GSEs have been developed.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 13 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Market collapse The very rapid growth in low- quality mortgages, financed through securitization, is widely believed to be a major cause of the late 2000s financial crisis, also known as the Subprime mortgage crisis. The private RMBS market largely collapsed after 2008 and has been replaced by government-backed securitization characterized by much tighter underwriting and higher standards.

It was written in 1957 by the Swiss army officer Hans von Dach to prepare the Swiss population for an occupation of Switzerland by Warsaw Pact forces, an eventuality then considered possible in the context of the Cold War. The book has been republished as pirated translations in dozens of languages in numerous countries abroad, and notably found use by left-wing terror groups in the 1960s and 70s. Publication Der totale Widerstand was first published in 1957 in seven volumes by the Swiss Non-Commissioned Officers' Association (Schweizer Unteroffiziersverband, SUOV) with an intent of broad dissemination to the Swiss population. The book was a commercial success, being reprinted five times and selling in the tens of thousands, notably in West Germany and Austria. It became by far the most well-known of von Dach's more than a hundred works on military tactics. Contents The book is a manual for irregular warfare against an occupying force, intended to be used by civilians rather than by soldiers. It presumes a form of irregular resistance involving no arms heavier than light infantry arms: rifles, hand grenades and mines. The topics covered in the first volume include: *the operative, tactical, technical and psychological basics of guerrilla warfare, such as sabotage, assassination and conduct under torture, *the establishment, organization and command of guerrilla warfare units and civilian resistance movements, *enemy methods of suppressing and combating guerrilla warfare. The other volumes describe the manufacture and use of basic weapons: chemical weapons (vol. 2), the Partisan 9mm submachine gun (vol. 3), the TARN pistol (vol. 4), improvised explosive devices (vol. 5), the TELL noise suppressor (vol. 6) and hand grenades (vol. 7). Reception In Switzerland While popular in the militia officer corps, the book was not well received by senior Army leaders, who favored a defence policy based on conventional combined-arms and mechanized warfare rather than irregular warfare. In 1974, the Chief of the General Staff vetoed the publication of Total Resistance as an army manual, partly because of concerns that it advocated conduct that violated the laws of war. When the Swiss Army did establish a secret stay-behind organization, P-26, in the 1970s, it was conceived as a top-down, cadre-led structure rather than the broad, decentralized civilian resistance movement envisioned by von Dach. Nonetheless, the book remains part of the curriculum of the Swiss Army Military Academy at the ETH Zurich as one of the \\"classics of the history of strategy and the theory of war.\\" Abroad The book soon found unexpected success abroad. In 1965, U.S. special forces published an unauthorized translation entitled Total Resistance ‚Äì Swiss Army Guide to Guerilla Warfare and Underground Operations. Other pirated translations continued to be published in dozens of languages in countries ranging from Angola to Vietnam. In the Soviet Union, the book was derided as \\"nonsense\\" in a 1984 newspaper article. Total Resistance became notably popular as an instruction manual for several left-wing terror groups active in the 1960s and 70s. According to Swiss and European police reports of the time, it was widely disseminated in left-wing extremist circles, and its tactics were used in bomb attacks in Southern Tyrol, New York and Frankfurt, as well as in unrests in Paris. For instance, in Italy, the publisher Savelli included part of the book in a left- wing political guerrilla handbook, In caso di golpe. Manuale teorico-pratico per il cittadino di resistenza totale e di guerra di popolo di guerriglia e di controguerriglia, in 1975. The book cover advertises the name of Hans von Dach with claim \\"Il manuale del maggiore von Dach\\". In Finland, the book was translated as Vastarintaopas by Pertti Riutta of the right-wing Itsen√§isyyden Puolesta organization in 1981. The book was intended to be handed out to trusted people to prepare for a possible Soviet invasion. The book was printed in secret by the French intelligence agency DGSE. Only ten were handed out before Finnish officials confiscated the books and Riutta and one of his associates was charged with espionage against the Soviet Union for France. In Germany, the book was often found in police searches, including with Red Army Faction members. Since 1988, Der totale Widerstand has been the only Swiss book whose distribution is restricted in Germany because it is indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons as \\"conducive to confusing the social ethics of children and young people, and to promote their inclination to violence\\".

From a prominent family of priests in the Fens, he was related to Oswald, Bishop of Worcester, Archbishop of York and founder of Ramsey Abbey. Following in the footsteps of his illustrious kinsman, he initially became a monk at Worcester. He is found at Ramsey supervising construction works in the 980s, and around 992 actually became Abbot of Ramsey. As abbot, he founded two daughter houses in what is now Cambridgeshire, namely, a monastery at St Ives and a nunnery at Chatteris. At some point between 1007 and 1009, he became Bishop of Dorchester, a see that encompassed much of the eastern Danelaw. He died at the Battle of Assandun in 1016, fighting Cnut the Great. Family Eadnoth the Younger was the son of √Üthelstan Mannessune by a kinswoman of Oswald, Bishop of Worcester and Archbishop of York.Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", pp. 49‚Äì50 His father came from family of hereditary Fenland priests from in or around the Isle of Ely. √Üthelstan had lands in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire, with \\"outlying\\" [Hart] estates in Norfolk and Lincolnshire.Hart, \\"Eadnoth I\\", p. 615 Eadnoth is styled \\"the Younger\\", Iunior, to distinguish him from Eadnoth \\"the Elder\\", Senior, the follower of Oswald who served as prior of the monastery of Ramsey in the years before Eadnoth the Younger became abbot.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, pp. xvii‚Äìxviii, xxv‚Äìxxvi Eadnoth the Younger had one brother, Godric (died 1013), and at least two sisters, √Ülfwaru (died 1007) and √Ülfwyn, all of whom inherited estates (in addition to a fishery) from their father.Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", pp. 49‚Äì51 Eadnoth, by contrast, became a monk at Worcester Abbey, where his mother's kinsman Oswald was bishop, and thus could not inherit anything.Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", p. 51 Eadnoth appears for the first time in the 980s when, according to the Liber Benefactorum Ecclesiae Ramesiensis, he supervised the repair of the western tower of Ramsey Abbey.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, pp. xxv‚Äìxxvi Eadnoth became Abbot of Ramsey in 992,Lapidge, \\"Abbot Germanus\\", p. 409; Knowles, Brook and London, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 61, give 993 having probably already taken over Eadnoth the Elder's duties as prior from at least 991, if not earlier.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, p. 180, n. 144 Abbot of Ramsey The Liber Benefactorum calls Eadnoth the Younger the \\"first abbot of Ramsey\\".Lapidge, \\"Abbot Germanus\\", pp. 409, 413; Sandler, \\"Historical Miniatures\\", p. 607; Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", p. 51; some other modern authorities list Oswald and Germanus as his predecessors in this office, as in Knowles, Brook and London, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 61 It says that he was elected according to the Benedictine Rule by the monks of Ramsey, after Ealdorman √Üthelwine had given Germanus enough money to found a new monastery at Cholsey.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, pp. 64‚Äì65, n. 58; see also Lapidge, \\"Abbot Germanus\\", p. 409, nn. 94‚Äì96 Ramsey had had two communities of monks, those who had been moved by Oswald there from Westbury on Trym in the 960s, and those who had fled there in the 980s from Winchcombe because of the anti- monastic reaction in Mercia; until 992, Oswald, who died in 992, had been titular abbot of the former with Eadnoth the Elder as his prior, while the Winchcombe monks had Germanus as their abbot.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, pp. 64‚Äì65, n. 58 According to historian Cyril Hart, \\"there is no shred of doubt\\" that Eadnoth the Younger obtained this office through the influence of Oswald.Hart, \\"Eadnoth\\", p. 621 Although such nepotism contradicted the usual spirit of the Benedictine revival in England at the time, Oswald himself had similarly advanced because of family connections. As abbot Eadnoth founded a nunnery on his family lands at Chatteris, and his younger sister √Ülfwyn became its first abbess.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, pp. 180‚Äì81, n. 144; Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", pp. 51‚Äì52 In 1007, the Chatteris nunnery received the lands of Over and Barley, following the death of their sister √Ülfwaru.Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", pp. 51‚Äì52 Eadnoth also founded a monastery at St Ives, Cambridgeshire. Established as a daughter-house of Ramsey (like Chaterris), the monastery's entire endowment consisted of Slepe (what became St Ives) as well as part of Elsworth and Knapworth.Hart, \\"Eadnoth I\\", pp. 617‚Äì18 All of these lands (including their churches) had been the property of Eadnoth's father √Üthelstan. Elsworth had been left to Ramsey in the will of Eadnoth's sister √Ülfwaru. On 24 April 1002, soon after founding St Ives, he translated its eponymous saintly resident‚Äîdiscovered by a ploughing peasant a year before‚Äîto Ramsey Abbey.Lapidge (ed.), Byrhtferth, pp. 180‚Äì81, n. 144 Bishop of Dorchester At some point between 1007 and 1009, Eadnoth became Bishop of Dorchester.Wareham, \\"St Oswald's Family\\", p. 52, gives 1008, while Lapidge, \\"Abbot Germanus\\", p. 409; Lapidge, Byrhtferth, pp. 180‚Äì81, n. 144, and Keynes, Atlas, Table LXb (1 of 2), shows that it was no earlier than 1007 and no later than 1009 Dorchester was a sprawling diocese based far to the south of most of its territory in the eastern Danelaw, at Dorchester on Thames.Hill, Atlas, pp. 147‚Äì148 It was roughly equivalent to the pre-Viking east Mercian diocese of Leicester, and after Eadnoth's episcopate came to include the Diocese of Lindsey too.Hill, Atlas, p. 148; Whitelock, \\"Dealings\\", pp. 74‚Äì75 In the Norman era the bishopric's seat returned north and became the well-known bishopric of Lincoln.Fryde, Greenway and Porter, Handbook of British Chronology, p. 255 Little is known of Eadnoth's episcopate. His first appearance as bishop is as a witness to a charter of 1009, issued by King √Üthelred to a thegn named Morcar; the last notice of Eadnoth's predecessor as bishop, √Ülfhelm, occurs in a similar document of 1007.; ; Keynes, Atlas, Table LXb (1 of 2); Lapidge, Byrhtferth, pp. 180‚Äì81, n. 144 Eadnoth subsequently subscribes at least another eight royal charters before his death, all between 1011 and 1013, with a possible further subscription in 1016.; ; ; ; ; ; , plus two unlisted by Sawyer; Keynes, Atlas, Table LXb (2 of 2) On 18 October 1016, Bishop Eadnoth fought and was martyred at the Battle of Assandun in Essex, alongside Wulfsifge, his successor as abbot of Ramsey, and √Üthelweard son of Ealdorman √Üthelwine [of East Anglia].Lawson, Cnut, p. 117; Whitelock (ed.), English Historical Documents, p. 250 He was fighting on behalf of Edmund Ironside against Cnut, the Danish invader who was claiming the English crown.Lawson, Cnut, p. 28 Eadnoth's body was taken north into the Fenlands, heading back to Ramsey. According to the Liber Eliensis, the guards of the body stopped at Ely Abbey and got drunk, during which the Ely monks seized and hid the body.Blair, \\"Handlist\\", pp. 528‚Äì29; Fairweather (ed.), Liber Eliensis, p. 169 The plot was led by √Ülfgar, formerly Bishop of Elmham. Thereafter the body remained at Ely, where Eadnoth the Martyr was venerated as a saint.

The nuclear pore complex is a massive structure embedded in the nuclear envelope at sites where the inner and outer nuclear membranes fuse, forming a gateway that regulates the flow of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nuclear pores enable the passive and facilitated transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope. Nucleoporins, a family of around 30 proteins, are the main components of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells. Nucleoporin 62 is the most abundant member of this family. Nucleoporins are able to transport molecules across the nuclear envelope at a very high rate. A single NPC is able to transport 60,000 protein molecules across the nuclear envelope every minute.  Function  Nucleoporins mediate transport of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotes. Certain members of the nucleoporin family form the structural scaffolding of the nuclear pore complex. However, nucleoporins primarily function by interacting with transport molecules known as karyopherins, also known as Kaps These karyopherins interact with nucleoporins that contain repeating sequences of the amino acids phenylalanine (F) and glycine (G) FG peptide repeats. In doing so, karyopherins are able to shuttle their cargo across the nuclear envelope. Nucleoporins are only required for the transport of large hydrophilic molecules above 40 kDa, as smaller molecules pass through nuclear pores via passive diffusion. Nucleoporins play an important role in the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after transcription. Depending on their function, certain nucleoporins are localized to either the cytosolic or nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. Other nucleoporins may be found on both sides. It has been recently shown that FG nucleoporins have specific evolutionary conserved features encoded in their sequences that provide insight into how they regulate the transport of molecules through the nuclear pore complex (NPC).  Structure  Nucleoporins aggregate to form a nuclear pore complex, an octagonal ring that traverses the nuclear envelope. The ring consists of eight scaffold sub-complexes, with two structural layers of COPII-like coating sandwiching some proteins that line the pore. From the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm, the three layers of the ring complex is named the cytoplasm, inner pore, and nucleoplasm rings respectively. Different sets of proteins associate on either ring, and some transmembrane proteins anchor the assembly to the lipid bilayer. In a scaffold subcomplex, both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm rings are made up of Y-complexes, a protein complex built out of, among others, NUP133 and NUP107. On each end of each of the eight scaffolds are two Y-complexes, adding up to 32 complexes per pore. The relationship of the membrane curvature of a nuclear pore with Y-complexes can be seen as analogous to the budding formation of a COPII coated vesicle. The proteins lining the inner pore make up the NUP62 complex. On the nucleoplasm side, extra proteins associated with the ring form \\"the nuclear basket\\", a complex capable of tethering the nucleoporin to the nuclear lamina and even to specific parts of the genome. The cytoplasmic end is less elaborate, with eight filaments projecting into the cytoplasm. They don't seem to have a role in nuclear import. Membrane nucleoporins associate with both the scaffold and the nuclear membrane. Some of them, like GP210, cross the entire membrane, others (like NUP98) act like nails with structural parts for the lining as well as parts that punch into the membrane. NUP98 was previously thought to be a FG-nucleoporin, until it was demonstrated that the \\"FG\\" in it have a coiled-coil fold. Some nucleoporins contain FG-repeats. Named after phenylalanine and glycine, FG-repeats are small hydrophobic segments that break up long stretches of hydrophilic amino acids. These flexible parts form unfolded, or disordered segments without a fixed structure. They form a mass of chains which allow smaller molecules to diffuse through, but exclude large hydrophilic macromolecules. These large molecules are only able to cross a nuclear pore if they are accompanied by a signaling molecule that temporarily interacts with a nucleoporin's FG-repeat segment. FG-nucleoporins also contain a globular portion that serves as an anchor for attachment to the nuclear pore complex. Nucleoporins have been shown to form various subcomplexes with one another. The most common of these complexes is the nup62 complex, which is an assembly composed of NUP62, NUP58, NUP54 and NUP45. Another example of such a complex is the Y (NUP107-160) complex, composed of many different nucleoporins. The NUP107-160 complex has been localized to kinetochores and plays a role in mitosis.  Evolution  Many structural nucleoporins contain solenoid protein domains, domains consisting of repeats that can be stacked together as bulk building blocks. There are beta-propeller domain with similarities to WD40 repeats, and more interestingly, unique types of alpha solenoid (bundles of helixes) repeats that form a class of their own, the ancestral coatomer elements (ACE). To date, two classes of ACEs have been identified. ACE1 is a 28-helix domain found in many scaffolding nucleoproteins as well as SEC31, a component of COPII. ACE2, shown in the infobox, is found in yeast Nup157/Nup170 (human Nup155) and Nup133. In either case, the shared domains, like their names suggest, indicate a shared ancestry both within nucleoproteins and between nucleoproteins and cotamers. All living eukaryotes share many important components of the NPC, indicating that a complete complex is present in their common ancestor. Transport mechanism Nucleoporins regulate the transport of macromolecules through the nuclear envelope via interactions with the transporter molecules karyopherins. Karyopherins will bind to their cargo, and reversibly interact with the FG-repeats in nucleoporins. Karyopherins and their cargo are passed between FG-repeats until they diffuse down their concentration gradient and through the nuclear pore complex. Karyopherins can serve as an importin (transporting proteins into the nucleus) or an exportin (transporting proteins out of the nucleus). Karyopherins release of their cargo is driven by Ran, a G protein. Ran is small enough that it can diffuse through nuclear pores down its concentration gradient without interacting with nucleoporins. Ran will bind to either GTP or GDP and has the ability to change a karyopherin's affinity for its cargo. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP causes an importin karyopherin to change conformation, allowing its cargo to be released. RanGTP can also bind to exportin karyopherins and pass through the nuclear pore. Once it has reached the cytosol, RanGTP can be hydrolyzed to RanGDP, allowing the exportin's cargo to be released. Pathology Several diseases have been linked to pathologies of nucleoporins, notably diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of the genes that encode for different nucleoporins also have been shown to be related to the formation of cancerous tumors. Nucleoporins have been shown to be highly sensitive to glucose concentration changes. Therefore, individuals affected by diabetes often exhibit increased glycosylation of nucleoporins, particularly nucleoporin 62. Autoimmune conditions such as anti-p62 antibodies, which inhibit p62 complexes have links to primary biliary cirrhosis which destroys the bile ducts of the liver. Decreases in the production of the p62 complex are common to many neurodegenerative diseases. Modification of the p62 promoter by oxidation is correlated with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease among other neurodegenerative disorders. Increased expression of the NUP88 gene, which encodes for nucleoporin 88, is commonly found in precancerous dysplasias and malignant neoplasms.\\"Entrez Gene: NUP88 nucleoporin 88kDa\\" Nucleoporin protein aladin is a component of the nuclear pore complex. Mutations in the aladin gene are responsible for triple-A syndrome, an autosomal recessive neuroendocrinological disease. Mutant aladin causes selective failure of nuclear protein import and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. The import of DNA repair proteins aprataxin and DNA ligase I is selectively decreased, and this may increase the vulnerability of the cell's DNA to oxidative stress induced damages that trigger cell death.

His predecessor was living and had been irregularly deprived, and Freeman suggests that the record of this fact in the chronicle may indicate some feeling against Wulfwig's appointment, but there seems to have been no opposition. Wulfwig apparently shared the scruple about the canonical position of Archbishop Stigand, for he went abroad to be consecrated. His appointment is thought to mark a momentary decline in Norman influence, and he was the last of the old line of Dorchester bishops, for his death occurred when the English ecclesiastical preferments were passing into Norman hands.

It was a broadly conservative grouping dedicated to preserving Breton cultural identity and regional independence. It expressed the ideology of mainly middle-class and aristocratic groups to secure continuity in local administration and Breton culture. Origins R√©gis de l'Estourbeillon dressed in Breton costume at the Celtic Congress of Caernarfon, 1904.The Union was created in August 1898, in Morlaix, following festivals devoted to Breton culture. It was chaired by Anatole Le Braz, with the Marquis de Estourbeillon. Fran√ßois Vall√©e was named president of the section dedicated to Breton language and literature, with Fran√ßois Jaffrenou as secretary. Other important figures were the writers Alphonse de Chateaubriant, Louis Tiercelin and Charles Le Goffic. The photographer and publisher √âmile Hamonic was also a member. Sympathisers, if not supporters, included the politician Albert de Mun, the poet and art critic Jean Le Fustec, the linguist and grammarian Fran√ßois Vall√©e, the composer Louis Bourgault-Ducoudray, the singer Th√©odore Botrel, the scholar Rene de Kerviler, the composer Guy Ropartz and many others. The prominent position held by the nobility and the clergy quickly alienated some of the more radical members and led to the foundation of the alternative Association des bleus de Bretagne (Blues of Brittany) in 1899, which had a more liberal-progressive agenda. Nevertheless, the two groups were never in open conflict. Le Braz was a member of both. The URB declared socialism to be its enemy. Jean-Marie D√©guignet, in his Memoirs of a Breton Peasant, wrote that the group was dominated by 'nobles and clerics' who wanted no input from the lower classes about their own culture. Gorsedd The Gorsedd of Brittany in 1906As a result of the group's work, the Gorsedd of Brittany was created August 31, 1900 in Guingamp, following a meeting of the URB. Following Welsh examples, the group sought to revive Celtic bardic traditions. Each participant adopted a pseudonym and the title of bard. The members of Gorsedd promoted Breton culture either in the sections of the URB, or in the Gorsedd itself. This produced the Ti Kaniri breiz (House of Breton Song). Later activities In 1912, Maurice Duhamel left the URB with Emile Masson, Camille Le Mercier d'Erm, Fran√ßois Vall√©e and Loeiz Herrieu to create the Breton Regionalist Federation. Le Mercier d'Erm and Masson went on to found the Breton Nationalist Party Yann Fou√©r√© was its vice-president from 1939 to 1945. After 1940, several of its members took part in \\"Sao Breiz\\", the Breton section of de Gaulle's Free French forces. A bulletin edited by the Marquis of Estourbillon appeared from 1902 to 1943.

The song is written by Jay-Z, Eminem, and Luis RestoDecoded by Jay Z and produced by and features Eminem, who is the only guest appearance on the album with rap verses. It was originally a collaboration between Eminem and Royce da 5'9\\" as part of the Bad Meets Evil series, but Royce was later replaced by Jay-Z.Royce Da 5'9 on Eminem Lab The original can be found on mixtapes and has been leaked onto the internet. The Jay-Z version of the song, released in 2001 as featured on The Blueprint, was later included as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of Eminem's 2005 greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits. Background The song is referenced by rapper Nas on his famous diss record Ether made during their highly publicized feud. Nas says to Jay-Z that \\"Eminem murdered you on your own shit;\\" stating that he felt Eminem outperformed Jay-Z on Jay's own song. Years later Jay admitted the Nas claim in \\"A Star Is Born\\". Nas and Jay-Z had both contributed to the soundtrack of Eminem's 2002 film 8 Mile, with Nas' contribution, \\"U Wanna Be Me\\", being a diss towards Jay-Z. Rapper The Game made reference to the Nas verse on Ether, on his own song with Eminem, \\"We Ain't\\", in satire by stating \\"Lo, get Dre on the phone quick Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit\\". Song meaning The song has different meanings to both artists. Jay-Z's two verses deal with his fatherless childhood, and how financial difficulties faced by his mother forced him to sell drugs for survival (thus becoming a renegade to society). He states his demeanor was \\"30 years [his] senior,\\" implying that hardships he faced during his childhood forced him to grow up and make adult decisions from a young age. Jay-Z argues that his music is the product of his rough upbringing, and that it speaks to others going through the same problems. Thus, he dismisses critics who lump him together with artists who only rap about \\"jewels\\". He accuses these critics of simply \\"skimming\\" through his music, instead of listening thoroughly. On the other hand, Eminem deals with the public perception of his music. At the time, Eminem was at the center of many criticisms due to the content of his lyrics. His references to drug use and religion caused many parents to publicly denounce his music. Eminem sees this outcry as hypocritical, claiming that these parents are using him as a \\"media scapegoat\\" to deflect attention away from their own shortcomings as parents. Jay-Z's first verse was used as a demo verse for Eminem's verse on the song \\"Dead Wrong\\". Both of his verses are to state that Eminem and he are liable to kill if the need is felt. Ultimately, both Jay-Z and Eminem use the hook to say that, while they may face public disapproval for different reasons, they will not change their behavior and have \\"never been afraid to talk about anything\\".

CRE Finance focuses on six Forums, market constituencies that encompass the commercial mortgage industry. These Forums include Investment-Grade Bondholders, Issuers, Multifamily Lenders, Securities and Loan Investors, Portfolio Lenders and Servicers. CRE Finance Council represents more than 300 member companies. The CRE Finance Council is headquartered in New York City's financial district at 30 Broad Street. History Commercial Mortgage Securities Association. It changed its name on March 23, 2010 to CRE Financial Council. Along with its name change, CRE Finance Council expanded its membership and focus and added six Forums, market constituencies that encompass the commercial mortgage industry.  The Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities Industry  Commercial mortgage-backed securities are bonds offered to investors that are collateralized by a pool of commercial mortgage loans from which all of the principal and interest paid on those mortgages flows to investors. To create these investment vehicles, mortgage loans of varying dollar amounts, property type, and location ‚Äîand containing a myriad of individualized terms and conditions ‚Äî are pooled and transferred to a trust. Bonds then are issued backed by the pool of assets held in the trust. Those bonds vary in yield (the amount of return on the bonds), duration (the length of time before the bond is expected to be paid off), and payment priority (the order in which investors are paid a return on their investment). Borrowers, lenders, and investors all benefit from CMBS. Borrowers often benefit via access both to larger pools of capital than would otherwise be available in traditional lending markets and to lower interest rates. Lenders benefit from CMBS because the securitization enables them to access the capital markets with their loan products and to obtain new bonds to make new loans. Investors benefit because CMBS creates a potentially attractive and credit-worthy investment vehicle that caters to their desired risk profile, investment term, and yield. Commercial Mortgage Securities Association is an international trade association dedicated to improving the liquidity of commercial real estate debt securities through access to the capital markets.

The Expo Center provides of column-free space under a cable- suspended roof. The building spans 448,400 total square feet on two levels, connected by side ramps and stairs, allowing for a variety of show floor plans.  History  The Golden Driller The Expo Center, originally called the International Petroleum Exposition Center (and often called the IPE Building), was funded by a $3.5 million bond issue in 1966, and upon completion became home to the International Petroleum Exposition. At the time of its completion, it was the world's largest building under a single roof. Standing in front of the Expo Center is the Golden Driller which was added as a symbol of the International Petroleum Exposition in 1966. Weighing 43,500 pounds and standing tall, the Golden Driller has become the symbol of Expo Square and a Tulsa landmark. Design of the building was performed by David R. Graham and Associates of Tulsa. Team members included engineers David R. Graham, C.E.C, Melvin L. Sedlacek, C.E.C. and architect Bert E. Griffin, A.I.A. Sedlacek and Griffin received a second-place award from The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation in 1966 for their design paper submission. Their paper dealt with the unique method of framing the structure, whereby the roof is suspended with cables, such as used in bridge construction but rarely seen in buildings. In July 2007 the building was renamed the QuikTrip Center, after Tulsa's QuikTrip Corporation paid $2.6 million as part of a reported 10-year naming rights agreement. In November 2012 it was reported that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation had agreed to buy the naming rights for the building commencing in 2013, as part of a deal that would have also seen the end of horse racing at Expo Square's Fair Meadows Race Track. Several weeks later, however, the Fair Board voted to reconsider the decision and reinstate racing, which also had the effect of putting the new naming deal on hold.  Events  The 2008 Wanenmacher Gun Show inside Expo Center. The building hosts many events throughout the year such as the Tulsa boat show, the Wanenmacher gun show (the largest gun show in the world), and Daryl Starbird's custom car show. During the Tulsa State Fair the largest facility is the Expo Center where vendors and exhibit booths line the entire floor, providing both educational and commercial services. The Chili Bowl midget car race is held each January in a clay track inside the center. The event attracts NASCAR and USAC drivers from around the country. Since 1998, the building has hosted the American Bicycle Association's annual Grand National Championships, a major event for BMX bikers.

He was appointed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on September 1, 2007, succeeding Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi. According to a September 2, 2007, report by Radio Free Europe, Radio Farda has described Jafari has been close to the conservative subfaction, which includes Mohsen Rezaee, the secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council and former commander of the IRGC and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a former IRGC member and the mayor of Tehran. The replacement of Safavi was thought to be a move to strengthen the conservative faction as a counterweight to the radicalizers around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whom Safavi is close to. \\"Observers appear to regard Jafari as principally a tactician, organizer, and 'technical' military man,\\" according to Radio Free Europe. The EU's official journal said the three Iranian Revolutionary Guard members, Jafari, General Qasem Soleimani, and the Guard's deputy commander for intelligence, Hossein Taeb, were now subject to sanctions and had been \\"providing equipment and support to help the Syrian regime suppress protests in Syria\\". Biography Jafari was born in Yazd and completed his primary and secondary education there. In 1977 he was admitted to Tehran University, where he studied civil (construction) technology. As a student he participated in anti- Shah protests in Tehran, and was arrested and sent to jail for this. He represented his university department in the Islamic Organization of Tehran University. At the start of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War Jafari fought with the Basij paramilitary force. In 1981 he became a part of the Revolutionary Guards where he rose to serve as a commander of operative battlefields of south and west. He also participated as an assistant in the operation of Susangerd, and served as commander of the Ashura Battalion, as well as of the Garrisons of Qods and Najaf. After the war Jafari returned to university to complete his education, and in 1992 he received a degree in civil (construction) technology. In 1992 and 1993, he taught at the War University of the Revolutionary Guards. He was appointed to head \\"a strategic research center to map out new defensive and military strategies in response to what Iran's leadership has seen as evolving threats in the Middle East\\", according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Jafari is said to have formed many of his ideas on unconventional, or asymmetric warfare at the research center. Prior to his appointment as leader of the guards, he was also the commander of Sarallah Garrison in Tehran. In 1999, according to Radio Farda, Jafari was among 24 IRGC commanders who signed a letter to President Mohammad Khatami, warning him that his liberalizing policies at a time of civil unrest in Tehran, threatened the country's leadership. Jafari is a brother-in-law of Mohammad Bagher Zolqadr, a former deputy interior minister. Asymmetrical warfare knowledge and ties to Iraq Jafari's work on asymmetrical warfare strategies include the use of Iranian terrain in mobile-defensive operations and rely on lessons and experiences learned in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Jafari said in Tehran on September 3, 2007, given \\"the enemy's\\" numerical or technological superiority, the IRGC would use asymmetrical warfare capabilities such as those used by Hezbollah in its 2006 conflict with Israel in Lebanon. Iranian strategy would also reflect the strengths and weaknesses of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said. On September 2, 2007, Radio Farda reported Jafari has extensive fighting experience and reportedly close relations with the commanders of the former Badr Brigades of the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).

Clinically, it has been shown to be effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea. Cefodizime is a bactericidal antibiotic that targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1A/B, 2, and 3 resulting in the eventual death of the bacterial cell. In vivo experimental models of infection showed that bacterial clearance by this drug is at least as effective compared with other 3rd generation cephalosporins. It has similar adverse effect profile to other 3rd generation cephalosporins as well, mainly being limited to gastrointestinal or dermatological side effects. It is not currently approved by the FDA for use in the United States.  Efficacy and susceptibility  Cefodizime demonstrated superior clinical efficacy that what could be predicted from its in vitro experimental results. Certain immunomodulatory properties of the drug might account for its increased in vivo activity against specific bacterial species. These immunomodulatory properties stimulate some phagocyte and lymphocyte cellular functions when they have been impaired. It was shown in a 2004 study that cefodizime increased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in neutrophils stimulated by Klebsiella pneumoniae infection which then affected the production of cytokines in the stimulated cells. A 1992 study conducted in vitro susceptibility studies for cefodizime and found that gram negative bacteria with consistent susceptibility include: Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. In vitro susceptible gram positive bacteria include: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Cefodizime was shown to be ineffective in vitro against Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Gram positive bacteria it was inactive against include Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus. In this trial, bacteria were considered susceptible if 90% or more of the strains were inhibited by cefodizime concentrations of at least 8 mg/L in vitro.  Pharmacokinetics  Intramuscular cefodizime bioavailability ranges from 90% to 100%. It distributes into many tissues and is approximately 81% bound to plasma proteins, chiefly albumin. The drug reaches minimum inhibitory concentrations approximately 2‚Äì3 hours after administration, maintaining it for several hours afterwards. Clearance of cefodizime from the body is predominantly renal, with the majority of the drug excreted unchanged within the first 12 hours. More specifically, cefodizime is mainly cleared via glomerular filtration in the kidney, in addition to some tubular secretion. In patients with normal renal function, the terminal phase elimination half-life is approximately 3.5 hours.  Adverse effects  Cefodizime has been shown to be generally well tolerated in drug trials and its adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal or dermatological. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in 2.4% of patients during clinical trials and included: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and elevated transaminases. Allergic symptoms were observed in 1.1% of patients and include: exanthema, urticaria, and pruritus. Other adverse effects observed include local site reactions, pain at site of injection, and phlebitis.  Administration  Cefodizime is available as an intramuscular injection or as an intravenous bolus or infusion and is usually given 1 or 2 times a day. In clinical trials, the most frequently used adult dosages ranged from 2 grams to 4 grams IM or IV per day given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses.

Life and career The Desbarats were an established printing family. The first of the family to settle was Joseph Desbarats from Auch in France, and who arrived in with the R√©giment de la Sarre in New France in 1756. Joseph's son Pierre-√âdouard co-purchased the Nouvelle Imprimi√®re (New Printing Office) from William Vondenvelden in 1798; the printer was responsible for printing the Lower Canadian Statutes, and also published newspapers such as the Quebec Mercury and other publications. Pierre-√âdouard's third son George-Paschal Desbarats took over the business in 1828 and was named Queen's Printer in 1841. George-√âdouard was born to George- Paschal and his first wife Henriette, daughter of Amable Dionne. He was sent to College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, 1846. He studied law at the Universit√© Laval, and was called to the bar of Lower Canada on 2 May 1859. In 1860 he married Lucianne (Lucie-Anne) Boss√©, who was the eldest daughter of Joseph-No√´l Boss√©. They had two daughters and five sons together. On his father's death Desbarats became co-Queen's Printer with Malcolm Cameron for the Province of Canada. Desbarats had the Desbarats Block building constructed in Ottawa when the city was chosen as capital of the newly confederated Dominion of Canada. The building housed printing and binding equipment and employed up to a hundred people. Numerous government publications were among the works published there. It was burned down by arson in 1869; among the losses were the lithographic plates for a scholarly on Samuel de Champlain that his grandson Peter Desbarats stated was to have been his \\"monument as a publisher\\". Prime Minister John A. Macdonald made Desbarats the first official printer of the Dominion of Canada that year; this made him an official government employee, as per the Act Respecting the Office of the Queen's Printer and the Public Printing effected 1 October 1869. He stepped down the next year when he found it too difficult to run businesses in both Ottawa and Montreal; he then returned to Montreal. Canadian Illustrated News, 14 August 1880, front-cover illustration by Henri Julien Desbarats and Leggo were responsible for a number of pioneering printing, including the photoelectrotyping process Leggotype, the first halftone photography reproduction in commercial printing, and photolithographic techniques at a time when the technology was still rare. They employed these techniques when they published the Canadian Illustrated News from 1869 to 1883, which printed illustrations by artists such as Henri Julien; and from 1870 to 1883. They founded the New York Daily Graphic in 1873, the first daily illustrated paper. While it was a pioneering effort, it was not a financial success, and Desbarats returned to Montreal.Black, Harry. Canadian Scientists and Inventors: Biographies of People who Shaped Our World, p. 57 (2d ed. 2008) In 1888 George-√âdouard went into business with his son William-Amable, and as Desbarats & Son they published the Dominion Illustrated.

Additionally, the methylthiotetrazole side chain inhibits Œ≥-carboxylation of glutamic acid; this can interfere with the actions of vitamin K. It has been described as a third-generation cephalosporin.  Synthesis  Oxa-substituted third generation cephalosporin antibiotic (oxacephalosporin). Moxalactam synthesis:M. Narisada, W. Nagata, ; eidem, (1977, 1979 both to Shionogi). (excerpt from Lednicer book 3) The benzhydrol ester of 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) is S-chlorinated and treated with base whereupon the intermediate sulfenyl chloride fragments (to 2). Next, displacement with propargyl alcohol in the presence of zinc chloride gives predominanntly the stereochemistry represented by diastereoisomer 3. The side chain is protected as the phenylacetylamide; the triple bond is partially reduced with a 5% Pd-CaCO3 (Lindlar catalyst) and then epoxidized with mCPBA to give 4. The epoxide is opened at the least hindered end with 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol to put in place the future C-3 side chain and give intermediate 5. Jones oxidation followed in turn by ozonolysis (reductive work-up with zinc-AcOH) and reaction with SOCl2 and pyridine give halide 6. The stage is now wet for intramolecular Wittig reaction. Displacement with PPh3 and Wittig olefination gives 1-oxacephem 7. Next a sequence is undertaken of side chain exchange and introduction of a 7-methoxyl group analogous to that which is present in cephamycins and gives them the enhanced beta-lactamase stability. First 7 is converted to the imino chloride with PCl5 and then to the imino methyl ether (with methanol) and next hydrolyzed to the free amine (8). Imine formation with 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is next carried out leading to 9. Oxidation with nickel(III) oxide gives iminoquinone methide 10, to which methanol is added in a conjugate sense and in the sterechemistry represented by formula 11. The imine is exchanged with Girard's reagent T to give 12, and this is acylated by a suitable protected arylmalonate, as the hemiester hemiacid chloride so as to give 11. Deblocking with aluminium chloride and anisole gives moxalactam 14.

They released two albums, a live album and one joint project with Mikhail Men. History Long time friends Glenn Hughes and Joe Lynn Turner had first planned to release an album together in 1989, the two got together and wrote some demos, but nothing ended up being released from these sessions. In 2000 Hughes toured Japan with Turner, followed by joint appearances during the Voices of Classic Rock tour in 2001. During this time the two decided to start work on a new collaboration. First album The duo released their first album in February 2002, it was simply called HTP. The album featured Hughes‚Äô regular guitarist JJ Marsh, who contributed to much of the song-writing. There were also contributions drummer Shane Gaalaas and keyboardist Vince DiCola as well as guest guitarists John Sykes, Paul Gilbert and Akira Kajiyama. The album featured the hard rock and AOR sounds that both Hughes and Turner had been known for, as well as a slight funk edge, brought in by Hughes‚Äô bass lines, and exemplified in such tracks as \\"Sister Midnight\\" and \\"Better Man.\\" The pair hit the road for a Japanese tour, joined by native musicians Akira Kajiyama, Toshio Egawa and Yoshihiro Kudo. Their set-lists consisting of tracks from the HTP album as well as various numbers from their past bands including Deep Purple, Rainbow and Black Sabbath songs. Their shows at Shibuya Club Quattro in Tokyo were recorded for a live album which was released in August 2002, titled Live In Tokyo. Hughes Turner Project continued their tour in Russia and Europe, this time joined by guitarist JJ Marsh keyboardist Joakim Svalberg and drummer Tomas Broman. After the conclusion of the tour the Hughes Turner Project took a short break, during which Hughes released his solo album Songs In The Key Of Rock and Turner released JLT. Second album In April 2003 the two got together to start work on a follow up to the first album. The pair were joined again by guitarist JJ Marsh, drummer Shane Gaalaas and keyboardist Ed Roth, who had worked with Hughes on many of his solo albums. Special guests included Steve Vai, Jeff Kollman and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. Smith, Kollman and Roth would later unite under the name Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats, an all-instrumental 70s funk/fusion project. The follow-up album, simply titled HTP 2 was released in September 2003 and was stylistically in a similar vein to the first record. In early 2004 Hughes Turner Project again hit the road starting in Japan and then moving on to Russia and Europe. They were joined by the same musicians as the first HTP tour, except on the European leg where keyboardist Kjell Haraldsson replaced Joakim Svalberg. After the conclusion of the tour the pair decided to put the Hughes Turner Project on an indefinite hiatus so they could focus more on their solo careers. Michael Men Project Although the Hughes Turner Project had drawn to a close the pair travelled to Moscow in September 2004 to record vocals for an album composed and organised by Moscow‚Äôs deputy mayor Mikhail Men. Men, who is also a professional musician had written the majority of the material for the project in the 1980s and after meeting the pair on their Russian tour had requested their services for the album. Hughes and Turner‚Äôs vocals were arranged in a similar way to the HTP albums and both contributed the majority of the lyrics. The album, entitled Made In Moscow was released in July 2005 in Russia only and to date has not been made available outside of the country.

This complex has sets of up to four points: the points themselves (shown as red circles), pairs of points (black edges), triples of points (pale blue triangles), and quadruples of points (dark blue tetrahedrons). In topology, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex, also called the Vietoris complex or Rips complex, is an abstract simplicial complex that can be defined from any metric space M and distance Œ¥ by forming a simplex for every finite set of points that has diameter at most Œ¥. That is, it is a family of finite subsets of M, in which we think of a subset of k points as forming a (k ‚àí 1)-dimensional simplex (an edge for two points, a triangle for three points, a tetrahedron for four points, etc.); if a finite set S has the property that the distance between every pair of points in S is at most Œ¥, then we include S as a simplex in the complex. History The Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex was originally called the Vietoris complex, for Leopold Vietoris, who introduced it as a means of extending homology theory from simplicial complexes to metric spaces.; ; ; . After Eliyahu Rips applied the same complex to the study of hyperbolic groups, its use was popularized by , who called it the Rips complex.; . The name \\"Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex\\" is due to .. Relation to ƒåech complex The Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex is closely related to the ƒåech complex (or nerve) of a set of balls, which has a simplex for every finite subset of balls with nonempty intersection: in a geodesically convex space Y, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex of any subspace X ‚äÇ Y for distance Œ¥ has the same points and edges as the ƒåech complex of the set of balls of radius Œ¥/2 in Y that are centered at the points of X. However, unlike the ƒåech complex, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex of X depends only on the intrinsic geometry of X, and not on any embedding of X into some larger space. As an example, consider the uniform metric space M3 consisting of three points, each at unit distance from each other. The Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex of M3, for Œ¥ = 1, includes a simplex for every subset of points in M3, including a triangle for M3 itself. If we embed M3 as an equilateral triangle in the Euclidean plane, then the ƒåech complex of the radius-1/2 balls centered at the points of M3 would contain all other simplexes of the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex but would not contain this triangle, as there is no point of the plane contained in all three balls. However, if M3 is instead embedded into a metric space that contains a fourth point at distance 1/2 from each of the three points of M3, the ƒåech complex of the radius-1/2 balls in this space would contain the triangle. Thus, the ƒåech complex of fixed-radius balls centered at M3 differs depending on which larger space M3 might be embedded into, while the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex remains unchanged. If any metric space X is embedded in an injective metric space Y, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex for distance Œ¥ and X coincides with the ƒåech complex of the balls of radius Œ¥/2 centered at the points of X in Y. Thus, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex of any metric space M equals the ƒåech complex of a system of balls in the tight span of M. Relation to unit disk graphs and clique complexes The Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex for Œ¥ = 1 contains an edge for every pair of points that are at unit distance or less in the given metric space. As such, its 1-skeleton is the unit disk graph of its points. It contains a simplex for every clique in the unit disk graph, so it is the clique complex or flag complex of the unit disk graph.. More generally, the clique complex of any graph G is a Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex for the metric space having as points the vertices of G and having as its distances the lengths of the shortest paths in G. Other results If M is a closed Riemannian manifold, then for sufficiently small values of Œ¥ the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex of M, or of spaces sufficiently close to M, is homotopy equivalent to M itself., . describe efficient algorithms for determining whether a given cycle is contractible in the Rips complex of any finite point set in the Euclidean plane. Applications As with unit disk graphs, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex has been applied in computer science to model the topology of ad hoc wireless communication networks. One advantage of the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex in this application is that it can be determined only from the distances between the communication nodes, without having to infer their exact physical locations. A disadvantage is that, unlike the ƒåech complex, the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex does not directly provide information about gaps in communication coverage, but this flaw can be ameliorated by sandwiching the ƒåech complex between two Vietoris‚ÄìRips complexes for different values of Œ¥., . A usable implementation of Vietoris-Rips complexes can be found in the TDAstats R package. Vietoris‚ÄìRips complexes have also been applied for feature-extraction in digital image data; in this application, the complex is built from a high- dimensional metric space in which the points represent low-level image features..

It is a Beta lactam antibiotic, like penicillin. Its chemical structure contains 3 cephems, 4 carboxyl groups and three pyridinium methyl groups. Cephaloridine is mainly used in veterinary practice. It is unique among cephalosporins in that it exists as a zwitterion. History Since the discovery of cephalosporins P, N and C in 1948 there have been many studies describing the antibiotic action of cephalosporins and the possibility to synthesize derivatives. Hydrolysis of cephalosporin C, isolation of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid and the addition of side chains opened the possibility to produce various semi-synthetic cephalosporins. In 1962, cephalothin and cephaloridine were introduced. Cephaloridine was briefly popular because it tolerated intramuscularly and attained higher and more sustained levels in blood than cephalothin. However, it binds to proteins to a much lesser extent than cephalothin. Because it is also poorly absorbed after oral administration the use of this drug for humans declined rapidly, especially since the second generation of cephalosporins was introduced in the 1970s. Today, it is more commonly used in veterinary practice to treat mild to severe bacterial infections caused by penicillin resistant and penicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella, Clostridium diphtheriae, Salmonella and Shigella. Interest in studying cephalosporins was brought about by some unusual properties of cephaloridine. This antibiotic stands in sharp contrast to various other cephalosporins and to the structurally related penicillins in undergoing little or no net secretion by the mammalian kidney. Cephaloridine is, however, highly cytotoxic to the proximal renal tubule, the segment of the nephron responsible for the secretion of organic anions, including para-am-minohippurate (PAH), as well as the various penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The cytotoxicity of cephaloridine is completely prevented by probenecid and several other inhibitors of organic anion transport, including the nearly nontoxic cephalothin. Structure & reactivity Cephaloridine is a cephalosporin compound with pyridinium-1-ylmethyl and 2-thienylacetamido side groups. The molecular nucleus, of which all cephalosporins are derivatives, is A3-7-aminocephalosporanic acid. Conformations around the Œ≤-lactam rings are quite similar to the molecular nucleus of penicillin, while those at the carboxyl group exocyclic to the dihydrothiazine and thiazolidine rings respectively are different. Synthesis Cephaloridine can be synthesised from Cephalotin and pyridine by deacetylation. This can be done by heating an aqueous mixture of cephalotin, thiocyanate, pyridine and phosphoric acid for several hours. After cooling, diluting with water, and adjusting the pH with mineral acid, cephaloridine thiocyanate salt precipitates. This can be purified and converted to cephaloridine by pH adjustment or by interaction with ion-exchange resin. Clinical use of cephaloridine Before the 1970s, cephaloridine was used to treat patients with urinary tract infections. Besides the drugs has been used successfully in the treatment of various lower respiratory tract infections. Cephaloridine was very effective to cure pneumococcal pneumonia. It has a high clinical and bacteriological rate of success in staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. Kinetics Absorption Cephaloridine is easily absorbed after intramuscular injection and poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Distribution The minor pathway of elimination is biliary excretion. When the blood serum concentration is 24 ¬µg/ml, the corresponding biliary concentration is 10 ¬µg/ml. In the spinal fluid the concentration of cephaloridine is 6‚Äì12% of the concentration in the blood and serum. Cephaloridine is distributed well into the liver, stomach wall, lung and spleen and is also found in fresh wounds one hour after injection. The concentration in the wound will decrease as the wound age increases. However, the drug is poorly penetrated into the cerebrospinal fluid and is found in a much smaller amount in the cerebral cortex. Pregnancy When cephaloridine is administered to pregnant women, the drug crosses the placenta. Cephaloridine concentrations can be measured in the serum of the newborn up to 22 hours after labor, and can reach a level of 54% of the concentration in the maternal serum. When given an intramuscular dose of 1 g, a peak occurs in the cord blood after 4 hours. In amniotic fluid, the concentration takes about 3 hours to reach its antibacterial effect. Metabolism and excretion Urine specimens showed that no other microbiologically active metabolites were present except cephaloridine and that cephaloridine is excreted unchanged. Renal clearances were reported to be 146‚Äì280 ml/min, a plasma clearance of 167 ml/min/1,73m2 and a renal clearance of 125 ml/min/1,73m2. A serum half-life of 1,1-1,5 hour and a volume of distribution of 16 liters were reported. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic analysis is not possible because appropriate data is not published. The physicochemical properties are almost the same as the other cephalosporins, therefore the pharmacokinetics are comparable. Adverse effects Toxicity Cephaloridine can cause kidney damage in humans, since it is actively taken up from the blood by the proximal tubular cells via an organic anion transporter (OAT) in the basolateral membrane. Organic anions are secreted through the proximal tubular cells via unidirectional transcellular transport. The organic anions are taken up from the blood into the cells across the basolateral membrane and extruded across the brush border membrane into the tubular fluid. Cephaloridine is a substrate for OAT1 and thus can be transported into the proximal tubular cells, which form the renal cortex. The drugs, however, cannot move readily across the luminal membrane since it is a zwitterion. The cationic group (pyridinium ring) of the compound probably inhibits the efflux through the membrane. This results in an accumulation of cephaloridine in the renal cortex of the kidney, causing damage and necrosis of the S2 segment of the tubule. However, there are no adverse effects on renal function if serum levels of cephaloridine are maintained between 20 and 80 Œºg/ml. Metabolism Cephaloridine is excreted in the urine without undergoing metabolism. It inhibits organic ion transport in the kidney. This process is preceded by the lipid peroxidation. Thereafter, probably a combination of events, such as formation of a reactive intermediate, a free radical and stimulation of lipid peroxidation, lead to peroxidative damage to cell membranes and mitochondria. It is not yet clear whether metabolic activation by cytochromes P-450, chemical rearrangements, reductive activation or all these actions are involved. The hypotheses made about the mechanism of action causing the toxicity of cephaloridine are: * Reactive metabolites are formed by cytochromes P-450 or emerge from destabilization of the Œ≤-lactam ring. Metabolic activation of the drugs might take place via cytochromes P-450, producing reactive metabolites. This hypothesis is based on the behaviour of some inhibitors of CYP450, which decrease the toxicity, and some inducers of the monooxygenases which increase toxicity. It could also be possible that a reactive intermediate is formed due to the unstable Œ≤-lactam ring. The pyridinium side-group of cephaloridine has unstable bonds to the core of the compound (in comparison with other cephalosporins). When this side-group leaves, the Œ≤-lactam ring is destabilized by intramolecular electron shifts. Thus, the leaving group creates a reactive product. * Both lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress can cause membrane damage. Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress take place as lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde, have been detected. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and NADPH are both depleted. Consequently, GSSG cannot be reduced to GSH. This leads to an increased toxicity since oxidative stress cannot be reduced. In addition, nephrotoxicity is augmented by deficiency of selenium or tocopherol. The pyridinium side-group interacts with the reduced NADP in a redox cycle. It has been suggested that superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals may be formed and that lipid peroxidation could be responsible for the toxicity of cephaloridine. * Damage to the mitochondria and intracellular respiratory processes and reduced mitochondrial respiration can cause nephrotoxicity. The previously mentioned damages have been detected after exposure to cephalosporins. Œ≤-lactam antibiotics injure mitochondria by an attack on the metabolic substrate carriers of the inner membrane. Respiratory toxicity is caused by inactivation of mitochondrial anion substrate carriers. Symptoms of kidney damage caused by cephaloridine Some symptoms caused by cephaloridine are: asymptomatic, enzymuria, proteinuria, tubular necrosis, increased urea level in blood, anemia, increased hydrogen ion level in blood, fatigue, increased blood pressure, increased blood electrolyte level, kidney dysfunction, kidney damage, impaired body water balance and impaired electrolyte balance. Complications caused by cephaloridine Complications caused by the use of cephaloridine include seizures, coma, chronic kidney failure, acute kidney failure and death. Treatment of kidney damage caused by cephaloridine The damage of the kidneys can be treated by removing the toxin from the body, monitoring and supporting kidney function (dialysis if necessary) and, in severe cases, kidney transplant. Supportive therapy in the acute phase can be done by fluid, electrolyte and hypertension management. Longer term management includes monitoring of renal function, close management of high blood pressure. Furthermore, dietary management may include protein and sodium management, adequate hydration and phosphate and potassium restriction. In case of chronic kidney failure dietary management also includes erythropoietin agonists (since anaemia is associated with chronic kidney failure), phosphate binders (in case of hyperphosphatemia), calcium supplements, Vitamin D supplements and sodium bicarbonate (to correct the acid-base disturbance).

He was the brother of an important royal official, William de Chesney, and the uncle of Gilbert Foliot, successively Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was Archdeacon of Leicester before his election as bishop in December 1148. Chesney served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of Thomas Becket, and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by King Stephen, including the right to a mint, Chesney was present at the coronation of King Henry II in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with St Albans Abbey in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans. Chesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral. Historical background After King Henry I's death in 1135, the succession was disputed as the king's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. The main contenders were the king's daughter Matilda, dowager empress of the Holy Roman Empire, and his nephews Stephen, Count of Boulogne, and Theobald II, Count of Champagne. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of the king of Scotland, David I, her maternal uncle, and the support of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I, in 1138.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 71‚Äì73 Stephen was initially secure on his throne but, by 1139, stresses had appeared. David I invaded England in 1138, and some of the English nobles rebelled, but Stephen had dealt with both threats by April 1139. Later that year, he arrested Roger, the Bishop of Salisbury, and his nephews Nigel, the Bishop of Ely and Alexander, the Bishop of Lincoln, who were not only powerful ecclesiastics but important royal administrators. In September 1139, Matilda landed in England to contest the throne, supported by her half-brother Robert. Stephen himself was captured in February 1141 by Matilda's forces, but Robert's subsequent capture by forces loyal to Stephen later that year allowed his exchange for Stephen in November 1141. The result was an effective stalemate, with Stephen controlling parts of the country and others under the control of Matilda's supporters. During the 1140s, Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, wrested Normandy from Stephen.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 73‚Äì75 Early life Chesney's family originated from Quesnay-Guesnon in the Calvados region of Normandy near Bayeux in France,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops of Lincoln but they had settled in the Midlands of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, and became one of Oxfordshire's leading landowners.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 239 footnote 19 Another brother, Reginald, was the abbot of Evesham Abbey.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 327 Chesney's sister Agnes was married to Robert Foliot, steward to the Earl of Huntingdon. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a surmise that Foliot's mother was a sibling of Chesney, it is certain that Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops of Hereford Chesney probably attended schools in either Oxford or Paris, as later in life he was referred to with the title of magister, signifying that he was educated.Owen \\"Chesney, Robert de (d. 1166)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was Archdeacon of Leicester by about 1146,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons of Leicester and held the prebend of Stow. He was also a canon of the chapel of St. George at Oxford Castle.Barlow English Church pp. 100‚Äì101 Election Chesney was elected to the See of Lincoln on 13 December 1148,Fryde, et. al Handbook of British Chronology p. 255 by his cathedral chapter, apparently without outside interference. He was consecrated by Theobald of Bec at Canterbury Cathedral on 19 December, the day after his ordination as a priest. Gilbert Foliot's letters provide some background to Chesney's election, showing that King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, attempted to secure Lincoln for one of their relatives: the royal candidates were the abbots of F√©camp, Westminster, and St Benet's of Hulme. They were rejected by Pope Eugene III, paving the way for the chapter to elect Chesney. Foliot relates that the electors from the chapter travelled to London, where they proceeded to elect Chesney in front of Foliot, Theobald, and some other bishops. That account is contradicted by Chesney's profession of obedience to Theobald, which claims that the election took place on 13 December 1148 at Westminster. Henry of Huntingdon and Ralph de Diceto, both medieval chroniclers, approved of the election and mentioned the unanimous nature of Chesney's selection.Saltman Theobald pp. 106‚Äì107 That Chesney's brother William was a firm supporter of Stephen's probably helped reconcile Stephen and his brother to Chesney's election. Chesney returned to Lincoln on 6 January 1149, where he received a letter from Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux in Normandy, congratulating him on his appointment. Arnulf also asked Chesney to help the cause of Henry fitzEmpress, Empress Matilda's eldest son and a contender for the English throne.Chibnall Empress Matilda p. 148 Bishop under Stephen Correspondence between Chesney and his nephew Gilbert Foliot suggests their relationship was quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election.Knowles Episcopal Colleagues p. 16 Foliot later ordered a copy of the Digest for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in Roman law.Saltman Theobald p. 175 and footnote 6 Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum in an English source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.Saltman Theobald p. 177 Shortly after his consecration, Chesney was presented with a copy of the newly updated version of Henry of Huntingdon's Historia Anglorum; Huntingdon had been a fellow archdeacon.Matthew King Stephen pp. 128‚Äì129 Chesney was present at several of King Stephen's courts, and the king named the bishop as the local justice for Lincolnshire. At the height of the civil war during Stephen's reign, and shortly after Chesney's consecration, the bishop acted as a guarantor for the treaty between Ranulf de Gernon, the Earl of Chester, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, drawn up to limit the fighting between the two earls during the civil war.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 238 Chesney was present at the legatine council held by Theobald in March 1151, and was one of the judges, along with Theobald and Hilary of Chichester, the Bishop of Chichester, in a dispute between the monks of Belvoir Priory and a secular clerk over the right of the clerk to a church.Saltman Theobald p. 36 Chesney appointed the future Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, to a prebend in his cathedral chapter during the latter part of Stephen's reign.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 36 The civil war ended with the Treaty of Winchester, late in 1153, which provided that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace. In the last year of Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the right to operate a mint in the town of Newark, granted in perpetuity. But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln,King King Stephen p. 297 and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of Banbury in 1154.Amt Accession of Henry II p. 55 Bishop under Henry II Chesney witnessed a charter of Henry fitzEmpress' before Henry's succession to the throne as Henry II, and was present at the consecration of Roger de Pont L'√âv√™que as Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154.Saltman Theobald p. 123 The bishop then was present at Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154, and appears to have continued to act as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during the early part of King Henry II's reign; the 1156 Pipe Roll has the sheriff of the county accounting for 10 marks arising from the pleas of the bishop in the county.Stenton English Justice p. 68 Chesney was often with the royal court, as he attested a number of Henry II's charters during the early part of the king's reign, and accompanied him to northern England in 1158 and to Normandy in 1160. The bishop served as the judge in a dispute in 1158 between a dean from the diocese of York and a citizen of Scarborough, in which the layman alleged that the dean had extorted large sums of money from him by repeatedly charging his wife with adultery and fining her. The dean's actions were contrary to a royal decree, but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk. The result of the case, a precursor to the later Becket dispute, aroused King Henry's anger, but the death of the king's brother Geoffrey and the king's subsequent travel to the Continent to deal with that issue meant that the matter was eventually dropped.Saltman Theobald pp. 160‚Äì161 In 1161 Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with St Albans Abbey, resulting from his efforts to enforce his right, as bishop, to supervise religious houses within his diocese. Although Pope Alexander III sent a papal bull to England ordering the case to be heard by a panel of two bishops, King Henry II felt that the papal order infringed on his royal rights and had the case decided at the royal court instead.Saltman Theobald p. 159 In 1155‚Äì1156 St Albans had secured papal privileges from the English Pope Adrian IV, who had previously been a monk there, that exempted the abbey from diocesan supervision, and it was these privileges that Chesney challenged. Chesney secured not only the papal bull but a royal commission to investigate the rights of the abbey as they were in the time of King Henry I. The final disposition of the case took place in 1163, at a royal council at Westminster, where the abbey produced both the papal privileges and a forged charter of Offa of Mercia in support of their case. As Chesney was unable to produce any documents in support of his own position, the king and council told the bishop that they favoured the abbey's cause. The king also ruled that the abbey was a royal proprietary church, and thus had special exemptions.Knowles Monastic Order pp. 587‚Äì588 In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the abbey compensated the bishopric with some land in return for the bishop renouncing his claims.Richardson and Sayles Governance of Mediaeval England pp. 292‚Äì293 Early in 1162 Chesney was summoned to Normandy by the king, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, and Hilary of Chichester, in order to lend their support to the election of Thomas Becket to the see of Canterbury.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 69 In July 1163, Chesney was present at the royal court held at Woodstock Palace, which included the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, the prince of Northern Wales Owain Gwynedd, and King Malcolm IV of Scotland. The two Welsh princes and the Scots' king did homage to Henry II while at this court.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 88 In 1163 Chesney was excused from attending a papal council at Tours because of his health, but he attended the royal councils of Clarendon and Northampton in 1164, which dealt with the growing dispute, now known as the Becket controversy, between the king and Becket. At those councils Chesney attempted to persuade Becket to compromise, but was unsuccessful. The king subsequently sent Chesney to northern England as an itinerant justice in 1166. Chesney's contributions to the king's military campaigns on the continent caused him financial difficulties; at the time of his death he was in debt to a moneylender. Diocesan affairs The marble baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, likely commissioned by Chesney Chesney's acta, or documents, contain many examples of him settling judicial disputes, demonstrating how active he was in his diocese. More than 240 of his acta have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a papal judge-delegate at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should be subject to royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice. In addition to judicial affairs, Chesney worked to ensure good relations with his cathedral chapter, and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction. He also permitted the clergy of his diocese to remit the payment of chrism money and forwent the traditional annual payment from the archdeacons of the diocese to the bishop. He suppressed unlicensed schools in Huntingdon and employed a number of educated clerks; his acta almost always include one witness entitled magister, and often as many as six. Chesney was a builder in his diocese, where he ordered the construction of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men,Page (ed.) \\"Houses of the Gilbertine order\\" History of the County of Lincoln although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women.Burton Monastic and Religious Orders pp. 98‚Äì99 In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154. Death and legacy Bishop's Palace in Lincoln, which Chesney helped construct The exact date of Chesney's death is uncertain. It may have been 27 December 1166; the event is commemorated on both 26 and 27 December. He was buried in the eastern cross aisle of Lincoln Cathedral, along the north side. The modern historian David Knowles wrote that Chesney was \\"not a man of strong character or decided opinions\\". Chesney left at least ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a uniformity of handwriting, leading to speculation that there may have been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.Thomsom Catalogue of the Manuscripts p. xv In addition to Foliot, the brothers Gerard, a canon of Lincoln, and Martin, treasurer of Lincoln, were also Chesney's nephews. He may also have been related to Fulk de Chesney, another canon at Lincoln. Chesney helped to further the career of Richard Barre, who became a writer and a royal judge and first appears in the record as a witness to some of Chesney's documents during 1160‚Äì1164.Turner \\"Richard Barre\\" Judges, Administrators, and the Common Law p. 185 Geoffrey of Monmouth's last work, the Vita Merlini, was dedicated to Chesney.Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 217 Foliot owned a copy of the Digest, part of the Corpus iuris civilis, that had originally been glossed for Chesney.Duggan \\"Roman, Canon, and Common Law \\" Historical Research pp. 11‚Äì12 Traditionally, Chesney's predecessor Alexander has been credited with commissioning the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of Tournai marble.

Route description Leonard Harrison State Park to Wellsboro PA 660 east of Leonard Harrison State Park PA 660 begins at the entrance to Leonard Harrison State Park in Shippen Township. The route proceeds eastward out of the park into Shippen Township, reaching an intersection with State Route 3004 (SR 3004, Snyder Point Road), where the southeast-bound right-of-way is taken over for PA 660\\\\. PA 660 makes a short dip into the community of Kennedy, where it turns eastward at an intersection with Wilson Street. The highway makes a long eastward stretch through the rural areas of Tioga County, paralleling SR 3004 for a distance to the south. After the intersection with Martin Road, PA 660 turns northward, intersecting with SR 3004's other terminus, where it turns east along the right-of-way. A short distance later, PA 660 enters Thumptown, a local community in Delmar Township. There, the highway comes to an intersection with SR 3006 (Stony Fork School Road) and SR 3007 (West Branch Road). PA 660 turns to the northeast on the right-of-way once held by SR 3007 and crosses through Delmar Township's rural surroundings before entering the community of Dexter, where PA 660 turns eastward at an intersection with SR 3029 (Airport Road), which connects to PA 362 and Grand Canyon State Airport. Wellsboro signage for the PA 287 and PA 660 concurrency Meanwhile, PA 660 crosses through Dexter and continues in a general eastward manner until reaching Morral Road, where it proceeds northeastward once again. At this stretch, some residences appear along the side of the road and soon PA 660 intersects with the western terminus of PA 362, east of the Grand Canyon State Airport in Delmar Township. Like before, PA 660 turns along the right-of-way formerly used by PA 362, and begins crossing through a more developed portion of Delmar Township. Passing to the north of Tioga Country Club, PA 660 gains the moniker of Pinecreek Road before entering the borough of Wellsboro. In Wellsboro, PA 660 changes monikers to West Avenue, crossing through a dense portion of the center of the borough. After curving to the northeast once again at the intersection with Lincoln Street, the moniker changes to Main Street. After passing through more of the commercial district, PA 660 intersects with PA 287 (Central Avenue) in downtown Wellsboro. The two roads form a short concurrency before intersecting with US 6 (East Avenue). At this intersection, PA 287 proceeds on a concurrency west with US 6, while PA 660 proceeds east on its concurrency with US 6\\\\. After the intersection, US 6 and PA 660 head eastward through a more residential portion of Wellsboro. The two highways continue eastward as East Avenue, before proceeding to leave Wellsboro for Charleston Township. Charleston Township to Richmond Township After leaving Wellsboro for Charleston Township, the moniker switches to Grand Army of the Republic Highway, a name associated with US 6 throughout the United States. The two roads almost immediately enters the hamlet of Pitts, which consists of a few residences and industries at the eastern edges of Wellsboro. US 6 and PA 660 leave Pitts and bend to the northeast through Charleston Township, mainly rural for most of the trip. Both roads pass to the southeast of Dart Settlement and begin a parallel with an old alignment of US 6 through Charleston Township. The old alignment merges in with the newer one at a bend in the highway, which turns eastward for a small strip before turning northeastward once again. At the intersection with Charleston Road in the community of Whitneyville, PA 660 turns eastward from US 6 as North Elk Run Road. For a distance, PA 660 has a parallel with US 6 through fields. Soon after, both roads cross into Richmond Township. The surroundings on PA 660 remain rural while the parallel begins to break at the intersection with Spencer Road, where the highway turns to the southeast.

He first served in the household of Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, then later served the household of Hugh of Avalon, Bishop of Lincoln. After Hugh's death and a two-year vacancy in the see, or bishopric, Blois was elected to succeed Hugh in 1203. Little is known about his episcopate, although 86 of his documents survive from that time period. He died in 1206 and was buried in his cathedral. Early life Possibly related to Hugh de Puiset the bishop of Durham, who he went on to serve later in life, Blois probably came from Blois in France.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops His relationship with Puiset reinforces the likelihood of his origins being in Blois, as Puiset was a nephew of King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, both of whom came from Blois. Nothing else is known of Blois' origins.Smith \\"Blois, William de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was titled magister, implying that he attended a university and was well- educated.Scammell Hugh du Puiset p. 70 He taught at the school of Paris for a while, where at one point a townswoman tried to seduce him, resulting in the medieval writer Gerald of Wales later recounting the humorous story of how Blois resisted the lady's advances. Blois was frequently a witness to Puiset's charters, and was named as rector of a parish church in the city of Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Subdeans probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Precentors Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is a witness to some Scottish charters.Scammell Hugh du Puiset p. 235 Bishop of Lincoln Hugh of Avalon died on 16 November 1200, but no new bishop was elected for over two years. King John first tried to impose his own appointee, but was unable to force his choice on the cathedral chapter, who were responsible for electing a new bishop. John then left the see vacant, and some contemporaries accused the king of doing so to secure the revenues of the see for himself because of the regalian right English kings had to receive all the income from a vacant bishopric. Eventually the cathedral chapter was allowed to perform an election, and Blois was elected about 6 July 1203 and consecrated on 24 August 1203Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 255 at Canterbury. The consecration was performed by William of Sainte-M√®re- Eglise, the Bishop of London, because Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury was ill and unable to perform the service which would normally have been his right. Most of what is known about Blois' episcopate comes from his acta, or records; 86 of them survive. There is an early 14th-century reference to Blois' matricula, which can mean register, list, or list of students,Latham Revised Medieval Latin Word-List p. 293 but given the distance in time from when it was recorded to Blois' episcopate, it is unclear what exactly was meant by this. Nor has any such document survived. Blois' acta show him to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non- relatives, with only another William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative. Blois died on 10 May 1206, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral. In the early fourteenth century, he was still remembered well by the cathedral chapter and was described as learned and kindly by the 14th century writer John Schalby, who wrote a work on the lives of the bishops of Lincoln. Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de Marum. Marum succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, but there is no evidence supports that identification.Sharpe Handlist of the Latin Writers p. 754 Citations References     Category:Bishops of Lincoln Category:1206 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"William de Blois (bishop of Lincoln)"},{"id":"13056870","text":"The Knightstown Academy is a historic school building located at Knightstown, Henry County, Indiana.

He began his career in the diocese of Bath, where he served two successive bishops, before joining royal service under King John of England. He served in the royal administration until 1209, when he was elected to the see, or bishopric, of Lincoln. When John was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III in November 1209, Hugh went into exile in France, where he remained until 1213. When he returned to England, he continued to serve both John and John's son King Henry III, but spent most of his time in his diocese. He introduced new administrative methods into the diocese, as well as working to improve the educational and financial well-being of his clergy and to secure the canonisation of his predecessor Hugh of Avalon as a saint in 1220. Although the medieval writer Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being opposed to monastic houses and monks, there is little evidence of the bishop being biased, and after his death on 7 February 1235 parts of his estate were left to religious houses, including nunneries. Early life Hugh was the son of Edward of Wells and elder brother of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: BishopsGibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 186 Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was probably an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued in the service of the next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely that he ever received much schooling.Smith \\"Wells, Hugh of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Hugh was a keeper of the king's seal,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops serving as deputy to Simon of Wells, the Archdeacon of Wells who was Keeper of the Great Seal from around 1199 to 1204. Simon was also a relative of Hugh's, and seems to have helped secure positions for both Hugh and Jocelin in the royal administration.Turner King John p. 46 Hugh was a royal clerk in the chancery, the royal secretariat, and was named Archdeacon of Wells sometime before 25 April 1204. He held prebends in the diocese of Lincoln and diocese of London as well.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: Archdeacons of Wells His service in the chancery would have involved him in Hubert Walter's administrative innovations during his term as Chancellor. Besides his episcopal appointments, Hugh was rewarded with two manors in Somerset, including the Treasurer's House in Martock which he made his primary residence,Emery Greater Medieval Houses p. 589 and the right to collect taxes and fines in two hundreds in Somerset. He also served as the royal custodian of the diocese of Lincoln while the see was vacant between 1200 and 1203, collecting the revenues of the see, most of which went to the king while a see was without a bishop. In 1205 and 1206, Hugh was royal custodian for the diocese of Bath, which was similarly vacant. Bishop of Lincoln Hugh was elected to the see of Lincoln about 14 April 1209, after a papal command to the cathedral chapter to elect a new bishop, as Lincoln had again been without a bishop since 1206. During the summer of 1209, Hugh, along with his brother, was one of the councilors of King John urging the king to settle with Pope Innocent III before the pope excommunicated the king. However, negotiations with papal representatives got nowhere, and the king was excommunicated on 8 November 1209.Turner King John pp. 120‚Äì121 Hugh and his brother Jocelin had continued to support King John until this, two years after many of their fellow bishops had deserted the king,Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 11 but by late in the year, Hugh left the king's service and went into exile. The election, meanwhile, had aroused papal suspicions of undue royal influence, and Innocent sent Stephen Langton, the exiled Archbishop of Canterbury to investigate Hugh and the circumstances of his election. Langton was also to investigate rumours that Hugh was not celibate, and had two daughters. The results of the investigation must have been satisfactory, as Hugh was consecrated on 20 December 1209Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 255 at Melun. The consecration was performed by Langton. Hugh was in exile in France until he returned to England on 16 July 1213. His only known activity while in exile was the writing of a will, which was dated November 1212 and was drawn up at St Martin de Garenne, near Paris. Hugh attended the papal Fourth Lateran Council held in 1215 in Rome, along with a number of other English bishops, and both English archbishops.Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform pp. 106‚Äì107 Soon after his return from the council, Hugh served as a royal judge,Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 167 serving as one of the justices of the eyre for Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire in 1218 and 1219. In 1226 he was once more a royal justice. Later, he was employed by King Henry III as an ambassador, helping negotiate with King Louis VIII of France over the status of Normandy and Poitou. Hugh also worked to secure the canonisation of his predecessor Hugh of Avalon as a saint, which occurred in 1220. Diocesan affairs In 1222, along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Norwich, Hugh ordered that all those in their dioceses refrain from contact with Jews. This decree, however, was countermanded by a royal decree to the county sheriffs in the affected dioceses ordering them to imprison any residents who refused to interact with Jews.Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 135 Besides these activities, Hugh was active in his diocese, including supervising the various monastic houses within it. In 1227, a visitation to Eynsham Abbey resulted in Hugh deposing the abbot.Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 151 Although the 12th chronicler Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being biased against monks and nuns, and even called him the \\"untiring persecutor of monks, the hammer of canons, nuns and all the religious\\",Quoted in Smith \\"Wells, Hugh of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography there is little evidence that Hugh singled out monks for persecution. One reason for Paris' dislike of the bishop may have been the fact that the chronicler's own abbey of St Alban's had to compromise with Hugh over two legal disputes, dealing with the right to appoint to various benefices. Hugh once was credited with creating 300 new vicarages within the diocese,Moorman Church Life in England p. 45 largely on the basis of his surviving documents dealing with this, known as the Liber Antiquus. Further research has shown that a number of the vicarages he was once assumed to have founded were instead earlier foundations that Hugh either augmented or reassessed. Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education.Moorman Church Life in England pp. 91‚Äì92 The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese,Moorman Church Life in England p. 237 attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese had enough to live on.Moorman Church Life in England p. 240 Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste. In the administration of his diocese, Hugh introduced new methods of recording documents. This system was modelled on that which Hubert Walter had introduced into the chancery, with separate registers for each archdeaconry, and registers, or rolls, for charters and memoranda, much like the Charter Roll or Memoranda Roll of the royal chancery. He also undertook a survey of the endowments of the vicarages within his diocese. Hugh supported the building campaign of Salisbury Cathedral, ordering that money be collected throughout his diocese. Likewise, he ordered similar collections for Daventry Priory, Sulby Abbey and parish churches in his diocese. Not only churches benefited from these sorts of collections, as the bishop offered indulgences to those who helped build bridges at Brampton, Rockingham, and Aynho.Moorman Church Life in England pp. 204‚Äì205 Death and legacy Hugh died on 7 February 1235, at his episcopal residence at Stow Park. He was buried on 10 February 1235 in Lincoln Cathedral, in the north aisle. In 1233 he had written a new will, which mentions his brother and a niece named Agatha. He left bequests to his family, his household, Lincoln Cathedral, and a number of monasteries in his diocese. What was left after the specific legacies was to be divided between poor religious houses, such as the Barrow Gurney Nunnery,Page (ed.) \\"Houses of Benedictine Nuns\\" History of the County of Somerset students and teachers at Oxford University, Jewish converts and the poor on the episcopal manors. Hugh's register of ordinations still survives, and is in the Lincoln cathedral archives. Parts of this were published by Alfred Gibbons in 1888, and others in 1904 by the Canterbury and York Society. These records give not only the name of the person receiving a benefice, but what the clerical status of each new benefice holder was.Moorman Church Life in England p. 34 Notes Citations References       Category:1235 deaths Category:Bishops of Lincoln Category:Archdeacons of Wells Category:Year of birth unknown Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Hugh of Wells"},{"id":"13056910","text":"The Sault News is the main daily and newspaper of record of Sault Ste.

The southern terminus is at PA 120 in Lock Haven, while the northern terminus is at PA 44 on the Clinton-Lycoming county line in the community of Haneyville. The route passes through small communities, but does not intersect with any other legislated highways in the area. The route was assigned in 1930, two years after a majority of state routes were assigned, and was gradually paved from 1935 to 1966. There have been no changes in road alignment since its inception. Route description PA 664 begins at PA 120 in Lock Haven PA 664 begins at an intersection with PA 120 in the city of Lock Haven. The highway progresses northward, leaving the city limits of Lock Haven. After the intersection with East Water Street, PA 664 crosses the West Branch Susquehanna River. The bridge over the branch of river was constructed in 1986. At the intersection with Farrandsville Road, the highway turns eastward, paralleling the river. Nearing PA 150, the highway turns northward and into Dunnstown. While winding around a few curves, PA 664 intersects with Armory Drive, an access road to a local armory. The route's surroundings are highly developed in Dunnstown, with the highway passing along homes. At the intersection with Aikey Street, PA 664 leaves Dunnstown and proceeds northward. The highway passes some homes and forests north of Dunnstown, entering Woodward Township soon after. At the intersection with Township Road 406 (TR 406), PA 664 starts winding in several directions, but following a northward basis. This continues until the intersection with Arbutus Drive, where it heads straight to the northwest. At a clearing in a nearby forest, PA 664 enters the community of Swissdale. The stay in the community is short, with the highway leaving after a few blocks. Just north of Swissdale, PA 664 makes a long hairpin turn, curving from east to west before turning north once again. Just after the intersection with Honey Suckle Lane, PA 664 progresses towards Haneyville. PA 664 in Haneyville from PA 44 The next stretch of PA 664 is full of bends, and the highway continuously turns at a constant rate. At an intersection with another Honey Suckle Lane, the highway starts its northwestern progression once again. This changes again when Tedrow Lane begins paralleling the highway. Now following a steady northeastern alignment, the highway continues through the large patches of trees south of Haneyville. At Little Plum Run Road, the highway turns onto a steady northward alignment. The highway continues through the trees for a while, continuing northward on its way to Gallagher Township. At a bend in the highway, there is a small patch of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the intersection with TR 529, PA 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, PA 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, PA 664 ends at an intersection with PA 44 in the community of Haneyville. History PA 664 was assigned two years after the mass numbering of state routes in Pennsylvania in 1928. The highway itself took several years to transition from gravel to actual pavement. The first segment, which occurred in 1935, was from Little Plum Run Road and northward. The second segment was in 1936, when the Pennsylvania Department of Highways paved the piece of PA 664 from a point just south of Gallagher to the Gallagher Township line. In 1938, the third segment, from Swissdale to Gallagher Township was paved. In 1949, the Department of Highways paved the piece of PA 664 from Gallagher Township to the Lycoming County line. In 1951, the section between Swissdale and Little Plum Run Road was paved once again. Two years after that, the section from the Lycoming County line to PA 44 was improved in its condition. That lone section was improved in 1966. There have been no recorded changes in alignment since its 1930 assignment.

History The history of the Catholic League can be traced back to 1895, but the first season of the Catholic League as we know it was in 1955. The league is named for having mostly New Orleans' oldest and biggest Catholic schools, though some public schools have played in the league as well. Chalmette High School in St. Bernard Parish had the longest tenure of any public school in the Catholic League. Chalmette was admitted to the Catholic League, then District 6-AAAA, in 1970 and stayed for 18 years. Chalmette was an all-boys school through the 1987-88 school year, but played one more year in the league after admitting girls, since the LHSAA reclassifies schools in November of even-numbered years for the following two school terms. Chalmette exited the Catholic League for the 1989-90 school year, then dropped out of the highest classification when the LHSAA added a new classification for the 1991-92 term. The Owls did not rejoin the Catholic League until 2007, when Chalmette became the lone high school in St. Bernard following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and thus had a 5A enrollment. In 1992, the LHSAA's first classification plan for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 school years would have dissolved the Catholic League, spreading the seven schools amongst three districts and mixing them with public schools from Orleans and Jefferson Parishes. The plan drew serious objections from both Catholic and public schools: the Catholic League schools were afraid of significant financial losses, since public schools generally have far less fan support than Catholic schools; and the public schools feared competitive imbalance. Eventually, the Catholic League was kept intact, with Slidell High School added, a move which was sharply criticized by the St. Tammany Parish school board and Slidell supporters, who were angered to see longtime rivalries with fellow St. Tammany schools Covington and Mandeville placed on hiatus. Slidell was moved out of the Catholic League and back into a St. Tammany-based district in 1995-96. In 2010, LHSAA enrollment figures dropped Archbishop Shaw High School and St. Augustine High School into class 4A, leaving the district with three Catholic schools which had to be combined with three public schools to form a new district. WLAE-TV 32 in New Orleans has produced a documentary named Glory Days, with part 1, focusing on the 1950s and 60s, airing in November 2010, and part 2 airing in September 2012, which tells the tale of the 1970s, when the Catholic League was regarded as the toughest high school sporting district in America. More parts are planned. 2010 dissolution The LHSAA passed a rule in 2005 designed to limit schools with low enrollments playing \\"up\\" in class, believing that football powers such as John Curtis Christian School and Evangel Christian Academy were using 4A and 5A status, respectively, to attract students to their schools. Curtis was dropped to 2A in 2005, and Evangel to 1A before moving up to 2A in 2007. The effects of this rule shook up the Catholic League. De La Salle, which became a co-educational school in the 1992-93 school year, dropped out voluntarily after the 2002-2003 school year after being a member of the league since 1955. Archbishop Shaw left the league after 2005, and Holy Cross, with enrollment declining since Katrina and its school nearly destroyed by the levee breaches along the Industrial Canal, moved down to 4A for 2007 and further down to 3A for 2009. The league, left with four schools and in danger of being combined with a nearby Jefferson Parish public school league, accepted public school and former member Chalmette High School to bring itself back to five schools and remain a standalone league. Reclassification in 2009 added Archbishop Shaw back into the Catholic League, as their enrollment increased over the 5A threshold. It allowed Chalmette High School to move to a neighboring district of Jefferson Parish public schools where they hoped to be more competitive. The lingering effects of Katrina and a nationwide recession affected enrollment at St. Augustine and Archbishop Shaw enough to drop the two schools to class 4A in the 2010 reclassification, effective for the fall 2011 school semester. As a result, three 5A Catholic League schools would be left in the New Orleans area. Jesuit principal Michael Giambellaca authored a proposal to call a special LHSAA meeting mainly to vote to allow schools to play above their enrollment classification, but his proposal was defeated. The new district proposal featured Jesuit, Brother Martin, and Archbishop Rummel combined with the 5A Jefferson Parish Public School athletic district of John Ehret, L.W. Higgins, West Jefferson, Alfred Bonnabel, and Grace King, as well as public school and former Catholic League member Chalmette. There was some debate as to whether the new district could still be called a \\"Catholic League\\", but games between the Catholic schools (and former members now in 4A) would still probably be referred to as Catholic League games. On November 10, 2010, the LHSAA approved the final districts for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. Brother Martin, Jesuit and Rummel joined a Class 5A district with Chalmette, Grace King and West Jefferson (Grace King will not play a district schedule in football). Bonnabel, John Ehret and Higgins were assigned to a different 5A district with Destrehan, Hahnville and East St. John high schools to the west. For the 2011 and 2012 football seasons, Rummel maintained its rivalry games with Holy Cross, St. Augustine and Shaw, although the Shaw- Rummel games were canceled by tropical systems, Tropical Storm Lee in 2011 and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Jesuit played Holy Cross and Shaw, but not St. Augustine, and Brother Martin only played St. Augustine, continuing the rivalry between the Gentilly schools. Catholic League reforms for 2013 At its January 2012 convention, the LHSAA approved a new proposal by Giambelluca which allowed schools to play up from their enrollment-based classification by one class, effective with the 2013-14 school year. When the LHSAA began its reclassification for the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years in November 2012, Holy Cross, St. Augustine and Shaw all declared they would play up from 4A to 5A. The LHSAA placed those three schools with Brother Martin, Jesuit and Rummel in the new District 9-5A to re-form the Catholic League. All-girls Catholic schools Chapelle, Dominican and Mount Carmel were also placed in the district. The plan was approved by the LHSAA Executive Committee on December 12. Grace King and West Jefferson were placed in District 8-5A with the other Jefferson Parish schools in 5A: Bonnabel, Higgins, John Ehret and Helen Cox, which opted to play up from 4A. Destrehan, East St. John and Hahnville were placed in District 7-5A with schools from the Houma-Thibodaux area: Central Lafourche, H.L. Bourgeois, South Lafourche, Terrebonne and Thibodaux. Chalmette administrators appealed to be placed in the Jefferson Parish district 8-5A, but not without some dissent from their fanbase. John Curtis joins In November 2014, John Curtis football coach and school headmaster J.T. Curtis Jr. declared the Patriots would play up to Class 5A in all sports. The LHSAA placed John Curtis in the Catholic League, making it the first private non-Catholic school to become a member. For the 2014 football season, Curtis played in a Class 2A district during the regular season, but played in the Division I select state playoffs, which included the six then- current members of the Catholic League, as well as Evangel; St. Paul's, a Catholic all-boys school in Covington; and two co-educational Catholic schools in Lafayette, St. Thomas More and Teurlings Catholic. The Patriots lost the Division I championship game to Jesuit, 17-14.

Grace Point Church is a missional church and has over 75% of its membership serving on a weekly basis according to their spiritual gifts. Grace Point also sends over 200 of her members on global missions annually. Grace Point consistently baptizes over 100 people each year and her innovative practices have been noted in several books: Shaped by God‚Äôs Heart by Milfred Minatrea, Spiritual CPR by Todd Phillips, and Building Leaders by Aubrey Malphurs and Will Mancini. In 2005 Grace Point undertook a bold vision to plant 100 churches in a 10-year period. This missional church movement seeks to partner and plant reproducing churches. Grace Point Church also hosts the Willow Creek Leadership Summit led by Bill Hybels and continues to influence San Antonio and the world. History Grace Point Church, formerly known as Castle Hills Church Northwest, was started as a satellite campus of Castle Hills First Baptist Church in San Antonio, Texas, in November 1992. After months of negotiations with the Resolution Trust Corporation, an agreement was reached to purchase an abandoned church facility, complete with education classrooms and situated on nearly . One hundred families from the main campus were asked to make a one-year commitment to begin the satellite campus. Since November 1992, Grace Point Church has experienced steady growth and significant influence in the city of San Antonio. Dr. George Harris, Sr. Pastor of Castle Hills First Baptist Church from 1975 to 2003, passed the Castle Hills Church Northwest leadership mantle to his son Jeff Harris() in November 1994. Jeff continues to lead this congregation today, setting a clear vision. In February 1998, Castle Hills First Baptist Church initiated the constitution process for Castle Hills Church Northwest to become an autonomous church. The process received overwhelming approval. Under Pastor Jeff‚Äôs leadership Castle Hills Church Northwest voted in early 2002 to change the church name to Grace Point Church in order to better reflect her identity and the purpose of her existence: To lead common people to uncommon life in Jesus Christ. In March 2002, Grace Point Church dedicated the addition of a educational facility. In August 2014, Grace Point opened a second location on San Antonio's far west side, near 1604 W and Shaenfield Rd. Sunday services at Grace Point West include live worship music and preaching, with Grace Point's worship and teaching pastors rotating between its locations each week. On Father‚Äôs Day, 2016, GPC main campus experienced a devastating fire that destroyed the interior of the structure. The fire was ruled accidental by fire officials in the San Antonio Fire Department. The fire starting in an air conditioning unit on the roof of the building and made its way into the sanctuary. Although the main body of fire was relatively small, the resulting smoke and heat caused the majority of the damage. Dozens of units from the San Antonio Fire Department answered the call to service to extinguish the fire. Services were immediately moved to the Student Building adjacent to the main campus as rebuilding began. An newly redesigned main campus reopened in the fall of 2017. Children's Ministry Grace Point‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Ministry is well known for its Rotation Model Sunday School for 1st-5th Grades. This Workshop Rotation Model, called Crosswalk for Kids, allows children to learn and retain Biblical concepts through a variety of learning styles by rotating through various experience stations over a five-week period. The Biblical concept and story are the same for five weeks, but taught in different, relevant and exciting ways by teachers gifted and passionate about their particular workshop. The non-traditional classrooms include a Movie Theater, Computer Lab, and Kitchen, along with other classroom environments that allow the children to learn through video, computers, cooking, nature, drama, dance, puppets, music, art, and games. Notable Guests Grace Point has had many notable guests such as Kirk Whalum, Mike Huckabee, David Robinson, Alvin Gentry, Josh Davis, and 2000 Olympic diving gold medalist Laura Wilkinson.

Handbook of British Chronology p. 256 Bokyngham's diocese, which included Oxford and Lutterworth, was the headquarters of the Lollard movement. The bishop attempted to stop Swynderby's preaching and managed to turn him out of the chapel of St John the Baptist. Swynderby was, however, upheld by the people. He used two great stones which lay outside the chapel as a pulpit, and declared that as long as he had the goodwill of the people he would 'preach in the king's highway in spite of the bishop's teeth.' In May 1382 Bokyngham attended the synod called the council of 'the earthquake,' held in London by Archbishop Courtenay, in which the propositions ascribed to the Wycliffite preachers were pronounced heretical. While bishop, Bokyngham outlawed the veneration of a cross at Rippingale. However, the veneration continued and the advocates of the cult appealed to the papacy.Swanson Religion and Devotion p. 255 In 1393 Agnes Palmer was living as an anchoress next to St Peter's Church in Northampton.

In 1866 he received his medical degree from the University of Pavia, and afterwards joined the Italian Unification movement as an infantry soldier under Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807‚Äì1882). In 1867 he was seriously wounded and taken prisoner. Following his release and recovery, he traveled throughout Europe, furthering his medical studies. He learned surgical procedures in Vienna under Theodor Billroth (1829‚Äì1894), in Berlin under Bernhard von Langenbeck (1810‚Äì1887), and in Munich with Johann Nepomuk von Nussbaum (1829‚Äì1890). He also visited London, where he met with Thomas Spencer Wells (1818‚Äì1897) and Joseph Lister (1827‚Äì1912). Afterwards, he was in charge of the surgical department at the hospital La Spezia, and in 1878 became a lecturer in surgery at Parma. In 1882 he became head of surgical pathology at the University of Padua, where he later succeeded Tito Vanzetti (1809‚Äì1888) as the chair of clinical surgery (1888). Bassini is remembered for his operative techniques involving inguinal hernia repair. In 1884 he introduced a surgical procedure that allowed for reconstruction of the inguinal canal and restoration of the patient's anatomy following removal of the hernial sac. It was a landmark operation because the posterior wall of the inguinal canal could be rebuilt and reinforced with only surgical sutures. It required no additional reinforcement or prosthesis. Despite the importance of the new surgical method, it didn't become known outside of Italy until 1890. Bassini is credited for the advocation of antiseptic practices into Italian surgery. He introduced the usage of carbolic acid and eucalyptus to increase the chances of a patient's recovery and survival. Bassini's tomb in the Monumental Cemetery in Pavia Bassini's tomb in Pavia Bassini was buried in his family tomb, in the \\"Cimitero Monumentale\\" of Pavia, as well as other important Italian medical scientists, such as Camillo Golgi, Bartolomeo Panizza and Adelchi Negri.

Once quite popular, not much is still grown in France these days. History Peurion was popularized by the Augustinian monks at Langres north of Dijon and was widely grown before the phylloxera epidemic. DNA fingerprinting has shown that it is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais blanc (Heunisch) and Pinot, making it a full sibling of famous varieties such as Chardonnay and Aligot√©. Gouais blanc was widely grown by the French peasantry in the Medieval ages. This offered many opportunities for hybridization, and the offspring benefited from hybrid vigor as the parents were genetically quite different. Other Gouais blanc/Pinot crosses include Aubin vert, Auxerrois, Bachet noir, Beaunoir, Franc Noir de la Haute- Sa√¥ne, Gamay Blanc Gloriod, Gamay, Melon, Knipperl√©, Romorantin, Roublot, and Sacy. Viticulture Like many Gouais/Pinot crosses, Peurion produces a vigorous vine with small bunches of grapes, but it is rather more reliable than most such crosses.

She was born and raised in California's Bay Area, drawing creative influence from her parents and their friends. Her father is Manuel Neri, a prolific sculptor associated with the Bay Area Figurative Movement, and her mother, Susan Neri, is a graphic designer. Neri is both a painter and a sculptor, and has worked with a wide array of materials including clay, plaster, bronze, steel, fiberglass, glaze, acrylic, oil, and spray paint.[8] Lately, Neri has focused her practice and is primarily making clay sculpture.[7] Her work is based in abstraction and figuration, drawing inspiration from Bay Area Figuration, German Expressionism, graffiti, and folk art. Neri uses horses as a common motif in her work, which serves as a personal symbol of her youth. Reminisce (aka REM, pseudonyms of Ruby Rose Neri)\\"Reminisce Remembered\\" by Amor Sans Blague, Motility Blog, April 30, 2005. is a sculptor, painter, and former street artist from San Francisco and Los Angeles, California, known for her portrayal of horses.  Early life and influences  Born to a family of artists, Neri was exposed to ways of making and expressing from a very young age. Her mother's ability to render realistic images of human figures and horses proved to have a heavy influence in Neri's early work as a painter and a graffiti artist in the 1990s, and as subjects still remain in her work today. The style that her father developed as a sculptor during the second generation of Bay Area Figuration also influenced Neri's work, which emerged later in her life as she made the switch from painting to sculpture. Comparing one of Neri's earlier figurative sculptures to the work that her father is best known for, a number of visual similarities are apparent and evoke the closeness of their relationship. Though their handling of materials, surface treatment, and subject are akin at first glance, a deeper look might reveal subtle yet important differences.  Undergraduate studies: San Francisco Art Institute & The Mission School  In 1992, Ruby moved from Nicasio, California to San Francisco, CA to study painting at the San Francisco Art Institute. Ruby's father, Manuel was teaching at SFAI while Ruby was a student, making his presence and influence in her education almost unavoidable. Ruby stated in an interview that, ‚ÄúDuring undergrad at SFAI all my teachers were either my father‚Äôs students or his contemporaries; I felt very limited by this but was unaware of it at the time‚Äù. Despite this limitation, her experience at SFAI proved to be one of the most influential times in her life and career. While there, she became close friends with artists Alicia McCarthy, Barry McGee, and Margaret Kilgallen. She and her friends would later become associated with the movement known as ‚ÄúThe Mission School‚Äù, canonized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2010, when the institution deemed the Mission School, ‚Äú...the most significant art movement to emerge out of San Francisco in the late twentieth century‚Äù. In the book ‚ÄúEnergy That is All Around‚Äù, Curator Hesse McGraw credits this group of deeply connected artists with changing the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of SFAI as an institution, stating that, ‚ÄúThey have come to reflect the highest achievement of an art school, which is to cultivate artists whose work adds new strains to contemporary art, and perhaps more importantly, who care about each other enough to add life to a community of artists‚Äù. Members of The Mission School were working within a special combination of time and place, growing up in and around art school during the early to mid-1990s during the pre-internet age, when San Francisco still possessed its ‚Äúlegendary bohemian-inflected vibe‚Äù. They were gearing up to start their art careers at the ‚Äúvery cusp of the digital age‚Äù, and with San Francisco's proximity to Silicon Valley they would go on to, ‚Äúexperience a culture-shattering dot-com technology boom/bust in the mid to late ‚Äò90s‚Äù, which brought with it a rampant case of gentrification. Through these shared experiences, The Mission School artists cultivated an anti-establishment, anti-consumerist outlook on the world. Their collective energy, worldview and active participation in various ‚Äúdisobedient‚Äù subcultures lead to the shared aesthetic in their artworks, an aesthetic that is visibly connected to Neri's oeuvre. During Neri's time at SFAI, she formed her network of friends through a common interest in graffiti, which ultimately lead to her inclusion in the Mission School movement. Although writing graffiti was more of a social and sometimes political outlet than a serious artistic pursuit for Neri, the influence of her time spent painting in the street is still visible in her work today.  Graduate studies: UCLA  In 1994, Ruby moved from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, and would go on to earn her Master's of Fine Art from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1998. There, she made the gradual transition from producing mostly painting to sculpture. Her first foray into sculpture was through plaster, which she used to create abstracted figures of humans and horses in a style reminiscent of cubist painting. This transition was perhaps sparked by the fact that she was, for the first time, free of the impositions of her father's legacy. Her frustration with the weight of painting's history encouraged this transition into sculpture to continue. As Neri states in an interview for the Los Angeles Review of Books, ‚ÄúPainting is so demanding in terms of its history. The whole idea of what painting is became problematic for me and I didn‚Äôt have the time to address all the issues that were not interesting to me at all...‚Äù.  Current work  Having exhibited since the mid-1990s, Neri maintains a stimulating artistic practice through a commitment to experimentation. Throughout her career, she has explored the possibilities in paint (oil, acrylic, spray), plaster, and clay - her current work is a visual culmination of those explorations. Neri deftly combines elements of figuration, abstraction, graffiti, and folk art through clay, plaster, and paint to create complex, expressive and kinetic sculptures. Neri's most recent accomplishment is her inclusion in the book, ‚ÄúVitamin C: Clay and Ceramic in Contemporary Art‚Äù, published in 2017. The book is a global survey of one hundred of today's leading clay and ceramic artists - Neri is included alongside notable artists such as Anders Ruhwald, Edmund de Waal, Theaster Gates, Ron Nagle, Grayson Perry, and Betty Woodman. In an interview conducted for Phaidon, the publishers of ‚ÄúVitamin C‚Äù, she notes the various ceramic artists she was surrounded by and exposed to throughout her childhood, including Richard Shaw, Viola Frey, Peter Voulkos, and Robert Arneson, amongst others. She also states that, ‚ÄúAlthough I was primarily a painter for many years, ceramics has been a major influence on how I approach materials and how I physically manipulate objects‚Äù. Despite and perhaps because of her lack of formal training in ceramics, Neri manipulates the material with a sense of naivety that demonstrates her belief that the history of ceramics is, like painting, ‚Äúoppressive‚Äù. Neri states in the same interview that she is currently most excited by the work of Viola Frey, citing the scale of Frey's monumental pieces and her fearlessness as a woman working amongst men as key inspirations.

The editors of Computer Games Magazine nominated Warlords Battlecry for their 2000 \\"Real-time Strategy Game of the Year\\" award. Sequels Two sequels were released: Warlords Battlecry II in 2002 and Warlords Battlecry III in 2004. Although released in different times, the three games essentially share the same 2D graphics engine, a gameplay closely resembling that of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness or StarCraft and have a high number of playable races/sides (ranging from the 9 of WBC 1, to the 12 of WBC II and the 16 of WBC III). The games feature a hero building system which preceded Warcraft III's own one and combine real time strategy elements with roleplaying elements (hero development, stats and skills), thus making its creator labelling the series as \\"roleplaying strategy\\" games. Although the games share the same basic gameplay and graphics engine, and the series is generally well received among Warlords fans and hunters, the community around them has always been small (but loyal), and no serious modding efforts have been done until the third installment was released, although all three installments ended up supported by community (Fan patchesUnofficial Patches om patches-scrolls.de) rather than developer patches and mods.

Design and development The Merlin was an evolution of earlier modification programs performed by Swearingen Aircraft. Ed Swearingen started the developments that led to the Merlin through gradual modifications to the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza and Queen Air business aircraft which he dubbed Excalibur. Then a hybrid aircraft was developed, with a new fuselage and vertical fin, mated to salvaged and modified (wet) Queen Air wings and horizontal tails, and Twin Bonanza landing gear. This was the SA26 Merlin, more-or-less a pressurized Excalibur but fitted with a different model engine, the Lycoming TIGO-540 6-cylinder geared piston engine. The TIGO 540 was used despite the fact that one of the reasons the IO-720 was used in the Excalibur was that the Queen Air series' IGSO-480 and IGSO-540 engines from the same manufacturer were so troublesome. The decision was soon made to offer increased engine power, which was achieved through installing two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-20 turboprop engines, resulting in the SA26-T Merlin IIA. Operational history SA26T Merlin IIB The prototype IIA took to the air for the first time on 13 April 1965, about fifteen months after the competing Beech Model 65-90 King Air (which was also derived from the Model 65 Queen Air). 36 Merlin IIA models were built before a follow-on model with Garrett AiResearch TPE-331-1 engines called the SA26-AT Merlin IIB entered production after AiResearch was appointed as distributor for the type.Fricker, John. \\"At the NBAA Convention, Part 2 - the turboprop types\\", Flight International, 16 October 1969, p.595 (online archive version). Retrieved: 15 December 2008 The TPE-331 became the definitive engine of all subsequent production Merlins and the longer-fuselage Metros that were to follow. The Australian Department of Civil Aviation (now the Civil Aviation Safety Authority) took delivery of four Merlin IIBs in 1969 and operated them for almost fifteen years.Department of Civil Aviation Airways Museum Swearingen Merlin page. The Merlin IIAs and IIBs were visually still obviously derivatives of the Queen Air, featuring as they did Queen Air tailplanes and wings with the same flat-top engine nacelles as the Excalibur Queen Airs; the airstair in the same place and of the same general design as the Queen Air; and the nose being especially similar, of the same general shape with access panels the same size, shape and location as those of the Queen Air. These visual similarities ended with the next model, the SA226-T Merlin III, which was placed in production in February 1972 after 87 Merlin IIBs were built. This had new wings and engine nacelles with inverted inlet Garrett engines (this again becoming a defining feature of all subsequent production models), new landing gear with two wheels on each leg, a redesigned horizontal tail mounted on the vertical fin instead of on the fuselage as in earlier modelsThis and subsequent Merlin and Metro models have a trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) usually used on jet aircraft, one of only two turboprop aircraft types to have this design feature. and a redesigned longer nose with room for a baggage compartment as well as the avionics found in the noses of Merlin II series aircraft. All of these design changes came from the Metro design, which was undergoing development in the late 1960s. The SA226-TC Metro was more-or-less a new design, conceptually a stretch of the Merlin II (which it superficially resembled) sized to seat 22 passengers. Prototype construction of the Metro began in 1968 and first flight was on 26 August 1969. The standard engines offered were two TPE331-3UW turboprops driving three-bladed propellers. A corporate version called the SA226-AT Merlin IV was also marketed and initially sales of this version were roughly double that of the Metro.Based on production dates in the Metro production list accessed via this Website . These sales were not immediately forthcoming however, as the company was financially stretched by the development of the Metro prototype and lacked the funds to gear up for production. This situation was rectified in late 1971 when Ed Swearingen agreed to sell 90% of the company to Fairchild; the company was then renamed Swearingen Aviation Corporation. By the end of 1972 six Merlin IVs had been builtTurboprop Production Lists Home Page Metro production list accessed via this site September 3, 2007 and production gradually built up alongside the concurrently produced short- fuselage Merlin III. In 1974, the original Merlin IV and Metro models were replaced by the SA226-AT Merlin IVA and the SA226-TC Metro II after about 30 Merlin IVs and about 20 Metros had been built.The article \\"Final Metro Delivery\\" in Airways magazine Issue 64 states that Metro deliveries before the Metro II was introduced totalled 18. The Metro production list shows that by the end of 1974 22 Merlins had been built. However a photo on Airliners.net (here) of the 33rd Merlin IVA built (Fairchild c/n AT-038, built in 1975), shows it to have the earlier round windows. Among the changes made were larger, ovalised rectangular windows replacing the circular porthole-style windows of the early aircraft, and optional provision for a small Rocket- Assisted Take Off (RATO) rocket in the tail cone, this being offered to improve takeoff performance out of \\"hot & high\\" airfields. The same year the Merlin III was replaced by the SA226-T Merlin IIIA, with an extra window on the right side of the cabin and a small window aft of the airstair on each side of the fuselage. Customers for the Merlin IIIA included the Argentinian Air Force, the Argentine Army and the Belgian Air Force. SA227-TT Merlin IIIC In January 1979 production of the Merlin IIIA ended in favour of the SA226-T(B) Merlin IIIB. The IIIB differed mainly by TPE331-10U engines of increased power driving four-bladed propellers turning in the opposite direction to those of earlier models. The SA227-TT Merlin IIIC was next, introduced concurrently with the SA227-AC Metro III (the first Metro III was Fairchild c/n AC-420 and the first Merlin IIIC was c/n TT-421, Metro and Merlin aircraft at this stage being numbered consecutively with different prefixes to denote the different types), and the SA227-AT Merlin IVC version of the Metro III followed shortly after (the first Merlin IVC was c/n AT-423). The Merlin IIIC was a redesign to incorporate structural and other changes but was visually the same as the Merlin IIIB, the redesign taking place to make the aircraft compliant with Special Federal Aviation Regulation 41 (SFAR-41). The Merlin IVC version was initially certified in 1980 at up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) this increasing to 14,500 pounds (6,577 kg) as engines and structures were upgraded. An option to go as high as 16,000 pounds (7,257 kg) was offered. Other improvements incorporated into the Merlin IVC were a 10 ft (3.05 m) increase in wing span (achieved by the simple expedient of removing the wingtips from the Metro II wing, bolting an extension to the end of each wing, and fitting a new wingtip, redesigned to reduce drag), TPE331-11U engines with redesigned \\"quick-access\\" engine cowlings and driving four-bladed propellers as on the Merlin IIIB, and other drag-reducing airframe modifications including landing gear doors that close after the gear is extended. The US Army bought a second-hand Merlin IVC and operated it as the solitary UC-26C. Towards the end of production of the short-fuselage variants of the Merlin, optional winglets were offered. Ten of the last 25 SA227-TTs were built with the winglets as Merlin 300s. Production of short-fuselage Merlins ended in 1983 with the building of Merlin IIIC c/n TT-541. The last Merlin IVC (c/n AT-695B) was built in 1987 and Metro production ended in 1998.\\"Final Metro Delivery.\\" Airways magazine Vol. 8, No. 4; Issue 64, June 2001, p. 32.

History After a failed attempt in the late 80s to write an album together, Glenn Hughes and Joe Lynn Turner again joined forces in 2001 and started writing and recording an album. The album was released in February 2002 and focuses on the hard rock that both musicians are known for as well as a more AOR sound that is indicative of Turner's output and funk leanings, in a similar vein to Hughes‚Äô solo albums. Hughes‚Äô regular guitarist JJ Marsh plays on the album and co-wrote the majority of the tracks. The album also features performances from drummer Shane Gaalaas and keyboardist Vince DiCola. Guest guitarists include former Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy man John Sykes, Mr Big and former Racer X member Paul Gilbert and Japanese player Akira Kajiyama. Both Hughes and Turner have solo vocal showcases; Turner sings alone on the track Mystery of the Heart, while Hughes' takes centre stage on Heaven's Missing An Angel (which features John Sykes).

The southern terminus is at the Maryland state line in Elk Lick Township, where Maryland Route 669 (MD 669) and Springs Road cross the state line from U.S. Route 40 Alternate (US 40 Alt.). The route heads along Springs Road and Ord Street through its rural and residential alignment. The northern terminus is at the intersection with US 219 (Grant Street) in the borough of Salisbury. The route was designated in 1963, and a renumbered MD 417 was soon matched up over the state line in Maryland.  Route description  PA 669 begins at the state line as a continuation of MD 669 in the community of Elk Lick Township, Pennsylvania. The route progresses northward as Springs Road, passing through the rural regions of southern central Pennsylvania. This section of Somerset County is home to the Somerset Amish Settlement. Around the intersection with Ash Hill Road, the highway passes a light demographic of homes, but as PA 669 turns to the northwest at Upper Springs Road, begins to grow. The highway enters the community of Springs, Pennsylvania, a portion of Elk Lick Township. Through Springs, PA 669 becomes surrounded by light forestry and residences, turning to the north once again at an intersection with Shoemaker Hill Road. For a short stretch after Shoemaker Hill Road, PA 669 becomes a rural highway, crossing through fields. However, this changes as the highway enters the community of Niverton. In Niverton, PA 669 passes some residences and a large lumber yard, but after curving eastward at Fisher Road and Savage Road, Springs Road and PA 669 return to their rural nature. PA 669 westward does continue eastward through Niverton, but soon turns southeastward into a short residential portion surrounded by fields. At the intersection with Oak Dale Road, the highway begins a curve back to the northeast, entering the small community of Sylvan Lane soon after. In Sylvan Lane, PA 669 continues its small community nature, and continues northeastward through rural Somerset County before entering Salisbury. After making a large curve to the north, the highway continues through rural Salisbury, paralleling the Casselman River. PA 669 enters West Salisbury and intersects with Saint Paul Road, where the highway turns eastward on a bridge across the river. After crossing the river, PA 669 becomes known as Ord Street and enters downtown Salisbury. There, the highway passes several residences before intersecting and terminating at an intersection with US 219 (Grant Street). Ord Street continues eastward until changing names to Engles Mills Road soon after.  History  During the 1930s, the Maryland Department of Highways began the modernization of Springs Road on their side of the border to basic state highway standards. PA 669 was first designated along its current alignment in 1963 from the Maryland state line to the borough of Salisbury and the intersection with US 219; the connecting road in Maryland was renumbered from MD 417 to MD 669. The two bridges PA 669 uses to cross waterways in Salisbury and West Salisbury have both been deemed structurally deficient by the United States Department of Transportation. The one over the Casselman River in Salisbury was constructed in 1922 and handles an average of 1,469 vehicles per day. The second bridge, the one over Tub Mill Run in West Salisbury is in similar shape, but constructed three years later.

G 7th US Cavalry, killed by Native American Indians in Kansas on 26 June 1867 Dr. William Abraham Bell (26 April 1841 ‚Äì 6 June 1921) was an English physician who is best known as a photographer of the American West, and a founder and developer of several businesses and towns in Colorado, including Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs, and Durango. Early life Bell was born in Ireland in 1841, the son of an English physician named William Bell. He studied medicine at Cambridge University and practised at St George's Hospital in London after earning his medical degree. Kansas Pacific Railway survey In 1867, Bell travelled to the United States to study the medical principles of homoeopathy in St. Louis. In the United States, he joined an expedition undertaken by the Union Pacific Railroad Eastern Division (later Kansas Pacific Railway) to identify and map a southern route for a railroad connection between Kansas and California. Although Bell had no experience in photography, he was recommended for the post of expedition photographer by the expedition's geologist, John Lawrence LeConte. Accordingly, he undertook a two-week crash course in photography, purchased a camera and darkroom equipment, and joined the expedition in western Kansas, in a region near the Colorado state line that was the scene of active fighting between local Indians and United States military forces. Soon after his arrival in Kansas, Bell saw and photographed the mutilated body of Sergeant Frederick Wyllyams, a U.S. soldier who had been killed by Indians. The gruesome image was published in Harper's Weekly, which railroad officials considered to be bad publicity and which caused them to become concerned that Bell intended to make money from sale of expedition photos. The railroad hired Alexander Gardner to be chief photographer for the survey expedition. However, the expedition split into two parties, and for a time Bell continued his photographic work as a member of the southern party that scouted a route through New Mexico and west along the 32nd parallel, while Gardner was part of the northern party that followed the 35th parallel. As an expedition member, Bell formed a friendship with the expedition's leader, General William J. Palmer, who was later to become his partner in several business ventures. After about six months' work, Bell separated from the expedition at Camp Grant in southern Arizona, abandoning his equipment and negatives to travel on horseback to the coast of Mexico. From there, he travelled by ship to San Francisco and made an overland crossing of the United States to return to the east coast, where he obtained passage back to England. He described his experience in the survey expedition in an 1869 book, New Tracks in North America. Published at a time when few Americans had seen the country west of the Mississippi River, the book sold well in both Great Britain and the United States. Meanwhile, the approximately 100 photographs that he left with the expedition were of little use to the railroad, whose officials found that they were carelessly finished and that many of them had insufficient lighting. Only two of his images were included in the compilation that Alexander Gardner produced after the conclusion of the expedition. Some of his photographic work survives in collections, including those of the Colorado Historical Society. Business activities in Colorado Palmer and Bell shared a vision of building a corporate empire and formed a business partnership. Both were astute businessmen and complemented each other. Together they founded the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, and Bell and Palmer went on to found some 30 businesses. After the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built a spur into Manitou Springs, an aggressive marketing campaign was started to promote the health benefits of the resort, which was successful and came to be known as \\"Saratoga of the West\\", making an analogy to Saratoga Springs, New York. In early 1872 Bell visited England, where he married Cara Scovell. In the summer of that year, he returned to Colorado with his new wife and they started construction of a new Victorian home on the banks of Fountain Creek in Manitou Springs. Their home, known as Briarhurst Manor, was completed in 1876. Easterners and investors from England arrived in a steady stream, and an entire community sprang up around the fashionable health resort. The town was designed like a European spa with luxury hotels, parks and shops. The hotels provided entertainment, hiring the popular bands of the day for dances. Wealthy visitors often brought their families and household staff and stayed for months at a time. Final years By 1890, Bell had liquidated many of his holdings in the United States, whereupon he retired to England, entrusting the Briarhurst Estate to a pair of long-term employees. In March 1909, Bell was called back to America when his partner, General Palmer, died following an extended struggle with spinal paralysis resulting from a riding accident. The Bells paid a last visit to Briarhurst and their Manitou resort in March 1920. Dr. Bell announced to newspaper reporters that this would be his last trip, saying he was no longer able to take the long sea voyage back and forth to England. On 6 June 1921, Bell died at the age of 81 of a heart condition. Cara lived until 1938, to the age of 85. Works * William A.

Bell House, is a finely grained pink Victorian sandstone manor house listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the city of Manitou Springs, Colorado. It is the second building on this site. Construction of the original Briarhurst began in 1872. Dr. William Bell, the home's owner, left for England to marry a woman named Cara, who agreed to live with Bell in Colorado as long as her children were born in England. The Tudor Revival style home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Fountain Creek passes through the estate and the home is in the shadow of Pikes Peak. Under Mrs. Cara Bell's direction, Briarhurst became \\"the social center\\" of the community, hosting the internationally famous of the day, President Grant, President Teddy Roosevelt and Oscar Wilde after his lecture in Colorado Springs in 1882. On occasion, a tribe of friendly Utes camped on the Briarhurst estate grounds while preparing to go into the Garden of the Gods, for them a holy place of worship. One winter night in 1886, while Dr. Bell was away on business, Mrs. Bell awoke to a bedroom filled with smoke. Burning embers escaped from a fireplace in Briarhurst. She woke the children and servants. Cara stayed in the burning house and with the help of gardener Schneider, they rescued a prized oil painting by Thomas Moran, the \\"Mount of the Holy Cross\\". The family escaped safely, but lost all of their belongings and returned to England. They returned in early 1887 to begin reconstruction of a second, more elaborate Briarhurst Manor, complete with schoolroom, conservatory, cloister and a library with a special alcove to display the \\"Mount of the Holy Cross.\\" Today, of the original Briarhurst estate is a restaurant and event venue. The restaurant seats over 400 guests and features Colorado cuisine. About 2 acres of the old estate is used for a large warehouse building and the Blue Skies Inn Bed and Breakfast utilizing the original 1873 carriage house and 4 other buildings. Hundreds of weddings and receptions are celebrated in the Briarhurst gardens created by Dr Bell's gardener Ferdinand Schneider over a hundred years ago.

It operated between May and November 1999. CityJet was launched when Tranzglobal Holdings, a freight airline operator, decided to establish a low-cost passenger service, competing with Air New Zealand, Ansett New Zealand, and Origin Pacific Airways. It was set up by Paul Webb and Steve Mosen. CityJet operated in the Cook Strait area, having a hub in Wellington and serving Nelson, Blenheim, and Palmerston North. Auckland, Hamilton, New Zealand and later Christchurch were served. The airline's fleet was based on the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante. The airline operated passenger flights during the day then removed the seats to operate freight flights at night. The airfares were very cheap at only $29 and undercut the cheapest at Air New Zealand and Ansett New Zealand which were $89 at the time. The fares were also cheaper than the three ferry operators; The new Top Cat service had a $35 introductory fare, Cook Strait Sea Cat's fare was $49, while the Interislander fare cost $46 and the Lynx fast ferry $59. In October 1999, the Civil Aviation Authority grounded CityJet's aircraft after allegations of irregularities in the recording of flight times. Some flights continued using chartered aircraft, but in November, the airline's pilots were placed under restrictions.

It was once quite widely grown near Auxerre. History In the early 19th century, Roublot made up a third of the area in Saint-Bris-le- Vineux in the west of Chablis. Then the vines were wiped out in the phylloxera epidemic, and uniquely for Burgundy, were replaced by Sauvignon blanc, the wines of which today are designated Saint-Bris AOC. DNA fingerprinting has shown that Roublot is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais blanc (Heunisch) and Pinot, making it a full sibling of famous varieties such as Chardonnay and Aligot√©. Gouais blanc was widely grown by the French peasantry in the Medieval ages. This offered many opportunities for hybridization, and the offspring benefited from hybrid vigor as the parents were genetically quite different. Other Gouais blanc/Pinot crosses include Aubin vert, Auxerrois, Bachet noir, Beaunoir, Franc Noir de la Haute-Sa√¥ne, Gamay Blanc Gloriod, Gamay, Melon, Knipperl√©, Peurion, Romorantin, Roublot, and Sacy. The synonym C√©sar blanc may reflect a traditional link with the ancient red grape C√©sar, a Pinot/Argant cross. Viticulture Like many Pinot/Gouais crosses, Roublot is quite vigorous, with small bunches. It is a very unreliable yielder, thanks to its high susceptibility to powdery mildew and grey rot.

His son E. Lysle Aschaffenburg, resurrected the concept in 1926, but chose a site on St. Charles Ave. and Josephine St. nearer the city's residential districts. For approximately $1 million, the building was completed in 1927 and opened as a residential hotel. It did not take Lysle long to realize that there was not much incentive for New Orleanians to give up their homes to live in apartments and gradually converted most the units for traditional hotel use. The Pontchartrain shortly thereafter became a preferred destination for visitors; but, it always retained a small percentage of apartments for residents on an annual lease. Lysle's son, Albert (Jr.), after serving overseas in WWII and living in New York to pursue a theater career, returned to New Orleans to join the family business and eventually take the helm of its operation. Realizing that to be considered a great hotel, a hotel must have a great restaurant, the Caribbean Room was created in 1948. Modeled after Chicago's famous Pump Room, the Caribbean Room with its classical French approach in menu and service was at first, not well received locally. The Aschaffenburg's retained the luxurious d√©cor; but, quickly changed the direction of the restaurant to become a mainstay of local Creole cuisine with a warmer style of service. Through the years, the hotel's understated elegance and extraordinary service provided by its owner/managers appealed to sophisticated visitors that were part of the cognoscenti; but, it also was embraced by New Orleanians that felt the Pontchartrain was a physical manifestation of local traditional culture. New Orleanians were possessive about the Pontchartrain, its Silver Whistle Coffee Shop, the Caribbean Room and the Bayou Bar and in turn the hotel reflected their collective personality. Running the hotel became more of an avocation than a vocation for the Aschaffenburgs and Lysle often said (tongue in cheek) it was the easiest business in the world because your guests will tell you exactly how things should be done. Noted guests of the Hotel Ponchartrain include Cole Porter, Charles Laughton, Evelyn Waugh, Lord Litchfield, Mary Martin, Richard Burton, Joshua Logan, Henry Kissinger, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Rudolph Nureyev, James Beard, Tennessee Williams, (Staggs, 2005) Jose Ferrer, Rita Hayworth and Aga Khan (Frommer, 2007), The Doors (Densmore, 1990), and George H. W. Bush. Williams worked on his classic play A Streetcar Named Desire while staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel. (Staggs, 2005) The Aschaffenburg family sold the Pontchartrain in the late 1980s. During the more than 60 years of the family's ownership and management, the Pontchartrain and its Caribbean Room restaurant received many honors: top rating in the Guide Julliard de Paris, Harpers & Queens 200 Best Hotels in the World, The IFMA Gold Plate award, Nation's Restaurant News Hall of Fame, a charter member of Preferred Hotels Worldwide and it was a perennial Holiday Magazine award winner. Closing of the hotel and repurposing of the building The 80-year-old hotel building closed for extensive renovations in July 2007. In July 2008, it was reported that the building would be converted into a residence for retirees. 2010s - Returning as a Hotel In August 2013, the Pontchartrain reopened as a hotel, and its historic Bayou Bar reopened in February 2014. In November 2014, the Pontchartrain Hotel was acquired by AJ Capital Partners, with Cooper Manning as a part-owner. It underwent another, more ambitious renovation aimed at restoring it to its former grandeur and re-emphasizing its historic character. Its 106 guestrooms and suites were updated to appeal to a younger generation of travelers. Celebrity chef John Besh and his staff were chosen to run the Caribbean Room and all of the hotel's dining operations. Besh's company left the Pontchartrain in January 2018. As of January 2018 all of the hotel's restaurants were operated by QED Hospitality. The hotel reopened again on June 17, 2016, along with the Caribbean Room, Bayou Bar, and Silver Whistle coffee shop,. Additionally, a new rooftop bar, Hot Tin, has been created on the 14th story of the hotel, overlooking the New Orleans skyline and Mississippi River.

The route is a two-lane undivided road that runs through rural areas in the northern part of Wayne County. PA 670 heads northwest from PA 191 and passes through Bethany. Farther northwest, the route crosses PA 247 and intersects the northern terminus of PA 170 before turning west to run concurrent with PA 371 in Pleasant Mount. PA 670 turns north from PA 371 and continues to its end at PA 370 in Orson. The route follows the alignment of two turnpikes chartered in the 19th century. The southern portion of the route follows the Bethany and Honesdale Turnpike chartered in 1831 while the section north of Pleasant Mount follows the Belmont and Easton Turnpike, which continued south to Easton, which was chartered in 1812 and completed in 1820. The road in the Pleasant Mount area was designated as part of PA 170 in 1928. By 1930, PA 670 was designated between PA 170 (now PA 371) in Pleasant Mount and PA 370 in Orson. The route was extended southeast to PA 90 (now PA 191) north of Honesdale in the 1930s, replacing the section of PA 170 through Pleasant Mount.

The road heads through wooded areas with some homes, crossing into Dyberry Township. Here, the route becomes Bethany Turnpike and continues through more wooded areas with some fields and residences, turning north. PA 670 enters Bethany, where it becomes Wayne Street and passes homes, turning northwest. The road heads back into Dyberry Township and becomes Bethany Turnpike again, heading north through woodland with some fields and residences. The route turns northwest and runs through more rural areas, crossing into Mount Pleasant Township and coming to an intersection with PA 247. PA 670 runs through more farmland and woodland with homes, passing through Whites Valley and intersecting the northern terminus of PA 170. The road continues northwest to an intersection with PA 371 in Pleasant Mount. At this point, PA 670 turns west to form a concurrency with PA 371 on Great Bend Turnpike, heading west through more rural areas. In Belmont Corner, PA 670 splits from PA 371 by turning north onto Belmont Turnpike, running through more farms and woods with residences. PA 670 continues northeast and north through more rural areas, entering Preston Township and ending at an intersection with PA 370 in Orson. History The section of PA 670 north of PA 371 follows part of the alignment of the Belmont and Easton Turnpike, a turnpike that was chartered on March 15, 1812 to run along the North and South road between the Easton and Wilkes-Barre Turnpike in Northampton County and the community of Belmont in Mount Pleasant Township, Wayne County. The turnpike was completed in 1819-1820. The Belmont and Easton Turnpike was used to transport cattle and sheep from Western New York to Easton and Philadelphia. The turnpike saw heavy traffic in its early days but traffic would decline with the rise of the railroads and other roads. The southern portion of PA 670 was chartered as the Bethany and Honesdale Turnpike on March 25, 1831, connecting Bethany and Honesdale. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 670 was not given a number. In 1928,the present route between Honesdale and southeast of Pleasant Mount was an unnumbered paved road while the stretch southeast of and through Pleasant Mount was designated as part of PA 170. PA 670 was designated by 1930 to run from PA 170 (now PA 371) in Pleasant Mount north to PA 370 in Orson. At this time, the route was under construction. In the 1930s, PA 670 was extended southeast to PA 90 (now PA 191) north of Honesdale, replacing the stretch of PA 170 through Pleasant Mount. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved.

Biography Abraham Shalom Yahuda was born in Jerusalem to a Jewish family originally from Baghdad. During his early life he studied under his brother Isaac Ezekial Yahuda. In 1895, at the age of fifteen, he wrote his first book (in Hebrew) entitled Arab Antiquities. Two years later, in 1897 he attended the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. Afterwards he began teaching in Berlin from 1905 to 1914. Later, during the First World War, he relocated to Madrid where he was appointed in 1915, by royal decree, chair of rabbinic languages and literature Michael Rose Friedman, Orientalism between Empires:Abraham Shalom Yahuda at the Intersection of Sepharad, Zionism, and Imperialism Jewish Quarterly Review Vol. 109, No. 3, Summer 2019 pp. 435‚Äì451,p.438. After a fall- out with Chaim Weizmann over Zionist attitudes to Arabs, he joined Zeev Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionist Movement, and was thereafter actively sponsored by the latter. Eventually Yahuda would relocate once again to New York and continue his career at the New School for Social Research. During his lifetime Yahuda was a notable linguist and writer, translating and interpreting many ancient Arabic documents including various works of pre- Islamic poetry and medieval Judeo-Arabic texts. In 1935 he published The Accuracy of the Bible, a work which would spark a significant amount of international discussion.Ammiel Alcalay, 'Intellectual Life,' in Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer (eds.), The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times, Columbia University Press, 2003 pp.85-111, p.87 His book Dr. Weizmann's Errors on Trial was published posthumously in New York in 1952. This work was a scathing result of the slight he felt in being anonymously referred to in Chaim Weizmann's memoirs (Trial and Error: The Autobiography of Chaim Weizmann,) as a Spanish professor of marrano background. Upon his death many of Yahuda's vast collection of rare documents were donated to the Jewish National and University Library, amounting to about fifteen hundred documents. Much of the donated material was of Arabic origin, however, several hundred items were in ancient Hebrew as well. Also included were a number of documents from other countries, including a number of illuminated manuscripts and unpublished documents penned by Sir Isaac Newton. The collection of 7,500 handwritten theological papers was granted recognition within UNESCO's \\"Memory of the World\\" registry, recognizing documents which should be preserved for future generations. Cultural influences In his 1993 play Hysteria, British playwright Terry Johnson created a character partly based on Yahuda's attempt to convince Sigmund Freud not to publish his final book, Moses and Monotheism.

The rebellion was initiated by Meng Da, a former Shu Han general who defected to Wei and was placed in charge of Xincheng Commandery (located in the vicinity of present-day northwestern Hubei) in Jing Province. The revolt was swiftly suppressed within a month by the Wei general Sima Yi. Meng Da was captured and executed. Background In 220, Meng Da, a general who formerly served the warlord Liu Bei, defected over to Liu's rival Cao Pi, who had inherited the title of a vassal king ‚Äì \\"King of Wei\\" ‚Äì from his recently deceased father, Cao Cao. Meng Da brought along his subordinates and their families, numbering over 4,000 in total. Cao Pi was pleased when he heard that Meng Da had come to join him, and he gave Meng a warm welcome. Cao Pi appointed Meng Da as the Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Xincheng (Êñ∞Âüé) Commandery, which was located along the southwestern border of Wei.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÈÅî‰ª•Âª∂Â∫∑ÂÖÉÂπ¥ÁéáÈÉ®Êõ≤ÂõõÂçÉÈ§òÂÆ∂Ê≠∏È≠è„ÄÇÊñáÂ∏ùÊôÇÂàùÂç≥Áéã‰ΩçÔºåÊó¢ÂÆøÁü•ÊúâÈÅîÔºåËÅûÂÖ∂‰æÜÔºåÁîöÊÇÖÔºå‰ª§Ë≤¥Ëá£ÊúâË≠òÂØüËÄÖÂæÄËßÄ‰πãÔºåÈÇÑÊõ∞„ÄåÂ∞áÂ∏•‰πãÊâç‰πü„ÄçÔºåÊàñÊõ∞„ÄåÂçøÁõ∏‰πãÂô®‰πü„ÄçÔºåÁéãÁõäÊ¨ΩÈÅî„ÄÇ ...

Throughout Meng Da's service in Xincheng, he had been friendly with Eastern Wu (a state founded by Sun Quan) and had established strong defences against possible attacks from Wei's rival state Shu Han (founded by Liu Bei). Shu's chancellor-regent, Zhuge Liang, hated Meng Da for being capricious, and was also worried that Meng would become a threat to Shu.(ÈÅîÊñºÊòØÈÄ£Âê≥Âõ∫ËúÄÔºåÊΩõÂúñ‰∏≠Âúã„ÄÇËúÄÁõ∏Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÊÉ°ÂÖ∂ÂèçË¶ÜÔºåÂèàÊÖÆÂÖ∂ÁÇ∫ÊÇ£„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1. Rebellion There are two accounts of Meng Da's motive for rebelling, both of which are generally similar but there are some slight differences. The first account is from the Weil√ºe while the second is from the Book of Jin (Jin Shu). The Weil√ºe account mentioned that Zhuge Liang planned to induce Meng Da to defect to Shu when he heard that Meng was feeling uneasy in Xincheng. Zhuge Liang wrote several letters to Meng Da and the latter replied. Shen Yi (Áî≥ÂÑÄ), the Administrator of Weixing (È≠èËàà; around present-day Shiquan County in Shaanxi and Yunxi County in Hubei), who had disagreements with Meng Da, secretly reported to the Wei imperial court that Meng was having dealings with Shu, but the Wei emperor Cao Rui refused to believe. Sima Yi, who was stationed at Wan at that time, sent an advisor Liang Ji (Ê¢ÅÂπæ) to investigate and also urged him to travel to the capital Luoyang. Meng Da became suspicious and feared for his life, so he rebelled.(Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆËÅû‰πãÔºåÈô∞Ê¨≤Ë™òÈÅîÔºåÊï∏Êõ∏Êãõ‰πãÔºåÈÅîËàáÁõ∏Â†±Á≠î„ÄÇÈ≠èËààÂ§™ÂÆàÁî≥ÂÑÄËàáÈÅîÊúâÈöôÔºåÂØÜË°®ÈÅîËàáËúÄÊΩõÈÄöÔºåÂ∏ùÊú™‰πã‰ø°‰πü„ÄÇÂè∏È¶¨ÂÆ£ÁéãÈÅ£ÂèÉËªçÊ¢ÅÂπæÂØü‰πãÔºåÂèàÂã∏ÂÖ∂ÂÖ•Êúù„ÄÇÈÅîÈ©öÊáºÔºåÈÅÇÂèç„ÄÇ) Weil√ºe annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 3. The Jin Shu account confirmed that Meng Da did have a feud with Shen Yi. Zhuge Liang planned to make use of this incident to lure Meng Da to defect to Shu sooner, so he sent Guo Mo (ÈÉ≠Ê®°) to feign surrender to Wei and divulge Meng's plan to Shen Yi. When Meng Da heard that the plot had been leaked out, he immediately made plans for a rebellion. Sima Yi, who was at Wan at that time, became worried that Meng Da would proceed with the revolt quickly, so he wrote a letter to Meng to calm him down. Sima Yi wrote, \\"General, you previously left Liu Bei and dedicated yourself to our state. Our state entrusted you with the duty of guarding the border and tasked you with planning an invasion on Shu. This is an obvious sign that our state trusts you. The people of Shu are fools and they hate you deeply. Zhuge Liang wants you back in Shu only because he has no other choice. What Guo Mo told Shen Yi is not a small issue. Why would Zhuge Liang so easily ask him to reveal your plot? This dangerous move is not difficult to comprehend.\\" Meng Da was pleased when he received Sima Yi's letter, and he entered a dilemma on whether to rebel or not. During this time, Sima Yi secretly led his forces from Wan towards Xincheng. Sima Yi's subordinates suggested that they observe Meng Da's actions first before advancing, but Sima replied, \\"(Meng) Da is not a trustworthy person. Now that he is hesitating due to suspicions, we should seize this opportunity to get rid of him.\\" Sima Yi's army then advanced quickly and reached Xincheng within eight days.(ÈÅîËàáÈ≠èËààÂ§™ÂÆàÁî≥ÂÑÄÊúâÈöôÔºå‰∫ÆÊ¨≤‰øÉÂÖ∂‰∫ãÔºå‰πÉÈÅ£ÈÉ≠Ê®°Ë©êÈôçÔºåÈÅéÂÑÄÔºåÂõ†ÊºèÊ≥ÑÂÖ∂Ë¨Ä„ÄÇÈÅîËÅûÂÖ∂Ë¨ÄÊºèÊ≥ÑÔºåÂ∞áËàâÂÖµ„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊÅêÈÅîÈÄüÁôºÔºå‰ª•Êõ∏Âñª‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ∞áËªçÊòîÊ£ÑÂäâÂÇôÔºåË®óË∫´ÂúãÂÆ∂ÔºåÂúãÂÆ∂ÂßîÂ∞áËªç‰ª•ÁñÜÂü∏‰πã‰ªªÔºå‰ªªÂ∞áËªç‰ª•ÂúñËúÄ‰πã‰∫ãÔºåÂèØË¨ÇÂøÉË≤´ÁôΩÊó•„ÄÇËúÄ‰∫∫ÊÑöÊô∫ÔºåËé´‰∏çÂàáÈΩíÊñºÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÊ¨≤Áõ∏Á†¥ÔºåÊÉüËã¶ÁÑ°Ë∑ØËÄ≥„ÄÇÊ®°‰πãÊâÄË®ÄÔºåÈùûÂ∞è‰∫ã‰πüÔºå‰∫ÆË±àËºï‰πãËÄå‰ª§ÂÆ£Èú≤ÔºåÊ≠§ÊÆÜÊòìÁü•ËÄ≥„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅîÂæóÊõ∏Â§ßÂñúÔºåÁå∂Ëàá‰∏çÊ±∫„ÄÇÂ∏ù‰πÉÊΩõËªçÈÄ≤Ë®é„ÄÇË´∏Â∞áË®ÄÈÅîËàá‰∫åË≥ä‰∫§ÊßãÔºåÂÆúËßÄÊúõËÄåÂæåÂãï„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈÅîÁÑ°‰ø°Áæ©ÔºåÊ≠§ÂÖ∂Áõ∏Áñë‰πãÊôÇ‰πüÔºåÁï∂ÂèäÂÖ∂Êú™ÂÆö‰øÉÊ±∫‰πã„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÂÄçÈÅìÂÖºË°åÔºåÂÖ´Êó•Âà∞ÂÖ∂Âüé‰∏ã„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1.

Before the battle, Meng Da wrote to Zhuge Liang, \\"Wan is 800 li away from Luoyang, while I'm 1,200 li away from Luoyang. When (Sima Yi) learns that I'm plotting a rebellion, he'll inform the emperor (Cao Rui). The total time taken for Sima Yi to send a letter to Luoyang and receive a response is around a month. By then my city is fortified and my army is ready. As I'm in an advantageous position, Sima Yi will not dare to come and attack me. Once you arrive I'll have no worries.\\" However, eight days later, when Sima Yi's army had arrived, Meng Da wrote to Zhuge Liang again, \\"I plotted a rebellion. Within eight days (Sima Yi)'s army has reached my city. What godspeed is that?\\" Meng Da was based in Shangyong (‰∏äÂ∫∏), a city in Xincheng which was surrounded on three sides by water, so he set up wooden barriers to defend himself. Sima Yi's forces crossed the waters, destroyed the barriers, and arrived just outside Shangyong. Sima Yi then split up his army to attack Meng Da from eight directions. Sima Yi tempted Meng Da's nephew Deng Xian (ÈÑßË≥¢) and subordinate Li Fu (ÊùéËºî) into surrendering, which they did so by opening Shangyong's gates after sixteen days of siege. Meng Da was captured and executed, and his head was sent to the Wei capital Luoyang.(ÂàùÔºåÈÅîËàá‰∫ÆÊõ∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÆõÂéªÊ¥õÂÖ´ÁôæÈáåÔºåÂéªÂêæ‰∏ÄÂçÉ‰∫åÁôæÈáåÔºåËÅûÂêæËàâ‰∫ãÔºåÁï∂Ë°®‰∏äÂ§©Â≠êÔºåÊØîÁõ∏ÂèçË¶ÜÔºå‰∏ÄÊúàÈñì‰πüÔºåÂâáÂêæÂüéÂ∑≤Âõ∫ÔºåË´∏ËªçË∂≥Ëæ¶„ÄÇÂâáÂêæÊâÄÂú®Ê∑±Èö™ÔºåÂè∏È¶¨ÂÖ¨ÂøÖ‰∏çËá™‰æÜÔºõË´∏Â∞á‰æÜÔºåÂêæÁÑ°ÊÇ£Áü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂèäÂÖµÂà∞ÔºåÈÅîÂèàÂëä‰∫ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæËàâ‰∫ãÂÖ´Êó•ÔºåËÄåÂÖµËá≥Âüé‰∏ãÔºå‰ΩïÂÖ∂Á•ûÈÄü‰πüÔºÅ„Äç‰∏äÂ∫∏Âüé‰∏âÈù¢ÈòªÊ∞¥ÔºåÈÅîÊñºÂüéÂ§ñÁÇ∫Êú®Êüµ‰ª•Ëá™Âõ∫„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊ∏°Ê∞¥ÔºåÁ†¥ÂÖ∂ÊüµÔºåÁõ¥ÈÄ†Âüé‰∏ã„ÄÇÂÖ´ÈÅìÊîª‰πãÔºåÊó¨ÊúâÂÖ≠Êó•ÔºåÈÅîÁî•ÈÑßË≥¢„ÄÅÂ∞áÊùéËºîÁ≠âÈñãÈñÄÂá∫Èôç„ÄÇÊñ¨ÈÅîÔºåÂÇ≥È¶ñ‰∫¨Â∏´„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1.(‰∫åÂπ¥Êò•Ê≠£ÊúàÔºåÂÆ£ÁéãÊîªÁ†¥Êñ∞ÂüéÔºåÊñ¨ÈÅîÔºåÂÇ≥ÂÖ∂È¶ñ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 3.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÂÆ£ÁéãË™òÈÅîÂ∞áÊùéËºîÂèäÈÅîÁî•ÈÑßË≥¢ÔºåË≥¢Á≠âÈñãÈñÄÁ¥çËªç„ÄÇÈÅîË¢´ÂúçÊó¨ÊúâÂÖ≠Êó•ËÄåÊïóÔºåÁÑöÂÖ∂È¶ñÊñºÊ¥õÈôΩÂõõÈÅî‰πãË°¢„ÄÇ) Weil√ºe annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 3.

Sima Yi sent a messenger to taunt Shen Yi, so Shen came to meet Sima Yi, who questioned him about the distribution of unauthorised official seals but released him later.(ÂàùÔºåÁî≥ÂÑÄ‰πÖÂú®È≠èËààÔºåÂ∞àÂ®ÅÁñÜÂü∏ÔºåËºíÊâøÂà∂ÂàªÂç∞ÔºåÂ§öÊâÄÂÅáÊéà„ÄÇÈÅîÊó¢Ë™ÖÔºåÊúâËá™ÁñëÂøÉ„ÄÇÊôÇË´∏ÈÉ°ÂÆà‰ª•Â∏ùÊñ∞ÂÖãÊç∑ÔºåÂ•âÁ¶ÆÊ±ÇË≥ÄÔºåÁöÜËÅΩ‰πã„ÄÇÂ∏ù‰Ωø‰∫∫Ë´∑ÂÑÄÔºåÂÑÄËá≥ÔºåÂïèÊâøÂà∂ÁãÄÔºåÂü∑‰πãÔºå ...)

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms The rebellion was mentioned in Chapter 94 of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which some fictitious elements were introduced for dramatic effect. ;The novel's account Meng Da invited Shen Yi (Áî≥ÂÑÄ), the Administrator of Jincheng (ÈáëÂüé), and Shen Dan (Áî≥ËÄΩ), the Administrator of Shangyong (‰∏äÂ∫∏), to join him in the rebellion. Shen Yi and Shen Dan pretended to agree as they were secretly planning to help the Wei army when it arrived to suppress the revolt. They lied to Meng Da that the preparations were insufficient, and Meng believed them. Sima Yi's messenger Liang Ji (Ê¢ÅÁïø) arrived at Xincheng and lied to Meng Da that Sima had led an army towards Chang'an to deal with an invasion by Shu Han. Meng Da was pleased and he threw a feast for Liang Ji and then saw Liang out of the city. He then gave orders to Shen Yi and Shen Dan to rebel on the following day. However, just then, he received reports that an army had arrived outside the city. Meng Da rushed to the city wall and saw that the army was commanded by Xu Huang, a veteran Wei general. Xu Huang called for Meng Da to surrender, but Meng fired an arrow which hit Xu in the forehead. Meng Da's archers then rained arrows on Xu Huang's men, forcing them to retreat. Xu Huang died from his arrow wound that night at the age of 59 (by East Asian age reckoning) and his body was placed in a coffin and sent to Luoyang for burial. By then, Sima Yi's main army had showed up outside Xincheng and completely surrounded the city. The following day, Meng Da saw Shen Yi and Shen Dan's forces arriving and he thought that they had come to help him. He opened the gates and led his men out to attack Sima Yi, but Shen Yi and Shen Dan shouted at him, \\"You rebel, don't try to escape! Quickly accept your death!\\" Meng Da sensed trouble and attempted to retreat back into the city, but his subordinates Li Fu (ÊùéËºî) and Deng Xian (ÈÑßË≥¢) had betrayed him and denied him entry. Shen Dan approached the exhausted Meng Da and killed him, and Meng's men surrendered. Sima Yi entered Xincheng and restored peace and order to the city. He reported his victory to the Wei emperor Cao Rui, who asked for Meng Da's head to be sent to Luoyang. Shen Yi and Shen Dan were promoted and ordered to accompany Sima Yi to deal with the Shu invasion, while Li Fu and Deng Xian were tasked with guarding Xincheng and Shangyong.(ÂçªË™™Â≠üÈÅîÂú®Êñ∞ÂüéÔºåÁ¥Ñ‰∏ãÈáëÂüéÂ§™ÂÆàÁî≥ÂÑÄ„ÄÅ‰∏äÂ∫∏Â§™ÂÆàÁî≥ËÄΩÔºåÂâãÊó•Ëàâ‰∫ã„ÄÇ ...

There is also no evidence that Xu Huang participated in suppressing the revolt. The Sanguozhi did not provide much details on his death. It simply stated that he died in the first year of the Taihe era (227‚Äì233) in the reign of Cao Rui.(Â§™ÂíåÂÖÉÂπ¥Ëñ®ÔºåË´°Êõ∞Â£Ø‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17. In popular culture The rebellion is featured as a playable stage in the Koei video game Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends, in which it is known as the \\"Battle of Xin Castle\\". The player can only play on the Wei side as Cao Pi, Sima Yi or Xu Huang, and must defeat Meng Da to win the stage. If the player is fast enough, the stage can be completed before Shu reinforcements arrive to help Meng Da. Notes References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.79\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXX Reserve Corps.In German military nomenclature, \\"40\\" was rendered as \\"XXXX\\" in Roman numerals rather than the more conventional \\"XL\\". The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. Two regiments of the division were raised through Prussian Guard recruit depots throughout the kingdom, while the third was raised in Prussian Saxony. Combat chronicle The 79th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. In 1915, it fought in the siege of Kovno and the battles on the Neman River and at Vilnius. From October 1915 to November 1916, the division was engaged in positional warfare, after which it was transferred to the Western Front. It was in reserve and then engaged in positional warfare in Flanders and the Artois until April 1917, when it fought in the Battle of Arras. Later in 1917, it fought in the Battles of Passchendaele and Cambrai. The division participated in the German 1918 Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also called the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It saw action in the Second Battle of the Marne and continued fighting against the various Allied offensives until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 537-540. Order of battle on formation The 79th Reserve Division, like the other divisions of its wave and unlike earlier German divisions, was organized from the outset as a triangular division. The order of battle of the division on December 29, 1914, was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935). *79.Reserve- Infanterie-Brigade **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 261 **Reserve-Infanterie- Regiment Nr. 262 **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 263 **Reserve-Radfahrer- Kompanie Nr. 79 *Reserve-Kavallerie-Abteilung Nr. 79 *79.Reserve- Feldartillerie-Brigade **Reserve-Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 63 **Reserve- Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 64 *Reserve-Pionier-Kompanie Nr. 81 Order of battle on February 23, 1918 The most significant wartime structural change in the divisions of this wave was the reduction from two field artillery regiments to one.

Nations and Nationalism 9.1, 129-147. Kristian Jaak Peterson gathered his Estonian poems into two small books but never saw them published, as this only occurred a hundred years after his death. Three German poems were published posthumously in 1823. One of Peterson's projects was fulfilled in his lifetime, the German version of Kristfrid Ganander's Mythologia Fennica, a dictionary of Finnish mythological words and names (the Swedish language original was published in 1789) Peterson's translation of Ganander's dictionary found many readers in Estonia and abroad, becoming an important source of national ideology and inspiration for early Estonian literature. Its dominating influence extended through the first decades of the 20th century. By nature, Peterson imitated the lifestyle of the Greek cynics and dressed extravagantly, including elements of Estonian traditional clothing (a characteristic long black coat) in his dress. Being exceptionally talented in linguistic subjects, he quickly obtained knowledge of several languages, both ancient and modern, wrote philological treatises and made an attempt to compose a Swedish grammar. In modern days, Peterson's linguistic manuscripts, together with the original versions of his poems and diary, were published in 2001 in an Estonian-German bilingual edition, which included some new translations.Kristian Jaak Peterson at Estonian Literature information Center References Category:1801 births Category:1822 deaths Category:Writers from Riga Category:Riga State Gymnasium No.1 alumni Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:19th-century Estonian poets Category:Estonian male poets Category:19th-century male writers ","title":"Kristjan Jaak Peterson"},{"id":"13058148","text":"Hill 'n' Dale Farms is a thoroughbred race horse breeding farm with operations in Canada and the United States.

The dictionary superseded An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand of 1966, which had 900 biographies. The dictionary is managed by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage of the Government of New Zealand. An earlier work of the same name in two volumes, published in 1940 by Guy Scholefield with government assistance, is unrelated. Overview Work on the current version of the DNZB was started in 1983 under the editorship of W. H. Oliver. The first volume covered the period 1769‚Äì1869 and was published in 1990. The four subsequent volumes were all edited by Claudia Orange, and they were published in 1993 (1879‚Äì1900), 1996 (1901‚Äì1920), 1998 (1920‚Äì1940), and 2000 (1941‚Äì1960). These later volumes made a conscious effort to move away from the male and PƒÅkehƒÅ- dominated coverage of early works to a more representative view of New Zealand. Women who had done well in male-dominated fields (Sybil Audrey Marie Lupp, Amy Isabella Johnston, Mary Jane Innes, Alice Woodward Horsley, Nora Mary Crawford, etc.) were included, as were MƒÅori, a range of ordinary people (Joseph Zillwood, etc.) and criminals (Edward Raymond Horton, Jessie Finnie, etc.). Many of these people were included because detailed accounts of their lives were readily available, in archives, academic studies and official histories. Others were prolific diarists (Catherine Fulton, Sarah Louise Mathew, Alexander Whisker, James Cox, etc.). Helen Clark as Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage launched the online version of the DNZB on 19 February 2002. The online version was first promoted by Judith Tizard, a graduate in history from the University of Auckland, which was supported by Clark, who had also graduated in history from the same university, and endorsed by Michael Cullen, who had been a history lecturer at the University of Otago. The dictionary was integrated into Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand in December 2010. In 2017 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage announced a 'new phase' in the life of the DNZB, with the addition of an essay about Tupaia; this was followed in 2018 by 25 new essays to mark the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage in New Zealand. Subsequent rounds will illuminate the lives of significant and representative people from a cross-section of New Zealand society, with a focus on the decades after 1960. Representative entries  A number of entries were added to make the dictionary more representative of population covered, boosting the numbers of women, MƒÅori, and other minority groups. A number of these are not based on secondary sources, as encyclopaedias traditionally are, but instead on primary sources, because no secondary sources exist for these individuals.  Margaret Fraser  Fraser (later Johnston; 11 December 1866 ‚Äì 31 August 1951) was a New Zealand domestic servant and letter-writer. Born in Scotland, she emigrated alongside a brother in 1887, following two brothers who had gone to New Zealand earlier that decade. She was hoping for the remainder of her family to come out but when that did not happen, she started financially supporting them by sending money to Scotland. After many years as a domestic servant, she married in 1899 and had a farm with her husband, bringing up four children. They retired to Rotorua and after her husband's death, she lived with her daughter and grandchildren for another decade.  Jessie Finnie  Finnie (c.1822-?) was a prostitute. She was born in Scotland in circa 1822. Nielsine Paget Nielsine Paget (21 July 1858 ‚Äì 13 July 1932) was a homemaker and community worker in southern Hawke's Bay. Barbara Weldon  Weldon (1829-1882) was a prostitute and character. She was born in County Limerick, Ireland in about 1829.

He served as the Law Minister of India holding office at the Ministry of Law and Justice from 1977 to 1979 in the Morarji Desai Ministry. He is a senior advocate of the Supreme Court of India. He, along with his son Prashant Bhushan, was featured at 74th position in a list of the most powerful Indians published by The Indian Express in 2009. Political career Bhushan was an active member of the Congress (O) party and later the Janata Party. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha from 14 July 1977 to 2 April 1980 and held office of Union Law Minister in the Morarji Desai ministry from 1977 to 1979. As the Law minister, he introduced Forty- fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India, which repealed many provisions of Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India passed by the Indira Gandhi ministry. He joined the Bhartiya Janata Party in 1980. In 1986, he resigned from BJP after the party acted against his advice over an election petition. He became a founding member of the Aam Aadmi Party after its formal launch on 26 November 2012. Prominent cases and clients * Bhushan represented Raj Narain in a case against Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha judged Indira Gandhi guilty and declared her election to the Lok Sabha void. The decision resulted in widespread political protests and ultimately resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency in India. * In 1994, he appeared for two of the defendants accused of participating in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case. * In 2002, he appeared as a counsel for Arundhati Roy in a contempt case against her in the Supreme Court of India. * Bhushan represented Shaukat Hussain in 2008 for an appeal against his 10-year conviction for his role in the 2001 Indian Parliament attack. * Bhushan appeared as senior counsel for Transparency International in the Provident Fund scandal case of Ghaziabad, which allegedly involved several judges of the Indian judiciary. The bench abandoned the hearing after deeming his remarks as contemptuous and termed his behavior as that of a street urchin. * Shanti Bhushan was the counsel for the former Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda in a petition related to allocation of land for Bangalore - Mysore Infrastructure Corridor. * He has represented Rajendra Singh Lodha regarding the assets of Birla Corporation. * He represented V.S. Achuthanandan in the Supreme Court in the Idamalayar Dam corruption case against UDF leader R.Balakrishna Pillai and others. The bench awarded rigorous imprisonment for one year with fine of Rs. 10,000/- each to the accused persons. Activism In the late 1980s Shanti Bhushan was one of the founders of the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, a Non-governmental organization that conducts litigation on matters of public interest. The first president was Justice V. M. Tarkunde, who was also the founder of the People's Union for Civil Liberties. Other founder members were senior advocates including Fali Sam Nariman, Anil Divan, Rajinder Sachar and Colin Gonsalves. Shanti Bhushan, along with his son Prashant Bhushan has been involved in pressing for accountability in the Indian Judiciary by setting up Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reform (CJAR). The campaign has been responsible for action against the judicial misconduct of Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal and for the declaration of assets by the judges. The campaign had also protested against the actions and appointments of Justice S. Ashok Kumar, Madan Mohan Punchhi, Soumitra Sen and Ashwini Kumar Mata. In December 2009 the Committee on Judicial Accountability stated that it considered that recommendations for judicial appointments should only be made after a public debate, including review by members of the bar of the affected high courts. This statement was made in relation to controversy about the appointments of justices C. K. Prasad and P. D. Dinakaran. The statement was signed by Ram Jethmalani, Shanti Bhushan, Fali Sam Nariman, Anil B. Divan, Kamini Jaiswal and Prashant Bhushan. The father-son duo are currently facing charges for contempt of court in Supreme Court of India for their statement about corruption in higher judiciary - specifically, about the corruption of former Chief Justices of the Supreme Court.

Biography He was the son of Henry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Dorothea of Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Frederick I of Brandenburg. Duke Henry IV had re-united the Mecklenburg lands under his rule through his inheritance of the former Lordships of Werle and Stargard in 1436 and 1471, respectively. Near the end of his life, Henry IV devoted more and more time to hedonistic luxury, while Magnus and his brothers Albert and John took over the most active share in the business of government. John died in 1474 leaving a grieving widow, Sophie of Pomerania-Stettin, daughter of Eric II of Pomerania, whom Magnus married himself on 29 May 1478. After Henry died in 1477, Magnus ruled the Duchy jointly with Albert. After Albert died in 1483, Magnus ruled alone, as his younger brother Balthasar did not care at all about governing. Magnus reigned until his death in 1503, when he was succeeded by his sons Henry V, Eric II and Albert VII, who at first ruled jointly until they split their lands into the duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow in 1520. The duchy's debt increased excessively due to the lavish court life of Henry IV. Magnus sought to reduce that debt. He curtailed his own ducal household in every way, and pawned goods and regalia. He tried to restore the shattered finances through the introduction of extraordinary (from Lower Saxon Beden: goods to be delivered to the manor by the serfs). This caused tensions with the Hanseatic cities of Rostock and Wismar that were trying to achieve a more independent position. In 1487 a rebellion broke out in Rostock that is known as the \\"Rostock Cathedral Feud\\" (). The trigger was the establishment of a collegiate church (commonly known as Dom) at the Church of St. James (). With this action, Magnus II wanted to secure the financing of the university and his position of power within the city. On 12 January 1487, the day the church was to be consecrated, Provost Thomas Rode was murdered in the street. Dignitataries present for the consecration had to flee the city. Magnus feared for his own life when his entourage was attacked. His life was saved by a bodyguard who threw himself on top of Magnus in the thick of the melee. The rebellion lasted until 1491. In the end, rebel leader Hans Runge and three other insurgents were executed and the city had to recognize the cathedral chapter, pay a substantial fine and confirm all of the Duke's privileges. The excommunication and interdict under which Magnus and Balthasar had been placed by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III and Pope Innocent VIII were then rescinded. Besides these feuds in his own country, Magnus also had disputes with neighbouring princes and with his vassals, as was usual in those days, for example over inheritances, fiefs and border disputes. Magnus would participate in battles or mediate between the contending parties. Certain projects intended to benefit the economic position of his territories, such as the proposed canal connecting the Baltic Sea with the Elbe and North Sea via Lake Schwerin and the improvement of the quality of the Mecklenburg coinage had to be postponed indefinitely due to a lack of funding. In 1492, 27 Jews in Sternberg were condemned to death after being accused of desecrating bleeding communion wafers. Magnus confirmed the verdict, and the Jews were executed at the stake. In his domestic life he had the pleasure to see two of his daughters marry respected German princes. His daughter Anna became the matriarch of the House of Hesse and Sophie assumed the same status for the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin. After Magnus' death, his youngest daughter Catherine achieved fame in her own right as the mother of the famous Duke Maurice of Saxony. Magnus died on 20 November 1503 in Wismar and was later buried in Doberan Abbey.  Offspring  Magnus II was married to Sophie of Pomerania-Stettin. With her he had the following children: * Henry V, the Peaceable, (1479‚Äì1552), Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; married three times. Firstly, on 12 December 1505, he married Ursula of Brandenburg, with whom he had issue. He married secondly, on 12 June 1513, Helen of the Palatinate, with whom he also had issue. Finally, he married Ursula of Saxe-Lauenburg, with whom he had no issue. * Dorothea of Mecklenburg (21 October 1480 ‚Äì 1 September 1537 in Ribnitz), Abbess in the Ribnitz monastery from 24 February 1498. * Sophie, (18 December 1481 ‚Äì 12 July 1503 in Torgau); married, on 1 March 1500, John the Steadfast of Saxony and had issue. * Eric II, (1483‚Äì1508), Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin * Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, (1485‚Äì1525), Landgravine of Hesse; married firstly, on 20 October 1500, William II, Landgrave of Hesse, and had issue.

The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 25, U.S. Route 42 and U.S. Route 127 in Lakeside Park. On its way to KY 536 it goes through many towns. These towns include Edgewood, Erlanger, and Florence. The southernmost segment of the route is named Bristow Road, a moniker carried by KY 536 east of KY 1303. At Richardson Road in Independence, KY 1303 becomes Turkeyfoot Road, a name the route retains to its northern terminus. Route description KY 1303 begins at an intersection with KY 536 in Independence, heading north on two-lane undivided Bristow Road. The road passes farmland before heading through suburban residential neighborhoods. The route widens into a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and intersects Richardson Road, at which point the name changes to Turkeyfoot Road. KY 1303 intersects KY 1829 and forms a concurrency with that route. After KY 1829 splits to the west, the road passes through more suburban neighborhoods with some woods, heading into Erlanger. The route intersects the southern terminus of KY 236 and continues to the northeast, entering Crestview Hills.

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.80\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXX Reserve Corps.In German military nomenclature, \\"40\\" was rendered as \\"XXXX\\" in Roman numerals rather than the more conventional \\"XL\\". The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was mixed in recruitment. The 264th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from Thuringia, and was described as a Saxe-Altenburg regiment. The 265th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The 266th was also formed in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, but reportedly included recruits from Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Pomerania and other areas. The 34th Reserve Infantry Regiment, which replaced the 265th in 1915, was from West Prussia. Combat chronicle The 80th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. In 1915, it fought in the siege of Kovno and the battles on the Neman River and at Vilnius. From October 1915 to December 1916, the division was engaged in positional warfare, and fought in battles along Lake Naraƒç, after which it was transferred to the Western Front. It was in reserve and then engaged in positional warfare in Flanders and the Artois until April 1917, when it fought in the Battle of Arras. Later in 1917, it fought in the Battle of Passchendaele and resisted the French offensive at Verdun. The division participated in the German 1918 Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also called the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It later resisted various Allied counteroffensives, including the Oise-Aisne Offensive and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 541-543. Order of battle on formation The 80th Reserve Division, like the other divisions of its wave and unlike earlier German divisions, was organized from the outset as a triangular division. The order of battle of the division on December 29, 1914, was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935). *80.Reserve-Infanterie-Brigade **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 264 **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 265 **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 266 **Reserve-Radfahrer-Kompanie Nr. 80 *Reserve-Kavallerie-Abteilung Nr. 80 *80.Reserve-Feldartillerie-Brigade **Reserve-Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 65 **Reserve-Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 66 *Reserve-Pionier-Kompanie Nr. 82 *Reserve-Pionier-Kompanie Nr. 83 Order of battle on March 29, 1918 The most significant wartime structural change in the divisions of this wave was the reduction from two field artillery regiments to one. Over the course of the war, other changes took place, including the formation of artillery and signals commands and the enlargement of combat engineer support to a full pioneer battalion.

Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Predecessors of Shakespeare: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1973; pp. 78-9, 84. The play was never printed in its own historical era and survived in a single, untitled, defective manuscript until it was named and published in 1936.W. L. Renwick and W. W. Greg, eds., John of Bordeaux, or The Second Part of Friar Bacon, Oxford, Malone Society, 1936. It is usually dated to the 1590-94 period, shortly after the success of Greene's original Friar Bacon. Manuscript The sole extant original text of John of Bordeaux is MS. 507 in the Duke of Northumberland's Library at Alnwick Castle. It gives the appearance of being a shortened version, cut down for acting; it is annotated by the hands of two prompters, one of whom also annotated the surviving MS. of Edmund Ironside.Grace Ioppolo, Dramatists and Their Manuscripts in the Age of Shakespeare, Jonson, Middleton and Heywood, London, Routledge, 2006; pp. 120-1. The MS. text, with its \\"two missing scenes,\\" \\"confused nomenclature...and seemingly abbreviated romance plot,\\" presents a range of problems to modern editors.Laurie E. Maguire, \\"(Mis)diagnosing Memorial Reconstruction in John of Bordeaux,\\" in: John Pitcher, ed., Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England, Lewisburg, PA, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1999; pp. 114-28. Its difficulties lured one scholar into the contradiction of arguing that John of Bordeaux was a \\"bad quarto\\" -- that never got printed.Harry R. Hoppe, \\"John of Bordeaux: A Bad Quarto that Never Reached Print,\\" in: Charles T. Prouty, ed. Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild: University of Missouri Studies 21 (1946), pp. 119-32. Among the notes added to the MS. by the prompters is the name of John Holland, an actor who was with Lord Strange's Men in the early 1590s. That company performed a Friar Bacon play on 19 February 1592. Most scholars believe that this was Greene's original Friar Bacon; yet some researchers have pointed out that since Greene's play was the property of Queen Elizabeth's Men (in 1594), it might make sense to suppose that Strange's company was acting the \\"second part of Friar Bacon,\\" John of Bordeaux. Authorship The MS. is anonymous, and critics have proposed various solutions to the authorship question. Greene himself has been a favorite candidate; at the extreme, the play has been described as \\"definitely of Greene's authorship\\"Carl Edmund Rollyson and Frank Northen Magill, Critical Survey of Drama, Pasadena, CA, Salem Press, 2003; Vol. 3, p. 1439. -- though most commentators have not gone so far. It is noteworthy that three of the play's characters have names that derive from the Rosalynde (1590) of Thomas Lodge; Lodge collaborated with Greene on the play A Looking Glass for London (c. 1590). If Greene authored the play, it must have been written, or at least begun, before his 1592 death. The MS. \\"contains one speech in the hand of Henry Chettle, obvious written to supply a lacuna....\\"Maguire, p. 114. Plot The plot of John of Bordeaux depends heavily on that of the original Friar Bacon. The setting shifts to Germany from England, where Bacon is visiting the Emperor's court. Ferdinand, the son of Emperor Frederick II, fulfills the role of Prince Edward in the earlier play: Ferdinand lusts after a woman named Rossalin, just as Edward pursues Margaret. Rossalin, unlike Margaret, is married, to John of Bordeaux, the commander of the Emperor's armies in his war against the Turks. Ferdinand's pursuit of Rossalin is much harsher and more ruthless than that of Edward's of Margaret: Rossalin is disgraced, deprived of her home, reduced to beggary, imprisoned, and even threatened with death. Vandermast, the villainous magician from FBFB, returns in the sequel for a series of contests of magic with Bacon -- which Bacon consistently wins. Though the manuscript text is defective toward the end of the story, it is clear that Bacon brings about a happy ending, with the restoration of John and Rossalin to their prior good fortune and the exposure and repentance of Ferdinand. Bacon's English servant Perce constitutes the center of the play's comic relief in the subplot, as Bacon's servant Miles does in the original play. Among his other stunts, Perce gets German scholars to trade their copies of the works of Plato and Aristotle for a couple of bottles of wine. The story in John of Bordeaux bears some resemblance to that in the anonymous A Knack to Know an Honest Man (1594), which was a sequel to the earlier A Knack to Know a Knave (1592). Greene, among others, has been proposed as the author of A Knack to Know a Knave.Logan and Smith, pp. 78, 115, 280-7.

He has been part of the revival of the ethical doctrine known as virtue ethics, an Aristotelian doctrine which has received renewed interest in the past few decades. Oakley is particularly well known for his work on professional ethics and also the so-called 'problem' of friendship. The problem of friendship looks at how a strict application of impartialist ethical doctrines, such as utilitarianism and Kantianism, conflicts with our notions of friendship or 'true friendship'. In 1995, he published, with Dean Cocking, the now widely cited article \\"Indirect Consequentialism, Friendship, and the Problem of Alienation\\" in the journal Ethics.  Education  Oakley was educated at Sydney Road Community School, Brunswick, and studied his Bachelor of Arts at Swinburne University of Technology, graduating in 1981. He completed his PhD in Philosophy at La Trobe University in 1988. He teaches in the Master of Bioethics program run by Monash University Centre for Human Bioethics.  Work and awards  Oakley joined the Centre for Human Bioethics at Monash University (established by colleague Peter Singer) in 1990 and served as its Director for 13 years, from 1999 to 2012.

The flag is recognizable by the reverse colors normally seen on American flags: red and blue stripes in the field with eight-pointed blue stars on an elongated white canton. The unique colors and dimensions are sometimes described as showing a lack of uniformity in a young nation at war, with a poor infrastructure and bad communication. However, it was common practice during the Revolution for military units to carry flags that featured common American symbols (such as stripes and stars), but to make them uniquely identifiable for use as a company or regimental flag.Mastai, pg 39. As such, this flag was probably never intended for use as a national flag. The original flag has been preserved since 1914 in the collection of the North Carolina Museum of History in Raleigh, North Carolina. It measures 42 inches high and 100 inches on the fly. The canton is 35 inches high and 73 inches long. The stars are 8 inches in diameter and have eight points.National Park Service It is considered the oldest surviving example of an American flag with eight-pointed stars.Cooper, 27 History The flag was presented to the Grand Masonic Lodge of North Carolina in 1909 by Micajah Bullock's son, Edward, who was 81 years old at the time. While there is no historic documentation of the flag being used in the battle and studies of the flag suggest that it may have had 15 stars and 15 stripes at one timeCooper, 27. Mr. Cooper further suggests by providing an illustration of what the completed 15-star flag might have looked like.\\\\- either originally made or perhaps added on when U.S. flags had 15 stripes. The use of cotton cloth as the primary fabric is evidence of post-1790 construction. These factors cause some to question the validity of the Bullock story. However, Al Hoilman, curator of Political and Socio-Economic History at the museum, has studied the reports on the controversy and believes the flag could have been flown at the battle. ‚ÄúIt (story of the flag) smacks of truth to me,‚Äù he says. The Micajah Bullock chapter of North Carolina's DAR has collected extensive writings and records which lead to conclude based on the age of the fabric and no real evidence that any other stars were ever on the flag confirm the flag is real. While it may be an item of controversy, the family's documents record Micajah returning home weary from battle carrying the flag. Upon his passing, his son Edward was entrusted with its care. When copies of this design are sold or flown today, it is generally accepted as symbolic of the American Revolution and, specifically, the battle itself.http://www.ncdar.org/MicajahBullockChapter_files/html/guildfordflag.html References *Cooper, Grace Rogers Thirteen Star Flags 1973.

Horse pulling is a draft horse competition where horses in harness, usually one or two animals, pull a stone-boat or weighted sled and the winner is the team or animal that can pull the most weight for a short distance. There are different weight classes and strict rules to avoid animal cruelty. The Belgian horse is the breed most frequently seen, but other draft breeds are also used. There are also competitions for ponies, where they pull significant weight relative to their size, but usually for shorter distances than full-sized horses. Related sports are tractor pulling and Canine Weight pulling. However, horses pull less weight than tractors, but much more than dogs. History Horse pulling in Australia The sport of horse pulling originated when horses were still used for daily farm work. Farmers would challenge one another to see whose horse or team could pull the most weight. Since then, horse pulling has evolved into an organized sport with teams of equine athletes.Horsepull.com web site. Accessed October 18, 2010 Horses that are used for horse pulling are generally not used for work on the farm. Instead, they are worked regularly to keep their muscles and tendons strong and limber to prevent them from being hurt during competitions. History of the Dynamometer The dynamometer was first thought of after the end of World War 1, when farmers were using draft horses as the main power when tending their farms. Professor E. V. Collins, of Iowa State College (now Iowa State University), worked between the years of 1923-1926 to find a way to test the efficiency of plowing horses. He built several machines that were designed to test the pulling power of horses in different soil conditions.Eastern Draft Horse Association web site. Accessed October 18, 2010 One machine that was created was called the Dynamometer. This machine was specially created to test the maximum pulling power of teams of horses. Arrangements were made for horse pulling competitions to be held at fairs and horse shows. The dynamometer has changeable weights that are set on a vertical track. When a teams of horses were hooked to the machine, they would pull and the weights would move according to the strength of the team. There are several types of dynamometers including the Hensley-Humbert, Lance, Midwest, New York, Reed, Smith, and Tostenson. Competitions An obstacle course competition A starting load of 1500 pounds is set into the dynamometer, a weight that most teams are expected to be able to pull. Each team entered in the competition is hitched to the machine and they would pull it for a short distance. If the team can not pull the weight, they are removed from the competition and those that successfully pulled the weight continue on to the next round. The competition continues on in this way until only one team of horses remains. Rules and Regulations Rules and regulations are in place to protect the safety of the horses during competitions. The Eastern Draft Horse Association, being the largest horse pulling organization in the United States, works to ensure safety during competitions by enforcing rules and regulations. Each competition has its own rules in addition to the Eastern Draft Horse Associations rules.

Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXXI Reserve Corps.In German military nomenclature, \\"40\\" was rendered as \\"XXXX\\" in Roman numerals rather than the more conventional \\"XL\\". The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was recruited in various Prussian provinces: Brandenburg, Pomerania, and West Prussia. Combat chronicle The 81st Reserve Division initially fought on the Western Front, seeing its first action in the trenches west of the Somme. It was transferred to the Eastern Front in April 1915, and fought in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, crossing the San River and fighting around Przemy≈õl, and then fighting in the 1915 Battle of Lemberg. It continued fighting across the border between Austro-Hungarian Galicia and Russian Poland, fighting in a series of battles leading to the taking of Brest-Litovsk in August and Pinsk in September, and then settled into positional warfare in the Pripyat Marshes. It remained there until December 1917, when, after the armistice on the Eastern Front, it was sent back to the Western Front. It fought in the trenches and saw action in the Battle of Armenti√®res in April 1918, part of the Battle of the Lys, also known as the Lys Offensive or the Fourth Battle of Ypres. The division continued fighting on various parts of the Western Front until the end of the war.

From May to October, the ranch features outdoor chuckwagon suppers typical of those served on cattle drives, and western style living history areas. After burning in the Waldo Canyon Fire in 2012, the owners are rebuilding the Ranch and reopening the Chuckwagon Supper for the 2020 season, with its first dinner and show on May 21, 2020.  Flying W Ranch History  Russ and Marian Wolfe started the Flying W Chuckwagon in 1953. During the summer, people would come out from town to ride horses over the extensive ranch lands with Russ Wolfe ramrodding the outings. Some evenings, the group would be small enough for Marian to invite the riders to share in a \\"potluck.\\" Russ and Marian decided to make the affair a regular event - a scenic horseback ride followed by a home-cooked meal under the stars around an open camp fire. In 1953, with 11 paying guests, at $3.00 each, their Chuckwagon dream was born. Working blacksmith at Flying W Indian dance show at the Flying W Over time, brick by brick, Russ and Marian built the unique and diverse Western Village. Eventually consisting of 29 structures, including the Church, Jail, School House, Taos Pueblo, Printing Press, Kiva, Library, Drug Store, Homestead, Ute Theater, Train Depot, and more. All of these structures were built or transferred to the ranch. Navajo rug weavers, rodeos, silversmiths, ranch animals, Dutch-oven biscuits , and other forms of old west demonstrations made the venue peerless. Until the Waldo Canyon Fire in 2012, beginning the first weekend in October, meals and entertainment moved indoors to the Winter Steakhouse, which was originally the Ute Theatre in Colorado Springs. The building was dismantled after it closed in 1968 and moved to a new location at the Flying W where it was rebuilt as a steakhouse. Shows were performed in the Winter Steakhouse from October through the third weekend in December, and again from early March through mid May. The Picketwire Bar, named for the Purgatoire River was built in the 1880s and moved to the ranch in 1969. A typical evening at the Flying W starts with guests arriving at 5:00pm, with activities around the ranch until supper. Activities include Navajo Rug Weavers, horseshoeing, dutch oven demonstrations, a narrow-gauge railroad, gunfights, and ranch animals. Supper consists of a three-course meal for all guests, the main choices being smoked brisket or smoked turkey. Since reopening in 2020, the Flying W also offers vegetarian and gluten-free meals. Each night, supper is followed by the cowboy singing of the Flying W Wranglers. The Flying W Chuckwagon (with the Flying W Wranglers) is part of the Chuckwagon Association of the West, which consists of five other member chuckwagons located in Wyoming, South Dakota, New Mexico, Missouri, and Colorado, all of which featured traditional chuck-wagon cooking, followed by professional-quality after-supper entertainment of comedy and western songs. The Flying W Ranch was destroyed by the Waldo Canyon fire on June 26, 2012. The owners have committed to rebuilding it and portions the ranch reopened July 10, 2020. The General Manager at the time, Jay Chladek, had his wedding and reception June 22, 2012, and left for his honeymoon the morning of the evacuation. He was still on his honeymoon when the Flying W Ranch was destroyed by the fire. He worked for the Flying W Ranch for almost 27 years. The final event at the location was a wedding in the Old Chapel on Saturday June 23, 2012, the day the fire started. The wedding party and guests were evacuated by police immediately following the service as staff and employees rushed to save as many artifacts as possible.http://www.flyingw.com/ Flying W Ranch home page On June 29, 2019 ground was broken on a new 8000 square foot event facility that will seat 900.

The Flying W Wranglers have been a part of the ranch's traditional entertainment since 1953, making them the world's second oldest western singing group in the world. Made up of working cowboys on the Flying W Ranch, the members have participated in branding in the fall, as well as all other duties of farm-and-ranch life. Their three-part-harmonies of time-honored tunes of the open range, high quality instrumentation, and clean bunkhouse humor have delighted over seven million people from around the world. In addition to performing at the Ranch, they performed in USO tours in Vietnam during the war, at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, in London, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and at Carnegie Hall in New York City. The Flying W Wranglers have been staged in local and national television commercials, have performed with several world-class symphonies, have sung in major sporting events, and have won a wide variety of musical awards. Given the deep legacy, for the re-birth of the Ranch post Waldo Canyon fire, over 300 musicians and entertainers were auditioned. Beginning in 2020, the first female Flying W Wrangler in the history of the ranch became part of the show.  Flying W Foundation  Following the destruction of the Flying W Ranch and 346 homes within the neighboring community of Mountain Shadows, the Flying W Ranch Foundation was formed. The Flying W Ranch Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Their purpose and mission is to restore and mitigate the Waldo Canyon burn area, preserve the history of the Old West, and be a blessing to the community. The Foundation does work such as: * Installing log erosion control structures to stabilize hill slopes and drainages prone to flood events * Planting seed and spreading mulch over acres of burned terrain * Planting saplings to jumpstart the restoration of the forest * Removing noxious weeds * Mastication of burned tree stands With the help of other non-profit organizations, government agencies and countless volunteers, the Flying W Ranch Foundation is working to bring natural beauty back to the hill slopes of Colorado Springs, educating members of our community, as well as insuring safe drinking water.

As of the 2010 census, there were an estimated 92,638 Kenyan-born persons living in the United States. Most Kenyan Americans are concentrated in California, Texas, Maryland, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, and the greater Washington, D.C. area. History Restrictions against immigration from Asia and Africa led to little voluntary immigration from Kenya until the latter half of the 20th century. Kenyan emigration to the United States then noted a large increase, nearly doubling from the decades before. This increase was caused by several factors; political instability and a downturn in the economy in the 1980s in Kenya coupled with a high rate of unemployment (over 35 percent) led to a greater desire to immigrate. Some immigrants were also attracted to technology-oriented careers in the United States that boomed in availability in the 1990s and early 2000s. Demography Kenyan Americans come from ethnic groups such as the Kikuyu, Kisii, Luhya, Kamba, Kalenjin, Meru or Luo people. The largest populations of Kenyans in the United States are found in Southern California, Massachusetts, and the greater Washington, D.C. area. Many Kenyans are also established in Georgia and North Carolina, states with important health care centers. According to the 2010 census, approximately one-third of persons born in Kenya who are living in the US have become naturalized citizens While many Kenyan Americans express the desire to eventually return to Kenya, the instability of Kenya's economy deters them. Those who remain in the US maintain contact with their Kenyan relatives and make frequent trips to Kenya. Education and socioeconomics African immigrants are among the most educated groups in the United States. Like their recent immigrant counterparts Kenyan Americans give a high value to education. This has allowed them to find skilled positions. Even during their initial adjustment period, Kenyan Americans usually do not require assistance like other immigrants, and they tend to have an overall high employment rate. Also, most Kenyans are already fluent in English, giving them an even greater advantage over other immigrant groups. Most Kenyans gravitate toward technology fields. Many also enter health care professions, especially nursing. Many also become doctors, lawyers, college professors, and business owners and managers. Organizations Like other immigrant groups living in the US, Kenyan Americans have created many organizations. These include the Kenya Diaspora Advisory Council, the Kenya American Association, the Kenyan-Cincinnati Association (\\"kcaweb\\", whose goal is to facilitate Kenyan integration in social and cultural scopes in the tri-state area and promoting awareness of the culture of Kenya in the United States), the Minnesota Kenyan International Development Association (\\"MKIDA\\", formed in 2003, to improve education and the economy of the Kenyan Americans) and KACA (Kenyan Americans Community Association). Kenyan-American Chamber of Commerce (KACC, Inc.) was formed in 1999. This is a private investment company to increase development of Kenyan communities with investments in technology, educational, and other sectors. The organization also drives trade and culture between Kenya and the United States. The American Kenyan Educational Corporation focuses on funding secondary school students and building schools in Kenya.

In May 1910 Guy Bowman and Tom Mann, two dissident members of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) travelled to France visiting members of the syndicalist General Confederation of Labour. Mann returned convinced of their doctrine. He started the monthly newspaper The Industrial Syndicalist in July. He went on to establish contacts with leading syndicalists in the United Kingdom like Peter Larkin and James Larkin, and other dissidents in the Independent Labour Party, the SDF, and the Clarion movement. In November 1910 the ISEL was founded at two-day conference in Manchester, allegedly attended by 200 delegates representing 60,000 workers. The ISEL became the first British fully syndicalist organisation, and the largest ever. It was not a trade union, but rather sought to disseminate syndicalist ideas within the labour movement. The ISEL did not have a formal organisational structure or membership. It did not consider the conditions to be ripe to start a mass organisation, thus it consisted mainly of Mann and a few of his confidants. It gained the support of E. J. B. Allen, associated with the Industrialist League. It published a monthly newspaper The Syndicalist, which claimed a circulation of 20,000. The period from 1910 to 1914 was marked by labour unrest including the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike and the Dublin lock-out. Tom Mann was the head of the strike committee of the former, which did not allow any transportation in the city without its permission. The ISEL also had close contact to coal miners in South Wales. In November 1912, the ISEL held a two conferences with a claimed attendance of 235 delegates representing 100,000 workers. That winter, the organisation began setting up branches and drawing up a constitution. In September 1913, the ISEL hosted the First International Syndicalist Congress at Holborn Town Hall in London, where syndicalists from all over Europe and South America convened. The same year also saw the ISEL collapse. The period of unrest that had been significant for the development of British syndicalism was coming to an end. Bowman, an important theoretician in the group, turned to the Industrial Workers of the World, winning the ISEL to a dual unionist position. Those in the group opposed to this line left to form the Industrial Democracy League, and the ISEL dissolved soon after.

He played for the North Sydney Bears, Wests Tigers and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, as a or . Club career Seers played his junior football with Cudgen Hornets before becoming a student of St Gregory's College, Campbelltown for his senior years of high school. He was an Australian Secondary Schoolboys Representative in 1992. On the 29 August 1993, Seers made his first grade d√©but against South Sydney coming off the bench in a 36-16 victory at the Sydney Football Stadium. In 1994, Seers' talent kept experienced fullback Greg Barwick in reserve grade and, in 1994, forced the club's star signing, Manly-Warringah fullback Ivan Cleary, into the centres. He was named Norwich \\"Rising Star of the Year\\" that season. In the 1994 preliminary final against Canberra, Seers managed to chase down Canberra Fullback Brett Mullins who had made a break down the centre of the field and had looked certain to score a try. Norths went on to lose the game 22-9. In 1996, Seers played 18 games and scored 7 tries including a try in the 1996 preliminary final defeat against St. George. In 1997, Seers played in 25 games as Norths made it to the preliminary final before losing to eventual premiers Newcastle. During the match with Newcastle leading 12-4, Seers made a break down the right hand touchline and looked certain to score a try when Darren Albert raced across the field and tackled Seers just short of the line. Norths made the semis again in 1998, with Seers making a mid-season change to centre and Ben Ikin playing at fullback. He played in both finals matches which both ended in defeat against Parramatta and Canterbury- Bankstown. Seers played 133 games for Norths including the club's final ever game in first grade which was a 28-18 victory over North Queensland in Townsville in which Seers was sin binned. After a troubled period in which he was admitted into rehab for a drug problem, Seers signed with the Tigers for 2000. After initially being left out of the first Wests Tigers' teams, Seers had some success under coach Terry Lamb. Seers moved to the Super League club the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats for the 2003 season. He was released by the club in August the same year after breaking his hand a few months earlier. Seers signed a one-year contract with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 2004 season, but failed to play any first grade. In 2010, Seers joined Craig Field to play for the Cudgen Hornets in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League. Representative In 1995, Seers made his d√©but at fullback for Country Origin. Two years later he scored a try in the team's 17-4 victory over City. Seers was selected for four New South Wales State of Origin games. He was on the bench for the first and third games in 1995 and the second round in 1997. Seers was given a start on the wing in the third 1997 Origin game.

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.82\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXXI Reserve Corps.In German military nomenclature, \\"40\\" was rendered as \\"XXXX\\" in Roman numerals rather than the more conventional \\"XL\\". The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was recruited in various Prussian provinces, primarily Brandenburg and Silesia. Combat chronicle The 82nd Reserve Division initially fought on the Western Front, seeing its first action in the trenches west of the Somme. It was transferred to the Eastern Front in April 1915, and fought in the Gorlice- Tarn√≥w Offensive, crossing the San River and fighting around Przemy≈õl, and then fighting in the 1915 Battle of Lemberg. It continued fighting across the border between Austro-Hungarian Galicia and Russian Poland, fighting in a series of battles leading to the taking of Brest-Litovsk in August and Pinsk in September, and then settled into positional warfare in the Pripyat Marshes. It remained there until December 1917, when after the armistice on the Eastern Front, it was sent back to the Western Front. It fought in the trenches and against various Allied attacks until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 547-549. Order of battle on formation The 82nd Reserve Division, like the other divisions of its wave and unlike earlier German divisions, was organized from the outset as a triangular division.

The estate, an example of the American country house movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2003. Oldfields was built between 1909 and 1913 by architect Lewis Ketcham Davis for the family of Hugh McKennan Landon, who occupied the home from 1913 until 1932 when it was sold to Josiah K. Lilly Jr. and Lilly, the late Indianapolis businessman, collector, and philanthropist, renovated and expanded the estate throughout the 1930s and 1940s, updating interiors as well as adding a number of new buildings to the grounds. Now known as Lilly House, the 22-room mansion has undergone historic restoration and is now open to the public. The historic house is currently interpreted to reflect the 1930s era when the Lilly family occupied the residence. The rest of the Oldfields estate, which was given to the Art Association of Indianapolis by Lilly's children in 1967, now makes up a major portion of the Newfields campus. In addition to the home's significance as a representation of the American country house movement, Oldfields' gardens and grounds are a rare example of a preserved estate landscape designed by Percival Gallagher of the Olmsted Brothers firm. History Oldfields was established as part of the Town of Woodstock, a tract of land purchased and developed by Hugh McKennan Landon and Linnaes C. Boyd around 1910 as a suburban neighborhood north of Indianapolis. The area was adjacent to the 555 acre Crown Hill Cemetery and the White River, and included residential lots, a reservoir, and a country club. Landon reserved 26 acres, or about half of the land, for the construction of Oldfields, which was completed around 1913. In 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, Josiah K. Lilly Jr. purchased the estate. In spite of the economic times, Lilly undertook a number of renovation and expansion projects on the property, including an extension to the south for a new library, renovation of the stair hall and front entrance, and the addition of a vestibule that aligned the entrance with the all√©e at the front of the property. In the 1950s Lilly redecorated several rooms in keeping with the tastes of the time. Bookshelves were removed and walls repainted in order to make room for an expanding portrait collection. Additionally, muralist Douglas Riseborough was employed to update the stair hall and the loggia with murals depicting the surrounding grounds and gardens. While most of these renovations were changed in subsequent decades, the mural illustrating views of the all√©e can still be seen in the loggia. In 1967, following the deaths of Lilly and his wife, the Lilly children, Ruth Lilly and J.K. Lilly III, gave the estate to the Art Association of Indianapolis to serve as the new art museum. Called the \\"Lilly Pavilion of Decorative Arts\\", the house served as exhibit space at the time that the association changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1969. In the years that followed the exhibits focused more on decorative arts and less on the historic aspects of the home and garden. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, planning began to restore Oldfields to its former condition. In 2002 the historic home reopened to the public, and in 2003 it was designated as a national historic landmark. The property is considered a historic district and includes 10 buildings and 28 other contributing resources. Country house movement Oldfields is an exemplary representation of an estate constructed during the Country Place Era, or the American country house movement, which took place from approximately 1885 to 1939. The country house movement was a reaction to the expanding industrialization and urbanization of America following the Civil War. As industrialists and businessmen became more wealthy at the turn of the twentieth century, it became increasingly popular to invest in large, country estates located outside of cities. It was a way to return to a simpler life, far from the increasingly crowded, dirty, industrialized city. As more families began to own automobiles it became even more feasible to live in the country while remaining involved in city life. Country houses during this era were often palatial, with expansive estates and architecturally designed gardens. Many estates were self-sufficient farms as well. While the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina is considered to be the first and most grand example of the Country Place Era, estates as small as twenty acres could also be reflective of the movement. Oldfields is one such example. Structure Lilly House was designed by Landon's brother-in-law, Lewis Ketcham Davis, in the French Ch√¢teau style. The house is positioned on a bluff overlooking the White River, taking advantage of expansive views to the west. The house includes a service wing, pavilions on the east and west with access to balconies from the second floor, and a large terrace atop a garage and service area. While occupied by the Landon family, the main floor originally included a music room, library, sunroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, and porch. The second floor was made up of private suites, bedrooms, bathrooms, the servants suite, and a study. A third floor ballroom was also present in the Landon home and was used for storage during the Lilly's occupancy. At that time the estate also included a formal garden, greenhouse, tennis court, and several out buildings. Following the renovations of J.K. Lilly Jr., components of the main level included a great hall, game room, library, drawing room, loggia, dining room, kitchen, and servants quarters as well as an altered stair hall and entrance. Grounds and gardens Present day view from the lower portion of the ravine garden designed by Percival Gallagher. The first garden on the estate was included as part of the initial design by architect Lewis Ketcham Davis. This formal sunken garden was located to the south of the home and was connected by a series of pathways, flights of steps, and a limestone bridge. The focus of the garden was a circular fountain, surrounded by arbor trellises, two Hermes sculptures, and a shaded bench. The garden has been restored and remains true to its former design. The landscape remained largely unchanged until Percival Gallagher of the Olmsted Brothers Firm was hired in 1920 by Landon's second wife, Jessie. Gallagher's plans for the property balanced formal components, such as the extravagant all√©e, and more informal components such as the ravine garden. The ravine garden consists of a watercourse lined with an extensive pattern of rocks, flowers, shrubs, and trees, as well as a meandering path and bridge. The Grand All√©e, or vista, at the front of the property added an increased sense of formality to the estate, while also serving the more practical function of blocking unwanted sounds and views of Michigan Road. A circular fountain and sculpture of the Three Graces were installed at the end of the all√©e, positioned in front of a line of evergreens which block the road. Double rows of Dutch elms were planted along each side of the all√©e, framing the view of the house and drive. Behind the elm trees on both sides of the all√©e Gallagher designed border gardens with meandering paths, a multitude of flower beds, and additional sculptures. The border gardens were meant to entice visitors to explore the paths before emerging at the far end of the all√©e. When the Lillys purchased the property in 1933 the gardens and grounds were just beginning to mature. The family left the gardens largely unaltered other than the addition of several sculptures throughout. Lilly also constructed a number of new buildings on the grounds, expanding the greenhouse significantly. In 1939 Newfield was constructed as a residence for Joe Lilly and his family. In 1940 a recreation building was built in the south pasture that housed an indoor pool, game room, and exercise room. Outside of the recreation building was an outdoor pool, tennis court, and Four Seasons garden. An antique wellhead from Europe is located there. Today Today Oldfields makes up a major portion of Newfields, with Lilly House located adjacent to the main Indianapolis Museum of Art building and the Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park: 100 Acres. The house features eight furnished historic rooms on the main level including the stair hall, great hall, game room, library, drawing room, loggia, dining room, and kitchen, the majority of which reflect the 1930s period of the Lilly family's occupancy. Nearly 90 percent of the furnishings and objects are original to the house and were used by the Lilly family. The upper level of Lilly House features historical and interactive exhibits detailing the American Country Place era, Oldfields' development as a country estate, and Indianapolis in the early 20th century. The second level also includes a sampling of Lilly's collections of books, gold coins, military miniatures and nautical items. Oldfields' gardens and grounds are preserved and maintained by the museum and are interpreted to reflect the intentions of Percival Gallagher's design.

Career 2007 Miss Teen USA pageant Upton became Miss South Carolina Teen USA for 2007 in the November 2006 state pageant. She went on to place as third runner-up in the Miss Teen USA 2007 pageant. She gained international notoriety for her convoluted and nonsensical response to a question posed to her during the August 2007 national pageant. During the pageant, Upton responded to a question posed by host Aimee Teegarden: \\"Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map. Why do you think this is?\\" Upton responded: > I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, > some, uh, people out there in our nation don't have maps and, uh, I believe > that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, > everywhere like such as, and, I believe that they should, our education over > here in the U.S. should help the U.S., uh, or, uh, should help South Africa > and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to > build up our future. For our children. As a guest on NBC's The Today Show, Upton told Ann Curry and Matt Lauer that she was overwhelmed when asked the question and did not comprehend it correctly. The Today Show hosts gave Upton another opportunity to answer. She responded: > Well personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United States > is on our map.

Born Peter Halajian in Armenia, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1890 and worked in a rubber factory, opening a candy shop on February 1, 1895, in Naugatuck, Connecticut, and changing his surname to the English equivalent Paul. After selling chocolate bars to the U.S. Army for use by soldiers in World War I, who demanded them when they came home, he teamed with five other Armenian investors (including his brother-in-law Cal Kazanjian, Cal's cousin Artin Kazanjian, chemist George Shamlian, Jacob Chouljian and his cousin Jacob Hagopian) to form the Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company on Webster Street in New Haven in 1919 with $6,000. The company at first sold various brands of candies, including the Mounds bar, but following sugar and coconut shortages in World War II, they dropped most brands and concentrated on the Mounds bar, with the U.S. military purchasing as much as 80% of their output by 1944, packing 5 million candy bars monthly into combat rations. The Almond Joy bar was introduced in 1946. In 1978 Peter Paul merged with Cadbury-Schweppes.

History It was founded in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1919 by six Armenian immigrants led by Peter Paul Halajian, with a manufacturing plant in nearby Naugatuck, Connecticut.Peter Paul's Path to Sweet Success Connecticut Explored. The company's first product was the Konabar, consisting of chocolate-covered coconut, nuts, and fruit, which was fairly successful. In 1920, they purchased the rights to Knight's Knifty Knibbles, owned by Anita Grace Knight of Plainfield, New Jersey, and in 1921, introduced the renamed Mounds candy bar, which featured white sweetened coconut and dark chocolate. Despite constant efforts to automate production and cut costs, the Great Depression threatened the $200 million U.S. candy market, and in 1932, they took a risk, retooling and repackaging Mounds in cellophane rather than tin foil for better sales appeal, and doubling the product‚Äôs size, making it a twin bar for the same five-cent price. The gamble worked, and within 30 days, sales zoomed. In 1934, the company built a $60,000 addition to the Naugatuck plant and invested still more in new machinery to meet demand, using earnings to pay for expansion without incurring debt. In the same year, the company introduced a new product, the Dreams candy bar, named by students participating in a contest at Naugatuck High School. It consisted of diced almonds and coconut covered with dark chocolate, becoming the forerunner of the Almond Joy bar. In February 1935, after increasing wages by as much as 20%, the company‚Äôs stock split two for one, becoming a sensational story carried nationally by the Associated Press. Bucking the national trend, the company paid stockholders continuous quarterly dividends throughout the Depression. During World War II, despite sugar and coconut shortages, Mounds became a hit with the U.S. military, which purchased 80% of their production by 1944 (5 million bars/month) for use in rations. It also sold caramels and charcoal gum during the war because they used little sugar. The Almond Joy bar was introduced in 1948, using milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate, and adding a double-toasted almond on top, sold in a blue package to differentiate it from the Mounds' red package, becoming an immediate successALMOND JOY candy bar, The Hershey Company, Accessed January 15, 2009.

When analyzing a family's SES, the household income, earners' education, and occupation are examined, as well as combined income, whereas for an individual's SES only their own attributes are assessed. However, SES is more commonly used to depict an economic difference in society as a whole.National Center for Educational Statistics. 31 March 2008. http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/glossary/s.asp Socioeconomic status is typically broken into three levels (high, middle, and low) to describe the three places a family or an individual may fall into. When placing a family or individual into one of these categories, any or all of the three variables (income, education, and occupation) can be assessed. Additionally, low income and education have been shown to be strong predictors of a range of physical and mental health problems, including respiratory viruses, arthritis, coronary disease, and schizophrenia. These problems may be due to environmental conditions in their workplace, or, in the case of disabilities or mental illnesses, may be the entire cause of that person's social predicament to begin with.Goode, Erica (1 June 1999) \\"For Good Health, it Helps to be Rich and important\\" The New York TimesMarmot, Michael. 2004. The Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Affects Our Health and Longevity. New York: Owl Books.Werner, Shirli, Malaspina, Dolores, and Rabinowitz, Jonathan. Socioeconomic Status at Birth is Associated with Risk of Schizophrenia: Population-Based Multilevel Study. Schizophrenia Bulletin. 18 April 2007. Education in higher socioeconomic families is typically stressed as much more important, both within the household as well as the local community. In poorer areas, where food, shelter and safety are priority, education can take a backseat. Youth audiences are particularly at risk for many health and social problems in the United States, such as unwanted pregnancies, drug abuse, and obesity. Important factors Income Income refers to wages, salaries, profits, rents, and any flow of earnings received. Income can also come in the form of unemployment or worker's compensation, social security, pensions, interests or dividends, royalties, trusts, alimony, or other governmental, public, or family financial assistance. It can also come from monetary winnings, as from lotteries and other games or contests where money is awarded as a prize. Income can be looked at in two terms, relative and absolute. Absolute income, as theorized by economist John Maynard Keynes, is the relationship in which as income increases, so will consumption, but not at the same rate.Wisdom Supreme. 6 April 2008. http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/absolute-income-hypothesis.php Relative income dictates a person's or family's savings and consumption based on the family's income in relation to others. Income is a commonly used measure of SES because it is relatively easy to figure for most individuals. Income inequality is most commonly measured around the world by the Gini coefficient, where 0 corresponds to perfect equality and 1 means perfect inequality. Low-income families focus on meeting immediate needs and do not accumulate wealth that could be passed on to future generations, thus increasing inequality. Families with higher and expendable income can accumulate wealth and focus on meeting immediate needs while being able to consume and enjoy luxuries and weather crises.Boushey, Heather and Weller, Christian. (2005). Inequality Matters: The Growing Economic Divide in America and its Poisonous Consequences.. \\"What the Numbers Tell Us.\\" Pp 27-40. Demos. Education Education also plays a role in income. Median earnings increase with each level of education. As conveyed in the chart, the highest degrees, professional and doctoral degrees, make the highest weekly earnings while those without a high school diploma earn less. Higher levels of education are associated with better economic and psychological outcomes (i.e.: more income, more control, and greater social support and networking). Education plays a pivotal role in skillsets for acquiring jobs, as well as specific qualities that stratify people with higher SES from lower SES. Annette Lareau speaks on the idea of concerted cultivation, where middle class parents take an active role in their children's education and development by using controlled organized activities and fostering a sense of entitlement through encouraging discussion. Laureau argues that families with lower income do not participate in this movement, causing their children to have a sense of constraint. An interesting observation that studies have noted is that parents from lower SES households are more likely to give orders to their children in their interactions while parents with a higher SES are more likely to interact and play with their children. A division in education attainment is thus born out of these two differences in child-rearing. Research has shown how children who are born in lower SES households have weaker language skills compared to children raised in higher SES households. These language skills affect their abilities to learn and thus exacerbate the problem of education disparity between low and high SES neighbourhoods. Lower-income families can have children who do not succeed to the levels of the middle-income children, who can have a greater sense of entitlement, be more argumentative, or be better prepared for adult life.,Lareau, Annette. (2003). Unequal Childhoods: Race, Class, and Family Life. University of California Press Research shows that lower SES students have lower and slower academic achievement as compared with students of higher SES.Staff (2012) \\"Education & Socioeconomic Status\\" American Psychological Association When teachers make judgments about students based on their class and SES, they are taking the first step in preventing students from having an equal opportunity for academic achievement. Educators need to help overcome the stigma of poverty. A student of low SES and low self-esteem should not be reinforced by educators. Teachers need to view students as individuals and not as a member of an SES group. Teachers looking at students in this manner will help them to not be prejudiced towards students of certain SES groups.Gollnick, Donna M & Chinn,Philip. (2013) Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society Pearson. Raising the level of instruction can help to create equality in student achievement. Teachers relating the content taught to students' prior knowledge and relating it to real-world experiences can improve achievement. Educators also need to be open and discuss class and SES differences. It is important that all are educated, understand, and be able to speak openly about SES.Stanek (2012) Talking About Class Occupation Occupational prestige, as one component of SES, encompasses both income and educational attainment. The occupational status reflects the educational attainment required to obtain the job and income levels that vary with different jobs and within ranks of occupations. Additionally, it shows achievement in skills required for the job. Occupational status measures social position by describing job characteristics, decision-making ability and control, and psychological demands on the job. Occupations are ranked by the Census (among other organizations) and opinion polls from the general population are surveyed. Some of the most prestigious occupations are physicians and surgeons, lawyers, chemical and biomedical engineers, university professors, and communications analysts. These jobs, considered to be grouped in the high SES classification, provide more challenging work and greater control over working conditions but require more ability. The jobs with lower rankings include food preparation workers, counter attendants, bartenders and helpers, dishwashers, janitors, maids and housekeepers, vehicle cleaners, and parking lot attendants. The jobs that are less valued also offer significantly lower wages, and often are more laborious, very hazardous, and provide less autonomy.Scott, Janny and Leonhardt, David. \\"Class Matters: A Special Edition.\\" New York Times 14 May 2005. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/14/national/class/15MOBILITY-WEB.html Occupation is the most difficult factor to measure because so many exist, and there are so many competing scales. Many scales rank occupations based on the level of skill involved, from unskilled to skilled manual labour to professional, or use a combined measure using the education level needed and income involved. In sum, the majority of researchers agree that income, education and occupation together best represent SES, while some others feel that changes in family structure should also be considered.Milne, A., & Plourde, L. A. (2006). Factors of a Low-SES Household: What Aids Academic Achievement? SES affects students' cognitive abilities and academic success. Several researchers have found that SES affects students' abilities. Other variables Wealth Wealth, a set of economic reserves or assets, presents a source of security providing a measure of a household's ability to meet emergencies, absorb economic shocks, or provide the means to live comfortably. Wealth reflects intergenerational transitions as well as accumulation of income and savings.MacArthur Research Network on SES and Health. 31 March 2008. Income, age, marital status, family size, religion, occupation, and education are all predictors for wealth attainment. The wealth gap, like income inequality, is very large in the United States. There exists a racial wealth gap due in part to income disparities and differences in achievement resulting from institutional discrimination. According to Thomas Shapiro, differences in savings (due to different rates of incomes), inheritance factors, and discrimination in the housing market lead to the racial wealth gap. Shapiro claims that savings increase with increasing income, but African Americans cannot participate in this, because they make significantly less than Americans of European descent (whites). Additionally, rates of inheritance dramatically differ between African Americans and Americans of European descent. The amount a person inherits, either during a lifetime or after death, can create different starting points between two different individuals or families. These different starting points also factor into housing, education, and employment discrimination. A third reason Shapiro offers for the racial wealth gap are the various discriminations African Americans must face, like redlining and higher interest rates in the housing market. These types of discrimination feed into the other reasons why African Americans end up having different starting points and therefore fewer assets.Shapiro, Thomas. (2004). The Hidden Cost of Being African American: How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality. Oxford University Press. Effects Health Recently, there has been increasing interest from epidemiologists on the subject of economic inequality and its relation to the health of populations. Socioeconomic status has long been related to health, those higher in the social hierarchy typically enjoy better health than those below. Socioeconomic status is an important source of health inequity, as there is a very robust positive correlation between socioeconomic status and health, other than for male homosexuals. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy, but that there is a continual gradient, from the top to the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, relating status to health. Parents with a low socioeconomic status cannot afford many of the health care resources which is the reason that their children may have a more advanced illness because of the lack of treatment. This phenomenon is often called the \\"SES Gradient\\" or according to the World Health Organisation the \\"Social Gradient\\". Lower socioeconomic status has been linked to chronic stress, heart disease, ulcers, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, certain types of cancer, and premature aging. There is debate regarding the cause of the SES Gradient. Researchers see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the wealthy, but they find little correlation due to social status differences. Other researchers such as Richard G. Wilkinson, J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the Whitehall studies‚Äîa series of studies conducted on civil servants in London. The studies found that although all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship remained strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as exercise, smoking and drinking. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting type 2 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis‚Äîyet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. There is no significant relationship between SES and stress during pregnancy, while there is a significant relationship with a husband's occupational status. Also, there is no significant relationship between income and mother's education and the rate of pregnancy stress. Political participation Political scientists have established a consistent relationship between SES and political participation. Psychological Language development Home environment The environment of low SES children is characterized by less dialogue from parents, minimal amounts of book reading, and few instances of joint attention, the shared focus of the child and adult on the same object or event, when compared to the environment of high SES children. In contrast, infants from high SES families experience more child-directed speech. At 10 months, children of high SES hear on average 400 more words than their low SES peers. Language ability differs sharply as a function of SES, for example, the average vocabulary size of 3-year-old children from professional families was more than twice as large as for those on welfare. Children from lower income households had greater media access in their bedrooms but lower access to portable play equipment compared to higher income children. This eventually leads children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to be at a disadvantage when comparing them with their counterparts in terms of access to physical activities. Parental interactions In addition to the amount of language input from parents, SES heavily influences the type of parenting style a family chooses to practice. These different parenting styles shape the tone and purpose of verbal interactions between parent and child. For example, parents of high SES tend toward more authoritative or permissive parenting styles. These parents pose more open-ended questions to their children to encourage the latter's speech growth. In contrast, parents of low SES tend toward more authoritarian styles of address. Their conversations with their children contain more imperatives and yes/no questions that inhibits child responses and speech development. Parental differences in addressing children may be traced to the position of their respective groups within society. Working class individuals often hold low power, subordinate positions in the occupational world. This standing in the social hierarchy requires a personality and interaction style that is relational and capable of adjusting to circumstances. An authoritarian style of address prepares children for these types of roles, which require a more accommodating and compliant personality. Therefore, low SES parents see the family as more hierarchical, with the parents at the top of the power structure, which shapes verbal interaction. This power differential emulates the circumstances of the working class world, where individuals are ranked and discouraged from questioning authority. Conversely, high SES individuals occupy high power positions that call for greater expressivity. High SES parents encourage their children to question the world around them. In addition to asking their children more questions, these parents push their children to create questions of their own. In contrast with low SES parents, these individuals often view the power disparity between parent and child as detrimental to the family. Opting instead to treat children as equals, high SES conversations are characterized by a give and take between parent and child. These interactions help prepare these children for occupations that require greater expressivity. Disparities in language acquisition The linguistic environment of low and high SES children differs substantially, which affects many aspects of language and literacy development such as semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology.  Semantics  Semantics is the study of the meaning of words and phrases. Semantics covers vocabulary, which is affected by SES. Children of high SES have larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months due to more efficient processing of familiar words. By age 3, there are significant differences in the amount of dialogue and vocabulary growth between children of low and high SES. A lack of joint attention in children contributes to poor vocabulary growth when compared to their high SES peers. Joint attention and book reading are important factors that affect children's vocabulary growth. With joint attention, a child and adult can focus on the same object, allowing the child to map out words. For example, a child sees an animal running outside and the mom points to it and says, \\"Look, a dog.\\" The child will focus its attention to where its mother is pointing and map the word dog to the pointed animal. Joint attention thus facilitates word learning for children.  Syntax  Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to form sentences. SES affects the production of sentence structures. Although 22- to 44-month-old children's production of simple sentence structures does not vary by SES, low SES does contribute to difficulty with complex sentence structures. Complex sentences include sentences that have more than one verb phrase. An example of a complex sentence is, \\"I want you to sit there\\". The emergence of simple sentence structures is seen as a structure that is obligatory in everyday speech. Complex sentence structures are optional and can only be mastered if the environment fosters its development. This lag in the sentence formation abilities of low SES children may be caused by less frequent exposure to complex syntax through parental speech. Low SES parents ask fewer response-coaxing questions of their children which limits the opportunities of these children to practice more complex speech patterns. Instead, these parents give their children more direct orders, which has been found to negatively influence the acquisition of more difficult noun and verb phrases. In contrast, high SES households ask their children broad questions to cultivate speech development. Exposure to more questions positively contributes to children's vocabulary growth and complex noun phrase constructions.  Morphology  Children's grasp of morphology, the study of how words are formed, is affected by SES. Children of high SES have advantages in applying grammatical rules, such as the pluralization of nouns and adjectives compared to children of low SES. Pluralizing nouns consists of understanding that some nouns are regular and -s denotes more than one, but also understanding how to apply different rules to irregular nouns. Learning and understanding how to use plural rules is an important tool in conversation and writing. In order to communicate successfully that there is more than one dog running down the street, an -s must be added to dog. Research also finds that the gap in ability to pluralize nouns and adjectives does not diminish by age or schooling because low SES children's reaction times to pluralize nouns and adjectives do not decrease.  Phonology  Phonological awareness, the ability to recognize that words are made up different sound units, is also affected by SES. Children of low SES between the second and sixth grades are found to have low phonological awareness. The gap in phonological awareness increases by grade level. This gap is even more problematic if children of low SES are already born with low levels of phonological awareness and their environment does not foster its growth. Children who have high phonological awareness from an early age are not affected by SES.  Positive outcomes of low SES  Given the large amount of research on the setbacks children of low SES face, there is a push by child developmental researchers to steer research to a more positive direction regarding low SES. The goal is to highlight the strengths and assets low income families possess in raising children. For example, African American preschoolers of low SES exhibit strengths in oral narrative, or storytelling, that may promote later success in reading. These children have better narrative comprehension when compared to peers of higher SES. Since 2012, there has also been some research on the Shift-and-persist model, which attempts to account for the counterintuitive positive health outcomes that can occur in individuals who grow up in low SES families. Literacy development A gap in reading growth exists between low SES and high SES children, which widens as children move on to higher grades. Reading assessments that test reading growth include measures on basic reading skills (i.e., print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, word recognition), vocabulary (receptive vocabulary), and reading comprehension skills (i.e., listening comprehension, words in context). The reading growth gap is apparent between the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first-grade, the time when children rely more on the school for reading growth and less on their parents. Initially, high SES children begin as better readers than their low SES counterparts. As children get older, high SES children progress more rapidly in reading growth rates than low SES children. These early reading outcomes affect later academic success. The further children fall behind, the more difficult it is to catch up and the more likely they will continue to fall behind. By the time students enter high school in the United States, low SES children are considerably behind their high SES peers in reading growth. Home environment Home environment is one of the leading factors of a child's well being. Children living in a poor home with inadequate living conditions are more likely to be susceptible to illness and injuries. The disparities in experiences in the home environment between children of high and low SES affect reading outcomes. The home environment is considered the main contributor to SES reading outcomes. Children of low SES status are read to less often and have fewer books in the home than their high SES peers, which suggests an answer to why children of low SES status have lower initial reading scores than their high SES counterparts upon entering kindergarten. Low SES parents are also less involved in their children's schooling. The home environment makes the largest contribution to the prediction of initial kindergarten reading disparities. Characteristics of the home environment include home literacy environment and parental involvement in school. Home literacy environment is characterized by the frequency with which parents engage in joint book reading with the child, the frequency with which children read books outside of school, and the frequency with which household members visited the library with the child. Parental involvement in school is characterized by attending a parent‚Äìteacher conference, attending a parent‚Äìteacher association (PTA) meeting, attending an open house, volunteering, participating in fundraising, and attending a school event. Resources, experiences, and relationships associated with the family are most closely associated with reading gaps when students' reading levels are first assessed in kindergarten. The influence of family factors on initial reading level may be due to children experiencing little schooling before kindergarten‚Äîthey mainly have their families to rely on for their reading growth. Family SES is also associated with reading achievement growth during the summer. Students from high SES families continue to grow in their ability to read after kindergarten and students from low SES families fall behind in their reading growth at a comparable amount. Additionally, the summer setback disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic students because they are more likely than White students to come from low SES families. Also, low SES families typically lack the appropriate resources to continue reading growth when school is not in session. Neighborhood influence The neighborhood setting in which children grow up contributes to reading disparities between low and high SES children. These neighborhood qualities include but are not limited to garbage or litter in the street, individuals selling or using drugs in the street, burglary or robbery in the area, violent crime in the area, vacant homes in the area, and how safe it is to play in the neighborhood. Low SES children are more likely to grow up in such neighborhood conditions than their high SES peers. Community support for the school and poor physical conditions surrounding the school are also associated with children's reading. Neighborhood factors help explain the variation in reading scores in school entry, and especially as children move on to higher grades. As low SES children in poor neighborhood environments get older, they fall further behind their high SES peers in reading growth and thus have a more difficult time developing reading skills at grade level. In a study by M. Keels, it was determined that when low-income families are moved from poor neighborhoods to suburban neighborhoods, there are reductions in delinquency in children. When comparing different social statuses of families, the environment of a neighborhood turns out to be major factor in contributing to the growth of a child. School influence School characteristics, including characteristics of peers and teachers, contribute to reading disparities between low and high SES children. For instance, peers play a role in influencing early reading proficiency. In low SES schools, there are higher concentrations of less skilled, lower SES, and minority peers who have lower gains in reading. The number of children reading below grade and the presence of low-income peers were consistently associated with initial achievement and growth rates. Low SES peers tend to have limited skills and fewer economic resources than high SES children, which makes it difficult for children to grow in their reading ability. The most rapid growth of reading ability happens between the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. Teacher experience (number of years teaching at a particular school and the number of years teaching a particular grade level), teacher preparation to teach (based on the number of courses taken on early education, elementary education, and child development), the highest degree earned, and the number of courses taken on teaching reading all determine whether or not a reading teacher is qualified. Low SES students are more likely to have less qualified teachers, which is associated with their reading growth rates being significantly lower than the growth rates of their high SES counterparts. Influences on nonverbal behavior Michael Kraus and Dacher Keltner, in their study published in the December 2008 issue of Psychological Science, found that children of parents with a high SES tended to express more disengagement behaviors than their peers of low SES. In this context, disengagement behaviors included self-grooming, fidgeting with nearby objects, and doodling while being addressed. In contrast, engagement behaviors included head nods, eyebrow raises, laughter and gazes at one's partner. These cues indicated an interest in one's partner and the desire to deepen and enhance the relationship. Participants of low SES tended to express more engagement behaviors toward their conversational partners, while their high SES counterparts displayed more disengagement behaviors. Authors hypothesized that, as SES rises, the capacity to fulfill one's needs also increases. This may lead to greater feelings of independence, making individuals of high SES less inclined to gain rapport with conversational partners because they are less likely to need their assistance in the future.

It is their only album to feature bassist Nico Scheffler and was their first album not recorded in Sweden. Keeping consistent with their recent work (since As Blood Rains from the Sky...), the band's unique sound is created through an amalgamation of melodic guitar rhythmics built upon a foundation of very heavy, very familiar, highly brutal drumwork and vocals. Like other melodic death metal bands, such as Grave, Arch Enemy and (early) Entombed, Fleshcrawl's guitar work for this album is laden with Swedish death metal- style distortion, especially in the riffing, which remains comparable to their earlier releases in that it utilizes mid-to-high range tones and moderate-to- rapid tempos, accented by occasional, moderately-technical guitar solos, which tend to be somewhat longer and more rhythmic than those in their earlier work. Diverging from other contemporary melodic death metal releases, the overall intensity of the album is well enhanced by the use of brutal/technical death metal-style blast beats incorporated into highly prominent, yet not obtrusive, very rapid double-Bass on the order of such bands as Kataklysm and Krisiun along with somewhat guttural, abrasive vocals, somewhat reminiscent of such bands as Six Feet Under and Cannibal Corpse. Like other Fleshcrawl albums, and death metal as a whole, the lyrical themes cover such gory, death metal-esque subjects as insanity (Structures of Death; Written In Blood), evisceration (Into the Crypts of scattered Souls; Nothing But Flesh Remains), the Grim Reaper/Harvester of Souls (Anthem of Death), demons/demonic possession (Rest in Pain; A Spirit Dressed in Black), Mortality (About Mortality), and doomsday/the apocalypse (War of the Dead). However, unlike any of their earlier releases, this album includes several references to their earlier work. Track 4, Written in Blood, includes the lines, \\"Forever more the soulskinner is back,\\" referencing to their sixth studio album, Soulskinner, and track 6, Fleshcult, which describes the mindset of death metal and the experience of the band through their 20-year history through a collection of synecdochal allusions to their previous work, including: * From the Dead to the Living and Center of Hate from Impurity * Bloodsoul from Bloodsoul * The Messenger and Beyond Belief from Bloodred Massacre * Feed the Demon's Heart from As Blood Rains from the Sky... * Soulskinner, Breeding the Dead, Legions of Hatred, and Forced to Kill from Soulskinner * Forged in Blood and Damned in Fire] from Made of Flesh Track listing # \\"Skulls Of The Rotten (Intro)\\" - 1:21 # \\"Structures Of Death\\" - 2:48 # \\"Into The Fire Of Hell\\" - 3:51 # \\"Written In Blood\\" - 3:03 # \\"A Spirit Dressed In Black\\" - 4:03 # \\"Fleshcult\\" - 3:00 # \\"Into The Crypts Of Scattered Souls\\" - 2:48 # \\"Anthem Of Death\\" - 4:58 # \\"Nothing But Flesh Remains\\" - 3:37 # \\"Rest In Pain (R.I.P.)\\" - 3:20 # \\"About Mortality\\" - 2:58 # \\"War Of The Dead\\" - 5:35 # \\"Rockin' Is My Business\\" (only included in the Digipak release) Line up * Sven Gross ‚Äì Vocals * Nico Scheffler ‚Äì Bass Guitar * Oliver Grbavac ‚Äì Guitar, Acoustic Guitar on \\"Into the Fire of Hell\\" * Mike Hanus - Guitar * Bastian Herzog ‚Äì Drums Credits * Recorded at Studio Toninfusion, Ulm, Germany, 27 April - 13 May 2007. * Engineered by Martin Schmitt, assisted by Chris Gajny. * Mixed and mastered at Studio Underground, V√§steras, Sweden, 4‚Äì7 June 2007. * Mixed by Pelle Saether & Fleshcrawl. * Mastered by Pelle Saether. * Music and lyrics by Fleshcrawl except \\"Rockin' is my Business\\" by The Four Horsemen (Starr/Lizmi/Montgomery) and \\"Structures of Death\\" lyrics by Bastian Herzog and Harold Thompson. \\"Rockin' is my Business\\" recorded at Studio Underground, V√§steras, Sweden, November 2003.

Initially a journalist, he was a successful publicist for public charities and a campaigner for the interests of indigenous Australians. Well known to Australian newspaper readers in the 1950s and 1960s for his historical features on a wide variety of topics in the Daily Mirror and other tabloids. He had innumerable artistic and literary pursuits, and his tastes were eclectic. He published poetry and plays, and in his youth was an accomplished actor. Family views Like many people at the time, their anti- fascist views led them to the far Left. They were members of the Australian Communist Party, and Kelly claimed all his life to be an adherent of Marxism, though he could never be described as orthodox. Naomi Kelly developed a public speaking career as a columnist on Australian Broadcasting Commission current affairs broadcasts. Helping her research and polish her presentations, Leo discovered his own talents for analysis and presentation of complex materials.. Medically excluded from military service in World War II, he became a journalist on the Young Mercury, transferring to the Canberra Times under the legendary Bill Shakespeare. At one stage posted to cover General Douglas MacArthur's wartime operations from his headquarters in Brisbane, Leo took up a position in the Department of Information in Melbourne in the post- war era. Returning to the private sector following the dismantling of the DOI by the incoming government of Robert Menzies, Leo brought his young family to Sydney in 1948. In 1950 they settled down in the far southern suburb of Heathcote, surrounded by his beloved Royal National Park. His constant roaming of this subtropical forest region, which he was to leave only after his final illness, was a great source of spiritual strength. Becoming an activist In the 1960s, Kelly moved from journalism to public relations, becoming the national publicity officer for the Freedom From Hunger Campaign (which sent him on a memorable research visit to India and Sri Lanka), and for Tranby College, an institution serving indigenous youth in Glebe, Sydney. His interest in indigenous affairs grew stronger in later life. In 1981 he launched a major campaign entitled Operation Aborigine, and was campaign director for the Aboriginal leader Burnum Burnum's bid for a Senate seat in the 1980s. Leo launched Goorialla, of which he was editor and principal writer, as a media vehicle for Operation Aborigine. City of Sydney Leo kept up his historical writing throughout his life, commencing an epic research project into the history of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line in the 1960s. He worked through the archives in the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide, then traveled up the route of the \\"OT\\" from Adelaide to Darwin, by bus, car and on foot. Long delayed by his other commitments, the resulting Waddilecki the String was published in 2004 when he was 90. While notionally an atheist in line with the teachings of Marx and Engels, Leo Kelly was in fact of a spiritual bent and was intrigued by mystical traditions in Buddhism, and Sufism in the Islamic world. He eventually found his transcendental moorings in Vedanta, to which he had been introduced by writers he respected like Christopher Isherwood and Aldous Huxley. Leo Kelly died on 22 August 2007 after a long illness.

Life Catherine (Worl√©e) Grand, princesse de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, painted by Fran√ßois Gerard 1805‚Äì6 Catherine No√´l Worl√©e was born in the Danish possession of Tranquebar, Tamil Nadu, India, to a French colonial official stationed at nearby Pondicherry. In 1777, her family moved to Chandannagar, where she met George Fran√ßois Grand, a British civil servant of French-Swiss Huguenot descent stationed at Calcutta (since renamed \\"Kolkata\\"). They were wed in Chandannagar in 1778, when Catherine was barely sixteen. The couple separated soon after, because of her brief but scandalous affair with Sir Philip Francis, deputy of Warren Hastings, and Madame Grand removed to London. By 1783, when Vigee Le Brun painted her portrait there, Catherine Grand had become a courtesan in Paris; she returned to Britain just before the French Revolution in 1789 and back to Paris before 1791. She served as Mistress to Claude Antoine de Valdec de Lessart, :fr:Fran√ßois-Auguste Fauveau de Fr√©nilly and others. In 1794, Mme. Grand attracted the attention of French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, with whom she lived as mistress exclusively from 1797 until 1802, when Napoleon Bonaparte pressed Talleyrand to marry her. After marriage the two gradually drifted apart. Madame Talleyrand began living alone, pursuing relationships with the Duke of San Carlos her husband eventually giving her enough money to live luxuriously in London and finally divorcing after Talleyrand entered into an arrangement with Dorothea von Biron, the wife of his nephew, the Duke of Dino. In the last few years of her life, the Princesse de B√©n√©vent returned to Paris. She died there on December 10, 1834, and her body was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery.

Bayerische Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in late January 1915.8\\\\. Bayerische Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I. The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was recruited in the Kingdom of Bavaria and was considered to be skilled in mountain warfare. Combat chronicle The 8th Bavarian Reserve Division initially fought on the Western Front, seeing its first action in the trenches in Alsace, where it remained until May 1915. It was then transferred to the Eastern Front, fighting in the breakthrough battle at Lubacz√≥w and in the 1915 Battle of Lemberg. It was sent back to the Western Front in July, again fighting in Alsace, where it remained until July 1916. From 19 July to 22 August, it fought in the Battle of the Somme. In October 1916, the division entered the Romanian Campaign, where it engaged in mountain warfare. The division remained in combat in various parts of Romania until December 1916, and then engaged in positional warfare in Transylvania until July 1917, when it went back on the offensive. In October 1917, the division returned to the Western Front, fighting in Flanders. It fought in the trenches and saw action in the Battle of Armenti√®res in April 1918, part of the Battle of the Lys (also known as the Lys Offensive and the Fourth Battle of Ypres). It continued fighting along the Western Front until the end of the war.

It is a school founded on the use of the sword, however it has several different kobuki (old weapons) in its curriculum. It is also notable for its hidden weapons (hibuki) or items that appear to hide among everyday things. History According to legend, H≈çten- ry≈´ was created by a Takizawa Minokami H≈çten in the Kii mountain range (Nanzen) of Japan at the end of the Sengoku era. Takizawa was a bushi of the Tachibana family and allegedly a friend of Sesshusai Yagy≈´ of Yagy≈´ Shinkage- ry≈´ fame. Takizawa had learned the martial arts taught in his han (prefecture) and then went to mount Kiso Ontake to study better himself. He made a pilgrimage to Ontake Shrine and Ontake waterfall in an attempt to purify his spirit and body. At Ontake it is believed that Takizawa decided to become a mountain priest. He then created the techniques for H≈çten-ry≈´ based on Shinto teachings and Shugendo practices; conforming his methods to the \\"laws of nature\\" that mountain ascetics adhere to.Nobuyuki, Hiragami. 2003. Budo and Bujutsu Magazine. Issue # 4, April. Gekan Hiden, Tokyo. The school was taught privately in a shrine near the Kiso-Ontake until the 13th inheritor Totsugawa H≈çten made his way to Ky≈çt≈ç and found a student in a very young Kazuo Taniguchi. Totsugawa, the 13th Soke, became frail with age and Kazuo succeeded him as the 14th soke when he was 19 years old, just before being conscripted into the Japanese military during World War II. As the soke of H≈çten-ry≈´, Kazuo took on the name Tachibana Kujuuin Hoten and resided in Kyoto, Japan where he had been teaching H≈çten-ry≈´ and Shod≈ç since the end of World War II until his death in May 2013.Nobuyuki, Hirgagami. 2003. Budo and BujutsuMagazine. Issue # 5, May. Gekan Hiden, Tokyo. Curriculum and weaponry H≈çten-ry≈´ first focuses on training with the sword, but there are many k≈çbuki (old weapons) and hibuki (hidden weapons). There are several primary categories which introduce multiple sub-categories and in effect creates a large curriculum. However, the techniques for each \\"sub-category\\" weapon are simple and interchangeable because the heiho (strategy) of the ryu is transmitted with each primary weapon. A short list of the armament techniques include: Jo (short staff), Ken (sword), Kusari (chain- flexible weapons), Kusarifundo (weighted chain-flexible weapons), Jutte (truncheon), Tessen (iron fan), Sasumata (two-horned polearm), Nagehari (thrown weapons), S≈çjutsu (spear), Kusarigama (sickle and chain), Tekken (\\"iron fist\\" similar to Western brass-knuckles) and Taijutsu (unarmed defense), among others. A notable category is the sanki or \\"three tools\\" (also called sandogu) which are generally affiliated with the early Japanese police.Staff. 1991. Budo and Bujutsu Magazine. 1991. Volume #5. Training The training methods for H≈çten-ry≈´ focus on striking and mechanics of the weapons, which is done in solo practice at first, utilizing natural targets. Afterwards, the kata themselves are then done in pairs as an extension of the solo practice. There are 10 steps in teaching, each based on the progression of the weapons and the skill level of the practitioner with them. The hidden weapons of H≈çten-ry≈´ are concealable and tough, generally hand made (outside of the sword and tessen) out of rough iron or natural materials. So, the creating of weapons is in fact part of the training and tradition of the ry≈´. For example, the j≈ç (short staff) is made using tree branches, which makes it different from most other ry≈´ha that use milled or machine made versions. That is to say, the jo is rough, and usually bent; the curvature of the wood is part of the techniques used within the school, so there is a unique shape that is sought after, one that is found in nature. Many other weapons made of wood require flexibility/pliability so there is a method to finding the right wood and creating them. The use of natural rope is also a part of the ry≈´, so skill in finding materials and making it is required. A basic understanding of traditional iron working is necessary, however the advent of modern machinery has sped up the process; filing and other methods (such as design) are still taught and used; traditional tools are also taught, but it follows the same route as modern methods are faster and get better results. Many of the weapons are concealed as everyday objects (or resembled the everyday objects of their era) so the altering and use of \\"existing\\" objects is also important. Sh≈çdo is also part of the training regimen and the writing and understanding of old kanji is essential. This coincides with okuden (verbal teachings) of the ry≈´ and it is essential to transmit the heiho (strategy) within the school. Documents and Scrolls H≈çten-ry≈´ is and was private school. None of the previous headmasters felt the need to list their names in encyclopedias of the martial arts or to join large martial arts organizations in the mid-twentieth century. Therefore, not much was known or recorded about the school outside the school itself until the 1940s where the 14th Soke began teaching publicly and accepting more than a handful of students at any one time. Most of the techniques of H≈çten-ry≈´ are simple and conform to mechanics of the weapon being used. Therefore, no major Densho (scrolls describing the techniques) were clearly recorded. The use of the weapons is handed down verbally, in the form of kuden (oral teachings). However, there are 3 primary scrolls concerning H≈çten-ry≈´ which are: H≈çten Ry≈´ Yuraisho (H≈çten-ry≈´ founding and history), Nancho Hokucho (secrets of the imperial family/history of the Southern and Northern court wars) and G≈çdaigen (strategy and philosophy of the ry≈´); The last of these documents G≈çdaigen is where the majority of the techniques are encrypted for the ryu, naming and outlining basic principles that are taught along with the oral teachings.  Weapons  There are a number of weapons taught in the school. The primary weapon is the sword, but there are many other weapons. In particular, the curriculum includes a large number of flexible weapons. A partial list of weapons includes:http://entendojo.weebly.com/tools.html * Bladed Weapons *# Katana (Sword) * Blunt weapons *# Tsue or Jo (Walking Stick) *# Rokushakubo (Staff) *# Tetsujo (Iron Truncheon) *# Tessen (Iron Fan) *# Te-Sasumata (Handheld Forked Weapon) *# Tekken (Knuckledusters) * Flexible weapons *# Nichokusari (Double-Weighted Chain) *# Himofundo (Weighted Rope) *# Momiji (Rope with Serrated Weight - a subset of the Himofundo) *# Nichojobin (Chains with Handles - Paired) *# Nikon (Flail, similar to Ryukyu nunchaku) *# Tebyou (Short Double-Weighted Chain) *# Bo-Kusari (Chain with Handle) *# Shakuri (Light chain with handle) *# Kusarigama (Weighted-chain with Sickle) * Thrown Weapons *# Nagehari (Throwing Needles) References Category:Ko-ry≈´ bujutsu Category:Shugend≈ç Category:Japanese martial arts ","title":"H≈çten-ry≈´"},{"id":"13059476","text":"The Stony Brook Independent, also colloquially referred to as the \\"Indie,\\" is a collegiate news publication serving Stony Brook University and the surrounding community.  History  The Independent was founded in January 2005 by Stony Brook University undergraduate students Michael Nevradakis, Jeff Licitra and Karen Mascher, to serve as an alternative hard news publication to the well-established campus paper, The Statesman (Stony Brook). Nevradakis had previously been an editor for The Statesman, before resigning in the fall of 2004, alleging that The Statesman was not following its constitution and other governing documents, a matter which reached the University's Undergraduate Student Government Judiciary. Several other writers also resigned from The Statesman that fall for similar reasons, many of whom also became founding members of the Independent as well. The name Independent was chosen to signify the new publication's identity as an unbiased, credible, objective source of news pertaining to the Stony Brook University campus, without any display of favoritism towards the University's administration, student government or any specific body of students, while striving to maintain and uphold the highest levels of journalistic ethics. The decision to maintain the Independent as a primarily online publication also reflected the founding editors' goal to provide a source of information that can be updated in real time, which would integrate other audiovisual media such as extensive photo journalism, audio and video, and which would provide a high degree of interactivity with its readers and the campus community. In its first year of operation, the Independent was published as a subsidiary publication of the Stony Brook University student chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ).Society of Professional Journalists, \\"SPJ Leads: Birthday Celebration, New Chapters Starting, Free Trips!,\\" , April 7, 2005. The Independent also affiliated with Google News, and twice had its articles appear on the front page of Google News in 2005.Screenshot of a Stony Brook Independent article featured on the front page of Google News, , Stony Brook University Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, March 10, 2005. https://news.google.com//usg.sunysb.net/clubs/media-groups/, Undergraduate Student Government at Stony Brook University. while still maintaining links with the student chapter of SPJ at Stony Brook. That fall, the Independent also made its first foray into print, through the publication of special \\"Off the Walls,\\" poster-sized publications resembling a print newspaper's front page, typically with one or two major news headlines, as well as references to the Independent's online presence. Also in fall 2005, the Independent collaborated with the Stony Brook Press, to publish a campus \\"survival guide\\" for new students, which appeared online on the Independent's website as well as in print in the Stony Brook Press Campus Survival Guide, , The Stony Brook Press, August 30, 2005.  Format  The Independent primarily focuses on hard news stories of interest to the Stony Brook University community. Feature articles, investigative reports, sports, arts and entertainment, music reviews, interviews, op-eds, polls, and editors' blogs also make up a large component of the Independent's content on a regular basis. As part of the Independent's effort to provide reputable hard news reporting, the Independent has often sent writers to cover major Stony Brook-related stories off campus, including protests in New York City Agathos, George, \\"NYC Protest 4/29/06,\\" The Stony Brook Independent,, April 29, 2006. and Washington D.C.Agathos, George, \\"Protesters March on D.C. to End the War in Iraq,\\" The Stony Brook Independent, , September 25, 2005 in which Stony Brook students participated, and sporting events, such as Stony Brook's appearance in the 2005 NCAA men's soccer semifinals at New Haven, Connecticut. In some instances, the Independent was the only University media organization to have a reporter on location at these events, such as at the NCAA men's soccer semifinals. The Independent is an alternative news publication to Stony Brook's oldest campus paper, The Statesman (Stony Brook), while differentiating itself from the more established alternative campus publication, the Stony Brook Press, by focusing more specifically on hard news content, as well as taking advantage of its web-based identity to integrate extensive audiovisual content into its articles, including audio and video clips, photography, artwork and complementary external content from such sources as Youtube. In addition, the Independent features a dynamic events calendar, publicizing events occurring on the Stony Brook University campus, and has also partnered with campusbin.com, an online textbook exchange founded by Stony Brook University students. Though the Independent is primarily a web-based news publication, through its \\"Off the Walls,\\" which are published approximately every 2‚Äì4 weeks throughout the academic year, the Independent also maintains a constant print presence throughout the University. The \\"Off the Walls\\" are typically posted, with University approval, in various high-traffic locations throughout the University, including the Student Activity Center, the Stony Brook Union, the Melville Library and the Javits Lecture Center. The Independent also works collaboratively with other recognized student media organizations on campus, including the campus chapter of SPJ, the Stony Brook Press and WUSB 90.1 FM, the University's FCC-licensed non-commercial radio station, where some of the Independent's editors and staffers currently host a live, weekly talk show, \\"In Focus\\" (https://web.archive.org/web/20080515155340/http://www.infocusradio.org/). The Independent makes its articles and photography available to other campus media organizations, with proper attribution. The Independent also maintains close ties with the University's fledgling School of Journalism, and many journalism students have had their articles published by the Independent, as part of the overall requirements for their course and major. Closely related to its work with the School of Journalism, the Independent's editorial board often sponsors tutorials and seminars for any interested student to learn the finer points of such topics as news writing and photography. Finally, the Independent also is an active participant in many campus-wide student media initiatives, including the Student Media Council (SMC) and the Martin Buskin Journalism Committee. As a part of the SMC, the Independent's editors have been invited to interview University President Shirley Strum Kenny on a regular basis, and have access to all University press and media events, press releases and other content made available to media entities.  Structure  The Independent is run entirely by students, both undergraduate and graduate, but has also featured content submissions from the campus and surrounding community, and world at large. The Independent holds weekly meetings during the academic year, open to all students, and is also an active participant in the University's Student Media Council, an advisory group encompassing all of the University's recognized student media organizations. Though the Independent was first launched as a subsidiary publication of the Stony Brook University campus chapter of SPJ, the Independent, as of fall 2005, is officially registered as a stand-alone student publication by the University's Undergraduate Student Government (USG), as well as by the University's Graduate Student Organization (GSO), and is advised by a member of the University's staff. The Independent maintains close ties with the campus chapter of SPJ, as well as SPJ's regional chapter for Long Island, the Press Club of Long Island. Similarly to its counterpart, the Stony Brook Statesman, the Independent is managed through a not-for-profit corporation, known as SBI News, Inc., registered in Suffolk County, New York. The Independent maintains an office in the \\"media wing\\" of the Stony Brook Union, where most other campus media organizations are also headquartered. The Independent does not receive funding from the USG or the GSO. This reflects the Independent's standing editorial policy of maintaining a greater degree of independence from the student government than other on-campus media organizations which do receive student government funds. The relative lack of overhead of a web-based publication compared to a print publication has also reduced the necessity of applying for funding from any student government body. The Independent is funded from limited advertising on its website and \\"Off the Walls,\\" as well as grants and the out-of-pocket donations of its editors, staffers and alumni. The Independent maintains a current staff size of approximately 25 writers and editors, all of whom possess official Stony Brook University media credentials and have access to all events taking place on campus as a result.  Recognition  Largely as a result of the successful launch of the Independent in 2005, Region 1 of the Society of Professional Journalists (encompassing most of the Northeastern United States) named the Stony Brook University student chapter, which oversaw the launch, as \\"chapter of the year\\" for 2005.Society of Professional Journalists, \\"2005 Convention Roundup,\\" Quill Magazine, December 2005. Page 14. Several Independent editors and staffers have also been recognized by the University's Martin Buskin Committee for Outstanding Campus Journalism, an organization of Stony Brook University faculty and staff, as well as Stony Brook University alums who are employed in the field of professional journalism and who, in their student days, were actively involved in campus journalism.Martin Buskin Committee for Outstanding Campus Journalism, \\"Buskin Committee,\\" The awards are issued annually and are sponsored by Newsday. In 2006, the Independent's Executive Editor, George Agathos, won the Martin Buskin Cub Award for Outstanding Campus Journalism; an award which is given to that year's outstanding student journalist who is a freshman or sophomore at the University. Also that year, Independent writer Radeyah Hack won the Martin Buskin Award for Outstanding Campus Journalism (awarded to a junior or senior). In 2005, Michael Nevradakis, one of the founding members of the Independent and its inaugural Editor-in-Chief, won the Martin Buskin Award for Outstanding Campus Journalism, as a result of his work in helping launch the Independent.Martin Buskin Committee for Outstanding Campus Journalism, \\"Award Winners,\\"  References  External links *The Stony Brook Independent *The Martin Buskin Journalism Committee *WUSB 90.1 FM *Society of Professional Journalists *Press Club of Long Island *Stony Brook University Campus Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists Category:Undergraduate Student Government at Stony Brook University Category:Stony Brook University Category:Student newspapers published in New York (state) ","title":"Stony Brook Independent"},{"id":"13059503","text":"Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr. (May 16, 1859 ‚Äì 1936) was an American businessman.

It allowed users to listen to radio channels and digital television from around the house. History The Sky Gnome was released in September 2005 and was available until mid-2007 with a retail price of ¬£75. Although Sky no longer markets the 'Gnome', it is still possible to use existing units. Until recent times, the website was available to use, but now it shows the message: \\"I'm Gone,\\", as well as the manufacturer's website (though that is covered with a simple domain holding page). The Gnome had many advantages compared to a DAB receiver: It provides more stations than a DAB radio, and the broadcasts are almost all of higher audio quality on satellite than via DAB. It works anywhere in the UK that has a satellite installation compared to DAB which does not have universal coverage. It is also able to provide British digital radio to non-UK residents, and as such it is very popular among the British expat community. A major disadvantage, however, was the device was not strictly a radio device and instead was effectively an external speaker - meaning it was not possible for one person to use the Sky TV service and another to listen to a different radio station. Technical information The Sky Gnome used a 433 MHz digital communication link to communicate information to and from the Digibox, the audio was sent on ch 1: 863.4 MHz / ch 2: 863.8 MHz / ch 3: 864.2 MHz / ch 4: 864.6 MHz. The Sky Gnome sender box connected to the main Digibox using the RS232, audio out and RF2 out connections. The Sky Gnome was compatible with the Sky and Sky+ Digiboxes. When used in a non-Sky satellite receiver, it was possible to listen to the radio channels, it was possible to change the channels of the receiver from the Sky Gnome.

The property was built and is owned and operated by Los Angeles businessman Rick J. Caruso and his company Caruso Affiliated. Caruso Affiliated has built and operates many other projects, including The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles. The Americana at Brand's 82 retail shops include Barneys New York, Nordstrom, XXI Forever, and David Yurman; its restaurants include Din Tai Fung, Bourbon Steak by Michael Mina, and Katsuya; the complex comprises 100 condominiums and 242 luxury apartments. The Americana project stirred debate in Glendale for four years. Some merchants feared the Grove-style \\"lifestyle center\\" would diminish business at the stores along Brand Boulevard and in the Glendale Galleria. Some residents worried about overdevelopment and traffic congestion. Both The Americana at Brand and The Grove are organized upon the idea of a city center‚Äîwith a mix of architectural styles, building heights and materials used, as well as vast open spaces at each project's center. Caruso Affiliated often casts its developments in a particular milieu. The architectural style of the Americana reflects the brick factory facades of the industrial era, with its massive elevator shaft with exposed steel beams, while The Grove is reminiscent of 1930s Los Angeles, California. Each of the two intends to appear to be a public space, but is private property and is protected as such. However, the two-acre park in the center of the complex is entirely public property. The private security force that patrols the property prevents anyone from taking photographs with professional equipment without permission. The Americana at Brand allows dogs on the property ‚Äî except on its grassy area. The only breed restricted is the pit bull. Each store decides whether it allows pets. The project opened to the public on May 2, 2008. Glendale Shops and restaurants The Americana at Brand shares some of its retail and dining options with sister center The Grove at Farmers Market, such as a three-level flagship Barnes & Noble as well as Barneys New York, J.Crew, Apple, Kiehl's, The Cheesecake Factory, Topshop Topman, and Anthropologie, and is anchored by a three-level Nordstrom. It also features a XXI Forever, a two- level H&M;, Urban Outfitters, Calvin Klein, an 18-theater Pacific Theaters cinema, American Eagle Outfitters, and higher-end stores like, Tiffany and Co., David Yurman, and Marciano. Some of the restaurants at The Americana at Brand are local concepts, such as Frida Mexican Cuisine, Chi Dynasty, and Trattoria Amici, as well as internationally recognized restaurants including Din Tai Fung, and Bourbon Steak by Michael Mina. List of tenants As of July 2017, there are over 80 tenants in the Americana. Anchors *Nordstrom (opened in 2013, formerly occupied at the Glendale Galleria) *Barnes & Noble *Pacific Theatres (18 screens) *Barneys New York (closed due to bankruptcy) *XXI Forever *H&M; Specialty stores and services Some notable tenants (not including anchors) include Anthropologie, Ray-Ban, Tiffany & Co., David Yurman, Calvin Klein, Sephora, Disney Baby (so far their only location), Fantastic Sams, Apple, Tesla, Sur La Table, and Urban Outfitters.

Attractions In addition to The Americana at Brand's upscale shops, restaurants and movie theater, the outdoor mall features Waters of Americana, an animated fountain by WET. The musical fountain, located in the central landscaped park, performs every hour on the hour, though a non-musical program runs between shows. A gold-leaf statue, chosen by developer Rick Caruso, rises from the center of the fountain's smaller pool. The statue is a replica of Donald De Lue's 1949 Spirit of American Youth sculpture in France, a memorial to Americans who fought at Normandy in World War II. The statue also serves as the icon for The Americana at Brand.

It is uninhabited, but known to be used by scuba divers who amongst other things view the underwater zoanthids near it. William Beebe visited the islands and makes mention of them in his book Galapagos: World's End, he described the cliffs as majestic and made of stratified layers of volcanic tuff. He also noted a population of sealions. The island is perhaps best known and most noted for its name; which is derived from a controversial historical English figure. Guy Fawkes, the man it is named after was a Roman Catholic revolutionary who had attempted to carry out the Gunpowder Plot in 1605.

A fan of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, she uses stage gestures and musical dynamics often found in jazz and folk-dixie tunes. Riko Prayitno (guitar) was born on 29 January 1977 in Bogor, West Java. Like Simangunsong, he graduated from the National Institute of Technology. He began playing guitar at an early age and began playing professionally with Simangunsong in college. He also had a side project, The Triangle Band. Ahmad Pratama (a.k.a. Toma) (bass) was born on 27 June 1976 in Bandung, West Java. A product designer by training, Toma has excelled in setting up the key components of their music. His punctual bass tone accentuates the tempo and rhythm set by Indra's drumming skill. His influences include Sting and Phil Collins. Indra Massad (drums) was born on 31 January 1976 in Medan, North Sumatra. He and Toma studied product design in Bandung together and joined Mocca at about the same time. Unlike other drummers that use many tom-toms and cymbals, Indra prefers the simplicity and versatility of a single snare drum. His brush technique during acoustic sessions acts just like seven different mallets making seven different tones.

Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans. Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in. However, some body parts contain multiple types of tissue, so for greater precision, cancers are additionally classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells originated from. These types include: * Carcinoma: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers that occur in older adults. Nearly all cancers developing in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and colon are carcinomas. * Sarcoma: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside of the bone marrow. * Lymphoma and leukemia: These two classes of cancer arise from immature cells that originate in the bone marrow, and are intended to fully differentiate and mature into normal components of the immune system and the blood, respectively. Leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children accounting for about 30%. However, far more adults than children develop lymphoma and leukemia. * Germ cell tumor: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively). * Blastoma: Cancers derived from immature \\"precursor\\" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are generally, but not always, more common in children than in older adults. Cancers are usually named using -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, the most common cancer of the liver parenchyma (\\"hepato-\\" = liver), arising from malignant epithelial cells (\\"carcinoma\\"), would be called a hepatocarcinoma, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma. Similarly, a cancer arising from malignant fat cells would be termed a liposarcoma. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast. Here, the adjective ductal refers to the appearance of the cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts. Benign tumors (which are not cancers) are usually named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is fibroid). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the -noma suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma. Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and small- cell carcinoma.  Bone and muscle sarcoma  * Chondrosarcoma * Ewing's sarcoma * Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone/osteosarcoma * Osteosarcoma * Rhabdomyosarcoma * Heart cancer  Brain and nervous system  * Astrocytoma * Brainstem glioma * Pilocytic astrocytoma * Ependymoma * Primitive neuroectodermal tumor * Cerebellar astrocytoma * Cerebral astrocytoma * Glioma * Medulloblastoma * Neuroblastoma * Oligodendroglioma * Pineal astrocytoma * Pituitary adenoma * Visual pathway and hypothalamic glioma  Breast  * Breast cancer * Invasive lobular carcinoma * Tubular carcinoma * Invasive cribriform carcinoma * Medullary carcinoma * Male breast cancer * Phyllodes tumor * Inflammatory Breast Cancer  Endocrine system  * Adrenocortical carcinoma * Islet cell carcinoma (endocrine pancreas) * Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome * Parathyroid cancer * Pheochromocytoma * Thyroid cancer * Merkel cell carcinoma  Eye  * Uveal melanoma * Retinoblastoma  Gastrointestinal  * Anal cancer * Appendix cancer * cholangiocarcinoma * Carcinoid tumor, gastrointestinal * Colon cancer * Extrahepatic bile duct cancer * Gallbladder cancer * Gastric (stomach) cancer * Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor * Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) * Hepatocellular cancer * Pancreatic cancer, islet cell * Rectal cancer  Genitourinary and gynecologic  * Bladder cancer * Cervical cancer * Endometrial cancer * Extragonadal germ cell tumor * Ovarian cancer * Ovarian epithelial cancer (surface epithelial-stromal tumor) * Ovarian germ cell tumor * Penile cancer * Renal cell carcinoma * Renal pelvis and ureter, transitional cell cancer * Prostate cancer * Testicular cancer * Gestational trophoblastic tumor * Ureter and renal pelvis, transitional cell cancer * Urethral cancer * Uterine sarcoma * Vaginal cancer * Vulvar cancer * Wilms tumor  Head and neck  * Esophageal cancer * Head and neck cancer * Nasopharyngeal carcinoma * Oral cancer * Oropharyngeal cancer * Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer * Pharyngeal cancer * Salivary gland cancer * Hypopharyngeal cancer  Hematopoietic  * Acute biphenotypic leukemia * Acute eosinophilic leukemia * Acute lymphoblastic leukemia * Acute myeloid leukemia * Acute myeloid dendritic cell leukemia * AIDS-related lymphoma * Anaplastic large cell lymphoma * Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma * B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia * Burkitt's lymphoma * Chronic lymphocytic leukemia * Chronic myelogenous leukemia * Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma * Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma * Follicular lymphoma * Hairy cell leukemia * Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma * Hodgkin's lymphoma * Hairy cell leukemia * Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma * Large granular lymphocytic leukemia * Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma * Lymphomatoid granulomatosis * Mantle cell lymphoma * Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma * Mast cell leukemia * Mediastinal large B cell lymphoma * Multiple myeloma/plasma cell neoplasm * Myelodysplastic syndromes * Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma * Mycosis fungoides * Nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma * Non-Hodgkin lymphoma * Precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia * Primary central nervous system lymphoma * Primary cutaneous follicular lymphoma * Primary cutaneous immunocytoma * Primary effusion lymphoma * Plasmablastic lymphoma * S√©zary syndrome * Splenic marginal zone lymphoma * T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia  Skin  * Basal cell carcinoma * Squamous cell carcinoma * Skin adnexal tumors (e.g. sebaceous carcinoma) * Melanoma * Merkel cell carcinoma * Sarcomas of primary cutaneous origin (e.g. dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans) * Lymphomas of primary cutaneous origin (e.g. mycosis fungoides)  Thoracic and respiratory  * Bronchial adenomas/carcinoids * Small cell lung cancer * Mesothelioma * Non-small cell lung cancer * Pleuropulmonary blastoma * Laryngeal cancer * Thymoma and thymic carcinoma  HIV/AIDS related  * AIDS-related cancers * Kaposi sarcoma  Unsorted (so far)  * Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) * Desmoplastic small round cell tumor * Liposarcoma See also * Lists of diseases * List of oncology-related terms References * A to Z List of Cancers National Cancer Institute  External links  Cancer types ","title":"List of cancer types"},{"id":"13059711","text":"Nigel Henry Cockburn Butterley AM (born 13 May 1935) is an Australian composer and pianist.

It commenced in 1984, as a result of an amalgamation of Christian Brothers' College and Prendiville College. Its motto \\"Justice, Peace, Charity\\" includes the three beginning letters of the school's name: J, P and C. History Archbishop Redmond Prendiville Sr Concepta with a group of Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart  Christian Brothers' College  Christian Brothers' College was founded in 1906 in Wilson Street, by B Duggan, who served as Principal for ten years. Throughout its seventy-seven years, the College served the people of the Eastern Goldfields who supported the school, especially in time of financial hardship. In 1976 the college was relocated at Lionel Street by Bernard T Murphy. Hence, it continued its service to education with more modern facilities and more spacious grounds.  Prendiville College  Prendiville College was founded in 1971, replacing the four small existing secondary sections of the Parish schools. The college was founded as the Prendiville Catholic Girls College, named in honour of the late Archbishop Redmond Prendiville (Bishop of Perth between 1933‚Äì1968). The first Principal was Sr. Concepta (Sisters of St. Joseph). The uniform was green and orange.  Merger  In 1984 Christian Brothers College amalgamated with Prendiville College. The new school was aptly named John Paul College after Pope John Paul II, elected as Pope in 1978. For the first time a co-educational Catholic secondary school functioned in Kalgoorlie. The Christian Brothers and the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart have been on the Eastern Goldfields since the turn of the century.http://www.jpc.wa.edu.au/history.html Accessed 29 May 2008  Overview  Currently, John Paul College has approximately 700 students under the guidance of Principal, Brad Hall.

City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a \\"breach of peace\\" ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which \\"stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance\\" was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.. Background Arthur Terminiello, a Catholic priest under suspension, was giving a speech to the Christian Veterans of America in which he criticized various racial groups and made a number of inflammatory comments. There were approximately 800 people present in the auditorium where he was giving the speech and a crowd of approximately 1,000 people outside, protesting the speech. The Chicago Police Department was present, but was unable to maintain order completely. Terminiello was later assessed a fine of 100 dollars for violation of Chicago's breach of peace ordinance, which he appealed. Both the Illinois Appellate Court and Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.City of Chicago v. Terminiello, 332 Ill. App. 17, 74 N.E.2d 45 (App. 1st Dist. 1947); affirmed, 400 Ill. 23, 79 N.E.2d 39 (1948). The US Supreme Court granted certiorari.. Majority opinion Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, reversed Terminiello's conviction, holding that his speech was protected by the First Amendment (which was made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment) but also that the ordinance, as construed by the Illinois courts, was unconstitutional. Douglas explained that the purpose of free speech was to invite dispute even where it incites people to anger; in fact, the provocative and inflammatory content of speech could potentially be seen as positive. Although Douglas acknowledged that freedom of speech was not limitless and did not apply to \\"fighting words\\" (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire), he held that such limitations were inapplicable here: > The vitality of civil and political institutions in our society depends on > free discussion. As Chief Justice Hughes wrote in De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 > U.S. 353, 365, 260, it is only through free debate and free exchange of > ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and > peaceful change is effected. The right to speak freely and to promote > diversity of ideas and programs is therefore one of the chief distinctions > that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes. > Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to > invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a > condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or > even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It > may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling > effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of > speech, though not absolute, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, 315 U.S. at > pages 571-572, 62 S.Ct. at page 769, is nevertheless protected against > censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present > danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public > inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. See Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. > 252, 262, 193, 159 A.L.R. 1346; Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 373, 1253. > There is no room under our Constitution for a more restrictive view. For the > alternative would lead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures, > courts, or dominant political or community groups.Terminiello, 337 U.S. at > 4-5. Dissenting opinions Vinson's dissent Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson dissented on the ground that the jury instruction which the majority objected to had been affirmed by both appellate courts. He felt that the Illinois courts had construed the ordinance only as punishing fighting words and that petitioner's counsel had not previously objected to the instruction below on constitutional grounds. Frankfurter's dissent Justice Felix Frankfurter largely echoed the sentiments of Chief Justice Vinson, feeling that the majority was going out of its way to reverse Terminiello's fine, when such an action went against the balance of power between the federal and state courts: > Freedom of speech undoubtedly means freedom to express views that challenge > deep-seated, sacred beliefs and to utter sentiments that may provoke > resentment. But those indulging in such stuff as that to which this > proceeding gave rise are hardly so deserving as to lead this Court to single > them out as beneficiaries of the first departure from the restrictions that > bind this Court in reviewing judgments of State courts. Especially odd is it > to bestow such favor not for the sake of life or liberty, but to save a > small amount of property -- $100, the amount of the fine imposed upon the > petitioner in a proceeding which is civil, not criminal, under the laws of > Illinois, and thus subject only to limited review.Terminiello, 337 U.S. at > 11-12 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Jackson's dissent Justice Jackson's dissent was considerably longer and more elaborate than Vinson's or Frankfurter's. Jackson felt the majority was ignoring the very real concern of maintaining public order, and that the majority's generalized suspicion of any restriction of free speech was blinding them to the fact that a riot was occurring at Terminiello's place of speaking. His basic argument was that although the First Amendment protects the expression of ideas, it does not protect them absolutely, in all circumstances, regardless of the danger it may create to the public at large. To underscore his point, Jackson reiterated the testimony given at trial by Terminiello himself, as well as excerpts from Terminiello's speech (in which he made anti-semitic remarks, inflammatory comments about various U.S. government officials, and statements praising fascist leaders), in order to demonstrate the chaotic and violent scene in which Terminiello was speaking. Jackson framed Terminiello's speech and the violent fracas which surrounded it in the context of the global struggle between fascism and communism in the post-World War II world. He feared that these two groups, dominated as they were by radicals and accustomed to using violent means to propagate their ideology, were a threat to legitimate democratic governments and that the court's decision would greatly reduce the power of local law enforcement authorities to keep such violence in check. In doing so, Jackson quoted from Mein Kampf, to date the only reference to the Hitler work in a Supreme Court opinion. Jackson also noted that without the help of the Chicago Police Department, Terminiello would not have even been able to give his speech and that the majority's opinion was not in line with the \\"clear and present danger\\" test set forth in Schenck v. United States. Jackson's dissent in this case is most famous for its final paragraph: > This Court has gone far toward accepting the doctrine that civil liberty > means the removal of all restraints from these crowds and that all local > attempts to maintain order are impairments of the liberty of the citizen. > The choice is not between order and liberty. It is between liberty with > order and anarchy without either. There is danger that, if the Court does > not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will > convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.Terminiello, > 337 U.S. at 36 (Jackson, J., dissenting).

Due to legal issues with Square Enix they were forced to change the title and characters while maintaining the core game play. Story The story is different in single- and multi-player modes, but the gameplay remains identical. In single player, the story centers around the snow goddess Sayuki's love for a boy who lives in a nearby village. Upon visiting the village one day, she learns that the boy has fallen under a curse, sleeping permanently. Sayuki then travels across the land with her pet snow rabbit, Toto, to find the ingredients for the cure to his curse. In multiplayer, the story is about a beauty contest held by the Snow Goddess Tribe. Sayuki and her younger sister, Koyuki, decide to compete for first place. The contest is a trial race for the two sisters to destroy the most ghosts and collect the most snowballs in their path, Gameplay Heavenly Guardian, like the Kiki KaiKai series, is a scrolling shooter where the player moves a character in any direction and fire projectiles at enemies. It can be played alone, or cooperatively with a second player controlling Sayuki's sister, Koyuki. In single-player, Sayuki is followed by Toto, her pet snow rabbit, who shoots freezing shots in the same direction Sayuki attacks. Upon defeating bosses in the story mode, they can be rebattled in the Boss Attack mode. The Wii version can only be played using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Unlike the PS2 version, which only allows the player to fire the direction a character is facing, the Wii version offers the option to aim and fire with the Wii Remote's pointer. This can either be permanently on (called \\"FlameIN\\" on the option menu) or be switched on by holding the Z button on the Nunchuk. While aiming you cannot use Toto's freezing shots as he acts as the cursor. Development Heavenly Guardian was originally an intended GameCube and later Wii sequel to Taito's Kiki KaiKai series (better known as Pocky & Rocky outside Japan) called simply \\"Kiki KaiKai 2\\". The game was canceled, as Starfish SD lost the Kiki KaiKai license, but would later resurface as a Wii game entitled \\"Kiki Kai World\\". This version was mostly similar to the canceled Wii game, but with the main character's miko outfit recolored from red to blue. Instead of being a direct sequel to the original, it was more of a spiritual successor, as to avoid legal issues with Taito and its parent company, Square Enix.\\"Full Kiki Kai World Details: PS2 This Year, Wii 2008\\" blog.wired.com. URL Accessed on June 8, 2008 To further separate the game from Kiki KaiKai, the graphics and theme of the game were completely redone, replacing the miko heroine with a snow goddess named Sayuki. When approached about the subject, a company spokesperson said \\"To make a long story short, Taito, who is now owned by Square [Enix], had some issues with us and we had to let the title go,\\" implying that Square Enix was the reason behind the initial cancellation. Although Starfish chose to only release a Wii version in Japan, UFO released a PS2 version in North America, due to having control over the release platforms in the region.\\"UFO Interactive Games discusses Heavenly Guardian and The Monkey King\\" www.siliconera.com. URL Accessed on June 8, 2008 505 Games is also releasing both versions in Europe. Reception Although just a few magazines reviewed the game, Heavenly Guardian received poor ratings by the press. GameSpot reviewer Kevin VanOrd gave the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 3.0 out of 10.0 in his review, citing archaic mechanics and frustrating gameplay as negative aspects of the game. He closed his review with \\"Don't be fooled by the promise of fun throwback gameplay. Heavenly Guardian may look to the past, but it is too bland and frustrating to evoke fond memories of 'the good old days.'\\" IGN editor Sam Bishop also reviewed both versions of Heavenly Guardian, rating it with 4.0 out of 10.0, stating in his closing comments, \\"Heavenly Guardian is an affront to everything that games are now and were back in the day.\\"PS2 reviewWii review References External links Archived Kiki KaiKai 2 site *Overview of the Pocky & Rocky series Category:2007 video games Category:505 Games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Wii games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Unauthorized video games ","title":"Heavenly Guardian"},{"id":"13059949","text":"Minh (Ch·ªØ N√¥m: Êòé) is popular unisex given name of Vietnamese origin, written using the Chinese character (Êòé) meaning \\"bright,\\" popular in East Asian names.

It was closed and dismantled in October 2008. History View from the balloon of the heritage quarter and office towers The DHL Balloon was first located on Tan Quee Lan Street in the Downtown Core of Singapore, near the New 7th Storey Hotel and Bugis MRT station. Launched at a cost of $2.5 million, the DHL Balloon was a joint venture by Aerophile Balloon Singapore Pte Ltd and Vertical Adventure Pte Ltd, and took one year to plan. The project was sponsored by global courier, freight and logistics company DHL Express which received exclusive advertising space on the balloon. The business partners involved in the project worked with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Singapore Land Authority and Singapore Tourism Board to allow public advertising on the balloon, and arranged to lease the site at a cost of more than S$1 million over two years. Prior to this project, large advertisements in public areas were not allowed in Singapore. S$800,000 was spent priming the ground for the balloon and another S$60,000 to purchase the helium. On 19 April 2006, 40 crew members took 12 hours to inflate the French-made balloon, which took its first passengers in May 2006. The DHL Balloon was operated by Singapore Ducktours, a company which also offers city tours on its amphibious vehicles. By September 2007, more than 150,000 people had ridden on the balloon, 70% of whom were tourists. Up to 1,000 people rode the balloon each weekend and its usage was the highest among all of Aerophile's balloons. The DHL Balloon's lease on its site on Tan Quee Lan Street expired in August 2008 and URA terminated the lease as the site was to be used for the new Downtown line's Bugis MRT station. Singapore Ducktours considered three alternative sites: Beach Road near Park View Hotel, Clarke Quay near Novotel Clarke Quay Hotel, and Gardens by the Bay at Marina Bay but was told by the authorities that these sites were unavailable. Other plans included relocating the balloon to Kuala Lumpur or Johor Bahru in Malaysia. Terminating the venture would cost the company S$1.2 million. Unable to find a suitable site at which to continue operations, Singapore Ducktours dismantled the DHL Balloon in October 2008. Ride The DHL Balloon taking-off Passengers could ride the DHL Balloon and have a view of Singapore's Central Area, including the central business district, Suntec City, Marina Bay, Orchard Road and Little India, and could see Indonesia and Malaysia. Standard flights to 150 metres typically lasted between seven and ten minutes and higher level flights to 180 metres lasted up to 13 minutes. Features and specifications The DHL Balloon measured 22 metres in diameter and was filled with 6,500 cubic metres of helium. It was certified as an aircraft. It was one of only fifteen similar balloons around the world in cities including Paris and Hong Kong made by Aerophile. As the balloon was anchored to the ground with a metal cable, it was only able to ascend and descend vertically. It was approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to ascend to a maximum altitude of 180 metres, or around 48 stories. Flights to either 150 metres or 180 metres were offered. It could accommodate a maximum of 29 passengers in its gondola. Piloting The balloon, which flew between two and six times an hour, was operated by a pilot within the gondola. A hydro-electric winch system controlled take-off and landing. As a safety measure, the balloon was not flown when there was lightning, rain, or when the wind speed exceeded five knots on the ground as measured by an anemometer. Maintenance A crew of six pilots worked in rotation with one on duty at any one time. They conducted routine checks daily, weekly and every three months on the balloon and its equipment. The helium was replenished every four to six months and engineers visited the balloon each year to conduct an inspection.

It is characterised by its height and unique position on top of a cliff. It is one of the most beautiful villages of France (along with 157 others, including neighbouring Loubressac, Autoire, Curemonte and Carennac). It also has a well-known castle. Geography Turenne sits atop the Martel Causse, a limestone formation which now supports rich forests as well as intricate caves. The region is quite hilly, and is cut through by the Dordogne and V√©z√®re rivers, which provide nearby activities like canoeing. Economy The local economy is primarily agricultural, with a fair amount of tourism. The region is known for its excellent produce, including walnuts, mushrooms, truffles, and foie gras. History The first lords of Turenne appeared in the 9th century. The town became a veritable feudal state after the Crusades and one of the great fiefs of France in the 14th century. From the Middle Ages to the 18th century, the viscount of Turenne had complete autonomy. Until 1738 the sheriffs, despite honoring the French king with simple tributes, were free of taxation and acted as true sovereigns; convening the Estates General, raising taxes, coining money, and ennobling. The Viscounty formed a state within a state. Thus, when the king banned tobacco (introduced in Aquitaine in 1560), the measure did not apply in the viscounty. The fiefdom of Turenne occupied a territory bounded by three provinces and three bishoprics. Part of the P√©rigord Noir (Black P√©rigord), the fiefdom was adjacent to Lower Limousin and Quercy. It controlled the transfer of livestock between the plateaus of Quercy and Limousin, At its largest in the 15th century, it spanned from around Meymac or Lapleau to the north-east, Terrasson to the west, and Gramat to the south. At that time, the major fortified cities of the Viscount were Argentat, Servieres, Beaulieu, Gagnac, Martel, Saint- Cere, and Turenne; other walled cities included the bastides of Bretenoux and Puybrun, the cities of Carennac, Vayrac, Curemonte, Meyssac, and Collonges. There are now about 100,000 inhabitants in the entire region, divided into 18,500 \\"feux\\", 111 parishes, 1200 villages, and many monasteries. Turenne has seen a succession of four families of Viscounts. From the 9th century to the thirteenth, the Comborn, from the valley of the V√©z√®re (and who had actively participated in the Crusades and Anglo-French wars) obtained extensive privileges from the kings of France. Then, during the first half of the 14th century, the Viscounty was taken over by the Comminges, Pyren√©es feudal lords, before being transferred for 94 years to Roger de Beaufort from which came two Popes of Avignon, Clement VI and Gregory XI. This family had two Viscounts: Roger William III of Beaufort and Raymond de Turenne XIII, and two viscountesses names Antoinette de Turenne and Eleonore de Beaujeu. Then, from 1444 to 1738, the Viscounty became the possession of the family of La Tour d'Auvergne. In their heyday, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, co-religionist and companion-at-arms of King Henry IV, became Duke of Bouillion and prince of Sedan. His son Henry, Marshal of France, received the nickname \\"The Great Turenne.\\" Under La Tour d'Auvergne, the Viscounty lasted until the Reformation. Calvinism was spread by the boatmen of the Dordogne throughout the region. In 1575, after St. Bartholomew, Henri de la Tour engaged with Henri of Navarre and Turenne became a hotbed of religious wars and disorders of the Fronde. On 8 June 1738, Turenne was sold to Louis XV to pay the gambling debts of Charles Godfrey, the last of the Viscounts of La Tour d'Auvergne family. Thus ended the quasi-independence of this last French stronghold. The Viscounty's subjects became subjects of Louis XV and were forced to pay taxes. The king also ordered the dismantling of the fortress of Turenne. As of the Revolution, Turenne was more like a seat of a royal provost. Under the French Revolution, to follow a decree of the Convention, the town changed its name to Mount Franc (the name was restored to Turenne in ??).

Originally presented by Andy Craig and assisted by antiques expert Eric Knowles, the final series was hosted by Stuart Hall. The programme's format was simple: three celebrities described an antique and gave it a valuation. One is telling the truth and the other two are lying. The two contestants had to guess which description was true, and were awarded points if they guessed correctly. A film of the real auction would be shown with the item described being bid for. In the final round, both players 'bid' for an item by trying to guess the value that the antique went for with the person finishing with the nearest price winning the bonus points. The winner would take home an antique as a prize and the loser took home a 'booby prize' of a flying duck, the show's motif, mounted on a plaque. In fact, every contestant really wanted the flying duck. Celebrities included Eric Knowles, Anne Gregg, Jilly Goolden, Tim Wonnacott, Lowri Turner and Simon Hoggart.

In 826 he was baptized together with his parents in Mainz in the Frankish Empire, with crown prince Lothair standing as a godparent. After his baptism, Godfrid stayed in Lothair's retinue, until they fell out sometime in the 840s, and Godfrid returned to Denmark. There he teamed up with Rorik, the son of his father's brother (his cousin). In 850 they united against Lothair and raided Dorestad. Rorik took possession of Frisia. Godfrid continued to plunder Flanders and Artois, and returned to Denmark for the winter. In 851 he was back, raiding in Frisia and around the Rhine, then sailed up the Scheldt to attack Ghent and the abbey of Drongen. After another winter in Denmark, Godfred returned again in 853 to Francia. On 9 October 853 he sailed up the Seine. The fleet advanced beyond Rouen, as far as Pont-de-l'Arche, and encamped on an island near Les Andelys. Charles the Bald summoned his army as well as that of the Middle Kingdom of Lothar, Godfred's godfather. The two sides faced each other the whole winter, the Frankish land army lacking boats to attack the Vikings. The stalemate was resolved in the spring of 853 when Godfred sailed away, probably with a tribute. In 855 Godfred and his cousin Rorik tried to gain power in Denmark after the death of king Horik I. The attempt failed, and they returned the same year, taking back Dorestad and a large part of the area of what is now The Netherlands. After this, the sources are silent about this Godfred. He probably died soon afterwards.

James John Charles Horsey James (30 January 1841 in Rome, Italy ‚Äì 3 February 1899 in Perth, Western Australia) was a magistrate in Western Australia and the inaugural president of the Western Australian Cricket Association from 1885. He was the son of Rev. John H. James of Highfield, rector of Avington, Berkshire and his second wife Theodosia Mary Tennant, of 'Romansleigh' in North Devon. He was educated at Rugby School between 1854 and 1860, and later at Oxford University, where he was awarded his law degree in 1864. At Rugby he sat under Dr Frederick Temple, the Archbishop of Canterbury and at Oxford played cricket in the first eleven of Exeter College. Choosing law as his profession, he enrolled at the Inner Temple and in November 1866 was called to the bar, where he practised on the Oxford circuit. In 1875, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Earl Carnarvon offered James the position of Commissioner of Titles for Western Australia, with the task of implementing the Torrens title transfer of lands system at that colony. He accepted the offer, becoming one of the last imperial appointments to colonial administrative positions made direct from the home government. Western Australia James arrived in Western Australia in July 1875 with the task of expanding and improving the Titles Office. He held the position until his death in 1899. At times, James acted as Registrar of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, Registrar in bankruptcy, and Stipendiary Magistrate of Perth. He was gazetted as a Justice of the Peace for the colony in 1886 and Police Magistrate in June 1897. In June 1887 he was appointed as the fourth nominee member of the Western Australian Legislative Council during the absence of Sir John Forrest in London. He sat for two sessions and retired in February 1888. He also held positions of Resident Magistrate, Guildford from September 1887 for a time and again between about 1897 and 1898. He was acting Puisne Judge between February 1898 and January 1899.

He held the presidency of the Association from 1884 to 1899. James played with the Metropolitans/Perth Cricket Club. He married Rebecca Catherine Clifton, eldest daughter of Charles Hippuff Clifton at St George's Church in Perth on 16 September 1885. They had seven children, the youngest being actor and soldier M. E. Clifton James. As well as having an avid interest in cricket, James was involved in a number of other sports and sporting associations including being a steward of the Western Australian Turf Club from 1887 to 1897. He was also president of the Swan River Mechanics' Institute from 1887 and was involved in the arts with an interest in amateur Shakespearean theatre as well as in music, painting and sculpture. Socially, he was a leading figure in the community. After his father's death in 1886, he inherited the family Gloucester and Devon estates. James built a grand English style residence in Goderich Street, Perth called Romansleigh, named after the Devon property. He was a member of the Carlton Club in London and Hurlingham Yacht Club and Royal Yacht Squadron of England.

The engine is theoretically capable of powering the A2 to a sustained Mach 5 throughout flight with an effective exhaust velocity of 40,900 m/s or specific impulse of 4170 s, SFC . \\"Results so far show the Mach 5 vehicle from Reaction Engines can avoid later technology pitfalls and could travel from Brussels to Sydney,\\" says ESA's LAPCAT project coordinator Johan Steelant. Mach eight vehicle Although the cruise flight of the scramjet based Mach eight vehicle seems feasible, the fuel consumption during acceleration requires a large fuel fraction, severely affecting gross take-off weight. Initial studies of a first-stage rocket ejector concept gave poor range with large take-off mass..

The arrows indicate the preferred flow of a population on the landscape. The red ball indicates a population that moves from an adaptive valley to the top of an adaptive peak. Under a strict regime of natural selection (which usually acts to increase fitness in a population), it is not possible for a population at peak A to reach peak B because this requires descending into an adaptive valley. Shifting balance theory aims to explain how this may be possible. The shifting balance theory is a theory of evolution proposed in 1932 by Sewall Wright, suggesting that adaptive evolution may proceed most quickly when a population divides into subpopulations with restricted gene flow. The name of the theory is borrowed from Wright's metaphor of fitness landscapes (evolutionary landscapes), attempting to explain how a population may move across an adaptive valley to a higher adaptive peak. According to the theory, this movement occurs in three steps: #Genetic drift allows a locally adapted subpopulation to move across an adaptive valley to the base of a higher adaptive peak. #Natural selection will move the subpopulation up the higher peak. #This new superiorly adapted subpopulation may then expand its range and outcompete or interbreed with other subpopulations, causing the spread of new adaptations and movement of the global population toward the new fitness peak. Although shifting balance theory has been influential in evolutionary biology, inspiring the theories of quantum evolution and punctuated equilibrium, little empirical evidence exists to support the shifting balance process as an important factor in evolution.

He became an engineer, working for the Metropolitan Board of Works. He was a close friend of Henry Austin, son-in-law of Charles Dickens. In 1849 he visited the North Devon town of Barnstaple to open an inquiry into the \\"sewage, drainage and supply of water and the sanitary conditions of the inhabitants\\". He died in 1879 as a result of developing diabetes. Shortly before his death his wife wrote to Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, an old friend, asking whether he had any knowledge of insulin which had recently been developed. Rammell is buried in an unmarked grave in Watford. Contrary to popular belief, he did not die in poverty. Career highs He might be called an \\"unsung hero\\" of railway history. He was responsible for the experimental pneumatic railway at Crystal Palace. The Crystal Palace atmospheric or pneumatic railway was built in 1864 at the lower end of the Crystal Palace Park, and was working for a matter of months. It ran for about 600 yards in a 10-ft diameter brick tunnel between the Sydenham and Penge gates to the Park. The tunnel had a gradient of one in 15 and the railway went round in a sharp curve. It had a coach which could seat 35, and a sliding door at each end. There was a remote steam engine coupled to a fan. The railway had a collar of bristles which made it airtight and enabled the coach to be sucked along - at a speed of probably 25 mph. The trip apparently cost sixpence.

The immediate environs of the castle is known as the Castle Park. The owners In 1545, the knight Prokop of Hejlovec built a Renaissance style manor house in the village of Mƒõ≈°ice (today, this area is an outlying district of T√°bor). During this time, the villages of Mƒõ≈°ice, ƒåekanice and Stoklasn√° Lhota all belonged to the Prokop family of Hejlovec. John Joseph Caretto, the Count of Mellisimo, rebuilt the manor house in 1699 as a Baroque Castle. In 1792, John Hannygar of Eberg built special water toilets in the Baroque Castle. These water toilets, still work today. In 1817, John Schmidgr√§ber of Lusteneg enlarged the building and, in the Empire style, installed an ostentatious staircase and recreated the facade of the castle. After 1877, the castle belonged to the N√°dhern√Ω family (barons) of Borut√≠n. Since 1997, the castle has been the property of Jan Berwid-Buquoy.

Hamas and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed that the attack by Riyashi was a joint operation mounted as a response to weeks of Israeli incursions into West Bank cities that had left about 25 Palestinians dead. Unlike most bombers, Riyashi came from a wealthy family. She was the eighth Palestinian female suicide bomber, but only the second to have left behind children. Riyashi was the first female suicide bomber sent by Hamas whose spiritual leader at the time, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin had initially objected to the involvement of women in such actions, altering this position shortly before his assassination by Israel in March 2004. She was the wife of a local Hamas commander and according to Israeli security sources she was involved in a extramarital affair with another Hamas commander from Gaza. Her suicide was planned by the two and it meant to clean her name and honor. Videotaped message Wearing combat fatigues and holding an automatic rifle with a rocket-propelled grenade in the foreground, Riyashi said that since age 13 she had dreamed of turning \\"my body into deadly shrapnel against the Zionists\\". She continued: \\"I always wanted to be the first woman to carry out a martyrdom operation, where parts of my body can fly all over ... God has given me two children. I love them [with] a kind of love that only God knows, but my love to meet God is stronger still.\\" The attack Riyashi detonated a 2 kg bomb inside a building where the thousands of Palestinians who cross each day from Gaza to work in a neighbouring industrial zone are processed. The Israeli army reported that when she reached the metal detector at the terminal, Riyashi pretended to be crippled and claimed to have metal plates in her leg which would sound the alarm. She asked to have a body search instead. After being taken to an area where a group of soldiers and policemen were checking bags, she was told to wait for a woman to come and search her in a cubicle. It was then that she detonated the explosive device. Two Israeli soldiers, a policeman and a civilian security worker were killed. Seven other Israelis and four Palestinians were injured.

Riyashi's relatives had no explanation for why a mother with children so young would choose to become a suicide bomber. At the time of Riyashi's death, her son Obedia was three years old, and her daughter Doha only 18 months old. Her brother-in-law, Yusuf Awad said, \\"I denounce her attack ... I support peace. We don't accept women doing such things. She has two children. It is not right.\\" Reaction among the Palestinian public Criticism of the operation in the Palestinian press was unprecedented. Hamas endured widespread criticism from among Palestinians, and even among some supporters, for deploying a young mother as a suicide bomber and for publishing photographs of Riyashi posing with her children and weapons. In one photograph, Riyashi's son is clutching what appears to be a mortar shell and is wearing a Hamas headband while another picture shows Riyashi gazing at her children. Hani Almasri, a Palestinian journalist at Al-Ayyam, told the Associated Press that Hamas' decision to release the photographs damaged the Palestinian cause and that Hamas would gain little advantage by these actions since in his opinion, there was less support from among the Palestinian people for military operations than had been the case previously. Hamas defended its decision to release the photographs stating that the pictures revealed the depth of the despair of Palestinian women and the depth of their desire to defeat the occupation. Sheikh Ahmad Yassin said that Riyashi's example would inspire more women to die in the fight against Israel, urging more to volunteer. Reaction in the Arab world * A 15 January editorial in the Egyptian government daily Al- Gumhuriya stated: > \\"The Gaza Shahida Reem Saleh Al-Riyashi, 21, yesterday provided new proof > that the Palestinian people stands fast in the face of the Israeli plans > that aspire to determine facts on the ground, to steal the Palestinian land, > and to surround it with an oppressive fence ...

Prior to the publication of A Lion Among Men, Maguire stated that \\"this book will be about the differing moralities... among soldiers, for one, and diplomats, for another... about decisions to wage war\\" and \\"One of the main characters is the Cowardly Lion\\".Interview, Akron Beacon Journal, October 2006. Maguire also stated that the novel's story \\"starts off about eight years after the end of Son of a Witch\\".Interview, March 2008. Maguire's website describes the novels as \\"seen now through the eyes of the Cowardly Lion‚Äîthe once tiny cub defended by Elphaba in Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\\" Synopsis The story opens with an impending battle between the Munchkinlanders and the Emerald City (EC) troops. In the middle of the warzone is the Mauntery which has been a haven for Elphaba, Yackle, Liir, and Candle. Yackle still lives despite losing her eyesight, and longs for death. At her request, the Maunts bury her in their crypt alive with only a few candles and some wine. She's eventually forgotten, but not by all. Elsewhere, a young woman wanders the Land of Oz until her path crosses \\"the dwarf\\", whom she calls Mr. Boss, the caretaker of the Clock of the Time Dragon. The Clock has awakened... Back at the Mauntery, Brrr, the Cowardly Lion, and his pet, a Glass Cat that he has nicknamed Shadowpuppet, arrive looking for Yackle. The Maunts claim she's deceased but Yackle rises from the crypt, still alive. Yackle and Brrr begin a game of wits ‚Äì Brrr demands information on Madame Morrible and in exchange he'll tell Yackle about himself. Brrr doesn't remember his parents or where he's from. He grew up by himself in the Great Gillikin Forest, learning language from the hunters that travel through his forest. One day he meets a soldier, Jemmsy, who's caught in his own hunting trap that was supposed to catch Animals. He implores Brrr to go to Tenniken and get help. Instead, out of fear and the naive belief that since this is the first person he's conversed with, then Jemmsy's a friend and can't be abandoned, Brrr stays with Jemmsy until he dies, claiming the books that lie beside him and taking Jemmsy's medal for courage to give to Jemmsy's relatives. Thus begins the Lion's unhappy personage as a coward. After Jemmsy dies, Brrr goes out to find Tenniken. Not long after he sets out, Brrr finds a terrified Bear Cub. The Bear soon reveals that his name's Cubbins, and takes Brrr to his family. They're the Northern Bears under rule by Queen Ursaless. She tells Brrr that to get to Tenniken, he must travel through the Cloud Swamp, a wet land inhabited by the Ozmists (ghost-like beings). Brrr and Cubbins have an \\"all but fatal\\" interview with the Ozmists. Brrr soon leaves Cubbins with the pile of books as he leaves the Great Gillikin Forest for the first time. When Brrr first ventures out of the forest, he finds out he isn't in Tenniken at all, but Traum, a market town east of Tenniken. Brrr soon finds himself involved in a massacre of Glikkun trolls. Not knowing what to do, Brrr tells some trolls to play dead, as he thinks that it's the only way to bypass the slaughter, but they take his advice too late and become captured. The people of Traum celebrate the Lion for refusing to help their enemies, the Glikkuns, and Brrr safely gets out of Traum by train. While on the train, however, Brrr decides that his refusal to help the Glikkuns is really a badge of shame, and knowing that in Tenniken his reputation will precede him, he ultimately can't bring himself to go there, instead arriving in the University town of Shiz. Brrr sets himself up in an apartment, and spends time in and around Shiz. The Lion soon finds a poem dedicated to humiliating him. Feeling embarrassed, Brrr packs up and leaves into the wilderness. Brrr wanders around the woods aimlessly for a while, until he finds a pride of Lions trying to make it in the forest. Brrr lives with the Lions for several years. But some of the Lions mock him, prompting him to leave... again. The next group that Brrr encounters is the Ghullim, a streak of Ivory Tigers in Wend Fallows. He'd happily pass right through their tribe without stopping, but they force him to stay with them for a while, if only to assess his status as a threat. While there, he befriends and ultimately falls in love with Muhlama H'aekeem, princess and heir to the Chieftaincy of the Ghullim. But when they're discovered mating by Ivory Tiger scouts, her father Chief Uyodor H'aekeem announces that he suspects him of attempting to thwart his regime due to Muhlama being seriously wounded from the lovemaking, once again prompting him to leave, before they have his head on a trophy background. Within the following weeks, Brrr meets a strange group of travelers. One a little girl named Dorothy, one a Scarecrow and the other was Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman. Brrr decides to go with them to meet the Wizard of Oz. They soon find themselves on a quest to kill Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. But Dorothy wants to reason with her instead. Once at Kiamo Ko, where Elphaba lives, she locks the Lion in a room with Liir while she and Dorothy have at it. They soon break out in time for Elphaba to be vanquished. The five go back to the Wizard and get their rewards. All but Brrr got what they wanted (Brrr getting a terribly manufactured Badge of Courage, even more so than Jemmsy's. Liir gets nothing for he was left outside.) Brrr promises Dorothy that he'll protect and look after Liir, but Liir vanishes in the streets and crowds of the Emerald City. Brrr then goes off on his own path, like before. The Lion has hit the outback again. With the other members of Dorothy's party laughing it up and having their own affairs, Brrr soon meets two old bachelors; Mister Mikko, an Ape, and Professor Lenx, a Boar of some kind. The three Animals discuss current events and past events. They soon rile Brrr up to retrieve money from the banks of Oz for them. The Lion soon becomes a broker for Animals, retrieving their money that is held in the banks since before they were forced to leave Oz. The forces of Oz soon discover that Brrr is bringing money into the Free State of Munchkinland and try him for being a Collaborationist. He strikes a plea and is assigned to go find the whereabouts of the Grimmerie, which leads him to his interview with Yackle. This recaps the first part of the book.

His maternal grandmother, Elena Lee Rush, was a great creative influence who taught him to sing, paint, and perform from a young age; he has said that \\"she has taught me everything I know\\". Also, while in elementary school, the glam metal band Bon Jovi was instrumental in forming his love of music. At the age of 15, Way was held at gunpoint. As he said in an April 2008 Rolling Stone interview, \\"I got held up with a .357 Magnum, had a gun pointed to my head and put on the floor, execution-style.\\" He went on to say that \\"no matter how ugly the world gets or how stupid it shows me it is, I always have faith [in it]\\". At age 16, he appeared on an episode of Sally Jesse Raphael to discuss the controversy surrounding the publicizing of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes in comic books.

Way originally wanted to be a guitarist. His grandmother bought him his first guitar at the age of eight, and he played in short-lived bands such as Ray Gun Jones and Nancy Drew with future bandmate Ray Toro. When he was not successful (one band kicked him out due to his lack of skill with the guitar), he chose to concentrate on his art career. Way was working as an intern for Cartoon Network in New York City during the September 11, 2001 attacks. Seeing the effects of the attacks first-hand prompted Way to change his views on life in the following weeks. He told Spin magazine, \\"I literally said to myself, 'Fuck art. I've gotta get out of the basement. I've gotta see the world. I've gotta make a difference.'\\" To help deal with the emotional effects the attacks had on him, Way wrote the lyrics to the song \\"Skylines and Turnstiles\\", which became the first song by My Chemical Romance.

In February and March 2015, Way performed as a solo artist with The Hormones on the main stage of the Australian 2015 Soundwave music festivals, and headlined an additional sideshow in Melbourne. In early 2015, it was announced that he would perform at the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. On Record Store Day 2016, Way released two exclusive, unreleased tracks from Hesitant Alien titled \\"Don't Try\\" and \\"Pinkish\\". 2018‚Äìpresent: Later solo singles On October 28, 2018, Way released his first major solo single in over two years, titled \\"Baby You‚Äôre a Haunted House\\". The single features Way's brother and former bandmate, Mikey Way, on bass. The official lyric video, featuring four skeleton-masked musicians performing the song, was released on YouTube on the same day. On November 15, Way released another single, \\"Getting Down the Germs\\", which was co-written with former bandmate Ray Toro. The single \\"gives a peek of where [Way] will be headed musically,\\" according to a statement released by Way. On December 14, Way released a third single, \\"Dasher\\", which features additional vocals from Lydia Night of The Regrettes. The single is a Christmas-themed story about a girl who falls in love with a reindeer as they await to be reunited after a long absence. On January 24, 2019, Way released a cover of \\"Hazy Shade of Winter\\" by Simon & Garfunkel, once again in collaboration with Toro. The song was featured in the trailer for the Netflix television series adaptation of Way's The Umbrella Academy, which was released the same day.

Gerard Way and The Hormones  As a solo artist, Way performs with a live band to provide additional instrumentation and vocals. Note: This is the most recent touring line-up in support of Hesitant Alien. * Gerard Way ‚Äì lead vocals, percussion * Ian Fowles ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals * Matt Gorney ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals * Jarrod Alexander ‚Äì drums, percussion * James Dewees ‚Äì keyboards, synthesizer, piano, backing vocals  Other musical collaborations  Gerard Way performing with My Chemical Romance in Edinburgh as part of the World Contamination Tour in 2010 In 2008, Way and musical project Julien-K remixed a version of the song \\"Sleep When I'm Dead\\" by The Cure for their EP Hypnagogic States. All profits gained from the sales of the EP go to funding the International Red Cross. In early 2009, Way and Japanese singer Kyosuke Himuro co-produced the new theme song for Advent Children Complete, the Blu-ray director's cut of the movie sequel to the popular video game franchise, Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. He is also credited with writing the lyrics, and singing alongside Himuro. The song, titled \\"Safe and Sound\\", was released on iTunes on April 29, 2009. \\"Safe and Sound\\" is only heard on the Japanese release of the film; the English release uses Himuro's \\"Calling\\" (the original ending theme for Advent Children) in place of it. He also contributed vocals for the vocal mix of the deadmau5 song \\"Professional Griefers\\". A longtime supporter of the British rock band LostAlone, Way is the executive producer of their second studio album I'm a UFO in This City (2012). Way contributed guest vocals to \\"Falling in Love Will Kill You\\" from Wrongchilde's debut solo album Gold Blooded, a pseudonym project from Kill Hannah frontman Mat Devine. In 2015, Way co-wrote and contributed backing vocals to the song \\"Louder Than Your Love\\" on Black Veil Brides frontman Andy Black's debut solo album The Shadow Side. Other ventures 1993‚Äìpresent: Writing Way's first attempt at writing a comic was at the age of 16 in 1993, writing a comic book series called On Raven's Wings, published by Hart D. Fisher's Bonyard Press. The series was cancelled after the second issue, however, due to the loss of its art team. Way was credited as Garry Way. Retrieved from Internet Archive 13 February 2014. In 2007, Way began writing the comic-book miniseries The Umbrella Academy. Way wrote the story and illustrated the original version, but cartoonist Gabriel B√° redrew the art in the first volume, Apocalypse Suite. Apocalypse Suite was first released by Dark Horse Comics in their Free Comic Book Day issue on May 5, 2007. Since then, an eight-page story has been published entitled \\"Safe & Sound\\", which appeared in a collection of stories entitled MySpace Dark Horse Presents Volume One. The first official issue of The Umbrella Academy was released on September 19, 2007. The first issue sold out and consequently there was a second printing released on October 17, 2007. Apocalypse Suite also won the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Limited Series. Retrieved from Internet Archive 13 February 2014. The next installment of the series, Dallas, was released on November 26, 2008, and, following speculation that Way had retired indefinitely from comics, a third installment entitled Hotel Oblivion was released in 2018‚Äì2019. Way and fellow artists Shaun Simon and Becky Cloonan co-created another comic-book series entitled The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, which Way announced at 2009 San Diego Comic-Con. At the 2012 New York Comic Con, the team announced that the first look at the series would be released on 2013's Free Comic Book Day. The series continued the concepts introduced in the My Chemical Romance album of a similar title. In 2011, My Chemical Romance stated that Mikey and Gerard were working on another comic book project which they had kept under wraps since mid-2009. As of 2015 nothing of this project has emerged. On December 21, 2013, Gerard Way stated that he and Gabriel B√° will be working on parts three and four of his comic book series Umbrella Academy beginning in the new year. In a podcast interview on December 31, 2013 with Chris Thompson from Pop Culture Hound, Way discussed his new Umbrella Academy series in more detail and confirmed he would do two volumes back-to-back, with a couple of flashback issues in- between. In addition, he discussed his new comic series All Ages which first appeared as a series of images on his Twitter feed. Although the project doesn't have a publisher or an artist at this stage, he is actively working on the story of cats in high-school who are discovering their place in the world. In 2014, it was announced that Way will be making his debut in the Marvel Universe by writing for the alternate universe Spider-Man series Edge of Spider-Verse. His story introduced Peni Parker, a Japanese-American student who pilots a bio-mechanical suit named SP//dr. 2001‚Äìpresent: Television Way promoting his comic book projects with DC Comics at the 2017 WonderCon In 2001, Way co-created a cartoon with Joe Boyle called The Breakfast Monkey. They pitched it to Cartoon Network, but the network declined to pick up the concept on the grounds that it was too similar to the existing property Aqua Teen Hunger Force. In 2013, Way made his television directorial debut on The Hub original series The Aquabats! Super Show!, co-directing and co-writing the season two finale \\"The AntiBats!\\" with series co-creators Christian Jacobs and Jason deVilliers. Additionally, Way's brother Mikey appears in the episode, playing the lead singer of a fictional death metal band called Asthma. The following year, the episode was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category for \\"Outstanding Writing in a Children's Series\\". In 2018, the character Peni Parker who he co-created appeared in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Since 2019, Way served as executive producer on the television series adaptation of The Umbrella Academy.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2007553/ Personal life Way in 2012 Way struggled with alcoholism and prescription drug addiction for many years but as of 2007 was maintaining sobriety. In a November 2010 issue of Spin magazine, he said that having become a happier person and feeling more in control, he had been able to enjoy the occasional recreational drink. On September 3, 2007, after a concert in Colorado, Way married Lyn-Z, bassist of Mindless Self Indulgence, backstage on the final date of the Projekt Revolution tour. A member of Live Nation's touring staff who was also an ordained minister performed the low-key ceremony. Their daughter, Bandit Lee Way, was born on May 27, 2009. They live in Los Angeles. In 2014, Way began openly discussing his gender identity struggles online and in interviews. In a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) hosted by Way in October 2014, he stated, \\"I have always been extremely sensitive to those that have gender identity issues as I feel like I have gone through it as well, if even on a smaller scale. I have always identified a fair amount with the female gender, and began at a certain point in MCR to express this through my look and performance style. So it's no surprise that all of my inspirations and style influences were pushing gender boundaries. Freddy [sic] Mercury, Bowie, Iggy, early glam, T-Rex. Masculinity to me has always made me feel like it wasn't right for me.\\" In January 2015, Way was featured in The Boyzine, an independent zine published by SWMRS frontman Cole Becker. Way again discussed his gender identity, commenting, \\"I never really subscribed to the archetype masculinity growing up, I had no interest in sports or anything like that. There was a time where I was called a girl so often that when I discovered the idea of transgenderism I considered myself to be more of a girl. So I identify with trans people and women a lot because I was a girl to a lot of people growing up.\\" In 2015, Way revealed on Reddit that he was a cousin of comedian Joe Rogan. In October 2019, Rogan confirmed it on his podcast. He also said that despite this, the two have never met.

It is situated in the south-west of the city and lies between Vilnius International Airport and the railway station. It has an eldership status. It has an Old Believers cemetery and a church. History Since the 19th century, the territory of Naujininkai was used as a cemetery. Naujininkai holds the only Old Believer cemetery in Vilnius. In 1825, two merchants bought a plot in Naujininkai and built a wooden meeting-house. In the 19th century, when steam energy started to spread, many factories in the suburbs of Vilnius built chimneys, because of that Naujininkai was called Kaminai (English: chimneys). The construction of the railway in Vilnius determined the growth of the neighborhood. Industry (most of which was associated with railways), warehouses and new residential buildings started to grow. Newcomers named many streets, such as ≈†altkalvi≈≥ (Metalworker), Konduktori≈≥ (Conductor) streets. Many of these names are still present in modern days. The houses in Naujininkai are diverse. There are Soviet-era multistory blocks, old wooden houses and other types of architecture.

He is the guitarist and vocalist of the indie rock trio Peter Bjorn and John. He is also a founding member of the Stockholm-based artist collective INGRID. He was born and raised in Mora and started his musical career playing the violin, which he soon changed to the guitar. His musical interest made him move to the town V√§ster√•s, where he entered a high school music programme at the Carlforsska gymnasiet and met Bj√∂rn Yttling. Marit Bergman also studied at the high school at the same time. In 1999, when Mor√©n was studying film science in Stockholm, he met John Eriksson at a party and they began discussing the comic Phantom and indie rock band Lilys. After the meeting, they started to jam together with Mor√©n's friend Bj√∂rn Yttling, which ended up in the creation of Peter Bjorn and John. During this period, Mor√©n had also joined The Plan, playing bass on their 2001 self-titled debut album. However, in 2002 he decided to leave the group to concentrate on Peter Bjorn and John's first record. Mor√©n has released four solo albums; in April 2008 he released a solo album in English, The Last Tycoon followed in 2010 by the Swedish- language I Sp√•ren Av T√•ren. His third solo album, Pyramiden, was released in late 2012 and is named after the ghost town of Pyramiden as well as referring to the pyramid as a tomb and to abstract concepts such as pyramid schemes. The album's first single, 'Odyss√©n', was released prior to the album with the b-side 'Vinstintressen'. A one-track digital download of the second single followed, the Swedish-language version of the song 'Say My Name', previously featured (sung in English) on the INGRID compilation album Volym 1. In early 2017 he released another solo album, 40, featuring multiple collaborations and covers. In 2019, he paired up with fellow Swedish pop songwriter David Shutrick to release the collaborative EP En √Öldrande Befolkning. Later that year, the duo recorded three more songs and re-released En √Öldrande Befolkning as a full-length album . The album features as its cover artwork an unattributed painting found at a flea market. Mor√©n is a member of Tutankamon together with Adam Olenius of Shout Out Louds, Daniel V√§rj√∂ of The Concretes, and Niklas Korsell who was the drummer of the Plan during Mor√©n's stint in the band. Since 2012, Mor√©n has begun to release a series of EPs featuring English translations and rewritings of his most popular Swedish-language songs, including 'Say My Name', 'Esther' and 'The Odyssey'. These EPs are named the 'Broken Swenglish' series.

Furthermore, it does contain the remote island of Bornholm. √òresund Region Map of the √òresund Region‚Äîsurrounding the √òresund strait which separates Zealand from Scania‚Äîextending as far east as Bornholm While actually a transnational region of co-operation, rather than a metropolitan area, the √òresund Region is by some considered to constitute the metropolitan area of Copenhagen. This goes back to the Initiativgruppen (a group tasked for developing the Copenhagen area in 1989), which was tasked with creating the metropole of the north. As of 1 October 2011 the √òresund Region is populated by 3,783,158 inhabitants with a density of 181.3/km¬≤ (469.5/sq mi) (Danish side: 2,531,945, Swedish side: 1,251,213). According to OECD, however, this region includes vast areas which are not recognized as part of the functional metropolitan area. Core of the √òresund Region Copenhagen is by far the largest city, and the obvious core of the region. However the √òresund Region covers large areas that are located remotely from both Copenhagen and the √òresund sea. Of which some has a rather low population density. Hence, a better area for comparacy with other regions, bi-lateral or national ones, is a lot narrower and includes the four Danish provinces Copenhagen by, Copenhagen omegn, Nordsj√¶lland and √òstsj√¶lland with a total area of only 2.768,6 square kilometres with 2,045,259 inhabitants as og 1.January 2019 And on the Swedish side the 17 Scanian municipalities that either has direct border to the √òresund Sea or borders to a such municipality. (Bjuv, Burl√∂v, Esl√∂v, Helsingborg, H√∂gan√§s, K√§vlinge, Landskrona, Lomma, Lund, Malm√∂, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Sval√∂v, Trelleborg, Vellinge, √Östorp and √Ñngelholm) These municipalities covers a total area of 3,387.5 square kilometres and had a population of 1,003,631 inhabitants by 1.January 2019 A total population of 2,931,445 living at an aggregate area of 5,969.9 km2, with a population density of 491.0 inhabitants per km2 of land. This is an illustration of the population and population density around the √òresund sea rather than a formal area. But as such the population around √òresund constitutes by far the largest population centre of Scandinavia and Finland. Copenhagen metropolitan area (within Denmark only) Copenhagen metropolitan area is most commonly recognized, and before 2007 official, equal to the Danish part of this \\"core\\". The four mentioned Danish provinces, with two million inhabitants at a land area of 2.768,6 km2 and a population density of 722 people per square kilometre. While the administrational Region Hovedstaden includes the remote Baltic Sea island Bornholm, but excludes important suburbs south-west and west of the city as well as the locally important towns K√∏ge and Roskilde which both are largely build together with the Danish capital through newer suburban areas. Political reasons Some Danish politicians simply do not want more than a third of the Danish Kingdom to be considered as parts of the capital, while remote areas on islands without fixed connections as well as parts of the windy North Sea coast get lower population figures. The 2007 regional and municipality reforms aimed to level figures out more evenly. Before 1970 there were 1098 Danish municipalities, between 1970 and 2006 this figure varied between 275 and 270. And by 2007 they were merged into 98, however Copenhagen has not been allowed to include any new land area since 1902, despite Frederiksberg with 100,000+ inhabitants, on an 8.8 km2 surface, ever since 1901 has been an enclave totally surrounded by Copenhagen. After 1902 Copenhagen municipality has only grown geographically through land reclamation. OECD OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) defines the Copenhagen metropolitan area with a population of 2,390,000 inhabitants as of 2009. According to OECD the Finger Plan doesn't include the entire functional/economic metropolitan area of Copenhagen. Other definitions The local TV stations TV2/Lorry, Kanal K√∏benhavn and Hovedstads-TV each also defines the Copenhagen metropolitan area as the area they respectively cover. They all fits well with the area which the four provinces (Copenhagen by, Copenhagen omegn, Nordsj√¶lland and √òstsj√¶lland) cover. (the provinces are based on European Union's so called NUTS 3 areas) The same area is used for the ticket fare system of all public transport within Greater Copenhagen and the Fingerplan area.

The fight resulted in many deaths; the area was later named Kunnamangalam. The victims were called Chathamangalam, and those who led the fight were called Padanilam. Another story behind Chathamangalam is related to the ancient temple of Chathamangalathappan. It is believed that this temple, which is related to the Guruvayur temple, had its stone laid by Naranathu Bhranthan. As the families of the sorcerers live here, it is called the place of Kuttichathan, or Chathamangalam. The market of Chathamangalam is Kattangal.

Character's background In late April 1998, Sara Cummings came to Sunset Beach. Her sister Meg Cummings had been living there already for a year and a half, and her parents Joan and Hank had just moved in, after their farm in Ludlow was destroyed. Sara had been on the run from the press. Last few months, she was an Intern to Congressman Blythe, a well-respected person, with whom she had an affair, and therefore, the press was trying to find her. Sara claimed she didn't have an affair with him, but eventually she confessed the truth. When she came to Sunset Beach, Sara found love in Casey Mitchum and when the story with Congressman Blythe was over, they continued their relationship, which ended in a few months. Sara was afraid of losing Casey forever because Casey was comforting her sister Meg, who had just left her ex-fianc√© Ben Evans. Then Sara made a pact with Tim Truman to break up the couple, but her plotting only drove Casey far away from her. Sara then decided to change her tactic. She had confronted Maria Torres about breaking up Meg and Ben, and she even had a fight with her.

In 1632, prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw gave the palace to his favourite, Adam Kazanowski; this caused a serious misunderstanding with the King, and a special Sejm committee was appointed to determine the circumstances behind this gesture. In 1637, Kazanowski enlarged the building, holding to Tencalla's original designs. The new structure was a large four-storied palace with a garden, enormous terrace and central courtyard‚Äîalcove tops were decorated with gilded crowns. The rich furnishings of the palace were described in 1646 by Jean Le Laboureur, a companion of the French Ambassador Extraordinaire to Poland, Madame de Gu√©briand. Le Laboureur was amazed by what he saw inside‚Äîa large statue of Bacchus made of pure silver sitting on a barrel with wheels (that served as a wine vessel during banquets), gilded wooden ceilings in the Venetian style, rooms filled with oil paintings, marble decorations, Flemish and oriental tapestries, oriental objects, furniture from Italy and Bavaria, silverware, a live bear inside a gilded cage in the courtyard, caged monkeyshttp://e-gazeta-warszawa.blogspot.com/2012/01/jak-to-onufry-zagoba-na- bednarskiej-z.html and a large collection of musical instruments belonging to Crown Court Marshal Kazanowski's private orchestra. Le Laboureur later wrote: > Italy, which we visited after leaving Poland has nothing as magnificent and > lordly. I admit that I was astonished, and it seemed that I had been > transferred to an enchanted palace. His patron Madame de Gu√©briand noted \\"the rooms [were] decorated with various cupboards of the most exquisite workmanship, and tables with the most beautiful objects in gold, silver and amber\\". Marshal Kazanowski, pleased with Madame de Gu√©briand delight at seeing the objects asked which items she would like to take back with her to France, and despite Madame's protests, he and his wife sent her several amber caskets. Remnants of the Kazanowski Palace, a decorative stone pinecone that once adorned the rooftop. Kazanowski also arranged a cabinet of curiosities (Wunderkammer) in his palace that contained a large stuffed snake from Africa hanging from the ceiling, and an Indian sea turtle. The palace also had a terrace garden on the escarp side, and was notably famous not only because of its decadent furnishings, but also due to central heating and plumbing installed inside. After Kazanowski's death the palace was passed on to his wife El≈ºbieta S≈Çuszczanka, who some time later married Hieronim Radziejowski. At the time, she was the wealthiest woman in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. After Radziejowski was found guilty of treason against the King, she filed for divorce, which caused a small private war in Warsaw between Radziejowski and the S≈Çuszka family who took the Kazanowski palace by force. Subsequently, Radziejowski was convicted and sentenced to the death penalty and had to escape the borders of the Commonwealth. The opulent Kazanowski Palace was ransacked and burned down during the Deluge by the Swedes in 1656 and never rebuilt.

He was born in Paris born, February 17, 1967, and lives in France. After a few drawing lessons taken at Herg√© from 1976 to 1978, in 1987 he had a formal training in the visual arts at the Gobelins School of the Image in Paris. In 1994, Claude Lefrancq, a Belgian comic publisher, asked Rosalind Hicks to publish Hercule Poirot's comic book, showing her the Blake and Mortimer's comic book, Mortimer versus Mortimer. In 1995, with the novelist Fran√ßois Rivi√®re, French Agatha Christie specialist, Miniac drew his first cartoon series, \\"Agatha Christie\\", published at Lefrancq publishing, in Edgar P. Jacobs's spirit, in schematic style. It was a success. After the publisher went bankrupt in 2000, EP publishers ( La Martini√®re group, Paris) published the comic books, the first one in October 2002 and the second one in February 2003. In four years, 20 000 copies of each have been sold in France ( At the end of 2006, 148 000 copies for all the books ). In July 2007, Death on the Nile and Murder on the Orient Express were released by Harper Collins UK as a comic strip, adapted by Fran√ßois Rivi√®re and illustrated by Solidor. These books will be published by Harper Collins in Australia the first November of this year. Also, one Jean-Fran√ßois Miniac's ancestor is Louis Duchesne, a French historian (Acad√©mie fran√ßaise). Marc Tanguy, Saint-Malo's marksman, another ancestor was one of the survivors of the French 74-gun ship Redoutable at Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. At present, Miniac is writing his story.

This is a general glossary of the terminology used in the sport of rugby union. Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics.   0-9  22 The 22 m line, marking from the tryline. 89 An \\"89\\" or eight-nine move is a phase following a scrum, in which the number 8 picks up the ball and transfers it to number 9 (scrum-half). 99 The \\"99\\" call was a policy of simultaneous retaliation by the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa, (the 99 comes from the British emergency services telephone number which is 999). The tour was marred by on-pitch violence, which the match officials did not adequately control and the relative absence of cameras compared to the modern game made citing and punishment after the fact unlikely. The Lions' captain, Willie John McBride (Ireland), therefore instigated a policy of \\"one in, all in\\" - that is, when one Lions player retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest Springbok. By doing so, the referee would be unable to identify any single instigator, and so would be left with the choice of sending off all or none of the team. In this respect, the \\"99\\" call was extremely successful - no Lions player was sent off during the tour. A Accidental offside see Offside Advantage \\"Advantage\\" is the period of time after an infringement in which the non-offending side have the opportunity to gain sufficient territory or tactical opportunity to negate the need to stop the game due to the infringement. The referee will signal advantage with his arm out horizontally toward the non-infringing team. If no tactical or territorial advantage is gained, the referee will whistle and give the decision that had been delayed. If sufficient advantage is gained, the referee will call \\"advantage over\\", and play will continue. The Advantage Law allows the game to flow more freely, and not stop for every minor infringement, giving no incentive for a player to commit \\"intentional\\" fouls. An example of the application of advantage would be if Team A knocked the ball on (technical offence, conceding a scrum) but a Team B player picked the ball up and made a run forwards before being tackled. Advantage line Also called the gain line. It is an imaginary line drawn across the centre of the pitch when there is a breakdown in open play, such as a ruck, maul or scrum. Advancing across the gain line represents a gain in territory. Alickadoo A non-player associated with a rugby game or club, especially a committee member or administrative official. May perform various off-field roles, particularly on a match day. Ankle tap An ankle-tap or tap- tackle is a form of tackle. It is used when the player carrying the ball is running at speed and a defending player is approaching from behind. Even if the defender is not able to get close enough to the ball-carrier to wrap his arms around him in a conventional tackle, he may still be able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble.  B  Ball back If the ball enters touch, then play is restarted by a line-out at the point where the ball left the field of play. The exception to this is if the ball is kicked into touch on the full. In this case, a line-out is taken at the point from where the ball was kicked, and not from where it entered touch. Ball back is waived in certain circumstances: * If the kicking player is inside his own 22m line when he receives and then kicks the ball. If the player receives the ball outside the 22 then retreats back into the 22 and kicks into touch on the full it is a lineout at the nearest point on the touchline from where the ball was kicked. * If a side elects to kick a penalty into touch. Bill Australian name given to the (William Webb Ellis) Webb Ellis Cup. Black dot A mark in the centre of the crossbar connecting the goal posts, usually black in colour, used as an aid to kickers with their aiming. A player scoring a try in the centre of the goal line, that is beneath the posts, can be said to have scored \\"under the black dot\\". Blindside The narrow side of the pitch in relation to a scrum or a breakdown in play; it is the opposite of openside. The blindside flanker is expected to cover the opposing team blindside at scrum and breakdown. The Blindside of the scrum is the side that the opposing scrum half is feeding the ball from. The Open side is the other side, 'Open' in this situation, means unimpeded. Blitz defence The blitz defence is a defensive technique similar to the defence used in rugby league. It relies on the whole defensive line moving forward towards their marked man as one, as soon as the ball leaves the base of a ruck or maul. The charge is usually led by the inside centre. The idea of this technique is to prevent the attacking team gaining any ground by tackling them behind the gain line and forcing interceptions and charged down kicks. However, the defending team can be vulnerable to chip kicks and any player breaking the defensive line will have much space to play because the defence are running the other way and must stop, turn and chase. Blood bin It is also called blood replacement. A player who has a visible bleeding injury may be replaced for up to fifteen minutes (running time, not game time), during which he or she may receive first-aid treatment to stop the flow of blood and dress the wound. The player may then return to the pitch to continue playing. Bonus points Bonus points are a method of deciding table points from a rugby union match. It was implemented in order to encourage attacking play throughout a match, to discourage repetitive goal-kicking, and to reward teams for \\"coming close\\" in losing efforts. *Under the standard system, 1 bonus point is awarded for scoring 4 (or more) tries and 1 bonus point for losing by 7 points (or fewer). *The French professional league replaces the four-try bonus point with a point for a win in which the winning team scores at least 3 more tries than its opponent. In addition, the \\"losing\\" bonus point requires a margin of defeat of 5 or fewer points. * Australia's National Rugby Championship uses the same system as France, except that a losing bonus point is awarded if the margin of defeat is 8 points or fewer. Box-kick This is a kick taken from behind a scrum, normally by the scrum-half, in which he turns away from the scrum facing the touchline, and kicks the ball back over the scrum into the clear \\"box\\" of space behind the opposition to allow his own team to chase through and regain the ball in undefended territory. Breakdown The breakdown is a colloquial term for the short period of open play immediately after a tackle and before and during the ensuing ruck. During this time teams compete for possession of the ball, initially with their hands and then using feet in the ruck. Most referees will call \\"ruck\\" or \\"hands away\\" as soon as the ruck is formed. Most infringements take place at the breakdown, owing to the greater variety of possible offences at a breakdown, for example handling in the ruck, killing the ball, offside at the ruck, and so on. C Caution A player who deliberately or repeatedly infringes the laws is cautioned, and shown a yellow card. A cautioned player is suspended from playing for ten minutes. Cavalry Charge Typically during a penalty kick or free kick, the attacking players form a line behind their kicker. When signaled, they charge forward. The kicker then tap-kicks the ball and passes to one of the players behind. This move is explicitly forbidden under 10.4(p) and the penalty is a penalty kick. Centre They are the players wearing shirts numbers 12 & 13\\\\. They are divided into inside and outside centre. The inside centre is also known as the second five-eighths in New Zealand. Charge-down When a player makes a defensive clearance kick, but it hits an opponent who has run towards him in an attempt to block it, it is known as a charge-down. These can be good try-scoring opportunities. Choke tackle Tackle in which the tackler tries to keep the ball carrier on his feet and push him backwards before taking him to the ground. This is harder to execute but gives the tackler's side a gain in territory. Cibi The cibi is a Fijian war dance performed by the Fiji national team before each of their international matches. Conversion If a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to \\"convert\\" it for two further points by kicking the ball between the posts and above the crossbar - that is, through the goal. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try, parallel to the touch-lines. So it is advantageous to score a try nearer to the posts as it is easier to convert it. The kick can be either a drop kick or a place kick in the 15-man game. However, in sevens, all conversions must be drop kicks. Counter rucking If a team (usually the team that took the ball into contact) has secured the ball at a ruck, and the other team manage to force them off the ball and secure possession themselves, the defending team are said to have \\"counter-rucked\\" Crash ball It is an attacking tactic where a player receives a pass at pace and runs directly at the opposition's defensive line. The crash ball runner attempts to commit two or more opposing players to the tackle, then attempts to make the ball available to teammates by off-loading in the tackle or recycling the ball quickly from the ruck. By committing players to the tackle, the crash ball runner creates holes in the opposition's defense, thereby creating attacking opportunities for teammates. Crash tackle Another name for the crash ball as mentioned above. Cross-Field Kick A kick which goes from one side of the field to the other and is kicked very high, usually resulting in an aerial battle between an attacker and defender to catch it. This is usually used near the defending team's try-line, often with the catch happening in the in-goal area itself. Most often used when the kicker knows the referee is playing advantage and his team will get a penalty if the kick fails - this is because the kick itself is very risky and likely to result in an interception. D Drift defence The drift defence is a defensive technique that forces the attacking side into an ever-shrinking pocket near to the touchline. It operates by the defensive side moving forward and diagonally following the path of the attacking side's ball movements. If used successfully the ball will usually end up in the attacking winger's hands near the line of touch. This player would then find themselves surrounded on one side by a defending outside centre, with the opposing winger opposite and the touchline on his other side. This will prevent a cut-back and allows the Touchline to act as a 16th player. Its disadvantage is that if the attacking team are strong enough to break through the pocket tackle the defending team will have no players spare to cover a breakout. Drop goal A drop goal is scored when a player kicks the ball from hand through the opposition's goal, but the ball must touch the ground between being dropped and kicked. It is worth three points. The team awarded a free kick cannot score a dropped goal until the ball next becomes dead, or until an opponent has played or touched it, or has tackled the ball carrier. This restriction applies also to a scrum taken instead of a free kick. Drop kick A drop kick is when a player kicks the ball from hand and the ball touches the ground between being dropped and kicked. If a drop kick goes through a goal then it results in a drop goal. Dummy pass An offensive ruse, where the ball carrier moves as if to pass the ball to a teammate, but then continues to run with the ball himself; the objective is to trick defenders into marking the would-be pass receiver, creating a gap for the ball carrier to run into. If it is successful, the player is said to have \\"sold the dummy\\". Dummy runner Another offensive tactic; a player on the attacking team runs towards the opposition as if running onto a pass, only for the ball to be passed to another player, carried on by the ball carrier or kicked forwards. As with a dummy pass, this tactic draws defenders away from the ball and creates space for the attacking team Dump tackle It is a tackling technique. The tackler wraps his arms around the ball carrier's thighs and lifts him a short distance in the air before forcibly driving him to the ground. The tackler must go to ground with the ball carrier for the tackle to be legal. This technique is useful to completely stop the opponent in his tracks. A dump tackle that drops the ball carrier on his head or neck is known as a spear tackle, and will almost invariably concede a penalty and possibly result in a caution for the tackler. In rugby union, World Rugby has ruled that a dangerous tackle of this type, sometimes also called a tip tackle, should be punished with a straight red card. E Eightman, Eighth-man Alternative name for the Number 8 F Five metre scrum, Scrum-five When a scrum offence is committed within 5 m of either try line, or in the in-goal area, the referee will award a scrum on the five metre line; this is to prevent all but the most brutal packs from driving the ball over the try line within the scrum. Fend or \\"hand off\\" Fending is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm. For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or \\"straight-arm smash\\", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play. First XV or First fifteen The preferred starting line-up of a team ‚Äì more colloquially, the senior team of any club. Flanker Also known as breakaways or wing forwards. They are the players wearing shirts numbers 6 & 7\\\\. They are the players with the fewest set responsibilities. The player should have all round attributes: speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills. Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the real ball winners at the breakdown, especially the number 7. The two flankers do not usually bind to the scrum in a fixed position. Instead, the openside flanker will attach to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the blindside flanker attaches himself to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline. Fly half or five-eighth Referred to by a number of different names, including first five-eighth in New Zealand, this player wears shirt number 10. They are the back-line player most likely to be passed the ball from the scrum-half or half-back, and therefore make many key tactical decisions during a game. Often this player is also the goal kicker as the position requires excellent kicking skills. Forward pass It is called a throw-forward in the laws of the game. A forward pass occurs when the ball fails to travel backwards in a pass. If the ball is not thrown or passed forward but it bounces forward after hitting a player or the ground, it is not a throw-forward. If the referee deems it accidental, this results in a scrum to the opposing team; however deliberate forward passes result in the award of a penalty. Foul play Foul play is defined as the deliberate infringement of the laws of the game. Fourth official A fourth official is one who controls replacements and substitutes. He may also substitute for referee or touch judge in case of injury to either of them. Free-kick Also called short arm penalty. This is a lesser form of the penalty, usually awarded to a team for a technical offence committed by the opposing side such as numbers at the line- out or time wasting at a scrum. A free kick is also awarded for calling a mark. A team cannot kick for goal and the normal 22m rule applies for kicking for position from a free kick. A Free Kick is signalled by the referee with a bent arm raised in the air. Full-back They are the player wearing jersey number 15. They act as the last line of defence against running attacks by the opposing three-quarter backs. The full-back is expected to field high kicks from the opposition, and reply with a superior kick or a counter-attack. The full back is sometimes the specialist goal-kicker in a team, taking penalty and conversion kicks. Full house Scoring a try, conversion, penalty and drop goal in the same match. G Gain line The gain line is an imaginary line drawn across the centre of the pitch when there is a breakdown in open play, such as a ruck, maul or scrum. Advancing across the gain line represents a gain in territory. Garryowen A Garryowen, or up-and-under kick, is a high short punt onto or behind the defending team. Goal A goal is scored when a player kicks the ball through the plane bounded by the two uprights and above the crossbar. A drop goal or penalty goal count for 3 points and conversions count for two. Goal from mark Goal from mark is an antiquated method of scoring. It occurred when a player \\"marked\\" and scored a goal from there. In the modern game, a goal cannot be scored from a free kick, but in the past the reward for scoring a \\"goal from mark\\" (which is a difficult kick to play) was three or four points. Occasionally referred to as a field goal. Goal line, Tryline Two solid, straight white lines (one at each end) stretching across the entire width of the pitch passing directly through the goal posts which defines the boundary between the \\"field of play\\" and the \\"in-goal\\". As the goal line is defined as part of the \\"in-goal\\", attacking players can score tries by placing the ball with downward pressure onto the goal line itself. The base of the goal posts and post protectors are also defined to be part of the goal line. The goal line is often referred to as the \\"try line\\" though that term does not appear in the Laws of the Game. Goose Step A goose step, made famous by Australian David Campese but now performed by many players, is a running technique where the player slows down and takes a small 'hop' into the air before sprinting off - sometimes in a different direction - upon landing. Its purpose is to confuse the defender, who is often unable to predict the sudden change of pace and direction. Group of death Is an informal sobriquet used to describe a situation that often occurs during the group stage of a tournament, where either (1) any team in the group could qualify and any team could be eliminated, or (2) more teams have a legitimate chance to advance to the next stage than allowed by the tournament structure. Typically, a group of death will see an unusual match-up of heavyweight sides, due to a quirk in the seeding system. Grubber kick It is a type of kick that makes the ball roll and tumble across the ground, producing irregular bounces making it hard for the defending team to pick up the ball without causing a knock-on. It gives the ball both high and low bounce and on occasions, the ball can sit up in a perfect catching position. H Half-back Can refer to either the scrum-half or fly-half, but in New Zealand is exclusively used to describe the scrum-half. Haka The haka is a traditional MƒÅori dance performed by New Zealand national teams, most famously the All Blacks, prior to international matches. It serves as a challenge to the opposing team. Hand-off Handing off (also called fend) is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm. For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or \\"straight-arm smash\\", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play. High tackle A high tackle (or head-high tackle) is a form of tackle where the tackler grasps the ball carrier above the line of the shoulders (most commonly around the neck or at the line of the chin and jaw). Executed violently or at speed, a high tackle is potentially dangerous, so are often not just sanctioned with a penalty, but also a yellow or red card. Hooker Hookers traditionally wear the number 2 shirt. The hooker is the player who is in the centre position of the front row of the scrum and who uses his/her feet to 'hook' the ball back. Due to the pressure put on the body by the scrum and the requirement to use both arms to bind to other players (and hence having no free arm to use to support or deflect bodyweight) it is considered to be one of the most dangerous positions to play. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs, partly because they are normally the shortest of the forwards, but more often because they are the most skillful of the forwards. Hospital pass Any pass that is made which has the inevitable, unavoidable consequence of the receiver being tackled. This is because the receiver has already been marked and the opposing player is bearing down on the receiver so rapidly that, as soon as the ball is caught, the opposing player smashes into the receiver. Generally made in times of panic or when there is no one else available, it is called the hospital pass because of the inevitability of a hard tackle. I Interception The gaining of possession by running forward from the defensive line and taking a pass meant for a member of the opposition. The result is similar to the result of a line break, and has a good chance of leading to a try. K Kick-off A coin is tossed and the winning captain either chooses which direction his team shall play, or elects to take the kick that starts the game. Both halves of the match are started with a drop kick from the centre-point of the halfway line. The kick must cross the opposition's 10-metre line, unless played by a member of the receiving team. The opposition are not allowed to encroach beyond the 10-metre line until the ball is kicked. If the ball does not travel 10 metres, goes straight into touch, or goes over the dead ball line at the end of the pitch, the opposing team may accept the kick, have the ball kicked off again, or have a scrum at the centre. After a score, the game is restarted from the same place under the same restrictions, with the conceding team drop-kicking the ball to the scoring team. However, in sevens, the scoring team kicks off. Kick tennis Style of play characterised by both teams repeatedly kicking from hand to the opposition, rather than running at the opposition and risking a turnover. So-called because the ball moves back and forth like in a tennis match. It is considered boring to watch and also referred to as aerial ping- pong. Knock-on Also called knock-forward. A knock-on occurs when the ball accidentally moves forward after coming into contact with the upper body of a player, and then touches either the ground or another player. It results in a scrum with the put-in to the opposition. If the ball is intentionally knocked forward it is deemed a deliberate knock-on; the opposition is rewarded with a penalty and the offending player is given a yellow card and sent to the sin bin. L Latcher/Latching on A latcher is a player who binds himself to the ballcarrier in open play in order to add his power and weight to an attempt to break the line and gain yards. If the defence is able to stop the ballcarrier and hold him up, a maul usually forms. However latching on does not automatically create a maul. Late tackle A late tackle is a tackle executed on a player who has already passed or kicked away the ball. As it is illegal to tackle a player who does not have the ball, late tackles are penalty offences (referees allow a short margin of error where the tackler was already committed to the tackle) and if severe or reckless may result in yellow or red Cards. If a late tackle occurs after a kick and a penalty is awarded, the non- offending team has the option of taking the penalty where the ball landed. Loose head The loose head prop is the player who takes the left hand position on the front row of the scrum. A loose head prop traditionally wears the number 1 shirt. As the loose head has considerable potential freedom of movement compared to other front row players, the loose head can attempt to play various illegal techniques to divert the push of the opposing pack and is often able to illegally interfere with the ball in the scrum using his free arm. Line break Action by which the player with the ball gets through the opponent's defensive line without being tackled. If there is insufficient cover, or the player has support, line breaks can often lead to tries. Line- out A minimum of two players line up parallel with each other one metre apart between the five-metre and 15-metre lines. Usually, the hooker of the team in possession throws the ball in while his opposite number [may] stand in between the touchline and the five-metre line. All players not involved in the lineout, except the receiver (usually the scrum-half) must retire 10 metres. The ball must be thrown in straight down the middle of the lineout and the hooker must not cross into the field of play while throwing in. If the throw is not straight then the throw is given to the opposition or a scrum awarded. Jumpers can be lifted by their teammates below the waist, but the opposition's jumpers must not be obstructed, barged or pulled down. Line-out code It is a coded piece of information, used to communicate intentions about a line-out within one team in a match without giving information away to the other team. The advantage in line-out comes from knowing in advance how the throw will be made. Line speed The speed with which a blitz defence closes down the opposing team. A high line speed will make it difficult for the opposition to cross the gain line. Lock Locks or second-row are the players wearing shirts number 4 & 5\\\\. Locks are very tall, athletic and have an excellent standing jump along with good strength. This makes them the primary targets at line-outs. They also make good ball carriers, bashing holes in the defence around the ruck and maul. They also have to push in the rucks and mauls. M Mark A mark is the place where the game will restart after a stoppage, such as where a scrum- offence or penalty offence occurred, or on the touchline where the ball went out of play (or where the ball was kicked in the case of ball-back). Marks are generally defined by the referee, or the touch judge when the ball leaves play by the touchline. Marks can also be defined by a defending player who executes a clean catch (catches the ball before it bounces or touches another player) of a ball kicked by an attacking player if the defender is standing within his/her own 22-metre zone or in-goal. To \\"call a mark\\", the player shouts \\"Mark!\\" as he/she catches the ball. The referee then awards that player a free kick which must be taken by that specific player. (If, for whatever reason, that player cannot take the kick, a scrum is awarded instead.) If the player is simply a poor kicker he/she is likely to take a 'Tap Kick' and immediately pass the ball to the fly-half or full back who will generally deliver a clearance kick. Marks can be called when the ball is cleanly caught following a kick by the opposition for any type of kick except a kick off or restart after a score. It is legal, though very unusual, to call a mark from a clean catch of a penalty kick. Maul When a ball carrier is held up (without being tackled) by both an opposing player and a player from his own team, a maul is then considered formed. The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the maul. Players can join in only from behind that teammate. Anyone who comes in from the sides will be penalised by the referee. Hands are allowed to be used in the maul. If either team deliberately collapses the maul then that side will be penalised by the referee. (Note that from August 1, 2008, the IRB is conducting a global trial of a modification of this Law which will allow players to deliberately collapse a maul providing the collapse is achieved by pulling from above the waist.) If the ball does not come out in a timely fashion, the referee will award a scrum to the team that did not take the ball into the maul. Mauls can only exist in the field of play. Play that looks like a maul can exist within the in-goal but restrictions on entry to the maul and the need to bind on to a team member do not apply. Medical joker A player signed by a professional club as an injury replacement. The term is directly borrowed from the French joker m√©dical and is most commonly associated with France's top league; that country has long allowed such signings. Mismatch Situation where a back is one-on-one with a forward. This favours the attacking side, as often forwards are too slow to stop backs, and backs are too small to stop forwards. Mulligrubber The mulligrubber kick is a style of kicking. A mulligrubber is directed towards the ground and forced to bounce. Often used in situations where either the ball needs to be placed in a specific position (i.e. on the try line) or to intentionally stop the opponent from being able to catch the ball on the full. N North (to go north, to head north, etc.) In the days prior to professionalism in rugby union, players would often convert to rugby league ‚Äî which was a paid sport ‚Äî thereby becoming ineligible to play rugby union again. In Wales and (to a lesser extent) England, the term \\"to go north\\" referred to this change of code, an allusion to the popularity of rugby league in the north of England. Not straight Referee's call when a line-out throw or the feeding of the ball into the scrum is unfairly towards the team in possession, preventing any contest for the ball. It is punished by resetting the set piece and giving control of the ball to the opposition. Number 8 They are the players wearing shirts number 8. It is the only position that is known only by the shirt number. Number eights must have a good tactical awareness in order to coordinate scrums and ruck moves with the scrum-half. If the ball is at his feet at the back of a scrum, ruck or maul, it is normally the number eight's decision whether to pass the ball out or drive the breakdown on in order to make ground. O Obstruction Offence whereby a player deliberately impedes an opponent who does not have the ball. Off-load pass (offload) A short pass made by a player being tackled before he reaches the ground, usually by turning to face a teammate and tossing the ball into the air for a teammate to catch. Offside A player is offside when he/she is forward of the relevant offside line i.e. between the relevant offside line and the opposing team's dead ball line. In a match, most players will be offside several times but they only become liable for penalty if they do not act to attempt to become onside (which generally means retreat downfield) or attempt to interfere with play. In open play, only the ball carrier's team (or the team that last carried or deliberately touched the ball) is bound by offside - the offside line for them is the ball. (Note every player who passes the ball backwards is offside and must attempt to retire.) An accidental offside may occur (and be penalised) if the ball carrier accidentally collides with one of his own team's players while that player is attempting to retire behind the ball (or is otherwise in an offside position). Onside A player is onside whenever he or she is behind the relevant offside line for the particular phase of play. Players who are onside take an active part in playing the game. Previously offside players may be \\"put onside\\" by the actions of other players (for example, in a kick ahead in open play, players in the kicker's team in front of the kick are offside but can be put onside by the kicker or any other team member who was onside at the time of the kick running up the pitch past them). So that players can be confident they are now onside and can take an active part in the game, the referee may shout \\"Onside\\" or \\"All Onside\\". On the full If the ball is kicked into touch without first bouncing inside the field of play it is termed as ball is kicked into touch on the full. The line-out is then taken from where the ball was kicked, except in situations where it was kicked from inside the 22. Openside The broad side of the pitch in relation to a scrum or a breakdown in play. The openside flanker is expected to cover the opposing team openside at scrum and breakdown. It is the opposite of blindside. Overlap Situation where there are more attacking players (typically backs) on one side of the field than there are defending players. An overlap can be used to manufacture a try by forcing the defenders into tackles and offloading to teammates until the defenders have run out. P Pack The pack is another name used for the forwards players, particularly when they are bound for a scrum. Passing A pass is to transfer a ball to a teammate by throwing it. Passes in rugby must not travel forwards. There are different varieties of pass, including the flat, direct spin pass; the short, close-quarters pop pass; and the floated pass - a long pass which an advancing player can run onto at pace. Penalty Penalties are awarded for serious infringements like dangerous play, offside and handling the ball on the ground in a ruck. Penalties are signalled by the referee with a straight arm raised in the air. Players can also receive red and yellow cards, as in Association football. The offending team must retire 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer) for both penalties and free kicks. A team can either kick for goal, tap and run the ball, take a scrum or kick directly into touch with the resulting line-out awarded to them. Penalty kick If a side commits a penalty infringement the opposition can take the option of a place kick at goal from where the infringement occurred (or, if the offence occurred when a player was in the process of kicking the ball, the non- offending team can opt to take the kick from where the ball landed which may be more advantageous). This is called a penalty kick. If successful, it is worth three points. Penalty try A penalty try awarded if the referee believes a team illegally prevented a try from probably being scored. As of 2018, penalty tries score an immediate seven points, with no conversion having to be taken. Generally a penalty try is awarded when the try-preventing offence cannot be easily attributed to a single individual, such as when a team repeatedly deliberately collapses a scrum near its own tryline. When the prevention of the try is due to an individual, a yellow card is a more common punishment. Phase A phase is the time a ball is in play between breakdowns. For example, first phase would be winning the ball at the lineout and passing to a centre who is tackled. Second phase would be winning the ball back from the ensuing breakdown and attacking again. Pitch The official name of a rugby playing field. Dimensions are 100 m long by 70 m wide. Place kick The place kick is a kicking style commonly used when kicking for goal. It typically involves placing the ball on the ground. To keep the ball in position, a mound of sand or plastic tee is sometimes used. Pop pass A very short pass. Professional foul A professional foul is a deliberate act of foul play, usually to prevent an opponent scoring. It is punishable by a yellow card. Prop They are the players wearing shirts number 1 & 3\\\\. The role of both the props is to support the hooker in the scrum and to provide support for the jumpers in the line-out. The props provide the main power in the push forward in the scrum. For this reason they need to be exceptionally big and strong. R Red card In International matches, red cards are shown by the referee to players who have been ordered off the pitch, which results in the player being removed from the game without being replaced. This usually occurs when a player is guilty of serious foul play, or violent conduct or for committing two offences resulting in cautions (yellow cards). Red cards are also commonly used in non-international matches in precisely the same manner as in International matches but there is no regulation requiring their use. (i.e. in a domestic match, a referee may dismiss a player without actually displaying a red card.) Red zone This is a term most commonly used by coaches to describe the area of the pitch between the try line and around 22 metres out, in which it is most likely a try may be scored or conceded. Restart The kick taken from the centre line after the opposition have scored points. Round the corner kicking A style of place-kicking in which the kicker, instead of facing directly toward the goal-posts, approaches the ball from an angle and swings his kicking leg in an arc. It was first credited to Wilf Wooler in the 1930s. Ruck A ruck is formed when the ball is on the ground and two opposing players meet over the ball. The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the ruck and players compete for the ball by attempting to drive one another from the area and to 'ruck' the ball backwards with their feet. Rucks commonly form soon after tackles, but can form anywhere in the field of play where the ball is on the ground. Handling the ball while it is in the vicinity of a ruck is a penalty offence. (Though modern practice allows a player on the ground to support the ball with his/her hands and for the player who is acting as scrum half to 'dig' for the ball once possession has been secured.) If the ball remains contested and does not come out of a ruck after about five seconds, the referee will award a scrum to the team he considers to have been moving forward in the ruck. S Scrum between ASM Clermont- Auvergne and Saracens. Scrum The eight forwards from each team bind together and push against each other. The scrum-half from the team that has been awarded possession feeds the ball into the centre of the scrum from the side most advantageous for his hooker (which is typically the side of loose head prop). The ball must be fed straight down the middle of the tunnel and the hookers must not contest for the ball until it is put in. If they do, a free- kick is awarded for \\"foot up\\". The scrum is taken again if the ball comes straight out of the tunnel or if it collapses. If the scrum wheels (rotates) due to pushing more than 90 degrees the scrum is reformed and awarded to the other side. Pulling in an attempt to unbalance the other side or to assist in rotating the scrum is a Penalty Offence. Scrum half Also known as a half-back (especially in New Zealand), they are the players traditionally wearing shirt number 9. Scrum halves form the all-important link between the forwards and the backs. They are relatively small but with a high degree of vision, the ability to react to situations very quickly, and good handling skills. They are often the first tackler in defence and are behind every scrum, maul or ruck to get the ball out and maintain movement. They put the ball into the scrum and collect it afterwards. Scrum halves generally also act as \\"receiver\\" in the line-out to catch the ball knocked down by the forwards. (The receiver is a member of the line-out and so stands within 10 metres of it and may join the line once the ball is thrown.) Selector A person who is delegated with the task of choosing players for a team. Typically the term is used in the context of team selection for a national, county, state or provincial representative side, where the selector, or \\"selection panel\\", act under the authority of the relevant national or provincial administrative body. Set piece Collective term for the scrum, line-out and sometimes the restart. Shoeing At the breakdown a ruck commonly forms over the players involved in the tackle. Where players who are on the ground on the opposition side of the ruck do not move away quickly enough, players on their feet may be tempted to \\"help\\" them move by pushing them away with their boots. This potentially dangerous act is illegal and if done deliberately (or recklessly) may result in penalties and yellow or red cards. Short arm penalty See free kick Sin bin The notional area where a player must remain for a minimum of ten minutes after being shown a yellow card. In high level games, the sin bin is monitored by the fourth official. Sipi Tau Sipi Tau is a Tongan war dance performed by the Tonga national team before each of their international matches. Siva Tau Siva Tau is a Samoan war dance performed by the Samoa national team before each of their international matches. Spear tackle A spear tackle is a dangerous tackle in which a player is picked up by the tackler and turned so that they are upside down. The tackler then drops or drives the player into the ground often head, neck or shoulder first. Spear tackles are particularly dangerous and have caused serious injury, including spinal damage, dislocations and broken bones in the shoulder or neck. On rare occasion, even death can occur. Spear tackles are taken very seriously by the various Union disciplinary committees and can result in lengthy playing bans. Stellenbosch Laws The Stellenbosch Laws were a set of experimental laws of rugby union considered by World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), from 2006 to 2008. The trials ended in late 2008, with the IRB choosing to adopt roughly half of the proposed changes. T Tackle during a game between the Stade toulousain and Aviron Bayonnais. Tackle A tackle takes place when one or more opposition players [tackler(s)] grasp onto the ball carrier and succeed in bringing/pulling him/her to ground and holding them there. Once briefly held, the tackler(s) must release the tackled player who must then him/herself immediately release or attempt to pass the ball so that play can continue. Tap kick A tap kick is a type of kick used by players at penalties or free kicks to meet the regulation that requires the ball must be kicked a visible distance before a player may pass or run with it. In a tap kick, the player momentarily releases the ball from his hands and taps it with his foot or lower leg and then quickly catches it again. The player will then generally try to run forward with the ball. Tap-tackle Despite its name, a tap tackle is a not actually a tackle as the ball carrier is brought to ground by a form of trip, is not actually held on the ground and may attempt to get up and continue to run. A tap tackle is used when a defending player is unable to get close enough to the ball carrier but is able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble. At speed, this will often be sufficient to bring the ball-carrier down, allowing a teammate of the tackling player to retrieve the ball or provide sufficient delay for the defending team to organise a defence. Ten Metre Law The Ten Metre Law is a form of offside which is designed to prevent injury to a defending player who attempts to catch a ball that has been kicked ahead by the attacking side. In the normal Law of Offside in open play, it is possible for an offside player to be put onside by actions of the opposing team. This ability to be put onside by a member of the opposing team does not apply if the offside player was within 10 metres along the field of a defending player waiting to catch the ball and the offside player remains offside until either he/she retreats onside or is put onside by a member of their own team. Test match International rugby union matches with full (Test) status are called Test matches. Tight Head The tight head prop is the player who takes the right-hand position on the front row of the scrum. A tight head prop traditionally wears the number 3 shirt. He is named the tight head since in the scrum he will have an opposition player bind to both his left- and right-hand sides, meaning his head is unexposed to the side of the scrum, as opposed to the loose head, whose left-hand side is exposed. TMO Television match official (TMO), commonly called the video referee. Touch Touch is the area outside and including the two touch-lines which define the sides of the playing area. As the touch-lines are not part of the playing area they are part of touch. The ball, and players carrying the ball, are not considered to be in touch until they touch the floor. Touch judge. Touch judge The touch judge is an official who monitors the touch-line and raises a flag if the ball (or player carrying it) goes into touch. Touch judges also stand behind the posts to confirm that a goal has been scored following a penalty kick or conversion of a try. Truck and trailer A colloquial term for an accidental obstruction. \\"Truck and trailer\\" occurs when a player carrying the ball leaves a maul, along with one or more of his teammates. Once the ball carrier leaves the maul, the maul is over, and if the ball carrier's teammates are in front of the ball carrier and prevent defending players from making a tackle, the defending team will be awarded a scrum. If the incident of truck and trailer is judged to be deliberate or the latest in a series of similar infringements, a penalty may be awarded instead. Try during a game between Newport Gwent Dragons and Leinster in the Magners League Try This is the primary method of scoring. A try is worth five points. It is scored when a player places the ball on the ground with downward pressure in the in-goal area between (and including) the goal-line and up to but not including dead ball line of the opposition's half. (As the goal posts and post protectors are also part of the goal-line, touching the ball down against the base of these is also a try.) There is no such thing as an \\"own try\\". If you touch the ball down in your own in-goal area, it results in a twenty-two metre drop out or a five-metre scrum. Tunnel When a scrum is formed, the gap between the legs of the three players from each team who form the 'front row' is called the 'tunnel'. Turnover When a team concedes possession of the ball, particularly at the breakdown, they are said to have turned the ball over to the other team. This can happen due to defending players stealing the ball from an isolated attacker, counter rucking, a knock on, an intercepted pass or the ball not emerging from a maul (wherein the referee awards the scrum feed to the opposing team). Twenty two metre drop-out A drop kick is taken from behind the 22m line if a team touches down in its own in-goal area but did not carry the ball over the try line, or if the ball is kicked over the dead ball line from any other play other than the kick-off. The ball only needs to cross the line, but if it goes directly into touch a scrum is awarded to the receiving team at the centre-point of the 22m line. U Uncontested scrum Scrum in which, due to absence of key specialist forwards through injuries or yellow cards, the safety of the scrum cannot be guaranteed. In an uncontested scrum, the players form a scrum but the two teams do not push against each other or compete for possession. Up and under An up and under, or a Garryowen kick, is a high, short punt onto or behind the defending team. Use it or lose it If a maul stops moving forward the referee will often shout \\"use it or lose it\\" to the team in possession of the ball. This means they must pass the ball within a five-second time period. If they do not, the referee will call a scrum and the team not in possession at the beginning of the maul will be given the feed. V Video Referee Also called TMO (Television Match Official). This is the official who monitors the match in television recorded matches. He is the person who could be called upon by the referee if he is unaware of the outcome of a rugby situation. A good example is a try that is obscured from view i.e. under numerous players. W Wheeling A scrum that has rotated through 90 degrees or more is said to have \\"wheeled\\". The referee will order the scrum to be reset, with the ball being turned over if the attacking team is deemed to have been deliberately or repeatedly wheeling the scrum. Wing The players wearing shirts numbers 11 and 14 are the left and right wingers. Wingers must be fast runners and agile in order to evade tackles and have excellent ball-handling skills in order to pass and receive the ball at pace. Y Yellow Card In International matches, a yellow card is shown to a player who has been cautioned to indicate \\"temporary suspension\\" for repeated or deliberate infringements of the rules. The offending player is sent to the ‚Äúsin bin‚Äù for at least 10 minutes while his team must play a man short. A player who is temporarily suspended cannot return to the pitch until the first break in play after his/her 10-minute suspension is completed. In domestic matches, yellow cards are commonly used in exactly the same manner as in International matches but this is not required by regulation so a referee may order the temporary suspension of a player without showing a yellow card.

She served as president of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA), the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and the Bloomsbury branch of the Women's Liberal Association. She first took part in public affairs on the occasion of the great bazaar in May 1845 at the Covent Garden Theatre, when ¬£25,000 was raised to further the anti-Corn Laws agitation, and she afterwards aided her husband in his various public projects. In 1870, she visited the United States, when she began to take a deepened interest in temperance reform and the women's suffrage question. She subsequently engaged in the work of the Association for the Abolition of State Regulation of Vice, and became president of the British Women's Temperance Association, of which she was one of the chief founders. Her annual addresses were always marked with deep earnestness. She paid a second visit to the U.S. in 1886, in order to attend a convention at Minneapolis as president of the World's WCTU. Early life and education Margaret Bright was born on 14 July 1818 at Rochdale, Lancashire. Her father was Jacob Bright (1775‚Äì1851), member of the Society of Friends, and a cotton mill proprietor; and her mother, his second wife, Martha Wood (1788‚Äì1830). A member of a well known Quaker family, several of her ten siblings, including John Bright, Priscilla Bright McLaren and Jacob Bright, became prominent in politics, activism and reform. Educated by the Society of Friends, she commented: ‚ÄòI developed slowly for we were strictly brought up and told that \\"children should be seen and not heard\\"'. Career Margaret married Samuel Lucas (1811‚Äì1865), a cousin, on 6 September 1839. Samuel, a fellow Quaker, was a London corn exchange merchant. The couple went to Manchester in 1845, when Samuel became involved in a cotton mill. The family moved back to London in 1850. Lucas became interested in politics during the anti-corn law protests in 1845. She aided her husband with the organisation of meetings and the raising of finances. Until her husband's death in 1865, however, her main burdens remained within the family, including the rearing of her two children, Samuel, a deaf mute, and Katharine. By 1870, both children had married, Katharine to John Pennington Thomasson (later MP for Bolton). Early political activism Relieved from her family duties, Lucas was free to seek a clear plan to fit her Quaker moral ambitions. In 1870, suffering from a chest infection, and feeling she needed a change of climate, she travelled to Halifax, Nova Scotia to visit a cousin, Esther Blakey. Lucas easily mixed in the trans-Atlantic reform society that included strong Quaker involvement. Many suffragists and temperance reformers in the northeastern United States welcomed her as 'John Bright's sister'. She would later reciprocate the same level of hospitality when American reformers came to Britain. The U.S. visit was a focal point in Lucas' public temperance career. There, she was able to experience 'the advanced views and institutions of a less trammelled social system', influences she found 'congenial'. Having signed the temperance pledge at the age of sixteen, she joined the American Independent Order of Good Templars in 1872, and became a grand worthy vice-templar in 1874. The Good Templars organised the British tour of 'Mother' Eliza Stewart, whose participation in the protests against saloons in the Women's Crusade led to the creation of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1874. Temperance and suffrage Margaret B. Lucas (1888) Lucas and Thompson spoke at a meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1876 which stimulated the founding of the BWTA and the White Ribbon Association. Lucas was elected BWTA president, in 1878, but she also supported peace and anti-prostitution work, and served on the executive committees of the National Society for Women's Suffrage and the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Her main concern being temperance, she remained BWTA president until her death. In 1885, American WCTU leader Frances Willard selected Lucas as first president of the World's WCTU. This emphasised the organisation's global commitment. Consequently, Lucas crossed the Atlantic again in 1886 to attend the WCTU convention in Minneapolis, at which she was warmly received. Lucas embodied the phase of women's temperance that saw the movement's power as being primarily in the home and in the superiority of women's moral virtues. In her fourth annual report she commented: ‚ÄòI believe (that) in the household, women have a greater power over men, than men have over women, in inducing abstinence from intoxicating drinks‚Äô. During the 1870s, she also made increasingly conservative assessments of the reality of the British position regarding social protest. British women would not, Lucas believed, emulate the American crusade marches. ‚ÄòIt is hardly likely we can go through the streets and kneel at the doors of the gin palaces‚Äô, she reasoned, but temperance women in Britain could hold processions and assemblies. They could also lobby, and in 1879, she presented the first women's petition in favour of Sunday closing to the House of Commons. By 1883‚Äì4, it was becoming clear that the general failure to convert men to temperance required a more radical conclusion: ‚ÄòThe conviction grows upon me that while Petitions educate the workers and the people something more is needed to make them effectual‚Äô. Had not ‚Äòthe time come‚Äô, she wondered, ‚Äòwhen it becomes a duty to claim the right to vote on the side of Temperance?‚Äô. In spite of this, the BWTA remained only one of several women's temperance organisations, and it did not enter its major period of expansion until after her death. As president of the Bloomsbury branch of the Women's Liberal Association, she lost no opportunity in all her public addresses of emphasizing the fact that temperance legislation, to be successful, required woman's vote. Death Margaret Bright Lucas Lucas died from tuberculosis on 4 February 1890 at her London home, 7 Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury, and was buried in Highgate cemetery with her husband. Friends and colleagues described Lucas variously as a 'homely British matron', 'well-preserved, erect and vigorous', an 'earnest speaker', and 'tall and stately'. She had an impressive shock of silvery hair into her sixties. The BWTA achieved greater success under her successor, Lady Henry Somerset, but ultimately, British temperance was destined to achieve less than its American counterpart. Lucas was, however, an important link in the Anglo-American women's reform networks as well as being a pioneer in British women's temperance. In 2007, Margaret and Samuel Lucas' graves were given listed status by the English Heritage in honor of their work in the anti-slavery movement.

The festival was founded in 1985 by Sheldon Wilner and Dick Finkel with the intention of bringing the art of street performance to Edmonton‚Äôs downtown region. Every year, the festival brings in performers from around the world, and gives an opportunity for local performers to showcase their talent. In 2014, the festival featured roughly 1500 performances, and was attended by 250,000 people. Over the years, StreetFest has hosted a wide variety of performers, such as famous high-wire artist Phillip Petite, Cirque du Soleil clown Michael Hancock, and a variety of other clowns, acrobats, jugglers and magicians. The festival is somewhat unique in that the majority of the income that the artists receive for their work during the festival comes not from the festival organizers, but from the goodwill of the audience. Hats are passed around after each performance, and audience members are encouraged, but not required, to tip the performer for their work. In addition to traditional outdoor shows, the festival is also known for its encouragement of artistic collaboration. The \\"Troupe de Jour\\" program brings select artists together every night during the festival for an original variety show that combines the unique talents of the performers involved. \\"Late Night Madness\\" is a festival- wide night of collaboration where individual artists are invited to work together to come up with their own show. \\"Be Your Own Busker\\" is an educational series aimed at teaching both children and adults some of the basics of street performance, like juggling and making balloon animals.  History  From 1981 to 1985, Edmonton International Street Performers Festival founders Sheldon Wilner and Dick Finkel ran an initiative called \\"Summerfest\\", which was a loose collection of summer cultural events that aimed to make summers in Edmonton more interesting. Many of Edmonton's present-day festivals can trace their roots back to Summerfest, including the Edmonton International Street Performers Festival. In 1985, the festival's inaugural year, there were 20 artists spread across Edmonton's downtown region. It was the first attempt at such a festival in Canada. While attendance wasn't high, this first festival sparked a great deal of interest in the community, and it was decided that the festival would continue into the next year. Wilner left the following year in 1986, but Finkel stayed on as the festival's producer, a role he would hold until 1999. In 1987, StreetFest centralized and hosted all of its artists in Sir Winston Churchill Square, where the festival is still held today. This proved fruitful, as it brought the visiting artists into closer proximity to one another, and the next year, in 1988, many of the performers got together to throw an impromptu variety show called \\"Late Night Madness,\\" a tradition that has continued ever since.

Oddie also wrote and sang the theme tune. The series began on 8 July 1978, running through the summer and continuing up to December, with a Christmas Special. According to a TV Times interview with presenter Bill Oddie when the show was aired, it was to have been named The Saturday Bonanza, but was renamed due to poor handwriting being mis-read. The Saturday Banana was shown by several ITV stations including Anglia, Border, HTV, LWT, STV, Southern, Westward and Yorkshire. For its first run, the series was available to ITV companies at the same time as the popular Tiswas, so whether the viewer saw Tiswas or The Saturday Banana was up to their regional ITV station. For the series's second run in 1979, only Southern and Anglia broadcast the show while most other regions screened Tiswas. As was a common practice within television at that time, the policy of Southern TV was to wipe any videotape recording of contemporary non-news programming, due to the high cost of videotape. Children's shows were often wiped as it was thought they would have little future value so consequently little remains of The Saturday Banana on broadcast quality master tape. However, the final episode before Christmas, 1979 remains in its entirety along with a sequence from 1978 which features Bill talking to George Chakiris, a discussion of fruitbats, some snake and toad sequences and presenter Bill Gamon briefly chatting to then-chart toppers Darts. A 'chart rundown' is also shown, with clips of the top ten played while the camera pans over the young audience members. A second edition exists in the Wessex Film Archive, in mediocre quality, copied from a domestic video recording. The robot Metal Mickey first appeared on The Saturday Banana and went on to star in his own sitcom on London Weekend Television from 1980 to 1983. Bill Oddie returned to The Goodies. Features The programme was broadcast live from Southern Television's Northam, Southampton studios, with occasional film inserts. The show took over from Our Show, another Saturday morning kids' programme, and Susan Tully, one of the young hosts of Our Show, came with it. Presenters wore bright yellow T-shirts with the Banana logo, and metal circular badges, firstly on yellow backdrops, then mass-produced on red backdrops, were issued to both guests and the child audience chosen from local schools. For the programme, Southern Television built a giant yellow, peeled banana, which they placed in front of their studios, and which often featured in opening titles and in the background of any item where the cameras were taken outside the building. Around six opening title sequences were pre- recorded, backed by Oddie's theme song, including a one-off Christmas Special sequence. Items featured on the show included a weekly chart rundown, with guest pop groups miming their latest hits, then being interviewed after being forced to slide down half of the main interior set. Children could also write- in with their 'dream activities', which show researchers would attempt to grant. One such feature saw Bill Oddie wrestle a small child in a side-sealed square filled with a foot of mud-coloured 'gunge'. The Saturday Banana featured a version of the children's television game show Runaround, made famous by comedian host Mike Reid but for The Saturday Banana's edition, one of the programme researchers who doubled as a presenter, Bill Gamon, hosted the madcap quiz. On one show, West Side Story star George Chakiris, then starring in 'Passion of Dracula' in a London production at the Queen's Theatre, opened the show by being driven, in a horse-drawn hearse, across Northam Bridge (by the studios), bringing startled drivers to a virtual halt. The opening programme featured a steam train on the railway siding that ran through the car park. The locomotive was Bonnie Prince Charlie borrowed from the Great Western Society at Didcot.

The western terminus is at PA 502 in Spring Brook Township. The eastern terminus is at PA 590 in Salem Township. The route is a two-lane undivided road running through rural and some developed areas southeast of Scranton. From the western terminus, the route crosses PA 307 and has a partial interchange with Interstate 380 (I-380) before reaching Moscow, where it forms a brief concurrency with PA 435\\\\. From Moscow, PA 690 continues northeast to its terminus at PA 590 in Hollisterville. PA 690 was designated in 1928 between U.S. Route 611 (US 611, now PA 435) in Moscow and PA 590 in Hollisterville. The route was extended west to PA 502 in the 1930s. Route description PA 690 begins at an intersection with PA 502 in the Spring Brook hamlet section of Spring Brook Township just north of the Watres Reservoir. PA 690 heads northward from PA 502, passing some local residents and nearby Benjamin Pond before beginning to wind through the woodlands north of the hamlet. After the intersection with Thomas Road, the highway progresses eastward for a short distance, turning northeastward into a small resident segment near Maple Lake. After intersecting with Maple Lake Road, PA 690 turns eastward into the hamlet of Maple Lake. The hamlet is residential, as the road becomes the main street, intersecting with PA 307\\\\. There, PA 690 turns northward out of Maple Lake, winding into Exit 22 of I-380 (a southbound only exit). After I-380, PA 690 makes a short curve to the northeast before entering Moscow, where it gains the name of Church Street. PA 690 heading eastward through Madisonville with signage for I-84 Heading through Moscow, PA 690 is primarily residential, passing the local high school and into downtown, where commercial businesses begin to appear. In downtown Moscow, the highway intersects with PA 435 (Main Street) and turns south onto a concurrency on South Main Street. Paralleling the tracks of the Delaware‚ÄìLackawanna Railroad, PA 690 soon splits off under the tracks. Turning northward after the underpass, PA 690 heads northward on Market Street, passing the former Moscow train station. The stretch along Market Street is mainly commercial, before the designation turns off Market at the intersection with Brook Street. Along Brook Street, the route is primarily residential. Before crossing the borough line, PA 690 remains known as Brook Street, but after the borough line, the route becomes woodlands. Soon changing names to Madisonville Road, PA 690 passes a residential complex and enters Madisonville, a rural hamlet. After the intersection with Reservoir Road, the highway turns from the northeast and curves into the hamlet of Aberdeen. After crossing through Aberdeen, PA 690 turns northeastward into the hamlet of Quicktown, where the highway crosses under I-84, but does not intersect with it. Just after crossing under I-84, the route crosses the county line into Wayne County and gains the name Hollisterville Road. From there, PA 690 heads northeast away from Interstate 84 in rural settings until entering the hamlet of Hollisterville. There, the route passes several residences before intersecting with PA 590 (Hamlin Highway). The right-of-way merges into PA 590 and the designation of PA 690 ends. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 690 was not given a number. PA 690 was designated in 1928 to run from US 611 (now PA 435) in Moscow northeast to PA 590 in Hollisterville along an unpaved road. By 1930, the road between PA 502 and US 611 in Moscow was an unnumbered, unpaved road. PA 690 was extended west from Moscow to PA 502 in the 1930s. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved between PA 502 and the border of Lackawanna and Wayne counties. The section of PA 690 between the county line and PA 590 was paved in the 1940s. Major intersections PA 690 Truck Pennsylvania Route 690 Truck is a truck route that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over the Van Brunt Creek near Moscow, Pennsylvania, on which trucks over 26 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 307, PA 502, and PA 435, and it was established in 2013.

It was the best-selling novel in Portugal in 2006, selling 100,000 copies. The novel narrates a quest for the scientific proof of the existence of god by a Portuguese professor, Tom√°s Noronha, based on a formula developed by Albert Einstein himself. The adventure takes place in Iran, Tibet and Portugal, with the involvement of the CIA. The book presents an innovative view about the origins of the universe, based on recent physics theories.  Story  It is the spring of 1951. Just off a small street in Princeton, NJ, an unidentified man stands hidden, carefully monitoring an unfolding scene. A police-escorted motorcade stops at a small, unremarkable house while an old man with a shock of white hair jumps out of the lead car. As he ambles up the walkway, a man of around the same age‚Äîalso sporting wild white hair‚Äîdescends from the porch and warmly greets him. The observer lurking in the shadows is CIA ‚Äî fellow operatives are also close by, recording the conversation taking place inside the house between newly arrived Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and his host, the word- renowned scientist Albert Einstein. The subject of their conversation: nuclear weapons and the existence of God. World-famous cryptanalyst Tom√°s Noronha is waiting on the front steps of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo when an attractive, dark-haired woman approaches and invites him to lunch in the Moslem quarter. Her name is Ariana Pakravan. She is Iranian and during the course of their lunch hires Tom√°s to decipher a cryptogram hidden in an unknown document that has been recently discovered in Iran and is at present being kept under heavy security in Tehran. The document turns out to be a manuscript written by Albert Einstein, and its content may prove so extraordinary that it's likely to shake the world. The manuscript's title is, simply, Die Gottesformel. The Einstein Enigma. Before Tom√°s leaves for Tehran, however, the American cultural attach√© in Lisbon invites him for a meeting at the US Embassy. There, the cryptanalyst meets with two CIA operatives who warn him that the manuscript in question is in fact Einstein's recipe for an easily produced atomic bomb, commissioned many years ago by Israeli Prime Minister David Ben- Gurion. Iran cannot be allowed to develop such a weapon: Tom√°s is assigned the mission of co-operating with the Iranians in order to ascertain the precise content of the manuscript and report back his findings. Once in Tehran, Tom√°s finds that the manuscript, written in German, is filled with enigmatic riddles. The first is a strange and dark poem written in English: :Die Gottesformel :Terra if fin :De terrors tight :Sabbath fore :Christ nite : :See sign :!ya ovqo As Tom√°s begins to decipher the rest of the manuscript, he finds that it contains much more than he had bargained for - something beyond his imagination. The enigma surrounding Einstein's ultimate legacy places Tom√°s on a dangerous collision course with a nuclear crisis involving Iran. But, more importantly, it puts him on the trail of the greatest mystery of all: The scientific proof of God's existence. The Einstein Enigma is a story of love and treason, and a quest for a fundamental truth. It is a fast-paced, compelling adventure that takes Tom√°s and Ariana, together with the reader on a breathtaking pursuit from Cairo to Lhasa, from Princeton to Tehran, and from Coimbra to Shigatse. Along the way, The Einstein Enigma offers up a mystic fusion of science and religion, a meeting of Einstein and God in an unforgettable spiritual search that reaches its climax with the stunning revelation of the greatest and most elusive secret of the universe. The design of existence. Based on the most advanced findings in physics, cosmology and mathematics, this latest Jos√© Rodrigues dos Santos‚Äô novel takes us on a surprising and amazing trip to the beginning of time, the essence of the universe, and the very meaning of life. In an entertaining way, readers will discover true scientific data hidden in each of the major spiritual texts, from the Jewish Cabbala, to the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Hindu Vedas and Upanishads, the Buddhist Avatamsaka sutra and Prajnaparamita, and the Taoist Tao Te Ching. Even more remarkable perhaps, readers are introduced in a lively, popular fashion to a number of scientific concepts, including Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Chaos Theory, the Incompleteness Theorems, the second law of thermodynamics and the Anthropic Principle. The Einstein Enigma. The great journey is about to begin.

A prospect scout typically looks for younger players with potential or existing players whose rights may be available through free agency or trade. An advance scout, however, helps prepare the team by studying the strategies or tendencies of opposing teams. Scouts travel extensively, attending basketball games to do these evaluations. Scouting attire and equipment Scouts will sometimes dress very casually so as to blend in with the public and fans at the game. This is done so other teams do not know the players that their respective organization may be actively interested in. In the late 1990s, NBA scouts began using computers to organize information or compile data used to evaluate and grade each player or team being scouted. Scouting criteria There are many factors which contribute to a scout's analysis of a player and scouts place differing importance on each of these factors. This is commonly called projection. Projection influences some of the best and worst decisions scouts and general managers make. The most basic projections which a scout must make include the player's physical status such as height, weight, age, position, and conditioning. The scout will also the study the player's skillset including: shooting and scoring capabilities, ball handling, defensive capabilities, and passing abilities. The scout will also attempt to note the presence or absence of intangibles such as coachability, character, desire, and instincts.

He played club football for the Gold Coast Seagulls/Chargers, the North Sydney Bears and the Northern Eagles. Goddard was also selected for the Queensland Maroons on four occasions, three of them starting at hooker. Background Goddard was born in Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. Early years Goddard first played junior football at the age of 13 with Brothers Mount Isa. He was playing with the Queensland Under 19s team when spotted by the Gold Coast team. Gold Coast In 1992, Goddard made his debut with the Gold Coast Seagulls in a 26-6 win over Parramatta Eels, but it was to be his only appearance for the season. In 1993 and 1994, he made a handful of appearances, mostly from the bench, but it wasn't until 1995 that cemented his position at hooker, winning the job from Eddie Fallins. Goddard played with Gold Coast Chargers, as they became known, captaining the club until their exit from the competition at the end of the 1998 NRL season. He holds the club record for most first grade matches (86), and was a member of the first Gold Coast team to make, and win, a semi- final during the split 1997 season in which they defeated the Illawarra Steelers 25-14. His team-mates included Marcus Bai, Wes Patten, Martin Bella and Scott Sattler. North Sydney and Northern Eagles With the closure of the Chargers, Goddard signed with North Sydney Bears for the 1999 season. He started from the bench in his first game, behind Mark Soden, but was the starting hooker for the remainder of the year, scoring 7 tries. Goddard played in Norths final ever game as a first grade side which was a 28-18 victory against North Queensland in Townsville. With the merger between Norths and Manly in 2000, Goddard found himself playing with the newly formed Northern Eagles. He played 50 games with the Eagles, mostly starting from the bench in the first 2 seasons. Goddard was starting at hooker in 2002, but at the end of that season Manly dissolved their relationship with the Bears, and Goddard retired. Representative Goddard played 4 games for the Queensland Maroons. He played in all 3 games in the 1997 series, when many of Queensland's stars were playing in the rival Super League Tri-series. Queensland lost the series 2-1. The next year he played hooker in the series-deciding third match, which Queensland won. Goddard never played Origin football again, though he was named in the 22-man squad as late as 2002. Goddard's contribution is perhaps best remembered for a fight he had with Andrew Johns during the third match of the 1997 series, when he knocked Johns to the ground and Johns required 27 stitches.

Opened in 1927, it served the areas of St Leonards and St Ives as well as the village of Ashley Heath itself. This was an emerging residential area, the northern part of what is now the South East Dorset conurbation. The halt consisted of two concrete platforms each with a shelter. There was also a public siding for goods traffic behind the down (south) side platform. The halt was closed during the Beeching Axe, losing its passenger trains in 1964. History The Southampton and Dorchester Railway (sponsored by the London and South Western Railway) opened the line here in 1847; it crossed Horton Road at a level crossing, named Woolsbridge Crossing after a hamlet to the west. At the time, this area was sparsely-populated heathland on the fringe of Ringwood Forest and there was no need for a station. Spurred by the nearby residential developments of St Leonards, St Ives and Ashley Heath, the Southern Railway (successor to the LSWR) opened an unmanned two-platform halt adjacent to the crossing on 1 April 1927. The halt passed to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, and the line and station were then closed to passengers by the British Railways Board on 4 May 1964. Track lifting was completed by 1968. The station today The site is now on the Castleman Trailway, off Horton Road, the road from the Ashley Heath interchange to Three Legged Cross.

On 8 February, it was revealed by a FactWire investigation that there were six cases of safety incidents involving ‚Äúloss of separation‚Äù in January 2017 because CAD's new air traffic management system (ATMS) did not operate correctly. Five of the cases occurred during the peak-time Lunar New Year holidays, and none was made known to the public. As a comparison, it was noted that only 10 incidents of \\"loss of separation\\" would happen per year under the previous system and such cases were treated as very serious due to the risk of mid-air collision.\\" After criticism of having covered up the 6 \\"los\\" incidents, CAD released a statement on their website at 11:34pm to claim that all incidents are \\"minor\\", although industry experts claim that all \\"los\\" incidents should be treated as serious due to the potential damage.

The southern terminus is at PA 997 in Greene Township. The northern terminus is at PA 997 in Hopewell Township. PA 696 begins at PA 997 adjacent to an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) and heads northeast through farmland parallel to the interstate. The route turns north and has an interchange with I-81 before it continues into Shippensburg, where it has a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) and PA 533 in the downtown area. Past Shippensburg, PA 696 runs north through more farmland and heads to Newburg, where it has a short concurrency with PA 641. The route heads northwest from here to its terminus at PA 997. In 1928, the road between Shippensburg and Newburg was designated as part of PA 333. PA 696 was designated in 1930 to run from US 11 in Chambersburg northeast to PA 996 (Main Street) in Scotland, running along Scotland Road. In 1937, PA 696 was extended north from Scotland to PA 641 in Newburg, replacing the section of PA 333 between Shippensburg and Newburg. The south end of the route was cut back to its current location at PA 997 in the 1960s, with the road between Chambersburg and Scotland becoming unnumbered. In the 1970s, PA 696 was extended north from Newburg to PA 997. Route description PA 696 begins at an intersection with PA 997 a short distance to the east of I-81 in Greene Township, Franklin County, heading north on two-lane undivided Olde Scotland Road. A short distance later, the route comes to a pair of ramps providing access to and from the northbound lanes of I-81. The road continues immediately to the east of I-81 as it heads into agricultural areas, turning northeast away from the interstate. PA 696 runs through more open farmland with a few homes, crossing into Southampton Township. In this area, the road turns north again and comes to a full interchange with I-81. Past this interchange, the route turns northeast again and runs through more rural areas with some residential and commercial development, running a short distance to the east of Norfolk Southern's Lurgan Branch railroad line. PA 696 in Hopewell Township from PA 997 PA 696 crosses into Shippensburg Township in Cumberland County and curves east, making a turn north onto South Fayette Street. The route briefly becomes the border between Shippensburg Township to the west and Shippensburg to the east before fully entering Shippensburg Township again, passing under the Lurgan Branch and crossing Middle Spring Creek prior to heading back into Southampton Township, Franklin County. The road runs through commercial areas, heading into Shippensburg before crossing back into Cumberland County and passing under Norfolk Southern's Lurgan Running Track railroad line. PA 696 passes a few homes before entering the commercial downtown of Shippensburg, turning east to form a concurrency with US 11/PA 533 on West King Street. PA 696 splits from US 11/PA 533 by turning north onto North Earl Street and heading past homes. The route heads back into Shippensburg Township and passes between residential areas to the west and Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania to the east, briefly gaining a center left-turn lane near the York Drive intersection before becoming a two-lane road again. The road turns northwest and heads into Southampton Township, becoming Newburg Road as it enters agricultural areas with some woods and housing developments, curving north again. PA 696 enters more rural areas as it heads farther north, crossing into Hopewell Township. In this area, the route becomes Shippensburg Road as it passes through more farmland with some woods and homes. The road crosses the Conodoguinet Creek and curves northwest, heading into Newburg and becoming South Water Street, passing homes. PA 696 curves north and turns west to follow PA 641 for a block on West Main Street. The route splits from PA 641 by turning northwest onto North Mountain Street. The road heads back into Hopewell Township and becomes Turnpike Road, passing through agricultural areas with a few homes. PA 696 continues northwest to its northern terminus at another intersection with PA 997. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 696 was not assigned a number. By this time, a paved road ran between Chambersburg and Scotland. In 1928, the road between US 11 in Shippensburg and Newburg was designated as part of PA 333, which was paved. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. PA 696 was designated in 1930 to run from US 11 in Chambersburg northeast to PA 996 (Main Street) in Scotland, following Broad Street, Scotland Avenue, and Scotland Road. In 1937, PA 696 was extended north from Scotland to PA 641 in Newburg, replacing the former section of PA 333 between Shippensburg and Newburg. The entire length of PA 696 was a paved road in the 1930s along with the unnumbered road from Newburg north to PA 944 (now PA 997). In the 1960s, the south end of PA 696 was moved to its current location at PA 997 near the I-81 interchange, with the road between Chambersburg and Scotland becoming unnumbered. PA 696 was extended north from Newburg to its present northern terminus at PA 997 in the 1970s.

The miniseries is adapted from the third and fourth novels of author Mary Norton's The Borrowers series: The Borrowers Afloat (1959) and The Borrowers Aloft (1961), respectively. The miniseries is the sequel to The Borrowers, another TV miniseries that first aired in 1992 also on BBC2 and TNT. Like the first series, every episode (except the last one) ended on a cliffhanger. Both series follow the Clocks, a family of tiny people who have fled from their home under the floorboards in an old manor into the English countryside. Plot Once again the Clock Family (a teenage girl named Arrietty and her parents, Pod and Homily), tiny \\"borrowers\\" who live in a cottage of regular sized human beings, are forced to find a new place to live when they learn of the upcoming departure of the humans in whose house they reside. Hendreary, Lupy, and Eggletina remain behind at the cottage. With the help of their friend Spiller, Arrietty, Pod, and Homily escape through the house drain system and temporarily move to a kettle Spiller has looked after. Spiller tells the Clock family about a model village called Little Fordham which is down the stream. Pod and Arrietty go back to the Manor where George provides them with a \\"boat\\" (which is actually a large cutlery holder with a pin for an anchor and a knife for steering). Meanwhile, Pod's nephews Ditchley and Ilrick trap Pod and Homily in the kettle as a joke by jamming the lid on with a stick, then leave. A storm comes and the kettle is swept down the stream. A rock knocks the stick off the lid and Pod and Homily manage to get out of the kettle before it hits a large stick suspended across two rocks. The next morning, Spiller and Arrietty find the kettle sunk near the bank just as Ditchley and Ilrick arrive, realizing their joke went too far. Pod and Homily arrive and Pod interrogates Ditchley and Ilrick for their actions and scares them off. The Clock family sail down the stream overnight and are nearly caught by Mild Eye, who is stopped by a Police Officer who presumably arrests him. The Borrowers arrive in Little Fordham where they try to live in secret. A relative of George's called Ms. Menzies arrives at the manor and explains to Mrs. Driver that George sent a letter to his parents saying that he wasn't happy at the manor. Ms. Menzies then explains it would be better if George were to spend his Summer Holidays with her instead. Mrs. Driver is more than happy to accept it and George leaves with Ms. Menzies to stay in a place called Fordham, which is the town Little Fordham was modeled after. Arrietty befriends Miss Menzies and also meets George, but unknown to the Clocks, the owner of Little Fordham, Mr. Pott, sees two of them while attending to the model buildings. The Borrowers are eventually discovered by a couple who own a rival model village and are kidnapped with the intention of being put on attraction when that model village opens for tourist season. Imprisoned in the couple's attic, the Clocks are able to use materials they find to create a hot-air balloon and basket which lifts them out of a window to freedom moments before they are to be put on display. Knowing they cannot risk moving back into Little Fordham, the family again take to the great outdoors, in search of a new place to call home. Spiller tells the Clocks that there's an old watermill, one human and plenty to eat down the stream. Arrietty writes a letter to George explaining that they are leaving Little Fordham, and thanking him, Ms. Menzies and Mr. Pott for everything. The series ends with the Borrowers sailing down the stream, and Pod says that whatever happens, there's always some way to manage.

Though he was cited by Alessandro Volta as a key influence on his own work, Bennet's work was curtailed by the political turbulence of his time.Elliott (1999) Life Abraham was baptised in Taxal, Derbyshire, the son of another Abraham Bennet, a schoolmaster, and his wife Ann n√©e Fallowes. There is no record of him having attended university but he is recorded as a teacher at Wirksworth Grammar School as \\"MA\\". He was ordained in London in 1775 and appointed curate at Tideswell and, one year later, additionally at Wirksworth, with a combined annual stipend of ¬£60. He further became rector of Fenny Bentley, domestic chaplain to the Duke of Devonshire, perpetual curate of Woburn and librarian to the Duke of Bedford. Bennet had broad interests in natural philosophy and was associated with, though not a member of, the Lunar Society and the Derby Philosophical Society. He was particularly close to Erasmus Darwin. Darwin suggested that Bennet make electrical measurements as part of an investigation into electricity and weather. Bennet then worked assiduously to establish his expertise in electricity, achieving a reputation sufficient to take part in a meeting with Tiberius Cavallo, William Nicholson and Volta in London in 1782. New Experiments Bennet published New Experiments on Electricity in 1789. In it, he described: *The gold-leaf electroscope; *A doubler of electricity, already announced in a paper communicated to the Royal Society by Rev. Richard Kaye FRS, Dean of Lincoln in 1787; and *A theory of electricity that anticipated Volta's contact theory. Bennet's work was a key element in leading Volta to the contact theory and the development of the voltaic pile. Bennet described experiments with an electrophorus and the generation of electricity by evaporation. Bennet extended his thinking into various theories about electricity and weather, with electrical explanations of the aurora borealis and meteors. He interpreted lightning as the release of electrical charge from clouds, and went on to hypothesise that rain was caused by lightning and also that earthquakes had an electrical origin. Politics Among Bennet's other patrons were Joseph Banks, George Adams and the Wirksworth squires, the Gell family. The Gells, Kaye, Banks, Adams, and the Dukes of Devonshire and Bedford were all establishment figures whose hostility to the radicals of the Lunar and Derby Philosophical Societies intensified in the British reaction to the French Revolution. Bennet found it increasingly necessary to take sides, signing the Gells' petition against Jacobinism in 1795. Bennet's scientific work ends around this date, possibly from ill-health but also possibly from his inability to resolve the tensions among his erstwhile supporters. Personal life He married Jane (died 1826) and the couple had six daughters and two sons. Bennet died of a \\"severe illness\\".

His television credits include parts on all three Law & Order series, Third Watch, and Conviction. In addition to roles in several theater productions, Grabstein co-wrote and co- starred with Rick Mowat for their sketch comedy act Lab Rats, which performed to rave reviews in comedy clubs throughout New York City. For instance, as The Lab Rats they were regular performers in Joel Selmeier's One Minute Play Contest about which John Heilpern, in a review in the New York Observer, wrote \\"one brilliant sketch (created and performed by two lunatics, Marty Grabstein and Rick Mowat) had me on the floor with laughter. Entitled Long Fuse, it had just two lines of dialogue: \\"You got the dynamite?\\" There followed a pause, somewhat confused, for 58 seconds. A second man then answered, \\"No.\\" That was it! But there were more possibilities for infectious laughter in the mad silence that followed the surprise absurdest question - \\"You got the dynamite?\\" - than reams of dialogue could have provided.

Grabstein is well-known for doing the voice of the title character in the Cartoon Network animated series Courage the Cowardly Dog. Grabstein used a combination of paranoia and panic to make the voice of Courage authentic. In the first season of the cartoon, he actually said many spoken words as Courage. However, for the rest of the series, Grabstein did almost all of the character's dialogue by gibberish and mumbling because the show's producers felt that Courage \\"talked too much\\" and wanted the dog to be more laconic.http://couragede.tripod.com/cast/courmarty.html Personal life Marty's father, Danny was owner of the well known Grabstein's Deli in Canarsie, Brooklyn and his mother, Edna (n√©e Bine) was a talented singer who once sang Cabaret at Don't Tell Mama's in New York City.

The original program in Venezuela involves four after-school hours of musical training and rehearsal each week, plus additional work on the weekends. Most El Sistema- inspired programs in the United States provide seven or more hours of instruction per week, as well as free use of an instrument. Origin and history El Sistema began under the leadership of Jos√© Antonio Abreu (May 7, 1939 ‚Äì March 24, 2018) with 11 students in an underground parking garage. For many years, its official name was Fundaci√≥n del Estado para el Sistema Nacional de las Orquestas Juveniles e Infantiles de Venezuela, (FESNOJIV), which is sometimes translated into English as \\"National Network of Youth and Children's Orchestras of Venezuela.\\" The organizations has recently changed its name to Fundaci√≥n Musical Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (FMSB), but is still widely known by the FESNOJIV acronym.Tunstall (2012), p. 35 Abreu's vision Abreu has said that \\"music has to be recognized as an agent of social development in the highest sense because it transmits the highest values ‚Äî solidarity, harmony, mutual compassion,\\" crediting it with the ability to \\"unite an entire community and express sublime feelings.\\"Abreau, as quoted in Tunstall, p. 273 Abreu led the program for nearly four decades with the backing and material support of seven consecutive Venezuelan governments, ranging across the political spectrum from center-right to the current leftist presidency installed by Hugo Ch√°vez although Abreu has been \\"careful to keep El Sistema separate from partisan politics.\\"Tunstall (2012), p. 84 Combining political shrewdness with religious devotion, Abreu has pursued a Utopian vision, in which an orchestra represents the ideal society, and the sooner a child is nurtured in that environment, the better for all.Arthur Lubow, \\"Conductor of the People\\", The New York Times, 28 October 2007 Play and fight \\"Play and Fight\\" was the title of the El Nacional news story about the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras of Venezuela that appeared on February 2, 1976. The organization soon adopted that phrase as its motto, expressing its members' determination and commitment to El Sistema as a vital and critical project, both orchestrally and socially. Success stories Gustavo Dudamel, current musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, had his musical beginnings in El Sistema. According to Dudamel, \\"music saved my life and has saved the lives of thousands of at-risk children in Venezuela...like food, like health care, like education, music has to be a right for every citizen.\\"Boshkoff, p. 25 Among other El Sistema alumni with careers in music, Rafael Payare was hired as music director of San Diego Symphony, Christian Vasquez became Chief Conductor of the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, Joshua Dos Santos is the Music Director of the Orchestra of the Filipino Youth, Alexis Cardenas is violin concert master of L'Orchestre national d'√éle-de-France in Par√≠s, Edward Pulgar is Principal Second Violin of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra; Giovanni Guzzo teaches violin at the Royal Academy of Music in London and is principal guest leader of the Budapest Festival Orchestra; is principal oboe of the Orquesta Filarm√≥nica de Medell√≠n; Sergio Rosales conducted orchestras in Colombia, Belgium, Japan, and United States; double-bass player Edicson Ruiz became the youngest musician ever to join the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra; Tulio Cremisini is the Principal Timpanist with Miami Symphony Orchestra; and Pedro Eustache is a multidirectional soloist flautist, and world-class reed and woodwind player. Alcides Rodriguez, a clarinetist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, has said that \\"the System was an open door to another dimension, a different world that I probably could have never seen.\\" On 4 September 2016 Paul Desenne's work Hipnosis mariposa was premiered at The BBC PromsProm 67: Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Symphony Orchestra and Gustavo Dudamel, Royal Albert Hall by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Symphony Orchestra conducted by Gustavo Dudamel. Venezuelan government involvement The program has a reputation for rescuing young people in impoverished circumstances, directing them away from lives of drug abuse and crime, into which they would likely otherwise be drawn. The Venezuelan government of President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez began fully financing Abreu's orchestra after its success, in 1976, at the \\"International Festival of Youth Orchestras\\" in Aberdeen, Scotland. From the beginning, El Sistema came not under the ministry of culture, but under the umbrella of social-services ministries, which has strategically helped it survive. The current Chavez administration has been El Sistema's most generous patron so far, covering almost its entire annual operating budget, as well as additional capital projects. Abreu received the National Music Prize for his work in 1979 and became Minister of Culture in 1983. In 1995, Abreu was appointed Special Ambassador for the Development of a Global Network of Youth and Children Orchestras and Choirs by UNESCO. He also became a special representative for the development of orchestras within the framework of UNESCO's \\"World Movement of Youth and Children Orchestras and Choirs.\\" At the time, its network of 102 youth and 55 children's orchestras (including approximately 100,000 youngsters) came under the supervision of the Ministry of Family, Health and Sports. A goal of El Sistema is to use music for the protection of children through training, rehabilitation, and prevention of criminal behavior. In September 2007, with Abreu present on the television talk-show, Al√≥ Presidente, the president Hugo Ch√°vez announced a new government program, Misi√≥n M√∫sica, designed to provide tuition and music instruments to Venezuelan children. It has been noted that \\"various ministries oversaw El Sistema until two years ago, when the president's office took direct control. El Sistema's mission runs parallel to Mr. Ch√°vez's program to provide subsidies and services to the poor.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/arts/music/venezuelans-criticize- hugo-chavezs-support-of-el-sistema.html?scp=2&sq;=El%20Sistema&st;=cse There have been objections, however, to Chavez's involvement from those who oppose the policies of the present government. Spread of regional centres in Venezuela On 6 June 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank announced the granting of a US$150 million loan for the construction of seven regional centers of El Sistema throughout Venezuela. Many bankers within the IDB originally objected to the loan on the grounds that classical music is for the elite. But then the bank has conducted studies on the more than 2,000,000 young people, educated in El Sistema, linking participation in the program to improvements in school attendance and reduction in juvenile delinquency and crime rates. Weighing such benefits, the bank calculated that every dollar invested in El Sistema was reaping about $1.68 in social dividends. Supported by the government, El Sistema started introducing its music program into the public-school curriculum, aiming to be in every school and to support 500,000 children by 2015. The project has also been extended to the penal system. On 25 May 2008, Leidys Asuaje wrote for Venezuelan daily El Nacional: \\"The plan to humanize jails through music began 11 months ago under the tutelage of the Ministry of the Interior and Justice and FESNOJIV....\\" Controversy In November 2014, British music scholar Geoffrey Baker published a newspaper articlehttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/11/geoff-baker-el-sistema- model-of-tyranny and a bookEl Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela's Youth (Oxford University Press) that disputed many of the claims made by and about El Sistema and suggested that much of the publicly circulating information about the program was hyperbolic or simply false. The book's allegations included a culture of authoritarianism, hyper-discipline, exploitation, competition, and gender discrimination. It argued that the program was deeply conservative beneath its progressive exterior and that its claims of social transformation were unproven and exaggerated. For example, Baker's work alleges that the IADB's claim that El Sistema was reaping about $1.68 in social dividends for each $1 invested was based on dubious calculations and had been withdrawn by the bank itself. Considerable controversy ensued, with furious denunciations by Sistema advocates and enthusiastic responses from music education experts. In his review of Baker's book, Damian Thompson, arts editor for The Spectator highlighted Baker's contention that the rampant sexual abuse of young musicians in El Sistema is part of \\"classical music's dirty little secret.\\"Thompson, Damian (6 December 2014). \\"Sex, lies and El Sistema\\". The Spectator Simon Bolivar Orchestra Simon Bolivar Children Orchestra in Maracaibo, Zulia State An important product of El Sistema is the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra. In the mid-1990s, Abreu formed the National Children's Youth Orchestra, and many young musicians graduated from it to the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var which grew considerably in size. This\\"became an opportunity to re- create the ensemble as two separate performing entities. The first generation of members was designated the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var A; the younger, newer members, who had recently been brought in from the new National Children's Orchestra, now constituted the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var B\\"Tunstall (2012), pp. 118‚Äì125 The Sim√≥n Bol√≠var B is now the touring orchestra and, in 2007, made its debut at the BBC Proms in London's Royal Albert Hall and later at Carnegie Hall under the baton of Gustavo Dudamel, receiving enthusiastic reviews.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/22/arts/music/22educ.html?ref=arts 2009 saw the orchestra touring in the US, but also in Europe as well. In the spring of 2010, however, a tour to the Lucerne Easter Festival drew comments from reviewers, such as Tom Service of London's The Guardian, that the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Youth Orchestra was \\"youthful no longer.\\"Quoted in Tunstall (2012), p. 125 This struck home, and Abreu decided, as he put it, \\"the time is once again ripe for new, younger national orchestras.\\" And so, he set about creating new ensembles. The Teresa Carre√±o Symphony Youth Orchestra, named for the famous Venezuelan pianist, started international touring in the autumn of 2010 with appearances at the Beethoven Fest in Bonn, followed by Vienna, Berlin, Amsterdam, Madrid, and London.Tunstall (2012), p. 126 Other new youth orchestras include the Caracas Symphony Youth Orchestra and a newly constituted National Children's Orchestra consisting of 358 musicians.Tunstall (2012), p. 127 In other countries USA El Sistema USA is a membership organization, which supports and encourages more than 80 El Sistema-inspired programs throughout the United States, a number which are growing rapidly.

He was Vice-Chancellor of Monash University from 1987-1996. Logan grew up in country New South Wales, attending secondary school in the remote town of Tamworth. He moved to Sydney to complete an honours degree in geography at the University of Sydney, which he finished in 1951. After spending some time as a teacher in secondary schools, he returned to Sydney to complete his PhD and take up a position as Professor of Geography and Urban Planning. He then spent time at a range of universities overseas, living in the US and Nigeria. Later in his career, he became involved in both the World Bank and the OECD as an adviser on urban planning. In 1971, Sir Louis Matheson, then Vice-Chancellor of Monash, invited Logan to take up a professorship at Monash. Although Logan knew little about Monash at the time, he wanted to return to Australia, and chose the University because it seemed \\"the liveliest and brightest place\\". Once there, he quickly raised through the administrative ranks, first as Pro Vice-Chancellor and then, in 1987, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor. His leadership at Monash marked the most drastic expansion of a University in Australian history. Prompted by the Dawkins reforms, Logan aggressively pursued Monash's takeover of a number of tertiary institutions. He was attracted to the notion of a \\"multiversity\\", similar to the big state universities in the US, such as the University of California and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison.Microsoft Word - Monash case study final.doc Monash went from one campus in Clayton with 20,000 students, to 6 Victorian campuses with 40,000 students. Through Logan's close personal relationships with members of the Hawke and Keating governments, Logan was able to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to develop the new campuses. He also argued that Australia's future lay in Asia. Consequently, he established a Monash teaching presence in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Laos. He also oversaw the massive increase in international students at Monash, particularly from Asia. He established the university's link with the Sunway Group, a relationship which led to the establishment of a Monash Malaysia Campus in 1998. With the increased inflow of international students, Monash's income increased dramatically, such that its annual reports were often discussed in financial newspapers. Reportedly, Logan was fond of citing the fact that Monash's annual budget was greater than the State of Tasmania's. In the year that he retired, 1996, he became a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), the highest honour which can be awarded to an Australian citizen.Simon Marginson, Monash: Remaking the University, Allen & Unwin, 2000, pp. 76-77  References  Category:Australian geographers Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Tamworth, New South Wales ","title":"Mal Logan"},{"id":"13061350","text":"Robert Braiden Robert Braiden is an Australian film director and writer.

(Nov 13, 2000) \\"Accreditation gains attention.\\" Modern Healthcare 30(47):46. Providing healthcare, especially of an adequate standard, is a complex and challenging process. Healthcare is a vital and emotive issue‚Äîits importance pervades all aspects of societies, and it has medical, social, political, ethical, business, and financial ramifications. In any part of the world healthcare services can be provided either by the public sector or by the private sector, or by a combination of both, and the site of delivery of healthcare can be located in hospitals or be accessed through practitioners working in the community, such as general medical practitioners and dentists. This is occurring in most parts of the developed world in a setting in which people are expressing ever-greater expectations of hospitals and healthcare services. This trend is especially strong where socialised medical systems exist. For example, in the European Union \\"... patients have ever-greater expectations of what health systems ought to deliver,\\" although there has been a \\"... continuous rise in costs of services determined by scientific and technological innovation.\\"Office for International Public Health and Social Affairs. \\"Contribution to the Reflection Process for a New EU Health Strategy.\\" Venice Italy: Regional Health and Social Department. And in one particular EU member state, the United Kingdom, \\"... People are going to increase demand and they have also got an increased expectation of what the NHS can deliver.\\"UK Parliament Select Committee on Health (9 February 2006). Minutes of Evidence. Examination of Witnesses Bernie Hurn and Michael Hall (Questions 520 - 530)]. The USA manifests some differences here, and is an unusual and distinct oddity among developed Western countries. In 2007, 45.7 million of the overall US population (i.e. 15.3%) had no health insurance whatsoeverSherman, A., R. Greenstein, and S. Parrott (August 26, 2008). \\"Poverty and Share of Americans Without Healthcare Were Higher in 2007...\\". Washington: Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities. yet in 2007 the USA spent nearly $2.3 trillion on healthcare, or 16% of the country's gross domestic product, more than twice as much per capita as the OECD average. Because of this, some US citizens are having to look outside of their country to find affordable healthcare, through the medium of medical tourism, also known as \\"Global Healthcare\\" (see below). Apart from using hospitals and healthcare services to regain their health if it has become impaired, or to prevent ill health occurring in the first place, people the world over may also use them for a wide variety of other services, for example ‚Äúimproving upon nature‚Äù (e.g. cosmetic surgery, gender reassignment surgery or acquiring help to overcome difficulties with becoming a parent (e.g. infertility treatment).  Healthcare and hospital accreditation  Fundamentally healthcare and hospital accreditation is about improving how care is delivered to patients and the quality of the care they receive. Accreditation has been defined as \\"A self- assessment and external peer assessment process used by health care organisations to accurately assess their level of performance in relation to established standards and to implement ways to continuously improve\\" . Interest in hospital accreditation ascends as far as the World Health Organization (see external links). Accreditation is one important component in patient safety. However, there is limited and contested evidence supporting the effectiveness of accreditation programs. In the USA in the early 20th century, there was concern over how to best create an appropriate environment in which clinicians could work. Standards to improve the control of the hospital environment were thus generated, and these subsequently grew into accreditation schemes with the remit to facilitate and improve organisational development. Part of the process is not only about assessing quality, but also about promoting and improving quality. Similar accreditation schemes were soon developed elsewhere in the world. In countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, sophisticated accreditation groups have grown up to survey hospitals (and, in some cases, healthcare in the community). Furthermore, other accreditation groups have been set up with openly declared remits to look after just one particular area of healthcare, such as laboratory medicine or psychiatric services or sexual health. Accreditation systems are structured so as to provide objective measures for the external evaluation of quality and quality management. Accreditation schemes should ideally focus primarily on the patient and their pathway through the healthcare system ‚Äì this includes how they access care, how they are cared for after discharge from hospital, and the quality of the services provided for them. At the heart of these schemes is a list of standards which, ideally, serve to assess evaluate in a systematic and comprehensive way the standards of professional performance in a hospital. This includes not only hand-on patient care but also training and education of staff, credentials, clinical governance and audit, research activity, ethical standards etc. The standards can also be used internally by hospitals to develop and improve their quality standards and quality management. Some international accreditation schemes believe that the standards applied should be fixed and are non-negotiable, while others operate a system of negotiation over standards - however, whatever approach is taken the every aspect of the process should be evidence-based. International standardization groups also exist, but it must be pointed out that the mere achieving of set standards is not the only factor involved in quality accreditation - there is also the significant matter of the incorporating into participating hospitals systems of self-examination, problem solving and self-improvement, and hence there is more to accreditation than following some sort of overall \\"standardization\\" process. As governments and the general public have increasingly come to demand more and more openness about health care and its delivery, including and especially hospital quality and safety and the clinical performance of doctors, and these accreditation systems have generally adapted to fulfill this extended role. However, accreditation should ideally be independent of governmental control, and accreditation groups should assess hospitals ‚Äúholistically‚Äù, and not just some isolated facet of the hospital‚Äôs activities or services such as the laboratories, pharmacy services, infection control, financial health or information technology services (indeed, partial accreditation of this type should be publicly acknowledged as such by both the accreditation scheme and the hospital). The best accreditation schemes also assess academic and intellectual activity (such as teaching and research) within those hospitals that they survey (see later) and have a clear and declared interest in medical ethics. In some parts of the world, accessing healthcare can be very expensive, even prohibitively so. While some countries have elected to provide comprehensive healthcare services for all of their populations, others appear to be satisfied with leaving portions of their population without access to healthcare. When it comes to who pays the bills for healthcare, it may be the government or it may be the individual (sometimes either by direct payment, and sometimes through employer-run schemes, insurance companies etc.), or a combination of both. However, healthcare can never be truly ‚Äúfree‚Äù ‚Äì someone somewhere will always have to pay, and the payer will always want the best value for money possible. \\"Affordability\\" of healthcare can be the insurmountable hurdle for some human beings. Value for money is hence another factor in assessing the true quality of healthcare.  Background  A number of larger countries engage in hospital accreditation that is provided internally. Taking the USA as an example, numerous groups provide accreditation for internal healthcare organizations, including the AAAHC Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, doing business internationally as \\"Acreditas Global\\", Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP), the Joint Commission, TJC, Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (ACHC), the \\"Exemplary Provider Program\\" of The Compliance Team, American Accreditation Commission International (AACI), and the Healthcare Quality Association on Accreditation (HQAA). Some other countries have looked towards accessing the services of the major international healthcare accreditation groups based in other countries to assess their healthcare services. There are many reasons for this, including cost, a desire to improve healthcare quality for one‚Äôs own citizens (good governance is at the basis of all high-quality healthcare), or a desire to market one‚Äôs healthcare services to ‚Äúmedical tourists‚Äù (see below). Some hospitals go for international healthcare accreditation as a de facto form of advertising. In response to this marketing opportunity, some national accreditation groups have expanded their wings internationally, and gone on to survey and accredit hospitals outside of their own national borders. When they choose to do this, such groups can be said to be providing \\"international healthcare accreditation\\". This process of accreditation has been made increasingly complicated by the fact that in many parts of the world, more and more human beings are choosing to cross international borders to access healthcare, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúmedical tourism‚Äù or \\"Global Healthcare\\". Medical tourism/Global Healthcare cannot be ignored as a key issue in international healthcare accreditation - it is becoming increasingly important as millions of (especially) Europeans and Americans seek healthcare overseas outside of their own countries for a variety of reasons (including and especially affordability), and it represents a growing multibillion- euro/dollar/pound business of increasing importance to the economies of many countries, such as Singapore, Thailand, India, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. The importance of medical tourism/Global Healthcare to the economy of developing countries is increasingly the subject of academic study. , and this synergy has a clear \\"knock-on\\" effect for those organizations based within the developed world who are seeking to develop the medical tourism/Global Healthcare market. The reasons why patients are seeking out medical tourism/Global Healthcare options are manifold; :(a) healthcare may be too expensive at home :(b) waiting lists may be too long :(c) patients wish to access treatments not available at home (e.g. stem cell therapy, termination of pregnancy, unlicensed medications, gender re-assignment surgery) :(d) patients wish for greater confidentiality than may be feasible at home (e.g. HIV/AIDS treatment, infertility treatment, gender re-assignment surgery, face lifts) :(e) new challenges arise from time to time, such as new medical developments which are not universally accessible, the emergence of the so- called ‚Äúsuperbugs‚Äù (e.g. MRSA, VRSA, VRE>Clostridium difficile, ESBL-producing E. coli), problems with the blood transfusion supply (e.g. Chaga's disease in the USA, HIV, HTLV-1 etc.), and the social imponderables such as war, political change and natural disasters. Any of these factors may lead to a loss of public confidence in healthcare services, and a desire to seek out healthcare overseas. The environmental and political situation will constantly vary throughout the world, and this will need to be factored into the equations. The following quotation, taken from the website of Partners Harvard Medical International, crystallizes the increasing relevance of international health care accreditation and its growing commercial importance, particularly in relation to medical tourism/global healthcare. \\"In competitive health care markets where patients have an increasing array of choices, quality is the most important differentiator for organizations striving for sustainability and both national and regional leadership. International accreditation has become a powerful indicator of a health care organization‚Äôs commitment to high-quality care and patient safety.\\" Reflecting this, much of the discussion on medical tourism blog sites reflects the increasing importance of international healthcare and hospital accreditation to this industry Consumers How does an individual contemplating becoming a medical tourist ensure that the overseas healthcare they are planning to access is as safe as possible and is of adequate quality? For sure, it is not simply a matter of looking at hospital buildings and at mattresses, and it is certainly not just an issue of looking only at the prices charged. While architecturally pleasing rooms and easier access to satellite television and the internet may improve personal comfort, and a bargain basement price may help the wallet, what is often more important may include such issues as: * the standards of governance in the hospital or clinic * the healthcare providing establishment‚Äôs commitment to self-improvement, and to learn positively from errors * the overall medical ethical standards operating within the organization * the clinical staff‚Äôs ethical standards and their personal and collective commitment to caring for patients and the wider community * the quality of the clinical staff, including their background educational attainment and training, and evidence of continuing professional development by those staff * the quality and ethical standards of the management and their personal and collective commitment to caring for patients and the wider community * the clinical track record of the hospital or clinic * the infection control track record of the hospital or clinic * the hospital may be located in a country where the environment and climate may bring a patient into contact with infectious and/or tropical diseases that are unfamiliar to them * evidence of a robust, just and fair system to deal with complaints made by patients when things go wrong, as they inevitably will from time to time, and where appropriate to compensate the injured party in a fair and reasonable way The above list is not exhaustive, but it represents a good start. Also, the intending medical tourist should check whether or not a hospital is wholly accredited by an international accreditation group, or if it is only partly accredited (e.g. for infection control), the latter being less inclined to create confidence in a potential consumer. How does the person in the street access this type of quality information? This can be very difficult. Accreditation schemes well-recognised as providing services in the international healthcare accreditation field include: * Joint Commission International (JCI) (based in the United States) * Trent Accreditation Scheme (based in UK-Europe) The former Trent Scheme (which ended in 2010) was the first scheme to accredit a hospital in Asia, in Hong Kong in 2000 The different accreditation schemes vary in approach, quality, size, intent, sourcing of surveyors and the skill of their marketing. They also vary in terms of how much they charge hospitals and healthcare institutions for their services. They all have web sites. Umbrella organizations The International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua) is an umbrella organisation for such organisations providing international healthcare accreditation . Its offices are based in the Republic of Ireland. ISQua is a small non-profit limited company with members in over 70 countries. ISQua works to provide services to guide health professionals, providers, researchers, agencies, policy makers and consumers, to achieve excellence in healthcare delivery to all people, and to continuously improve the quality and safety of care. ISQua does not actually survey or accredit hospitals or clinics itself. The United Kingdom Accreditation Forum, or UKAF, is a UK-based umbrella organisation for organisations providing healthcare accreditation . Its offices are based in London. Like ISQua, UKAF does not actually survey and accredit hospitals itself. India becomes 12th nation to join ISQua. Accreditation services If a hospital or clinic simply wishes to improve its services to patients wherever those patients come from (locally or from further afield), or wishes to attract medical tourists, how do they choose whom to go to when contemplating accessing external peer review by an accreditation group such as those listed above. No one healthcare system has a monopoly of excellence and no one provider country or scheme can claim to be the total arbiter of quality. The same is true of healthcare accreditation schemes. For example, some countries, such as the USA, perform very poorly when it comes to providing anything close to universal access to healthcare of adequate quality to the population living within their own borders. Others, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have created state-funded systems which provide everything without the assistance of the private sector. Different holistic accreditation schemes are sourced out of different parts of the world, for example in hospitals there is (see map): ** Joint Commission International (JCI) out of the USAhttp://www.jointcommissioninternational.org ** Accreditation Canada https://accreditation.ca/ ** QHA Trent out of the United Kingdomhttp://www.qha-trent.co.uk/ ** Australian Council on Health Care Standards International in Australiahttp://www.achs.org.au As no single international accreditation scheme enjoys exclusive rights to be seen as an overall worldwide-relevant scheme, some hospitals are looking towards multiple accreditation to achieve performance credibility in different parts of the world. Locations of geographical bases of four of the world's leading international hospital accreditation schemes Other fields of accreditation exist, such as stronger use of general medical practices (sometimes known as GP or Family Medicine) is some westernised countries. GP accreditation services, such as the Royal College of General Practitioners (RGCP)http://www.rcgp.org.uk/ in the United Kingdom, and Australian General Practice Accreditation Limited (AGPAL)http://www.agpal.com.au/ in Australia provide accreditation services for these practices. With respect to the cost of accreditation, this can vary enormously and it can be hard to find out precise data; in the case of JCI, the costs can be substantial. This is based on the country, size and operations of an organisation. With respect to hospital work, ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is often mistakenly considered to be an international healthcare accreditation scheme, however it is not.

She is the granddaughter of Ernst Himmler (1905‚Äì1945), who was the younger brother of Heinrich Himmler, one of the leading figures of Nazi Germany. Therefore, she is the great-niece of Heinrich Himmler. She is the author of Die Br√ºder Himmler: Eine deutsche Familiengeschichte, published in English as The Himmler Brothers: A German Family History. Book Katrin Himmler's book Die Br√ºder Himmler: Eine deutsche Familiengeschichte was published in 2005 in Germany by S. Fischer Verlag and in 2007 in English by Macmillan as The Himmler Brothers: A German Family History. Her book traces the lives of the three Himmler brothers (the eldest was Gebhard Himmler), the sons of a respected secondary school headmaster in Munich. Gebhard served in the German Army in World War I, but Heinrich, who at 18 was still an officer cadet when the war ended, was too young to see frontline service. Katrin Himmler speculates that it was frustration at this and envy of his brother that led Heinrich to join the extreme right-wing Freikorps in 1919. In the Freikorps he served under Ernst R√∂hm and was thus led into the Nazi Party. Despite her family being told her grandfather Ernst had had no interest in politics, Katrin discovered that he was an enthusiastic Nazi who had joined the party in 1931, and was also an officer in the Schutzstaffel (SS). Ernst was killed in the fighting in Berlin in May 1945. \\"Many times during my research it was quite difficult for me to go on,\\" Himmler told an interviewer in August 2007. \\"As things were revealed it became more and more shocking. We descendents were left in no doubt about what Heinrich had done. But his actions cast a large shadow that the rest of the family were standing in, many of them hiding in there.\\" Her most disturbing discovery was that her grandfather had directly caused the deportation and death of a Jewish engineer, a Major Schmidt, deputy manager of an engineering firm, who had been protected because of his expertise. Writing to Heinrich, Ernst dismissed his usefulness, knowing that he would then be reclassified and deported to a labour camp. Justin Cartwright, reviewing the book for The Daily Telegraph, commented: \\"As Katrin Himmler writes, it would have been perfectly possible for him [Ernst] to have supported Schmidt without any danger to himself as the brother of the Reichsf√ºhrer. For her this was a turning point: she realised once and for all just how deeply her grandfather and her great-uncle Gebhard were in thrall to their brother's murderous racial policies.\\" Doug Johnstone wrote in The List: \\"Katrin‚Äôs book is admirably level-headed, a meticulous memoir of an extraordinary family, and the author never resorts to histrionics, preferring to let the facts speak for themselves. Originally written as self-therapy, the book stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of guilt the Nazis left behind for future generations.\\" Robert Hawks, however, wrote in The Independent: \\"Katrin does try to turn some equivocal evidence into revelations of her family's complicity, but her prosecutorial stance gets in the way of empathy. In the end, The Himmler Brothers raises more questions about its subject than it is capable of answering, but that doesn't lessen in the slightest my admiration of Katrin Himmler for having written it.\\" Himmler is one of the protagonists of the television documentary Hitler's Children (in German: \\"Meine Familie, die Nazis und Ich\\")Meine Familie, die Nazis und Ich (Hitler's Children) (homepage of German television channel \\"Das Erste\\" June 13, 2012 ‚Äì only in German, archived) of the Israeli director Chanoch Zeevi about descendants of the Nazi elite, amongst them Rainer H√∂ss. Personal life Himmler was born in Dinslaken. She is married to an Israeli. Despite the opportunity to take her spouse's surname, she chose to keep the name Himmler, rather than deny her heritage. Katrin Himmler said that she researched and wrote the book so that her son would have a full understanding of his family's history. She told an interviewer: \\"When my husband and I had our son, it became clear I had to break with the family tradition of not speaking about the past. I wanted to give my son as much information as possible, so that when he starts asking questions about my family, at least I can answer him.\\" References  External links  * Katrin Himmler Katrin Himmlers' personal website * the Himmler family bonds * Time Magazine Time's 10 Questions for Katrin Himmler Category:German women writers Category:1967 births Category:Living people Katrin ","title":"Katrin Himmler"},{"id":"13061399","text":"Pennsylvania Route 711 (PA 711) is a , north-south state highway located in Fayette, Westmoreland and Indiana counties in Pennsylvania.

The names include Crawford Avenue, Snyder Street, Springfield Pike, Main Street, Ligonier Street, Stahlstown-Ligonier Road, Market Street, Market Street Extension, 13th Street, Second Street, Charles Road, and Indian Creek Valley Road. Even though its signed north-south along its route, the route in Fayette County takes a more east-west direction, and most of the rest of the route in Westmoreland and Indiana counties goes more of a southwest-northeast direction. Fayette County The route begins at an intersection of US 119 and PA 201 in the western part of Connellsville. The route goes east from the town to PA 381 in the village of Normalville, and begins a concurrency that spans for a before the route enters Westmoreland County. Westmoreland County The route continues its concurrency with PA 381 for another until it splits at Jones Mills. As soon as the concurrency ends, the route has another short concurrency with PA 31 from Jones Mills to the town of Donegal. Continuing on PA 31 will take you to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where the Donegal Exit (Exit 91) lies very close to PA 711 (Signage on the Turnpike shows this as a route to PA 711). After PA 711 itself passes over the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the route passes through Donegal, and heads northeast to the village of Stahlstown, where it has an intersection with PA 130. The route continues northeast to the town of Ligonier, where it intersects with US 30. After passing through town, the route continues northeast to PA 271 in the village of Oak Grove. The route heads north to the village of West Fairfield, where the route starts to parallel the Conemaugh River, and pass through the towns of New Florence and Seward. In the town of Seward, the route has a concurrency with PA 56, where it continues to Indiana County. Indiana County The route continues with PA 56 for a short distance to the village of Robindale Heights, where PA 56 splits from the route, and PA 711 heads east. It continues east to the village of Cramer, where the route terminates at PA 403. History PA 711 has a long history of changes and news along its route. The route was first signed in 1928, but construction along the route did not get completed until the early 1930s.

Old German Croppers, along with other varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants from the rock pigeon (Columba livia). An old breed that originated in Germany and Hungary. Description: The Old German Cropper is the longest breed of pigeon. It has a large well- inflated globe that is oval to round in shape. The old German stands with the front of its body raised in a semierect station and the rest of its body carried close and parallel to the ground. The wings are very long and ideally should extend beyond the tail. They should be well closed and not show a \\"sail like effect\\", that is caused by raised secondary feathers that break the smooth wing line. The legs are fairly short without showing the birds thighs that are covered by the undercarriage feathers. Colors & Markings: The Old German comes in black, white, red, yellow, dun, cream, mealy, silver, blue in bar and check, and lark. They are self-colored, but also can be found in splash or a random mixture of white and colored feathers, tiger which should have dark flights and tail with white feathers sprinkled on the rest of the body, flights marked with a solid colored body and evenly marked white flights on both wings, and mussel head which is primarily found in black which manifests itself with a sprinkling of white feathers on the head reminiscent of the coloring of the shell mussel. General The overall look of the Old German is large powerful pigeon. Some of this is created by the extreme feather development. The bird does not have a heavy body. Feather development should be smooth and neat without being tight.

Most Shanghainese are descended from immigrants from all over China. Only a minority are Shanghai natives, those with ancestral roots in Shanghai. The Old City of Shanghai was a minor settlement until the later Qing Dynasty and many districts of the present municipality of Shanghai originally had separate identities, including separate but related dialects of Taihu Wu. In recent decades, millions of Chinese have moved to the city, both as internal immigrants and as migrant workers. The 2010 Chinese census found 9 million of Shanghai's 23 million residents (almost 40%) were migrants without a Shanghai hukou, triple the number from the year 2000 census. These \\"New Shanghainese\\" () are generally distinguished from the Shanghainese proper as they usually do not speak the Shanghainese language or have it as their ancestral home. Comparisons can be made between the vast proportion of immigrants and immigrant-descendants that make up the population of Shanghai and that of New York City in the United States, historically a hub for immigrants to the country.  Definition  Group of men at dinner. Shanghai, China, 1874. The term \\"Shanghainese\\" may thus apply to several different groups of varying exclusivity. Legally, it refers to those holding a hukou for one of the local governments in the municipality of Shanghai. Culturally, it most often means those who consider Shanghai to be their home city, although this is sometimes restricted to those in the central districts or who speak the Shanghainese dialects of those districts (as opposed, for example, to the mutually unintelligible sub- dialects in Jinshan). The term Shanghainese may also refer more broadly to people from areas of the Jiangnan cultural region in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.  Shanghainese diaspora Although Shanghai was long a cosmopolitan city as one of Qing Dynasty's treaty ports, its people was not connected with the large- scale emigration seen amongst the Fujianese and Cantonese. Maritime commerce did, however, create a Shanghainese community in Hong Kong. These Shanghainese or their forebears fled China prior to the formation of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party of China in 1949. Some actors and actresses on the TVB network, a television network based in Hong Kong, are originally from Shanghai, such as Liza Wang, Tracy Ip and Lydia Shum. More recently, appreciable numbers of Shanghainese have migrated to other countries. There is a significant Shanghainese community in Sydney, especially in the suburbs of Ashfield, Burwood and Epping. Less-prominent communities exist in the Chinatowns of other large metropolitan areas such as New York and San Francisco in the United States, as well as Toronto and Vancouver in Canada.
